Had a small family celebration at the restaurant and it was our first time there. Love the food and we will definitely be back again.
5
First time trying out the Sunday brunch. Quality of food was superb. Refilling of food was prompt. Would definitely return again
5
Enjoyed the food, service desserts and wine. Very consistent with their food and have been a repeat customer for years.
3
It was fairly crowded as I visited be restaurant on a Sunday. However, all the food items we ordered were pretty much average. Nothing much in particular to point out.
4
I started patronising this restaurant when they entered Singapore at Goldhill Square. It must be more than 20 years ago. I’m not sure if it’s still the same owners.So I ordered my favourite then, spaghetti vongole, which still as good. We also had a salad, margarita pizza and a grilled salmon, all to share. The dishes came out quickly and well prepared. The only negative was that they charges $2 for the bread basket
5
We live close by and had probably been dismissing it as ‘yet another Italian joint’ despite hearing positive reviews of it. Finally gave it a try and I think the pizzas have one of the best (thin) crusts I’ve ever had. I personally LOVED the crab pasta with tomato cream sauce and the kids are all over their meatball pasta - the meatballs are extremely moist! Went there twice in 2 weeks and I think this will be a regular family joint.Between us - 2 adults and 2 kids aged 6 and 9, we’d usually order the 2 pasta dishes and a pizza to share (the pasta portion is comfortable for one but the pizza, I think, can be shared between 2 adults) and such a meal, maybe with a beer/wine would be around $100. Heard they do a good Sunday brunch too

Al forno is an Italian institution for expats and locals alike who live on the East side of Singapore and the food and relaxed atmosphere makes the eating experience highly enjoyable.Particular mention must be given to Noel who makes everyone feel special due to his natural warmth towards people and adds to the already, very good ambience of the place.A great place to unwind on a sunday afternoon
4
A very nice place for traditional Italian cuisine.Atmosphere is cosy and relax.A place that serve traditional pasta, pizza ,dessert and some mainsPizza is a must to try and freshly made and bake in the wood fire oven .pizza crust was airy and chewy.Every bite is fantastic and satisfying.Love the tomato base pasta and the fresh ingredients that go into making the tomato base.Ordered a tiramisu for dessert,not the best but it was as awesome.A bad point is,the parking lot is limited and hard to get a parking space,but there are valet service available.A good place to gave family/friends gathering and will be back for more dessert

After reading such great reviews about this place, I decided to go there with my husband for his birthday lunch. We ordered a Burrata to share which wasn't too bad though I have eaten better ones.. I ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio with some veggies while my husband ordered Pollo In Padella and both turned out quite bad. The pasta was soaked in olive oil with no flavor whatsoever. The chicken that my husband ordered came with over-cooked and limp looking asparagus and completely runny white wine sauce. The mashed potato was also runny. Overall, it was a complete disappointment and let down. The only saving grace was their house pour Pinot Grigio. For a bill of $130 for 3 dishes you'd expect the food to be atleast decent. No complaints about the service though. Don't think will go back there any time soon

Many Italian or European restaurants in Singapore offer either unimaginative food or mediocre service and sometimes both! On the contrary, Al Forno manages to deliver a good dining experience thanks to their quality of food and service. We had beef carpaccio for starters, then went for risottos and pasta. Every table had a pizza on it, therefore we decided to share a classic pizza which had fresh mozzarella and basil. The crust had beautiful wood fire charred bits which were amazing
5
Good food, a little noisy as to be expected from a decent casual Itaian restaurant. Good porion sizes. Bring the children, not an issue.
Strongly recommend that you make a reservation for dinner on weekdays and weekends.
4
Food good and service good. Will come back again. Buratta is a must try and rest is up to you. Wine is reasonable.
5
Came here as couple. Enjoyed the al forno pizza and the pasta. Good size portion for the price and nice ambience. Pizza oven is a nice touch.
5
Great little Italian place that does amazing pizza and pasta. If you are in the restaurant then you can watch your pizza being cooked in the oven. I've been to the place lots of times and always been a very good standard.
5
Ambience is very warm and welcoming. It is great for family meals or even solo meals. Price is decent and definitely value for money. The serving is large for a single portion.
4
Great food choices n yummy,too. Cosy ambience. Lovely helpful staffs. We highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Visited Al Forno twice for dinner in last 3 weeks. Enjoyed the buzz and chatter of a busy restaurant. Service is consistently great, the servers are attentive without being intrusive, and always service with a smile. Between hubby and I, we savoured several dishes including the carpaccio, Parma ham with mozzarella, squid ink pasta, lobster pasta, pizza diavola, lemon ice and tiramisu. Starters were a very good size, pastas were al dente and flavoured so well, and my fave is the pizza baked in a traditional wood fire oven! Enjoyed them all tremendously. If you enjoy tiramisu, please order it for dessert... to die for!Will definitely be back to sample more variety from the menu.
4
Arrived there earlier than my reservation time and was allowed to sit and wait for my friend. Ordered the squid ink linguine pasta & minced beef pizza. Their pizza was thin crust & super yummy, squid ink pasta was good but there is sand in the clam shells but still edible. The atmosphere is quite noisy and the place is quite packed on Sat night after 7.30pm
3
An Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood. If you are looking for good comfort food, this is the place to be. Perfect for families but not for couples as it tend to be very noisy. I can hardly hear my partner. It gets a very low rating for ambience from me. If you are looking for somewhere quiet to have a nice dinner, this is not the place to be. It is also a little pricy for a neighbourhood restaurant. Parking is also very difficult here.
4
Three of us dined. Two had pasta - spaghetti carbonara and a cheese-filled ravioli - whilst I had a diavola pizza. All were very good; defined tastes and I particularly liked the creamy sauce and bacon in the carbonara. As we left I spied another table which had ordered the steak and a lobster dish both of which looked amazing. I know what I'm having next time
5
Authentic Italian food that was delicious with hearty portions. Wine was good too. Will definitely come back and recommend.
5
Had a beef carpaccio starter - very nice. Seafood risotto I had was very yummy, and very filling. Excellent portions! Keep it up!
5
We've been to Al Forno on Sunday Brunch. Good value for money, great choice of food - seafood (fresh oysters, prawns, clams), variety of pizza, pasta, meat, fish. Nice Italian homemade food and good service.
5
Food was excellent and authentic. Fire wood pizza was delicious, so are the pasta and tiramisu. Good place to chill with big group.
4
Excellent swift service from friendly staff. The flavours and taste to the dishes were excellent. A great Saturday night dinner to relax and unwind.
4
Great pizzas, an Italian friend revealed that 'Al Forno' actually means 'To the Oven', and so the pizzas did live up to its name. Authentic down to the espressos.
1
Service staff was slow and rude. We had reservations but was made to wait for 30 minutes while they sat walk-in customers. When they were ready to sit us down, we informed them that we will fore go our reservations and left the place.While reviews of food may be good, the poor service culture means that they will not see us returning for a meal
4
Theres nothing like Sunday brunch but sometimes you can do without all the pompous hotel get up.Al Forno does a small personnel brunch with a family feel. Food is plentyful and of great quality as you would come to expect from the local Italian.Cost is very reasonable and comes in under $100 and that's with bubbles.Lots of choices to eat, kids are welcome and service is good
3
I was recommended by a colleague to visit a very decent authentic Italian restaurant, Al-Forno (East Coast) nearby our house, what impressed me were the wood fire baked hand stretch crispy thin crust with generous portion of fresh ingredients as topping and delicious tiramisu cake of less creamy version and as usual a bit liquor taste. The food was paired very well with Italian red wine. The very interesting part of this restaurant is that they do provide a lot of varieties in their menu choices. I would definitely come back to Al-Forno again very soon to try on the different food. Hopefully, this restaurant can keep me impressed.
3
We came here to impress our friends who are Italian connoisseurs and brought us to another restaurant that was really good. So we kept our fingers crossed and- unfortunately - it didn't go very well. LOCATION: ok, easy to spot. Spacey inside.FOOD: average. I would expect better quality for those prices. For these kind of dishes there are many more options in town that will not kill your pocket. Some 'creamy' dishes that In Italy are not like that at all (usual average Italian restaurant abroad), but the cherry on the pie was when the waiter served us a pre-made affogato (just a kind of frozen coffee ice-cream), trying to explain that this is a real affogato - God help me!SERVICE: kind chaps serving you food, but not up to expectations for prices. Not knowledgeable.Anyway: our friend were gracious enough to admit it was not their best Italian experience, but they enjoy the company....Will we go again: no
5
I keep going back because the food and the service is amazing!!! I love the Burrata, meatball pasta, and risotto!
5
Excellent food! Really enjoyed the time with my family and friends here. Pastas are delicious, also love the pizza diavola and main courses. Highly recommended!
4
Had requested for a nice quiet corner of the restaurant as we were having a business meeting there over lunch. Good food, nice ambience, friendly staff.
5
As always, great friendly service and a good choice of fine food and plentiful top ups of wine. A great East coast option.
4
Great service from the moment you step into the restaurant till you leave. Pasta comes in big portion and tasty. Pizza is great but could do better with the toppings.
2
We just moved here in East Coast and we always pass by this restaurant and looks always busy so we thought we give a try. Nothing special really...pasta and pizza are okay and not worth the price you pay. We ordered pepperoni, pasta w meatballs, pasta w squid ink and lasagna
5
This was the first time that we tried their sunday buffet with wine and it was excellent.Very good variety of food, very good service, very nice atmosphere with families, friends and couples.We will definitely be back.A lot of credit goes to the Italian owner and his passion for what he has built along with the dedicated staff that he employs
5
Took dinner here the other evening. Tried to call to make a table reservation but lines were busy. So turned up without reservation and just managed to secure a table. Not surprising given the high quality of the food.The pizza and pasta are both excellent - the scallop starters were good, but the dessert of tiramisu was to die for - absolutely delicious. I chose lasagne for mains - Garfield would have been delighted. Lots of meat and sauce. If your family are at home - easy to take back meals from here. Nice selection of wines by the bottle or glass.The owner comes around to the tables to enquirer your satisfaction. Good attentive staff - rustic Italian atmosphere. Fantastic service. Loved this restaurant - been before but not for a few years. Even better than I recall previously. But don't forget - best to make a reservation
1
Booked for 7 ppl. We were given a table with fit 5.We could not order much food, and the table could only fit 2 -3 pizza. We have to adjust the plates when food arriving.Very disappointed with the staff over there as I have already raise my concern, but nothing is done.. service is ba
4
Super cozy interior, a bit old but reminds us of a very traditional Italian restaurant. You can see the chef working on the pizzas and firing them in the oven.The pizza was the best I've had, the crust was phenomenal and with lots of fresh mozzarella and basil it was perfect.The pasta was good however the cream sauce needed more seasoning.Overall very good, we would definitely come back to try more things
5
Service crew was very attentive and refilled our glasses whenever they were low. The seafood is very fresh and portion was enough to make us full.
5
The food selection is always very good and different each time. The staff are always very friendly. One of my favourite places for a brunch.
4
Overall everything was good but got a little crowded by late evening and staff was short-handed. Nevertheless, nice good and nice ambience.
4
Good value for money; great variety of food. Enjoyable experience with the family.. limited for vegetarians.
5
Al Forno is a great Italian place with good food, great staff and large size pizzas! Really enjoyed it.
5
Excellent choice recommended by our hotel. lovely friendly staff. Was busy a good sign and popular with families. We could not resist the deserts.A bit expensive but worth it
3
The Congolese lacks the oomph. Bruno's was much better. Service was ok, but they mis placed my bread order. Cod fish was disappointing. Bland taste. Not a return for me, but not a total reject. It's so so.
5
Finding a good italian restaurant is pretty tough here in Singapore but I am glad to find this little treasure along East Coast Road.Carpark is a little hassle around the area but Al Forno do provide Valet services which makes it convenient for all drivers. Perfect ambience but do expect a little more crowd on Fridays / weekends. Staffs were brilliantly approachable and friendly. Service was equally fantastic too. Their lasagna is worth the try! Perfect combination of bechamel sauce / tomato sauce along with well cooked layers of pasta. You will also be able to feast your eyes with the "Live Pizza Making" station right beside the cashier.Highly recommended 
4
We actually dined here twice during our holiday but have to say that I very much preferred the Sunday Champagne Brunch experience which had a fantastic selection of food and virtually unlimited drink to the Friday night a la carte Staff on both occasions were brilliant
3
Reserved table but it seems like reservation not required when I arrived at the restaurant. I was asked to select any available tables instead. Staff was friendly. Food was great. Valet parking service charge is expensive
4
Overall a sumptuous spread , good iItalian cuisine , good ambience and good service . Will definitely dine there again .
4
Good eatery serving fresh authentic Italian food. Wood fire pizzas and Crabmeat pasta are must. Limited parking around the area specially during weekends.
3
Very good pizzas, they get crowded so do make your reservations online! will be back just for pizza!
4
Good authentic Italian food worth your money. The spread was just nice for lunch time. Service was good and friendly.
5
We love Sunday brunch in Al Forno and highly recommend it for authentic Italian food and brick oven pizza and good variety of pasta!
4
Very good service from entering the restaurant until we left. Atmosphere was very suiting for couple dining. Food was very good!
5
The food is amazing! Be it pizza or pasta! Whether you are vegetarian or meat lover there is something for everyone. Service is just marvellous!
5
I've been here with a colleague for dinner in December 2016. After one week in China we needed something Italian and Al Forno is like to be at home. Very nice restaurant, food is wonderful as well as the wine selection. Salad dressed in Italian style and pasta that is superb. We wanna go back to taste pizza, looks perfec
2
I haven't eaten here in a few years - prior to that every week for 2 years. So I was happy to see the quality of ingredients and dishes were still very good. The cheese, pasta sauces and home made meatballs - great. The service - AWFUL. This place is always busy so no excuses. The wait staff had no idea how to serve, were passing hot dishes across the table over us, even though they could walk behind everyone to serve. They poured tap water into my glass of sparkling - no apologies, young guy just moped off ... please train your wait staff your customers deserve it!!!!'
4
On my way out for a walk on Sunday at the East Coast while my gf is at church I stumbled across this Italian restaurant promoting a Sunday buffet at $70++ including Boose....and I thought I can't go wrong on that. The restaurant is full so sitting outside but the staff are very helpfull filling up my wine even before I finish drying my glass - and that doesn't happen often....Great food and a good set up before my walk and I enjoy plenty of food....and wine now that I have adopted the 5+2 lifestyle shedding 11 kegs and not gaining weight even after a splash out like this.Great Affordable Sunday lunch - highly recommende
4
Had a great time at this place. Excellent food and excellent service. Their tiramisu is a must try. Like their pizzas better than their pastas.
5
Value for money with great atmosphere friendly restaurant, highly recommended for family / friends gathering
Booking in advance is a must
5
It was my first visit and I was with a group of 10. The food was good and the variety appealing. On top of that, the staff were friendly and efficient.
5
Excellent food and service. Cosy restaurant which is very suitable for families. Loved the pizzas and cheese!
5
We have eaten at Al Forno twice now and have come back for the great authentic Italian taste of their food. The Pizza is prepared in their wood fire oven and has a superb crispy base. For the Pasta Carbonara we asked the restaurant to make it Italian style with egg yolk instead of cream and it was excellent. Can definitely recommend the restaurant for a good Italian lunch or dinner.
4
I went with a friend on a Sunday lunch as an alternative (both in style as well as cost) to a hotel champagne brunch. The setting is quite informal and we were looked after well enough by the staff.I'm glad that we arrived a few minutes before they opened so could have some of the finer items that were on display but not refilled during the sitting (oysters, cheeses).Some of the dishes were really rather nice (I recall a lovely veal) whilst others were somewhat middle-of-the-road (the salads underwhelmed). The pizza was thin crust and the three I tried were flavoursome and not too oily. They struggled a little to cook them fast enough. I didn't have too much of the pasta which came across as quite heavy; this is a downside of an Italian brunch.I was quite full by the time it came to dessert but had several pieces of the grandmother cake which was absolutely spot-on. Again it wasn't refilled but thankfully didn't seem as popular as it deserved to be.I'm not a big fan of prosseco but theirs was okay as far as it goes. The white and red wines were quite nice, and whilst we had to ask to be topped up more often than not, the busy staff did so happily.I'll be back for sure but probably a midweek evening for a la carte
4
The first time I went to Al Forno was in 1995. I could not remember what I ordered or how the food tasted or how much the meal costed. This time around, I had lunch with a Friend and shared a pepperoni pizza, an avocado salad and a seafood pasta plus tiramisu and pana cotta. The food is simple home style cooking and the desert is excellent. Hopefully this institution will be around for many more years
4
My husband and I loves Italian food. So we decided to head to Al Forno at East Coast Road for our anniversary dinner. The restaurant is cozy and has a nice ambiance. We ordered white wine vongoles to share as a starter. The portion is very generous and taste yummy. For the main course, we ordered risotto pescatore and aglio olio to share. The risotto taste nice but the aglio olio taste a little blunt. We will definitely come back to try more pasta =

Always a Favourite, Al Forno Italian restaurant in the east of singapore is a great place to go with the family, my kids are younger.Having said that, the table next to us was a girls' Friday night out and they were having a great time too.The menu is not long but when we asked for a simple spaghetti pesto the Chef obliged; good service from the kitchen and bless the staff for asking and taking our request back to the kitchen. Normally the standard service response in SG is 'sorry, cannot' so we really appreciated that Noel (our server for the night) was flexible for us.The penne polpette (meatballs) were tasty, juicy with a rich tomato sauce but most importantly were kid-pleasing.Best thing was the dessert which our kids loved; both the tiramisu (yes, I know it's got Tia Maria and coffee...bad things for kids) and the dark chocolate ice cream were delightful.So; top marks for service from somewhere that is not a CBD restaurant (the staff can think for themselves) and doesn't have to suck up to the big bucks banker types and a high rating for the food. As can be seen from the rating by my 6 year old in the photo....future reviewer for sure

We used to be regular al forno customers, eating at the restaurant, and also regularly ordering delivery pizza on evenings when the convenience made sense. This past Sunday evening, we both had a busy day so ordered pizza, veal and salad at 645 pm. By 8pm nothing had arrived so we phoned and were abruptly told that the delivery policy was anything less than 2.5 hours! Another 20 minutes later, the food finally arrived. To add insult to a very lengthy delivery time, the pizza and veal were stone cold. We called the restaurant again to voice our complaint and to give feedback to management that we would not be continuing as regular customers given the poor service. Very little empathy shown by person who answered the phone, and to date we have heard nothing from restaurant management. In the interests of trying to be fair, while still being quite upset about our service experience, al forno know how to make a great pizza. If you get a chance to taste one of their pizzas straight from the oven, it is one of the best in Singapore. Unfortunately, the experience last weekend has annoyed us to the extent that I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on. If you do decide to eat at al forno, goto the restaurant in person and skip delivery
4
Nice and cosy environment with friendly & approachable staff.
Food was decent and service was prompt.
5
Food is good. Service is excellent. Money is well spent with the food quality provided.environment is good.
4
You can't often say that for an Italian restaurant but this is one good value for the quality. Place was packed when I went again so don't expect sterling service. The ambience is more a family event than a romantic night out, fairly noisy since the tables are close together. The house wine is quite decent. pasta, pizza are tasty & should satisfy your Italian craving
5
I absolutely loved the food and ambiance of the restaurant. The service staff were well trained and performed well. The only problem our party of 9 faced was parking. The lots were limited and we had to wait half hour for the valet service which some of my party didn't appreciate
4
While the ambience is simplistic the quality of the food makes up for it. Price a little on the high side for the location and finding a parking is a challenge. Overall, however, the pizzas were good though the so-called signature dish - Pizza Al Forno was a bit of a let dow
3
For appetisers 1) garlic bread- Super flavourful garlicky goodness 2) seafood soup. Just so so with fresh seafood ( wish was more generous with seafood portions) Mains 1)rack of lamb- oh Soo gooooooodddddd yums 2) spaghetti al forno- I think it's been localised to suit sg tastebuds won't say it's bad but just not wow .(a hiccup happened had to send back my food & shall not mention why and served fresh again) Dessert1) tiramisu ( on the house) - Super lovely . A literal lift me up dish:) On average it's a okay place to dine. Just find the room radiates noise louder than other establishment . Kids friendly though which always a good thing for families . More of a family type establishment.
3
The decor is homey but the ambience was not at all enjoyable - the place was very crowded with staff and it was noisy despite there being only a few other customers in the place. The food was just above average. We had sand in our vongole (clams) quite a common flaw in Italian restaurants, which was not impressive. Service is subpar for an establishment of that caliber. E.g. No "thank you" from staff when paying the bill. All in all not so worth the price we paid.
1
Not sure if we ordered the "wrong" dish. I had a spaghetti vongole, my husband had ravioli. Both pastas were unexpectedly bad. I said unexpected as we did not think that an authentic Italian restaurant would serve such quality to their guests - two Italian looking men were making pizzas. The spaghetti was soggy and tasteless , whilst the ravioli tasted as if it was cooked from frozen.I guess if we were to visit again, it's safer to order pizza to avoid paying for expensive bad food.Service today feels kinda like we were in a fast food joint. Menus were slapped on the table, and we both felt like we had to eat quickly to make way. Our $85 dinner for 2 lasted us less than an hour.
5
The 3 of us visited current outlet on Friday 6th Jan 2017 for lunch. We reserved a table for 3 via Chope. There was no crowd on that Friday lunch hour. We ordered squid ink pasta, wrapped pizza and seafood rice. We make it a point to have variety for sharing and to taste their different options in the menu. :) Glad to feedback that all are still as good as it were when we lasted visited their former outlet at Goldhill Square near Novena.. Service quality still wonderful. For desert, we ordered their must try homemade Tiramisu. Must say their homemade Tiramisu quality and taste still remains. It used to come in a glass but now comes on a plate. But still as good ! Would return again when our crave for pasta/pizza/risotto and Tiramisu resurface :)
3
Use of dried instead of fresh herbs made for a very expensive and very disappointing Caprese salad. The risotto, while quite generous with sea food, lacked seasoning. Pizzas were reasonable.Service and environment good. Wish they could work on the food. For the price, not good enough
5
Al Forno Restaurant is one of our family's favourite eating places. The food is great (especially the Pizza, Calamari & Zuppa) & service friendly. We could dine in T-shirts & shorts & not feel out of place.
5
No other Italian restaurant comes close to Al Forno! We occasionally try other places but always come back. The food is delicious and hearty. You can always rely on an amazing meal from here.
4
Pizza and the soup were good. The squid ink pasta was something which was new. The overall service was a bit slow.
5
Very good spread of Italian cuisine and constantly replenished! It's usually full house, so remember to make reservations in advance.
5
Felt like a whole new place.
Great for romantic dates. Prices are not too high either. The staff were friendly and the service was great.
1
Al Forno has been around a long time and usually the food is pretty decent. This time however, everything was tasteless except for the Burata. I think the standards have gone down.
4
My last visit in 2016 made me come back again for a bday celebration. Ordered the clams in white wine sauce which was an excellent apetitiser, coupled with salad and Lamb. The cappuccino and tiramisu for dessert complete the lunch experience
4
Dined here with 5 others for an office group dinner. The restaurant has a relaxed vibe. The service is a mixed bag, but generally is ok. The menu is long and the pizza selection was great. We had a variety of salads to share. The burrata salad was particularly delicious. The pizzas were large, crispy and thin, with a decent amount of toppings. We had no room for dessert but there was a good choice. For a casual meal out with friends and family this place works a treat
1
It was my first time visited this place after read good reviews. Turn out not as I expected. The staff were arrogant. We ordered salad and two pasta. Those came after 45mins waiting. We asked one of the staff, she just cut off by saying will check but never came back. Asked another staff who received our order, i told her to check coz the other two tables came after us already served. They never apologize. Food was not that great after all. Definitely won't come back
4
Grt place to dine in. The staffs are good and ingredients are really fresh. Owner was nice and courteous towards every customer. Food took awhile but worth to wait. Good place to try risotto as not all places sell authentic Italian risotto. Price is just nice for a fine dine.
5
I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service from staff and the good was so tasty, especially that pumpkin & bacon risotto
5
Al Forno is one of my wife's favourite Italian restaurant we go there to celebrate our special occasions. Would highly recommend their wood fired pizza and yummy pasta.
5
Al Forno is our home loved restaurant. The pizza is excellent and never once have they failed us.
It is almost like our comfort food that we misses and want to go back every now and then.
5
If you want authentic Italian food in a fuss-free environment, Al Forno is the place to go. No exceptions.
Must try:
Four cheese pizza
Sauté vongole
Meatballs
Osso bucco
Squid ink pasta
Tiramisu
Panna cotta
5
Came to this restaurant for dinner with family. We got here at 6.30pm and parking was a breeze. Staff was attentive and we got our seat (we booked online earlier the same day).We had pizza (kids love the hand made fire wood oven) and the spageti carbonara. Overall we had a good time
5
Having lived in Singapore for almost 15 years, Al Forno is still one of my top two go-to places for an amazingly authentic Italian experience.The pizzas are delicious, thin base with delicious crust... and really tasty topping combinations. If you love real garlic bread with lots of flavor you won't be disapointed (though your partner might be later if he/she doesn't have some!).Actually the whole menu is fantastic.. be it pasta or the various meat or sausage mains, though for work or team dinners (done a few here) the pizzas are very popular with everyone.Finally a word on Alessandro, the owner: this is someone with multiple decades of experience... and you can tell from the moment you walk in that nothing is left to chance. This is someone that instills perfection into everything... and I can apply many of his principles to other industries. Must come for some of these epic Sunday brunches this month
5
Absolutely yummy oven baked pizza and rich pasta. One of the most authentic italian tasting restaurants in Singapore I have been to. No frills so do not expect bells and whistles. Expect generous portions.. I would come in a bigger group next time to try more things on the menu
5
This is a true italian restaurant in every way. The interior reminds of Italy, and of course they have a stone oven. We ate pizza (Diavola) and it was the best I've eaten in a long while. The house red wine was also very good. For dessert we ate tiramisu and its was delicious. Like in Italy the owner served us limoncello and the also called a taxi for us. Great service and great food. Okey prices compared to other restaurants in Singapore. I would highly recommend to try Al Forno if you are in the area
5
Made a reservation for 10 including special request as we were expecting an elderly couple in our party. Had to cancel 2 seats on the actual day but no fuss from the restaurant at all. Excellent food, friendly servers, fast waiting time. Has been one of my favourite Italian restaurants since 10 years ago and continues being one
3
Pros: The restaurant has an old-school Italian ambiance to it. It's definitely one of a great place in Singapore for a get-together. They serve good authentic Italian food with a generous portion without having to burn a hole in the pocket. Their Hawaiian Pizza and Spaghetti Carbonara are definitely worth a try. Cons: My friends and I were extremely disappointed with the service we received from the restaurant's staff. When we arrived, we were standing at the entrance for at least 5 minutes waiting to be seated. Instead of approaching and welcoming us, the staff just stood inside the restaurant even though we made eye contact with each other. On top of that, they couldn't find the reservation that we made a day before. They made us stood awkwardly even though there were plenty of seats available. Upon being seated, the hostess presented the menu in a rude and unprofessional manner. In addition to above, staff lacked in attention to details.We also had an issue with our steak being too rare, however, this mistake was rectified by the owner immediately and we were pleased with the service recovery.Overall, the whole dining experience was still enjoyable despite the lacking of initiative from the staff. Special thanks to the owner's hospitality. Cheers
5
The seafood pizza was awesome. Nuff said. We drooled at the plates on the other tables but unfortunately we only have one tummy each. We'll be back.
4
Recommended by friends, this out of town was well worth the visit. Excellent seafood pasta for two!!! Steaks and other pasta great too. Wine from Umbria very good for a house wine.
4
One of the most authentic Italians in Singapore and very reasonably priced too. The seafood pasta for two to share was amazing. We will definitely return.
5
This has been my 5th time at Al Forno & still i get excited about eating their food! My personal favourite is the anchovy pizza
4
Food, service and ambience are satisfying. Not first time here. Will be back for more visits definitely.

Been here a few times and I love the atmosphere and the decorations of this restaurant Pros:- warm settings and ambience - the pizzas are a must have, you can see them doing it live there - price is reasonable- great for couples, group , family with kids- great for booking to hold a private event I feel as the unique layout is very nice - person running the place seems to be a foreigner, he manage to give that friendly and "Thks for visiting and see you again" acknowledgement to all customers he come across -owner definitely put in efforts to create this special layout interior designing of the place Pointers for that missing one star:- service level is not consistent, I remembered service was top but when I visited here this time, I was kinda put off by some of the service staff. They seems to employ a lot more foreign staff and they are not attentive or smiley to us- bread are cold - lobster pasta did not give me the wow and yummy effect this time - location is not very convenient and parking is not easy to find The place has its regular customers thus do make reservations before going down.Definitely a good place to try out and see the inside of the restaurant for yoursel

They have amazing carbonara! I went there for a birthday celebration and had a really hearty meal overall. The pizza is good as well but 2 pasta mains and 1 pizza were a bit too much for us both, other than that, loved the old-school Italian vibe and if you love a good carbonara, go to Al Forno
4
Chance upon this place one Sunday dinner. I am not a fan of pizza but the kids insist. And boy am I glad I listened the the little ones as it has become my fav dining place. The pizza is just so good. A real authentic Italian food. Had the veal and sausage too it was good though the portion is a lot smaller than photo. It is a place for big family gatherings and won't cause much damage in your pocket. The service is also good, owner himself is the friendliest. Always smiling, winking and never forget to say thank you and good bye to you when u leave the restaurant. Parking can be trying though so do come early. Also it's always packed with reservations on weekends.

Been visiting this establishment along east coast run for years. The restaurant is run by 3 Italian owners if I'm not wrong (one on the dining floor ensuring that operations goes smoothly, another in the main kitchen and the last guy making the pizza). All the items highlight the traditional Italian culture. Pizza is awesome (wood fired traditional Italian pizza) and my favorite pasta item is the farfalle salmone. If you're a fan of clams, do try their vongole in white wine sauce.

I would usually drive past this place and not even give it a second thought, but was brought to dinner there one day after work. We were given a bread basket..... if only it was warm bread. It was hard and cold, like it was leftovers from the previous day. Just chuck it in the oven for a minute or two and it would change the starting experience for the entire meal. Next up for starters, ordered the Parmigiana. All I can say in the words of the great Daniel Bryan..... YES! YES! YES!Extremely flavorful and as a starter, its quite a large portion. It was to die for, not that I would kill anyone for it, but just saying. Linguine Al Aragosta was what I had for main.The pasta was absolutely fabulous, though I was hoping for a touch more capers, but other than that, no complaints for the pasta. As for the lobster that came with it... it was overcooked. It became too chewy. The tail, which is supposed to be the best part, had meat which was too rubbery. But, fortunately the pasta saved the dish. If I had to order again, I would do without the lobster. Dessert. Now I know people say that desserts should cleanse the palate after a fine meal. I really didnt realise they meant it literally. Panna cotta with hot fudge sauce over it. That was what I ordered. What I had was a Listerine (mouth wash) flavored pudding. It cleansed my palate for sure. Made me feel like I didnt need to brush my teeth after that. Already had that minty fresh breath.Guess desserts aren't their forte, but we could close one eye since the rest of their food was quite good
5
Lovely cozy place. Best pizza i've ever had till date! Can't exactly explain why but the taste of their pizza is so authentic & delicious! Nothing like all the other pizza around (that are rather similar).
3
Comprehensive but not too complicated menu. Huge portions, Excellent pizzas. But ...
A small Spritz cost S$18 !! 'tho other drinks at market price.
Pre-prepared (?) Parmigiana starter nice but not sufficiently heated up.
Pasta certainly not al dente but nice sauce w/contents
4
Great food great place. Good service. One of the best Italian restaurants in the east. Will definitely come back again.
5
We ate here with friends last Sunday and were really pleased that having looked forward to going for quite a while, the food exceeded our expectations. The staff were friendly and attentive and the free flow wine was exactly that. Looking forward to our next brunch already
5
I visited here with some friends for the Sunday brunch. I was amazed at the selection of foods and also the quality. It was great to be able to try small portions of different things rather than one meal. They were also very generous with the wine, as soon as my glass was empty they had topped it back up! Which I didn't mind! The service is great too and all the staff were friendly. I will definitely be going back
4
I have never forgotten the intense, sligthly sweet taste of fresh San Marzano tomatoes contrasting with melting fresh mozzarella cheese are in a pizzeria in Ravenna, Italy back in the 70's. Al Forno's team is the closest I found and is the answer to my occasional pizza cravings. If you like seafood, the seafood spaghetti is an abundant offering of perfect al dente pasta with juicy & tasty morsels of gifts from the seas
4
Pros:- Homely setting with the built-arches- Efficient service- Hearty portions no matter starters, or mains- Well-executed dishes. Pizza al forno came with very clean-tasting ingredients that tasted excellent in each of its own. One can taste the freshness of ricotta cheese, feel the buttery goodness of melted mozarella, and the meaty sausages. The Parmigiana was baked in thick tomato gravy, sliced thick enough to feel I was biting into lean meat, and the generous cheese complemented the hearty portion well.Cons:- Cold bread- Colder butter- High prices(but there is value in the price due to big portions
5
We have been there many times for past 5 years now and quality of Italian food is excellent. The service is good and owner is always there to make sure all goes well and welcome all clients. Stays one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore in quality for price ! Pizza is one of the best in town...rare to find better. Nice atmosphere and price stays very reasonable. Thumbs Up!
5
Not located in a mall or busy shopping area, so what?Worth taking the time to venture to Al Forno as you won't be disappointed at all.Service is also top, genuine and rather fast.I can only recommend this pizzeria to those who enjoy quality vs. quantity :
3
Tried out this place last weekend! Liked their wood fired pizza and pasta. The sauce was great and the pizza very fresh and soft. However, the chicken in pizza and seafood in the pasta lacked seasoning. They tasted just plain boiled. A little bit of seasoning would have made the dishes better!
5
Been to al Forno several years now, and despite the popularity, food remains honest to Italian goodness and authenticity. Loved the calzone and lasagna. Always a pleasure to return!!!
5
The food was very delicious, portion was filling too, service was excellent(refill my water constantly, bring me clean new dishes, play birthday song to surprise my mum with the cake, etc) thank you al forno! Would definitely visit again!
4
Always great food! Sometimes the service is great other times not so, once really poor but the food is consistently good. We eat here regularly and had a bigger business meal here recently which everyone enjoyed. Doesn't brake the bank to eat here!
4
Had a capricciosa in this place and it was really good. The place was full of Italians, which must mean is authentic.
I just think $30 is a bit steep for something that costs about $3 to make, hence only 4 stars and not 5z
3
Went for Sunday brunch buffet. In general the food is good, certainly the pizza is great. Was a bit disappointed with the tiramisu which was too cold (seemed like had been frozen or just stored a little too cold). This took some of the taste away and the mascarpone based cream was more solid than creamy
4
A friend took me for dinner as Pasta Brava was closed on Sundays. The food does not disappoint and it was fairly priced. We left feeling satisfied and loved the fresh oyster. For us, service on that day was good as it was relatively quiet nigh
4
I have been visiting Al Forno since 2013 when I first visited Singapore, and was never let down. Literally all their dishes we have tried are wonderful and the staff has been very attentive and polite. Though it's a bit subjective and a mater of taste, a little comment on the inner decoration, the interior I find a bit indifferent or 'noting to make you feel special'; still it somehow maintains a warm environment and visiting al Forno is well recommende
4
I've eaten in the restaurant several times and it's always pretty good. The freshly made pizzas are amazing which is what I usually go for. The selection of wine is pretty decent and the pasta is also good. I like the pizza so much I often order it at home for delivery and its roughly 24-26 bucks per pizza. Would keep going back
3
We expected much more in terms of service and taste but it wasn't as per expectation. Don't get me wrong, it is still an authentic Italian restaurant.We had pizza as well as pasta. Pizza was just above average and tomato based pasta was very good.service was slow in a Saturday evening
4
Having visited a few years ago, my expectations were set fairly high. The food was decent but nothing much more than decent. Al Forno was welcoming and relatively busy for a Wednesday evening, but the dining room seems dated and lacking charm. My daughter loved watching the pizza being made and also eating it, it was good pizza but the other food items were nothing special. I would advise people to go if they like pizza onl
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the lunch spread, really good buffet spread. Excellent ambience and great place for family and friends.
5
The food served felt really authentic and the service is simply brilliant with very professional and polite waiters! Highly recommended visit for birthday celebrations or anniversaries.
5
The restaurant has a cosy atmopshere, suitable for family and/or friends. Very attentive and friendly staff.
Highly recommend their steamed clams as the appetiser - but do watch out for the little bits of chilli padi!
5
Food was good and good value. Service staff were polite. Overall a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend to friends. Reservations highly recommended too as the restaurant was filled up shortly after we arrived at 7pm.
5
Outside of Italy and some good Sydney Italian restaurants, Al Forno rates the best in Asia. The Sunday brunch is affordable and a must do to set you up for the coming week.
4
Very good Italian place with set menus as well which are very good in terms of price/quality. We had pizza which was good and a nice dessert. Prosecco is very cheap compared to most other places in Singapore, so here you can have one more! I think reservations are necessary because inside it was packed. There were two tables outside and we decided to eat outdoors. Nice area as well, so concluding I could recommend this to anyone if you're looking for good food without the fancy (and expensive) view or surroundings.
4
This is our good-to place when we have a pasta craving. All the pastas are good, but our favourites are the spaghetti cicale and spaghetti vongole. Ask for extra chilli if you enjoy spicy food.Service is good (can be a little slow when busy), staff are friendly, and you always see the owner busy clearing tables and taking orders.You know you've come to the right place for home-cooked Italian when you see the Italians themselves having a night-out here.A restaurant not to be missed if you are in the East Coast
3
My friends made the reservation. It was very busy. People were waiting outside for a table. The restaurant could use a makeover. What I liked was that you can see how the pizza is made. The bruchetta was very good. That evening I think I made a mistake by ordering gnocchi with 4 cheeses and the beef lasagna. Both were average. Friends had pizza. They loved it. Maybe Al Forno is best known for pizza and I should have ordered that.Waiters were kind
5
I went there a few times for business gathering. At one occasion, our group of 10 spent very good time there with good food at a reasonable (Singapore standard) price. It seems we could always get a seat and it was not overcrowded. Hope all these nice reviews would not dampen it down
5
Undoubtedly the best Italian and wood fired Pizza place in eastern Singapore, friendly atmosphere, good wine list, extensive menu and fabulous hand crafted pizza in a fantastic number of choices.Not to forget the Italian dishes to share with abundant seafood, fresh from the market and a must do is the Sunday Italian free flow brunch, an absolute topper !!!!The best in the East !!!
5
Dependable Italian restaurant in the east. No surprise they've been there for so long after other restaurants just come and go. :)
4
Nothing Flash but a great family restaurant on the East Coast. The food is good and family, wine list well priced and service good.
5
Amazing brunch. Had a lovely time with 14 friends and celebrated my birthday in style! I even had a special birthday creme brulee made specially for me! I will keep coming back. Thank you
3
I was there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was very busy and crowded when i reached the place. I thought the food should be excellent. However i found that the taste is not to my liking, they are all a bit plain. Normally Italian restaurant provided an entree with bread and olive oil or butter, but i did not have that night. The parking is also very difficult as nearby restaurants are also packed. All in all, i found it average
4
We also come back here once in a while. Whenever we do not want to make dinner at home we go to Al Forno to have our 'second home' dinner :) Food is always good, fresh and delicious. Its always busy (what I think is a good sign). Our children like to go there too, because they like the food but also because its a very relaxed atmosphere. We always recommend it to friends ! Enjoy your meal
3
This used to be one popular choice for good Italian pizza and pasta, but it seems to have lost its shine.Was there for lunch and had purposely made a reservation thinking that it'll be hard to get one on the eve of a public holiday. I was quite surprised to find ourselves the only diners there for at least a good half hour before another 2 small tables got filled. Service was proper and polite although servers needed prompting for cutlery.Food wise was just average if to compare with the wide Italian dining choices available. The well raved seafood bag was not in the menu while the calzone was disappointingly dry. Pasta was quite alright, seafood is fresh enough. Soup is nice and come is a big portion meant more for a main meal.Regrettably, it does seem that we are spoilt for choice elsewhere and if not for that fact that we are in the area (accessible only by driving and there are limited parking lots), I may not make a deliberate trip down for Italian food here
3
Had a family meal here and the only thing i will be back for is prob the mozzarella and prob the seafood pasta for 2. But then i am sure we are spoilt for choice so i may not be back despite the convenience. Food is ok, nothing to shout about for the price. Nice env and dessert is not bad. Not terrible but there are better choices.
4
I am a big fan of Al Forno. Their oven seems to produce the best pizzas I have tasted in Singapore. There's a great selection too. Some of the pasta dishes are not quite as good and the wine selection is ok but not as great as it is at some other restaurants. The ambience is great and it has the feel of a local, family restaurant and not a pretentious, haute-cuisine venue with zero character. I've eaten there countless times and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little slice of Italy in Singapore :
4
We have now been here a few times. The service is generally good and the food is great! The second time we are here the service was poor with one of our starters arriving after the main course and of course we mentioned this to them. There had been problems in the kitchen. They apologised and unexpectedly we were given free drinks and desert. A great way to resolve the problem! All visits have been great since!
2
They make some of the best pizza in town, but getting extremely disappointed with delayed deliveries.They promise to deliver within 1.5hrs, which is already a long time for pizza delivery to a location only 10-15mins away. It's taking over 2 hours before it actually shows up. at times even cold.The pizzas have not gotten smaller as well, which is disappointing
4
They use to have a branch opposite Novena Church but now they are left with this one. Food and service are good but expect to wait awhile but it worth it.
Cost wise is about S$20-30/person which is very reasonable.
4
I think price is reasonable for the quality of food served. A cosy place to dine with friends. I go for my pizza fix once a month. Wishing for some loyalty discount here. Haha!
4
Visited Al Forno for dinner. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Great service. Food was hearty and delicious. Overall good value!
4
Just around the corner from our house, but that is not the reason we've come back there quite often... Very good and tasty food.
Fast and friendly service.
Offers takeout as well.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the Sunday Brunch @ Al Forno. Buffet style, great selection of dishes and SGD 70++ including wine etc can't be bad...
(Non alcohol version for SGD 40++)
Will definitely be going back!
5
It was a recommendation from my PA that this is a nice cosy place to have good made on the spot pizza for dinner. Thank God we booked in advance through phone call. The resturant was half full immediately when it opened at 6:30 pm. I can see that it is a very popular place for family, friends and couple.  Parking is an issue if you want to Valet as there is no many parking lots. All we ordered are great and delicious. 1)Pesce al Cartoccio Main fish dish which is sea bass fish. We love fish. However for those who love fillet, you may be timid to try as the fish came as intact with head, tail and bone. The sauce is ao tasty that we finished all of the fish sauce and the olives. Waited long for his dish2) Spaghetti Cartoccio cray fish and seafood spaghetti is their signature. . Love that sauce and texture of the pasta. Waited long for this dish. 3) Prosciutto e FunghiThin crust pizza is yummy. All ingredients are fresh and hand made. Waited long for this but worth the wait4) Insalata Ortolana starterThough I am not a cheese lover, the cheese is fresh and texture smooth. The combination of greens and sauce is heavenly. We finished the meal by 8 pm. Crowd are still coming in on Friday night. W will be back for the brunch on sunday. 47) Spaghetti Cartoccio cray fish spaghetti19) Prosciutto e Funghi33) Insalata Ortolana starter their signature pasta dish and the sea bass
5
I have organised an event for Italian food lovers and we were around 25 people dining at Al Forno. The experience was fantastic, not only the service is attentive and fast but also the food came at the right time and with tastes that really reminded me at my hometown. Highly recommended is the Spaghetti al cartoccio, a 2-people pasta dish with seafood that will blow your taste buds
5
im from italy, so im quite difficult about the pizza. for italians, pizza hut or similar is crime against humanity... here the pizza is great, the ambience so comfy, the staff very attentive and smily. it is very difficult to find a place in singapore with good service and great food at the same time: AL FORNO score it! well done, i will be back for sure! i asked suggestion to the owner Mr Alex (he was making pizza himself!) and he recommended us a perfect dinner. friendly and not pushy at all, see you soon again and again
5
The squid ink pasta, seafood grill and the crab pasta were what both my wife and I had for dinner. The staff were attentive and because we had our booking at 6;45pm, and were accorded with the staff helping us taking a few photos for my wife's birthday album.We have been patronising quite a number of Italian eateries in Melbourne, Perth and Singapore and we enjoyed what we had at Al Forno. We accompanied the yummy food with a bottle of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.
4
I often visit Al Forno with my friends from Army every quarter in a year for their pizzas and pastas. It always meet my mark on great taste, good ambiance and friendly service. We always order proscuitto e funghi and spaghetti cicale and mixing other pizzas and pastas for variety. The place is always filled with couples, families and friends so I will suggest calling to reserve a seat to avoid disappointment. Service standard seemed to have dropped a little as the staff has overlooked on providing complimentary bread to us till we reminded them
4
Great food. Plenty of options on the menu. They are happy to customise as needed. Awesome pizzas. Friendly staff.
3
Maybe the pizza is one the best in singapore.
So-so service,quality food is not the best. Recommended for pizza
4
No better pizza's to find in Singapore. feels like being in Italy. friendly staff and a real pizza oven.
5
I have been meaning to write this review for a long time, but forgot to do so as I have been away from Singapore, in Thailand. I must say that Al Forno serves absolutely the *best* pizza I have had in Singapore for many years, and have been there many times at week-ends to enjoy it! They use a traditional wood oven and whoever makes the pizza does an absolutely superb job - every bit as good as it would be in Italy if not better. They are also generous with the toppings. I normally have prosciutto toppings, and the cuts they use are not only abundant but high-quality, lean meat. Any of the house wines I've had have also been excellent, making for a marvelous dining experience for anyone who wants a genuine taste of Italy here in Singapore. I would give them a 'perfect 10' and enthusiastically & unreservedly recommend this restaurant. Let me hasten to add that I am in no way connected with it, so have no personal, vested interest at stake
4
I was here the first time in 1999 and it has hardly changed at all since then. That is a good thing!!!The pizza is among the best you can get in Singapore and solid craft. It is not cheap, but quality is not cheap in Singapore any more
3
I had dinner at Al Forno this week with 8 colleagues. Overall the meal wasn't bad but I was expected much more based on the hype around this place. The pizzas were ok but the starters (salads, buffalo mozzarella, clams) were average. I'm going to give it another try but I'll stick to the pizzas. Will let you know how that goes
4
Great food and generally good service. Have eaten here many times without an issue.Ate here last night for our wedding anniversary, food was good as ever though I was slightly disappointed having requested a special dessert for my wife for the occasion that it was just a candle pushed in a square of Tiramisu. Previously when requested the plate had been decorated accordingly
3
The food is ok but the service sucks allways. Today I told that WiFi doesn't work and the answer was it works well. I don't normally care but today I had some business things to run. It would have been easy to release IP addresses just be resetting the router
5
I have been visiting Al forno with friends while in Singapore. We all had pizza and as a Neapolitan, I can confirmthis was the best pizza I had in Singapore. Alessandro the owner is a really friendly guy from Cava de'Tirreni, near Napoli, and food is genuinely homemade. The restaurant is clean and nice the service was impeccable. I'll definitively come back
3
Al Forno East Coast has been around a long time. It’s the kind of restaurant that never gets packed, but has a steady stream of regulars that keep it humming along. It’s where the locals go when they want a pizza, where the waiters call you by name, and where it’s so laid back they don’t mind making something for you that’s not on the menu. you can enjoy a casual dinner in a warm, festive atmosphere. Discover a variety of fresh, handmade authentic Italian dishes.. The food was average. Pizzas were just OK I have had better. The table service was very poor and disorganized. I would not rush back for a meal
5
We love Al Forno! Fantastic pizzas and pastas, friendly efficient staff, well priced wine and authentic Italian management make this a brilliant place for dinner on the east coast.
2
We decided to go to Al Forno on a Friday evening as my wife had fond memories of lunches with her best friend there about a decade ago. First of all, parking is a challenge here as there's very limited space in front. Nonetheless, one can find parking in any of the streets parallel to East Coast road especially in the vicinity of Telok Kurau Lorong M. We ordered the Penne Polpette pasta with tomato sauce, Linguine Vongole and the Zuppa di Cozze antipasti (mussel soup in tomato broth).The mussels were served in a large and generous portion, but the broth was overpoweringly flavored by herbs and we missed the richness of the mussels. Each mussel was of a good size, not wizened and old to be fair, again though the texture was tough because the cook had probably put them into the broth too early. It was more marinara sauce then a proper Zuppa.I was looking forward to the penne Polpette's meatballs, having missed good meatballs since moving back to Singapore from Europe. We were bitterly disappointed when we found the meatballs filled with badly ground up tendons, bits of inedible gristle and flavorless. This was the worst dish of meatballs we have ever had, even compared to commercial store bought ones. Just the worst.Finally, the linguine Vongole, or linguine with clams was served with a large number of opened clams, their shells opened wide for easy access to the flesh inside. This was unexceptional.Overall, I would say that at any price point, Al Forno was a complete disaster. I would not recommend anyone eating here, especially given the effort you'd put into parking. But if you don't mind bad food at high prices, the. The service was pleasant enough, and the restaurant is noisy, perfect for a family outing
3
There were 4 of us and we were there for dinner. The pasta (we had the spaghetti vongole and spaghetti with crayfish) was good and worth the price. The pizza (Capriciosa and Tropical) wasn't as good - there was too much dough, it was not crispy but it was dry. The mushrooms were chewy and the prosciutto didn't seem right. The place, ambience and location were nice and the service was good. It's a bit pricey. As the place itself is nice and the service is good, I would say that the overall experience would depend on what you order
5
The new Sunday brunch at Al Forno is definitely worth a visit. Not only were the staff welcoming and attentive throughout, the food was delicious and the price made it excellent value for money. There was an ample selection of antipasti, meat and fish, cheese and cold meats, pasta, pizzas (or course) and desserts. My prosecco glass was refilled frequently, as were the drinks of those in my company. The bread is the best I've had in Singapore - I'm sure people would travel from around the island just to buy their bread if they started selling it! It was served in little baskets which were available to help yourself to as much as you wanted throughout the meal.Of course, it can't be compared to the big hotels' brunches, but in many ways I enjoyed it more, and it's certainly great value for money. It's a great place to go with your partner or with a group of friends. It is an authentic Italian experience - a little bit of Italy in Singapore - well worth a visit
3
We visited on a Saturday night and we got quickly seated. first visit and the menu seemed fairly ordinary and rustic Italian. good to see many Italians eating here as well and an Italian chef/owner.service was swift until we had ordered our food and drinks but quickly downhill from there. Our starters came 15 minutes apart, wine arrived after the starters, mains arrived while the starter plates were still on the table and are main plates werent cleared until we asked for the bill. however, throughout the night about 5 or 6 waiters We're standing in front of the bar chatting.The buffalo mozzarella and parma ham were excellent as well as their wood - fire oven pizzas. The carbonara with cream forgettable. All portions were quite generous
4
When we walked into this place everything seemed wonderful this old east coast landmark has the look of an Italian tavern, the service was friendly, when the food came the portions were hearty, the food looked good but right from the appetizer to the soup, the pizza and the pasta nothing had flavor or character, it was all limp! And that was not because the Chef tried to make the food light or bland it's just that nothing seemed to click , it was just ok...It should have been 3 stars, the extra star is for the dessert (tiramisu) & coffee and the overall ambience since you do get the feeling of being in rustic (in a nice way) Italian tavern, but the prices btw are not of a rustic tavern
4
We made a reservation for eight people, and the restaurant accepted it without issue. We ordered a variety of salads, pastas, and pizzas. All were very goood. There was a reasonable corking fee for the drink we brought to celebrate. The service was above average, and the waiters struck the right balance between missing and hovering. It is a very expensive restaurant, but Singapore is an expensive country to visit :
4
I've been patronizing this restaurant for many years and I've never written any review till now. Why? Well, I just got back from a 10 days Italy trip and I've to say, this place is as good as being in Italy itself. Perhaps there may be differing opinions and views about this place but personally, this place really serves awesome and delicious yummy Italian food. I love their black ink squid pasta, somehow I never get tired of this must have dish everytime I'm there. Hope you guys will enjoy this place as much as I do
5
Since we discover this place we were literally addict to spend our Saturday dinner there.The unforgettable mozzarella fresh and tasty like the one at home.The excellent pizza.We were there more than 9 times and always was a good reason to be back again. Really trustworthy Italian restaurant.
4
A really fantastic Italian restaurant with the best pizza in Singapore. Had a great time the first visit where the owner was serving and engaging with patrons however, the second time when we went at lunch time, we found the food to be excellent but the staff serving us were rude and inconsiderate and we got the impression that they were annoyed that we arrived at 1.30pm. It was as if they were rushing us to enable them to leave from their shift. The lunch time manageress was particularly rude and ruined the experience for us. No matter how good the food is, if the service is bad, this is what you remember. I would suggest better training for the staff. As we are tourists, it did not leave a very good impression on us with regard to Singaporean hospitality.
4
A little piece of Italy in Singapore. But no reason to charge 20+ for a pizza or pasta. Atmosphere is very nice. Reservation suggested around weekend.
4
Can personally vouch for the penne carbonara, the penne vongole, and the mixed grill.
All delicious. Service was the best we've had here in Singapore (apart from Flutes, which is also excellent). Go! xxx
4
Visited it on a weekday with friends. Loved the place from the first glance itself. We ordered for Gnocchi and a veg pizza (mushroom toppings). The pasta was excellent, good portions. The pizza was just about ok. Excellent place to have some quality Italian food.
4
Good place to have a pizza on East coast, restaurant is not fancy bit quality of the food is good.
Kids are welcome and service is good.
5
The pizza here is really amazing and cooks quickly. The sauces taste real authentic too. If you in the east coast and craving Italian then this is the restaurant for you!
5
If I may 'dare say' this restaurant is our 'treasure' of the East. A Great Neighbourhood Gem. I am a very Big Fan of this restaurant and this Review is long Overdue. My parents discovered this restaurant in the mid 90s (same Italian owner till now - Chef Alessandro) and my family has been coming here regularly for our dosage of Italian food ever since. We even celebrated Chinese New Year Lunch here as it is a 'family' venue for us. Do note though that the restaurant gets really crowded over the weekends and reservations are highly recommended.What brings us back over and over again - is the consistency and quality of food here never changes. They have always maintained the standard, food portions are enormous and simply sumptuous. I understand from the Italian owner that the main chef in the kitchen (also an Italian) has been equally working there since the 90s. Wow! No wonder they managed to maintain such standards in culinary skills. Its like a mini-Italy on some nights when Italians meet there for chats, sing and play cards together. Its always been like this - a cosy 'family' atmosphere. The only setback you may have with this joint is the carpark space . Insufficient number of spaces for its crowded patrons so I have seen people parking at all areas surrounding the restaurant. (Chef Alessandro - its time to consider valet) I simply cannot describe the food - it is by far the best authentic Italian restaurant around. You must try their house special - Spaghetti Cartoccio - monstrously sized dish that is beautifully seasoned and overflowing with crayfish, clams, mussels, king prawns and shrimp. Their Soute Vongole is made to perfection - you can taste the white wine and juice from the clams coated onto the pasta - my personal favorite.My father travels to Italy often for work and he says that Al Forno by far is his 'portal' to experience true Italian flavours. If you want to know how real pizza should taste like - this is definitely the place to go- the real traditional Neapolitan pizzas. My favourite is their misto carne pizza. It seems patrons come from far away areas to try out their tiramisu too. I can understand why - the tiramisu really does live up to all the hype - moist and light!I have sent a few of my friends here (Uni. friends and working colleagues ) and they were blown away by the food as well. Don't miss a chance to eat in this lovely place

The pizza is of great quality and also the other dishes that we have been having in the restaurant.Delivery is not their strength tonight the pizza arrive with no topping all leaked out on the side. For the price of 55 SGD for 2 pizza you expect more. Suggestion make a note in the delivery note maybe it works for you. We will not do take out anymore

Seven of us family meal, ordered a range pasta dishes and Pizzas none of which was great. the pasta sauce was the same for all of the pasta dishes and tasted like it had been warmed up straight from the tin without any seasoning at all. The Pizzas were only sparsely populated only just cooked and not particularly tasty. For what we paid it was pretty poor value for money. Wont go again

I must say, even if i just review Al Forno once, it is my favourite restaurant in Singapore.The pizza is, in my personal opinion, the best in Singapore, the sea food and sea food pasta are just delicious and the service is alway prompt, kind and smily.I go there at least 2 twice a month (if i am in Singapore) and it never ever let me down.Alessandro is a great person, very knowledgeable and friendly and the price it is very very affordable

On East Coast road! adjacent to Peranakan Hotel. A great family restaurant, wonderful pizza in a wood fired oven, Try the Parmigiana, it is just wonderful with hot focaccia to go with it. This is good down to earth Italian food. I ate there every week for two and a half years, never had a disappointing meal. Open lunchtimes and for dinner. Great prices for good quality food
5
Had the Risotto Pescatore, probably the best risotto I've ever had. The portion of seafood was too much for me to finish. The crayfish pasta sauce was pretty good too.
5
If you are in Singapure and want to eat a real italian food here is a good option!! The food is delicious and the staff very attencious! You should try!
5
Out favour italian pizza and seafood restaurent, crowded in saturday night, services and food still good. Pizza and bread are fresh and delicious
2
Try once if you have spare cash. Service is bad. Food is good though. But for that price, it's not a place I will go back again.
5
Restaurant was not too crowded, just 4 or 5 tables, good service, the pizza is made at a special pizza brick oven, good quality, good size and accompanied that with a good glass of italian cabernet / corvina blend. Definitely would recommend it.

If a Rome-born Italian brings you to an Italian restaurant in Singapore, it must be something good and authentic. We came for lunch on a weekday and the place was occupied with another 3 tables, hardly considered a crowd. Our Italian friend, spoke smooth Italian with another one of the cooks, (Alessandro was not in yet) and our starters were ordered quickly as it was already 1pm.We had:1) Burrata & Pomodoro; Prosciutto & Bufala; Parmigiana and Frittura di Pesce;2) Pizza Romana; Diavola; Pizza Primavera; Margherita;3) Linguine Al Aragosta; Tortellini al Prosciutto; Lasagna Beef;And 2 bottles of Chianti. Dessert was their tiramisu.Starters were polished off quickly and no one had any comments, only lots of “Mmmm, yum!” and “Please pass the …..”. Pizzas came next. Served piping hot from the wood-fired oven, we cut “quarter” wedges and chowed-down! The expressions on our faces were bordering on “déjà vu” and savoring-with-closed-eyes. By the time pasta was served, we’re already half-full. The Owner, Alessandro, then walked in with his family and came around to greet us. We joked a round and he looked a bit offended (like any Italian) when he found out we didn’t order any mains! After much Italian gesturing and colourful Italian words were exchanged, we settled for his Stinco di Agnello Brasato and Misto Carne. The meat from the lamb shank was just melt-in-mouth.We had no complains nor negative comments about the food or the wait staff (who were excellent) and would return …… only if our Italian buddy were with us and helped order the food

My 2nd visit after a few years.Good Service, staff was friendly & prompt service. They charged $20 for corkage for BYOB (bring your own bottle). Which I thought was fair.Food still has good, Great Pizzas. Must try the seafood platter & clams.Group of 5 & we had a bill of $200, which I thought was reasonable considering the food we had.Suggest to make reservations

We used to love going to Al Forno Restaurant, it was our "go-to" place for special occasions. But recently, their quality has fallen a bit. Not bad, but just average. Their pizza is still good. But it will probably be a while before we go back
4
I've been there many times, I think almost 50 times in two years, I often go there with an italian friend just for casual dinners, without expecting something fancy and pretentious, food is very simple food (international-oriented italian food with some specialties from Italy on demand only), people and service are nice. Chef Alessandro is very welcoming ! I always feel good entering this restaurant and talking to a smiling staff.The only bad point is the place is very noisy and we can hear cutlery banging against the plates, and due to a low ceiling, when the room is full (capacity about 100 + pax), volume is way too high (laughs, screams etc...). Moreover when the staff washes at the end of the service, they just drop the cutlery and plates miserably, we have the feeling being in a refectory like in our childhood time
3
Overall this Italian restaurant was ok but considering it is in Katong it was I felt expensive. The food was average. Seems that the Chef is Italian with a proper bread oven which helps the authentic atmosphere but when we were there the Italian "family" where all gathering for an occasion and where making noise and generally they created a distraction. Also aircon was too cold
4
The food was expensive by East Coast Road standards, but worth the money. The portions were eye-poppingly large and we had to have a take-away which served for next day's breakfast.
Nice clean place - do try the calzone...
4
We chanced upon the restaurant by and it was already very crowded. We managed to get a seat. Totally enjoyed the pizza and the seafood pasta. Mmm...
Only thing is I find the place to be cramped. Could have been more comfortable.
4
Great pizzas, casual atmosphere, rest of selection just ok. Location a bit far away from city center.

First visit in years to Al Forno and were very disappointed. The service was excellent and that is where our positive experience ended. For such a busy restaurant I was surprised that no children's menu was offered.We ordered a plain cheese pizza for my children which was to say the least average.I ordered the Pasta Alforno (prawn and fish in a creamy tomato sauce) ... this meal arrived so quickly before everyone else meal. The pasta was ok but was lacking in flavor. There was al ot of fish and only one large prawn with shell on which in order to eat meant getting very messy to shell it.My DD ordered the calzone and was disappointed with the ice cold tomato sauce that was served all over it. (apparently this is how they always serve it). In addition to the cold sauce the calzone which said ham and mushrooms actually came with shitake mushrooms. I can understand that shitake mushrooms are cheaper than button mushrooms in Asia but they really kill the authentic italian flavor of a meal.Overall I could have cooked a better meal at home. Will not be back ever

We went to Al Forno and ordered their pizza al forno and lobster linguine. The pizza is still very good but the lobster itself is pretty bad. It totally lack the texture and taste of a lobster, I wonder if this is some farmed species. As this is under the Chef recommendation list, I left the restaurant feeling very disappointed as it took us quite a while to find a parking space which is about 20 mins walk away. Think I will just order the takeaway pizza next time...
5
First visited Al Forno was in 1998, and have been going there on and off. my last trip was 1 month ago, the pizza is still EXCELLENT, SautÃ© di Vongole is my personal favourite, Lasagna Beef is simply yummy... kind of disappointed with Frittura di Pesc (Deep fried squid and prawns ) - doesnt taste as good as it use to be. I gave Spaghetti Cartoccio a miss this time round but it's one of the best seller on the house!Let the waitress recommend you the wine, goes very well with cheese
4
Went there for a business dinner for 20+ pax. Service can be better. They kept missing out our orders. Good food. Dessert ain't so great. Tried a couple of Pasta.. they were good. Didn't get to eat the pizza but it was highly recommended. Will be back to eat again in the future

As other reviewers have said, there are a lot of good Italian restaurants in Singapore. I do not know that I would make the trip here from other tourist areas in Singapore for this restaurant alone. We are staying in the East Coast for business and found this restaurant to be a nice end to a day spent in the East Coast Park. I definitely recommend making a reservation though if you do not want to wait. We arrived on a Sunday at 7 and if we had walked in 5 minutes later would have had to wait for a table. The restaurant is cramped and noisy but I enjoyed that. Service was a bit slow and chaotic as tables did not seem to have a dedicated server. Rather, the workers seem to jump in as needed which was not very efficient at all. Everyone was pleasant though and seemed to be trying to keep up with demand. I had a vegetarian pasta which was very good and my husband had the fried seafood platter which he said was good, not outstanding just good. We spent a little over $50 per person for two mains, one appetizer and two drinks which for Singapore is not too bad. Overall it was a pleasant dining experience. Extra kudos to the water girl who went above and beyond the call of duty
5
Bring a big apetite the servings of great italian food are generous and tasty. The service is friendly and welcoming. Price for a feast of 6 people included pizzas, platters of meat and entree's reasonably priced. I will definitely be back. I recommend the restaurant for those nights you take the family out or large goup of friends
4
We have been going here for several years, as it is one of the best local Italians on the east coast. It can get crowded and it is worth booking at weekends. The restaurant is small, so can feel cramped, if you are not used to this style, but it has a great buzz and genuine Italian style feel. Pizzas are superb and other pastas represent excellent value for money. Wine is so so, but acceptable. Very much a family place, with your kids and old aunties
3
Food is ok, drinks ok with a nice selection of wines, the place is spacious and easy style, it has somehow the feel of an Italian Tavern.
Good to try !
5
imna big fan of bread and the bake 5 different types of bread on site everyday. if you're a carbaholic beware as you won't be able to stop

We've eaten at this restaurant three times now and we'll continue to return, We've enjoyed the food each time we've been here. Specific menu items we enjoyed include:Pizza Al Forno-The ricotta was creamy and lovely, the sauce was perfect, spinach was fresh and the sausage was mild and not greasy. The crust is wonderful, crisp and slightly chewy, just the way a pizza crust should be. All the pizza here will be fabulous with that crust as it's base!Scaloppina al Vino Bianco-Is tender and delicious. Portion size seems a little on the small side but it was perfectly prepared.Misto Carne-The steak was cooked perfectly as was the lamb. The sausage was delicious. It's a lot of meat, any carnivore will want to come back again and again for this!Pesce al Cartoccio-A wonderful meal of fish. Portion size is large, 3 of us shared after starters plus salad and veg. I would definitely enjoy having this again.Service at this restaurant is prompt and polite. I've been here when the restaurant was full with people waiting outside and I've been here when it's been less busy. Either way service has been very good
5
I have not visited Al Forno for a few years, since they moved to East Coast. After this recent visit, I will definitely go back there when I feel like having Italian. I had crayfish spaghetti - the tomato sauce was excellent - not overpowering. We also had pizza which was really good as well. There service was also prompt.
5
This place has the best pizza ever. A must try is the pizza with anchovies and mozzerella. Super good. We also had seafood pasta, but that was avarage.the service was prompt and friendly. The wine selection was good, we had the primitivo, which was recommended by the head waiter. At the end of the meal, we had lemon liqour . Italian style. The price, though on the higher range was worth it. I'd highly rcommend this place to any pizza lover
4
Spacious eating area, cosy atmosphere but a bit noisy. We almost had to shout at one another to have a conversation. Our choice: Garlic Bread, Squid & Prawn platter, Spaghetti Vongole, Pizza Capriciosa (w/Ham,Mushrooms). House pour white & red by the glass. Taste of the Food was nice, batter frow squid&prawn platter could have been better but still ranking very good, wine was well temperated. A minus for the mushrooms on the pizza: they were a bit chewy. Overall experience is very good. Service was efficient, friendly and professional

I've come across quite a few who mention how nice Al Forno is for an italian meal. But really after visiting, what is the fuss all about?! Service is very average, Pasta is very average, Pizza is average too! There is nothing about Al Forno that stands out for me. That very reason has kept me from returning till date. There are just too many other italian restaurants to try out in Singapore, and even when I crave for comfort italian fare, Al Forno doesn't meet that as well. So really I've no reason for a return visit at all
4
I wasn't quite sure what to expect when my company suddenly says that we are going to Al-Forno for our company farewell dinner, i must say that it's okay and the food is quite nice, not to mention the crayfish and prawns that one of my colleague ate, It was very appetizing and he just enjoyed it so much, what i had wasn't that bad either but maybe the creamy sauce is too much for me (penne Monte). My fiance had cod fish and it wasn't as nice as he think it is. He regretted a lot for ordering it, Well at least now he knows what to order next time. Not sure whether will make a second trip there but maybe for those who are looking for normal outing(not a date) or just a casual restaurant then that is the place to go to. The pizza is huge though and i am quite surprise that one of my colleague can actually finish the entire pizza all by himself. I didn't ask my boss how much does our entire meal cost but it must be expensive. overall experience i can only say it's okay and mediocre. So if you want to experience it then make your trip to the restaurant

I don't know how this restaurant gets ranked top 23 in Singapore! I mean it's decent food, sure, but nothing extraordinary! The place in East Coast has very strange acoustics which makes it so loud and hard to cope with having conversations. Forget romantic night out, you'll be overwhelmed by all the family groups having boisterous laughs. The pizza was pretty good, two pasta dishes were just okay
4
At Al Forno you can have a great pizza (better than many others pizzas I had in Italy, actually), good appetizers, pastas and dishes from south Italy. I think that pastas are just ok, nothing great, while their Pizzas are much above average and taste genuinely Italian. You can select quite a good variety of vines for reasonable prices and the desserts are very good. The atmosphere is relaxed and a bit loud since the restaurant is a big open space
4
The pizza is good, and the clams app is very good. Sometimes the pasta is excellent, sometimes just okay.
4
The food was very good and the service excellent. It would be perfect if they had an al fresco dining section.
5
Al Forno has to be one of the best Italian bistro's in Singapore! fantastic food, quick service and a great atmosphere. Its always busy which lends itself to a lovely jovial atmosphere.
Try the seafood pasta for two, Amazing!
5
Best pizza in Singapore with exellent genuine service! We will definetly be back. Lile being in Europe.
5
The best Italian Restaurant you can find in Singapore.
Food is excellent and the Pizza is the best in Town. Very Very reasonable and the atmosphere is amazing.
Service is very kind and prompt. Can't find anything bad about them.
The Best ever.

Usually go there to get an Italian fix. Great vegetarian pizzas made with good fresh ingredients and cheese, great eggplant parmigiano and very decent Pasta dishes. Very good value relative to a number of other Italian restaurants and very good informal and friendly service. Wines selection is quite decent and good value
5
I have been going to Al Forno for years ... the latest was last night. It is always fairly busy (popular) which I guess is testament to the quality of the food and overall experience.Over the course of 7 or 8 years I do not think I have had a bad meal there and indeed always enjoyed what I've had. Pizza is really good but so are many of the pasta dishes.Nice job to all concernedMic

This is the greatest 'EXPAT FIND' for us. We have been in Singapore only a month now. We are from Norway and relocated here due to our job. We have been hunting for good eateries in East Coast since we live there and discovered this fantastic great restaurent. We were drawn to the restaurent as there was a long queue waiting to get in. We joined the queue too. A little while later there was still no table so the italian manager offered us wine at the bar. Nice Gesture!!!!Food was simply great! We ordered spaghetti seafood which came wrapped in foil and of course their wood oven pizza. For the 2 hours we will there, the crowd was coming in almost non-stop and the staff were very fast with their service. It was truly enjoyable and we have been coming here almost every week now. Sundays are delivery days where we order their food and enjoy also at home. Cannot get enough of Al Forno. My wife and myself will highly recommend this restaurent to all who enjoy Authentic Italian foo
5
Al Forno is the BEST ITAILIAN Restaurent in Singapore. Not only in Terms of Food but also in friendliness. We could not finish our food and straightaway their staff came to check if there was something wrong with the food. We acted upon our hungerness and had ordered too much of food that we couldnt complete. They volunteered to pack the food for us. This is the kind of detailed attention that is needed in service industry - anticipating customer needs.Needless to say about the food, it was simply 'mama mia'. The pizza was great. I understand from my friends that they have added new varieties in the menu. Can't want to check it ou

Al Forno East Coast is a great restaurant for dates. family outings alike with a regular basis. Great service and good italian food. The Seafood Risotto is scrumptious with a rich selection of clams, prawns, squid in a tomato-based sauce. Amazing risoto, there pizzas are made on the spot and are typical Italian pizzas, not like they ones to get in Pizza Hut, and a great choice of pasta
5
No they are not the cheapest, yes they are excellent vakue for money . And time after time quality is consistent and service is excellent. Real Italian food, fresh ingredients , healthy portions and nothing else ...

Crayfish pasta for two is to die for...

Authentic Italian cuisine, but the price is a bit steep.

Good pizzas but the rest so so

Enjoyed the carbonara
4
the perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m.
5
Italian boss + Italian chef + Italian pizzaiolo, welcome to Italy and enjoy. Sometimes a bit nosy and very busy. Not at all a romantic place, it's just real good food with mama style portions. My favorite Italian restaurant, trust me, I tried them all ;-
4
i'm ItalianPizza is really good and pastas are home made and very well prepared, is not a fancy fine dining place and as never ment to be so but for the price you pay the quality of the food and the kindness of the Staff are absolutely great.Ciao Alessandro just continue like this

I dine at Al Forno (east coast) almost weekly with my family or friends. My experiences have always been pleasant although lately I've noticed its been crowded almost everyday. Have to wait for tables. The cheerful Italian manager Alex is always friendly and accommodating. My wife dislikes garlic and is a vegetarian and he always conforms to our wishes.Food taste as always been constant. Spaghetti seafood is my favourite dish there as well as their soute vongole. Their pizzas are simply delicious - the amount of diners there is the evident of an eatery that prides in fantastic food.Their homemade panna cotta is a must try.Al Forno is a cosy eatery for us in the EAST

Just went to try out this Italian restaurant for lunch yesterday. I stepped in with another friend at almost 2pm and the only male serving waiter there rushed to pull out the 'Close' sign on the door as soon as we sat down. Guess they close at 2pm for lunch. I felt as if we were rushed through our orders by the waiter. My friend ordered an Italian soda which took the waiter about 15 mins to come back and tell us that it was out. Our food came before our drinks. We had to ask for our cold water. Pizza was good, relatively authentic. I ordered a spaghetti carbonara. I've definitely had better. As I was finishing it, noticed a strand of hair amongst the pasta. Totally grossed me out, we called for the check and showed the strand of hair in the pasta to the waiter at the same time. He took the dish away WITHOUT ANY APOLOGY and promptly came back with the check, WITHOUT SO MUCH OF A DISCOUNT. This will definitely be my last visit. Horrible experience, with DIRTY FOOD AND TERRIBLE SERVICE (especially by the waiter) overall
3
a cozy family ambience. the lagsana was good. the seafood in our pasta were also very fresh.
5
They have one of the best tiramisu that I've tasted so far. Friendly Italian manager and food comes in large portions.
Fantastic, awesome restaurant.
