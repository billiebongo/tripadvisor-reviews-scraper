First time visiting this cafe. Had a wonderful time feasting on the delicious food and drinks and enjoying the attentive friendly service. Food came fast despite being full house. Bright cheery cafe. Very lively atmosphere. Highly recommended!
5
Great brunch served by them! Nice ambiance, cozy space and stylish concept and very quiet. Tried out their crab cakes with asparagus and avocados. Lovely Magic Coffee.
Nice spot to walk around can have a photography session along the lane.

Breakfast was not bad. However, there shall be rooms for improvement for the scramble eggs as the taste is too bland.

Strangers' Reunion is a nice neighborhood café our soon took us to a couple of times mostly for coffee. The Espresso, as also Long Black very flavorful. I once ordered a Double Ristretto which came accompanied by half a small glass of sparkling water. It's absolutely delicious and has a very lovable tang to the rather strong but smooth coffee liqueur and slow sips of sparkling water made the whole experience unique.The restaurant has some delicious meal options too including breakfast all day long. The ambience is quite that of a Parisian café and there are some very interesting books on Singapore to browse as you enjoy your coffee or meal.Last year in June the restaurant sadly lost one of their Chefs to cancer. What is truly appreciable is the fact that during his one and half year long battle with the disease the staff, as well as many regular patrons of the restaurant, contributed generously to help mitigate his suffering and later to help the family. Kudos to the benevolence of all.The staff is very courteous, helping and cheerful. Worth visiting again and again for delicious coffee

This is a mixed review as the kitchen let the restaurant and waiting staff down. The place is lovely and open, light and funky. It was busy too. The staff were really friendly and helpful when asking questions about the meals.We ordered the Crab Reunion and the Corn and zucchini fritters. Presentation was excellent and as we started to eat, we realised that underneath our poached eggs, the avocado was really black and disgusting. We complained and our waiter was mortified and went straight to the kitchen. He came back with lovely fresh avocado. The rotten avocado, should never have been used and hiding it under the egg didn't work. It did leave a bad taste in our mouth and spoiled an otherwise lovely meal. The rest of the meal was delicious and the staff reacted quickly and without question

2nd visit but my 1st visit just simply want to try the coffee and I can't even recall what I ate, probably just only coffee or the food really nothing to mentioned. I tried the Magic which is quite nice for me. this time i tried snclong coffee, I like it as now i like the strong coffee. We ordered the waffle with ice-cream and strawberry compote and truffles fries as I saw some other table is eating. The waffle is really good!! fries quite normal but i like the special mayo they served together with fries
5
We went there for a lovely brunch of smoked salmon and smashed avo! All was delicious, accompanied with very good truffle fries. After that we had seven spices latte and matcha latte - both lovely. Staff was very nice, the place was pleasant and the neighbourhood is gorgeous - it was our first time in this district in Singapore, definitely worth a visit
5
I went on my own coffee adventure to find the best coffee, you can call me a coffee snob if you like. This place is my #1 in Singapore the cappuccino was made perfectly and if the barista had been in a competition they would have got high mark
3
Finally got around to trying the coffee at this place. Unfortunately my cappuccino was just a little cool for my liking. Normally I prefer it to be warm to hot rather than like warm to warm. Strength was ok and taste was good. Popular cafe and a good atmosphere
4
Nice cafe along Kampung Bahru near Everton Park & Spottiswood Park in Singapore . It's pretty pack although there's a good number of tables in the cafe. Only has coffee there and The brews sea salt chocolate, white Magic is . Car Park can be quite a hassle as one will need to park at the back of the cafe ... and is car park coupon style . This means no overstaying at the Cafe as the attendants are pretty diligent in their rounds . Worth a try .
4
I very much enjoy the atmosphere at this little quaint coffee and breakfast place.
It's very tastefully decorated, has great coffee and the coconut chia bowl is awesome.
Great place to hang out on the weekend.
4
Nice cafe with good ambience. Staff is efficient and attentive. The waffles indeed tasted great as many other reviewers have mentioned. I'll go back to try the mains.
5
This is one place that never disappoints. Every time I visit it is a great cup of coffee and they have reasonably priced hipster-ish food. They have really good lotus chips with aioli!
They are closed on Tuesdays and really crowded on the weekends!
3
Quiet ambience. Neat place. Breakfast tea was ok. Hot chocolate was good. Can hang out with friends for a chat. Next time will try dessert.
5
My wife and I enjoyed our brunch here on the public holiday. My wife is a regular but my first time. Decent choices for brunch as well as lunch and a dinner menu.Food was very good - I had the avocado smash and my wife the crab cake- both very good as was the calamari.Big highlight was the coffee, which they take seriously
4
Excellent support for vegetarians especially if you like sweet things. We had mixed berries waffle, the amazing decadent hotcake, an avocado smoothie bowl, and the corn fritters. All were really good. For drinks we had macha latte and Sauvignon tea - I really like that tea. Excellent cosy place with an interesting menu and large portion size
4
I had banana chocolate waffles and a ginger beer. The waffles were lovely however my personal preference is for them to be a bit crispier on outside. The staff were attentive, helpful, friendly and very quick to serve and ask after if I was ok (about 8:30 pm on a Wednesday and with place just under half full maybe). The price was good value for Singapore (and if you are from London you'll be used to similar costs) and it's a very classy place, chill music and also welcoming. The other customers food looked good. Nice mix of ages in there and everyone looked relaxed. Be good for groups, couples and also I felt fine in there on my own.
4
We have been here several times and it never fail to disappoint. Love the waffles and truffle fries. Today we decided to try something different and we had the Crabcake Reunion and Spicy Baked Eggs. The Crabcake was amazing but something seems to be missing in the Baked Eggs. Nevertheless, this is a great place for coffee, dessert and brunch
4
Just come for the waffles - almost perfect! We had the milo with caramelised bananas and the mixed berries. Both came with ice cream and were superb!The "magic" coffee is a very delicious latte and complements the waffles well. It's a crowded noisy place so just wallop the waffles and leave happy. Not quite the place to linger.

It was not my 1st visit to Stranger's. I always like the coffee and food. Last Sat, 09 Jul 16, my partner and I went for brunch. We ordered 2 coffees - long black and a iced latte, 2 breakfast dishes and a side of Fries. When the coffees came, my partner asked for sugar (note: this is not his 1st long black in his life), the server (who seemed to be the cafe manager for the day) replied: "We don't give sugar. Please taste the coffee first. Our coffee are meant to be drank without sugar." Taken aback but we still wanted our sugar so we told him "Sugar please". He actually repeated his statement about coffee to be drank without sugar.Next bad experience: my partner food came first while mine came at least 15 minutes later - not complaining. He stopped eating when he's filled but I was still enjoying my waffles and fries. The same server came over to our table and asked if he could clear my partner's plate which had an egg on it. I told him "No, not yet." because I might want to have that egg. Right after I told him not to clear, he gave me a look on his face and said "It (the egg) was there for a long time already."I was really baffled. First No sugar allowed. Next, the egg cannot sit on the plate. I hope the owner would do something about this server
3
Pretty expensive, and they only had an all day breakfast menu or a dinner menu. Nothing in between for lunch. Food was good but quantity is small for the amount you pay for.
4
The cafe offered limited choices of main meals and dessert, however the foods are above average and well presentation. May have a try if passby
4
Had the breakfast menu salmon eggs benedict. The sweet hollandaise sauce is interesting and surprisingly went well with the eggs and salmon. I would recommend trying. Coffee is excellent though not the best I have tried.
5
Coffee connoisseurs and foodies, do check this place out. Had some of the best waffles and also coffee here.
3
The cafe was packed when we arrived so I guess it's popular. We ordered a cappuccino and a waffle with vanilla bean ice cream (they only have one ice cream flavour). The coffee was not bad. Vanilla bean ice cream was good too. But the waffle wasn't crispy enough on the outside. On the inside - we took a few bites to try to determine if it's cooked. First time here so not sure this is the usual or just inconsistency in cooking. Definitely not our favorite waffles. But the place feels comfy to just sit & chill (only if it's not so crowded! 
2
My 3rd visit has confirmed the disappointment is consistent. So much so, that I felt compelled to review on both TripAdvisor and Yelp, while waiting 30 minutes to have anyone come assist me. Their primary allure being that they are a contemporary brunch and dinner venue, in an otherwise local string of late night eats and karaoke bars. Definitely not worth going out of the way for. Even with my proximity to the restaurant (3 min walk), I hesitate to contribute to the profits of the proprietor
2
He might be Singapore's National Barista Champion but that is no excuse for the attitude of Ryan, the barista of Strangers Reunion. He was extremely rude to us twice, once when we tried to swap our stools for proper chairs with backs and then again when we wanted to pay. He had a scowl on his face throughout the entire time we were there. He might have been having a bad day, but that's no excuse. In the hospitality business, you have to be hospitable no matter what!Besides that, the music was too loud to have a converstion and the toilet area stank! I don't know what all the hype is about
1
the only nice things I could say about this place was that the name is kinda cool and their truffle fries were tolerable. All else was bad to say the least. Waiters were nice if we could get a hold of the few there...seemed understaffed! Each of the 4 dishes we ordered sucked
5
We had Salmon steak and Pasta! The ambience of the cafe is great and a nice cosy place to be at. Its not too far from Outram Park MRT and is around a 10min walk. Food was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent as well. However, we felt that the cafe was a little pricey for out liking. Nonetheless, we really did enjoy the plac
5
Had their mains and waffles. And I must first and foremost mention that their Red Velvet Waffles is really good. One of the better ones out there. Coupled with their great tasting coffee, it is simply a great ending to my meal.Oh back to the mains, it was pretty decent for their pasta but their Truffle Fries was a little disappointing for the price being paid
4
The place serves good coffee especially cappucino and Iced Mocha. The waffles and food are quite good.
In my opinion, coffee would be a 4-star but food would be more of a 3-star. Wish there were a rating of 3 1/2 stars in TripAdvisor.
1
Always wondered what the hype was about this place as its usually packed during lunch time.
Food was soso. Most of the food had eggs in it. I think the eggs are what they use in every dishes. Poached egg sandwich tasted gross.
5
This place is always packed, and deservedly so. Coffee and food are great. Occassionally there will be local artists and designers work on display. It's a great little brunch joint.
5
Love the cappuccino, it's got a hint of hazelnut and dark chocolate (imo, taste may vary). The buttermilk waffle is delightful, only bested by the warm service. Would definitely visit again!
2
The scrambled eggs are weird, I hate their "relish", the seats are uncomfortable and they are not family friendly.
3
Came here for lunch before I flew overseas with friends. I ordered their truffle fries along with a main, both which disappointed me. Tasted mostly like expensive french fries with very little truffle. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes? I'm not a coffee person, but i heard their coffee is good.Skip the truffle fries, I can't believe how bad it was (and the price did not justify it).I'd better at numerous other cafes in Singapore for the same price and they skimp on the truffle taste, truffle oil and salt. Too disappointed as this was quite the hype for a cafeWhen i was there, they were not crowded as it was a weekday noon
4
I was recommended to come here by a friend of mine and I did enjoy my lunch here. Food and coffee were good although it got too noisy at one point so it was hard to have a conversation with my friend. All in all, a good choice to come here for some good comfort food and coffee
5
I love the waffle, ice chocolate in the midday, and of course the cup of magic! When I visited, the place were packed, but the waiters still on their best services. I also bought a bag of beans. No wonder, this place is own by Spore's best barista. Yihaaa
4
Was there with 3 other friends earlier for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and Cafe Late. The ambiance of the cafe was great and cosy, compliments with great selection of music. It was not crowded so that was a plus. The food was great with generous serving of chicken. And last but not least, coffee was fantastic. I am a caffeine addict, so i appreciate when the coffee served live up to its reputation
5
Very nice ambiance. I love all the quotes found on their menu, bottles and the interior of the cafe. Big servings (for 2-3 people) on Truffle fries and chicken strips with green mango salad. I loved their greek yogurt with muesli. It is quite expensive, but the dishes were satiating
5
Best latte art, best hot chocolate, best waffles with ice cream and best brunch!
Would definitely be back for more!
Service was great!!
3
I have been here a couple of times. The menu is as best average, coffee is good though. Pricing wise, $1 for $1 I won't be back in a hurry.
4
stranger reunion is so famous in coffee snob circle. i try their cappucinno and pancake. their coffee is make it in the good way. their service fast. for the pancake is supper amazing, i ordered pancake with mixed berrry compote.
3
So I had 2 eggs with toast (and a small serving of tomato chutney?) and that's $10.50. Ordered another serving of avocado (that's half an avocado) and that's $3.50 more. So that's $13.50 before service charge and GST. And it wasn't very filling either. Other items on the menu are even more expensive. Sure it's a nice environment but you can only push the hipster envelope (and prices) so far
5
Stumbled into this place while coffee hunting with my barista partner. We were suppose to visit highlander coffee initially but this place has much better food menu so decided to give it a go. We ordered a prosciutto benedict and beetroot salad. Both was delicious. Portion was generous too so we both really enjoyed the meal. coffee was good and citrusy. one of the better ones I've tasted.
4
2 things that you should order: the Magic coffee and the waffle (choose with Vanilla Ice cream + fresh fruit). The coffee was excellent, while the waffle texture is just nice, and the portion is decent enough for sharing. For side dish/snacks, I recommend the truffle or spam fries. Another plus point is the refillable water
4
This low-key laid-back restaurant is locally owned and attracts mostly young Singaporean professionals. Laptops are not compulsory but fit in well. All-day breakfast comes highly recommended. In the evenings there is a short menu of simple, mostly Western, dishes. Truffled pasta in a cream sauce with spicy pork sausage went down very well indeed. The paintings on the walls are for sale - at suprisingly high prices
4
As something of a coffee snob I had been referred to this place for its fine coffee. The coffee was fantastic and I loved the very Asian approach to very accurately weighing the ground beans and then weighing the tamping pressure.This was no hipster barista flair, it was engineered perfection. Tasted great too.I tried to make a change to the Eggs Benedict (which are their own version thereof) to fit around my own tastes. Initially the waitress said the chef wouldn't do it - a comment which I seldom hear and which annoys me immensely, however after checking she said it was fine. So this isn't a criticism, just a heads-up to restaurants that can be a bit too precious about the menu.Food was indeed tasty and I'd happily go back for breakfast
4
Hats off to the ground crew who are well staffed and keeping those orders well managed inspite of a full house. Fantastic coffee too. Ice cream on them waffles are too sweet though but great variety on the breakfast menu - try the amazing house baked salmon with poached eggs
4
Ok I find this place a mixed bag.. Sometimes great, sometimes pretty over -rated.Today it was simple. Great service, friendly staff and a coffee that was pretty much perfect. They've dropped the price of their coffee a tiny bit (though highlander is cheaper) and they all roast some great single origin beans . If you haven't bean, Try it. Not amazing all the time, but if you like the ang mo style of cafes - check it out
5
We are very fussy coffee drinkers who were relieved to find great coffee during our holiday. The kids approved of the cake selection also and the waffles and the truffle fries! Coffee culture is alive and well in Singapore. Highly recommended.
4
I was there with a friend for brunch. Great armosphere! Homemade (big!) waffle with yoghurt and fresh fruit was delicious. We also liked the coffee (we ordered cappuccino & flat white) very much. Special thanks to the attentive and natural service!
4
They serve good coffee, all day breakfast, waffles and dinner (only after 5pm). The cappuccino and iced mocha are good. Breakfast and waffles are quite good especially egg Benedict with Parma ham and waffles with vanilla.Good to hang out with friends. The stools are not comfortable to sit on after a while
3
The name butter+milk+waffles combines 3 of my favorite things so we got the Buttermilk Waffles with Strawberry Maceration & Ice Cream $13.9. Maybe my expectation was too high after reading the raving reviews about the waffles online. Stingy portion of strawberries and normal tasting waffles.More thoughts and photos at http://goingmerrily.blogspot.sg/2014/10/strangers-reunion.htm
4
Crowded, noisy and cramped but light crispy waffles that pair perfectly with the fine selection of tea varieties - Called Merlot, Sauvignon etc - served in glass tea pots and kept warm with a tea light. The avocado focacia with smoked salmon and truffled sweet potato fries were great.
3
Although the shop has expanded to twice its size, unfortunately the offerings and value of both the food and ambience has taken a drastic downturn. If not for the impressionable young well heeled crowd, whose tastes are often few steps behind the other rich boys and princesses in the region and obviously taken in by the mostly buffy or cute male service crew, the location is not really that in and sustainable. The recommended new cake Chocohazo or something like that... the lighting is very dim so everyone and every dish can look beautiful is ordinary run of the mill factory stuff. The friend had their mix berry yoghurt and there was no exclamation at all, even though the setting was struck at first. The place had started out with the barista owner offering quite aromatic coffee. That evening, no even the slightest hint of caffeine was in the air

It was my girlfriend's birthday and she was craving for waffles after our dinner. Googled and found this Stranger's Reunion, drove there and saw that it was not a very big place. There was only one big table left for the 4 of us that Sunday night.We didn't know what to order as it was our first time there so we followed our guts. Trust me, THOSE WERE SOME OF THE BEST DECISIONS WE'VE EVER MADE IN OUR LIVES(okay, maybe I'm just exaggerating but really, the waffles were AMAZING!)Ordered the buttermilk waffles with strawberries and it was so yummy! You could really taste the freshness of the strawberry and the ice cream was not too sweet. Trust me when I say that because I am one of those people who don't really fancy deserts. Everyone had their drinks served except me. Had to wait for quite sometime. Note that it was not a bad thing because I actually forgot that I ordered that V60 coffee. If you think Starbucks know their coffee, you have yet to try Stranger's Reunion. The V60 is a method of brewing and filtering the coffee to perfection. Upon receiving my beautiful fresh, filtered coffee, I was advised to drink slowly and savor it as much as I could. The taste was amazing! As the temperature dropped, the taste of it changes. How cool is that?!This is hands down the best waffles I've ever had in my life, and I'm not even kidding about it. It was not, and can never be a regret choosing Stranger's Reunion. So far we've already recommended this place to our friends and hopefully the will experience the beauty of waffles and coffee here in the future.P.S: Thank you Stranger's Reunion for the wonderful service and making me FINALLY like waffles. LOL
5
Excellent coffee (they are serious about it and really know their stuff here) and a wonderful breakfast. Good choice and variety of yummy dishes to choose from. All beautifully cooked and presented. Very hip and modern cafe that is comfy too (love the cushions on the benches). Very helpful and friendly staff. Can't wait to return.

Tried this out over the weekend after reading some reviews.We are rating this place good for ambience but poor for food quality, so I would say it isn't true on its tagline " lets make love, coffee and magic". It has a nice environment and vibe, and the place seems very crowded. Service staff seems friendly as well. However if you are going for quality comfort food, you wouldn't get your palates satisfied here. Its not exceptionally bad, its just not worth the amount you pay for. There are plenty of other cafes that can offer much better presentation and value for your cent. Presentation and Quality of food-- Needs serious work.Our eggs Benedict came with two piece of small dry bread, with the smoked salmon and sauce all distinctly separated from each other. The greens did not have any seasoning/dressing at all, so they look very much like some green leaves scattered at a corner of the plate. The whole impression of this dish reminds me of what something where the various ingredients has been haphazardly whipped out from the fridge and simply placed onto a plate, and served. Needless to say-- the tastes are as segregated as its appearance. Each of the item on the dish taste like separate ingredients-- yet to be made into a proper dish. It has a creamy sour sauce at one side of the plate, a pair of eggs Benedict with sweet dressing on top in the middle, a side salad without any dressing on one end , and a lump of smoked salmon on the other. Not the best brunch I had expected from a cafe...After this not-too-delightful experience I've decided to check with some of my other friends who has been there, they too have mentioned that their standards have dipped substantially since their initial opening.So not recommended for now, unless they've decided to re-concoct their stroke of "magic
3
I actually liked their squid ink waffle with smoked salmon, poached egg drizzled with hollandaise sauce $18.90. My company liked their spam fries and we enjoyed sharing their berries dessert waffle with vanilla ice cream ($18.90 i think). Coffee was good but their cup of 'magic' was nothing more than a latte.Service was slow. We waited for more than 30mins before our main course was served. Otherwise, the cafe's cosy casual and stylish ambience was an attraction point
3
I am from Hong Kong. Nice environment, food is fair, neither especially good nor bad. Still worth a try.
3
Went for lunch, recommended by the locals. Crowded during lunch hours, although not serving 'real lunch'
Mainly finger food, salads, sandwiches, waffles; Latte was decent.
Ambiance and service was not bad.
Food was pricey.
2
Seating on small stools uncomfortable. Very crowded when we went.
Limited menu if you don't like eggs.
Coffee sour.
Not a pleasant experience.
3
Heard a lot about this cafe and therefore I expect a lot from them. however, i was disappointed when i visited them. the service and atmosphere were ok but the food was average.
4
We went with a group of friends on a Saturday & enjoyed ourselves. Sandwiches were nice but coffee - not too good! Anyway, we had a fun time. Portions were , however, a little small.
3
Ordered 1 waffle, 1 truffle fries, 1 portobello mushrooms. The waffles is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Love it ! Mushrooms taste great as well but just find that the serving was too big. My husband, my son and i were struggling to finish the above items ordered..
5
This was on my TO DO list when in Singapore and I was not disappointed, Though it might be a touch hard to find (if you are not a local) it was worth the trip.I had the waffles with greek yogurt and fruits and a Piccolo Latte, and couldn't have been happier.Coffee was great, and service was very friendly. The manager/owner? had a chat with me and talked a bit about the coffee and the blends and such, and seemed very knowledgeable and passionate. All in all, very happy I visited. Will for sure go back next trip to Singapore.Keep up the good work
2
A Singaporean friend introduced me to this place a year or so ago when it was in a tiny shop space. It was good then. Since moving into the next door space, the menu selection has become more restricted and the quality has become poorer. The coffee has become more sour so not a pleasure to drink anymore. The service has become indifferent to the point of being rude. This is sad as the place was a good place to go for a coffee brea
4
We went on Sunday at around 1pm. It was full and we waited for 10/15mn. But they have seats and fan outside. We were four, so we ordered different dishes. Crepe with salmon, eggs with ham, spinach salad....and of course different waffles. If it was not generous (except waffles), it was tasty.Service was efficient and mostly gentle. The coffee and latte were perfect. We will come bac
2
A big space and plenty of hands on deck, however at Strangers Reunion your treated as a stranger; there is a lack of service, a lack of smiles. The coffee was disappointing; watery and a little bitter for the espresso and much too milky and lacking flavor for the 'magic' (it's not). We didn't eat but the food looked to be the standard cafe fare, and none too exciting at that, especially considering the prices. For great coffee head just a few shops down to Highlander Coffee - which has been around a while and roasts the best coffee in Singapore, without the snobbish attitude that seems to be springing up at cafes recently
4
Not easy to find but well worth the effort... If only Singapore had more cafes like this. A great little cafe with character that serves first class coffee...
4
As a coffee maniac, it is a daily task to dig out cool cafe with nice coffee. ;) This lovely place, near outram park mrt, offers a tasteful atmosphere with pretty decent coffee. A very good place to see and to be seen. Their super accommodating services impressed me the most.
3
Two of us went on a Sunday afternoon to find the place packed. Most of the bigger tables (suitable for 3-4+) people are nice, but they were all taken, forcing us to pick a table from the cramped up two-sitters. They really are too close together, almost feeling like you're sharing the table next to you. It's hard to chill and relax when the couple next to you is discussing all sorts of personal matters which you can't block out because they're just too close.Anyway, the food. Since Stranger's Reunion is famous for their coffee we ordered a flat white and an affogato. Both were excellent. For food we ordered the banana-date bread and eggs florentine. The banana-date bread is excellent value, very tasty and even hard to finish by yourself. The eggs florentine, while very tasty, were somewhat of a disappointment. The eggs were poached well (somewhat of a rarity in Singapore) and the Hollandaise sauce had just the right acidity. The ciabatta bread unfortunately was already somewhat soggy by the time it arrived. There were about 5/6 leaves of spinach hidden underneath the eggs and salmon, without exaggeration. The salmon was fantastic, but that's not supposed to be on a florentine. Spinach is. We ordered this for a vegetarian for that very reason (I took the salmon), so with hardly any spinach there it's natural she was quite disappointed.For a $50 bill we expected more from the food. The coffee really is fantastic (and what they are famous for after all), but the place is too cramped and crowded to enjoy it in a relaxed setting. 3.5/5
4
Picked out stranger's reunion from a list of other reputable cafes to visit on my recent trip to Singapore. I absolutely had no regrets! The buttermilk waffle with maple syrup and fresh fruit looked too pretty for consumption but I'm so glad we took the plunge- it was decadent! We also had a decent meal out of their ham and goats cheese omelette, baked eggs in sheeshuka and truffle fries. They also have a wide selection of coffees, and I found the magic coffee aromatic and strong-bodied, if not a little bitter requiring that little bit of sugar. Although the weekend brunch crowd often warrants a waiting time for a table, it is one cafe I wouldn't mind waiting it out to enjoy good coffee and a solid meal
4
Been there twice- once when they started & it was still quiet but service was good & so was the food! Just recently again. I nearly missed it as they seem to have expanded & there are more customers. It's inevitable when food is good & coffee is great
4
I went on a Saturday in a group of 7. I had a nice coke float and the soft shell crab burger which tasted great. A couple of my friends had the Baked Eggs in Shakshuka which tasted great similar to Wild Honey's Tunisian. We shared the truffle fries that wasn't baked/deep fried in truffle oil (it has a dish of truffle oil for dipping). They have a coffee named "Magic" which tasted quite interesting as well. As it was rather crowded, we didn't manage to do a lot of chit-chatting in the cafÃ©. The space rather crowded and small. But it is a nice concept with fusion of old furniture into modern space. I would recommend folks to head to the restaurant on weekdays when it is not so crowded
5
A Singapore friend took me here to unwind from a busy day in the city. This place is a true hidden gem with lots of character. Staff are friendly and coffee is brewed perfectly (I would say the best in Singapore). I would say the items on the menu are also decent. Lots of different seating options as well, highly recommend
5
The cafes inviting exterior enticed us in. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. We had 2 huge backpacks with us and they quickly found somewhere to store them. I had a coffee, whilst my other half had a coke float. The bill came to roughly $12. Both drinks were lovely. There was a range of books out to read, keeping us entertained for nearing an hour. Great place to meet with friends
5
Stranger's reunion is one of the cafe in Singapore serving great coffee. It serves decent basic cafe offerings, like cakes, sandwiches and pies. I got to know this place after a recent local newspaper report. The barista had won various accolades in various competitions. A cafe not to be miss by coffee lovers
4
I had 2 lattes and an eggs benedict. The latte art was beautiful but it tasted pretty weak and ordinary - no punch. The pouched eggs looked very much like how i would have made it - which arent good at all - seemed to have retained the water it was cooked in. The side salad had some leaves that were stale. the service was great becos when i ordered a sandwich for take away and they asked if we preferred to have it made right before we lef
