My gosh! The pork knuckle was to die for and perfectly paired with their craft beer or cider. The price was very reasonable for the serving size and quality. It was hawker style environment but such a great experience.

We visited this Stew Kuche at about noon and ordered for half portion of Pork Knuckle.I specifically requested that we be served freshly made knuckle.The skin on the knuckle was really crispy and delicious. The meat was soft, succulent and tender. The mashed potatoes were near perfect. Perhaps a little more gravy (sauce) may have added further flavour & value to the dish. Half portion was enough as a "starter" for 3 of us !We took a taxi to this restaurant

Ordered the platter which should have had sauerkraut and pork loin but was instead replaced with a cold Asian pickle (which was weird) and hash browns! With no warning so it was like a German-Malay-British fry up strange concoction! The pork knuckle was quite nice and had no issues with the sausages. The beer was the best part of the meal with $10net pints and lots of choice, upset that they refused to give us a glass of tap water though with a small bottled water costing $4!!! I might return for a pint but would probably not eat here again

This place is as German as my Lederhosen from Aliexpress. The Roesti (not German in the first place) had the texture of badly mushed potato mush. The pork knuckle had a foul smell to it. The sausages were served on a slice of processed cheese. Half the menu not available. Beer was sour, no gas - sitting in the heat for too long.Service - everything can not. Singaporean owner, Indian and Chinese service and kitchen personnel. Why open a "German" restaurant? Why not stick with something you know and can manage? Sorry but this is a very sad state of affairs, certainly will never be back

The brilliant thing about this place is that you can get many stalls selling angmoh food from ONE coffeeshop. And the angmoh food sold here is not your generic chicken cutlet with fried rice stall.Pork Knuckle was crispy and meaty too. Good price for the taste. We got the platter with the sausages and the platter was good. With cheesy sausages and mash and hash browns. Excellent platter to share with the group of friends.The mussels were ok only as they don't sell the premium black mussels, instead they use our local mussels which is not as sweet.The fans work well but I would still like to enjoy my food without the sticky feeling

It is located in the coffeeshop at Alexandra Village. Serves grilled meat such as pork, lamb, chicken, as well as their signature pork knuckle and stews. Had the mixed grill which comes with grilled chicken, pork and lamb with mashed potato and some greens. Could do with more veggies to be honest but the meats are the highlight. All for S$18 bucks, definitely worth it

The pork knuckle here is crispy and goes very well with the local achar. Beer here is decently priced too. Its quite popular here on weekends so do come early. There is no air con as it is in the local coffee shop style but the fans are surprisingly cooling. Really like the ambience here

 after a good meal a few weeks ago we came back and had some beers and ordered a pretzel. It was delivered microwaved and chewy not at all nice and crispy like the real pretzel. I hope you guys work on quality as I really like your concept.

3 of us visited the place, we ordered 1 full portion of the pork knuckle, 6pcs of chicken wings, 1 sweet potato and 3 glasses of beer. All of the food was exceeding my expectation, they were all great, beer selection is quite satisfying.Location wise is not the easiest to reach, not accessible through MRT. Its around 5 - 10mins walk from IKEA. If you are traveling from orchard, you can just take bus #123 from orchard blvrd and it might take around 20mins ride, get off at the bus stop after you can see IKEA

We ordered half portion which cost us $17.65 inclusive of GST to share between both of us. We ordered 1 mug of the beer which was good, so in the end we consumed 3 between us. The pork knuckle was crisp but yet not crispy enough to hear the crackling. It was rather oily and I deemed it would be that the knuckle was prepared well ahead of time in anticipation of crowd, and when it cool down, you can taste the oil. The meat was soft, and sort of melted into your mouth, which was enjoyable. Overall it was good for that price and portion, would and can be better. Will definitely go back again. As for the service, nothing to comment as the setup is a coffeeshop environment, so I am not expecting to have wait staff. It is rather straight forward, get a table, read the menu, walk to the cashier, place order and pay. Obtained a receipt and collect your own utensil and walk back to wait for the buzzer or they will deliver. When you finish, just walk away. Nothing is free so I guess if we want service we have to pay. But this works well for me - affordable
