Read reviews about this place and my best friend loves it.
Finally got to try it myself, it is interestingly good it's like having a huge maki.
However, wish the shop is a little neater. Just my two cents. ;)

There really doesn't seem to be much of the good stuff compared to a similar value of sushi, while it's nowhere near as big as a mexican burrito. The "innovative" cardboard containers need to be ripped open to access, so paper would have been better.

I did not eat at the one in town but at the airport. EXCELLANT!!! What a great surprise to have great sushi in an airport. Service was super and even did a special request. Well worth the stop.

Food was good but communication was a problem. They were very slow to clear tables if dining in but you can get take away.

Ordered rising sun for lunch. it has a bit of salmon and crab. Overall i'm ok with it... taste, portion, sauces, nothing really special

Ordered quite a few times during rainy day and it is a good choice, despite slightly expensive. we always get the full roll as half roll seems not filling.SIGNATURE FRIED BACK ROLL - a bit oily but tastySALMON RUMBA, RISING SUN, FLAMING DRAGON all tasted good

We tried out the Sushi Burrito concept kiosk at Changi airport on our way out of town, and we found pretty good value for the money (three 1/2 burritos filled us up) and we bought beer from a bar to have with them. The combinations are really interesting: We tried the Geisha Dance (eel/pickled cabbage) and the Flaming Dragon (spicy sashimi tuna plus accoutrements) and a chicken version. A tasty and different treat before the onslaught of airline economy food to come..

It's an ingenious idea! As the name implies it's a sushi roll served like a burrito! There are many choices but my personal favorite is the salmon with crab meat. Best of both worlds! Enjoy your favorite sushi without having to navigate chopsticks! It's filling and affordable. Definitely worth trying!Note: it's located at Changi Airport Terminal 1 near transfer desk

The ladies at Sushi Burrito in Changi Airport were so lovely and happily made us a sushi burrito to order to cater for our weird dietary requirements! They were able to tell us exactly what was used in each ingredient so we could decide what to add and what to leave out.Great service - thanks Sushi Burrito

Sushi burrito in Changi airport had great food. The veggie sushi burrito was plenty filling and it cost about $11 SGD. I think the half is good but if you're super hungry then go for the full size. I was stuffed.

Ordered the Rising Sun and it's my fave among the other options! :)
used my entertainer 1 for 1 for a great deal! ;)

I love the combination of flavours as well as the size of the roll... provides tasty yet (relatively!) healthy alternatives to the burgers in the area. Will definitely be eating from here again.

I had It in a box. I had the Rising Sun. I loved the mix of flavors.
Very unique way to eat Sushi. Very good taste.

I went here during my lunch at break at work. Have to say that I was happy with my visit - the interior is welcoming and neat while the staff are very friendly and patient. I had a half of the Geisha Dance ($7.50) and really liked it. Be warned, the food here is pretty delicious but will definitely burn a hole in your pocket (as quality sushi and Singapore expenses do anyway). I recommend this place, definitely worth a visit at least once

The Good:- a half roll is good for a small eater like me-many options, even vegetarian and rice-less ones available-convenient concept-it's on The Entertainer so i got to enjoy a 1-for-1 dealThe Not-so-good:-7SGD for a meal (regular price) is quite expensive. it goes higher if you're getting a full roll or a box-visited thrice so far, once at the changi airport outlet and twice at the tras street outlet. inconsistent wrapping skills both times at tras, once the whole burrito just opened up because it wasn't wrapped tight enough.-think the tras outlet could do with better ventilation because i left the place reeking of oil thanks to its fried items.-wasabi provided could be of better quality, taste wasn't strong at all. for half a roll i used a full tablespoon's worth

The name says it all, it's essentially sushi, burrito size. My salmon rumba burrito was wrapped in nori but a colleague's burrito had it's outer layer (presumably tortilla) deep fried. Because of the rice, the burritos are pretty filling. Taste-wise, they are not bad. I guess I would say they taste "healthy"? It's mostly one protein and an assortment of veges and pickles in the middle of the burrito. Good for lunch but wouldn't do it for me if it's dinner

I was skeptical at first and even a bit turned off by the marriage of such different cuisines as Mexican and Japanese! How could I imagine mixing grits and porridge in one bowl? But, here I am at the Singapore airport with little chance of finding a decent sit down restaurant, so why not try it. It's not going to kill me! So, I ordered a geisha dance sandwich (a burrito), which is unagi (a fresh water eel) wrapped in a flour tortilla which was not at all bad. It was mildly spiced, moist, and had a decent taste. I was full, but decided I would much rather enjoy the two cuisines separately to be able to properly enjoy their different flavors and textures

Chanced upon this place at Tanjong Pagar and was pretty spoilt for choices from their menu selections. The potato salad is quite salty but still pretty good, while the sushi burrito (salmon & crabmeat) that I had was tasty. The full roll is good to share among two persons. Would love to return again to try other flavours from the menu.P.S. I bit into a small piece of plastic in the burrito. Informed the staff about it and she immediately wrapped a new burrito for me after apologising. Appreciated the response though I hope that they would be more careful about food handling in the future

Who doesn't like a good Mashup. Two great cuisines. Mexican style with Japanese ingredients, the concept is amazing. After a short metro ride and 300m walk from the station we made it to Sushi Burrito. I was so hungry that I quickly ordered a beer and a fried back roll. This was a roll filled with crab meat, tamango, lettuce, cucumber, and avocado. I was really happy with my order. I'd definitely come again

Wanted a light bite and noticed that they were listed on Entertainer Singapore app! Interesting flavours and definitely worth the try!

Slow service, and the burrito's are hard too eat. Confusing menu options. The taste of the burrito was good, but not special.
4
This was my 2nd visit. Really like the sushi roll. It is yummy. Prices are a bit expensive but I feel is value for money. The presentation was great but can be quite messy
5
Tried this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Very fresh and quality ingredients and tasty! It is definitely something new and highly recommended.

I went there when I just got off a plane from saigon. It was located in 100am mall. The food there was very nice. They made sushi rolls that look like a burrito, meaning they put a lot of ingredients of sushi like shrimp, salmon, cucumber, carrots and even salad and some other vegetables in there and they wrapped it all together, it was about 7cm in diameters, so it is quite large. You can order the whole roll (about 20cm length) or just half of it. Also, there's a box option for you if you don't want to have the roll, cause it's quite messy after you have a few bites. On top of that, the food is not half bad, and there's free wifi too

o Very creative!o New style of eating sushi.o Worth a try. x Does not taste as rich as the conventional sushi.x Slightly overpriced. x Not filling at all. i. I had a lunch set of crabby crunch with a chawanmushi and miso soup for 14.50SGD. Still hungry..

I was in the mall and wanted a light bite to go when I spied this little place with the intriguing name. I had no idea what the food was all about and was not much wiser after the staff explained though there is a mockup model to look at!I plumped for a crunchy crab sushi burrito in a seaweed wrap with rice and veg. I loved the concept and the taste was overall good but the crunchy crab filling was distinctly odd to my taste. It was some deep fried concoction and the oil it was fried in left a bad after taste. If I lived there, I would actually go back and try another option though as I think maybe I just made a bad choice of filling. Not sure I would want to eat in as the tables are very 'cosy'. I think this is definitely more sushi than burrito ...

After being interested in the concept of Mexican-Japanese, I tried Sushi Burrito for a quick lunch located at Tanjong Pagar in the ground floor of the 100AM Building. I ordered the Skinny Sumo option as recommended by the Cashier because it was a no rice option. As hungry as I was and willing to try this meal, I suffered through what was perhaps one of the most tasteless and un-enjoyable meals I have had. There was a complete lack of taste and was filled with lettuce and offered the tiniest portion of meat. For the price paid as well ($12), it was a total disappointment. After complaining to the manager / owner afterwards, he made the amateur mistake of F&B service recovery, and totally dismissed and ignored my dissatisfaction and abruptly ended our conversation without any hint at redeeming the negative experience. This is one fusion restaurant that instead of mixing Mexican with Japanese cuisine, has fused together lack of value with poor service

The 'burritos' here make for a good, healthy lunch in the CBD. The plus point is the times that I went during lunch hour, there wasn't a long queue so my orders came quickly. The quality of sashimi is alright, and quite generous. Lots of veggies and nice sauces to accompany the dishes. Probably the only thing is it's a little steep in terms of price

This small cafe is tucked at the corner of the 100AM Shopping Mall and is pretty easy easy to find (it's opposite Starbucks), and dishes out handroll-liked/Burrito-styled sushi. Not many patrons about at the time we went by just after lunch hour. Our order of the 'Yummy Belly' was taken, and the food prepared in about 5 minutes, alongside a complementary cup of miso soup as this was our first visit. The full-length Yummy Belly is stuffed with sliced beef, veggies and a bit of dressing, sliced down the middle and served as two half-rolls. Looked quite pleasing, tasted pretty good too. We both thought thought though that it was priced a little too high for the type of fare and its setting. So - loved the food, didn't like the price as much
