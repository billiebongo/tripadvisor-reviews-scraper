Unlike the bak kut teh in Malaysia, the Song Fa‚Äôs bak kut teh tastes less Chinese herbs but more pepper in the soup. The pork rib is so tender and soup is clear with strong pepper. Price is reasonable too.

I went there for lunch around 3pm and there was no queue.
Food were great, staffs were attentive and friendly.
Will return for future dining üëçüëç

One of the best bak kut teh I've ever had!! They were very generous with the refills. I must've had 3 - 4 servings! Can't wait to go back for more.

Pricing of the food here is reasonable, staff are very attentive, always topping up the soup for the Bak Kut Teh for us. not my first visit here and definitely not my last.
Will be back soon !

Been in the Orchard Road to shopping and heard of this famous place. The queue is really long but worth waiting. The food is amazing especially the bak kut teh which is really tender and flavored. A negative point is that it's quite slow and not very good for the solo customer

If you wonder why the bak kut teh here tastes different, it is because it's the Teochew version i.e. is more peppery and garlicky. The soup is not as strong as the one from Klang. Which is tastier? It all is an acquired taste.I ordered pork stomach, daugan and rice porridge and had warm sweet chestnut drink. After missing bak kut teh for months, I enjoyed the meal. The service was friendly, soup was topped up without asking and I didn't feel rushed although the restaurant was full.

Being in Orchard and raining, there is nothing better than a bowl of soup and rice to finish off the day! What a bonus this was to come across this restaurant tucked away in the back of The Centrepoint in Orchard.Bak Kut Teh is always a treat for us, this peppery version was perfect for a rainy day, where it will soothe the aches from the shopping ad warm you up from inside out from the damp of the rain. To accompany the Bak Kut Teh, we had the pig's stomach (4/5) and pig's liver (4/5), Kai Lan (4/5) You Tiau (2/5), Braised Peanuts (3/5) Mee Sua soup (4/5) and bowls of rice.The restaurants service is 3/5 where the soup will all come out first and the vegetables and condiments a little later. You can imagine what we had to endure while waiting for the rice before we could stuck tucking into the food... My observations was the service is quite erratic and is expected dependent on the traffic in the kitchen. A gentle query with the waiter/waitress will have your missing dishes delivered.Overall, this is a great place for an impromptu experience of a 'local' cuisine. The setting is great and ultimately an excellent value for money

Bak Kut Teh, a traditional Singaporean Chinese cuisine that has been popular with the locals for many decades. Transformed from old shop lot in the street of Singapore into a modern eatery place inside a shopping mall; and it does not loose the original taste but instead offers more choices. Good value good food. Visitors to Singapore, it is a must try cuisine

I was with my friends at restaurant yesterday. We had to queue up to go in. However it was only for a short while and during that time we whiled it away by placing our orders for dinner. The restaurant was crowded. Aesthetics wise it is a simple middle-ranged restaurant.We ordered a bowl of premium ribs soup, the soup is refillable, braised intestines with beancurd sheets, a bowl of loin meat soup which was very tender, a little too tender for me, salted moi choy, a tad too greasy for my taste, braised chicken feet and vegetables. The soup was pepperish and very tasty, and so was the ribs. The chicken feet was tender and nice too.The waiters were polite and attentive. To sum it all, the experience was quite enjoyable. The next time I am there I will try out the meesuah instead of the rice cause it looked rather tasty

One of the best bak kut teh in town. Soup is clear and not spicy (pepper) so your kids can enjoy it too

Pork Pork Soup is pretty tasty and Braised Pork Belly is delicious with good prices.
The above food will be more delicious accompanied by the menu of Kai Lan vegetables and fried cakue and eaten with rice.
5
Song Fa is a sure value great dishes and good value for money
This new outlet is tuck in the back of the mall on one level up from ground floor.
Will try again soon!

This is the right place when you want to eat Bak kut. They have good taste and service. Price also reasonable.

Fast service, delicious meal, and good value for money. There may be a queue at times, but is fast-moving and every time I dine, is always a great dining experience in service and total food satisfaction.

The price of each dish, and the portion when it came to the table, I have to say I was a bit surprised of the amount of food in front of me. It will be a bit too much if you are a single girl. But we went in group, and we finished every dish. Yummy! ( their home made drinks is worthy to try

I was craving for Bak Kut Teh few days back while I was in Centrepoint Orchard road. I started goggle the nearest stall near me and I found it on 2nd level. Since I am alone I only ordered the regular pork rib soup + the pickle vegetable and a small bowl of rice. The taste was fantastic and it reminds me of that childhood memories...and As I observed the elderly staffs are very high in spirit and cheerful...wow I really enjoy my lunch with these lovely veterans around :) keep up that spirit folks ! The best part eating here is that you can keep on refill the soup without any cost. And of course the fresh cut red chillies and the sweet dark soy sauce couldn't be a missed...

I have been a regular customer for Song Fa Bakut Teh since they only have shops in Clarke Quay, and this newly open at Centrepoint is more convenient for me in terms of location. The service is excellent (be prepared for waiting time during dinner/lunch time) however they are fast and efficient. The pork ribs soup (white pepper based) is a MUST, it comes with a relatively little soup but not to worries as it is FREE to refill the soup... In terms of price, some said it's overpriced, but come on we receive great service and nice air-conditioned restaurant with waiters serving you, definitely worth every dollars. Large bowl of Prime Pork Ribs Soup around $9/- Average damage for two is around $25-30 They do charge GST and service charge 1%, yes it is 1% unlike most restaurant in SG that charge 10%. With such a great service we had and they charge a nominal 1% I feel it is totally acceptable. Rather than other restaurant that charge you 10% with bad service... Anyway, it's totally recommended for whoever want to try Authentic SIngapore Bakut Te

Comfy aircon setting, more pro-active refilling of soups, queues are shorter than at the New Bridge Road locations, parking is easier - my vote is for this new outlet! The soup is still very yummy. In addition to different types of pork ribs, they also have chicken feet, tofu skin, intestines, pig trotters, pickled vegs, etc. Prices have increased, in line with food prices at all eateries in Singapore, but still reasonable

Food: Most Bak Kut Teh are either very herbal or very peppery! This place has I believe the perfect mix/balance between the two! Bak Kut Teh to perfection! The servers are also quick to offer FREE REFILLS of this deliciously amazing soup! Service: Like all yummy Chinese style restaurants, its in a relatively small old building where seats / tables are all within close proximity of each other. Servers are friendly and considerate and do offer you the space you need to eat. Key Takeaway: Absolute MUST EAT in Singapore
