Always good for late night prata.
They have Bryani only on Friday which is a must try. Especially if you go in a group and get the Bryani on a tray and do communal eating. Very good.

We were staying with a friend in an apartment in Kembangan and one morning our host suggested we walk across the sports field at the base of his block to have breakfast at Raimah Eating House.We ordered four roti with egg and cheese and I watched fascinated as the chef needed the ball of dough, making it larger and larger as he expertly flipped it into the air and back down on to the hot griddle.The roti was served with bowls of a curry flavored sauce into which we dipped pieces of broken off roti before popping them into our mouths.With cups of strong Singaporean coffee it was a hearty breakfast to start the day.Cost for three people was just S$12.50
