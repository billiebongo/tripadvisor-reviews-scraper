The service and foods are great! Warm welcome by the staff especially Helen Banes! Highly recommended!

Had breakfast with a friend. I chose the Healthy breakfast option which was surprisingly substantial. Not the healers plxe but it was nice and quiet as there were hardly any tour groups around which I had previously experienced.
5
Excellent buffet spread at The Dining Room! Fresh succulent oysters, sashimi and the works. Desserts were delightful as well. Definitely a place where all palates will be satisfied!
5
the oysters were fresh n big juicy, thank u chef Eric n Mr kolin for special arrangement for the birthday cake : )
2
Spread is average for the price and parking charges are exorbitant (as is the case for most 5 star hotels but most usually provide complimentary parking for diners)
4
I like the cascading waterfalls that give the overall experience an additional plus. Spread is good and service is impeccable too.
5
I had a great reunion dinner with my colleagues at the Dining room on 15th Feb 2018, the selection of the buffet is fantastic and so does the taste! In addition we were served by great staff here, such as Helen, Matthew, Letchu and Princess! Very prompt service, always with a smile and pay attention to details! Thank you guys so much for our pleasant reunion dinner

The buffet is very pricey for what you get. I suggest you order by the menu or go elsewhere.Despite paying over the top prices, they still refuse to give any WiFi to their restaurant guests, and no parking coupons.The dining room barely had any diners and now I can see why
5
Simply love the whole atmosphere. It's unlike many buffets that's noisy n cluttered, the noise volume here is really low. Likely due to the structure of the place. I am not an oyster fan, but my friend who is one, says, was one of the best oysters eaten here, freshly opened, very fresh, plump n juicy. I love their roast beef, not too raw, yet very tender, juicy and well flavored. Their hot dishes are delectable too. Oh, and their cakes and Pana cotta, really good. The manager, Mr Kolin, was very friendly n attentive to all the arrangements too. His team really assisted him well, all very friendly and fast in their service. Was a great place to go.

We visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration. The ambiance was peaceful and the waterfalls in the background was ideal for photo-taking. The oysters were fresh and creamy and the beef was excellent. Service was good. The team was friendly and helpful. Credit must go to chef Eric and restaurant manager Kolin. Thank you for making our birthday celebration a pleasant experience
1
Unbelievable and embarrassingly poor quality Buffet that I would not recommend anyone to go. It is shameful the Sheraton can condone this.
3
Ambiance is good. Service is great but food selection is rather limited. Range of seafood is rather disappointing.
4
The buffet spread is not considered extensive but most of the dishes were of high quality, especially the double-boiled chicken soup, the teriyaki salmon, sashimi and a number of the desserts. The one-for-one UOB promotion makes it value for money!
5
We enjoyed serveral great meals here. We can recommend the dining room. We will definitely return here.
5
good compliment to fine chinese and italian restaurants at Sheraton Towers hotel. wide choice of food
4
I stayed here for 35 nights but as a Brit found it too expensive to eat here regularly. Helpful and friendly staff, but limited choice for a vegetarian.
5
i frequent The Dinning Room regularly for breakfast. The service staff here are excellent and they remembered the names of regular and also their preference for drinks (such as coffee black or green tea) and also the favorite seating.The executive sous chef Aswad is also very accommodating and prepare the food to my preference such as the excellent carrot cake in black and white style. I have never come across a hotel cafe to do this for you. Aswad told me this the other day "it is my pleasure to customize breakfast for you. when our guest is happy with the breakfast, they have a good day to start with.

We dined at The Dining Room on 09/10 to celebrate birthday. They have wide selection of delicious food, fresh seafoods, dessert & fruits. We really enjoyed the black pepper crabs, sashimi, oysters, cool station seafood, dessert ...The restaurant has good atmosphere, cosy and the amount of open space makes it comfortable and relaxing to dine in. This restaurant is perfect for couple, family and large groups gatherings. It looks fresh & welcoming .. Of cos not forget to mention 'Artificial Waterfall', it looks natural and beautiful!We were very impressed with ERIC CHEAM, Chef Executive. He was very friendly, warm and provided excellent service to all guests. Thumbs up for his great service ! OVERALL FOOD AND DESSERT QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH ! We will share with friends and definitely come back for next visit ..
5
We went to The Dining Room for a weekday buffet lunch for 4 adults and 3 kids. It was a delectable lunch - reasonable spread and finger-licking fresh! I love the laksa, grilled lamb, sashimi, sushi, and salad especially. The kids love to make their ice cream with various toppings and lovely desserts (pistachio mousse, durian mousse). My parents felt that the lunch buffet is of TOP quality - the beef and mutton curry is soft and flavourful. Nowadays, you tend to see places offering a wide spread but at the expense of quality. The standard of service is thumbs up too! The coffee and tea at the end of the meal wrapped it up perfectly. We like the fact that it's not a big restaurant, lesser noise and we enjoyed watching the waterfalls. We will definitely visit again.

This place is by far the best dinner buffet I ever had in Singapore. The food selections are of premium quality. Their US Oysters were fat and creamy. The first bite send me off to my winter wonderland. The size of the oyster is considerably good and it's creamy succulent texture is as good as the ones I had in Hokkaido. Next is the Japanese sweet prawns. I can only find this in Japan restaurant and I was overjoy that this restaurant serves my favourite dish.Not only that, they have very good balance of food selections in terms of taste to go along with the various buffet dishes. Their pepper crabs and chilli crabs are fresh and tasty. The crab meat is full. The durian pudding also have a twist to it by adding the crumbs and preserving the strong flavour of durian without being too sweet. Beef, Lamb and Chicken spreads were juicy and delicious. We were also amazed with the assorted cracker selections they have at the counter. The desserts were just right..Thanks to the kitchen team, the Chef the staff and the management who sourced for the good items. They were excellent. We will come again.
3
Just a very average buffet. The station where prawn noodle and roast Lamb counter are situated is not very accessible to patron. The rest is normal as what hotel should be.
3
food variety was ok for the promotion on 1-1 offer for Maybank card. They able provide complimentary cake for birthday too. Thank you!
5
Nice buffet with decent spread. I like the strawberry ice cream,
I can taste the natural fruit in it.
Will come back again for the buffet.
2
Some of the favorite dishes hi-lighted by the previous reviews are no more there! Quite disappointed in fact. But the ambient of the restaurant is good.
3
Should have more choices as quite limited of food for lunch .example for sushi, cooked food, ice cream, etc
5
Apart from the nice ambience, most importantly is the service provided by Ms Helen Banes Paraico. Helen is always cheerful and went extra miles to make sure my guests are comfortable throughout the meal. My guests enjoyed the evening very much and we will be back soon. Thank you Helen

My family and I celebrated a birthday at The Dining Room on Saturday 19 August. We booked a table at 7pm. The seafood on ice was a sumptuous spread of snow crab, mussels, clams, spanner crab and tiger prawn, all of which were fresh. Oysters were large, succulent and plump. The tuna and salmon sashimi were very tasty too. They also served salted egg yolk crab, oat fried chicken, roast leg of lamb, stewed mixed vegetables (chap chye), stewed veal slices with purple cabbage and onions, and durian crumble. There was a limited but acceptable range of desserts and cheeses; the most unusual was the salted egg yolk fondue which I was reluctant to try but my parents thought it was delicious. The service by a Myanmese, Filipino and Indian staff were attentive and friendly. There was a 20% discount for Maybank card. Best of All, we could enjoy relaxing live piano music from the lounge next door and see the waterfall feature right outside from the full glass windows of the restaurant. I had a birthday cake which was a nice gesture by the restaurant. A memorable experience.
5
Had a family dinner at the Sheraton Hotel Singapore ; The Dining Room today and was impressed with the quality spread of food ;- fresh and delicious. The experience was made complete by the attentive service of the waiters Aung and Letchu. Thank you Aung and Letchu for making a great dining experience for the family on this special day

Recently tried breakfast (2x) and dinner (1x) here with my family. Dinner was above average. The seafood was very fresh with special mention going to the prawns and the salmon. Variety was not a lot but enough to be satisfying. Helps that there was a 1-for-1 promotion that brought the cost of the meal down by 50%. Staff was attentive and friendly although not very familiar with promo details. Still, this got sorted out during payment and everything was fine,Breakfast was a bit of a mess due to the crowds. The condensation (water) dripping from the air-con could be observed and on the second day, I overheard another guest making a feedback on the dripping water and the staff replied as a matter of fact that it is just condensation. If my experience with the Dining Room is based solely on this, I would have rated it poorly for the discomfort of having water dripping onto your table / chair / food as well as the indifference the staff showed when a feedback was made. As no water dripped onto my food (that I observed) on both mornings, I was willing to be less critical but the chair my son was in was definitely wet from the dripping water. Options wise, the breakfast was pretty basic. The staff at the eggs station was a little less professional as they made comments about other guests while preparing the food. In summary, the dinner team (and experience) was great but the breakfast crew and offerings was slightly below standards
4
Visited the dining room on a Saturday afternoon. Got to sit by the glass wall with a direct view of the pond and waterfall outside. During the visit, the spread included 2 soups: bak kut teh and cream of cauliflower. The latter was bad. They too had pasta, buttered rice, stay, meat stews, some dim sum, mantou with chili crab dip and a bunch of crackers. They had a little corner for sushi + sashimi which was great. Followed by the cold area for salads, fruits prawns, cheese etc. Lastly, the dessert section. They had 2 ice cream flavors. Vanilla and I think passion fruit. It really looked as though they tried to neaten up a half eaten tub by pressing the ice cream down, flat into the tub. However it really just looked refreezed after being semi melted. They had many little cakes which we're hard to grasp due to their cake serving tool. Maybe tongs would have been better. They too had ice jelly, some traditional warm dessert and bread pudding. Overall I think the food was pretty great. But things like the comfort and ease of the whole buffet process could definitely be improved. Most of the food were placed on some special temperature adjustable table top which could either keep the food cold or hot. That was pretty neat and I've not seen it else where yet. However, the special table leaves very little space to either put down the plate or the cover of the pot (if any), making it hard to take the food. More space would be great.

My friends and I Absolutely enjoyed the buffet lunch. The food was delicious. Will definitely go again.
4
I like the ambience of the restaurant, service was good and food selection was adequate, will definitely go back again
4
Large spread of Food for breakfast, but they should get some decent Indian Chef, since Indian food items for breakfast are horrible. Lots of indian are also staying at that Hotel
3
Good food well cooked with several choices. Unfortunately since previous stays the amount of choices particularly of the European selection seems to have gone down, the Chinese section is far better.
5
Excellent service at the Dining room ! We appreciate the fact that the service staff made an effort to prepare a complimentary birthday surprise for our friend. Great ambience for dinner gathering with friends!
5
The dining room has an excellent breakfast buffet and A La Carte lunch and dinner with a wide selection of cuisine.
2
Came for a buffet lunch based on the reputation of the hotel. The lunch spread is below average. For sashimi, they have salmon, tuna, octopus and prawn. The prawn sashimi is the saving grace but the replacement is very slow. They have 2 kinds of soup, mushroom and herbal chicken soup, nothing to shout about. There is a carving section, serving roast beef but it is tough and dry. Do avoid it. Beef rendang is acceptable but the seafood hokkien noodle is quite soggy. For the pastries, they have pourtuguese egg tart which is ok. As for the rest of the pastries, only the chocolate mousse and tiramisu cake is of standard. The staff serving us is very prompt and courteous. Dun think we will be back for a second time as there are better choices even if this is under a promo by Maybank 1-1
4
First class service with waiter asking our group of advanced elderly whether we would like warm water; the warm touch in bringing out the birthday cake (albeit a very tiny one) for our 89-year old celebrant! Positive point for elderly: need not queue as it is not too crowded. The not so positive is the long table seating arrangement -- difficult for the elderly to push back their chairs to move to the food. SGD73nett for two if you use Maybank credit card to pay for the 1-for-1 promotion is OK value in view of its location. Would have helped if 'The Dining Room' had issued parking voucher
5
almost 20 of us were at The Dining Room for buffet. The price is cheap when you have the 1 for 1 maybank promotion. The only drawback is that the setting is near to one another and it is hard to push to chair to have a walking space
4
Wonderful view of the waterfall as backdrop while you dine in a relatively less crowd and the environment was therefore quieter.Good for big family as the deal for current month is 1-for-1 with Maybank credit card, which comes up to about S$33 per adult. Thus it is still a value for money buffet with seafood, sashimi, local food, etc.Service was prompt.No complimentary parking here.I have seen some photos on other websites showing what seemed like a great variety but as what other TA members mentioned, and I agree, variety is lesser thus do lower your expectation on the spread
3
The food was ok, not much variety, not worth paying full price for the dinner buffet. Luckily we had 1 for 1 n each pax comes up to abt $35 which is ok.
5
Food could have improved a bit. Not many varieties. But good quality. Loved the chilli crab sauce and fried bun. Overall was a good lunch.
5
I have been to Sheraton towers for dining many times, the service rendered and food are still v good and I would strongly recommend this hotel as one of the hotels to go to in Singapore
3
Dinner buffet on a friday.. food variety was pretty limited for its price (62++ per pax)
Ambiance and scenery was good though.
No idea why they served lor mee, it was horrible and bland.
4
Ambience was good. Howevrr, the crayfish was not very fresh - it seemed pike they have just took itnout from the freezer and served. The oysters displayed were quite less. Nonetheless, the cooked food were really nice and there was great service.
5
We enjoyed dinner several times and the staff and food was always great, the dining room manager got to know our likes very quickly
3
I went for the buffet lunch on the Maybank 1-for-1 promotion and was very disappointed with the limited spread of the food... there isn't much variety and some of their usual dishes such as the durian penyet is missing... the only thing that was positive during the lunch was the good service provided by the service staf
3
Variety not wideFood was averageService was satisfactoryThe only thing I like was the ambienceThe only disappointmemt was that there was no chicken and my son loves chicken and the dinner was part of his birthday celebration! But I should bear full responsibility. No fault of The Dining Roo
5
Was there on 30th Dec 2016 for dinner. Love the ambience, elegance and very romantic as you step into the lobby area. From the telephone operator, the restaurant reservation staff, the kitchen staff and the servers at the dining room, maintained a very high quality and standard in their service. They greeted and served each and every guest with warmth smile and made our dining experienced pleasant and a memorable one. Kitchen staff willing to accommodate our request which was not stated in the menu. I'm unable to mention any particular staff as all of them were tremendously professional and friendly. Keep up the good work. Thank you so much
4
I was told they have half price for dinner on Wednesday lady's night. We went there and were impressed by the view outside glass wall. I can't expect more on the view. The service is among the best. The only thing is that not so many choices and seafood and steak are just average, but Chinese food tastes excellent. I really recommend this restaurant for family dining out, especially on Wednesday. Oh, their white wine is also excellent.
3
Excellent waterfall seating view and good customer service from Ms Maria. Food spread is average but I like the French loaf, pumpkin soup there.
4
Nice servicing and viewing the garden. Everything is good only the less choose food and not that fresh for oyster.
3
Working attitude are excellent . Prompt and Friendly . The dessert area is kids favourite . The foods varities could be more.
4
Waiters were polite. Food arrived quickly. Very nice view of the waterfall and garden. Great ambience with live music from the nearby lounge.
3
The coffee was weak and the Cappuccino was too diluted. Food was variable but nothing to talk about. The little breakfast in the Club Lounge is much much better. Went there once in my 10 day stay. Never went there again.
2
Buffet spread was very limited. No oysters nor cold prawn, crab etc. Sashimi wasn't fresh. Will not recommend at all.
Paid about $50 per pax for lunch after 20% discount from may bank card.
4
Came for the buffet, and I was captivated by the man-made waterfall which enhanced the dining experience. I find the buffet lacks variety on different cuisines. However, their seafood and sashimi would be what you came for. Especially the oysters, they are large and meaty. Ate half a dozen of them. The desserts are good too. Also, the staffs were friendly and provided a great service.If you are looking for a buffet with variety, you might be a tad disappointed, but the quality of the food makes up for the paucity of variety
4
With a man-made mini-waterfall just outside the dining window, you would feel like you are dining away from the city. Ambience was wonderful. Food spread on a sat evening was joy to the eye, seduction to the tongue and comfort to the belly! Wonderful experience. It would have been good if some of the staff had a better command of the english language because they had difficulty understanding what drinks we wanted to order
4
I went with a group of friends for their Wednesday dinner buffet promotion. The Dining Room is located beside the lounge and while dining, you can enjoy the wonderful live music played by the pianist at the lounge. The oyster was freshly shucked on the spot. The poached snow crab is a must try, the flesh is sweet and juicy. Also worth a mention is the dessert corner. You will not want to give the chocolate fondue and waffles a miss. Other food items includes crepes at dessert station, beef at carving station, warm entrees and soup, salad and cheese platter, maki sushi and variety of sashimi! Staff went beyond their service to help us take a group photo:) I see myself going back there:
3
I enjoyed having my brunch there cause overall the embience is good and you can sit there enjoying your food without having people rushing you for the next round of customers. I was just shocked that they did not give complimentary parking coupon and end up I had to pay $14 for the parking for the 3-hr brunch there. Selection of food mainly local cuisine.
5
Great variety and quality. Soup and salad choice is good ut the best bit is the variety of meats including lamb and beef.
4
Good quality dishes although the buffet spread was limited. Calming ambience in a waterfall backdrop. We ate dinner, it was already dim. I guess if you dine for lunch and high tea, the backdrop will be much nicer. Friendly and attentive waiters.
5
This was a reall good place to eat and for being in a hotel was even better. We felt more like an place in town. It had a lot of choices to choose from and staff was great and really friendly.
3
Dining in this restaurant gave me quite a familiar vibe as its decor and layout were similar to the lobby outlet at the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore. Its high ceiling was an assurance that smells will not linger after I left the restaurant. The carpet was stained and dirty but I was told that the restaurant will be undergoing refurbishment soon.The buffet spread was lined across 2 sides of the restaurant. Local dishes dominated the spread and items like popiah, roti prata, laksa, etc. found favour with patrons. Live stations prepared certain items on the spot. The day I was there, 2 styles of rice dishes, none of them steamed; were on the spread. Personally, I felt the laksa should come with pieces of fried beancurd. The dessert spread was extensive though. Hygiene was compromised slightly when I found a team member using bare fingers to sprinkle chopped greens on my pasta, if my eyes were not deceiving me. I would have preferred if he had worn disposable gloves while doing so.That being said, the service staff were attentive and made it a point to clear empty plates off tables regularly. Compliments go out to Pandian, who saw that the afternoon sun rays were shining through the glass floor-to-ceiling glass panels and offered us a change of tables. Well done
3
Celebrated Father's Day at the Dining Room with their Sunday brunch. The place was only 1/3 filled despite the occasion. The staff were friendly and services were good. They provided my 4 year old niece with children utensils. Clearing of plates and topping up of water was efficient. However, the food was normal but the price was on the high side given the variety. Would only.visit again if there are promotion.
4
We ordered a la carte and discovered that this place serves fried laksa. It's definitely the first time I've ever heard of fried laksa. It was a local classic with a twist - we loved it! I also really enjoyed the lobster with vermicelli dish.The ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. Comfortable dining with very friendly servers. They gave us great recommendations and we felt very much at home.
3
The breakfast is good, The laksa is a must try! The Laksa is the only reason I wake up early for!The hotel host some mainland china tourist, I'm glad that some times the hotel will separate the china tourist in a function room to have their own breakfast so they wont disturb the other guests. Dont waste money and time on the buffet dinner, that's all :-

"...WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT, BUT VERY SAD TO SAY.. QUITE DISAPPOINTING ~ WAS IT A BAD NIGHT..? ~ SHERATON SHOULDN'T HAVE 'BAD NIGHTS'...!"Coming from Melbourne, Australia to FABULOUS Singapore for 12 days - My family of 5 wanted to eat the best...!!!Had heard so much about THE DINING ROOM Dinner Buffet at the Sheraton Towers, Scotts Road..!!Alas, we were incredibly DISAPPOINTED with the FOOD:1. Meagre display of COLD SEAFOOD, and the OYSTERS ran out about half an hour after we arrived.. I think I might have nabbed the last 3...2. Poor show of CHARCUTERIE and SALADS...3. Very, very ORDINARY choice of MAINS with only 1 RED MEAT on offer.. [RED is the word - the smallish side of beef was literally oozing blood - Honestly, just over the top for us, and anyone really - Just sickening to view...]4. Very few VEGETABLE DISHES on offer - Just 1 or 2, and these were always empty...5. DESSERTS were NOT of the standard I'd expect from the SHERATON... Very FEW choices, and Very BASIC make...DRINK ORDER offers, on the other hand were constant, and the alcoholic ones came fast.. Real problem with non-alcoholic drinks was that they had no idea what a Lemon, Lime & Bitters was.. Nor a Lime Soda..? We found this a little far-fetched... I'd rather think it was a communication problem... Very strange...?Anyway, I don't think we'll be visiting again... Very POOR VALUE FOR MONEY... Such a shame, but, just SO much WONDERFUL FOOD on offer, elsewhere in Singapore...##To the powers that be - You've really got to 'scrub up' your act...!!!Visited in December 2015 for Dinner, whilst on family holiday.

Tried their Lunch buffet on weekday. The place gave us a first good impression that a landscaped garden outside with waterfall and pond. Then we had a look at the buffet spread. We were quite disappointed that limited buffet selection. We had no choice since we already there. The food was not worth the value except the lovely ambience
5
Tried their buffet during our stay at Sheraton hotel. Came in at 6.45pm when my booking at 7pm. Staff direct us to our seat and serve drinks for us. Told us nicely that buffet will starts at 7 and chef is preparing the food. Without realizing it's 7, staff politely inform us that food is ready and off we go! Food spread is good. Dirty plates was cleared fast, very fast. Drinks was fill up quick too. At one point, when I was having my steak, the staff know I Am having a hard time in cutting the steak and the knife used wasn't steak knife. He gave me a steak knife immediately. Oysters is very fresh. With a reminding Note attached.. when bill was here we pay according and when the staff is back with the change I was kinda surprised on the change as bill initially wasn't that cheap. And he explain there's discount. Thumbs up for the services. Definitely will come back again!
5
Usually I have buffet which is very good this time the chicken penne pasta was my meal of choice. Enjoyed it but next time back to the buffet.
4
The Food is very good & fresh we satisfied when we had buffet dinner so many choice and the dessert is also very good.
5
As I mentioned in my review, Eric was very friendly and helpful a real asset to the hotel. The food selection was just to my taste. I couldn't have enjoyed myself more.
3
Service was slow that evening. The food was not as expected. The Nasi Goreng was average. The pasta with alfredo sauce was also average - the sauce was a bit too thick and heavy.
5
A comfortable place to come back to after a stressful day in the offiece. The noise from the passage way gets into the room.
4
The rating is really for the service provided by the attentive and warm service staff who made the dining experience pleasant. Food wise - cold dishes such as oysters weren't too bad.Hot dishes - limited selection. I only had the clam chowder soup, if I remember right.Ambience - lovely as the lounge is just beside the restaurant so I was rather entertained by the live music.Will I go again? a lot of motivation and a huge discount, maybe
4
I went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago for my wife Birthday lunch, only two of us.We went early and was seated on the upper stage area, quite near to its greenery view. Service was great, food was amazing, oyster, crab, mussels, laksa, salad, dessert were all fresh and nice. The ambience actually that we enjoyed the most, quiet, green, and the restaurant looks (old but stylish)
4
Visited on a Tuesday night for dinner, the restaurant was quiet, 4 tables including us. Ordered Beef Burger, not bad, fries was nice, however on 1 note, they don't make the patties juicy, very dry, thus they freeze they patties. Nice view on the waterfall. Service wise is good.....atmosphere not so good. There's alot of ware and tear. Its a old hotel so carpets are stained. There were some ants though, but on the floor. Nonetheless, the experience was fairly good
4
I must say the buffet dinner I had was nice and selections of foods was acceptable but not many. I love their fresh lobsters and cray fish , sushi bar and the dessert sections is impressive. The service is good and the ambience of the restaurant is warm and beautiful. Sheraton guest must try this resto.
3
I have been to that restaurant dozens of times with customers staying at the Sheraton.It's quite a good place for food in a business minded atmosphere. The big windows on the artificial cascade look good and modern.Quality wise food is very inconsistent. Some items are really good like the salmon or the Beef hor fun, some others are really not great (don't take the goulash !!!).Lunch Buffet is quite decent.Overall quite an expensive place thought
