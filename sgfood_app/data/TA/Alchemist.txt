You must try the the Mocha and the Dark Matter Coffee. It's a small place run by young people who make your coffee just right!

Unfortunately this place is not easy to find, I'm lucky to have found it passing by. This upstart coffee place keeps it simple: just fantastic coffee! Espresso drinks naturally but I notice "batch brew" on the board as well, drip made? There are also beans unground with a grinder if you like and some coffee making materiel (eg. Aeropress) on offer too. I think they also roast their own beans. For espresso drinks you can choose their standard blend (Dark Matter) or a rotating other choice. If you're looking for something a bit more interesting and "real"/local this is your place
