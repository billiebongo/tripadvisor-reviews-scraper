Great food, friendly conversation and nice cosy place for a meal. This place is one of the gem in Singapore. Worth a visit.
5
We had a quiet lovely yummy dining experience with fresh ingredients , delicious wines too ! Attentive service and friendly :)

Had really high expectation of the lunch menu. Our tomato soup was excellent. But mains were a little disappointing. Their forte is still desserts. With that said, its an excellent place. Will come back
5
Went there for lunch to try out their mains after having tried their desserts on a previous occasion. The desserts were fantastic, probably one of the best in Singapore, and their food was good as well.
5
Service was excellent, service staff is very knowledgeable. Food was delicious, including the birthday cake we ordered! Well done!

My wife had a dinner here with her friend in January. She liked it so much that we picked it for Valentine's day lunch. The style of the service is atypical in Singapore in a good way: the waiters are not only very nice but also explained to you all the ingredients about the dish and dessert. The dishes have very artistic presentation and the ingredients they used are all specially imported. As a "rule", each guest has to order a dessert with a special chosen tea to go along. It is a good rule otherwise you may missed out their super nice dessert. Price is at the high side but worthy it
5
The food is really made from the heart and feels really comforting, like you have gone back to your grandma's home for a meal. We had ribs marinated with heady Morrocan spices and a mushroom pasta which the staff gladly shared was made with 3 types of French mushrooms, Spanish garlic and in-house-made pasta.The cakes are made with finesse and has an amazing taste and texture. They also come with tea that are meant to complement the cake. We had Merry Yu (yuzu mousse, white chocolate mousse with reduced sugar and sponge) paired with Tibetan Chamomile (green tea, marigold, chamomile and mint), and Merry Fig (chocolate coating made with fig extract to get the purple tint, fig mousse, fig cream and double French caramel) paired with Peony White with Sultana Raisins.Food and dessert selections always change according to seasons, so you will never be bored. The staff are very attentive without being intrusive, and are obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about their offerings.The whole experience is worth every penny. Highly recommended

We are impressed with the level.of care and good faith that this restaurant has. We were asked if we had any food.allergy, food intolerant and allergies or.any special dietary needs. They put great care into making sure that one of our guests with diabetes and the other being a lifestyle vegetarian are well taken care of. Apparently they change the menu regularly and the season now is pop shop with French Asian fusion food. The group members were delighted with the food quality. The cakes and wines.are delicious. Will certainly be bac

Glad to be back !Only if every food operators are as passionate as these folks at Mad About Sucre. The menu changes seasonally and every season is planned with so much finesse. This is our 5th visit and every visit is an great experience.The foie gras and the tomato soup are excellent starters and the main course of Oxtail and foie gras pasta are absolutely stars !Desserts are the absolutely best and rivals the best in the world.If you ever get your hands on their very popular brandy cake and choc truffles during Christmas, grab them. Even my fussy Mum loves it!
5
We celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary with a truly delicious dinner. They went clean (not farmed) ingredients to avoid all the growth hormones in many of food ingredient).We started with their salad with bits of foie gras (a favourite that we try to avoid for healthy eating), grilled shrimp, egg and a spoonful of caviar balanced with their house mixed salad. We had the deep sea barramundi with light miso soup. Fish was tender and blended nicely with the smoked sliced eggplant.The main was a French baked rice with seafood and chorizo flambÃ©d with cognac before baking. The dish is a traditional dish in Marseille.The climax of the food journey was their dessert designed like a Christmas ball ornament. The dark chocolate was accentuated by cherry liquor. Wow
5
Best dessert I've ever had. If you are mad about desserts, just go to Mad About Sucre. Their desserts won't disappoint you!
5
Their desserts never disappoint. service standards were impeccable.
definitely worthy for an award!!
5
This time we ordered the beff salad, tomato seafood soup, the seafood paella, 2 sets of tea pairing desserts and a bottle of wine for 4 pax! Every details is being well taken care of, the foods were as tasty as ever! My aim is to try everything on their menu, hopefully by then theyâ€™ll have new inventions again.
5
We made a special trip to this place based on ta reviews . It was well worth it. We ordered 3 different cakes and each was paired with a special blended in. What an experience. A special mention to the lovely gentleman that served us throughout . All ingredients used were informed paired with special selected blends of tea. Everything was explained in details . What a touch . Highly recommend.
5
I love this place. The food is so good and the cakes are the best I have tasted. I love cakes a lot and regularly try new cafes but I always come back to mad about Sucre because it is the best. The use all natural ingredients and do not believe in using too much sugar. The way the cakes are displayed is also a piece of art.Food - The ribs and foie gras pasta are delicious.Cakes - All their cakes are fantastic! If you are lucky enough to have ordered their fruit cake for Christmas then congrats. It is the best fruit cake ever.The atmosphere is also relaxed but refined. Eric and James are always so friendly and enthusiastic about the food
5
Cakes are still top class, so is the new menu for the wine and food. We had a great productive business dinner there and my business partner went back for dinner with his family the next day, which is a great testament of how great this restaurant is.A great place for fine food without the formality of a fine dining restaurant. Service is still as personal without being intrusive. Definitely on my list as one of the best 
5
My 3rd visit here and our experiences are as good as new. Lunch menu is still amazing as with the cakes. The seafood broth pasta, the salad and the pork belly are excellent and the House-pouring wine still as goodCakes, my partner, first time here and a baker herself, commented that these cakes are absolutely the one of the best amongst the best pastry shops in the world. Pricing wise, not the cheapest but you get more than what you paid for especially for such natural high quality ingredients.Overall an amazing experience
5
I m an extremely fuzzy with food. This place nailed it. The lamb is cooked to the right texture - not over nor undercooked. The salad taste great. The mango dessert is the best and goes so well with the tea. One thing about the dessert is that the taste of mango, cheese, and the tea are so distinctive that I have to give credits to baker. Well done 
5
They offer meals selections besides an array of desserts/cakes and teas. Food was decent and service was good. I like it that service staff made sure we know what food we're eating. Make sure to reserve their desserts if you're there for meals first as it is while stocks last. I remember they do not take credit cards
5
When visiting Singapore and you love fine dining then Mad About Sucre on 27 Teo Hong Road is the go to spot. Ask for Mr. James Tan and he will rock your world. The place serves different kinds of fine pastry inspired by the French, all with an Asian twist. Every course is served with a different kind of tea and complements each dessert perfectly.Hopefully I'll be visiting you guys soon again
5
I will always bring my friends/love ones to mad abt sucree for their first time. Never fail to wow my guests. Great service, great place, awesome food!

Very bad customer service. Will not recommend to visit. Unpleasant experience. Will not step foot in the place ever again.

After my first visit to Mad About Sucre, I have been wanting to come here again. But it is only until now I can squeeze out some time to satisfy my cravings for meticulously prepared, fine French confectionery. The idyllic, swish place is still immersed in that Parisian vibe, completed with light French music, and the service is still as warm and friendly though the new young chap has lots to learn from the owners.What has changed is the line-up of cakes, just like how the best restaurants of the world change their menus seasonally, to continually surprise and tantalize our palates with new creations.In addition to the delightful, delicate cakes, Western Provincial Dining is introduced into the menu. And this gives me more reasons to go here for an exceptional complete dining experience.The Spring Tangy Tomato Soup is exactly as the name suggests: tangy, at just the right level where the palates are teased and the appetite is whetted, without overwhelming the natural sweetness of the tomatoes. Talking about tomatoes, along with the sun-dried tomatoes used to introduce the hint of the smoky flavour, 2 types of French tomatoes are utilized to make this soup, and one of them is the heirloom beefsteak. And these tomatoes yield incredibly sweet soup with a myriad of flavours due to the numerous aromatic compounds of the different types of tomatoes. This dish is not just about the soup—hidden beneath the soup is a stash of fresh Arctic Snow Crabs. Amazingly, the lovely, distinctive briny flavours of the crab is accentuated, instead of eclipsed, by the strong taste of the tomatoes. With that said, this is a great dish to start the meal with.The salad totally wins me over to declare that it is a must to try to the dishes in Western Provincial Dining menu. It is no mere salad. Luxurious, sinful ingredients such as French foie gras, grilled prawns, and caviar are added to staples of egg and fresh, crisp greens. The foie gras is cooked until it is crispy on the surface while retaining the soft interior, which is full of oily goodness. Grilled prawns are so fresh, sweet and intense in flavour—the prawns are perfectly prepared to unlock the full extent of the aroma of grilled seafood, I have to say the grilled prawn here is one of the best prawns I have tried. Most probably the best, on par with the prawn I had in a Michelin Star restaurant. Caviar replaces salt in this dish for dashes of saltiness and sprinkles of umami. And I absolutely welcome this since savouring the relish of the sea encased within each black pearl of the caviar is pure indulgence. Amid the lush savours, the egg adds a nice earthy flavour to balance the flavours of the salad and give variations to the overall taste. It is not only the ingredients that shine, the combination of these ingredients works to create a dish that features flavours of a wide spectrum while ensuring these flavours complement each other. Oh yes, the sweet, slightly tangy French mustard sauce does great to make the greens a delight to tuck into while staying in the background to let the other ingredients take the central stage.With all these being said, it is without a doubt that I am looking forward to go back

My family, from old to young, loved the whole experiences here. The western food here appeals to the whole family with the great quality and excellent tastes. The tomatoes stew and the salads are excellent starters. The mains are of good portions. The wines, though slightly higher priced than the usual restaurant, are of good quality even the house wines too.The cakes are no doubt the best here in the region. The spread was different from what we tried before but the current line-up is more impressive than before. The lime pastry, the coffee cake, the guava-cheese cake and the dark chocolate cakes are excellent. Do not miss these cakes !Overall, an great finale to our last night in Singapore. Prices are on the higher side, but for what you get, it is certainly of very good value while compared to many restaurants
5
We were here on Sunday and the place was crowded. The clientele was interesting as it had a very mixed clienteles, from well-dressed to hipsters and casually-dressed and kids. But everyone seemed to be at ease with each other and enjoying the food, drinks and cakes that were served here. Fully packed, the service was passionate and sincerely. The server explained all the food as they served. We were awed by the inspiration and the creative process behind each dishes. These guys are really passionate about what they do. With such passion, the quality of the French food was authentic and it exceeded our expectations, even the old folks are duly happy with what they ate. The foie gras salad, the pork belly, seafood rice, barramundi and foie gras pasta were were. Do not miss out the cakes as they are certainly the best that we have tasted in Malaysia, Singapore, HK, Indonesia, Bangkok and Indonesia.The cocktails were delicious too, a total of 13 orders of cocktails between 3 drinking adults and 3.5 hours of a wonderful Sunday spend here.Overall, the premium pricing here are totally justified by the excellent quality of the food, drinks and the cakes, supported by a wonderful cast of passionate staff and a lovely ambiance
5
Mad About Sucre serves authentic food that does not use any artificial flavouring and once you put the food in your mouth, you will be able to taste the effort and authenticity of the food. Both the mains as well as the desserts are superb and i love everything about the place
5
As a vegetarian, I was totally happy with the options here. The menu was well thought out. The quality of food and drinks were of very high standards and we were very motivated to come back again for next day. The highlights of our visits were the cakes... Mad About Sucre serves the best cakes, the 1982 White Lime was divine and the Sunkissed was a hit with the group. Who can missed out their decadent yet oh-so-light dark chocolate cake.One of the best dining experiences without the stiff upper lips service, great food quality and excellent cakes

I spent my birthday dinner there with my family and the food (and desserts) did not disappoint! I loved the beef (that mushroom sauce was yum)! The prices are on the slightly high side, if it were slightly lower I would have set the value at 5* (
4
I have to say, this is the first time I'm giving a F&B outlet full score for its food offerings! Am glad they have taken a step further to incorporate a food menu to compliment its past dessert-only menu. Their foie gras is responsibly sourced, where geese are not forced fed! Remember to end your meal on a sweet note with their decadent desserts; made from natural ingredients with no sugar added. Go ahead, feed your desires guilt-free
5
It was an awesome experience there celebrating my hubby bday there~ love their service. Their food is unique and interesting yet tasty! Not to forget their delicious desserts
5
best place for tete a tete with friends and close associates. cosy and impeccable food and service. would highly recommend this for normal and special occasions. It never seizes to amaze me.
5
Always a great experience to dine at this restaurant. Love their wonderful variety of cakes and the specialised teas that go with it. Will definitely want to go back again another day.
5
We have been going to this restaurant since it first opened in 2015. It has never failed to amaze and impress us with their food! Few restaurants have been able to be so amazingly consistent with all their dishes. Be prepared to be surprised every season because they only serve what they feel is the best. Last but not least, the one thing that makes us return all the time, is the excellent excellent service!
5
The service team is so knowledgeable about what they are serving, including the origins of the ingredients, the cooking methods and the inspirations behind each dish. We were all very impressed by the high standards of service, The excellent quality and taste of the food and cakes and the on-point wine and cocktail pairing.One of our business associates had quite a few dietary precautions and all were take care of by the Service team. It is great to know that in this modern day where everything takes on a shorter route, this restaurant still cooks and bakes everything in-house from scratch using fresh and natural ingredients with no flavor enhancers and synthetic ingredients. This place triumphs over many award-winning restaurants and we were glad to have been recommended to this place in Singapor
5
I don't write reviews but this establishment deserves my effort to share my findings of this wonderful place.We love this place to bits and fancy finding such an authentic establishment in Singapore. The quality of food, drinks and wine is excellent. The cakes are out of this world.We came here twice for dining during our stay in Singapore. The lunch and dinner ambiance is very different yet the service is equally impressive. The standouts were oxtail, foie gras pasta, steak and the salads. We tried all the cakes over 2 visits and every desserts were outstanding. Wish they could open this reastaurant-cakeshop in my city.Coming from french heritage, this place is a precious with very authentic high quality standard of gourmet menu, yet the environment and ambiance is relaxed, comfortable, down-to-earth and non of that high-brow service etiquette. Actually, we would deliberately transit our flights in Singapore so that we can return to this fine establishment
5
Amazing home cooked European cuisine and desserts, great french wines and cocktail. It was a packed full house and services were personal yet non-intrusive. The atmosphere and the vibes were great and the group of us had a great time here. The dining experience here was indeed unforgettable
5
Went to the cafe with my girlfriends without doing any prior research. We only knew he place has good reviews and now we totally know why.Firstly the cakes were DELICIOUS, all of them are super well crafted to the finest details and every ingredient complements each other. The tea selection were amazing!Next, the service was by the crew was superb. Every course (cake and tea) was followed up by detailed explanation and description of the item you have purchased. It makes you know what you eat and appreciate it much more!Last but not least, the overall ambience and interior space of the cafe. We went at night and the atmosphere was really great for a hearty chat between your friends, families or your SO.Definitely will visit again for their food and more desserts
5
Mad About Sucre is a great example of a restaurant that really cares about every ingredient that is used to create a dish, be it a starter, main or (my Favourite) Desserts! My understanding is they fly in the various seasonal ingredients to keep the freshness at optimal. Best part is, we never get bored because the menu changes every quarter. Which also means we need to minimally visit the restaurant once a quarter to check out the new menu.There's a story to each dessert, every dessert is yummy! I hardly say this. But EVERY dessert.... Been there for birthdays, random meal, Saturday tea and desserts, chocolate truffle or their Christmas Rum Cake. (Must Try!
5
Just out of this restaurant where I had the best mushroom linguine I have ever eaten.This restaurant is a gem. My second visit and just as delighted as the first one.The owner introduces you to his menu with the same passion as he puts to sourcing his ingredients. And the wine he suggested married every choice each guest had made, in the occurrence a Meursault.The desserts come one at a time and are shared by all guests, my favourite being the unsweetened chocolate one that lived on in my memory since my last visit.It is fairly pricey but you won't be disappointed

We were supposed to meet two more friends at this cafe, as she was the one who recommended Mad About Sucre. I arrived early and decided to get us a table for 4 first.Upon arrival, we were told that they have a house rule/minimum spend of one cake and one drink per person. I explained to him that my friends do not like desserts and only two of us wants to eat, so that would be drinks for all of us and two cakes at least. We are uncertain if we would be ordering more due to (a) we have not been to this place (b) we are not sure if anybody wants to even eat. We were given another option for those who doesn't want a cake, could get themselves a cocktail. Why would I want a cocktail on a Sunday afternoon???? Plus my friends who doesn't eat dessert, doesn't drink either.I personally think the house rule is ridiculous. It sounds like they are forcing people to order... So they are indirectly telling people that if you're not spending this much, forget about it. This is absurd - I might've ordered more if I like it but why would I give in to a place I've never even been to??? Rules are dead, be more flexible. We left shortly after, and went to Epiphyte (within walking distance) which was a much better option, at least they did not force us with some silly rule.Nevertheless, staffs were very nice and well-mannered. They even told us to sit around in the air-conditioned cafe first till our friends arrive to decide. Then again.... It wasn't the staff's fault, just that kind of rule will ruin their name.

the shop spent much effort and was very passionate about cakes and dessert.
highly recommended to go if you are in the neighborhood.
i would visit again to try their hot dishes.
overall nice experience, just price is a bit steep.
5
Never understand that "Desserts" are spelled backwards when I am "Stressed"...until I discovered Mad About Sucre. Thanks for the enlightenment!
5
This is me and girlfriend third time back at mad for sucre.
Everytime we are here, its always an different amazing experience. Customer Service is excellent.
5
MAD ABOUT SUCRE is filled with inspiring creativity from the menu to the decor and the unassuming & friendly owners. I had a great time enjoying the food and soaking in the artistic yet cozy atmosphere. Will definitely be back again.
5
Definitely a must try for dessert lovers! The castile - I'm still thinking about it and moved by how how distinct, tasty and yet harmonious flavors of Lychee, strawberry Rhubarb, honey,white chocolate, yogurt and the white chocolate! Yum!Anemone, - tropical mousse with confit of pineapple, ginger gel, milk chocolate disc, hazelnut Chantilly and vanilla Choux Spon. It works wonderfully well and definitely one my favs! The savers De Printemps is just as good - and able to maintain its distinctive flavor with earl grey, apricot, grapefruit and the sponge. In fact, we had a total of 5 desserts are were truly impressed by all of them! Damn, words simply cannot do justice to the desserts ; you have have to go try it out yourself.Besides desserts, they served really good food too! We had the wild catch Salmon, steak, salad, Bacon/barramundi and the ogio olio with foie gras. All of which cooked to perfection, with unique combination, natural flavours and no preservatives. Just the 4 of us yet we had 6 main dishes and 5 desserts! How gluttonous of us! Service are impeccable, with the boys giving us full attention at all times and Chef Eric for sharing the ingredients of each dish/cake from all over the world with such passion. We will be back for more! Definitely one of the best desserts in Singapore! Looking forward to my next visit here
5
This restaurant / cafe serves food and cakes made by very passionate people. They took lots of pride in ensuring that we have a wonderful dining experience. We had order 11 dishes and the servers took time and pride to explain the idea origin of the dishes, how should one partake the dessert and what kind of feeling should we expect. Eric and two restaurant staff members made us really comfortable last evening. The dessert encourages us to rethink how good dessert should be, how well food can be made from no preservatives, no added sugar and salts. The ingredient flew from all over the world, we were mentioning to Eric (who is the Chef on a rotational routine to serve the guest at front line) that it is like "around the world in 2 hours" and "let's head back to France for desserts" at the end. Our friends and I already planned the date for next visit to this wonderful hidden gem
4
Nice food although maybe a bit too creative. The lamb was excellent, the fish rolled in bacon a bit less. The wine selection is good. The desserts are excellent, as expected. We had a table at the end of the restaurant which was very dark, it would be great to have more light there
4
For 2 small eaters like us, we ordered a salad, a main, 2 cakes and 2 pots of caffeine free tea (pairing done by the staff). It was my 5th visit and I have enjoyed the cakes and tea very much. I read some past reviews commenting that they do not serve water and they do not refill the tea. However this was no longer true when I was there. Maybe the management has made changes to their services which I think is commendable.The salad was really good. I also love the cakes.
4
Dinner with my best friend, and it certainly was a great choice that we made! We heard about the wonderful reviews on their cakes, and wanted to try out their dinner menu. Service was impeccable, almost equivalent to the fine dining standards! The service staff took their time to explain the menu, how they cook it, the ingredients sourced. I really like how they don't look as if they were just rattling away because its part of their job, but that they genuinely take pride in their job and food. One thing worth mentioning is that they do not use any msg or preservative in their food. We had the starter which was a sharing platter and it was simply delicious. The mains though, it was a hit and miss. The oxtail penne was great and it was polished off within minutes. But the wild salmon was abit too dry for me. The cakes were of course the main stars. And divine indeed they were. We had 1 starter, 2 mains, 3 cakes and the tea pairing. For for a total of $180. Oh, and I also like the fact that they only had around 10 tables, thus even though it was full, you don't feel claustrophobic and could have a decent conversation with your partner. Great decor as well!I can't wait to be back again to try the rest of the menu!
5
It's my x times to mad about sucre and every visit is always a good experience. Good ambience with lots of delicious food and cakes. Eric and crew made the dining experience very pleasant as they introduce you how each and every dish came about. Will definitely recommend this place for anyone.
4
it was very personalised, well thought and intricate decorations. they have amazing desserts which are beautifully put together and thoughtfully paired with their inhouse blends. thoroughly enjoyed my experience while i was there for 2 desserts and 2 pots of tea.
5
Post-Chinese New Year and this should be the time for austerity for a while - just to rest and recover. But oh my, it takes a stronger woman than me to resist the offerings here. Their french-inspired version of "yu-sheng" is a symphony of flavours - fresh sweet greens, crunchy nuts, perfectly smoked salmon. My taste-buds did a little dance of joy. I still dream of the salmon lasagna -sadly no longer available because the produce currently available isn't quite up to the chef's ridiculously (for him, but luckily for his customers') high standards. Every trip (yes, I'm a regular) is like a new adventure in discovery for my taste buds because the menu changes with whatever's best and available in that season. Oh, I haven't even mentioned the desserts yet, and that's what they're famous for...
5
Went for lunch with a friend at this place. The food was simply awesome (salad, aglio olio and yuzu desert), ordered simple dishes but everything was bursting with flavour. Only regret is the fleeting choices of food items (apparently menu keeps changing due to seasonal ingredients), probably also makes the next visit exciting. Something definitely worth doing. Staff also patiently explained the dishes and made sure we were comfy. Another thing to note is the exquisite sugar flowers that is displayed around the restaurant. Cannot imagine eating it
4
This is great place to indulge in some relaxing afternoon munchies and be sure to wash down the delectable treats with the pÃ¢tisserie's own blend of tea mixes. Get them to suggest the best cake and tea pairings to enhance your dessert experience
5
We visited Mad About Sucre while they were having their annual "Pop up" restaurant - three weeks of a fusion cuisine (inspired by the chefs' travels) that replaces the usual traditional French cuisine. We enjoyed Barramundi with a miso sauce; linguine with Yuzo sake, winter mushroom and bonito flakes;and a silken tofu salad with a wasabi, miso, sesame and balsamic; and a spectacular plate of chocolate delights. For each dish Eric our waiter (the chefs here do the service!) explained the ingredients and inspiration - no short cuts and an old school approach to preparing great meals.
5
It is one of those xmas dinner that brings to mind what Xmas is all about - sharing, giving, make merry and celebrating life. Kindness begets kindness, grace begets grace. The food is as good as I can imagine and more, if only pictures could be 4D! Thank you for the great hospitality. Will definitely come again soon

I ordered a Christmas takeaway from your menu. When asked to pay, you charged a price 10% above the stated value in the menu. Initially i thought it was just 7% GST, however i was told it is 10% "service charge". I was surprised by that because this is a take our service and not a dine in service and there is obviously no reason to charge a service charge, i wanted an explanation, the person who answered to my email named ERIC was extremely impatient. He says I DID NOT READ THE MENU CAREFULLY to know that there is a 10% service charge and ALL HIS CUSTOMERS WHO CALLED WOULD HAVE READ THE MENU. Excuse me?? I think this is already a lousy service, PLUS, you have to accuse your customers unprofessionally about NOT READING YOUR MENU? Where is the consumers rights here in Singapore? Explaining your menu to your customers is your responsibility and clarifying your charging is your responsibility and consumers rights. I will stay away from them ever ever again. I don;t think they live up to their SERVICE ratings on this TripAdvisor and all the media hype. STAY AWAY! And piece of advice, take away your 10% service charge when you don't provide service and especially if it is a lousy one
5
My husband suprised me with a dinner reservation here for our wedding anniversary. The food was excellent, service was wonderful and the staff explained the dish to us patiently and politely. We were very impressed by this. Desserts were better than expected and we were very satisfied by this experience overall.
4
All ingredients are organic and fresh. Food: Great Foie gras and Prawns are really tasty!! Overall the food is really good and so are their desserts!Service: could be improved however the staff are very warm and passionate about the food.Ambience is nice and great for couples as well. Price: it's on the expensive side however the experience is worth it.A must try

In June this year I visited Paris and had desserts at the famous Angelina cafe and Laduree. My opinion is that the cakes at Mad about Sucre are much better than cakes sold in those famous establishments in Paris. Very impressive. I also love the interior decor, this is one of the cutest cafe I have seen in Singapore.However, before you visit Mad about Sucre, you need to know that this is not a place where any number of you can just order one cake, have free water, and sit for many hours. I brought my husband and 2 kids last night and was told that we each have to order one cake or dessert. Each cake/dessert, about $12- $18 also comes with tea pairing at about $8. So for all 4 of us, we spent a total of $95. Service is excellent. I can feel that the staff are really very proud of their cakes. I remember my meal at Shinji by Kanesaka recently, when I asked the Japanese chef for soya sauce to go with my sushi, he refused and told me I should eat the sushi without soya sauce. So I understand that since the chef at Mad about Sucre thinks that a certain type of tea will bring out the best flavour in a certain cake, then we should respect that.Although I think that the cakes are really good, it is hard to say whether it is value for money. I will not hesitate going to my favourite Plain Vanilla Bakery, order one cupcake for $3.90 and sit for as long as I like. For Mad about Sucre, I will probably only go during special occasions.I do highly recommend Mad about Sucre if you want to splurge on desserts in Singapore. I have been to Henri Charpentier at Dempsey and Angelina Cafe at Capitol Piazza. Mad about Sucre is definitely the best choice
5
Mad About Sucre is always one of the destinations for me in Singapore. I feel good and relaxed to have a cup of tea and a beautiful cake here. Precious moment of the day!
5
I've frequented this gem at the edge of Chinatown for a hearty lunch, a delicate dessert paired with a cup of tea. Excellent hospitality. You get what you pay for.
Will definitely recommend and return whenever I'm back in Singapore.

we went to "Mad about Sucre" for dinner for a friends birthday - and i was just floored! i have not eaten THAT good in a long time! The restaurant / bakery is at the outskirts of chinatown and we easily found parking. when we entered it really looked just like a cafe and we were not sure if this was the right place - but we found out friends in the back. after browsing through the menu and getting some advice we all (6) had different dishes. i chose the wild Norwegian salmon with Iranian saffron and spanisch garlic - before we shared a wonderful "kings salad" with shrimp and fois gras. when the main course arrived the owner came to explain each dish and what was special about it... and it was unbelievable good! the subtlety of different flavours and the spices was very well balanced and the texture of the salmon was basically falling apart in my mouth! the confit of duck was also a feast for the tongue! overall the food was amazing with only the best and organic ingredients and the service was impeccable and and i barely noticed getting my wine glass refilled. then later we shared the deserts and all of them were excellent and had a wide variety of flavours from a creme brulee with fruits to my favorite a pecan mouse with some orange filling... i will certainly come back - the prices are of course fine dining - but in comparison for what is offered - you can spend a lot more in some high-end restaurant and not get the asme quality of food! if you want to have a wonderful cosy and personal dinner with extraordinary food - then is a place not to be missed!
5
My friends and I went to this amazing, exquisite and nice dessert place in Teo Hong Road and OMG they have the best desserts! We had 3 different desserts,passionfruit,creme brulee and chocolate noir! Let me tell you, they melt inside your mouth and then you will be indulged in this aaaaamazingggg overtaste. Each of them has different tea to pair with. They complement each other so well and thanks to the guy who takes his time to explain us the rationale of having different tea to enhance the flavor. Definitely worth to try

I made a reservation for six people at 8.30pm on a Saturday night and was asked if the reservation was "for dinner or just for desserts", through e-mail. It was for desserts and I got the reply that desserts reservation could only be confirmed at 9pm. I was to let the restaurant know which cakes I wanted so that the cakes would be reserved as most of them would have been sold out by that time. To my disappointment, only four cakes were left for us when we got there. Eric, one of the owners of the patisserie, told us that we were late and he had reserved some of our cakes for the other customers. He said they only hold reservations for ten minutes. I expressed that I was not told when I made the reservation. I asked why was I not given a call to confirm whether we were going, before giving our reserved cakes away to other customers, he said that he tried to call, but he did not have my contact number. Then he said that reservations are only held for fifteen minutes. Yes, he gave two different times for holding of reservations in less than a minute. He went on to say that I should have called since I was late. When I saw two other cakes on the left of the display counter and and asked about them, Eric said they were reserved for the two customers seated on the left. Then I saw two of the cakes that I reserved on the right of the counter and was told that they were for another two customers seated at a table to the right of the counter. I was deciding whether to stay or leave. I checked the time on my mobile phone was 9.18pm. So I asked Eric, is it possible that he had given our reserved cakes to other customers in just three minutes, his reply was "of course!" Then I told Eric that we would not have the cakes, he rudely replied, "Okay, bye!" Just when I was about to open the door, he rushed past us, grabbed the door handle and opened the door in a fashion that literally means "I'll show you the door". Even my fourteen and eleven years old children got his message loud and clear and were complaining to me when we were outside the shop. As we exited, he mumbled something which I couldn't make out, but it was loud enough for my godsister and children to hear. My eldest daughter asked if I heard him say, "You have got to be reasonable". My godsister also asked whether I heard him say "so rude". I had not been in any way rude. I was merely asking questions to understand the situation. I had not raised my voice or said anything disrespectful. Instead, the other person was full of arrogance and ill-mannered. My godsister agreed that Eric was extremely rude and totally unprofessional. It is clearly understood that reservations are made to avoid disappointment in case the restaurant is fully booked. Forgetting to ask a customer for contact number is truly unprofessional and it shows that they do not take pride in their reservation system. There were no customers who entered the shop just before us. The only four customers were already seated when we went into the shop. Considering that they had already decided in the cakes they wanted and were seated, and the time during which we were talking with Eric at the counter before I checked time time, I am very certain that the cakes were given away before 9.15pm. Refusal to own the mistake, push the blame to customers and the outward display of anger shows lousy customer service. Seems like satisfying customers is not an integral part of their business. Being overly anxious to avoid leftover cakes sends the message that money-making comes first and foremost. In the end, we found another nice patisserie nearby, with still lots of customers at around 9.45pm. So, though highly acclaimed, would one pay for good food but terrible customer service? Not me. I would give it a pass, because there is no lack of good patisseries around and certainly not this standard of service

I spent a couple of hours in a balmy afternoon at Mad About Sucre. Had tea, a piece of lemon tart and chatted with the owners. The service was fantastic. They were very attentive and always had a smile. The atmosphere was inviting and warm. The dÃ©cor was very modern. It's almost like you walked into someone's newly-remodeled living room and had afternoon with the owner of the house. There was no loud music, and everything felt very natural to me. I highly recommend Mad About Sucre for its delicious cakes and attentive servic
5
Fantastic peeps running the house. They know what they are serving and take pride in what they are serving as well. Patiently explaining the heart and soul that goes into all food and pastries.Food - Scratch Cooking, Slow Cooked, No Preservatives and No Artificial Flavours pretty much sums up their approach to food. Wonder natural flavours that goes with the season. Fuss free plating because they prefer to serve food hot. It reduces the change of flavour with cooling temperature.Environment - Not a big place but very cozy. There is enough space to all diners to enjoy their conversation over nice food, tea or pastries.It is really a gem in an overly commercialised F&B industry
5
You haven taste good desserts till you have eaten at Mad about sucre. Nothing compares to the surprise you get everytime they change their menu and the experience you get with every bite you take. Don't forget the savory menu. Expensive it may seem but so worth every cent :))) Service is impeccable and may only seem rude when they feel that the other customers are affected by rude people.
5
Visiting Mad About Sucre is like visiting friends who taught me how to eat well and better appreciate food. No visit leaves me unsatisfied - not with the food, the cakes, the tea nor the great hospitality received. Every change in menu brings me new surprises and I can't wait to make my way through everything. Savory hot dishes using the finest fresh ingredients to divine cakes paired with the most interesting blends of tea. Clearly a good refuge for our busy stressful life
5
Anyone peering into Mad About Sucre would be surprised by the clean, minimalist decor, providing a respite from the otherwise dull sidewalk. And this is exactly the hidden gem that the restaurant embodies - both in its exterior appearance & location and in the desserts & savouries concocted. A creatives dream, the restaurant combines unique elements, natural flavours and skips preservatives to serve up dish after dish of amazing food. Helmed by talented and driven owners and staff, they are dedicated to provide the perfect experience and holistic taste journey for all their patrons. Im glad i managed to stumble upon such a perfect little escape pod amidst the hustle and bustle of the busy Singapore cityscape. :) A definite must g
5
I went there with friends and we all loved the desserts there. We tried 5 type of cakes and they are all very impressive. The service is great too. It's great place to enjoy with friends.
5
How I would word this is, heaven on earth!!! The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Just wish have more time to try everything on their menu.
5
The best desserts I've ever have. Each cake has its own characteristic. Service is excellent. This truly will be the reason for us to come back to Singapore.
5
Born with a sweet tooth, how could I miss out on this place? Lured by the gushing reviews of my friends, I visited the establishment and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED! Whilst they are famous for their pastries and sweets (and rightly so!) I was surprised and intrigued by the savoury menu and gave that a go, and man was that a good decision, the staffs were patient and assisted my choice by explaining the food and going so far as to suggesting the food I can try based on my palette and explaining the reasons for their selection.Then the sweets came, each with its intricate story to paint a picture that made me appreciate the creations all the more~ Layered tastes is how I'd describe them, so take you time and slowly divvy up the myriad of flavors within each bite to get the best experience outta the cakes
5
Went back for their latest menu and my now 8 year old was full of praises about their pasta. We had a linguine carbonara with bacon and linguine with mushroom and spicy romaine tomatoes. All I can say is that the bowls were empty with the sauce scrapped off. The best was the dessert we ordered, Chocolat Noir, which is brilliantly baked with different chocolate. It just taste amazing, my sonny's eyes lit when he had his first bite. A must try for chocolate lovers! We are definitely coming back for more
2
Two of us ordered a cake and a tea to share. That is cos' we were in the area and chanced upon this seemingly nice cafe. We didn't come specially to spend an afternoon there.When we requested for our teapot to be refilled, we were told that it couldn't be done without a charge. The staff explained politely that they didn't want customers spending too little money and too long a time in their cafe (something to this extent). Cafe wasn't even packed. Poor service policy aside, the cakes look better than they taste. I will never support such a pretentious establishment. I will never return (particularly when the desserts weren't great) and will ensure that I pass on my bad experience to friends
5
My friends and I were looking for a place to chill out & have desserts after dinner on a Friday night, and where else but to head towards Mad About Sucre! Eric and James were lovely hosts as they always have, and our group of 4 were treated once again, to the best cakes made of only the finest ingredients! 2 of my friends, who were there for the first time, had nothing but praises for chef Lena who truly baked with love, using only the freshest ingredients! A most welcoming place to head to if you're looking for the highest quality cakes! Be prepared to be pampered by the wonderful service of James & Eric too :)
4
Trendy, conceptual and a poetic restaurant. Love the dessert and tea pairing menu. Service is friendly and nice however, their staff needs more flair of eloquence in reciting their "poems" and serving of tea. Despite the "faux pas", it is still a place you impress and wow your guests with their desserts
5
I found these place while watching a youtube video guide about the best places to eat in Singapore. And wow what an experience it was. Very cute almost girlie decor but very refine with good taste. The staff walks you through each pastry with all their own specifities and how to eat it correctly to get the most out of it to experience what the chef had in mind while making it. It was an amazing experience. Great feeling. The deserts themselves are inspired by French classical pastry but they add their own asian twist to it to make light and modern. They've all studied in France to fully understand the exquisite cuisine and refinement and mastering the complciated technics. It's an explosion of taste, it's delightful ! You appreciate each bit. Plus the fact that each desert is paired with a tea is a great concept never seen before. It's unique and enhances to whole experience. Very smart of them to do so.Really two thumbs and recommended it for everyone. And trust I'm french so i know couple things about deserts ;)See you soon guys and thanks for the special moment you gave me

For a cafe that (boldly) only serves dessert, you can expect quality sweets and higher prices. There were 5 of us and we shared 4 desserts and 2 pots of tea (specially paired for the desserts). The first 2 desserts, some layered creations, were light, refreshing and not too sweet. Off to a good start. The mini croquembouche was a disappointment. I expected fluffier cream puffs but they were a bit on the hard side. They used matcha as well as mascarpone filling. Last dessert was creme brûlée- lots of alcohol, absolutely delish. The floral teas were nice and light and staff also brought some cocktails for us to try. They also came round to chat with us and are a friendly bunch. Nice way to end the evening
5
Excellent service with great food and atmosphere! We love the food, ambience and beautiful decor. Great experience! Highly recommended.
5
Ladies were served with a sweet and pretty pink plate. Guys were served with white plate. Cutlery were placed on nice serviette. Thoughtful service. Yummy food and cosy ambience!
5
Very friendly staff and owner. Desserts are very well executed with a theme to every dish. The pairing tea goes very well with the dessert.
5
When my wife 1st brought me to this cosy little place, I was sceptical about the prices & I was also never really a cake person. That was 1 year ago on my birthday & we have been coming back for more.The delicious cakes (unlike those sugar loaded creations readily sold elsewhere) & the more recently introduced main course & side dishes are actually deservingly priced or even cheap, considering the top quality & freshness of ingredients.The service is undeniablely sincere & so friendly, it feels like friends who have known us for years.All these have let us to spend every special occasion from our birthdays, dating anniversary & even our wedding with Mad About Sucre.We just celebrated my wife's birthday there & we will be back next month for my birthday
5
Each time I visit Mad about Sucre feels as though I am in a Burgundy Winemaker's Cellar. Passion and philosophy-driven enthusiasm demonstrated by them in explaining their creations are de rigueur, and they are especially patient and happy to indulge you should you show further interest and curiosity about the details - the origins of the ingredients and the techniques employed for the particular creation you are about to savor. And just like a Burgundy, their creations can require a certain mindfulness to enjoy, but the results can be astounding - an unfolding of flavors through your palate driven by the thoughtful symphony of the carefully curated ingredients and textures from their techniques. Looking forward to their 2016 creations

It was on most of the best cake shops in SG. Made a trip down and found it worth traveling.. Hide in the nice row of shophouses with an eye catchy signboard. Walked in and enjoyed the interior design & decorations around. Quickly approached by host and given a seat. Explained the menu & given proper time to make decision. Had one of the best surf & turf mini burger $27( salmon tartare & beef ) , everything into perfection.. Small bites that's so good that I ate 5 of them within minutes. Followed by Full Chocolate Platter $27 with a pot of in house blended tea. There were white chocolate Jasmine macaroon, white chocolate mousse with espresso jelly, pralines, tart chocolat, truffles.. Followed the sequences they recommend and enjoy every elements within. Had some chat with one of the Owner, Eric. Got to know their stories, principles, concept towards food & beverage. Mad about Sucre is not just an ordinary cake shop, they beyond to provide some of the best dining experience in SG. Kudos

We came across this dessert cafe near Outram Mrt. First, we were attracted by their cosy ambiance and some whimsical merchandises displayed inside. Then, to our surprise, their food and desserts were really nice and with beautiful food presentation. There are so many other eyes catching desserts yet to try. Definitely will visit again.A great place for gathering with friends and family as well. Value for money with friendly and good service. Highly recommended!

This is a place you will never want to miss!!! We were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome from the service staff when we stepped into Mad About Sucre. Very personalized and attentive service was provided. Knowing that I was pregnant then, the staff specifically recommended non-alcoholic cakes, starting from the lightest to the strongest in flavours. We particularly like the Moulin Rouge, slightly-charred caramel mousse with walnut parfait and almond brittle, and Passionne, a light cheese cake with hints of passionfruit and coco nip crunch. Personally, I am never a fan of caramel or sweet stuff but after eating their cakes, you would never want to try cakes from elsewhere! Worth to mention is that the owners also personally blend their tea to pair with your cakes! I just love their cakes so much and even ordered a full month cake for my baby!Recently, we heard that Mad About Sucre is running a Pop Shop during this period. We had such a lovely time here. The food and desserts are all inspired from the owners' travel journals. Simply love their Soup of Cabbage & Leek Puree, King Prawn Aglio Olio, Cajun Pork Ribs, Seafood Stew and Symphony of Chocolates, even my little one asked for more white chocolate mousse!!!Will definitely visit again!!!

Recently visited Mad About Sucre and saw an exchange between a staff and a customer. Everyone watched the entire incident with curiosity. The customer requested for change of chair without backing to one that has backing but was rejected. The reason given was no other empty chairs were available (even though one can see empty chairs at other tables) and when the customer pointed out these other chairs, the staff said the chairs in the cafe cannot be moved (even though you can see they were not chained to the floor). The exchange went on for a while and then the staff repeated a few times, "Thank You, please leave", which was a shocking outcome even to us who were watching the entire episode and the customer left angrily. The customer service certainly leaves much to be desired and the Singapore service industry still has a very long way to go.
5
I chanced upon this place, and I was awed by the dessert n the decor of this eatery. The owners are so passionate of their dessert that I am now so interested to start baking!
1
Just received super bad service at Mad at sucre. One guy (could be the boss) refused to let me have a seat with backing when there are empty ones all around. He said it can't be moved, said customers cannot choose chairs! The seats are all same and not fixed to the ground so why can't it be move? He does not even wants to move the extra chair from other tables for me. He is super rude. SKIP THIS PLACE
5
Amazing food and desserts only to be equalled with impressive service. The cakes are so good and it changes according to the seasons and paired with much love with tea selected to enhance your dining experience. Very impressed with the service and the newly added savourie
5
I have to confess that I came down to this place because it used to be my office some 10 years ago. And surprised that it had been transformed into a restaurant.But then the cake display was so interesting and I had been searching for a nice Christmas log cake and why not try the place out.Today, we tried the Mont Blanc cake. There's a story to every cake here and the care that is put into using only the finest, seasonal ingredients. And matching with home-blended tea. This is a winner.It reminds me of Angeline's in Paris (but without the hot chocolate).Every mouthful is a delight on the senses. Delicate and despite the name, nothing tastes overly sweet. Rather, the balance is just right.The staff take time to share the stories of the cake and how it has been designed to be eaten.There's an obvious pride and passion with the staff and rightly so. Highly recommended for cake lovers who want quality

My partner and I wanted to have a good dinner but ended up very disappointed. Left the dinner restaurant without clearing the food we ordered. Feeling discontented, my partner suggested we go for some cakes. We headed down to Mad About Sucre. It was quiet when we arrived, but it didn't bother us. Though it was a small selection on the shelf, it was still hard for me to decide. Finally picked 2 cakes (Fruit cake and their signature San Domingue) and a pot of tea recommended by staff. We enjoyed both cakes and the tea very much. Bad dinner but great cakes! I will be back for more :
1
Me and my friend just ordered a cake each on a Sunday afternoon.The cake was decent and fairly priced. Creative and had a different flair to it.However what frustrated me most about the owner was that when i had asked for a glass of water due to my scratchy throat he initially wanted to get it for me, then came back with an excuse that they do not serve tap water to patrons. There was no option to purchase.Upon payment, i realised that everyone else had a glass of water on their table.What frustrates me even more was the owners excuse: "They were eating savory food and needed the water to pair with it."I'm sorry it was a crime that i could only afford a cake at your store, next time i feel thirsty i will order a lunch set or some hot food so that you can serve me water. If i am forced to return that is
5
This place is magical in not only the food they serve but also the decoration, it is honestly like walking into a dream. I have been here so many times and it is my favourite place for dessert in Singapore!! The tea and the cake is perfect. You must visit!
5
So impressed by the artistically crafted, delicious cakes at Mad About Sucre! The cakes are served one at a time based on intensity and each paired with a matching tea blend. One word: BLISS. Needless to say, our party of four thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we'll definitely be back for more! Highly recommend the following: Le Camibi (Almond, Hazelnut, Vanilla)San Domingue (Chocolate mousse, Plantain, Vanilla cream, Rum jewel box)Rue Montorguiel (Pistachio cream, Liquored-soaked cake, Brandied cherry)Amour (Yuzu, White chocolate cream
5
if anyone puts love in making desserts, it's them. the first time i was there, i was totally bowled over by the service, the way they have planned their serving style and of course, the desserts.the experience here is like a having desserts in a fine-dining restaurant where desserts are served in sequence, accompanied by a specially made tea, and each has its own story. i would have to say, it is a first in singapore. the staff there are totally friendly, and more than happy to share and chat. they have also recently started serving savouries. i would almost say, this is a must try if you are in the area. call beforehand to make reservations on the famed desserts! they run out too early
5
This is the best place for cakes in the world. It's a true adventure of the senses. You order the cake of your liking and then you'll be served the matching tea. The French inspired delights create a true festival in your mouth. In one word it's just mmmmh
1
Cakes were mediocre, prices were on the high side. Service was average, and it was difficult to find parking in the vicinity.
With the number of cake shops to choose from in Singapore, perhaps other places would be more convenient and tasty.
4
I've been following them on Instagram, then I accidentally passed the shop so I decided to give it a try, & wow it's amazing the cakes were displayed nicely & meticulously. The wait staff is so patient to described the tart & what drink is nice to go w/ it I ordered "coco citron" it's so yummy. They don't refill hot water for the tea though. But will still go back to try the other pastries they have
4
They serve a very nice cake and pastry. I can taste a natural flavour of a good quality ingredient. The texture of the Luna de Miel is very smooth and delicate. They make a very good sweet pastry. They also serve tea which goes well with each type of cake that they have. Staff have a good knowlegde about their product, they can explain and give a good information about each type of cake to the customer. Very good

~I stumbled upon this place Mad About Sucre and did a double take before walking into the cozy shop~the cashier over the counter is an amazing server if you'd ever encounter one, this is as great. I'd asked to takeaway some slices of cakes, He'd asked if I was planning to travel more than 10mins with them and explains they don't travel well! I'd asked for one of everything and he spent time telling me what was in all of them while preparing my order, he shared which one should be eaten first in order of sweetness...~he took way too long pains to lovingly prep and pack each cake positioning them so they minimized movement inside the box and added ice packs to keep them cool~he also scooped some crushed nuts for once of them that should be added when served and thought me how to serve it~Here's the order we should eat them 1. Coco Citron, 2. Luna De Miel, 3. Le Camibi, 4. San DomingueTake a Look at the Photos~Look we unpacked them back in the office and the 4 looked gorgeous not to mention that a ground of 10 colleagues tasted and compared them with Antoinette's favorablyDefinitely worth a visit and takeaway if you can drive on fast outta there, it's in a really sunny part of town and they do not take credit cards, only Cash or NETS!~the cashier is James Tan and he "is" MAD About SUCRE, I got a VIP discount of 10% which negates the Service Charge because I ordered out so if you're not sitting inside do ask for it :

Ever since CanelÃ© shut down, been searching for a place with comparable cake. Came upon Made About Sucre on a local food blog, wasn't expecting much. First impression, very cute decor, good place for a lazy afternoon with a small group of friends. The guy behind the counter (unfortunately didn't get his name) was super enthusiastic, patient and gracious. Was one of the most 'into it' servers I've encountered in SG. He outlined that the owner didn't use preservatives, only raw cane sugar, and the thinking behind each dessert. We had the San Domingue (seemed very popular) and the Hummingbird. The Hummingbird was a true surprise, I normally dislike cake-with-fruit, but this was moist and not overwhelming, and not overly sweet. The server explained that each cake can be paired with a certain type of tea (the Hummingbird with a type of berry tea, I had the San Domingue with coffee). They don't do lattes/etc, but you can order milk on the side with the coffee. Two types of cake+tea+coffee came to ~SGD42. Will definitely come back to try the other options. They also do cake orders. There's a cute display in the cafe, a local designer (Shawn - who seems to be a kid, according to the website??), with mugs/tshirts/etc for sale. Will be cool if they feature other designers as well. The cafe only accepts cash+NETS, hope they do credit cards soon

Didn't dine in but ordered a cake. With three days before my event I had to take an off the shelf item. Fortunately it was Beauty and the Beast. Chocolate cake with a cream filling flavoured with Creme de cassis. The cream filling was delicious and light. The cake was denser than I normally like (akin to a Death by Chocolate consistency) but there is a raspberry sauce you can pour over to moisten it. Overall a delicious cake, good service. Price about $200 for a cake they said would feed 20 but actually fed more. Now if only they would fix their website and accept credit card payments....
5
A lovely and intimate 'cakery' set in a nice location. It's nice and clean and what makes it an excellent overall experience are most definitely the staff - they are all friendly, warm, welcoming and accommodating to your needs and requests and always seem bright and cheerful. The place has a nice up beat vibe and generally a good feel. The fact that they can come up with items so amazing and creative is ming boggling! .....and they use no artificial flavours - Brilliant!If you're looking for something tailor made to celebrate or mark a mega occassion and create a BANG then these are the guys to reach out to! Great cakes and treats at good value - it is definitely well worth a visit to really indulge and dig in with that sweet tooth
5
The nicest and friendliest cake shop ive been to. The cakes and savouries are of excellent quality and beautiful presentation. But the real accolades are for the staff, so sweet, helpful and genuinely charming. Best place to indulge if you have sweet tooth and a must try out if you are living/ or visiting Singapore

I had the loveliest time at Mad About Sucre tonight. As a lover of tea and cakes, Mad About Sucre has successfully married the two with their dessert degustation, which served 7 types of cakes, each with a paired tea. The owners welcomed us warmly when we arrived and told us their concept of a modern French patisserie and their story of how they've only been in business for a few months. They also told us their inspiration for the cakes and where the main ingredients (all organic and fairtrade) came from.The French style cakes were lovely. Though cream and cheese based, they were light and creamy and were subtle in their flavour. Ironically, the pair who own the shop were judicious with cutting down sugar in their recipes, resulting in flavourful desserts more suited to adult palates. There was one British-style chocolate sponge cake that was a bit 'meh' after a line of delightful cakes.Each cake was then paired with an exotic organic fairtrade tea. There was Morrocan Rose, Cambodian Chamomile, Spanish Orange and French Apple, to name a few. As it was evening time, they had thoughtfully arranged for a line up of caffeine-free teas. Try the tea before and after the desserts and you'll find the teas taste bolder and far more fragrant than they were.Love the modern French style decor, and the spacious seating that allows you privacy with your friends. The furniture is very comfortable too. Service was excellent and prompt and all ten of us had a great time and found it great value for money (about $20/each for this experience). Would visit again
5
It was a great experience to be able to sample such fine & creative cakes as well as wonderful tea to pair with each individual cake. The owners patiently explained the product composition of each cake & the type of tea that they are recommending to go along with
5
Recommended by a friend to meet there for tea. The ambience is good . V comfortable. V unique cakes and tea. V fine hand made cakes. Enjoyed it very much. Will be back again
3
Just opposite my hotel was a sleek looking pastry shop nicely designed talked to great lengths about the cakes but seemed to be offended i did not share his same opinion cold service after that if you cant take honest feedback dont ask for it
5
God gives special talent to the lady chef.
She made not only a piece of cake but a piece of art.
We enjoyed the cakes with all sences. Thank you for giving us a unique afternoon.
4
Exquisite, well-thought out desserts paired with tea. The service staff were attentive and friendly, perhaps a little overzealous as my partner and I would have appreciated if they left us with a little more privacy and less banter.
Well worth a visit!
5
Wanted to explore this place's pretty treats whilst visiting family in Singapore as I have heard so much about MadAboutSucre. Despite little choices when I went, the cake I had was light & delicious whilst the tea made up by one of the owners was so tasty. Made my afternoon. and the owners were so friendly & hospitable
1
Came here based on TripAdvisor's good review. Cakes were pretty to looked but lacked taste. Coffee was terrible. I hv tried many coffee places in that area, lokal, papa San, DOC.. Etc n this place serves the worst coffee!! There is absolutely no care in making a gd cup of coffee or have the knowledge to. You can tell immediately when the coffee arrived with barely any character. Totally limpy n way too acidic. Even Oriel, which I blasted about its acidic coffee n complain to the staf ( I rarely complain) in hindsight made me a better coffee than this Sucre place. Disappointing!! A pretty place with all the fluff but no substance.. Can't understand how the other reviewers can gv this place a 5 pointers... All reviewers are their friends, perhaps?? Must avoid this place if you are a true coffee drinker...
4
We stumbled upon this cafe and liked how pretty the pastries looked. The taste didn't disappoint either! We also tried their recommended tea and dessert pairing, which I must really commend as they went well together. Service was impeccable, and we'd come back again if only they have more variety of options and was a little more cosy. The place feels a little cold right now
2
Have seen many instagram posts on their beautiful cakes, and decided to try it. They tasted average, and for me the cakes looked better than what it delivered on the flavours. There are many cake/pastry shops in Singapore and unfortunately Mad About Sucre fell short of expectations given the hype.And the reviews by other diners here gave me false hope, making me question their legitimacy
5
Amazing experience with some outstanding pastries that look and taste awesome paired with some custom made teas blended each day.Take time to savour the experience and enjoy the paired pastry and tea. Better still if you can go with a bunch of friends as you can taste all option

I was charmed by its whimsical decor - remniscent of a Parisian tea salon - from the moment we stepped in. Service was enthusiastic; the service staff (or possibly owners?) took great pains to explain to us their ethos, the concept behind each exquisite cake, and the best way to eat them.The cakes here at Mad About Sucre are all handcrafted on site using organic flour and raw unbleached sugar, and eschews the use of pre-mixes and artificial flavourings. We ordered 3 cakes, and were advised to eat them in a specific order - from light to rich.Moulin Rouge - Smooth and smoky caramel mousse with a walnut parfait core.The cakes we tried in this order:1) Moulin Rouge - A light and slightly smoky caramel mousse with a walnut parfait core. This was pleasant and unbelievably smooth. A good way to open up the appetite for more of their tasty creations.2) Coco Citron - This was my favourite of the lot. Creamy coconut mousse was given a little zest with lemon curd, and it was perched on a coconut sablÃ©e tart which gave it an added crunchy texture.3) San Domingue - This was a sight to behold and a treat for the tastebuds. Each ingredient was beautiful on its own, and the sum of its parts - magical. Presented in the form of a glossy sphere of 70% single origin dark chocolate mousse, this was juxtaposed with a core of caramelised plaintain cream and buttery brittany crunch. The jewel box on top is a dark chocolate square that bursts with rum liqueur once it's
5
Never had I experienced such an intimate and fantastic experience in a cafe. I was transported to another continent when I entered Mad About Sucre! A truly authentically designed pâtisserie right here in the heart of Singapore.
5
This European Cakery specializes in customizing handcrafted wedding, birthday and celebratory cake with 20-60% of their sweetness level. Their cakes are LEGIT and freshly baked. Definitely great for my diabetes friends
5
I couldn’t believe it myself but seriously this is a place that will make you feel ‘MAD’ about desserts. The cakes are created like art pieces that make me feel guilty for cutting them apart and the taste is phenomenal. I still remember the first bite of the signature cake “San Domingue” which sparkled in my month and left a long-lasting aftertaste. If you are in Singapore, this is a must-go place to enjoy lovely cakes, chill out and relax. You will definitely miss the cakes here after you return home. I travel to many places and I love eating dessert, the cakes at this place is really exceptional and I will recommend it to all my friends who are planning to visit Singapore. It's an amazing place not to miss in Singapore

There are many cafes in Singapore but Mad About Sucre is one of the rare few that is both serious about their cakes as well as their customers' experience.Each of their creations is distinctively unique and specifically prepared to 'wow' your tastebuds. My personal favorite is the Passionne, which is a light cheesecake paired with refreshing Passionfruit and yummylicious Coco nip crunch. For the dark chocolate lovers, San Domingue is a must try!!To top it all, their service is world class and they will do their utmost to ensure you are well taken of.Definitely a MUST visit when in Singapore...I am utterly in love and Mad about Sucre

I totally enjoyed a lazy and self-indulgent Saturday afternoon at MadAboutSucre 2 days ago during a short trip to Singapore. The cakes, wisely paired with various types of tea, were scrumptious and beautifully designed. Every single piece looked humble and unpretentious, yet the taste was elaborate and luscious. The shop has a great decor, is spacious yet intimate, and provides many spots for your perfect selfies! The service was impeccable. Eric and James, co-owners, were very personable and attentive to every single customer and were knowledgeable about their products. The shop is easily accessed by MRT and only a few stops away from Orchard. As a tourist, when you are tired of the heat, the crowd, and the shopping of Orchard, you can come to MadAboutSucre, rest your feet, cool yourself off, and enjoy a piece of bliss on plate

The service in this café is definitely 1st class. Apart from the warm welcome, you are properly introduced to the cakes you have ordered which are all a piece of art, that really sets them apart.My personal favorite is Passione (passionfruit cheesecake) which is also well loved by my 7 year old. The flavor just lingers and if you eat it with the accompanying condiment, it further complements it and changes the taste! I can somewhat taste it now while writing this review. :) The other dessert which surprises me is their Coco Citron (lemon tart) a mix of flavor between coconut cream and lemon which is so well balanced that I can finish the whole thing by myself. The best part of this all is that their desserts are with reduced sugar which is great for the health conscious and children! Do also make sure that you order a pot of their tea which is personally blended by the owners to pair with your dessert. It is well balanced and do enhance the entire experience in the café. I am already planning my next visit

the desserts served at sucre tasted as good as it looks. the dessert is not ridiculously sweet like the ones served outside - so it is perfect for ladies who have sweet tooth but yet conscious about their weight (like me). the cakes are all carefully and lovingly crafted, and they all look so perfect i thought they were displays. the desserts are so good that this table of 4 friends sitting behind me actually ordered 11 plates of desserts - no kidding. the staff are ever so friendly and they make you feel absolutely welcome

This San Dominguez - mousse made from 70% single origin chocolate, Rum Jewel Box, Caramelized Plantain Vanilla Cream, Brittany crunch... is simply really awesome. The taste is very much layered, so much taste in just spoonful. The mousse is that not light like those you usually experience out there. The servers, I believe are the owners themselves, briefed me what I am to partake like a Michelin chef would to passionately go through the ingredients and how the cakes are being baked.Definitely a "MUST" place to visit if you enjoy cakes. No worries if you are not driving. The Outram Mrt station is just a stone throw away

A feast for the senses the minute you step into the place. Though undeniably posh, you can't help but feel at home here with the friendly, personal service. The cakes are totally decadent, and well worth ditching your diet for. My fave - the Coco Citron, or was it the Passione, or the San Domingue? I loved them all! Come with a group of mates, so that you can taste everything without looking like a complete glutton. Best thing, they serve bespoke teas that are so so delicate and the perfect complement to the cakes. The team here will lovingly help you pair the teas with the cakes if you ask them nicely :

From the 1st moment you step into the cafe, you feel completely welcomed and at home by the owners eric and james. But they're not the stars - the cakes are!! My favourite was San Dominique. This is definitely a piece of art, executed to the very best by chef Lena with nothing but the best ingredients. A must try for all chocolate lovers
