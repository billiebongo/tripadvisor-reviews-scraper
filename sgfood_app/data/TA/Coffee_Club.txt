A nice coffee shop with excellent service and a fair choice of snacks and food. My friend had waffles with syrup and cream I had coffee and some cake and was enjoyable. Plenty of seats and a good place to relax.

We stopped here for a quick lunch. The Coffee "iced" was like a milkshake (very good). Mango Soda was very good. Salmon w/ wasabe excellent. Chicken nachos didn't seem to have any chicken! Very small portions on nachos. Overall food and service were good.

Wondered into this coffee shop as the mall was winding down. Despite this they sold us a great coffee and a very tasty lobster bisque. Cakes were half price too as the day was winding down.

Great place to have a coffee and/or lunch. Set in the Marina Square, there is a large seating area and a good choice of dishes. Staff are friendly and efficient and the food is of a good quality.

This Coffee Club Restaurant is located at Harbourfront Centre. (Nearest MRT is Harbourfront Station) Located at a lonely corner, behind Bread Talk Bakery on Level 1. Free WiFi. Helpful friend waiters and waitresses. They do not have a good selection of cooked food.Clean cosy place to chill with few friends over drinks and dessert. Love to eat the mudpie here. Thick chocolate and coffee ice cream. Tastefully good.Enjoyed the simple dessert. Can come again.

Did someone say coffee maple syrup???? Yessss!!!! A huge stack of waffles with scrambled eggs and bacon, with butter on top melting through the waffles. And then the glorious coffee maple bottle appears. Soo goood for your tastebuds and soo bad for your heart. What better way to start your morning with a caffeine kick - try their frozen espresso latte. These were two of the recommended coffee club specials, and they met my every expectation

The ambience of this café is actually not bad, considering how it is located at one corner of the first floor of Harbourfront Centre, which makes this café a good place to avoid the crowds. When we entered the café, we were greeted rather warmly by the staff as well.One thing that was particularly memorable was how they served my parents warm water and served me cold water, which I thought was a rather thoughtful gesture. The food, however, was not up to standard. We ordered a Chili Crab Linguine, Fish N Chips, Slipper Lobster Linguine and Muddy Mud Pie. The crab in the Chili Crab Linguine, the fish in the Fish N Chips and the slipper lobster in the Slipper Lobster Linguine were not fresh at all, and you could easily tell they were taken out of the freezer. The taste was very, very average and was definitely not worth the slightly higher price compared to other restaurants. The only thing that was commendable was the tartar sauce for the Fish N Chips. It was a rather disappointing visit to this restaurant in general, and I am unlikely to return
