The taste of the dishes are excellent, the serving portion is good for sharing. However, the service need to improve, kind of not attentive and shortage of manpower.

The food is great. Lots of seatings available. A little expensive but is worth trying. Kids are okay to dine in too as they have non spicy options.

Apparently done by the same people who run MaoCai on Mosque Street.
This is a bit more refined though, quieter and not so cramped.
Will come back to try this again.

But somehow they ran out of it when we tried to order the 2nd round. It was 730pm and not full house, why so?

Nice ambience with really spicy and fresh mala fish. The new side dishes like pan fried dumpling turned out to be deep fried instead and we didn't like it. Different from picture too.

Since discovering this restaurant in June, I have returned almost every month for the spicy, numbing (numbingly spicy?) dishes! If it's your first visit, be sure to check out the 花椒魚 and 辣子雞.

Good Sichuan restaurant - but go only if you can take the spiciness! The restaurant looks quite simple, good for friends/family gatherings or coworkers. More expensive than other similar restaurants few streets down the road in Chinatown, but still reasonable. The hot pot is good although there was not much explanation on the ingredients and the top up ingredients. The sticks appetizers look good in photos but wasn't very tasty

I guess this place comes down to a simple question - how much do you like really spicy mouth-burning food? if you do then this is a great choice but if you don't you will be miserable. I was taken here by a friend and was not warned in advance and I found the meal a real challenge. What i didnt like on top of the heavy use of hot peppers was the even heavier use of salt in some dishes. But the meal had some bright spots so it wasnt a total waste..

As a lover of Sichuan cuisine and the numbing effects of the peppers, I was disappointed in myself that I had forgotten about Si Wei Yan at the bottom of Club Street and when we walked in for lunch on Sunday afternoon, it appeared everyone else had forgotten about it as well as the place was completely empty....However after a look through the menu we selected a few classics chicken in dry chill, the boiled fish, sliced beef shank and a new one for me beef jerky...As soon as the beef jerky hit the table, the aroma of the Sichuan pepper immediately filled the room and we knew we were in for a treat, the rest of the dishes were excellent, lip/tongue numbing with great flavour. Definitely added to our list of go to again ( soon) restaurants and it wont be forgotten this time!
