Nice selection of Beers..Friendly & Great staff and an awesome Owner... Really enjoyed our evening and the beers are cold & fresh. The food menu that we had were mainly finger food which was ok to good... Overall a great experience on a warm evening

Just popped in had a couple of beers a few nights ago and decided to come back. Ordered Bratwurst and cane out not cooked to my liking having spent nearly 15 years in Germany. I have to say that the staff here are outstanding and also very pretty. They could not apologise enough for the food. Just because it was not to my liking does not mean it was not good. I would definitely recommend this place!

Being tired of the Asian Lagers I was in desperate need of a decent beer. WitBier came for the rescue. There is a nice bar, lots of outside seating, friendly staff, and most importantly, a good selection of draft and bottled beers. Job well done. Located just across the street from Happy Crab
