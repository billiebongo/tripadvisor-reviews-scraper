Great selection of Gin plus all other spirits. Nice atmosphere and cozy area to relax. Excellent presentation of drinks. Staff a bit short if too busy and can be expensive if drinking a few. But worth a visit. Service is excellent.

My husband and I went to Tonic Bar for cocktails. He had a specialty drink called Luminous (I think) and I had a Sapphire martini. The bar maid asked if I wanted a single martini or a double. I asked for a double. The martini came but was the size of a regular, single martini in a traditional martini glass. Not only that but the gin was so diluted I thought I was drinking water. After a "double" martini a person should feel a little intoxicated, but nothing at all. And I was charged SGD $40 for that! I tasted my husband's drink and it just tasted very sweet, also no indication of any alcohol

Selection of gin was very good, recommend by one of my friend. Well premium products you can get in any five star hotel however people make the place. Very rude and disrespectful staff, might they don’t know customer service or they don’t need business. Forget the guy name was in Suit so egoistic.. Guys learn customer service and don’t judge people by there appearance. Management people should wake up before it’s too late.

Great little library type bar in the JW Marriott. Really welcoming staff who make proper cocktails but alao provide good recommendations. Very nice small place to chill and hang out. Definitely recommend. Only drawback is very limited food selection... only 5 items from room service menu that can be ordered at the bar seems ridiculous for a hotel.

The service is sort of slow in here but the gin options are really great. We really liked the grapefruit Gin and Tonic.

As a gin buff, Tonic proves to be a gin-lover's paradise. With an eclectic array of gin choices, this bar will not bore you out. Discovered an asian gin there, Iron Ball Gin from Thailand. Well, definitely takes balls to carry such a selection

Navin is the heart and soul of Tonic bar,making every guest feels comfortable and at home! He is the reason we keep coming back to the same place, over and over again. Thank you Navin, for being a great host

Located in the JW Marriott, this is an awesome little bar. Excellent bartenders who can make a proper drink (and recommend the perfect way to make it). Very chill and relaxed library setting that is cozy and smartly decorated. Good selection but the best part is the genuinely great service

We only had one drink but the selection was great. It was happy hour and so we tried the English gin and tonic (with rosenary). Very earthy but very good

Been there a few times and I seem to come away each time a little less enthused than the time prior...hence this will be my last time there, too many other options in SingaporeNo question a great selection. However, the 2 sips I get with each serving, those that are completely inundated with ice, really leave my wondering why I then have to pay such a ridiculous amount when the bill shows up. Portions have definitely gotten smaller, and the bartender who could not quit coughing in and around my drink whilst preparing on this last occasion have convinced me that I must move on. So much potential here, but clearly not a priority for the property

Just stopped in for drinks. Great place to meet friends or share a drink with your best friend. Did not sample the menu. But great staff, friendly and helpful in choosing the right gin and tonic mix.

My husband loves Gin and Tonics and this place did not disappoint.The ladies behind the bar were also very friendly and if you are there close to closing, you might get to try the "experimentation": drink of that day.

Very cosy bar with an amazing choice of gin. We tried a very tasty German gin. Nice and gentle staff knowing a lot about gin.

Without question, the most inhospitable bar in Singapore! After an unforgettable dinner at Garibaldi, we swung by the JW Marriott for a nightcap. The nice people at the lobby desk informed us that it was approaching closing time, but that we were well within the "last call" window at Tonic. This cozy and eccentric concept bar features juniper berry-based cocktails made with gins from all over the globe. The comfy little den-like room with quirky chandeliers and a faux fireplace would be the perfect place for an after dinner tipple if only the staff were the least big welcoming. When we entered we met with a grimace and sternly warned that the bar would soon be closing. As soon as we sat down, we were expected to order (without so much as perusing the extensive drink menu). The bill was delivered immediately after the drinks. And twice thereafter we were reminded it would soon be time to leave. If I'd wanted to slam my drink, I would've ordered a round of shots and not a single malt scotch. The bartenders were so ill-behaved I almost expected them to turn on flood lights and blast Semitonic's "Closing Time" . . . though they achieved the same effect with their frosty glares. We left before they came to pry the glasses from our hands. Fortunately, our clothes did not turn into rags, nor did our Grab car metamorphose into a pumpkin

On the ground floor of the JW Marriott Hotel, a small and quiet bar with premium selection of Spirits and Wines. Recommend the selection of Single Malt

What an amazing way to be opened up the the incredible range of top quality gin. The staff are very knowledgable and the service was excellent. Tonic is an intimate environment that ticks all the late night boxes

We visited Tonic as we were staying in the hotel. The bar is nice I love the big marble bar and the other table chairs and fake fire somehow doesn't nail it. Not sure what they are trying to achieve. Gin menu is extensive and they know their Gins which you expect. The only feedback is when I was offered a second drink the lady serving was almost talking over me about what my choice should be. I had to ask her to wait and let me think. She was lovely just the same.One of the other ladies was terrific and helped take a few photos of me and my family.If you are staying at the J W Marriott you should pop in for a Gin

I had high hopes for Tonic with such a great selection of gins. The bar itself is small, but lacks any real ambience. Just feels like another hotel bar. Kudos to the staff for knowing their gins and which tonics go best with them, but the whole experience was uninspiring. Disappointed that the website showed a menu with bar food (which sounded great), but we were informed when we arrived that no food was served at Tonic. If you're a lover of gin, head to Atlas bar instead

Great selection of gin, great atmosphere, very cosy. The manager Jessica was very friendly and helpful with getting me a drink. Thoroughly enjoyed my few rounds of gin. Will certainly visit again soon

A tad pricey at $30 a pop on the average for their signature g&t selection. But the wide choice of gins and tonics is a plus. It was a quiet weekday evening when I went and great if you want to catch up with friends with a drink.
