Decided to dine here as we haven’t tried this outlet before. Nice, I personally liked it as it more conducive then the loud neighbour. Great lunch! The burgers were small but very juicy!

Dropped in on a week night for chocolate cake and red wine! Comfortable dinning with helpful staff. Good wine selection and their cakes are great to share!

I used to love to order pancakes from here but recently they changed the portion size to about half, while keeping the price the same. I was really upset to pay $25 for half the pancakes that I used to get.

Went there had dinner at three days ago. Staff are very attentive and working by eyes. Good product knowledge and good service. Nice.

I love this place especially for brunch, the staff are very courteous and the atmosphere is pleasant. It's a great place to go and I can even bring my dog.
I haven't found many restaurants that are as good as this one in this area.

Great food, good ambience and service! Decent place for an enjoyable regular meal, enough choice on menu for everyone.

We love PS cafe have visited few outlets. We like this one because it's quite even though close to main area and food. We love ginger pudding, we keep going back for it.

ChopSuey is also PS Cafe and having been to Dempsey Hill went to Martin Road. Both restaurants (putting aside the setting as prefer Dempsey) offer excellent service and present food that is so tasty; yes they have created the recipe for success. San Choy Pau (lettuce cups) is very good

I would like to comment on the 2 staff ,Sue and Chris @ the PS Cafe Martin 38. Me and my partner had dinner here on the 6/1/2018 when a very unfortunate event happened. One of the service staff accidentally trip on the carpet and the chilli oil condiments that she was holding, spilled all over the back of my shorts and soaked all the way thru. Sue immediately came over to help me when she saw what had happened. She changed our seats, walked me to the bathroom, helped me clean up and even took my clothes to the laundromat after giving me a staffâ€™s shorts to wear. Chris offered to get me a new set of fresh food as my food had turn cold by the time I got back. Sue came back all sweaty from the trip to the laundromat and was very apologetic that my clothes could only be cleaned by Thursday. She and Chris invited us back to collect and have dinner @ Martin place 38. I would like to take the chance to sincerely thank them for showing me such impeccable service. PS CAFE should be very proud to have staff that go such great length! The food portion was amazing full of flavors. MUST TRY THE CHILLI SOFT SHELL CRAB

Great spot for a lunch with cocktail, glass of wine or coffee. The food was good - well presented, tasty and good serving size. Timing was a bit out with two of our three meals arriving after about 10 minutes, then a further 15 minute wait for the PS Burger with no explanation for the delay. Staff were friendly and attentive. It was busy with a pretty even mix of local and expats. Glad we'd booked ahead as I think we would have had a wait for the table

However the food is disappointing. I'm not sure how a simple sandwich can be so average at this upmarket joint. Try the pizza they are good

So the wonderful concept behind this restaurant is that there is a PS Cafe and a ChopSuey and both of these are connected - so one can order food from PS Cafe or Chop Suey. I liked the brocolli at Chop Suey and the I really like the pasta and the lamb dish that I ordered from PS Cafe. Best of both worlds

Went in here after gym session. It was already 9pm , the staff were friendly in recommending food to fuel my tummy after an intense workout! Ordered the thai bowl and seafood chower. Seafood chowder was yummy . However the thai bowl was not so worth my money. It was highend pad kra pow kai! Meaning thai basil chicken which is a typical street food in thailand. The presentation was pretty but does not warrant this price ta

Stumbling across this cafe is most probably one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. I went there for a dinner with my boyfriend and the ambience made it all so romantic. The service staffs were friendly and the food was equivalently delicious. One of the service staff, Sarah actually recommended us their vegetarian pizza that was one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Overall, we had such a fantastic dining experience and definitely will go back for seconds

Thai chicken Brunch. Simply delicious. Had also a kiwi juice with other fruits. Awesome as well. All for 31sgd, maybe a bit pricy, but nice staff, quick and good taste

Waiting for full 30 mins, nothing happened at all, no server attended us, when we finally got one she was too busy and said will come back.. Never came back for other 15mins. Talked to the supervisor / manager and was abandoned again at once while he fled to the cashier to settle problem with other customer. Ordered for second time, at this time we waned just coffee and that's it, but it's still not coming. 30 mins wasted on their pavement. Finally moved to their next door coffee shop Reading Room and we are happy campers. Please don't come here even though they're one of the few that open on PH. Service is non existent, which reminded us to our last visit, it was exactly the same case. Waited forever for water, being served only one water whereas we were two. Waited again for cakes, being served both cakes not at the same time. Btw the cakes look very salivating but none that we tried are even good enough.Good coffee, subpar cakes and WORST service, do not come here

This place is quite thigh near to Clarke quay. We like food especially ginger pudding, we keep going back for it

Singapore is strict ok drink-driving. Love this place where you can try many types of wine in tasting sizes and stay within the legal limit on a night out when you are driving!

Catching up with an old friend, he suggested meeting at a new PS Café Petit on Martin St just close to Robertson Quay.It did not disappoint.The ambience was cool and relaxing for afternoon coffee.The key lime pie was yum.The espresso was brewed beautifully.Overall, a great spot to hang out, enjoy some good company and good food and drink

We ordered a asian salad, a burger and a steak sandwich. We requested that one of the orders be served with truffle fries. The food was good although the asian salad was tiny. We ordered them all as mains but the salad arrived very quickly and it took another 25 minutes for the rest of the food to arrive - this is despite the restaurant being 25% full. When we received the bill we learnt that there was a supplement for the truffle fries which we weren't advised earlier. We were also double charged for one of the items.

Ps cafe is an amazing franchise in Singapore. Food quality and ambience is great for the price they charge but this branch is the worse of the lot. Somehow their burger, fries, coffee and pasta has a large variance from it s other branches like Dempsey and Club street. Highly recommend other pa cafe branches but if u have decided to come here.. skip the burgers .. they are expensive and not worth the experience.

We love PS Cafe and ChopSuey at Martin Road because you can get 2 kinds of cuisine - Chinese and Western and we love the decor and setting which is modern, clean and inviting. Service is excellent. The wait can get long only because they're short staffed but it's a opportunity to try their special range of gins, whiskeys and wines. Highly recommended

I really enjoy the pizzas from this place and I live opposite the Martin Road restaurant, two minutes' walk away. Unfortunately I had a very bad ordering experience there a couple of years ago which put me off going for a long while. I placed a phone order and was told it would be ready for delivery in 20 minutes. When I arrived they told me it would be another fifteen minutes. I suspected that they hadn't passed through my order to the kitchen but the waitress said that wasn't the case. I went for a fifteen minute stroll around the block but when I came back the waitress again told me I would have to wait another fifteen minutes which eventually stretched out to twenty. I sat and waited, and when I left I complained about the poor service. I got no acknowledgement of my complaint, no expression of regret or an apology. As I left with my luke-warm and dry pizza, I noticed that the waitress I had complained to was was chatting with the cashier, pointing over to me and they were having a giggle. I emailed the company with a complaint and didn't go back. This was back in mid-2014. Earlier this year some friends who were round at my place wanted to order pizzas from there so I reluctantly phoned through an order. At that time my call went straight through to the restaurant itself. When I went to pick the pizzas up I noticed that the staff had changed and that it was now table service. The pizzas arrived on time and were good quality. I was pleasantly surprised and thought that things had obviously changed. However, there now seems to be a general order service taking orders for all of the Singapore branches as they now ask you which restaurant you're going to collect from. On the last two occasions I have gone down after the given wait times, I have had to wait for a further ten minutes. Tonight I was told the wait time would be fifteen to twenty minutes when I phoned up so I left it for twenty-five minutes. When I arrived they looked surprised as they hadn't even received my order which they said would take fifteen minutes. Again there was no attempt at customer retention, no offer of a drink or any other kinds of hospitality if I wanted to wait. I told them not to bother making the pizza and left. I phoned the order service back to complain but I suspect I won't hear back from them. All in all, over the years my experience of the service at all branches of the PS Cafe has not been that positive. Service tends to range from average to indifferent to poor, and, in some cases, clueless. Despite the fact that they do serve some good food, I won't be returning any time soon

My first time here was with my colleagues for lunch. There were 5 of us and we sampled pizza, pasta, ugly fried chicken, Asian salad and a panini. My colleagues all agree that the food was good and the portions ample. The only thing was the waiter mistook my ice latte for latte but he corrected that politely. Therefore, I decided to bring my husband here for dinner and he was very pleased with the ambience and food. I did feel that the service is a tad slow but other than that my husband enjoyed his nasi goreng and I had a grilled chicken panini with a side of mushroom soup. I love the panini but it was too much for me. The mushroom soup is quite small (for a $6 top up) and I found it a bit bland but that could be subjective. Overall for the 2 of us, we paid about S$50+ with no beverages. Would recommend to most due to the variety, tastiness of the food and the ambience, but do note the slightly longer waiting time for food to be served. Would come back in the future!

It took 25+ minutes just to order my food and another 40+ minutes for the food to come out - long after the tables around me had gotten theirs. It had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp as it was soggy and lukewarm. I asked for another glass of wine and they brought me two more, 5 minutes apart. I asked for more water, it never came. I asked to order and they said sorry, someone else had to do that.. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be in training and nobody was in charge / knew what they were doing. I finally had to go up at the end to pay because it was clear I was never going to be waited on for the bill. My experience may have had something to do with sitting outside as the guy beside me had similar issues and left for another restaurant as well. Won't be back for awhile!

My fifth visit, all this while the foods standard is consisten, however this time round service is a little lacking so is the ugly chicken. Pizza was ok. We had rum and raisin ice cream while scooping , the second scoop turns watery, freezer has problem. They should checked and not offered if it's melting

Food is good. Had a vegetarian pasta with a lot of vegetables and Parmesan cheese. Delicious! My husband had the Smokey mozzarella pizza. He loves this one. Had it several times. Service depends on the waiters of that day. We had very kind waiters but also some that didn't know what a smile is.The cakes are quite expensive.The atmosphere is good. Nice place to sit
