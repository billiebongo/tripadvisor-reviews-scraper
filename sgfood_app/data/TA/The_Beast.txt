Small but warm restaurant, thoughtful staff helped to serve the surprise bouquet and we received a small gift from them after we finished our meal as a valentines day gift. Good food at reasonable price.
4
Short staffed on a weekend but they tried their best ... really enjoyed the food and will be back to try more! Please don’t ask to clear my plates when there’s still so much food? Thanks!
5
great place to unwind and chill after work. portion of the food was big enough to share. highly recommended!
4
I do like this place . I wanna come back someday.
Hope they will increase their service to be better
4
We had a really nice family meal here. Was in an area I’ve not been to before and quite a nice are off the beaten track. Had hoped for some ribs but weren’t on offer. Chose the chicken. Wife had pulled pork, which for me, was the slightly better choice. It’s not a big place so if want a table inside, definitely recommend booking. Would imagine decent atmosphere at night
4
Having followed this particular establishment on Facebook for a number of years, I finally managed to pay the team a visit and try their fare.The menu selection is really good with a varied selection that should satisfy the more fussy of eaters outthere.  I took a stab at the aptly named DIYBrunch offering. My order was Pulled Pork, mash n gravy, creamy scrambled eggs, Ceasers Salad, sausage gravy, washed down with Cold Miller draft. It sounds like a lot of food however the portion was just right, the pulled pork was the star! You could tell there was a lot of time put into the preparation and the slow cooking done to perfection.I would highly recommend this establishment to all visitors in Singapore

A good southern american bourbon bar, playing classic rock and roll with good southern fried chicken. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, chilled and cool. the service is average and could be more attentive, but that just plays with the "cool" vibe of the place. I had the soutern fried chicken (about half a chicken in total) which was nice and juicy, though a little oily. All in all a really cool and funky bourbon bar with above average food. A nice place to hang out for a while and just chill
4
Ordered the DIY Brunch (fried chicken, waffles, watermelon and vanilla maple sauce) and also the pulled pork hash. Everything was pretty good, the waffles in particular were very fluffy! We sat at the al fresco area since it was so cool and the ambience was great
4
My fav here was always the 3P burger because no other place could do a better job other than here. However to my disappointment, the standard seems to have differed from the usual. The pork was slightly tough and candied bacon was not very much candied with just a slight coating of sugar. Probably they were just very busy during the dinner crowd? Nevertheless, enjoyed their happy hour with alcohols for just $7++
3
So if you want a great selection of bourbon, this is the place. For the fried chicken, which seems to be a specialty, I'd pass especially if you're thinking along the lines of Southern Fried Chicken. They did make a great cream gravy. Didn't love the cheese goo on the fries. It was ok but I wouldn't go back. So my experience was good service but food was not something I could recommend
4
Nice ambience, food was good and value. Not expensive. Definitely worth another visit with my family
4
Good place for friends meetup or to unwind after work or to seek comfort food. Food is great with a good happy hour promotion. Will definitely return!
4
The food was pretty decent. Loved the chicken and waffles (portion was huge), corn bread and pork belly.
Happy hour drinks were great too! however thought the selection could be better!
5
The ambience was great and conveniently located in Bugis. Finally got to try the much talked about fried chicken waffles and it didn't disappoint.
3
The meat was good, the catfish less. Little pricy. Very fast and friendly service. Busy, windy and dark ambiance outside.
5
Food was good, had their Mac & Cheese burger and Chicken Waffles. The burger could be better if a stronger cheese is used. Apart from that, The atmosphere and the music were great!!
4
Not crowded on a friday night which qas surprising. Food was good. Service alright. Did not take pictures.. bt nice food.. can go again.
4
I made a reservation for 4, and when we arrived, an odd combination of 2 circular tables, with all of the seats facing a wall had been set up. We chose to move outside. The waitress didn't give us any sort of explanation of specials for the night, she didn't really speak to us at all. We ordered food and drinks which were all tasty, but then found out at the end of the meal that we had missed out on the all-you-can-eat chicken special. We had to flag down the waitress many times to order, and were treated like an inconvenience or like we were in the way. Overall, the southern food was very good, but the southern hospitality could use some work
4
Thanks to entertainer, it was more worthwhile to go down. Food was pretty good in terms of flavour and portion, will go back again to try the chicken waffles. Definitely worth getting going during happy hour (5-8pm) as the selection for their house pours were considerably better than other places (had the whisky and beer)Overall a pleasant experience but the live music at 8pm on a Friday in the enclosed environment did not do much to elevate it.
2
was advised that entertainer is only applicable for mains which is only available for dinner. So there was nothing available for lunchtime on sun. Pretty ridiculous. First time experiencing this. Tried their brunch but dint find anything good, mediocre at best.Biscuit was dry, gravy was salty, below average scrambled eggs, tough sausage patty, soggy matchstick fries. The only ok item was the sunny side up
5
The food was delicious and the staff are very helpful. I enjoyed the time I spent at The Beast. The bathroom facilities are near the eating area and there is no privacy between male and female toilets.
5
The music is amazing. I love the vibes of the place. The food was delectable. The fried chicken was really tender. And the beef patty for the Mac and Cheese burger was well marinated!
4
Tried the fried chicken waffle and it was not bad! Although on the pricy side. Felt that the waffle was too airy though.
3
The beast is situated near Arab street , ambience is ok, with average food ...
Only thing good bout this place is Its situated near Bugis street ...
Enjoy the shopping
4
A nice experience find with tasty food. Quiet lunch but looking forward to going back in an evening to sample the atmosphere as well as their collection of bourbons.
5
Service crew were extremely pleasant and helpful! Loved the music by the live band as well, perfect ambience for chilling out. Food was not bad too, would definitely visit again!
4
Tried the Nasi Lemak burger with spam fries. Unique interpretation of local food.
The fried chicken and waffles were good too!
2
We had our dinner here after reading good review from google. And I am quite disappointed with food. I ordered the Southern Fried chicken, taste normal and I think KFC is better. My friend ordered the Pork collar and the pork is too tough. Overall the food are average
1
We made reservations in the afternoon for 6 and arrived on time there. We were told to sit at the table outside the restaurant next to the road even though there were 2 big empty tables on the 2nd floor.The noise and dust from the road was terrible plus the cigarette smoke was blowing in our direction from the smoker's tables nearby. The food came and pulled pork burger was too dry whie the beef burger had a patty that had a lot of fillers and you could not taste any meat at all.We also ordered the oysters and as it just baked with so much cheese you cannot taste anything else. My son at home would have done a better job. When the bill came, we had some qustions and instead of explaining politel, the manager (he told me his name was DAZ) told me to go ahead and make a complain if I'm not happy!
3
1 of the female service staff was very impatient when comes to ordering and when she brought the wrong order over, she gave that frustrated look and made an unnecessary comment.When we asked for more serving plates and drinking water, they came after reminders (took about 15mins)
3
Friends and I did have disappointments towards the food even with the signature fried chicken waffles. We ordered few coffees and ended up at another coffee place to fill up the dissatisfaction.
4
Had a monster of a meal with the guys. The decadent nasi lemak burger, paired with a pint of beer, was a panacea for a long week. Equally unforgettable was the amazing music set that accompanied dinner!
3
We ordered the nasi lemak burger and pandan waffles and a few other mains. The nasi lemak burger was great, despite not being a fan of nasi lemak. Kudos! Service was pretty slow on that particular night though
3
Nasi lemak burger was good especially the sambal sauce, it went very well with the chicken. However, the fries were disappointing. Was expecting the same shiok level from artbox but it wasn't even close. Overall, good dining place with generous serving! Thumbs up!
4
Nice atmosphere and a good place to chill out. The beast burger is huge and we order it to share for a party of 4. Something special n nice to try
Other dishes are nice and average variety of cocktails and beer
4
for the month of august, check out the nasi lemak burger and salted egg fried chicken w/ pandan waffles. warning! huge portion. happy hour ($7) till 8pm
4
very limited menu, but for the menu they have, it was well prepared and great flavor mix.
the chicken waffles was great, but they could improve with the syrup. it was too buttery to my taste and not much maple flavor.
3
Food was good but staff looked super unfriendly/ unapproachable. Not really a brunch place. Atmosphere would probably be more lively at night. But the toilet stank and the toilet seat had urine stain on it.
3
Had a few drinks here one rainy night but be careful very expensive as is most of the alcohol in Singapor
4
Staff were attentive and food was not bad. tried the 3P burger, meat was flavourful and fries were addictive. Also had the Pandan waffle with salted egg chicken which was a special dish for the month of August. It was not too bad for a salted egg dish, however waffle was a bit dry. nevertheless, had a great meal and will be back for the normal fried chicken and waffle again
5
Server was attentive and jovial. The Birthday "cake" was good. Chicken with waffle was enjoyed by everyone
4
We had the Beast Caesar and Nasi Lemak Burger special. The Caesar salad was amazing with the poached egg! The Nasi Lemak Burger was tasty though it was a bit too much near the end. The ambience is dim and nice for a date!
4
D.I.Y. lunch is very great. Would definitely come back again for lunch or dinner. Would love to try the Nasi Lemak burger when I visit the next time.
4
The food here is quite worth the price paid. And also taste good. The mains usually have us stuffed. Best to go with a group of buddies so you can try the amazing starters too. Great atmosphere and music.
5
The Beast provides pretty good Southern fare at reasonable prices. Mac and Cheese and Fried Chicken were amazing! Buffalo wings could be even spicier. Will definitely be back for burgers and drinks.
5
Specializes in southern American food. Try the chicken and truffle fries and if you're up for it, the beast burger challenge. Very friendly staff!
3
We had crispy fried oyster as starter, a good choice to go with Weihenstephan beer follow by their Southern fried chicken(nicely fried though portion is on the small side) with sides of Mac & Cheese(be nicer if uses Macaroni instead of shell pasta) and Beast Caesar. Overall quite good meal, will return if craving for Southern Fried Chicken
3
Do take note if you want indoor seating, you have to book in advance clearly stating that you want to sit indoors. Was seated outdoors where there was a table that we noted smoking under the awning.There is service charge though you have to take the tap water yourself from the bar counter and they were not refilled when jugs were empty.Food was tasty though, the southern poutine and 3p burger and the chicken and waffle. Good food. There was also live music from around 8pm+ onwards
5
Very nice and cosy place. The easiest and faster way is to walk from Lavender MRT station (East West Line - Green color). It is about 5 mins walk from ICA building. There are outdoor (beside the roadside) and indoor seats. When going on weekends, be sure to make reservations as it is quite packed. Happy hour seems to be from 5-8pm. Recently they launch the Nasi Lemak burger for national day period. Ordered this and also the salted egg yolk chicken waffle. Both are really delicious but I feel that the burger is a little too spicy as I have not much tolerance for sambal chilli. The whole piece of chicken seems to be have been coated with the chilli. The coconut rice are a little strong but overall great. The salted egg yolk goes really well with the waffle. One of the best that I have eaten so far. Service of the staffs are great. Price of the food seems reasonable as the portion is really huge. Will definitely go back there again
2
We came with good expectations of the food, having seen great reviews. However, the subday brunch was mediocre at best, with small portions. The buttermilk biscuit was really dry. Service, sadly, did not make up for the poor food. The staff were talking at one corner and inattentive to our requests. Staff were not polite and attitude really needed improvement.
4
was seated hours and well placed fans kept us cool for the evening. enjoyed the food, especially the corn bread
4
We've dined here over 4 times now. The place always has delicious food.
Love the pork collar, roasted tomato soup and fried chicken.
4
Love their chicken & waffles very much! Very generous serving of southern fried chicken on freshly baked, super light and fluffy waffles!
service can get a little slow when it gets crowded and you're seated outside.
4
Food is good. Atmosphere is good. Service is good!
Love all the food which contain PORK! :)
nice place to chill.
And AFFORDABLE!
4
visited twice and i couldn't get pass their chicken waffles! generous portions of flavourful and crispy southern fried chicken on freshly baked, super light and fluffy waffles! highly recommend trying this. there's a few indoor seating on high stools with steel barrels table tops, which aren't exactly the most comfortable kind of seats you'll like to sit down and chill on. outdoor seatings are more comfy, but getting the attention of their staff indoor might be a little challenging, especially when it gets busy
5
Food was fantastic and portions were large. My only gripe would be the seating arrangement in the restaurant. The indoor seats were high chair seats and were not very comfortable; there were proper tables and chairs in the outdoor seating area, so that may be a better option if it was a cool day
5
I came here after having beers with some friends for more the same and some food. The beers were good but the food was absolutely delicious. The burger was juicy and succulent, the fries were very well seasoned and the whole thing promised a lot and did not disappoint. The menu is fairly simple with all the southern cuisine big hitters and by first impressions this is a definite spot to try when you are in that sort of mood. Will definitely return
4
Make a stop here just about every time I come to Singapore. Some of the best and most satisfying food you'll be able to find in town. Somehow when I'm here I can't help but become an absolute glutton. Although I have never attempted to eat "The Beast", I have witnessed it and it's a spectacle. Come here. You won't regret it
5
The Beast serves up excellent Southern American Cuisine, especially the Chicken and Waffles. Juicy and crispy fried chicken, with waffles that were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, served with a bourbon maple sauce that I could drink. Will definitely be back for more!
4
Extremely tasty blackened pork collar, though the asian in me would have enjoyed it a lot more with a bowl of rice (it was a tad too salty for me on its own, but that's just me and my "less salt" tongue, my partner enjoyed it very much as it was). Fried chicken on buttermilk waffle was great too, especially the crispy fried chicken
4
Had the heatseeker for sunday brunch. Chicken was spicy and the matchstick fries are really unique!!
4
The food here is good and there's live music on Friday. Good selection of bourbon and drinks too. Minimal indoor sitting but the outdoor sitting is not too bad too given the many fans around!
5
This was my 3rd visit to the restaurant. Chicken & waffle was great as usual. However, the DIY Sunday Brunch option is no longer available. PLEASE bring it back!!!!
4
Chicken and waffles never tasted so good. Still going strong and with a new Sunday brunch menu well priced at $14-$16, the beast is recommendedif you have a hankering for chicken and waffles as well as one of their biscuit buns.
5
The food is great as usual. My friend enjoyed the meal too! We ordered Buffalo Wings, Truffle Fries, Rib Eye Steak and Chicken with Waffles.
4
I have been here on weekend. As always i went to Singapore and stay at Bugis area, i try this place. This place have indoor and outdoor. If u smoking u can sit outdoor. U can enjoy ur food and drink and watchinh the street. The place have happy hours also. Steak was nice..u must try. This place easy to find. Opposite jalan kubor..in the corner of jalan kelapa. Happy holiday and cheer
4
We were sitting outdoors in the evening and the atmosphere was good, mainly because there was also sufficient fans to provide the cool wind of the night. Food and beer were good. And service was prompt even though we were sitting outdoors.For food we have 4 mains, a side and a beer each for four of us. Snapper portion could have been a bit bigger for the price thought
4
My friend and I ordered the Chicken and Waffles ($20++) and 3P burger ($24++) to share. We fell in love with photos of the chicken and waffles so that was what we came for. I'd say it's pretty good - the breading on the chicken is crunchy, the chicken meat super moist, and the waffle had a solid, crisp outer edge. The bourbon maple syrup that came with it added a bit of depth and variety to the savouriness. I imagine it might've been a bit too greasy if i had it on my own, so maybe a side of salad or something would make it more palatable. The 3P burger is the one I'll come back for. 3P includes pulled pork, bacon, and sliced pork, I believe, and each style of meat was tasty and the three were phenomenal together. I liked the pulled pork in particular because of how moist and flavourful it was, without drenching the burger bun. Plus, as a potato lover I really appreciated the mountain of skinny paprika-flavoured fries that came with the burger. Servings are large here so you get your money's worth. Tip: make reservations before coming, and add a special request to be seated indoors if you want to eat in an air-conditioned environment. Otherwise, sitting outdoors wasn't too bad in the evening and the restaurant's al fresco areas are more spacious too.
5
We had 2 starters; the shrimp and grits & corn n crab fritters. We shared the main which was Chicken and Waffles which was a substantial portion. I couldn't finish my half bec the starters were a good size. But all in all a good experience. Service was slightly slow and we had to work on our hand signals to catch the servers attention.
4
Long overdue review.Came here with two loved ones. Enjoyed the food, our orders include their signature Chicken and waffles, it lived up to its reputation, huge portions of crispy succulent fried chicken atop a crunchy yummy waffle.Too bad that their opening hours are so short.
5
The overall food is goods. Except the fish dish. The fish not fresh. The price is reasonable. Good for friends and couple
4
Overall is a good experience. The food are nice except for the swordfish, the smell very heavy. The taste of white wine is not good as well.
5
Had a great Blues band with tables on the sidewalk and a lively fun crowd. Small menu but a great time.
5
Food was served very promptly and the presentation was great. Music selection also matched the general setting of the restaurant. Staff was also very attentive to our needs.
3
The food was quite good. We had the famous fried chicken waffle and some sides coupled with beer and liquor. It was awesome!
5
Great food and friendly staff, atmosphere was great as well and was a great place for a romantic date.
3
The beast had nice ambience and live music on Friday nights. The food was average, not really worth the price though. The texture of the food wasnt too good but the seasoning was on point. The live music would have been nice if it wasnt so loud that it drowned our voices.
1
The food is very good, tasty and presentation is good but the let down is your service.There's no service at all. They basically take order then put your order on the table and that's it.- I came to find my own table- No attentiveness on service as they mostly are inside grouping together - Ordered drinks and was informed, most of the drink i ordered is not available- I request for a simple drink and the bar tender shook his head when the server was asking if it can be done and the bar tender was doing... nothing!- no apologies for a mistake doneThis place is a great hang out place and well done on the food taste! The live band is also great! The service needs more than just a training. Constant monitoring of the staff's workmanship is highly needed. It's not a matter of having management on the floor, the place can be run by junior staff if only they are trained enough. No upselling of what your restaurant offer. Overall, terrible service
5
Our dinning experience at The Beast was great. The staff were accommodating when we requested to take a table outdoors cause the indoor area felt stuffy for us. Food and beer were great and we were allowed to hold some orders of happy hours' beers to be served after the happy hours' window. And we felt the price was reasonable too. It was a Friday evening, all tables were occupied and yet the staff did a good job in serving us. Keep up the good work guys
1
Staff was rude and sat in the corner. Food maybe good? but waited 25 minutes for and appetizer never got it so left!Bartender didn't know how to make a Manhattan.... it's a bourbon bar! Really
4
The char-grilled rib-eye steak is great and those want to try some thing American can try the chicken & waffles which is fantastic too!
4
Very interesting and good food. Draft Beer is fresh and light. Chicken and Waffles are very crispy and good.
4
It's my 3rd visit here, and the food has been consistent and good. Tried the 3P burger & steak. Especially loved the truffle mashed potato that came with the steak!
4
Nice Ambiance! We booked a table at the second floor, It is an ideal place to hold gatherings.
Not too crowded and noisy. If you are a fan of southern food, please don't miss out this place!
5
was at The Beast on a friday night and the young female server was extremely friendly .
we ordered the pork collar twice becase it was superb, also ordered 3P pulled pork burger and chicken waffles. the pork collar dish stood out the most.
5
Portion was large and food quality was good. Staff were very friendly, when we told them it's a birthday celebration, they prepared a waffle with ice cream. Thanks!
3
tried the 3P burger and the pork collar. Pork collar was quite tender, but i found the 3P burger to be more interesting - a combination of flavourful pulled pork, candies bacon and grilled pork belly. the bun itself was average but the fillings, including the slaw was good
4
Nice little joint serving Southern American comfort food. The place has a strong Caucasian customer base. The menu isn't extensive but you don't need variety when fried chicken waffles/fried chicken with biscuits is all you need! The fried chicken was crispy and tender and the biscuit was pretty decent. It is also very affordable with the entertainer app. The place gets a bit stuffy and hot though.
5
its a great and cool place with unique, relaxing atmosphere to have a nice meal and or drinks. The staff are friendly and casual. The supervisor knew his bourbons and drinks and advised well with good suggestions.They got a massive collection of bourbons and craft beers as well as other drinks and cocktails at decent prices.Additionally to all stated by others I would like to add that the place is very special. Its a lovely pre-war classic shophouse in a conservation shophouses enclave. it got a couple of levels and a nice choice of venues.You can chose to sit outside or inside in air-conditioned area or by the authentic bar. There are also 2nd floor sittings as well.This restaurant has a very long frontage along Victoria Street, one of the major streets in Singapore. So its one of relatively rare such alfresco restaurants and bars where one can enjoy food and drinks outside. The surroundings are nice, not the usual crowded concrete as in many other alfresco places in Singapore. There is ample space for both smokers and non smokers to enjoy outdoors. Especially if you are having a cigar. There are very few such places here that you can have a nice food and drinks and have a smoke.And we do it quite often here in The Beast.Its one of these places that if you come with friends, you will have a good time. If you come on business, you will have a nice and easygoing conversation.And if you come with family, everybody will be at ease with the place and food. If you are a local or visitor, its well worth a visit for the locale and atmosphere
4
Okay, take the time and read some of the signs inside, and remember ya'all is both singular and plural. Stopped in for dinner and we ordered the southern fried chicken with beans and corn bread, along with a tall draft. The jerk rub chicken and as okay but the southern fried was great.Followed it up with their ice cream sundae that is served in a martini glass, loved it. They took away the barrel tables outside and replaced them with bench tables, guess they needed more seating, but can still grab a barrel table inside.Some have commented on the service but on Wednesday evening at 8:00pm our service was excellent. Walked past on Friday night and it was overflowing onto the entire sidewalk, so if you go during the week I would expect good service, plus you won't be crowded. Give it a try and enjoy.
3
The food was great! Crabcake, fried spring chicken and especially the pork belly. Transported me to Louisiana in an instant.
Can say the same for the service. Need some brushing up.
3
Dinner was mediocre. Cocktail was a joke. We ordered two pitchers and they were both diluted! The best thing I had there was the Beast Dessert Platter.
5
Cool place with great happy hour and bar snacks. Outdoor tables and street energy is good. Staff are on the ball and the drinks are cheap and free flowing. Worth a visit if in Bugis area
4
The service crews there are very friendly and nice. Kudos to the female crew who worked alone at lvl2 on a Friday night and maintained a good customer service and product knowledge. Good job!
5
If you are an Amercian looking for some good ole American Soul Food with a Gourmet Twist, look no further, the Veast will feed your need!
5
Love love love the food! Typical American food! Huge portions too. Totally worth the price! Highly recommended!
5
The Beast is one of my go-to favorites when I am looking for a hearty and delicious American style meal. They are known for their burger challenge, but the swordfish collar and chicken/waffles are also excellent staples. They have an impressive collection of American craft brews available, as well as American liquors such as Fireball and SoCo. The waiter though was quite rude about splitting our bill, he claimed it wasn't possible to put a defined amount on one card and a defined amount on the other (as opposed to splitting 50/50). We had to convince him that it was possible and the manager showed him how to do it. He might have been new, but we definitely shouldn't have had to tell him how to do his job.
1
1 star because I can't give one star. The restaurant has a decent Boyrbon collection but who doesn't?!!The food is very average and the service is probably THE worst...And their menus are VERY deceiving. Our group of 10+ pax raked up almost a $1500 bill...Unlike any normal menu the number right next to rhe glass price is NOT the bottle price but "proof" - so if you don't check properly you assume it to be bottle price. Further the staff definitely not responsive and very unhelpful, even after we paid such a sizeable bill. Never again
3
Ok the burger was good. Not a big selection, but the necessary mix was available.Quite a good snack list, lite bites. But the price is not the cheapest even though this is a sit down restaurant in a way.Service was not very attentive, but then, very little was required by the staff. Not for the average kid to eat here
4
We has the fried chicken and waffles, pork belly, mac and cheese and the pecan pie for dessert. All tasted fantastic together with happy hour German draft beer. The only disappointment was that we had to sit outside because I booked online and failed to specify indoor seating. I can't remember if the site had an option to specify this. Luckily it didn't rain!
4
The Beast was a great little southern inspired pub. Chicken waffles with Cajun Chips, Char grilled rib eye and a traditional style burger are some of the fare that is on offer. Great southern style food with heaps of American Craft beers on offer.
4
We celebrated my brother's 21st bday! The staff was nice enough to throw in a yummy complientary pumpkin pie with a candle. The food was bourbon inspired , so was the cafe! The Fried chicken on waffles was the best.
4
We came to have brunch on a Sunday. As a fan of southern style food, we ordered the fried chicken, biscuit and pulled pork. Honestly, they are all pretty tasty. Would definitely go back for dinner and drinks on a weeknight.
3
The service was good but felt that the food was too blend. We had the fried chicken on waffle and the 3p burger
5
Enjoyed our dinner at The Beast - we ordered Pork Collar and Chicken and Waffle. Both were great!
The music was also awesome, we had a great catch up.
3
Brunch food is rather good, southern BBQ with lots of options to customise your order. However service is slow. This is ok as long as you're not starving or in a rush. Loved the chicken and waffles!
4
Located just by the main road at Jalan Klapa, it's easily spotted by people commuting by bus or just walking around. Stop by for a well deserved drink at $8 nett for housepour drinks / wine / half pint of Weihenstephan beer for happy hour! Great friendly service from the staff (great compliments to Sherman!) and the food was served to us hot and appetizing. My bf, my best friend and I enjoyed a great night of food and drinks last Friday night and the bill came up to $240 but we all went home happy, tipsy and satisfied with the dining experience. Will definitely recommend our friends to come and enjoy.
3
Came here for the giant burger challenge thingy for my birthday. It was a great novelty but other than that, wasn't all that great to eat. We also ordered a couple dishes like the fried chicken and some desserts. Nothing to complain about but nothing to be amazed at either. I'd better recommend this place for drinks and bites rather than a full proper meal
3
Was here for Sunday brunch recently and had their Dutch baby pancake. It was good but maybe not worth the $16, and it was definitely not exceptional. The food was definitely on the expensive side (~$60 for 2 mains + 2 drinks), but for the novelty I thought it was good enough and was worth a try. The sweet tea was lovely and refreshing for a hot day, but at $7 I probably won't have it again after having already tried it. As mentioned in the title, service as poor-average. Waitstaff were lukewarm, inattentive and seemed oblivious to guests arriving and dining. I thought maybe it was because this is a gastropub and they're more used to working behind the bar, but there was a 10% service charge. The atmosphere of the place definitely leans more towards a drinking/live music venue. There was very little sitting space to really be able to enjoy a meal, and the barrel tables - while cool-looking - was really cramped as the barrels took up all the leg space. Imagine having something where your legs would normally go under a table, so you'd either have to sit with your legs spread apart around the barrel or sit sideways and twist your back while eating. The outdoor seats looked comfortable though, but on a hot and sunny morning they didn't seem like a viable option. TL;DR: food was decent and the price can perhaps be justified by the novelty; worth trying once but won't return for the food

A friend had recommended the Beast to me and I had high expectations. It did not meet them. The food was mostly disappointing. The southern fried chicken looked very pretty but the flavor was chalky. Unremarkable otherwise. My wife had the pork collar. I thought parts of it were excellent (the fatty bits). But the meatier parts were dry. Also, the identity of this dish needs some clarification. It was served like it aspired to be haute couture: pork collar on a bed of sautÃ©ed green beans and mashed potatoes with a splash of gravy? I did enjoy the poutines a lot though. Get it if you go. Calorie bomb. Oh Canada. For the prices paid for these dishes (not to mention the high ratings on trip advisor), I really expected better quality food!The service was middling. My wife's meal came 10-15 minutes before mine. And it was lukewarm. We were there on the early side of dinner. So this was extremely confusing. For several reasons. Also. No beer on tap (they have one beer on tap - did they forget to order a new keg for weeks?). Really? At a southern place?I did like the outside seating. It's pleasant. Good view of a local mosque. And the people walking by. Finally, there was live guitar. The guy played David Gray. I haven't heard David Gray since 2001. Loved it.

Great burgers. Grilled fish and crabcakes not so good - both had a strong fishy smell. Expensive food for casual pub dining. Staff had an indifferent attitude- no smiles, not warm and friendly.
5
Thanks for the very smooth reservation process and fast confirmation. Will definitely use Chope on my next reservations! Till next time.
4
A nice causal n cosy place for after work drink catch up. Price are relatively reasonable. Food and drink are good. Recommends: Must try the waffle chicken.
4
Fries were delightfully crispy and the sauce in the burger was great. However beef patty was slightly tough.
4
The service was excellent and it meets the diners experience pretty much. Keep it up! Will go back for the next time round!
5
Great food and service provided by the team at The Beast. The pork collar and swordfish were really good, and the fried chicken on waffles was nice as well. Happy hour $8 drinks. Overall a great place!
4
We ate there for a friends birthday, reserved a table outside which was pretty nice and cooling since it was at night. We ordered an assortment of food, their fish dishes were not the best, in fact avoid them. Chicken and waffles was amazing, burgers were pretty good too. We had a dessert platter which was really nice and a great way to end the meal. We had their draught beers, which were refreshing but I noticed they sell an extensive range of bourbons so if you are a fan of bourbon I would recommend giving it a try (: Will come back again for the chicken and waffles(:
4
Loved the chicken waffle, 3P burger, southern chicken, pimento cheese fritter. We were seated on the second floor which is nice if you're catching up in a group and would prefer to be away from the live performance on the ground floor. But service can be slow cos the kitchen and bar are on the ground floor and they use a dumb waiter to bring the food and drinks up. So our 3 pints of beer were served one by one over the span of 30mins. Which was quite the first for me. Food was served at a reasonable pace. There awre only 1 or 2 staff waiting on the second floor so it got a little difficult to be attended to during peak dinner time but they are friendly and polite so it's not a big deal to me
3
Received a call a few hours prior to tell me that my party and I will be getting a table outdoor....at this heat no way. Hence a bit of annoyance trying to explain to the lady on the phone. But then she said she will make arrangements to have the tables join together. Why can't this be offered immediately when I mentioned that I don't want to be outdoor? Service in the restaurant definitely need improvement. Reached the restaurant, had to say "excuse me" to the gentleman 3 times before he acknowledged my presence. He was busy fiddling something on his device. The service staff on the second floor was a mix feeling. They are not friendly at first but lighten up after. Serving the food and drinks were awful, just dumping it and walk awayFood wise, very nice. Like an American diner, big portions. Their southern fried chicken was too salty for my taste but I still like it. Soft shell crab, the cheese sticks were to die for. Will I come back again? Perhaps. 
3
We ordered the burger ($22) and the swordfish ($22) and an IPA craft beer ($18). The burger patty was good but overall, for a joint that sells the Beast burgers, the portion was disappointingly small. The swordfish was really bony. Staff were friendly when approached, but lacked energy. Could do a lot better on all fronts.
5
1st trip to the beast and it didn't disappoint. Food was great. Though the draft beer wasn't great. Overall experience was good.
4
Truly southern. Great chicken & waffles, blackened pork collar and southern poutine. Will be back again.
4
Great food,service was excellent. Servers are friendly and always be there to assist. definitely a great place to hang around after a hectic working day
3
Overall dining experiences was great, some of the dishes (Monster soft shell crabs, Fried Mozzarella cheesesticks) were well executed. Near missed Chicken & Waffles - too overrated.
4
First time dining at The Beast recently... and had the BEST fried chicken I have ever tasted. Nicely marinated and fried and the chicken was juicily yummy. The corncake was out of this world. A must try. Burgers were great too. While the food was fantastic, I think the owners need to install new and more powerful ACs man. Will certainly return for the food but the AC situation kinda 'discourage' me a bit
4
We asked for a bit of everything.. Went there during lunch but they told us that they didn't have many things in the menu especially the appetizers, also they had ran out of diced potatoes only had mashed potatoes. Ray, our server, young girl and it looked like she didn't want to be there and made some of the experience really bad. The owner or whoever runs this place needs to ensure that customer service gets better!! The food was good and I would not go back is customer service does not improve. Like I said, we asked for a bit of everything, the chicken and waffles..I had better, but the pulled pork, the Mac and cheese burger and the steak and eggs were really good! The cornbread was delicious!
4
Love the chicken & waffles, blackened pork collar, southern poutine! I will order either of these again!Their food are a bit salty, but still taste great! Fried chicken not too oily. And there's 1 for 1 mains for entertainer app. Menu & prices can be found in their website
2
When you order drinks and food. And the food arrives before the drinks you know there is a problem. Oh the drink was a bottle of beer too. I guess they lost their bottle opener. What a "wonderful" bar. Food was as Southern as can be made by a microwave, go here if cold and salty burgers is your thing. Only thing worthwhile was the Litre of Beer.
5
Picked this Kitchen + Bar place for a birthday celebration for my friend after being impressed by a recent visit. Six of us were given a table on the second level, which is by far more comfortable and enjoyable and provided a good escape from the humidity in Singapore. We ordered among us: Blackened Pork Collar, Chicken and Waffles, 3P Burger and Southern Fried Chicken as well as a few mugs of lagers. The lagers were definitely value for money as the Beast Mug comes in a litre but costs only 24 SGD. Our lovely waitress, Megan, was highly attentive and very helpful in providing us with good recommendations for food and drinks. The evening truly did not disappoint. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and would strongly recommend the place for special events
3
Apart from the slightly disappointing cocktail, which was a little bland (despite the overwhelming rhubarb flavouring), the food was hearty. Perhaps a little greasy but pretty much Southern and satisfying. The ambiance could be improved, ok, it's a pub on the ground floor, but seriously, lighting and all could do with some improvement.
4
Food was served quickly and food (Chicken & Waffles) was great! Dining was at the 2nd floor with good air conditioning
4
We had a lovely and romantic experience at the Beast. The food was very good and the atmosphere somewhat quaint and romantic :) The service was also very good.
5
Good and attentive service. We had the chicken and waffles, soft shell crab, pecan pie with honey ice cream (delish), a pitcher of tea and 2 cocktails. Cocktail sizes are pretty small but it was good. Spent about $200 in all.
5
The Beast offers a fun environment along with delicious southern food and though it's a bit pricey the food really is incredibly tasty and the portions are large. The bottomless mimosas at $30 are the best deal in town, even though I suspect they became more orange juice and less champagne as the number increased.
3
Wasn't really that impressed with the breakfast offerings here. I opted for the big southern breakfast which was bordering on disappointing (potatoes not so hot, too much mayonnaise, and a biscuit instead of toast). There are better places to go in the area
4
So i went on a hut for chicken & waffles and was introduced to The Beast by my sis. We had 3 mains and a side. 1. The big biscuit - looks like a huge mountain of food. Eggs, biscuit, chicken with side salad. Tasty and filling2. Chicken & waffles - this is the normal waffles. Fluffy, but a little bland, otherwise quite tasty. Chicken thigh was fried nicely, crispy with a flavorful batter. Meat was tender and juicy as well. 3. Brunch combo - pulled pork and bacon, cornbread waffles, scramble eggs with Caesar salad - cornbread waffles was heavier than the normal waffles and it fills you up pretty quick. Pulled pork was tender and melts in the mouth, very good taste. Scrambled eggs was a tad soft and mushy. Tasted better ones outside4. Aunt ordered a cornbread - it was warm, soft and sweet to the mouth. Yumm! Total bill came up to $80++ with a flat white. Mid range, not cheap but not overly costly as well. Pretty good value for the food we had
5
Had dinner at The Beast on a Saturday night with our folks. Fantastic food. No regrets in taking up Megan, our server's, recommendations. We especially loved the succulent pork collar, 3P burger and the beautifully crusted fresh snapper on a bed of dirty rice. Special thanks, especially from our parents, to Megan for the warm and friendly service.
5
The food was delicious. There were 3 of us. We shared 3 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert. We enjoyed the corn bread and poutine. The 3P burger was one of our favourites together with the waffle chicken. Simple hearty food not to be missed. The server was attentive and friendly too. We will definitely come back again
3
The food was average and I find their servings were too small but their staff are friendly and cheerful, service was good and it's a pretty decent place to grab a beer and chill out but not recommended for large groups as the place is quite cramp and it's definitely not suitable for kids and pregnant ladies
4
Went there on a Thursday and turns out it was an open mic night! We had fun listening to some of them.Its a small place indoors, and the food is decent (like the chicken more than the waffles, awesome iced tea though). Service can be better though - for a small place we had a hard time getting anyone's attention.
5
Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and as requested, the friendly staff wrote happy birthday on the pie we ordered (which was delicious) and even lighted a candle for us! The food was great, especially the rib eye steak. Overall great experience.
5
Good location. Great place for friends gathering. Excellent food,especially the chicken & waffles =)
4
Our first visit. The quality of food is good. We had the pork collar, 3P burger & chicken waffle. All dishes we selected were well executed.Service can be better as we need to get the attention of the server even thou only 2 tables were occupied in the whole restaurant when we were there
1
The food was a disappointment. Waffles were not freshly made! Either too soggy or dried up.The waitress was grumbling that she is all alone to do her job. bad impression.We waited quite long to pay and it wasn't even packed with clients. Guess I have spend too much for such lousy southern fare
5
this was my second visit to the bar in just 2 weeks. the food (mains and sides) were good and the staff were very friendly and attentive. overall may be a little bit pricey but the ambience and food definitely made up for it. great place to hang out with your friends for a beer after a long weekend.
4
This is just around the corner from our accommodation. As with all places in Singapore the drinks are very expensive $14 for a glass of wine. The young Singapore people love it. Great customer service. Snapper, Sword Fish are well priced compared to Australia. Shrimp n grits were great
5
We booked an 11am slot and had the whole upper level to ourselves! We found the music that was playing too loud and requested for the volume to be lowered which they kindly did so immediately. That made it more pleasant for us to have conversations. Food was great too and served quite fast
4
I was pretty excited about trying the menu here as they feature American food from the South. And I am looking forward to return on a night when I can try one of their bourbon flights. I most definitely wanted to try dessert so I only had an appetizer: Maryland Crabcake which is 2 small cakes which don't have any breadcrumbs or crunchy exterior but they were delicious. I had an Arnold Palmer to drink and when I finished that I had a Southern Sweet Tea. They were both good. The Arnold Palmer tasted like the lemonade component was homemade, not some powder mix. The Southern Sweet Tea was most definitely SWEET and had a bit of lemon flavor to it. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed it. It's small because it's an appetizer. We would like to see it as an entrÃ©e. For dessert, he had the peach crumble and I had the flaming skillet blondie. The peach crumble was OK, but the skillet blondie was definitely the star of the show. Service was nice. The only aspect I didn't like was we sat indoors and it's all high top or bar seating there. I really prefer sitting in chairs where my feet touch the ground or else my legs/feet tend to fall asleep. There were some lower tables outdoors I think, but outside you are right next to a busy street. I prefer to dine without bus exhaust as a condiment
4
Expected a restaurant style concept but turns out to be a bar concept which is fine. Thurs nights is apparently open mic night so being indoors may not be ideal if the idea is to catch up over dinner/drinks. Not many seats indoors so if it rains, you might be seated outdoors where you might get wet despite the shelter. Food is great especially their happy hour promo bites of S1++ before 7pm
4
Chicken and waffles - love the syrup!CornbreadSweet teaWhen I placed my order I asked to start with the cornbread followed by the chicken and waffles, but the chicken and waffles came first with the cornbread shortly after. I had to eat both at once which was stressful. First world problems..
4
Nice food, beautiful environment, staff is kind and service-oriented! Had a small incident but it did not affect my dining at all
5
great food, great service. servers tirelessly kept refilling our water even though we drank like camels, and cleared our food promptly when we were done, without being invasive. Would definitely go back again!
5
I went in with low expectations of finding good southern USA style food in Singapore. I was very pleasantly surprised. Blackened Pork Collar and Southern Fried chicken were our favorites and the Bourbon Pecan Pie was to die for!
4
We love the ambiance and the food at this resto! The poutine's our all-time favorite! The service is amazing too! And oh, they serve free popcorn, what's there not to like?!
1
Never could understand this place. Each time I come in, the constant experience is of being totally and absolutely ignored by the wait staff. Look at you as though you are not there. The only time you get their initial attention is when they tell you that you are occupying a reserved table.It may have decent menu and you may eventually get half decent service if you can live past the initial cold shoulder, but I think the service element of the wait staff here seriously needs a kick-in-the-butt. Wait staff service standards are generally not fantastic in Singapore, but this place is one of the worst I have ever experienced
4
Their chicken and waffles is worth a try, but I do recommend that this be shared as too much is way too much if you know what I mean...chicken is on the salty side too but still tasty, and waffles is fluffy enough...I loved the southern poutineFlaming skillet blonde would be good but since I didn't like alcohol, one bite is all I had...my friends gobbled it up...They do have a beasty burger which needs to be pre-ordered and that cost $125 - no we didn't go for that...just the 3P burger which was recommended by the staff. I didn't eat that cos the chicken and waffles is more than enoughOne thing that I do not like - high chairs...not very comfortable to eat from...can't decide if this is more a restaurant or a pub...extensive drinks menu though..
4
They got a very nice selection of craft beers, and the burgers they have are succulent. However, you have to get some 3 - 4 hungry friends and go for the huge burger, called "The Beast". It costs around 120 SGD, but you get your money`s worth. This thing is humongous. And you'd never expect it would taste as good as it does. They have a few different kinds of meat inside, all of them juicy and tasteful.There's a challenge where if you eat all by yourself, in 1:30 hours, the burger is free. (last checked in October '15)
4
Drinks were decently priced - G&T's for starters, followed by some interesting American Craft beer and finally a selection of Bourbon to wash down our dinner. Food was delightfully sinful - Bacon Mac&Cheese, Pulled Pork Sliders & Fried Steak. All very yummy - great menu selection, wanted to try everything! Thursday nights are open mic, the live music was a good entertainment. Staff were decent. Overall great food, music and environment - perfect recipe for a fun night ;
4
Ordered truffle fries, hot buffalo wings, pulled pork sliders and fish tacos to share among three pax. loved the blue cheese dip that came together with the buffalo wings. fish taco came with only 3 taco shells which is insufficient for the amount of fish pieces. will definitely return!
4
Late dinner and drinks at the Beast was a pleasurable experience. The range of spirits (and spirit cocktails) on offer is extensive, staff knowledgeable and atmosphere good. Food was also very good. I recommend trying both some spirits and house cocktails plus some food on the side
4
The dinner session and the environment was decent and relaxing for the patrons. The foods quantity was not sufficient for my dinner and I guess I will consider increase the amount of food available.
4
Booked this place for a small birthday gathering, knowing we wanted something low key and relaxed, and many of the other burgers / steaks places in SG are frustratingly first in, best dressed (no reservations).We had a great night. The food is honest and good and the cocktails really first rate. Their homegrown southern comfort (with lime as a shot or with lime and sprite if you're taking it slower) is a must do.Live music, a road-side seat (with hefty fans to keep us cool) and good service all rounded up to make it a new favourite spot for a chilled night out
4
I reserved a table for 2 to enjoy dinner with my partner. We were pleasantly surprised at the cosy ambience yet near to the bar. Food was delicious. We ordered the pulled pork sliders, buffalo wings and chicken on a waffle. Meat was well marinated and tasty. Waffle was crispy and matched the food with it. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselve
4
Didn't want to try the beast burger challenge cos it's a little pricey and there's only me and my gf. Ordered farm boy's Burger and buttermilk waffle chicken. The burger's portion was decent. Managed to fill me up just nice. The patty tastes fresh. Burger tastes sweet. Fries was normal normal. The buttermilk waffle chicken was more interesting. It's a mix of sweet (waffle) and spicy/savory (chicken) which makes it interesting to bite into both together. The chicken tastes a little like macdonald's mcspicy. But the batter on the chicken tastes good!They offer free popcorn (just plain)! The waiters/waitresses were very friendly and helpful, always on the lookout for the needs of the customers. Music played was conducive for conversations, not too loud or jarring. In summary, it's a good place to just hangout and chill with decent portions of food to fill the tummy
4
The Beast is your nice lil neighbourhood bar, where if you go often enough, everyone will know your name. :-) I've been wanting to try the American classic fried chicken and waffles for a while now and I must admit, I was not disappointed! Yes, it IS a weird combination especially when you douse it with the maple syrup, but.. it somehow works!The food is delicious and has generous portions and the service very good
4
This place was initially a back-up plan, as I wasn't able to secure reservation around the bay area and a company partner was coming into town - I needed a space for about 15 people. I didn't have much expectation, but it turned out to be a very pleasant experience!Making a reservation was simple, I was pleased with the cozy corner set up for us on the second level. It was perfect as it was conducive for conversations, since the band was downstairs and there were only a couple other patrons on the second level. Service staff was attentive and helpful. Not only did he fill us in on the unwritten drinks promotion, but he also helped us to adjust the air-conditioner that was initially blowing directly onto our faces. I requested for a birthday surprise to be served at 10 PM and it was nicely done - complimentary ice cream waffle. I was very touched when he asked us whether we would need anything else that evening, as he was going for a short break. The promise of Southern goodness in the food didn't disappoint either. The fries were savoury, well-seasoned (both the truffle fries and the side dish served with the steak). My company seemed pretty happy with their food. There's a wide selection of drinks. I found the southern sweet tea with bourbon really refreshing. If there's an area of improvement, it would probably be to be more generous with the bourbon - be it in the sauce for the fried chicken, or in the drinks. All in all, we're very pleased and would like to come back again
5
Decided to spend a friend's birthday here and we were all impressed. The food did not disappoint and the staff were extremely friendly. They even threw in free ice cream and waffles for us knowing it was our friend's birthday. The only qualm about the place might be that the tables are too small for large groups, as it was a little packed for us once the food came. Nonetheless, small issue and would definitely go back!
2
This place has the most snotty and unprofessional staff! Customer service is definitely NOT at the heart of their business. Major fail
3
Friday night dinner at The Beast was nice, they had a live two man band playing good acoustic music but it was weird that the performance was situated inside at the back end of the bar. Although the music was also played on the outside speakers, I thought it would be nice if the performance area was more "outside" rather than stuck at the back of the bar on the "inside" of the Beast. Food was served promptly, the menu has a nice selection from bar bites to southern inspired mains to something sweet to finish the meal. Overall good place for a chillout night!
4
Honestly was not expecting much for the quality of the food but was surprised it was really good. Items on the menu is not a lot but the quality and how big the serving of the food is really worth it. Will definitely go back on this place
4
I loved the way it was seasoned, light batter but crispy and flavorful. I have to say I never had better.... Great bistro atmosphere and the thursday open mic sessions added a huge fun element to it!
5
Good pub food, not your usual American fare
Great service. Were about to try another place, but it had so many bad service reviews, was good to go to a place that had good service
Fun place especially on Open Mic night
2
Came for brunch - the food was just barely okay. The bloody marys were downright disgusting. This place lacks class and taste. Do not come here to eat, there are so many way better options right up the street. I have noticed that they have live music in the evening – this place has a bar vibe and could work for an evening with drinks and music – just eat elsewhere beforehand
3
We ate on the second level and there were only 2 servers for the whole level.There were at least 3 groups of large tables and a few couples. 2 staff was definitely not enough to cater to everyone. One staff member was missing half the time as she had to run up and down to cater to the drink orders which left 1 person to take orders, serve food and man the cashier
4
Lovely evening out with friends. Great selection of bourbons and very good southern style food + live band downstairs. The fried chicken was awesome. The blackened pork collar was very good. The prawns and grits looked excellent. The steak was pretty ordinary though. If you book, you need to specifically ask for upstairs or you might end up with a table in the bar, which is fine if you want to watch the band. Special call out to Dez the manager for sorting out our table and getting us upstairs
5
First discovered this eatery a little more than a month ago, but I've returned 4 more times since. And every time I bring friends there, they will return with another set of friends. It's just that good. The ambience is relaxing, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. It's all about Southern fare here - think fried chicken, grit, catfish, cornbread. And boy must I rave about the cornbread! Such a humble little dish, but I can make a whole meal out of them! So soft, so fluffy, so melt-in-your-mouth, so perfect with that bit of butter drizzled with syrup!So bring your friends, bring an empty stomach, and plan on kicking your heels back for at least a couple hours, southern style!
1
Really terrible service. We waited 20 mins for drinks and then was told that the kitchen and bar was slammed. This was 7:30 on a Saturday night. I see patrons in April had the same issue. I can't speak to the food as we gave up and found a place that was properly staffed for a Saturday night
4
This place serve Southern American cooking. Cocktail and Draft beer are available too. They have both indoor and outdoor seating at the lower floor. As the night goes later, the place will become a bit squeeze. For me, I ate fried chicken with waffles and it taste superb. Food is simple but everyone has their own preference whether it is nice or not? So, why not take a chance to try out this place? Remember, the mimosas are free flow ... keep asking while you're drinking there ..
4
Our table was for 2 people, we ordered the fried chicken and the Steak.Chicken was juicy and steak was charred just right.We had the pecan pie, but it was a tad too sweet for us.I enjoyed the meal, and will come back again
5
I went here with my friends on a Monday night and we ordered breaded beef steak, truffle fries, corn bread, chicken & waffle, prawn and grid, Mississippi mud pie, pecan pie and peach crumble. For drinks we had the draft beer, Woodchuck hard cider, Magic Hat No. 9 and Dream Machine Ale. The food was awesome and definitely worth the price. They had huge servings which were very very tasty. The service is also fast and good. We are planning to make this place our new hang out.
4
Today we hit The Beast which was located a couple of streets from Arab St. The diner itself wasn't a spacious establishment, but it does make for a cosy gathering with friends!Their signature dish would probably be the Chicken and Waffle. A hearty serving of southern chicken from a selection of thigh or breast meat served on a fluffy waffle. Not forgetting a tiny pint of maple syrup to complete the experience... A good avenue to spend my calories on!
1
I went as a group of 4 on Saturday night. I was seated on the 2nd floor, along with 2 other groups. After taking our orders and serving them, the waitress disappeared for the rest of the night. We had to leave our seat to look for the waitress to get more water and place additional orders. We also used the Entertainer app - this was communicated to the restaurant when making our reservation. Unfortunately, we only discovered at the end of the meal that the restaurant had the unique policy of charging a 10% service charge for the full price of the meal, notwithstanding that we had used the Entertainer app. This is not the policy of any of the other restaurants listed on the Entertainer app that we have visited (and we have visited many). Neither is this listed on any of the Entertainer app's terms and conditions. When questioned, the manager's only response was "this is our company policy". No other reason or explanation given. After I gave my credit card to pay, we waited for 15 to 20 additional minutes for the bill to be processed. The credit card did not return (and remember, the waitress was nowhere to be found). Finally, losing patience, we walked downstairs. I only managed to get my credit card back after walking all the way up to the first floor waitress and asking for it. Separately, the food was average. The second floor eating area can get quite noisy when there are big groups in attendance, as it echoes a lot in the room.
1
My friends and I (6 of us in total) went over to The Beast for dinner just last night. When we reached, we thought that the place was quaint, the staff seemed friendly too. So we ordered food, which I have to say was pretty impressive even though it was mostly fried stuff. We also ordered a bottle of "Redemption High Rye". We looked at the number beside the item and it claimed to be "92". So yes, naturally we would assume that is the price of the bottle cos this seems to be the practice for all the bars that we've been to...... to print the PRICE beside the item. So we finished the first bottle quite quickly. And then we decided to open a second bottle just to merry the long weekend away. When we called for the bill at the end of the night, each bottle turns out to be 200 bucks. SERIOUSLY?! We asked to look at the menu again and pointed out that the "price" was indeed 92, and the waiters just told us nonchalantly "That is not the price, that is the PRF." He tried to explain what it meant but we were just too confused with the situation. Nothing on the menu even had "200" printed beside them. They also claimed that we should have "checked before we ordered". Well I certainly thought that that was false advertising. It tried to create the impression that the drinks were of a certain price when in fact it was marked up a lot higher. This is not a classy thing to do. This is called cheating
5
Jenny our attendant for the evening was EXCELLENT! Happy, helpful & always willing to assist us 8 over excited Aussies. Meal was "to die for" way to generous in portions but dellish! Cocktails were pricey but that's Singapore in general but they too were dellish. Would highly recommend this venue if in the area & will definitely go back
4
I really enjoyed my visit there and fulfilled my desire for chicken and waffles, which is pretty rare in Singapore. The chicken was tender but the waffle is a bit too airy but is really crispy and light. The maple syrup that came with the chicken and waffles was pretty decent, not too sweet but i will appreciate a little spice in that! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder which is so tender! Love it! And to end the dinner, we have a bourbon pecan pie! So good! I will definitely go back again for more southern fixes
4
Went early in the evening before the crowd, so we enjoyed faster service. All our meals were really good. Alcoholic drinks are very pricy in Singapore so you might want to watch the bill in that respect. With 2 or 3 per person, you can easily spend over $100 each here. The ambiance is nice, my only regret was not bringing a light sweater because they keep the air con on HIGH. Which can be a great thing as long as you aren't sitting right under the blast
3
I had the Chicken and Waffles because i had heard it was one of their signature dishes. It did not live up to expectations for a few reasons: firstly, the waffle was too soft and airy, allowing it to easily be flattened under the chicken. I was expecting cake batter waffles, like the Belgian variety or a texture similar to southern buttermilk biscuits (which they also have and do quite well). Secondly, there was no subtlety in the flavours - the fried chicken was quite one-dimensional and did not even surpass Popeye's chicken in taste, while the waffle was plain and the only other flavour provided was the bourbon maple butter sauce, which was quite good but not enough to save the dish as a whole.The final factor was the price: at $20+ (no GST), i did not get my money's worth with this experience
4
We brought a friend here for his stag night, and unleashed The Beast on him. I won't spoil the surprise - you can ask any of the friendly servers what the Beast Challenge is - but suffice to say it was incredibly impressive (even though he didn't complete the challenge). The challenge alone makes for a fun experience.As a restaurant, the food is not a bad take on Southern food, especially in our little tropical outpost known as Singapore, but it remains a faithful tribute rather than a real version of the food. Not bad at all, but "it needs more buttah". 
5
I recall having brunch at IHOP when I was in the states. Liked it very much then as a teen. Tried the brunch food at the beast thrice and each time the food is great. I felt like I was in the states again! The beast offers a great combination of variety and hearty American classics. Like the Dutch baby pancake which my 9 year-old loved. The free flow mimosa was splendid for a hot Sunday. Ambience wise, the 2nd floor is very comfortable but wasn't conducive for my 80yo grandparents. We sat outside on the chairs with the back rests and it was quite ok, as there were fans blowing full blast (also because the weather was nice and cool). Price wise, it's ok but the portions are big for Asians so it's definitely worth it! :

I first heard about The Beast from a friend's Facebook timeline, and it just so happened that I had a craving for some friend chicken. So off I went to find out more about The Beast from their Facebook page and their web site. The web site contained two useful bits of info - the address (postal code + Google Maps = #WIN!) and their menu, complete with prices.First impression - prices look reasonable, portions look 'American'Turns out that their web site takes reservations, so I placed one for my and parents for their Sunday brunch. Note that The Beast (as of the time of this review) doesn't open till 5 pm on weekdays, and runs from 10am to 5 pm on Sundays.The place turned out to be rather easy to find, and we got lucky with parking. Parking is usually a PITA around the area, so I was thanking my lucky stars for a good start.The Sunday brunches aren't a packed affair (for now), so we got seated quickly. Water is self-served from a nice ice cold water dispenser on the bar, and the menu is a simple and effective one-page/sheet affair.My dad had the pulled pork, while my mum and I had the fried chicken and biscuit. Neither disappointed - the pulled pork came in a sizzling pan and was aromatic, juicy and tender. The friend chicken was mind-glowingly good - perfectly fried and crispy on the outside, soft, tender and juicy on the inside. The biscuits were a bit heavy, but otherwise tasty without being too buttery.if the portions weren't so darn big, I'd have gone for the cheeseburger as well, but as it was, we wanted to save some space for dessert. So we had the Bourbon Pecan Pie, which did not disappoint at all. Beautifully creamy and rich caramel with soft, perfectly cooked figs, and lightly crunchy pecan nuts, seated atop an brilliantly firm crumble base which practically melted in my mouth.I will certainly return for more - the fried chicken on waffles beckons! From what I could see from the next table, the portion was even bigger and the waffle looked heavenly.That said, I'd make it a point to go for the Mimosa/ Bloody Mary the next time - $16 gets you an hour of free-flowing goodness. My dad and I opted for the Fresh Lemonade, which didn't disappoint (it was refreshing and perfectly done), though it was a tad expensive at $7 a glass

Had a really wonderful experience at this place, esp the biggest and juiciest burger in town. Will definitely visit again.

Good happy Hour deal. The food was pretty authentically Southern, and my wife was born and raised in the south. The shrimp and grits were good,though only comes with 4 shrimp and the fried chicken passable. We also shared a Georgia Salad that was very good. The restaurant is pretty small, we looked at the dining room upstairs but it was super quiet which didn't match the fun ambience and rock n' roll playing downstairs, so we sat outside. We'll be back for sure.

Having lived in Singapore for the last two and a half years I can safely say I have ate at every type of place, from Ku De Ta in MBS to the humble food court and tonight I found the best place ever.... "The Beast"..strange name I know...it calls itself a Southern Kitchen and Bourbon Bar. Looking at the menu I thought..."typical bar food". My wife and I decided to order a selection of starters and a main course.We ordered Buffalo Wings (Hot), Maryland Crab Cakes and Mozzarella Sticks....I was not expecting any thing special...but I was shocked to find that it was absolutely outstanding. I mean seriously good. For main course my wife ordered the Blackened Pork Collar served with fine beans and mash potato and I ordered the southern fried chicken with coleslaw. Again I was blown away. The pork was to die for and the chicken was so tender and juicy. Its not the cheapest place but it's by no means the most expensive. The service is out of character for Singapore in that's it's very good. I would definitely recommend this as the place to go if you are looking for exceptional food that is not too fancy

Go for brunch and try the Mac & Cheese burger. Though it's not conventional Southern food, the tasty Ma buns make up for it. There's also a great mimosa deal ($20 for 2 hour free flow) which is one of the best values in the city. Their Bloody Mary bar looked well stocked with all the traditional fixings, though I didn't try it myself. The Chicken and Waffles are also in that category. Try to book early, as the upstairs dining room fills up and the staff can get overwhelmed.

It seems like a battle half-won for the Chicken & Waffles ($20), a monstrous hunk of deep-fried thigh on waffles. The chicken is excellently crunchy and tender, but the golden batter was too salty and thus one can't help but chomp it down with the partially deflated waffles for a balanced flavour. As a hard truth, the chicken tasted best when doused with the bourbon maple butter sauce. The Pulled Pork Hash $18 may very well typify the savage character of a beast. Imagine strands of meat ferociously teared apart and tossed with cubed potatoes, red peppers and BBQ sauce. But this Beast seems timid at heart for the taste was uninspiring and dry. A little more simmering of the pork with apple cider vinegar and chilli pepper may awake the soul of the Beast. Like most authentic Southern sweets , the desserts here do not go easy on sugar. I appreciate the thick Oreo crust of the Mississippi Mudpie ($14) but this strength also became its weakest link when the pie layer is as stubborn as a rock.

I spent many years living in Georgia so I know what is delicious southern food! Moving to Singapore a few months ago, I have been on the search for that homey down South soul food and I have definitely found it at the Beast! This place is amazing- not only is the décor super cool and unique, the food is amazing and spot on delicious. I have been a few times now and haven’t had any issues with food or service- the staff have always been very nice and attentive, making sure to check back often if we needed anything. So far I’ve had quite a few things on the menu including the bacon mac and cheese, cornbread, maple bacon donut, chicken and waffles, pulled pork sliders, and big biscuit. Everything was really good- I really can’t pick a favorite! What I liked the most was that they made everything in-house, down to the maple syrup and bourbon. Also the food is made to order so it’s fresh and hot when served. It’s also a great place to bring friends- they have a full service bar and also live music on the weekends too. I recently took some friends who were visiting from Georgia and they were really impressed with the food and felt like they were back in the South! This has become one of my go-to spots. Definitely check this place out- great food for great value

Chicken and waffles did not disappoint. They give you a choice of either red or white meat. Also had the truffle fries, just ok. Waitress was helpful. Can't comment on the ambience coz we were there very early in the afternoon before any other customers arrived

I've been to The Beast a couple of times and the food has never disappointed always cooked to perfection the hot wings are for me the best in Singapore, the craft beers and selections of bourbon (if that's your thing) are great too! The location is a little out of the way and most of the outdoor seating is right on the street next to the main road. Service is a bit of a mixed bag sometimes good, sometimes not so good, but never bad

The Beast burger is a must-try! It fed 6 of us! It tastes as impressive as it looks.I love the fried chicken - clearly the best fried chicken in Singapore. Crispy on the outside, well seasoned and tender on the inside. I am heading back for more fried chicken. Plenty of interesting drinks to try, along with the beer on tap as well as buds in a bucket.The cocktails are pricey but the quality and price of the food more than make up for that.Live music too... With an open mic Thursday to liven things up.I would highly recommend a visit for dinner any day of the week, drinks on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays or Sunday branch from 11am to 5pm
