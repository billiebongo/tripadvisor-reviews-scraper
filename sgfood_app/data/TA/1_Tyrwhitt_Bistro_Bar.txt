They also show football games.

It was packed but pretty cosy. Tower of Carlsberg was at $48 and the food was pretty decent and reasonably priced. Will definitely consider going back there again although parking could be pretty difficult.

great customer service, but food was normal. ordered the truffles pizza and normal fries; pizza was not too bad, werent stingy with toppings, fries was crunchy and hot. a good place for after-hours drinks.

Good ambience with reasonable price food. Nice decorations and not noisy. Good for gathering with friends.

Happy hour till 9pm. Food is pretty decent but the waiting time is longer than expected even with food like Soup and Salad

Everything was good, except the service we received. The staff were busy talking among themselves and my male friend's pork chop was served with fork and spoon instead of fork and knife. My female friend had to request for plain water twice before she was served a cup

Its worth the trip! Tried the salmon main course. Skin was smoky and flavorful! Salad was alright, grilled vegetables were smoking and the mash potatoes were smooth. Also had their new addition of fish skin finger foods. Their tiramisu was the best I've ever had in a long time. Strong and robust and not too creamy. Its a new place & a nice place to hang out. Would come again for the other main courses

Clearly a locals bar, but very friendly and great service to a couple of foot weary tourists. Went in only for a drink but the Truffle egg pizza was great change of food pace and we stayed and glad we did. If you are nearby go in.

It was just a casual meal. My friend ordered the salmon and I ordered steak.
The food was superb. Especially the salmon, super worth the price.
Will definitely bring my salmon lover friends there to give this dish a try :)

Good hangout place with great service by the staffs. Highly recommend place for drinks after work or during weekends to chill out. Decent priced drinks as well

Food was average. Ordered mushroom risotto, the rice used don't seems to be the "risotto rice". It's long and soft. I guess the flavour is too rich. Only manage to finish half a bowl.
The chicken chop was normal as well.

My lady and I were given a table near the counter, which we find kind of in the way. However, a young man gladly granted our request to be seated further inside.We went there for their pizzas. Thin-crusted and unique ingredients (e.g. truffles), just what we wanted for gourmet pizzas. There was a rowdy bunch at the drinking section that night, so it can get noisy even when you're on the other side of the restaurant. Will likely try the beer tower another night

I was here for jus a barcardi rum ice cream. On days when I do not feel like drinking, I had a alcoholic ice cream tt really makes me feel as good as drinking. The ice cream is really delicious. Walking distance to mustafa is a bonus !
