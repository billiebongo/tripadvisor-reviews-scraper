We had a delicious dinner with cocktails, wine and dessert. Main course was cooked perfectly. The location inside the Flower Dome next door to Cloud Forest provided a unique ambiance. Staff was friendly. The host was very helpful is getting us a table as quickly as possible. Reservations and walk-ins are accepted

We booked a table at pollen for the 15th of Feb for pre Chinese new year celebrations, after being recommended by a friend. Needless to say we were very disappointed. We were seated to a messy table (not prepared with required cutlery) and rushed to order a meal along with our drinks at 8pm (The website states last order must be submitted by at 9:30pm). We ordered 2 pastas, beef cheek and ribeye steak. None of the meals were presented at the same time. Pasta presented first was measly and pathetic for $26. The cheek served 7 minutes later and steak arrived a further 5 minutes thereafter. Surely this is not standard practise?? We had to then (again) asked for cutlery to be provided.Pasta was bland, cheek was too salty. Steak was great.We requested a bottle of still water for the table and only received it after asking for a third time. Waiter was rushed for no apparent reason (restaurant was not too full). Waiter did not check in with us to see if we needed anything during the meal.When we were done there was no one in sight to assist. The check took ages to arrive.We were so excited to dine at this unique venue in the flower dome and were told of Singapores' legendary service. Pollen did not represent that.If this was an ordinary restaurant a mall I could understand, but for $80 a head, we really expected more. Very disappointed

We visited Pollen as an early birthday present for my husband. The setting is good, insider the flower dome with access to walk around before/after, and the restaurant isn't too noisy despite the passing visitors (the restaurant opens into the dome itself). We asked to move tables further into the restaurant and the team were very accommodating. We went for the unlimited prosecco option, which was good value for money given the high price of alcohol in Singapore. The service was a little slow to begin with and we had to catch the attention of the waiters once or twice, but they were all friendly and helpful and came over quickly once they realised we wanted to speak to them. In particular Dax, the general manager, was very professional. The food was delicious - we loved all of it and were totally stuffed by the end! The team also kindly brought out a happy birthday treat with a candle for our table, which was a lovely touch. Would recommend for a special occasion, either as a couple or with a group of friends

Surprisingly not too busy on Valentines day for lunch. Lovely ambience and friendly service. Three course lunch was reasonably priced, and all the food was delicious. The apple tarte tatin is to die for. Buggy pick up and drop off service, and free entry to Flower Dome too

Wow, wow, wow! Just returned from a holiday in Singapore and after visiting the gardens of the bay my niece and I decided on the spur of the moment to have lunch at this restaurant by the entrance. The service was impeccable from start to finish and the staff did everything possible to make our visit a culinary dining experience. We were given informative descriptions of the dishes on offer when making our selections, and again when the dishes were brought to the table. Complimentary amuse-bouches added a special touch and made the whole dining experience a memorable one for us. The menu was imaginative and the food beautifully presented. As my niece's 40th birthday was approaching we decided to add the free flow Prosecco offer to the set menu option we selected and our glasses were kept topped up by an attentive maitre d'.We had an active 17 month toddler in tow who chose to wake up from his nap the minute we entered the restaurant but the environment proved to be child-friendly and all of the staff showed an understanding and helpful attitude which meant we were able to relax and enjoy a leisurely meal. A highchair was brought quickly to the table and we were even moved to the adjoining table which offered a bit more space. Another waitress whisked the pushchair away until we needed it on our departure.The icing on the cake came at the end of the meal when our waitress said we could visit the kitchen and personally pass our compliments on to the English chef if we wished. We most certainly did wish.

Place - Nice and cool with lots of natural light (during lunch) and surrounded by flora and fauna within the Flower Dome. Food - Appetisers and mains in general were decent but the desserts were a little more exciting; try the Banana jelly and ice cream with salted gula melaka mousse or the lemon thyme creme brulee. Service - Very good without being too intrusiv
1
A very unfriendly welcome is all you get when you dare to enter this sacred place, from a very snooty young manager who doesn t know anything about service or even education.Stay away from the glacial ambiance, and it s a shame because the style and location are great.Too bad they don t hire the proper staff
4
Very nice lunch at pollen.The service was very attentive, the bread was freshly baked and delicious. The 3 course set menu for lunch at $65 is very affordable and worthy.All the dishes were using fresh vegetables, decoration and tastes were amazing. I definitely recommend to go there
5
All I can say is that we are staying for 6 nights in Singapore. On our first day we had the most wonderful lunch here and so happy were we that we decided to eat lunch here again on Thursday before proceeding to the airport for our flight back to Europe. What better praise
1
Got food poisoning at the afternoon tea. Sent the restaurant an email notifying them. Never heard back. Service is indifferent at best.
5
Had my birthday dinner in Pollen, it was a great place for celebration and family gatherings. Service was good and the flower dome definitely worth to visit
5
We decided to visit Pollen on our trip to the gardens by the bay just for coffees and snacks,the manager was particularly helpful and brought our coffee very quickly with the cakes we chose both were fantastic,it's nice to get good coffee in pleasant surroundings
1
Visited Pollen for the first and last time with a larger group. The food is excellent, but the sales tactics ruined the experience for me. Went home with rather chilling memories. If you like places with soul, you better keep looking.

What a fabulous spot in the flower dome to sit there is a downstairs are and upstairs which is a little less formal. They get very busy and do take reservations and may have to wait for a table. Actually upstairs also you see more of the flowers. Lovely menu and some nice nibbles too but it is pricey. The olives and manchego was lovely and the fabulous cold beer served in a metal tankard a lovely touch. Service was good and although it isn’t cheap lovely place to stop.
3
Lots of gorgeous ambiance here, and the food and little extra tastings that the restaurant provided throughout the meal were delicious. It was our first night in SG and we wanted to try to keep the dinner short so everyone could rest so we only ordered two courses. The light dinner took over 2.5 hours, and the restaurant was freezing due to the cold air needed for the gardens next door. My advice is to take a sweater and plan to be there a while, and I think you’ll enjoy it.

I had once in a lifetime surprise arranged for my partner and Pollen restaurant staff went over and above to accommodate me. I have to mention two names Susannah and Christine. Both are just amazing human beings I ever came across. They both ensured we have such a great time that we come back here every time we are in Singapore. The suggested food from the menu was just awesome and they even gave us special treat due to our special day. I am so glad I picked this restaurant and I got to meet the two nicest ladies Susannah Christine and everyone at the Pollen. I had fine dining experience around the world but to me what matters are the little things the staff do that makes it special. Thank you so much Pollen .. we are coming back again !

We visited Pollen for an early evening dinner on a Monday. It was quiet - very quiet - but the food was of the high standard that we had expected from a chef who trained under Gordon Ramsay. The service was excellent and the food was inventive, as well as beautifully presented...in fact each plate was a work of art. It was expensive and was far more than we would normally pay for a meal out, but this isn't just any old restaurant in any old location. We had the set menu early evening dinner, which is far less than the a la carte and gives you a cocktail and a glass of wine with your food. You also get free entrance into the flower dome (but be aware, it closes around 9pm so you'll need to either eat early or visit before you dine) and there's a free shuttle that picks you up from the entrance to the visitor centre in the Bay of Gardens. One tiny niggle...we stood for ages waiting for the shuttle - in fact we could have walked in less time! But that aside, it was a fantastic and memorable evening. I'd go back if I had the chance

My parents were visiting Singapore and we combined a trip to Gardens by the Bay with dinner at Pollen. We all loved the setting, great staff, delicious food. My boyfriend and I are vegan, so they modified the main for us - was very jealous of my parents’ shared beef wellington and dessert though! The presentation was lovely.Great cocktails.Yes it’s expensive, but it’s a nice treat and a good venue for combining a walk around the supertrees at night. A little chilly in the dome after a while and my dad was in a particularly drafty spot. The trick is to layer
1
We were extremely excited to book dinner at Pollen whilst on Honeymoon but we were very disappointed. There was no atmosphere in the restaurant, the staff were on the edge of being completely rude and obviously did not want to be there. The cocktails were had very bland and took ages to arrive. The food was extremely average and disappointing - and look nothing like the website picture, no pride in presentation at all in reality. There are plenty of other amazing restaurants in Singapore which I would suggest visiting instead. Would not recommend at all
4
Came on a weekday for dinner, god service throughout. Food was good for its price, nice ambience and spacing, interesting menu, including vegetarian.
5
Had the three course lunch menu for $55. Excellent value and very high quality. Fresh, creative and tasty. Great service. Also included free entrance to flower dome!
1
I would advise you to go to Pollen for a piece of cake and a cup of tea, and then enter the Flower Dome for free. Avoid the mains. The lunch was horrid stuff, and I have a feeling half the people in Pollen were using the entertainer app. Even with the one-for-one entertainer, the food was barely worth it.
5
Enjoyed dinner here after visiting the flower dome. Didn't expect to actually have dinner inside the flower dome itself but we stumbled upon Pollen and thought we would give it a try. The terrace was our preferred dining option as we wanted something a bit more relaxed over their formal dining room. We received excellent service and had good recommendations by our waitress. The food was tasty and we enjoyed both the starters and mains. Glad we gave it a try, felt a bit special and exclusive eating in the flower dome

This restaurant was inside Gardens By The Bay and I had lunch there on a rainy Saturday! The volunteers at the Bay helped to inform the restaurant and they arranged pick up! Ambience was good and there were lots of greens! The vegan / vegetarian menu was really limited and I ordered grilled winter vegetables! It was a bit pricey though! We walked past the Dome on our way out after lunch!

We were at the Flower Dome attraction at The Gardens by the Bay and noticed this restaurant off to one corner so, we thought we would check it out. I didn't think much at first as I thought it was just a coffee/cake type place to rest while taking in the attraction. We found out there is a "downstairs" restaurant with an entirely different menu including halibut, salmon, roast duck among other items. They have a separate door from the outside to get in without having to buy a ticket to the Flower Dome. Anyway, we got a reservation and came back at 6:30 PM. My partner had the halibut that he thought was very good with a great sauce he really liked. He started with a salad of tomatoes and burata which is a type of cheese he would have again. I had the fixed price meal with a salad of several bits of tomato, olive and several other things. Sorry, I know that isn't very descriptive but, it was good none the less. They paired a rhubarb drink with it that was interesting.... I had the duck both poached and roasted for my main. I did like it both ways for sure. I only wish I had an extra piece of duck. It was accompanied by a disk of barley...good! They poured a glass of syrah wine paired for the duck that went well. Only wished she would have not been so stingy with the pour! Desert comes with my meal so, I had lemon chiffon type frozen desert with a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top. The waitress dusted the top with long pepper saying that it added an added touch of something. OK... Really didn't do anything for it but, making a bit of a production with it was to impress the diner. Not many people know what long pepper is vs regular black pepper but, I do and I would not think of putting it on vanilla ice cream. OK...the whole experience was that the staff, including Dax the manager and Kathleen and others were good...nice people. Food was very good although, I could have used a few more bites. Pricing....was a bit expensive, we thought but then, we rationalized it by doing all our own tours instead of Viator etc which saved us a couple hundred dollars so, we could afford it.

I was here as part of a large group for a business lunch. The staff handled everything very well, accommodating some fussy dietary restrictions discreetly and quite deliciously.The ground-floor location within the Flower Dome is such that the cool air from the dome settles into the restaurant, making it surprisingly cold despite being in a tropical city. There were even space heaters available to warm people's feet - it was that chilly. But I found it a refreshing escape from the heat outside
2
The gardens are wonderful to visit, we popped into the terrace for tea and a bite to eat. The restaurant only had 3 tables full, lots of room left but even though the manager acknowledged us it took him 8mins to seat us. We ordered and it took 35 mins to receive a cheese plate and humus. In the meantime we were served someone else's order and had it taken away (same thing we ordered) I found the manager incredibly rude and very flustered. He was very dismissive to the other servers and bar staff and outright rude to the new girl working. The new girl was wonderful and very embarrassed for the situation. The cheese plate was not worth the money charged, very small portion but the humus was wonderful
5
Amazing time spent here. It is our memorable day 6 January. Staffs made our day extra special. Arrived earlier at 2:45pm , we were told to walk flower dome first while they are setting up the restaurant for hi tea. Came back after the dome and we are seated at the farthest area almost close to the walkway to the toilet. Anyways they are full. We were served by our afternoon tea and free flow Prosecco. Service were attentive, though it is cold in the restaurant we anticipated it as a local. Next table seated to us kept complaining about their food being cold, because they keep on taking photos of the food, hilarious. Ashamed as they are local too. They even complained about exchanging their hi tea to main courses as hot dishes. Lor. It entertainment for us in a while. I feel bad to the staff as the family were abusive. Our favourite in our hi tea is the scones they are made fresh we were told, though it is cold it is delicious. We will come back in fact made a booking next week Saturday . Will come back for more Prosecco a value for money offer free flow.

Had high tea with friends at Pollen. One good thing is that buggy service is available so you don’t have to walk 20 mins to the restaurant. The place is beautiful but food was alright, just that it wasn’t served hot. High tea had sweets and savory. Savory selection was not too bad except that the beef on the beef tart was hard and chewy (on top of being cold) and salmon tart tasted fishy. The rest of savory selection was alright. The sweet selection was awfully sweet (on top of being cold). We had a lot of leftovers of it. On top of these above mentioned, the service was bad. Probably didn’t have enough manpower. When we arrived we changed our minds and wanted to order mains instead because we were very hungry (although we booked for high tea). Was told that floor 2 doesn’t serve mains during 3-5pm (high tea time) only floor 1 serve mains. Manager told us that we have to call (when manager could just check it for us with staff downstairs) to check if there are any seats available. So we asked manager to check but it was fully reserved. After our high tea we walked out of the restaurant and saw a all day menu outside the restaurant. So we went back and asked the manager why we were denied ordering mains when they had an all day menu. Manager said that the food is only served during 12.00 - 1.30pm. After further probing manager said lunch hours starts from 11.30 - 2.30pm. What a difference! He even told us website is not updated so it wasn’t clear. And he will update management about this (we felt like we were being brushed off). The website has been like this since their first day, furthermore he wasn’t even clear of the mains timing. We will never go back to this place for food again!

Stopped over while in the Flower Dome. We took bruschettas with burrata and tomatoes and fritters with aioli sauce. The food was great but the service was slow and the waiter didn’t know the menu and the dishes. The house wine was good though.
4
Hidden towards the back of the Flower Dome is this cafe. Nice selection of snacks, they make a very good coffee.
Staff are attentive and efficient. A great way to take a quiet break in a beautiful setting.
5
Pollen is a fabulous restaurant which attends to the detail in food, wine and service. It was a memorable meal. Note that the restaurant has a cool temperature as it is in the flower dome so dress appropriately so you remain comfortable. Highly recommend.
4
The restaurant has a nice ambience and there is also complimentary entrance to the Flower Dome after dinner.
4
The food was excellent- we had the Iberico pork and Octopus. Both items were very well prepared- tender and flavorful.
The appetizer truffle salad was meh! The seasoning was Sweet and ‘nothingness’
However the tomato salad was very good- tangy and Sweet with nice dressing.
5
Food excellent, wine good, service first class (attentive but not claustrophobic).
Only problem was that the AC was on at too low a temperature - we were really cold. Clearly the restaurant is used to this as they were handing out blankets to diners!
3
If you come to the gardens via the restaurant, admission to the Flower Dome is complimentary. So, if you have paid for entrance to the Flower Dome, then the food price will look a bit expensive. The selection on the menu is quite limited. I would have preferred a more balanced meal with sufficient protein, fiber and carbohydrate source. The food tastes fine but there is nothing special about it. Serving size is small. Of course if you like the cold temperatures, it is a great place to dine. It will feel much colder on a rainy or very cloudy day (which is what we experienced). The waiter/waitress is hard to find. They are somehow never near you. If you are a member, you can get further discount on food. To get here, you can take the buggy from the information counter
5
As soon as we finish working at The Affordable Art Fair in Singapore's F1 Pit Building in November we make our way to the Gardens By the Bay and the lovely Pollen Restaurant inside one of the large domes. We always receive a warm welcome. Taking the lunch menu of the day the chef always delights us with his creative and delicious dishes. Highly recommend this for a business lunch and equally for couples or families. Can't wait to go back next November!!A free golf buggy collects you from the entrance to the gardens once you have been dropped off by your taxi or have parked your car
4
The best 'fine-dining' restaurant in Singapore with excellent vegan options - in my opinion. Do request and book in advance if you decide to have a meal here - they have a separate vegetarian menu - which can be veganised by request. The staff are well-trained, and they know the difference between vegetarian and vegan. Booking in advance also includes a complimentary entry to the flowers by the bay - a.k.a flower dome, and a small vehicle to pick you up from Gardens by the Bay information point. Food wise, their bread and hummus were on point, excellent risotto, and solid ice cream dessert - I can't remember what's the appetizer though
4
My friends visited this restaurant for dinner, food was nice and well presented. Ambience and view is nice too. As this restaurant is located inside the Flower Dome, it's really cold (so please dress up accordingly if u are type of person who can't stand cold).Customer service could be better, they finally served us ice water after we asked for like...more than 3 times?! Yeah maybe because Ice Water is FOC so they didn't want to entertain us, but still, this is a high end restaurant, so hey staff you should behave and represent the restaurant well
5
warm welcome, great service and nice setting, always nice to finish the greta meal with a walk in the floral doom. ordered set menu ... all good except a mild disappointment with the NZ cod. otherwise all perfect.
5
What can I say! From the buggy service pick up to transporting us to the restaurant, from a welcoming door girl, a warmth welcome, it's like arriving in a exclusive place. We had the tasting menu 5 stories and it was amazing from start to finish. Service was top notch. Detailed service. Our server Kee is well knowledgeable every dish he explains. Good wine selection. GM of the restaurant visited us on the table and personalize the experience. Kudos to the team of Pollen. We will be back for more and will bring our party back.
4
The hightea set is decent and it comes with free entrance to the flower dome, which is a bonus point for family with kids. Do bring along jacket as the temperature of the restaurant is rather low since its is connected to the flower dome. Overall this is a satisfying experience
4
The restaurant is located inside Flower Dome with nice view. We booked through Chope 2 weeks ago and they called us back for confirmation. The person on call was very impatient when we ask about car park and buggy service. Eventually we weren't able to find the buggy service but was told we can walk to restaurant straight. No one was attending us as they are all busy with own stuffs even though the restaurant is only half full.The staffs in second floor were very nice, they attended to us, help us arrange seats and served us ASAP with nice smile :)) Food and view were both nice. Will give a 5 star if they can improve their service. [We read comments online before going to the restaurant and most of the comment complain about the poor service so we kinda prepared for it. That's why not too disappointed and give 4 stars lol

I went to Pollen for having Afternoon tea, we require to book in advance and pay SGD 50 deposit via their website. I had an intention to redeem my gift voucher.My first impression, service level was super bad, nobody approached me for picking up order for more than 15 mins, and they was seated me in the corner near exit gate, thankfully another waiter was able to accomodate my request and moved me to other table. Things that make me so upset was they reject my voucher and just deduct the payment from my deposit, then I ended up with unable to clear my voucher, the voucher itself will be expired within 3 months, I am foreigner who doesn’t come too frequent to SGRestaurant GM (Mr. Dax Taparan) promised me to extend voucher expiry date and asked me to send email to him for my later visit. I will wait and see whether the GM really keep his words or notOnce I redeem my voucher, I definitely won’t be back to this restaurant, price too expensive, service level very bad and taste wise is very standar
5
The standard of food in Singapore is generally great, but I find a lot of restaurants are all doing the same kind of "great"..... sharing plate concepts etc. Both my partner and I thought the food at this place was exceptional even by Singapore's high standards. A really unique dinner. Just note the place is quite cool inside as it's inside the flower dome which gets kept at a certain temperature. Look forward to going back and trying the tasting menu next time. I'm surprised the place doesn't have more 5 start reviews although it seems most the complaints relate the service at the more casual cafe upstairs perhaps
3
Food was OK. Liked the savory items more than the overly sweet ones. Had to ask for the bill twice, and it finally came after a wait of close to 15 minutes. The Flower Dome was a cool and delightful place for a walk after the heavy meal.
4
Celebrated my hubby birthday. Great food, nice atmosphere although a little cold for me. The restaurant is thoughtful to prepare a shawl for guests, in case you feel a little cold there. Thereafter, we can also explore the flower dome which is inclusive. Overall, is worth a visit

We had our team bonding tea session on a Friday afternoon. This place is nestled in the Flower Dome at Gardens By The Bay.As there were 15 of us, so were requested to make a booking & pay a deposit. We were expecting to bond amongst the flora & fauna but it was not to be.We were extremely disappointed with the seating assigned. We were placed smack in front of the lift on the 2nd floor, huddled around 2 small tables! What’s worse, the seats were right beneath the glass dome. It was literally sun tan seats on a sweltering afternoon! We asked for a change of seating & after a wait, was reassigned to the lower floor but was told we only had an hour (!) to finish our tea as they had to prepare for dinner crowd. We asked for an extension & was given another 1/2 hour till 5:30pm instead. The tea time set was $38/pax with refillable tea or coffee. Service was below average & inattentive, we had to ask for refills. Food was passable, sweet snacks were too sweet while savory ones were more palatable. By the time we left the place at 5:30pm, there was not a single dinner table filled..

Myself and some friends booked into have High Tea at Pollen in the Flower Dome the other day. The venue is beautiful, we were there on a sunny day and the air inside the Flower Dome is cool and crisp. My friends are Vegetarian so they opted for the Vegetarian Menu, although when we booked we did ask if there was a vegan menu but nothing was available. I myself got the regular menu. For High Tea and unlimited tea and coffee it costs 34++ per pax (there are more expensive options of Mulled Wine and free flow wine for 2 hours). I thought it was quite good value for money considering the venue and style of afternoon tea - myself and my friends left surprisingly full. The only thing that let down the experience was the staff. When we were there is was quite busy and it seemed to be under staffed. None kept there eye on our table to check if we needed more tea or new plates and it was even hard to get hold of someone to pay the bill. Considering it was free flow tea and coffee, we only had someone come and refill our tea pots once and trying to get hold of a coffee was practically impossible. Also they didn't have any soy milk or non dairy milk to accommodate those with non dairy diets. So overall an average day at Pollen, wish the service was a little better but the food was still good and there was a large selection of tea and coffee to choose from. Last tip: If you arrive at the gardens from the taxi stand, there is a shuttle that will take you straight to the restaurant - its a little bit of a walk to get to so would recommend taking the shuttle
4
High tea set was very filling. Savouries fared better than the sweets. Good that coffee and tea were free flow but coffee was too acidic.
5
We celebrated our anniversary here, really romantic and especially that we had a complimentary Garden Dome entrance with the wine pairing menu. The staff was professional and the restaurant was perfect. Immerse yourself in a gastronomy experience!
5
Had an amazing time in this cafe. The view, flowers and ambience are just amazing. We had cakes and coffee. So great we went back on the same day for drinks!
3
Greeted by a very snoby front desk attendant giving you the feeling of being totally misplaced because you have the guts to show up without a reservation for lunch (while the place was mostly empty at 02:00 pm) we went upstairs for a snack. That was good in terms of food and wine selection. And the service was real. Great views comes with the upstairs ... and you just cross over into the flower dome without paying the entrance fee
4
The ambiance was really great in the flower dome to begin with. As for the Hi-Tea set, the savoury food was very average and not really memorable. Where as the sweet treats were the main highlight of the set, everything was really good. The cranberry scones were also one of the chunkiest and best I've tasted. Overall it was good and the servers were nice.
3
The restaurant was recommended by our concierge, but it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. It’s a nice venue (if a little chilly!) and we watched the light show before dinner. Customers are also given free access to the Flower Dome. As regards the food, I thought that this was very average and with some rather odd combinations (red cabbage & cheese). It certainly wasn’t to my taste.
1
Walking around the Flower Dome at the Gardens by the Bay when we saw a sIgn advertising an All Day menu at the Pollen Terrace. Went in (5.10 pm) and asked for a menu at the table. Were then told only had cakes as kitchen didn't open until 6pm. Not sure when 'All Day' started meaning from 6pm onwards but then being European perhaps it has a different meaning in the UK, certainly the member of staff couldn't answer why they were advertising a cooked menu when the kitchen was shut. Bit of a shock as my impression of Singapore up to that point had been one of total efficiency. Went to one of the other restaurants in the Gardens that was actually serving food instead
5
The staff were friendly and welcoming, it is very cool in the restaurant and was offered a shawl, which my wife appreciated. After tea we went into the Flower Dome which is included in the price.The food was impressive and a cake wishing me a happy birthday with a candle was a very nice touch. All in all a very nice afternoon. I hope to visit again when next in Singapore

No one can possibly fault an afternoon tea at Pollen, located within the Flower Dome at the Gardens by the Bay, simply because of the wonderful ambience and cool (artificial) weather. It's like being transported to the UK for an English afternoon tea.The spread, from bite size open sandwiched, to little cakes, macaron and an oversized (and rather dry) scone, was passable. Nothing to rave about, but not too bad either.The service was a different matter - due to lack of staff. Food and drinks took extra long to arrive at the table. Had it not been a relaxing Saturday afternoon, that would have bothered me a lot more. As did the constant wandering in of Gardens visitors into the restaurant/cafe area which is not properly barricaded, peering around since there was no staff at the entrance to stop them.I cannot in all honesty give an "AVERAGE" rating only because of the location and ambience. A walk in the gardens after tea is fantastic. But minus that, the whole afternoon tea experience would just barely score AVERAGE
5
My partner had booked this restaurant as a surprise meal for my birthday and it definitely did not disappoint :) Located in the flower dome of Gardens By the Bay, it is a beautiful restaurant. The waiting staff were fantastic and we really enjoyed the beef wellington as sharing main- absolutely delicious!We would definitely recommend this restaurant- especially for a special occasion. We would love to go back and try their afternoon tea/lunch too
4
For dinner, there is an early dinner offer from 6-7 pm at more affordable prices. Come early and check it out.
5
I love Pollen and I've been here countless of times. From the personalised buggy service to the good food and ambience, everything is lovely. Remember to enjoy a nice stroll in Flower Dome thereafter! :)
4
Went there for breakfast. Reached around 11am then realised the food items are only served at 11.30am. No problem with that as the environment is so cooling. Ordered their pull pork burger and salmon. Both are delicious and nicely plated.
4
Wonderful place to take visiting friends and family. Beautiful setting, attentive service and food is better than most "fine dining" restaurants that I've tried in SG. Bonus that you get free entry to Flower Dome after, so it's well worth doing lunch there.
4
We were wondering around Garden bu the bay after the light representation at the Trees and were hesitating between restaurant. This one is definitely the best on site. French, flower inspired restaurant within the flower dome (read with free access). The food was great, we were offered a lot of goodies, we appreciated especially the butter with warm bread! The butter was simply amazing with paper and onions miammmm
5
I’ve been there at least 3 times this year & the experience is always wonderful. Good service, good food at reasonable prices for a place like this! Buggy service was a little slow sometimes & the number that was given to call- sometime no answer. But that’s just a small matter. Once you get there, you’ll forgive & forget it. For me, the idea of sipping afternoon tea, nibbling on tea cakes & open-face sandwiches, in a cool 23 degrees glass dome, surrounded by beautiful flowers & scent.... can’t go wrong! What else can one ask for....Great place to spend your afternoons if you can’t stand the heat but still want the “outdoor garden feel”. Entrance to flower dome is free when you dine here.
5
Celebrated my wife's b'day dinner here and the experience was just amazing. Tried the Potato & Leek sabayon, artichoke risotto, Kale Gnocchi. There were enough vegetarian choices and everything tasted great. Highly recommended. Comes with a complimentary entry to the Flower dome and a buggy ride from the arrival plaza

Very nice and superb beef wellington, will definetely comeback and recommend to friends and family. My first visit to the pollen. Staff are friendly and expertise in the products, explain in layman term what are the food and ingredients. Good job to service staff, managers and again to the Chefs

First, the floor manager let us wait over 15 minutes before coming to our table.Then, you are pushed into ordering a drink from one of their drink menus even before being able to see the food menu. In our case, this meant choosing bottles of wine, without being able to know with which food it needed to be paired.Third, we specifically indicated on the reservation to opt for the 3-course early dinner, but once we received the food menu, the 3-course option wasn't even provided. Instead, I had to insist on receiving this, in front of my guests.Outside that, the local floor staff was lovely and the food was good, though pricey. The price of the wine was through the roof, even for Singapore standards

Yes, it’s cold - bring kind Of proper dress.Yes, it’s expansive so, expect to spend something like 100 usd per person as minimum.Yes, the taste and complimentary appetizers are flabbergasting.Yes, stuff is up to the level. Yes, there is free shuttle and complimentary entrance to Flower Dome.No, I wouldn’t say anything against it. Once you’re rich enough to stay at Marina Bay Sands or something more expensive - that will be a restaurant for you

dined at pollen terrace. very busy place and hard to get wait staff attention.
food was above average but pricey. guess that's the price to pay in SG tourist attractions.
4
This concept of garden eating was new to me in Singapore. You can enjoy your meal and pop into the flower dome when you are done. food was excellent..even the quickly warmed gin in a tea pot. Service could have been improved. Worth a visit
4
The presentation of the food was good but I'm terms of taste, it didn't deliver as well. The wait time was rather long too.
4
We booked ahead for 3pm and were taken by a shuttle direct to the door. We were seated at a lovely window table inside, where the aircon was much appreciated. The staff were polite and our coffee and plates of savoury and sweet delectables were served promptly. We had a small issue with luke warm coffee which was quickly remedied. The food was delicious. More like a meal than an afternoon tea. Great value for money at $39++ pp which included entry to the dome. Highly recommend
5
What a wonderful way to round off a trip to Singapore - visit Pollen and have a truly fantastic meal in a superb location and served to you by friendly & cheerful people. The food was out of this world, really tasty with some really different combinations. All in all a really enjoyable meal in a fantastic city - thank you

Went to cafe within the dome on Saturday afternoon tea. Walked in with no reservation and thankfully there was one table available. Was informed that ala carte menu was not available and that we had to order the HIGH TEA Set. 10 min later a Caucasian family sat opposite us at a table and was offered the ala carte menu. 15 min later a Thai family with a reservation came as was told they could only order the high tea set. I asked the manager if Asians were only allowed to order the high tea set and not allowed to order ala carte. I was then told that walk-in customers did not have to order the high tea set and customers who made pre reservations had to order the high tea set. Obviously the waiter was ill informed or dishonest. Worst of all he did not even bother to apologise.
1
The food selection was mediocre and dismal. The service was tardy too, need to ask the service crew at least 3 times before water was topped up for the tea. It is definitely not worth the price ($44 per pax). Strongly not recommended. The only saving grace is the free visit to flower dome.
1
Unfortunately the crab bisque was warm ( not hot enough) and the rib eye steak with mash and a quarter of portobello mushroom cold, even if we asked the waiter to warm it up, the food come back to the table 5 minutes later cold. For a Â£20 rib eye steak cold I definitely don't recommend this place. They should take care more about the food.I had my coffee without cleaning the table...no good guys
3
There is a lot written about the location, the decor and the food. Yes it is a very interesting experience but would I truly call it out of the world? Not really. It's like a good restaurant that is pricey and serves small portions. No, it isn't value for money. No, it isn't a restaurant to put on your 10-must-visit-before-I-die list. It's an average restaurant in a not so average location serving slightly above average food for the most part. I love chocolate and I love orange chocolate. But the dessert platter here made me want to reach for milk chocolate. The orange chocolate is SOUR!!! It's actually some sort of cruel joke of a chocolate because the over powering taste of orange masks everything. To boot there is some sort of sick tasting dollop of ice cream. It was so horrible that my mind has blocked it's taste. Sorry folks at Pollen. The dessert really let me down
2
I made an on-line booking for afternoon tea at Pollen. We were there at 4:30. The waiter gave us the menu and we tried to order immediately because we were hungry. However, we were then advised that their kitchen was closed at 4pm.During we had our drink there, a lot of guest walked-in and left because there was nothing can eat. When I left the restaurant, I noted that they have an All Day Menu signage at the entrance of the restaurant. ??
4
We were there for lunch and was worried about the amount of food. Turn out we were stuffed after the meal. We added 5 types of cheese to the course meal that was available. The cheese was decent. Bakery and desserts are thumb up!
5
Good location, good food , good taste, good price, everything is good but if would be better if have some promotion sometimes
3
despite being in the flower dome it doesn't really capitalise on the potential views. You are surrounded by herbs but not many flowers. If they had lots of flowers it would be magnificent.
5
love the fact that Pollen is located at the Gardens by the Bay and inside the Flower Dome. I have been wanting to visit the flower dome but never got round to it. finally we decided to come for lunch. there is a buggy service at the entrance of the Gardens if you don't want to walk there. it was a short ride, and fun. the restaurant is relatively small and cosy but the tables are pretty well spaced. the service was great. i was offered a shawl when i arrived, as the place is pretty cold. we took the 3 course set lunch which came with extremely delicious bread (nice and warm) and some small snacks. the servers were attentive, i got my cup of hot water filled up without asking. when the dishes arrived, they explained what it was. the food is superb - very delicious and well plated - we truly enjoyed our meal. loved the chocolates given at the end of the meal. we also took a walk in the dome through the second level (lift). i love the flowers in restaurant, an excellent overall experience. glad we came
5
Pollen is situated in the Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay. With the reservation, you get free access to the dome to explore before dinner. Get there a little before your reservation to spend time wandering the flowers! The restaurant itself is cosy and small, with a varied menu and wine list. Prices are high, but the food is superb. Don't forget a jumper as they keep the restaurant cool in line with the dome!
5
We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Nice, quiet ambience when we arrived. If you're looking for vegetarian options, ask for a vegetarian menu like we did. We had a 3-course lunch set and a vegetarian tasting menu. All in all an enjoyable experience at Pollen
2
The location of the restaurant is brilliant. For the price that we are charged, I do expect exceptional service and amazing food. Unfortunately on both counts, this restaurant disappointed us.We are a group of 4, there is a table for 2 free which can sits 4 if only the original waiter bother to search for chairs. Ultimately we have to ask for a different waiter before we get our chairs.We were there for afternoon tea. The presentation of the cake is Nothing to wow about. Some of the cakes are very sweet.Unfortunately I would give it a miss. Avoid
5
We came upon this gem while exploring the Flower Dome at Gardens By The Bay. At first we were concerned about the high cost of lunch here. It is a high-class restaurant located in a casual type atmosphere (Attached to the Flower Dome) and often these types of restaurant tend to disappoint me, since I work in the restaurant business and have eaten at many a fine restaurant. No disappoint here! The lunch was excellent and the service was top-notch. We did not have any wine (a mistake?) as the inventive hot whiskey drinks we ordered were disappointing. IT was the only thing. Presentations and food tastes were spot on. Worth the price of admission

It's not often that you get to enjoy fine dining that makes you feel classy and special and yet at home all at once. Pollen manages to do just that with its exquisite creations that make you feel warm and homely. It's certainly not the temperature in the restaurant, set at a constant 20 degrees Celsius due to it being part of the Flower Dome with complimentary access to it, and which allows you to dress up for once in warm and humid Singapore. It's something to do with Executive Chef Steve Allen's specially curated menu to celebrate Pollen's 5th anniversary. Chef Allen draws inspiration from his varied experiences, including his childhood, and the homely yet exquisite taste really comes through in dishes such as Langoustine & lardo, and Sea & sand. The first dish of Pollen's Garden is made up of 16 different types of herbs and vegetables and one experiences a cacophony of flavours bursting forth in the mouth with each bite! Lardo was a first-time experience for many of us and a most interesting one. It's like the fatty part of Jamon ham, yet is not so rich as to be nauseating. Sea & sand in particular left a deep impression, creatively told through the blue plate representing the sea and foam representing the sand. The salmon that came with the dish was so beautifully done - lightly torched on the outside but still sashimi raw on the inside, retaining all the natural flavour and juiciness of the fish. It was truly melt in the mouth. Each of the 5 courses comes with a story, on a small strip of paper embedded with sunflower seeds that you can plant, thoroughly befitting of the restaurant's place in the Gardens by the Bay.This was truly an unforgettable experience, and judging by it, a precursor of more to come

Finally tried their afternoon tea with my partner on my birthday and we both loved the ambiance and beautiful atmosphere! We both felt as thought we were Alice in Wonderland! Just the right about of food to find yourself in a food coma. Service - although friendly - was not easily available as most of the tables were filled and they accepted a lot of walk ins every few minutes. Perhaps hiring more floor staff would do the trick!
3
We visited the POLLEN restaurant for lunch. Lovely food, tastefully presented.. BUT.. the service was painfully slow. Not just for your us but others also. In fact it was the topic of conversation with our fellow diners.
4
Pollen is a great spot for a refreshment or bite to eat before you head off and explore these magnificent Gardens by the Bay,
5
A collaboration event between Pollen and Mume wth 4 executive chefs creating a menu showcasing Mediterranean and South east Asian cuisine.
Tasty snacks preluded an 8 course tasting menu with matching wines. Superb quality throughout and hope Steve Allen repeats the event!!
4
Nice restaurant inside flower house not very big menu,not small prices,but very cozy and tasty!Also very beautiful city view,glass roof,unfortunately that's all(
5
Lovely dining experience with floral scents that brings up the mood for the experience. Love it. But do note that it seems like afternoon tea sets are fixed - one per pax.
5
presentation service and food where all wonderful, definitely recommend to others who appreciate great food attentive staff ,without knowing they where there which is the perfect way to be.
will be back
1
After a fantastic 4 hours at gardens by the bay we desperately wanted a drink , sit down & something to eat. Saw Pollen & sat down. Waited quite a while to be acknowledged eventually had to approach staff for service. We ordered 3 snack plates and was unhappy with skimpy offering. The food was also long in coming as well. Would not recommend it!!
4
The tickets to the Flower Dome enticed us to try the restaurant. Overall experience was good. For us, the restaurant was very cold. Dinner took almost 4 hours for the tasting menu. Creative chef with very good service. Quality and special occasion venue. They lost me when they said, "the wine pairings, are not all wines". But had a generally enjoyable evening. For us, it was a one time only experience. Nothing wrong with that..
4
Decided to do a lunch at the flower dome-Pollen as dining there includes admission to the Flower Dome, via their own private lift. First time here but surprisingly child-friendly. Stokke high chair was prepared for the little one and they even have a child-seat toilet and wash basin, and of course a child-menu. Food was good and the little one asked for cheese, which is about $8 per slide, presented with crackers and jam. Very nice. But not sure why they do not have children cutlery and bowls/cups. Nonetheless we had a slow and easy lunch before going for a stroll at the flower dome. Very nice. The manager was exceptionally hospitable and knowledgeable about the food. He was also very kind and helpful to our little one. Tips: Call just before arrival so they could send the buggy early to pick you from the plaza or outside the majestic restaurant. It's quite walk to the entrance
5
My husband and I had afternoon tea which was delightful! We also received free admission to the flower dome with our reservation which was a wonderful experience! Definitely make a reservation so you'll receive the free admission and also secure a spot. The atmosphere at Pollen is so welcoming and relaxing, and the food was also terrific! We will be sure to return when in Singapore again
3
Somehow the standard seems to not measure up to past experience. Waiters less attentive and less patient, more forgetful about orders ...
5
The restaurant is located beneath the flower dome and it serves very nice modern French cuisine. The 5-course lunch is a great deal. My favourite is the Apple tarte tatin served with almond ice cream, which is absolutely heavenly.
1
Visited Pollen today with my family and was very disappointed with the High Tea experience. Both the savoury and sweet options lacked flavour and were mostly tasteless. The service was also poor and therefore I would not recommend it.
5
Lovely lovely ambience and really sweet service!
Amazing experience at Pollen cause my girlfriend and I wanted to posh it up a little and food and drinks and everything fancy aside, please do have one (or more) of their apple tarte tatin.
Nuff said.
5
Great ambience with beautiful background. Ordered the tasting set dinner and it was delicious and filling. Go for their specialty apple pie with salted almond ice cream which was really yummy!
5
Good food options as we have had a vegan on our table as well. Since you dining in the restaurant you get the access to the gardens as well. It is a bit cold inside the restaurant but they provide shawls which is a nice gesture. All in all a great experience !
4
Love the environment and the food. Just be aware of the sunshine and heat if you arrive around lunch and you may want to avoid the upper floor. The food is great with a taste of South Asia. Serving staff is largely great but hard to get their attention after the peak hour(maybe there were busy cleaning the tables). I waited for half an hour but the waiter didn't respond. and finally I have to walk over to ask for the bill. Other than this, everything was grea
5
Visited Pollen for my best friend's birthday lunch. Buggy pick up service was provided and easily located as I came up from the basement carpark. The team arranged a window seat for us as per requested and service provided by the team was perfect. Thank you so much!
1
Pollen is located in an awesome venue. However, the staff exudes a very stern, rude attitude. Ever since we walked in, we didn't even get any smile! We were early for afternoon tea but I told them my mom needs to have a small bite and the lady kept saying they'll start at 3pm and we can visit the dome first. I said I know but I want to grab a small bite for her.When we got to the terrace, another rude waiter told us our table isn't ready. There were about 5 tables that are empty that will be used for afternoon tea. I said we need to eat before the afternoon tea, just my mom and me and the rest can walk around. They still insisted we sit on the counter.For a supposed upscale restaurant, this is very very poor form. I used to love this restaurant. This might be my last visit
3
Was very excited to visit Pollen inside the Flower Dome of the Garden by the Bay for lunch. Menu is limited but delicious. Was a little disappointed with the wine selection. Had the salmon and it was outstanding. Would have liked the service to be a little more attentive and focused on the customer. Overall not too bad consider the location inside the Flower Dome, but please don't think bad service is ok just because of location location location
5
Gorgeous atmosphere
Tapas generous for price in such a special spot.
Well worth a little sit down during a walk around the gardens
5
Loved the food. The food was so delicious. ESP the salmon , perfect with the lemon zest and whipped potato. Will definitely go back.
2
We came here for a drink and a bite to eat, the service was below average and the food was overpriced.
3
Great place for a cold beer and a glass of wine during happy hour, while walking round the flower dome. The bread and hummus at $8 was good value but the olives at $15 maybe not!!!! Service ok.
5
Just all round wonderful experience w the 3 course lunch menu. Cool seating, free entry in the flower dome, uniquely delicate and delicious food
5
I had lunch at Pollen with my husband and 3-year-old son after visiting the Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay. The ambience of the restaurant was excellent, service was super, and most importantly, they do provide a kids' menu. I ordered a penne with tomato sauce for my son, and he loved it. It's actually his first time almost finishing up a meal by himself too.After we left Singapore, my son kept asking me to make the same pasta for him. So I emailed Pollen, and surprisingly, I got a reply in 2 days with a recipe. I really appreciate what Pollen has done for me and will definitely visit again next time we are in Singapore
3
The Afternoon teatime set was average, we both thought maybe we should had just walk-in and pick desserts from shelf and other Ala-carte in the menu instead of making reservations, this is our first time visiting around the area (Garden by the bay). However, the atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant and unique and the staff did a good job on pick-up and majority the service is ok
4
Pollen is located next to Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay and diners get complimentary access to Flower Dome. The restaurant is a small cosy area where diners get natural sunlight (in air con environment) while you enjoy lunch, high tea, coffee/tea. I enjoyed the high tea set as well as their lunch menu. The rib eye was done well and paired well with the peppercorn sauce. Price wise, it's mid-range and members of entertainer app gets to enjoy their main course one-for-one
4
We had a lunch in restaurant Pollen, in the Flower Dome of Gardens by the Bay. We lunch menu is very good, with some options to choose. One thing we find a bit odd, the water was refilled without asking, so we ended with 3 bottles of (paying) water on the bill. But this was the only thing we did not like, overall it was very good
2
Our evening at Pollen was an enjoyable evening. The service was fine with a staff that was friendly and helpful. The drinks tasty and the appetiser was delicious. The ambiance wasn't quite what I expected, but it was the first time there for us. We were very pleased with the staffs suggestion that we take a moment between courses to visit the Flower Dome. What a beautiful place. The dishes we ordered were well plated and quite delicious. The reason I have given this place a poor rating is because the main I ordered is not what I received. I ordered the Wagyu beef and what I received was a very tough and very lean shoulder cut. It had absolutely no marbling at all. When I order Wagyu I order it for the fat content. I did not send it back as it was late in the day and I was hungry. I did mention it to the staff and was told that it was indeed Wagyu beef. It was not. I have enjoyed Wagyu beef before and what showed up on my plate was something different. So like the title says...all it takes is one lie to ruin a good meal
5
We eat here with a party of 14 made up of people with varied dietary requirements. There was some thing for everyone on the menu and staff were very helpful.
4
Our party of 25 enjoyed our hi tea at Pollen very much. Food was great, especially the savory items. The greatest part was the cool ambience, as we were surrounded by flowers and greens
We would make another trip to Pollen pretty soon!
4
We sat downstairs for dinner and the surroundings were a cool 20oC. We thoroughly enjoyed the food although it would be better to sit upstairs
4
We just wanted a light lunch so we ordered a few entrees and shared. We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our visit. The venue, the quality of the food and service. Worth a visit
4
The restaurant has a very nice design & concept in vogue. It is tastefully located inside the Garden of the Bay & they offer buggy pickup service at the entrance of the Garden, & the restaurant has a private access to the Flower Dome. While they aim to be a fine dining venue with their pricing & menu, it is a pity that their service do not match up. Pollen doesn't seem to have good managers & quality staff , their service have a lot to be desired
2
We ate here while touring the gardens..convenient but that's about all that was good.The food was below average, and the service was so slow it was laughable. It took us 2 hours to eat lunch...thankfully it was raining out or we would have lost it. During that two hours, we only managed to track someone down once to get one extra glass of wine. And to be noted...there was only 2 other tables eating in the small restaurant space
4
We hadn't planned to stop here for anything, but second sister needed a rest, so we decided to have a cup of coffee which then became full high tea and "free flow" coffee. Pollen is tucked away in one corner of the Flower Dome, close to the loos. The tea set was actually quite good, with savoury and sweet items. We also ordered a scone with cream and jam, also tasty. Service was OK, though we were told that we couldn't stay long because the staff had to rearrange the tables etc. for a private function. In the end, we were able to finish everything without undue haste.Not a bad little pit stop after an arduous afternoon looking at flowers.....
5
We went to Pollen(main dining room, not the terrace) based on EatSingapore book, and was for our anniversary. Locating in the flower dome gives diners access to the flower dome during meal which is nice. The amuse-bouche were quite special, creative and tasty. On their recommendation, we got red prawn tartare and foie gras as starter, and they were tasty. Red prawn tartare was quite special, with interesting texture. Our main was good too but not as special as the starter and amuse-bouche. Services was excellent too, though we did have some problem while booking table, they never come back to confirm our table.
4
Stopped in for an afternoon snack/drink whilst wandering through the flower dome (with our young family (8, 5, 3yr olds). The wines by the glass aren't cheap (~$30!), but the wine of the day ($10) was pleasant enough. My wife's cocktail from the specials board was also nice. The kids loved the delicate pastries, although these aren't cheap (but for it's location...)! The afternoon tea set (not available Tuesdays apparently) looked excellent value at $35 (ish) and came with a selection of savoury and sweet items (they'd just sold their last serving when were visited at 3:30pm). You can add a glass of prosecco to this if you like, and for $50 extra there's "free flow" prosecco which sounds like it'd be fun (not for our troop today though!). It's a really pleasant "outdoor" cafe amongst a very healthy herb garden (test the kids!). Free Wifi is a bonus for most travellers without a local SIM card (no point when there's free Wifi everywhere) and this let us FaceTime the family from nearby within the dome which was fun.Apparently if you have a reservation here, you can enter through a separate back entrance and wander the gardens for free afterwards (unverified, but from the waitress)
2
We stopped here for a light snack while we were touring the flower dome. We ordered the olives and Mansego cheese and almonds. There were plenty of olives, but only two small pieces of cheese. They served it with a toothpick to eat the olives and the cheese. I couldn't figure out how to eat the almonds using a toothpick. They used a lot of black peppercorn in preparing the olives. It overpowered the dish. Just about every Olive was stuffed with them and you had to remove them before being able to eat the Olive. One small appetizer and two glasses of wine for about $40
4
The atmosphere is amazing, you can walk around the flower dome afterwards. Their main was okay but their dessert is worth a try.
3
Friendly experienced service staffs but the food was normal to me. Nothing spectacular. Made a reservation at 7.30pm and we arrived 10 minutes earlier and was seated on a table but at 7.30pm I got a call from the restaurant asking me where am I.
5
Beautiful environment for afternoon high tea. Complimentary visit to Flower Dome and buggy ride to and from the vistor centre!
4
The cocktails were pretty interesting. We went on a quiet Monday night so there isn't many people. Food was ok. Environment is nice.
4
Loved Pollen for some things:- it's ambience ! Simply lovely, relaxing, could even get the fragrance of some flowers from the flower dome - the free look around of the flower dome - I think that's a lovely idea to allow the diners to walk around the dome and then sit down to dinner. Sets the scene so to speak.- they had options for vegetarians - yay! Unfortunately we were disappointed with the waiters' inability to speak properly thus not making themselves understood when explaining the dishes! They did try though and it is not really their fault.While the food was not too bad it wasn't that great either for the amount we paid for the paired wine tasting. The wine selections were also not too good. I was particularly disappointed with the cheese selections - some of the cheeses were quite ordinary like the Red Leicester! I was a bit surprised that for the cost they did not carry more exotic or out of the ordinary cheeses. I would recommend the place if you want something special
3
Visited Pollen with the wife on our wedding anniversary and we were very pleased with the service and ambiance of the place. Extra points for the complimentary access to the flower dome, which was offered to us as a pre-meal visit. The price premium is understandable for such an establishment but unfortunately the food was lacking in many ways. The foie gras is not prepared in a traditionally seared manner but rather paté-style and had an unpleasant odour. The Wagyu used a poor choice of cut and grill combination, resulting in the sides being overly charred and unedible. I had to manually extract the center cuts to eat. The duck's meat was very tough and my wife had difficulty chewing. The only save of the meal was the brown crab starter, which was really good. I don't mind paying good money for some atmosphere with food, but the latter definitely has to be above average at the very least
5
I had the lunch menu and I was pleased with how every item ordered was excellent cooked, with lots of balance in the flavours and textures. The complimentary sourdough and multigrain breads were some of the best you can find here, and was truly to die for.The free ticket to the Flower Dome when dining at Pollen is always the perfect 'dessert' to the excellent food here
3
My friend and I spent a great deal of time choosing the perfect place for afternoon tea. We hadn't seen each other in a long time and wanted somewhere special; Pollen seemed to fit the bill. It's a fair distance from the front entrance of the Gardens so there is a buggy to take you to the restaurant, which is lovely. The decor is unusual and it connected to the flower gardens which you can tour for free after your tea.We were presented with two serving boards - one savoury and one sweet. Overall, I was quite impressed by the quality of the food served (although I must admit the boards were looking tired and would have benefited from a good sanding and resealing). Yet we were both hanging out for the highlight - scones and clotted cream! We both have the same philosophy - a mere whisper of jam and loads of cream to make it perfect. I assumed I had misheard when the waitress placed a tiny bowl on cream next to the scones saying "Crème Fraiche" because surely no one would do that to an unsuspecting scone? Well, they did. It was either actually intended to be Crème Fraiche or the regular cream had soured. Either way, "sour" describes our feelings upon realising what had been served to us. I rallied and requested for "real cream" and was presented instead with sweet vanilla mascarpone. We gave up in disappointment and left. In all my years of dining, I have never been served sour cream with scones. Personally, I can't recommend it. So if you're going for afternoon tea, and the highlight of your day has been imagining the scones and cream, I'd recommend going somewhere else. But if that's not your main event, Pollen is worth a visit - just make sure you have time to tour the flower gardens too
4
We were spending time at Gardens by the bay, where inside the flower done, the weather was hot and we found Pollen as a nice little haven for a snack and drink, we only chose a snack rather than a meal as it was hot and we were not that hungry, needed a break and the drink it's a great spot quiet sheltered and uncluttered. Service was a little slow to start with but very friendly and the snake was more than ample in size
3
Enjoyed a delicious dinner with work colleagues on a Friday evening. We had two terrific bottles of white wine and some decent if overly complicated food. The room isn't quite as nice as you think it's going to be given the location. No real views of the gardens or the water. The staff were nice but slightly off for a venue at this price - we shouldn't have to chase for wine top ups repeatedly. The homemade bread was delicious
5
The food is passionate and innovative. Love the red prawn tartare - it has tomato 'ice cream' on it. Also had the good.
5
Great little spot tucked in the corner of the flower dome. I had the pulled pork bagel and it was delicious. The rest of the menu and cabinets looked equally amazing.
5
Worth for money, worth for time, worth for Travelling, definitely will visit again. Highly recommend to everyone:)
2
Stopped at Pollen for a drink and cake - very disappointing. Both were very ordinary, hot chocolate was neither hot, nor very chocolate and the cake was poor. Venue is beautiful and staff are friendly and efficient but the kitchen clearly needs work....
5
Thank you for the little surprise "chocolate surprise for my wife birthday".. Really appreciate that... thank you.. and will come back again
4
I went with friends to Pollen for a late lunch today. We ended up sharing five smaller plates and had the free flow Prosecco at $40 per head for two hours. The food was well presented and very flavoursome and the setting was stunning. The Prosecco deal is worth the money and the service staff kept our glasses topped up for the entire time, without us even having to ask. Definitely worth a visit
4
We hadn't thought about lunch, but enjoying our visit to the gardens by the bay, and in the flower dome the restaurant looked attractive - so enjoyed a delightful salmon dish and a very reasonably priced bottle of sauvignon blanc from their recommended wine list. Although busy, we didn't have long to wait for a table and the staff were very courteous
3
My husband and I were there for their SGD 38++ pp Hi Tea. The food was not bad at all. Pretty good stuff. Decent variety. The scone was yummilicious. Sadly, the presentation of the food was just dull... on some jaded wooden boards. The place was not that comfortable. The sun was shining through and the place was warm. Visitors from the garden were just hanging around where we were seated. A stone-face waitress greeted us. I felt so unwelcome when she made absolutely no attempt to help when I told her I was sensitive to the sun and needed a change of seats. Anyway , we found ourselves seats shaded from the sun by a pillar. This place has the potential to provide an unforgettable dining experience but somehow there's just no oomph :
4
An amazing setting within the Gardens by the Bay an inside the Flower Dome. The cutout is simple but made elegant by the flowers, plants and amazing structures. Staff is helpful and efficient. The menu is more sophisticated than we expected, with good quality options and a good wine list. For location, quality of food and ambiance the cost is acceptable. If you love plants and botanical gardens don't forget to visit the Flower Dome. It is amazing but don't forget to take a jumper. It is cold.....
5
This place was a bit pricy, but the 5 course lunch meal was of the highest quality and the most beautiful presentation. I was not expecting such fine dining and immaculate presentation, but I was pleasantly surprised. The portions are small, but the meal in total is filling. The service is slow and deliberate so a rushed meal will not be had. The main dining room is downstairs from the main entrance of the restaurant from the exhibit. Plan on eating here when you visit Gardens by the Bay.

Located in the Flower Conservatory, this restaurant is ideally place. Very beautiful setting and scenery inside it. Went for the afternoon tea and the tea set was really delicious and good. Service was fast and staff were very attentive to all the customers need.

Wonderful place to take visiting friends and family. Beautiful setting, attentive service and food is better than most "fine dining" restaurants that I've tried in SG. Bonus that you get free entry to Flower Dome after, so it's well worth doing lunch there.

This Restaurant is located inside the Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay. The Food and Service is excellent. All the hotel Staff is courteous and always serve with a smile. The food taste is very good (especially French Fries) but quantity is less. The Food Dishes prices are expensiv

Pollen is in such a beautiful location (inside the flower dome of Gardens by the Bay) that kitchen really wouldn't have to do too much to impress. Quite the opposite is true however at this restaurant. The menu is made with the freshest of ingredients and is so thoughtfully planned and executed though that it proves fierce competition for the stunning surrounds. Every detail right down to the bread is done well.

We were served by Kelvin who was very attentive & understanding. I was also very satisfied with the wine parings he recommended, all 3 were on point. He is an asset to your restaurant. We decided to move from the main dining hall to the terrace for dessert & the staffs gladly obliged.

My husband and I ate here a few weeks ago opting for the dinner taster menu. Beautiful setting and we enjoyed the buggy ride from the entrance. We arrived at 7pm and informed we could visit the Flower Dome after our meal, which closed at 9pm. Unfortunately we had to wait for 30 minutes with only water on the table before we got any food or wine. I would describe the service as indifferent although the food was quite good. My husband had the wine flight which he didnt particularly enjoy - a very strange choice of some fairly obscure wines. We noticed that almost everyone in the restaurant left one particular glass of the wine choices. We didn't actually finish the meal until 10.15 as the service was really slow. I regretted ordering tea at the end as it was delivered to another table and had to wait 15 minutes until it arrived. We didn't get to see the Flower Dome - we could have had a good look round between some of the courses! Disappointing given the high cost of the meal - good food let down by poor service. It is also very very cold so be sure to take a jacket or wrap

My wife and I came to Pollen for an anniversary celebration for lunch and we had a lovely time.The place is inside the Gardens by the Bay and beneath the Flower Dome. It has a romantic ambience with the flower arrangement and natural sunlight beaming in from the outside. We were like having lunch in the Garden of Eden. One suggestion - maybe to bring a top or jacket as the air conditioning can be a bit strong. We had the set lunch menu with the addition of Billecart-Salmon rose champagne. It was lovely. The set menu we had included tomato salad, pork belly, duck carpaccio, and sea bass, though I would expect it to change according to season.We had our desserts and coffee upstairs inside the Flower Dome and we took the opportunity to walk around this amazing indoor garden that brought together plants from all over the world under one roof, and air conditioned.It was a lovely afternoon
4
We went to Pollen during our visit to Gardens on the Bay. It is part of the flower dome, and offers fine dining, or a bistro for more informal dining. We opted for the bistro option.The food was lovely and the service was good. Because this is part of the dome, it was very chilled inside. If you get cold easily, consider planning to take something warm to wear while inside
2
The food quality and standard are disappointing.The combination or theme for the afternoon tea is Local Delights meet The Mediterranean meet The Oriental?Lavender Harmony Tea has no taste and scent of Lavender at all.Services are bad, as guests were been neglacted and when topping up our tea pots with hot water, only one pot was filled full, the other just fill up less than 1/4 and walked away?Even if no more hot water, service staff should informed as a courtesy and then returned again to fill up
4
Great location, good food and free access to the Flower Dome. All positives for the restaurant. Service is friendly and attentive. It can be quite cold inside, though - so, do carry appropriate clothing to be able to fully enjoy the experience. And book in advance ..
5
Very personalised service with good food. Good ambience with pleasant staff.
The New Zealand Turbot dish is a must try.
Slightly chilly as it is inside the flower dome so bring a jacket along.
4
And absolutely the very best chocolate tart EVER! Coffee only so so, but a lovely spot for a break from the busyness of the Flower Dome.
4
Just by walking around the flower dome you might get tired and you will surely feel a craving once you see the POLLEN board. I strongly suggest you visit this cafe at least for a cuppa and have a cake. Both are fantastic, though on the slightly higher side on cost but its worth the time, environment and the taste
4
The Flower Dome keeps a somewhat cool temperature inside the dome so even though outside it is 30 degrees Celsius (about 90 degrees Fahrenheit), you will need a sweater if you remain inside to eat lunch.The Pollen restaurant is a small restaurant serving a limited menu of "French" style lunches. My wife and I ordered a salmon with grilled asparagus and (maybe) a whipped potato that was quite good and a smoked salmon on toast that was also good. For dessert we divided a whole Apple Tartin that was quite good. The chef only makes a few per day and people do not usually order them at lunch. Do so.A Japanese white wine (with impossible name) was on the house wine list at 10 SGP$ ($7 US). It was also on the regular open wine list at twice the price. It was quite good with the fish dishes in the style of a dry sauvignon blanc.Lunch including a large Pelligrino, and Cappuchinos, VAT and service was SGP$ 156(about $115 US). Worth it
5
We managed to obtain an online booking for pollen a week in advance. The restaurant was able to meet our dietary requests - 2 "Normal", 1 vegetarian and one who can only eat supper small portions - wait staff assisted with identifying the perfect combination of set and ala cart options. Food was explained when it arrived and was beautifully presented. Each plate bought a new taste sensation that was thoroughly enjoyable. We look forward to sharing the experience with extended family on the next visit. It was a joy to sit amongst the garden and enjoy such beautiful food
4
We had a really nice lunch at pollen. The restaurant is cool (in temperature - such a beautiful garden feel!) and has a lovely French country chic feel. We had a vegan set degustation menu made for us - delicate flavours and very thoughtfully put together. Stand out was asaparagus
5
Went there yesterday and here is my view:Food: Excellent. The seafood is of great quality and I really enjoyed te brown Scottish crab. The red prawns were also very good. Price. We paid about $230 for 2. That firstly looked very expensive but that is the same range in Europe.Service. Not bad. I can see that service is trying hard. Quite knowledgeable. I bit disappointed that I felt they had a commercial approach trying to have us ordering more. (Maybe I am wrong). At the end we complained that we were proposed some Spanish ham that cost 50$ for 5 very thin slices. They were discounted to 20$ so I appreciate the service quick reaction. Otherwise this would have not been a 5* rating.Location: good and quit

Friendly experienced staff, a la carte menu varied and dishes were delicious and beautifully presented, dishes complemented by lots of small extras and servings were generous. Wine list is extensive and varied but very pricey, partly that's alcohol prices in Singapore. As others have commented, and the restaurant advises, it is cold, come dressed with several layers, I would estimate temp was about 16-18C in the evening we were there, they don't have much control as restaurant is inside Flower Dome. Happy with our choice for our anniversar
4
My husband and I prebooked for this lunch to celebrate our 21st anniversary. We got there by MRT so we didn't the buggy ride to the restaurant. The restaurant was cold inside due to the temp of the flower dome but we had 2 little blow heaters at our feet to keep us nice and comfy. what a great idea. We went for the 5 course meal and we weren't disappointed. By the end even with the little beautifully crafted morsels we truly had an elegant sufficiency. I had a glass of Italian bubbles and my hubby a glass of French red. Both complemented our meals perfectly. The service was impeccable. Defo worthwhile to have a meal here to celebrate something and later go for a nice walk in the Flower Dome which is included in the price of the meals
4
Excellent afternoon tea set in a unique setting. The triangular scones were a pleasant surprise and the clotted cream was a commendable effort. The service could have been a little better in my opinion. But the overall experience was very good. The fact that the held the table to wait for us who were over an hour late was very nice of them
5
fourth year anniv with the hubby over lunch - 3 course menu included a buggy service, additional soup and petit fours, loaned shawl, and entrance to flower dome at 55++ at a fine dining resto! not bad at all
4
Good food and service but could have offered a fewer course vegetarian option in lunch. Food can also be served faster
5
This is my second visit on Pollen and I am satisfied once more with the gastronomy by the kitchen team that always combine certain plant-based ingredients with the food.
4
My family and I had a lovely experience at Pollen. The ambience was fantastic. We ordered the set lunches which was a tad pricey but the extras that they provided made it very worthwhile. Food was pretty good, although a little on the salty side.. It was a pretty cold in the restaurant as it was raining outside but the staff were very kind to offer shawls to keep us warm.. really good service! Eating at Pollen also allowed complementary access to the Flower Dome which was fantastic! Would definitely come back again
5
My partner invited me there to celebrate my birthday. The food and the service were excellent. We both had the tasting menu which will make you discover surprising flavors and texture inspired by both Asian and Western cuisines. Excellent wine list and cocktails as well.If you finish early, you get also free access to the cloud forest which is pretty stunning with Baobab and Cherry blossom trees living together
5
The view is beautiful & the ambience is quiet & romantic. The staff told us that we're able to explore the flowers exhibition at Gardens By The Bay for free. The food is yummy at full dining restaurant at the lower floor. There are two different levels and have different dining menu. The service is excellent. The price is a bit steep. That's why I gave four stars. But we will go back there again because of the food, the service, the view & the ambience:):):
5
Pollen is in the 'Gardens by the Bay' flower dome, in a lovely location. You can be picked up by their buggy (near the entrance) if you ask. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Food is consistently well made and the mocktails are delicious. Bring a sweater, because it is a little cold due to the flowers
2
Hadnt been to Pollen for over a year or two. So decided to go there but only a few tables were occupied. When i last went it was packed out. They strongly encourage you to have the degustation menu. I did wine pairing also. SGD88+ for 4 glasses of wine per person. I thought it strange they would offer a japanese wine, south african shiraz some sweet orange infused wine. I am luckily not a wine aficionado but one would be disappointed if they were. Food was nothing that fantastic. They make it look good but the flavour and combination on the plate doesnt really work. The salmon dish however was very nice (and i am not a salmon eater) but everything else lacked a wow factor. Dessert they pushed us to have an apple dessert instead of what was on degustation as i presume it is premade and no one had ordered it for the evening. it was nice though. will i go back...quite surely i wont as it lacked atmoshpere and was freezing cold inside. There are many other dining options there. I wanted to take the golf buggy to car park but the waitress seem to encourage us to walk..
3
This review is the cafe like terrace. It's situated inside the flower down at Gardens by the bay so one expects a slightly more expensive price tag given it's tourist prices. But I expected better food. Had the pulled pork bagel. Was too salty. Same with the calamari. Was meant to be a nice quick lunch after a morning at the dome. I couldn't finish the bagel. Given this experience I'm not inclined to go to the main dining room.Afraid I won't be going back
4
Stopped off here for some lunch after going to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Was a nice place. Friendly service. Food was good and they had some nice cocktails. A little overpriced, but overall, a nice meal and experience. Give it a go if you're there
5
food was great, though dessert was a little too quirky. loved the ambience, and the staff were friendly and prompt with their service as well.
4
Enjoying most of the courses even though lacking that spot on feeling. Very nice staff - but timing, execution etc. is far from where this restaurant should be aiming.
2
We went in here for a coffee and snack, when we tried to order we were told 'only drinks' so just had the coffee, to our surprise people at the table next to us has food taken to them and 2 tables who arrived after us also got food. We had to go up to counter to pay as nobody came to our table, when I complained about not being able to have food got the response 'we do not do food between 17.00 & 18.00 on stating others had was just met no answer, then to see the bill which was high for 2 small drinks had a 10% service charge!!! Which adds insult as service they do not do..
2
The place is well located but extremely cold due to the connection to the interior garden. The service is very slow. The wine pairings are adventurous and rather unfortunate. The cuisine is good but extremely disappointing in terms of portion (i understand nouvelle cuisine but this is a ripoff). Sommelier is nice & welcome staff & buggy service too but the waitering is miserable & almost rude. It is nice for tourists who will never come back
5
We were a group of 3 and ordered a tasting menu and two main courses of the vegetarian menu. The tasting menu would have been enough for all three of us. This was some of the best food I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The ambiance is quiet and chilly, the service was delightfully attentive without hovering, and every bite of food was amazing. I also appreciated the shawls they gave us to keep us warm. This was an expensive treat for all of us and even the non-vegetarian enjoyed every single morsel. Well worth the price and the time to enjoy every single bite
1
...you do not expect the kitchen to be closed when you arrive at 21.46. It would seem logical to wait at least 15 min after the last table time to close the kitchen, especially after us having called and warned you that we probably will be a bit late. Disappointing
3
The food was good, I liked the interessting combinations and the way it was presented on the plate. Also the service was good, very attentive.But it was very cold in the restaurant, by far too cold to really enjoy the good food, so we rushed to finish and left much earlier than expected, very unpleasant
4
Firstly, really appreciated the buggy service (they responded very quickly when we called and asked when the buggy was coming to the Arrival Plaza), though the walk there really isn't that long.Atmosphere was splendid, being surrounded by flowers and plants. There was sufficient space between tables as well such that our conversations could be private enough. Food was excellent -- including the starters and dessert that were included in the meal. Will definitely visit again :)
4
The hi tea set was value for money. This comes with complimentary buggy ride to the restaurant's door and complimentary access to the garden dome. The hi tea set cost $38 but there was an incredible offer going on, top up $7 for two glasses of ice wine which taste really good.The food was nice and it's really good ambience, eating while surrounded by flowers and being able to conveniently access the garden dome right after finishing the mea
5
When we think of Garden by the Bay we would think of Pollen. Whenever we walked pass the restaurant we always wonder how it is inside. Now we know. Given local always hot weather, it is a pleasant experience dining inside Pollen. The cooling environment with surrounding flowering plants is an experience I don't think can be found anyway locally. Coupled with excellent service, it brings the afternoon tea experience to another level. I really liked their savoury and dessert dishes. The skills and creativity put into making of the dishes can be felt. The way it is presented demonstrates the effort put into making the dishes appealing and interesting. I like the hummus in particular paired with the dried bread roasted to the crispness of almond cake. As part of the promotion, we are given white and red ice wine to try. This is the first time I have wine paired with afternoon tea. A wonderful experience in whole. I would encourage whoever read the review to try their afternoon tea and dinner. I believe it will be a unforgettable experience.
3
It was great experience to have afternoon tea in Pollen. Environment is good. It would be great if could have buggy service for guest to travel from Bayfront MRT to the venue.
5
The whole staff made sure all dietary needs and concerns were addressed. They made us a special diary free chocolate as one guest does not take dairy! Amazing!
4
Enjoy good food in a cosy ambience in the midst of a garden setting! The family enjoys it very much!
4
Food is of excellent quality and beautifully presented. This is definitely a quality over quantity establishment so don`t expect large portions. Because it is exposed to the temperature of the Flower Dome it can feel quite cold.
5
Just had a very lovely lunch here whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. Succulent salmon followed by Macadamia Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Icecream a refresh side and green tea. Feeling refreshed and pleasantly satiated.
5
Had a wonderful evening with my family and elderly mother at Pollen. Started with a lovely hour spent at the Flower Dome (when I made the reservation, Valerie was helpful to mention it's free entry for Pollen guests). Plan your trip early around 5-6pm so that you'll get there when there's still natural daylight to better appreciate the blooms. So delighted to see and smell cherry blossoms in Spore!Dinner was most delicious. We ordered the salted egg and sweet potato with goes so well with the multigrain bread, halibut, the "tomahawk" steak, and white chocolate and honey ice-cream. Service is attentive even though the restaurant was packed on a week night. The evening came to a perfect end with the buggy ride back to the underground carpark. Was such a treat for everyone of us!Note: If you're walking to Pollen from Bayfront MRT, take exit B and head for the waterfront, and you can't go wrong. You'll see Marina Bay Sands on your left and the super trees on your right. After 10 minutes, the path will curve to the right where you'll see the Pollen signboard. There are no signs to the restaurant along the way. Don't follow the "More dining" / "Flower Dome" brown sign because that's the opposite direction!
5
The pleasant services starts from the buggy service pick up from the information counter of Gardens By The Bay (GBTB) to the restaurant. Once we reached, a service staff waited for us with a brolly as the weather was muggy and has started to pour. Service was attentive throughout and they even offered shawls as the AC can be quite cold. The plating of the dishes are all instagram worthy for those into social media. The food are fusion-ish and taste great. The lunch set was S$55++ (3 course) and S$85 (5 course) which are quite value for money. Eating at Pollen also included entry into the flower dome of GTBT which really made the meal all the more value for money
5
We were touring the gardens and decided to stop off here for lunch. We had failed to appreciate that it was very much a full service, upmarket, foodie restaurant, which wasn't quite what we were looking for at the time. However, getting over our surprise, we found a couple of dishes we liked the look of on the a la carte menu and enjoyed the full five star treatment with amuse bouches, beautiful breads and spreads and a glass of wine.Despite it's location in the gardens, this is a fabulous, high quality restaurant, equal to the best around the world. It's just not a place you stumble into for a quick, cheap lunch
5
I highly recommend the tasting menu at this top end restaurant in Singapore. The staff were very helpful and attentive, and the food was divine. Highlights included the foie gras, beef cheek, and pumpkin ice cream with white chocolate. Every course was beautifully presented and there was a nice wine list. The flavours just burst off the plate, and there were some surprising combinations which worked very well, such as the beetroot sorbet with valrhona chocolate dessert. It can be very expensive to eat here, but you do get what you pay for (in my opinion). Highly recommended.Note the best way to get here is using the free buggy from the taxi drop-off point for the Gardens in the Bay. Complimentary access to the flower dome is included, though in the evening it's a bit too dark to see very much. After dinner it's a 5-10 min walk through to the super-tree forest where there is a light show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. It makes a very nice evening
4
Peaceful with a very high touch of class, yet with a small feel of simplicity, paired with great view, Pollen is the definite place to be for a great meal at the Gardens By The Bay. Service standards is high and second to none at the GBTB
4
Delicious wonderful deserts. Main beef dish is not recommended.
It is too cold. Long sleeves are necessary. Good view of Singapore flyer in level 1.
2
Had lunch here while visiting the garden. They first got the order wrong and then the food was poor. Definitely overpriced for the quality. The drinks were from a bottle.
5
The staff was friendly and they paced the food well. Wonderful ambience for a conversation.
The food was great.
5
World class dining experience. I'm vegan and they created an entirely set menu to cater for my dietary requirements. The staff were flawless and the food was impeccable.
1
Slow service
Service staff who are oblivious to you
Small food portions
Average food for the price
Only saving grace is the location
2
An attractive venue in the Flower Dome at the Gardens by the Bay with an interesting but very expensive menu (tea and a slice of cake $28!) and the service is very slow. Only recommended if you are desperate.
4
Had afternoon tea at Pollen. Buggy service pick up at arrival plaza which is good experience. The place is beautiful and get to walk around the dome for free. The savory food on the tea menu is awesome but the sweet was ok. The restaurant was crowded and service was slow. The refill of hot water to the tea took about an hour. Area is small so table is small. 4 persons having the same table size as 2 pax.
5
Going to Marina Bay Gardens is a wonderful experience but to have it enhanced by amazing food and wine is very special. The restaurant organise a pick up in a golf buggy at the entrance to the park, plus you get free access to the flower dome which is a bonus. The food was really beautiful with complex layers of tastes and surprises. I chose off the set lunch menu which was good value plus I took the advice of the excellent somelier. All in all great service too. I was downstairs and the only disadvantage of where I was sitting is that it was very cold so take a jumper
3
Entrance to Pollen is half way around the Garden By The Bay Complex. Nice walk if you have time and if it is not too hot. Otherwise, wait for the little trolley. As location is under the big umbrella glass roof, air-conditioning cannot be controlled and it tends to be extremely cold in the restaurant. Although they provide shawls I recommend you bring a jacket. Food was fine if not out of this world and service was attentive. However, the overall atmosphere is not festive for which you cannot blame the restaurant. If you are there in the Gardens at dinner time fine. To go there from center of town is not worth it as there are better and more stylish restaurants downtown
5
One of the best lunches I've had - everything was fantastic, from the food, to the service, and it even came with a free pass to the Flower Dome (wow!).The lunch set came with a free serving of some of the best sourdough bread I've had and, ooh, that smoked butter. The butter with that rich smoky flavour with bits of sesame and salt, freshly made in-house as I was told. That butter is going to ruin every butter I am going to have. It also came with a tiny jar of cumin-spiced hummus, which was amazing as well. And that was just the start of what was to be an excellent meal I still couldn't forget over the weekend.The venison carpaccio, served with slices of foie gras and beetroot was an exciting mix of rich flavours and textures. The Dover sole was soft and juicy, and lovely with the orange. It was served with kale chips which I like very much. The dessert was an interesting and delicious beetroot sorbet on a dark chocolate ganache on a pistachio base, which I enjoyed as well.Do look out for the exciting amuse bouche and the post-meal truffles as well.I can't wait to return to Pollen to try out more of their menu
5
The ambience of the store, i love. Every food was served nicely. Service was great! I will definitely recommend this store to couples because it is a nice place for a date.
5
The staff were very attentive. We ordered the tomahawk steak which took 30 mins but in general, they provide free access to the flower dome.
5
We had dinner at Pollen on Chinese New Years and it was wonderful. We opted for the a la carte menu rather than the prix fixe. The scallops were some of the best I have ever tasted and the duck was delicious.
5
Jason Atherton already has several trendy restaurants in Singapore. But Pollen, situated in a botanical garden under the roof, a cut above the rest. Especially good rustic duck with foie gras and black currant.
3
Went for the afternoon tea for my sister's bridal shower. Portions were a bit small, and we ordered mains because we weren't full. The staff were lovely tho, and very helpful. The atmosphere in the flower dome is beautiful as well!
4
Went to Pollen in the Flower Dome for my wife's birthday with friends. The place isn't quiet as cosy as I had thought it might be...it's even a little austere and "modern cafe" like. The most obvious thing about the experience however is the temperature.....it's absolutely freezing!!! They even hand out pashminas, so it's obviously a problem...unfortunately they'd handed them all out by the time we arrived so we had to wait until some became available. By that stage they were giving us glasses of hot water to keep our hands warm!!Anyway, you arrive at the Super Trees and are met by a golf buggy driver who drives you right to the restaurant...very nice! The service is excellent and the food is delicious. Apart from the basic decore and intensely frigid temperatures, it was a lovely evening but not my first choice for the next expensive night out
1
For the prices at this restaurant, we were extremely disapponted and will never go back. The fish we ordered was not fresh, dry and overall just awful. The sides we ordered never came, the atmosphere was quite sterile and the staff weren't particularly friendly. There are so many other restaurants that I wooos prefer to go to that are half the cost of Pollen!
1
Booking made for 8 without deposit and we must order 8 tea sets which have a lot of food we barely can finish half. I see other table customers can just order drinks, suggest not to make reservation and just walk in.Macaron is my favourite dessert, but Pollen Macaron is way too sweet which I just have one bite and put down
3
This is potentially a wonderful place to see the whole world go by but the fine location is wasted by indifferent service and only slightly above average food. The botanical garden next door is a welcome bonus. We honestly hope that this place reaches its potential to be a superb place to dine
3
Other than the great ambiance, nothing to brag about really. Food was fine, service was not genuine. Would appreciate at least a smile from the staff, which I eventually did only when they received the payment. How friendly. Felt like I was in the freezer the entire time . Overall with the money spent, just not worth it
4
Atmosphere and waiters are definitely great. However, when the waiter was asked on what sauces I was served, he needed to check.
5
Great ambience...excellent combination of flavours...lityle on expensive side but great for special occasions
4
Stopped in for a coffee and cake, coffee was really good and enjoyable in the cool climate of the dome. Service was attentive but you do pay for it.
5
The fact that we choose this restaurant to celebrate our last day of 2016 says it all. One word exquisite. Try Nicky's cocktails they are really something
3
We went to this restaurant expecting a high end dining experience, but we were disappointed. We had to send 2 of the 4 meals back because they were not as ordered. The waiter did not come back to our table. When we did manage to flag him down to ask for something it took forever to get it. I thought maybe the kitchen was in the lower level restaurant. The food was very good once we got it. We asked for dessert menus, but he didn't come back to take our order. We enjoyed the fact that the restaurant was in the Flower Dome and we strolled though the gardens after dinner
4
We popped into Pollen for an evening meal and a drink on Sunday night. The venue was a little quiet and we were moved from a table that was never taken up by the time we left.Perhaps we are ugly because they moved us behind a column.We ordered a light plate of sour dough with hummus and smoked butter. It was ok. As an after thought I realise the western restaurants this place attempts to emulate typically provide bread as an appetiser. Not yet normal in Singapore.We ordered the risotto with beef cheeks and the ribeye steak. The plates appear of a conservative size but were filling. The beef was well cooked and if I were to go again I'd order all of it again.The restaurant has daily offers but they are subject to demand and both the desserts of the day were gone by the time it came to us at 7pm.The only thing that was a bit bizarre was the service. We ordered water that didn't come until the third time of asking and plates were cleared before everyone on the table had finished eating.Table water is also expensive at 5sgd per person (possibly by cup- we didn't confirm that)
4
My date and I had a wonderful time at Pollen. We visited on the 4th January 2017. The food was good. We order Foie Gras, Brown Crab, Scallops, and Goat Cheese Creme Brulee. All are good, except that the Steak was a little overcooked and slightly burnt on the outside. We are able to take a walk in the flower dome before dinner. The experience was good. But the price is slightly on the high side. Total bill came up to be over $400. But it was all worth it
3
We were happy to try this restaurant in this stunning location, the flower dome of gardens by the bay... free pick up and free complimentary access to the flower dome were the good points of this restaurant. The rest is really less attractive. Food is ok, but you can find better in Singapore and at a more reasonable price. Overrated... The worst thing of our experience is the coldness, it was freezing on the restaurant and this has really spoil our evening. Will definitely not come back
4
My husband and I were there for anniversary dinner and ordered the 5-course early dinner set (last order i think for this is 7.30pm). Pollen provides excellent services: free buggy pickup point, complimentary entry to flower dome, heater available and even shawl! I was cold but after simply asking they done their best. Special thanks to Jensen for his attentiveness and warmth service. Also to the lady manager (didn't get to know her name). Food was yummy. One room of improvement is since they are called Pollen and located inside flower dome, one of their dishes could possibly be associated to flora
1
Firstly, the service was slow. The bartenders were busy chatting up some chick. Secondly the wine pour was way below standard 150ml. Was 100at best. I asked the waiter to reassess, as there was no clear pour line... and he poured a drop more in to total what may have been 110ml @20-24 per glass this is a disappointment. Our snack (olives, almonds, manchego) was also petite for the price tag. No wonder pollen was not busy
5
The restaurant staff are knowledgeable and have been prepared with the needs of each guest. They make every effort to accommodate the dietary needs of each guest.
5
Food was good and served in bigger portions than thought. The view was not that spectacular though, however the buggy service from the main plaza and the hospitality of the employees were enough to compensate for that.
4
The food was excellent!! We enjoyed a lot. BUT temperature in the restaurant was quite low. Any reason?
5
Enjoy your dining surround with the beauty of mother earth. Food is fantastic and you get complimentary access to the flower dome which makes the deal even value for money!
4
It was a wonderful finish of Garden excursion to try one of the best restaurants in Singapore!All food decisions were quite simple, but bright! Specially wanted to mention the hostess and staff - all very professional.But the portions were so small!!! It's a restaurant, it must be about food, not about amount of staff, not of pretty design and comfortable bus to meet at entrance: first and main is food! I really hardly could make two bites- so small was crab salad. With all my respect to Michelin stars, I went back to city a bit hungry

The location is perfect for visiting gardens by the bay. The restaurant is actually part of the dome. The ambiance is lovely, with flowers around and harbor view from within the dome. The waitress is quite sweet and attentive. To our surprise, the food are not bad at all, unlike what we would expect from a restaurant at the center of a tourism hot spot. The octopus leg is very succulent and rich in flavor. The downside is the service is somewhat slow, we had to wait for quite a while between each course. And the whole place is freezing old, we had to ask for a heater and double blanket

Everything about POLLEN is exceptional. The service, food, decor, location. The gardens are sublime and our lunch at POLLEN was the cherry on the cake. Dining allows you entrance into one of the flower domes free of charge and they picked us up in a little buggy from the main dvtrance area, which was a nice touch too. I can't recommend this place enough. Yhe lunch menu was a fabulous deal too ;

My wife & I went to Pollen for dinner. We were met at the pick up point by a polite buggy driver. The ride was a short 10 minutes to the door of the restaurant. We had an excellent dinner in the cold of the restaurant but was warmed by a portable heater placed beneath the table. Great service too
1
At the price Pollen charge for drinks it is reasonable to expect a decent coffee, not a mixed up order, lukewarm serving of brown milk. At S$40 for 4 small coffees it was closer to theft than service. Do what we should have done and send it back
5
This was my second time at Pollen, first time for dinner. We ordered two 5-course Christmas sets and two a la carte (French Duck and Ribeye). The service staff was great in accommodating sharing portions and my parents who usually are not fans of Western cuisine were pleasantly satisfied. 5-stars!
3
We ordered the afternoon tea for S$38++. Unlimited tea and coffee. A set of sweets and entrees.
It wasn't actually good just ok. Nothing special, though you get free entrance to the flower dome.
4
The service is impeccable. The food average for the price paid. And it was hard to enjoy a meal there due to the freezing temperature, even though a shawl was offered.
5
It was perfect, the food was nice, the staff and the hostess really friendly. Highly recommended for afternoon tea!
4
The food and service was good. We were greeted warmly at the door but it was a little difficult trying to get the servers' attention during the course of the meal. I would like to praise the buggy driver tho. We were there for dinner on xmas eve and it was raining heavily when we arrived and the buggy was wet with puddles of water on the seats. The cloth he had was alr soaking wet so the driver took off his jacket to clean the seats for us. Was surprised to see him do that and really appreciated that
5
We visited Pollen on a weekday at around 2:30pm. We ordered to set menu course, which was absolutely delicious. The servings were indeed quite small, being an up-market, fancy restaurant. However we were very satisfied with the meal overall. We ordered the special drink for the afternoon - mulled wine which was perfect. Service was excellent, 5-star, super attentive and delicate. Highly recommended for a special evening for couples, or even a larger group e.g family for a celebratory evening
3
Girlfriend and I went for the Christmas day menu special. I had the roasted turkey and girlfriend went for the stockyard tenderloin beef. Food and service is good but it takes forever for the food to arrive.It is also cold so I do recommend that you'll bring a jacket along
3
Very very cold inside ! Please remember to bring yourself a thick jacket. Food was so-so, service was extremely slow, expensive price. We took the set meal and desert was either ice cream or cheese and it felt like eating ice cream during winter outdoors.  Only good thing was that we could enjoy the Christmas decorations inside the flower dome. 
2
Went for lunch with family & 4 kids (age 2-7). No kids menu & staff said they could fix up a plain pasta with either tomato or cream sauce ($20) otherwise choose Fish&Chips ($35) from menu. No melamine crockery for kids too, only gave us side plates on request! The stokke highchair was too cramp for my 2.5yo son & his foot got caught between the seat and leg rest, "ikea highchair" was available but staff didn't bother to offer. Basically, the staff don't bother about doing extra. We had to even request for syrup (to sweeten iced tea) & ketchup (for the kids' fish&chips)
1
Visited Pollen to enjoy some morning tea and was informed that there was no food available, only muffins with tea or coffee (it was almost noon). Ordered 2 muffins and 1 bottle sparkling water which was nice, but cost us $30SGD?! Absolutely ridiculous. Waiter was pretentious and obviously had better things to than be at work. Would not recommend!
3
1. Customer service needs attention! I have requested more bread 3 times before I finally got it! Not good!3. Great atmosphere, but too cold! I saw customers living due to the uncomfortable environment! Some ladies on my side did not even want dessert! They were complaining about the cold environment!3. Please be more generous in your food!4. Excellent beets risott
4
Great ambience and cozy place with girlfriends. They served tasty and nice to look at pastries for afternoon tea.
4
The bar area upstairs is excellent. Enjoyed the food but a bit eclectic. Good setting for work outings.
5
We were in need of a cup of tea, having walked the gardens in scorching heat, but when we saw the menu we ordered the afternoon tea, with cava. Absolutely delicious.
3
Visited Pollen to celebrate my fiancée's birthday. Food was good but not sublime, service seemed a little haphazard - service staff did not clear dishes after each course, desserts was forgotten and staff couldn't explain the cheese selection well.
5
Flawless. In a word. A lovely bubbles by the glass, Anna. Delicious starters. Foie gras and a crab bisque. Delightful mains, duck and a pumpkin gnocchi. Intriguing dessert, more pumpkin but delicate with yoghurt and blueberries. Impressive wine list. Impressive location. Delightful service. We had lunch. Dinner would be equally pleasant to be sure, in this restaurant in a garden. Fine dining with options of set menus or a la carte, means plenty of choice.
5
Everyone from the buggy driver to the door hostess to the waiters were all extremely friendly. I brought along my 9 month old baby for the afternoon tea and I was super impressed with the Stokke baby chair that they brought over for us. We needed to change her diaper and since there were no baby changing rooms in the flower dome, one of the waiters gave us some cushions to lay over a nearby stone bench so we could change her there. Being in the flower dome, the restaurant was really cold so bring along a sweater
4
We visited Pollen for lunch on our last day in Singapore having worked for a week there at an international Art Fair. Our last day was spent relaxing in the Gardens By the Bay and a delicious lunch at this delightful restaurant. We took the set lunchtime menu that had plenty of choice. Each dish was beautifully presented and each mouthful a delight. Chef turned out to be a Brit from Milton Keynes. He was a master of his craft. Only criticism was "a glass" of wine was a little puddle at the bottom of the glass!
5
The food really is great, we enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu and each course was creative enough for mention, superbly cooked, and a delight on the palette. The gardens are a favourite of mine, and enjoying a stroll through them before hand adds to the spectacle. If there is one complaint, or perhaps just let down, its that the restaurant itself is quite sombre compared to the Flower Dome in which it lives.Worth a visit, a superb meal and night ou
1
My friend and I visited for a drink as we walked around the Gardens by the Bay and were flat-out horrified as we sat there watching the Manager reduce a staff member to tears behind the bar. We were interrogated about what we might want to order before were seated, as if this determined where would be placed. Then the Manager completely ignored us after we only ordered a(n overpriced beer) each. He was obviously too busy trying to think of more horrible things to say to his waiter. All such a shame as it's in an incredible position and not at all delivering on its magical setting. I sincerely hope that since March that jerk is no longer there and his poor staff are better looked after
3
We arrived Singapore at 1pm. As introduced by the hotel, we reserved a table for afternoon tea at Pollen at 3pm. When we got to the cafe, we noted that we could not order a la carte because they had prepared the tea set for us. May be there was some misunderstanding when we called to reserve the table. The service was acceptable but the food was really bad taste, the texture was not good too, we only finished the 4 pieces of sandwich and wasted all the others
5
Wonderful atmosphere, delicious food, good selection of wines and cocktails. We highly recommend the steaks and desserts.

Visiting singapore over the week end
Got invited at pollen for dinner
The place is lovely inside the garden dome
Great high end food lovely place quite amazing staff
1
Everything about this experience was just AWFUL..from the overpriced so called 'High Tea' to the extremely bad service!! Very disappointed!! Do not waste your time or money!
4
Very pleasantly surprised by Jason Atherton talent and menu choice. Enjoyed the Iberico Pork shoulder lunch and Sea Base fillet. Tasty with surprising taste. Really enjoyable.
5
Great atmosphere, amazing food, wonderful service. Prices quite high, but we knew that before coming.
4
Pollen allows you to pick and choose what you want for each course. There are natural fruit drinks, crab specialities, several places to order satay, and even Mexican food. Open seating to view the surrounding area. Not fancy , just tables and chairs scattered around in the are
1
We were standing at entrance waiting to be seated for long time . Your staff saw us but he just walk away and keep us waiting . In the end he asked another staff inform us if we can take seat at bar because all table are full at the moment or under reservation. It's make sense if you talk to your customer at beginning instead of let them wait and doing nothing .Even just a smile or eye contact to show your respect.People will understand. Its very upset experience
4
We went to the Flower Dome to look at the African tree exhibition and decided to have dinner at Pollen which was conveniently located within the premise. Given air-conditioning of the dome, the restaurant was cold, but the staff were well prepared with a shoal to keep you warm. Food was of good quality, especially the Iberico ham which was one of the best I've tried so far. Having been to several restaurants, this would be on the pricy side and not as good value in other places of similar price range. In all, I was impressed by their thoughtfulness, service level and quality of food. You won't be disappointed to try it once, and since you're there, the dome is just there for a visit
4
I've heard a lot of good things about Pollen but haven't had the chance to try it until my partner's mum was in town and we toured her around Gardens by the Bay. She's an old lady and needed a break from all the walking so we ended up at POLLEN. We thought we'd just have a cup of coffee and a muffin, but we everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing, that we ended up ordering lunch. It was a very good decision! My partner's mum had the avocado toast on multigrain sourdough, my partner had the chilli con carne and I had the puttanesca. All of our choices were spot on. The avocado toast came in a slice of bread (multigrain sourdough), with chunks of avocado and fresh tomatoes on top. My partner's mum loved it. The chili con carne came in a small bowl along with two tortilla bread and some salsa. My partner is pretty finicky about food, but he loved what he ordered. Had a taste of it and the chilli con carne was sweet, smoky with just the right amount of spice. The puttanesca was pretty good too, and was one of the better versions I've had. I love tomato-based pastas and this was hit the spot for me. All in all, it was a pretty stellar meal, considering we didn't plan to eat there. Oh, and the cappuccino was good too. Partner's mum ordered it, after the resto ran out of the tomato juice she wanted. The only downside to an otherwise perfect meal? The service was a bit slower than I would like. It took more than 10 minutes for the wait staff to get to us when we were seated. We had to get their attention a few times before someone came to attend to us. And the food took longer than 15 minutes. Also, when it came time to get the check, we had to ask three times before they managed to give the bill to us. This is a minor quibble though, because all in all, the restaurant experience was really great. Will definitely come by again
4
surrounded with beautiful flowers at the flower dome and it's easy to get there by the free buggy service ride from the main entrance. there is a lack of service staff though as we had to walk up to the staff to get our re-fill of tea pot. generally service is ok.
4
We were very lucky to get to dine here.
The food was wonderful.
It is not cheap & drinks are also pricey.
But well worth the cost.
It is cold in here due to being attached to the orchid house.
So wear warm clothes.
5
Service was great. Everything was very smooth. Staff are friendly and accommodating. As I am not able to take tea and coffee, I requested for hot honey lemon instead and were able to change the drinks for me. Great service! Good food as well.
4
Wonderful place for meal if you have overseas guests to impress. Our guests love the food, wine and service. And they were impressed and delighted with the free stroll in the flower dome.
5
Unique location, dining among plants but still in cool air conditioning. Being outdoors indoors has never been so awesome!
4
Went for their Mediterranean afternoon tea, those foods are average, i mean for the savouries part, for the sweets part, overall is ok. Love their environment so much. Might get back for their lunch or dinner.
3
Love the ambient but a bit hot for hightea due to not under the shade. The service level is not up to my standard for this kind of fine dining restaurant. Their petite cakes is good.
5
We really fancied high tea on the day we visited and so were pleased to find this place inside the gardens. Having eaten at Pollen Street Social only a few weeks before, we were excited to coincidentally find a sister restaurant.The high tea was served from 2:30 and was very busy - we seemed lucky to get a table, which we booked an hour in advance.Whilst different to a traditional English afternoon tea (no scones) this was absolutely delicious! And although it looked small, it filled us up between a large breakfast and small post-drinks dinner. I had the rose tea which I loved. The sandwiches were served as canapÃ© type toast and topping and the cakes included brownie, macaron and choux bun among others. The afternoon tea included free access into the conservatory which made it highly worthwhile.Note that it's very cold in here - although if you ask, they do give out shalls for this reason. Would definitely recommend
4
It is literally inside The Garden and that makes it unique. It is small and romantic I guess. Food is jus fine and I expected it to be a bit overpriced bec. of it's location. It's nice to experience dining inside the Garden even for once
4
A little surprise lunch from my boyfriend who made a reservation at this place after hearing his client rave about it. Finding a parking spot was easy and as we made our way up the escalator, we saw the Pollen buggy at the entrance waiting for us even though we were around 10 mins late. Buggy took us right to the entrance of the restaurant with a little scenic ride across Gardens by the bay. We went with the 3 course set meal at $55++, I thought it was very reasonably priced with the stunning view and fine dining experience we've got. We were served little pork puff sides with hummus and fresh multi grain bread and sourdough white bread with their homemade roasted butter to start, it was refreshing to have something different other than the usual bread, balsamic, olive oil combination.We were served our 1st course shortly and we both ordered the beef carpacio served with kimchi and sour cream, I was a little worried on how this fusion dish would taste and it turns out amazingly tasty. Beef slices are fresh, kimchi taste is not overwheming and the sour cream blends in well with every bite I took. For our mains, we ordered the beetroot risotto with ricotta cheese and the panseared monkfish. There's nothing extraordinary with the monkfish dish, but with the beetroot risotto, I would highly recommend it! I'm a big fan of risotto and have tried all type of flavor but never tried beetroot. I personally do not like the strong taste of beetroot and it usually just drown the taste of other ingredient but the waitress assure me that the beetroot taste is very subtle. I love it! The ricotta cheese makes it a little creamy and the small chunks of beetroot and cereals adds a crunch to the risotto.Lastly for our dessert, we ordered the ganache with poached pears and chocolate ice cream and also honey pudding with roasted quinoa ice cream. The poached pear adds a little refreshing fruity sweetness to it and we loved the roasted quinoa ice cream with a nice sweet crunch to it. Service is amazing, they constantly checked and make sure that our waters are refilled and making sure the food is to our satisfactory.After lunch, we get the complimentary visit to the flower dome. It was certainly a satisfying lunch enjoying courses of uniquely exquisite food with the relaxing after meal walk in the flower dome. Would definitely go back. :
3
After booking the more formal downstairs we decided to go for the casual upstairs dining. The service was decent and the sommelier had some good ideas but the evening was let down by the quality of the over-priced food. Steak was chewy with slightly soggy fries and the chocolate brownie was dry and verging on stale. Missed opportunity
5
VIP treatment with buggy ride from main entrance. Complimentary entrance to flower dome. It's fine dinning.
4
So, the food. The taste of the food? Exquisite. The service? They serve kindly. The location? It matches so close with Gardens by the Bay! I have no words to say but it is amazing! 😁
1
Stopped here whilst in the gardens for a cup of tea at late afternoon. Three pots of tea and a Coke were $40 and all pots of tea were cold. No need to say more.
5
If you plan to visit flower dome, why not visiting Pollen for meal. Beautiful food and delicious. They also offer the buggy ride from the entrance to pollen entrance. Afterward, you can visiting flower dome. Recommend for both lunch or dinner, both have different atmosphere.
5
Food is definitely good. Environment is superb. And with the inclusion of entry into flower dome. Awesome service staffs.
3
The main course was not fantastic but the desserts were awesome! staffs were friendly! Didn't know that there was baggy services, took a 15-mins long walk from the carpark. The desserts are more value for money than the main course!
4
my friend was moving around in a wheelchair and there were limited options for us. this is one of the few dining options that could accommodate her. we were very impressed by the mains - beef ribs were so tender and flavorful. The apple tart was also mind blowing - we truly had parties going on in our mouths. to be dining in a lush and colorful greenery was really a great experience
3
Overall, a pleasant experience of dining within the Flower Dome of Gardens by the Bay. A buggy brings diners to the entrance of the restuarant. Starters of soft buns with garlic butter served in bamboo dim sum basket and homemade soursough and multigrains breads accompanied by hummus and freshly churned butter were good starts to the meal. Appetizer of beef carpaccio and kimchi complements each other well in texture and taste compartments. Goes well with Gerwurtraminer. Mains was monkfish with tzaziki sauce. While the fish has retained the succuclence and sweetness cooked sous vide, the accompanying tzaziki and gherkins were over poweringly sour, knocking off the balance of taste. Likewise for dessert, the amount of poached pear was too sheer and could be more significant to balance the richness of dark chocolate. Overall, the restaurant is well located and offers complimentary access into the flower dome. Culinary wise, more is expected and can be improved
3
In the Flower Garden dome you will find the Pollen Cafe with a nice layout and peaceful setting. The menu is a one-pager with a diverse set of offerings. It turns out the fish and chips is a large portion while the chili and pasta are smaller. You may want to verify your order as they forgot my wife's order but did adjust the bill. Nice clean restrooms and a place to cool off
1
My friend and I were at the Terrace at almost 8pm. Staff took awhile to give us the menus. They took awhile to make our drinks and we could tell 2 of them were trying to read a recipe for our cocktails. Waitress who served us drinks spilled some Natural Remedy Daiquiri on my leg and didn't apologise or give me serviettes. Calamari was dripping in oil. When we tried to order food again at about 9pm, they told us kitchen already closed at 8.30pm, but we were not asked for last orders at the time
2
Everyone was having afternoon tea when I was there, but it didn't look very inspiring. You need to book and I hadn't, so I just sat at the bar and had a coffee and rested my feet for a while.
4
This restaurant inside the big greenhouse in Gardens By the Bay provided a very nice little lunch of bruschettas and lovely cool drinks.
It made a quick tasty break during our day exploring the Gardens by the Bay.
4
Friendly and attentive staff, good service and overall good food. We ordered octopus leg and short rib mains with crab salad as starter.
2
Had a brief stop here
Service was awful
Stood waiting to be seated for 5 minutes with no eye contact
Took ages to get a menu
Tea arrived with no milk or sugar
Expensive and terrible service
DONT BOTHER

This is the sixth time I have visited Pollen, after a gap of 7 months, and I was surprised. Whilst Pollen Singapore is still not as good as I remember Pollen London (but its been 2 years) this time around both the set menu and the a la carte were very good. In particular, one guest loved their version of kinchi and said how well it complimented the beef, another was wowed by the mix of soft and crisp kale salad (better than the crab), yet another was bursting with enthusiasm about the fennel. As for the mains, strongly recommend the Iberia pork collar and the prosaic sounding beef & onions. The wine was pricey (over $400 for 2 bottles) but the ambiance was as usual totally delightful. A perfect Saturday or Sunday lunch. Nothing too heavy, then before dessert, a stroll around the gardens (free admission to the dome it is in) and then dessert, home and a quick nap
4
I chose Pollen since they have good vegetarian options. Happy with my decision since my wife and me both were able enjoy the food given my wife is a vegetarian. Definitely recommend this place for vegetarians who are looking for a very good fine dine restaurant.Note: The dome is very cold but can't blame the restaurant for that
4
They serve a reasonable high tea selection.What's great is that you have a free flow of tea and coffee from a good selection. The staff are very friendly. The only thing you need to remember is that you if you go there and have trouble finding the cafe, get a free buggy ride to the cafe. The cafe is in Flower dome but try to make a reservation. If you have high tea set there, Flower Dome entrance is complimentary. Remember leave a nice tip to the service staff!Suggestions : Have some local selection to the food set. Like curry puffs/samosas.It is in a tourist area
4
I've been to Pollen several times now. For lunch on the recent long weekend it was a perfect choice with visitors from out of town. The service is good, the set lunch menu at $55++ is the most reasonable way to enjoy the food, although portion sizes aren't huge. Wine prices are on the high side though so choose wisely. One thing to remember is that it's very chilly inside because of the greenhouse environment.
4
We had some colleagues in town and wanted to try something a little different. Wow what a great location. Food was superb. We would suggest that the size of the portion could be a little larger but with three courses we all had a great experience. The sommelier added to the event with great suggestions. We will be back.
5
My friend and I wanted to try out Pollen's high tea and we were not disappointed. We were immediately greeted by their staff member and Ms Cherry assisted us and made our tea time enjoyable and memorable! Awesome vibe and super delicious food which is really worth your money! You also get instant access to the flower dome when you dine in Pollen!Thank you Ms Cherry and Pollen staff for making our tea time memorable!
4
Stopped for a coffee whilst visiting the flower zone. Nice coffee and pleasant staff but too expensive for a basic coffee.
3
menu was average , service was average, maybe we picked a bad day. Was recommemded by someone local, but did not live up to it
5
This is one of the best meals we've ever had... a definite must, nestled within the lovely gardens by the bay, absolutely delightful nouvelle cuisine, don't be fooled by the size of the dishes - you'll be stuffed by the end of the evening. Many, many, options to pick from and a wine selection that is truly amazing. Genuine friendly staff, impeccable service, highly recommended whether visiting Singapore or looking for a place to share with family and friends - a real gem in the garden
3
We came here for lunch last weekend. Food was nice but we wished there were more options available. The price of 55++ for a weekend lunch set was reasonably ok but quite a number of the menu choices had a price supplement. So to get a 3 course meal we wanted, it was more like 95++ per set. We also order the wine and also cocktail tasting menu at 45++ per pax. For cocktails it was a good deal as you get regular sized cocktail serving but for wines one would expect a decent glass of wine not tasting portions. Service was lukewarm. The plus is that you get free entrance to the flower dome. There are so many other good restaurants in Singapore so we won't be in a rush to dine here again
4
We only stopped here for a quick coffee as we wandered through the Flower Dome and one of our party had gazpacho soup, and the latter was excellent. However, service was pretty disinterested, and what a shame the tables don't actually have a view to outside the dome ... We looked out at a wall with flower boxes and the 'dome' glass started above those, ie no view. Can't comment on the rest of the menu, I'm afraid.
3
The restaurant will arrange buggy to pick you from garden by the Bay Taxi stand to the restaurant, great!The potion of hi tea is small;This is second time we visit pollen hi tea within 5 months, the menu still the same, we hope to see some new menu;Taste is okay.Beverage is refillable, but if you were order hot coffee, then 2nd order if you order ice coffee, you will need to TOP up $2, FYI.The do have a alacarte menu but selection is limited, so we decided to order a tomato with avocado on a toast , still potion is like a lady palm size, but taste is good
1
It was a terrible experience getting to Pollen. We arrived and was directed to the main entrance to Flower Dome. When we were there, we were told to go back to the main entrance to take the buggy. Then they suggested that we make our own way 10 mins from where we were, under the hot sun, to Pollen. At the restaurant, our server sat us down but did not take our orders, neither did he tell us what we were to expect for our hi-tea After our meal, the same server brought us our bill then left our table and forgot about us. (Another table's server brought their bill, waited for the guest to pay and then proceeded to process her payment)We had to call for another server to collect out payment
2
Went over to Pollen for lunch, since there was 1 for 1 on entertainer, and we were in the area. In terms of ambience, it's really hard to beat. Nestled within the flower dome, you get a nice view of the river and partial skyline on one side, and the flowers on the other. But it only goes downhill from there. We were seated at the bar table, which is a really really big bar table. Somehow, rather than walking an extra 15 steps to come over to our side, the waitress started serving us by passing our drinks, and then utensils, and then food, and then sauces across the table. Now, the table is rather big, so I actually have to stretch to take it from her. I thought it was just a cup of water at first, so I didn't mind. But seriously, everything?! It felt like I was eating at some self-service fast food restaurant.And then the steak came. I ordered medium rare. The steak looked like it was boiled. No char at all on the outside. The first slices from the side still tasted okay, bland but still edible. The ones in the middle looks almost rare. (Photos attached)We left shortly after, very much unfulfilled. Thankfully, there's satay just down the street. We just took the $$ spent as entrance fee for the Flower Dome
3
Picked this place for a birthday eve dinner as I had the Entertainer app for 1-4-1 main course and decided to troop here from MBS Mixed Leaves Salad ($13) - nothing special and it came with some sort of very tart (too much!) dressing which was not impressive. Quite boring actually. It was unbearably tart so we had to ask them to replace it with a one on the side. 200 day grain fed black angus beef ($35) - Quite good but some parts of it were rather fatty and inedible. We were not told that it came with a side of the exact same salad as above - a headsup would be good as we would have picked another starter. Selection of 3 European cheese with crackers ($18) - rather sad looking for its price and portion of crackers were stingy. Had to pay $3 for extra crackers.Service - terrible! Unsure communication from staff and hesitant service, coupled with forgotten requests for water. Billing took extremely long as only the manager knew the process for the redemption. The good thing is, you can eat here, then walk around the Flower Dome already. The monies spent on the entrance tickets ($12 for 1x adult) can be better used for some bites and food here :)
5
My husband and I went to the terrace (second level) area of Pollen as the first level is fully booked and we are pleasantly surprised with the spaciousness of the area, to allow us good privacy for conversations. Eating there also gives us access to the flower dome which is an added bonus! :) Ordered the beef which is well cooked and tenderIt's a very peaceful and calming dinner experience, will be back again
5
Staff were well coordinated from booking to Dining but unfortunately didn't inform us about buggy service. We had to walk in which is quite far. Managed to get buggy when leaving though.
3
Thumbs up for ambience but need sunnies and hat ! The afternoon sun penetrates through the dome glass and felt warm and hot while having tea for 2 hrs..
Food not fantastic and the bread is kind of hard. Presentation is simple and no fuss.
4
This is more a restaurant for a special occasion or romantic dinner for two. Great food, service as you may expect. Wines overpriced, like in many more expensive Singapore restaurants. Free entrance to flower Dome is positive. Should not go here if you are a street food lover. To much difference in price and experience.
5
Highly recommended!We were there for high tea, staff were very polite and courteous to ask us on our diet preference to adjust the menu accordingly.Perfect environment!The snacks were exquisite and delicious. Although there were two that's not to my liking.Thereafter the access to the flower dome was just perfect for a light walk after the meal.Definitely will be back again for more
4
Our family was walking around gardens by the bay when we decided to have lunch there instead of heading to MBS. We decided to try out Pollen as we haven't been here before and didn't want to eat at cafes. All 3 of us had the set lunch at $55++. We got the crab salad for starters which is so awesome (avocado, pomelo, crab and vegs), for mains, we had wagyu beef spaghetti and seared fish, both are delicious! For desert, we tried their chocolate ice-cream, cereal bowl quinoa ice-cream and pumpkin ice-cream. Of the 3 my favorite is the pumpkin ice-cream. Very interesting flavor and surprisingly tasty- just the right balance of sweetness of me. Service is pretty good, we had complimentary canapÃ©s and madeline pastries at the end of our meal. Serving size is just nice for small eaters. Highly recommended for a special lunch if you are in the area.
3
Went here with my wife for dinner. We got pickup buggy from garden by the bay plaza and it took us 5min to reach this place.Ambience is good, staff is polite and attentive.We ordered 2 veg dishes and pairing wine with it and went to see flower dome . We returned after 35-40min and after which staff got our wine and food along with few tasting menu.Staff is quite attentive and make sure they go above and beyond to occupy our requirement by customizing food.I must admit that the tasting menu was much better than food we had ordered, which I found to be average considering prices are on higher side, though wine was good.Good to visit for experience, however don't keep much expectation with food taste and you might like it

Location is perfect for a quiet and beautiful lunch - loved the interior and setting as well. Wait staff was knowledgable and service was great. BUT - the food was below average on this visit. The food lack thought and had ingredients that didn't quite work with each other. The balance wasn't just right, and flavours - a little off. However, their dessert was well thought through and was innovative in concept. I particularly like the refreshing and nostalgic cereal bowl. Great dish. Loved their fresh herb tea. I would definitely visit again if the menu is refreshed - it was such a pity that I didn't really enjoy the food like i had wanted too. The reviews didn't really lived up to expectation. The buggy service is great and really gel the entire experience dining at Pollen

Food and ambience were good. I would recommend the early dinner special menu as it is value for money. By having an early dinner, you can get a nice view of the changing skies because of the sunset. The service was attentive but we still enjoyed our dining privacy. It was a memorable experience.

Had a nice lunch here last weekend. Food was very good, and staff very attentive. Being midday in Singapore, and dressed appropriately for lunch, worked up quite a sweat walking across from the Sands (accidentally going the looooong way around the gardens). Evidently the restaurant has their own private buggy, so do phone ahead and have them collect from the main entrance to the gardens

We visited Pollen several times over the years since it opened, usually on celebratory ocassions. I believe the menu changes at least once every few months as we never seen the same menu before. Among the many local restaurants that we have been to, Pollen remains one of our firm favourites. When you have been to many fine dining establishments, what truly elevates a dining experience to another level is not just how good the food tastes or how well the dishes are plated and presented. Those are the basic expectations along with attentive service and a nice ambience. What diners want is to be suprised. I am not talking about using exotic ingredients or conjuring culinary illusions to trick the diner's senses. I am talking about combining flavours that are so delicately balanced and refreshing it makes you wonder why no one has ever done it before. And that is the feeling we get everytime we visited Pollen. The food is creatively executed but yet not ostentatious or pretentious. The ambience there completes the dining experience. Forget about the Singapore Michelin guide and head to Pollen

very nice service and food, great value of money, tried their tasting menu, wonderful. very full even with 2 ppl sharing

The service was great. However, the afternoon tea set was quite plain. The coffee latte's milk was poorly steam (very bubbly)

Had dinner with our team and the food was excellent!thank you for taking such good care of us!and kudos to the chef!

Had an enjoyable lunch with a special curated menu from Chef, food and service was excellent. Staff was really attentive and the overall experience make it worth the while to travel here for lunch! Excellent start to my Monday! Kudo to the team!!

Good food. Fantastic presentation. Servers were friendly and know their food well. Every dish was colorful and special. Cosy environment.Was there for my birthday lunch with the family. Instead of the usual cake for the occasion they had an unique lollipop dessert.Keep up the good work
5
I've visited Pollen several times. Each time I'm impressed with both the service levels and the quality of food. The location is stunning and the only downside is that the temperature is quite cool, although the friendly staff will happily give you a shawl to keep you warm. This is another place I highly recommend for visitors to Singapore. You can read more on my Singapore Foodie blog, or download the ap

My fiancÃ©e and I stopped by Pollen for a late lunch when visiting the Flower Dome.The restaurant is nicely located and somewhat private in that it is shielded from the rest of Flower Dome by vegetation.The menu is rather small however the quality of the food was good. They also serve alcoholic drinks.Somewhat pricey but the location is nice and it is the only place to have a good rest and something to eat within Flower Dome.There was plenty available tables when we visited, hence no need to make reservations
4
We had initial concerns as to whether our dining experience would be different given the change of executive chef at the helm. We are glad that the quality of the food and service remains very good, even though it was a busy day when we were there: a weekend and the first day of the Flower Show. We had the Gourmet Set Lunch and especially enjoyed the crab salad with kale and the beef carpaccio with kimchi. The choice of the cereal bowl with quinoa ice-cream as a finishing dessert however was anti-climatic
4
What a lovely experience dining in the Flower Dome! It was a bit cold but the waitress offered me a Pashmina shawl, such great service. However we were a bit disappointed with the Tomahawk steak as it was a bit dry and they did not have finishing salt. So food quality fell a bit short of fine dining standard. But overall a great experience, perfect for impressing your significant other and business associates
5
The other reviews state that the service was poor, but my friend and I experienced phenomenal and attentive service. My friend had felt sick all day, but was feeling better by dinner so we kept our reservation. However, as the meal progressed, she began to feel sick again. We had to leave dinner early to get her back to the hotel, and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. They brought her teas to sooth her stomach, some special dish that was supposed to ease her nausea, and they knocked 20% off our bill, even though we had said we would pay in full. Very classy!The foot itself was phenomenal as well, and I only wish we had been well enough to enjoy it completely. My friend and I are vegetarian, and I had actually thought Pollen was exclusively vegetarian, but it is not. It does, however, have a delicious vegetarian menu, and we each selected the tasting menu of 9 courses. My friend got about halfway through, and I made it through 7 before we had to leave. Unique dishes, wonderful robust flavor, and varied presentation kept it interesting and fun! Yes, the dishes came slowly, but I would expect that in such a fine dining setting, with that extent of attention to detail.If you do a tasting menu, be sure to plan a couple of hours for dinner. We probably spent 2-2.5 hours there before leaving early.Yes, it is cold to preserve the vegetation in the Flower Dome, but they provide shawls :)Charming place and great culinary experience. Thank you for taking good care of us, too

Beautiful modern food. Great vegetarian. Wine list is also very good with nice selections for everyone.

Last week we had lunch there.The staff wasn't very friendly and attentive.We ordered the olives with feta and almonds as a starter. Big mistake, for 12 $smashed olives , 2 almonds and very little pieces of bad feta cheese.The other day I ordered the same dish at # The Halia ...much better. Then I had the green salad in a bowl which was very inconvenient to handle. Only green salad again 12 $. My companion ordered the sandwich with the tandoori chicken. ..not good..extremely dry and burned. When the dessert was served the waiter didn't want to clean the table, she wanted to put the brownie, btw the only option, somewhere...till I ask to clean the table! Additionally it was freezing cold, so that it was anyway almost impossible to enjoy, I told the waiter and he only said, that I'm right....we will never return..all in all I payed 80$ for a real bad lunch
3
We had a family lunch here but service was so slow and our order was not properly taken for both pre meal drinks and the meal. One of us was presented with a totally different starter as the chosen one had not been properly ordered. This did arrive some time later. Very slow to bring our meals. In total we were in the restaurant for 3 hours and only had two courses, no coffee or desserts. The bread was tasty and the meals were too but they were not hot. They took ages to take our wine order and then it was kept on the bar and our glasses were not refilled. We had to ask for it and only one person was allowed to serve it. It is a very nice location and the decor is modern but they really do need to look at their service
4
Really really good food and the location (inside the dome) is spectacular. The restaurant itself is basic/cheap cafe style i.e. a missed opportunity. And it is freezing - take a sweater/pashmina/coat anything. The temperature that's great for the flowers and for viewing them is cold when sat still for more than 10 minutes. The food and location win out in the end.
5
Our family of 3 dined at this elegantly appointed restaurant next to the flower gardens of Gardens by the Bay. The decor was plush yet private. The service staff were very pleasant, courteous, throwing in occasional friendly conversations and explanation of all that we ordered. Food was excellent, served with exquisite cutlery and aptly spaced between courses. Full marks to a highly trained and spontaneous staff. The buggy ride to the taxi stand is an added luxury. I know what you want to know next - the prices are not over the top for what all we got.
5
Our memorable and delightful celebratory lunch began with the polite and jovial restaurant staff picking us up from the buggy point conveniently located near the information counter of Gardens By the Bay South. We were again warmly welcomed by the Pollen team and seated by a window table which had spectacular views of the Bay Area, including the Singapore Flyer. The restaurant staff were all very knowledgable about the items on the menu, explaining to us what's new and made good recommendations. The highlights were the appetisers and desserts which were innovative, made with the freshest cleverly combined ingredients and very well presented. Our lunch ended with cup of well brewed coffee and the surprise birthday macaroons. We took the recommendation to visit the Lilly flower exhibition, joined a short guided tour to learn more about the flowers and the dome. Will definitely be back again to celebrate special occasions. Thank you and kudos to the staff of Pollen and Flower Dome

My first visit with my girlfriend for dinner after a walk at cloud forest and flower dome. We were greeted by the host(cane remember the host name but she has a sweet smiLe) who brought us to our seats and also she took the initiative to show us the vegetarian menu other than the usual ones as my girlfriend is a vegetarian.They also took the initiative to recommend dishes and wines when they noticed we were quite indecisive about what to order. The staff were quite observant making sure our drinks were refill and also making sure that our orders were being served with being wait for too long. Canopys were being served(the staff even introduce the canopys and the ingredients that is within the canopy) while waiting and when we are done with our main course, dessert were being served too! Overall the quality of the food was good abd the staff were all quite observant, friendly and initiative. Though it is pricey but it is definitely worth to be back for a visit again
4
A great way to spend the afternoon! Simple and nice sweet pastries and savories. After which take a walk in the flower dome. It's money well spent this way then pay the entrance fee for the flower dome. The restaurant staff are very well-trained and polite.
4
This restaurant is located inside the flower dome in Gardens by the Bay. Lovely views of Marina Bay Waterfront. Meals as with all high class restaurants very small serves. Not a great choice of meal. Staff very attentive. As inside the dome this restaurant is quite cool due to the air conditioning, an extra covering of some sort is required
5
I think a lot of people are not aware that Pollen restaurant and terrace is different. The entrance that you see from the Flower Dome, it's actually Terrace (not restaurant). The good food is actually from the Restaurant, NOT terrace.We didn't really bother to try the terrace menu as it seems a little bit pricey with nothing too special. So we went ahead to the restaurant to try their Gourmet Set Lunch. $55 ++ per pax (7%GST + 10% Service charge).There's a elevator that brought us to the restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is TOTALLY Different than the Terrace. We love lunch because it's always not too pricey (compare to dinner), and we get to see the nice view in the bright day light. It's quite a special experience as like dining in a cooler temperature garden (imagine the constant warm weather in singapore). Food is exquisite and the service is great. A restaurant that is worth coming back for a special lunch or dinner

I met a friend here for tea. An ordinary pot of tea (not served with milk or sugar) was nearly $10. We also had an order of olives, almonds, and feta cheese. It turned out to be a tiny bowl for $15! Rip off!
3
good overall. Not value for the meal served but love the limou buggy.
Servers had difficult English accent, I think from China, which made understanding the dish difficult.
5
Food was great~ also the service was the best!! Moreover, we could see the flower dome for free!! Beautiful~!!
5
Wow, from the moment we arrived I was super impressed. The interiors are tastefully decorated, modern but not cold, a beautiful blend of understated elegance and yet simple at the same time. staff were attentive but unobtrusive. The wine waiter was helpful with recommendations to go with the menu we chose. Portions are not huge so I managed 3 courses without feeling full. I didn't pay....wealthy son did....but I gather it wasn't cheap
4
A place for fine dining. Buggy service was prompt and the Pollen team has been very attentive to all our needs. Food were well presented and tasty. A complementary bottle of wine from Citibank credit card that makes the dinner all worthwhile. It's a pity we didn't get to visit the flower dome as it close at 9, we finished our dinner at 9 plus
5
My family dined at Pollen to celebrate a special occasion and we all had the degustation menu. Each course was executed beautifully, tasted great and timed to perfection. We do have healthy appetites but struggled with the portions! The dome in which the restaurant is nestled makes for a unique ambience too

I was so excited to get a reservation at Pollen on my recent trip to Singapore. We had booked afternoon tea at approx. 4pm. As I had been to many around the world I was expecting a lot of great food and drink. I was disappointed as all we received were 10 really small 'bruschetta' types with great flavours and 10 small sweets with a drink selection.Although it sounds like a lot, I felt that at $45SGD that we could have had a little more.The service was also disappointing as it was even hard to get someone's attention to ask for a glass of water. The only upside, was that we got entry into the Flower Dome.Probably would not retur
5
Prior to our reservation time the wait staff walked us in to the Flower Dome for a free visit, which we enjoyed. Our family of 5 then had a lovely dinner with additional courses provided that were both beautifully presented and delicious. My main meal was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. The staff were very helpful, providing a kiddy version of fish and chips for our little boy and then tinkering with a dessert for one of our daughters. We appreciated their extra assistance and would definitely recommend the restaurant because of the food, service and setting

This is a review for only Pollen Terrace as we did not go to the ground floor fine dining area. Our 2 little kids were with us and we decided to go for the all day bistro menu instead. Although please note that they share the same kitchen. Also please note that it is rather "cold" here in the Flower Dome. It felt like 19 degrees celsius the whole time we were there, so please remember to bring a light jacket or sweater. We went on a Saturday and it opened at 12 noon so we had no problem getting a table, but after we left the place was fully booked for afternoon tea. We ordered: 1) the Garlic sourdough, hummus, slow-cooked egg ($14); 2) the Chicken "Tandoori", ciabatta, grilled onions, paprika aioli ($25); 3) the Linguini Puttanesca ($26); 4) the Beef sandwich, red onion salsa, salad ($32); and 5) the 200-day grain-fed Black Angus beed inside skirt from Stockyard, fries, salad & piccalilli sauce ($35). Everyone loved the food and we had wonderful service from two staff in particular: Gadaffi (the bar supervisor) and Shah (part-time waiter). I would highly recommend this spot for people who would like to spend more time in the flower dome and wouldn't mind something more casual

Coolest thing about this restaurant is the location: being able to dine with nature! Back of my seat were sage, mint and rosemary plants. Of course, dining here means free entry to the dome exhibits, and I got to view cherry blossoms after.Hightea was just average..but for the price I can't complain much.Hits: The scones with homemade jam and cream. Oh my god! The brownie was good and fudgy too.Misses: Everything else on the menu...the savoury sandwiches were something that can be replicated at home, bread was dry. They forgot my macarons and we had to ask for them

Recommended for friends and family gathering. Nice ambience and good service. Free entry to flower dome.

After walking throught eh Garden Dome,we came across Pollen right in the corner of the dome. It is a beautiful place to have a coffe,it was like a little cafe away from all the people in the dome, Service was ok and coffee was ok.

Service and ambience were great. Have higher expectations on food but felt it can be better value 😜 Hehe thank you my two cents

My family and I went to Pollen as a treat for their last night in Singapore. I'd initially booked a table for 19.30 but was very easily able to change it to 19.00 in order to take advantage of the set dinner menu (3 courses, petit fours and a glass of cava for $88++ each), this was a bit pricey but definitely worth it as a celebration.The wait staff were attentive, offering us each a pashmina to hold off the chill of the air con. The variety and quality of the petit fours was lovely - we particularly enjoyed the marshmallows on sticks with chocolate rocks which the chef came out to blow torch in front of us after dessert. The portion sizes were very good as well and the food was an amazing quality. Would definitely visit again and can recommend taking advantage of the free entry into the Flower Garden for a pleasant walk after dinner

If you love value for money, reasonable portions, good service, do not go to PollenWe have never been more disappointedIt is a total waste of money and you will need to eat on the way homeWe are restaurant lovers in Singapore. There are so many better optionsSeriously and with respect, do not waste your tim

I took my fiancee to Pollen for dinner on Saturday 14 May to celebrate her birthday and was blown away by how poor the overall experience was. To begin with, when we called today to make the booking, we were told that the earliest booking we could get was at 8pm. We don't typically eat that late so pushed for earlier and were able to get a table at 730. When we arrived, there were 5 or 6 other tables seated. I thought there would be more people arriving throughout the night and this strategy would have been to relieve the pressure on the staff. It wasn't. There were only ~8 tables seated the whole night. However, when we wanted to order food it was a struggle to get someone to our table. We ordered the degustation selection. The menu said it was only served from 630-900 - How can it be served from 630 if the restaurant doesn't open before 730?The wait staff asked if we had any dietary requirements. We said we don't eat pork (preference not religion but somewhat common in this part of the world). We were served pork on 2 dishes throughout the meal.We asked to swap out the foie gras for something else and the wait staff asked the chef and came back with two options. We selected the first (something with potatoes). Nine minutes later the wait staff came out to tell us that she had "misheard" the chef and presented us with two other options. Neither were as appealing to us but we selected one to get things moving.We were seated at 8 (after walking around the gardens briefly) and had received 2 dishes and the bread by 930. It took 1.5hrs to get to the bread. We had booked for 730 and 2hrs in we had less than half of our meal. At this point, the saving grace of the meal was the smoked butter, if it hadn't been so good I wouldn't have eaten so much bread and would have had to get something else to eat on the way out. We asked one of the waiters to speed things up. He agreed and said that he'd send the dishes out one after the other. The dishes came out quicker but at one point, one of the wait staff began putting cutlery out for my fiancee while she was still eating the previous dish. I looked at her and laughed as if to say "How can it get any worse?!" and he left without setting my cutlery. When it got to desserts they delivered the first one after a brief wait (likely because we had requested promptness). However, the next two desserts were delivered at the same time. It felt like the wait staff had rushed it. It felt like the staff were annoyed with us and wanted to get the dishes dropped ASAP.Overall, the food was flavourless except for a few dishes. We really enjoyed the salmon/crab dish as it had multiple flavors and textures. When ordering this style of menu, I was expecting these kinds of dishes throughout. I was sadly disappointed. There were some other parts of dishes that were acceptable but overall we were underwhelmed. Considering the location, the ambience was sorely lacking. I understand that you have to battle with the temperature of the flower dome but the lack of music and bright lighting made me feel like I would have been more comfortable in the caves of Mordor. When we asked for the bill we were told that there would be a buggy waiting for us that could take us to the taxi stand. We said that it would be great as it would save us a walk. However, as we were walking out, we were told that we would have to either wait five minutes for the buggy to return or walk eight minutes to the carpark (although it's only a five minute walk). Personally, I felt like the staff were spitting in our faces after the service that we had receive. We opted to walk.We don't go out to eat often in Singapore because the service is so poor. We figured that if we're paying a premium price we should get a at least standard service if not better. We were wrong. I had approached management with these complaints and met with them to discuss. They acknowledged the issues and offered another visit to a one of the other restaurants in their chain. We had been to another of the restaurants the previous year for my fiancees birthday and the service was worse plus they ran out of some of the dishes. I left that experience annoyed and hungry. There was no way I'm going back to another of their venues again so declined. Hopefully they can improve but I wouldn't opt to go to Pollen or any of the Unlimited Collection's restaurants again

We only went in because we were hot and wanted to sit down and get cool. We ordered two main courses and two juices. The calamari plate had approximately 8 pieces and while delicious was nothing special and cost around $24, which is around $3 a ring! This was no more than a very ordinary cafe meal and we were charged around $80. Our waiter was sweet but inexperienced, the dishes arrived at different times and were lukewarm. It's a small space that only survives because of its location. This is a place that doesn't care about its customers - I'd bet there wouldn't be many repeat visits - and is cynically raking in the money from tired tourists. Don't bother - enjoy the gardens, jump in a cab and go to a food court and spend a fraction of the amount on some exciting local food. NOT recommended

Afternoon Tea at Pollen was something we have been wanting to do a for a while. So with Taylor's 17th birthday coming up and with the last day of the tulip festival coming up we decided to book for a family afternoon tea.The girls glammed up, off we went.Well from the time we arrived and until my daughter meet her friend the chef, it was pretty hopeless.Service was terrible, despite booking for 5 people we were shown a table that two people would struggle to eat at, eventually after a long argument we were moved to a larger table.After 30mins water was delivered to the table in glasses that smelled of fish and eggs. After another 10minutes we received the afternoon tea the savoury dishes were finger thin but tasty and the deserts were delicious.Then my daughter met her friend the chef and everything changedI'm not sure I would return the staff looked exhausted and the 6pm dinner service was about to start

Car driver warned us on the way in from Changi that the food in Gardens by the Bay wasn't good value. Should have listened. Pollen is in the Flower Dome (which is great) but trades on its location to offer extremely average food at inflated prices. Service is lacklustre bordering on indifferent, with meals served at widely different times without apology or explanation. Drinks are vastly overpriced and small. Pollen management should take a trip to the Biodomes at the Eden Project in the UK if they want see how to offer quality, inexpensive food that fits with the conservation theme of the gardens. A shame that Singapore has the Gardens really right, but the food options so wrong..

Booked our reservation online and got the shuttle transfer to the restaurant.Is this a fine dining restaurant? No it isn't. Although they try to be. Napkin was not set on our laps. Cutlery had to be asked for. The service is far from fine dining. The food however is decent enough. With my favourite being the scallop tarte although the menu might be seasonal.Dinner includes entry to the flower dome although we were not advised about this until we asked before we left where the other side of the restaurant led to.I don't think I'd go back but for those who haven't been then it might be worthwhile to go there for the ala carte menu.

Went for a Set Lunch which is affordable. Very nice setting in the Flower Dome. Friendly staff. Good food with some unusual flavor combinations.
After lunch you can visit the Flower Dome for free.

The waiters were busy with flirting to each other. The portions Where microscopic and absolutely overpriced. They chased Indian family from one table to another.

Food light... fresh and reasonably prices... service friendly yet lacking consistency with follow up.

Foigras were awesome, the wagyu was very good and tender. Waiters were very cheerful, the service was fast, excellent and the food was fantastic. All good. A must try!

We had relatively high expectations for our meal in Pollen, given that it's part of the Marina Bay complex and surrounded by the beauty of the Flower Dome. It was, however, a total disappointment. The restaurant was understaffed, and the food was dreadful - we got a pizza that was cold and a 'toasted' chicken sandwich that was not toasted and included ropy chicken thighs (including skin and fat). The fountain soda water cost a staggering $6.50. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant; if you're starving go to the Marina Bay mall food court

Have to confess - came here with very high expectations. Family lunch during our Easter break hoilday in Singapore. Saw a familiar name in a really nice setting (Gardens by the Bay is superb!) and wanted to cap our wonderful day out with a good meal. Had an early lunch on a weekday.Front of restaurant. It would really help if waiting staff are trained to look out for guests waiting to be seated. It's 1155hrs or thereabouts. Staff should not be navel gazing or doing administration at the expense of making guests wait at the front of the restaurant. Front doors were open but the restaurant certainly wasn't open for business in our view.Service. Over-practised, affected, unnatural and bordering on being lazy. Our main waiter was not someone I would described as being conversationally competent in English. Slurred his way through lunch with weird mannerisms and even harder to follow diction. When we tried to clarify whether there were any peanuts in one of our dishes (our son is severely allergic to peanuts), we got a casual couldn't be bothered "oh no....there are no peanuts....only normal nuts". What on earth are normal nuts? Just smacks of shockingly poor or negligent training or they're just hiring the wrong folk to wait on tables here. Got the sense most of the staff didn't even know the menu that well and could not really describe how food was prepared/cooked/presented. A big letdown. Should really learn a thing or two from Restaurant Andre. Weirdest practice came right at the end. We paid for lunch with cash, included the automatically calculated tip in the bill (grudgingly) and then left the place - and then had said waiter come charging out of the place running after us waving our cash at us. Now at this point, maybe we're being overly sensitive, but we're thinking this looks to everyone like we're doing a runner....and it then turns out he has this requirement of needing to count out our cash in front of us, which he duly did outside the restaurant in front of goodness knows how many people around us....amount turns out to be correct and said waiter walks away. A fitting end to confirm all our misgivings about this place really. Kitchen and Food. Dishes were reasonably well cooked. Ingredients were fresh but overall presentation was somewhat insipid. So pretty average and ordinary which is a disappointment at these prices. What I really took umbrage at was how rigid the kitchen was. We're a fussy bunch. So there's plenty of stuff we like and a lot of other stuff we don't. We tried asking the waiter (see communication issues above) if some of the dishes could be adjusted or swapped around. Let's just say the response was the closest thing to "Computer Says No" I've come across in a top end restaurant. Wholly unexpected and wholly unacceptable. Just smacks of a chef too caught up with his own hype. Speaking of the chef - really - we arrived when there were 3 tables occupied in an early lunch setting - with an open kitchen setup and easy access to diners - we didn't so much as get a hello or an introduction or (later) an explanation on why the dishes can't be altered or swapped etc. Second class to the core.Setting. Gardens is a truly spectacular attraction and you can't really fault the setting. Restaurant was well laid out and well appointed. Window seats overlook sweaty joggers panting away in the afternoon...Total damage $300+ (about Â£160-170) for a family of 4. Could not have been more poorly spent. Our worst dining experience in the 2 and a half weeks we were in Singapore

Had a lovely time at Pollen with my girlfriend during an anniversary The food was innovative and really delicious, the staff were attentive and gave honest advice and a few sweet surprises. Only thing is the meal set us back nearly $250 so I'd only return on a very special occasion (which fortunately this was!) Pollen helped set the mood and my gf was delighted with the experience. Later that evening she agreed to be my fiancee

this is my second time here despite knowing that the food is very mediocre (for the price). the ambience is just fantastic, located in an air-conditioned glass dome surrounded by greenery. the air is filled with floral scents from the garden. the lunch set is only $55 although we took the veal option which added $20 to the bill. bread and butter were very good, appetisers were alright, mains were served cold and rather tasteless, and dessert was supremely unexciting (the cereal bowl had some really hard bits of unpopped rice). service was initially brilliant but then we got a sommelier with a really strong chinese accent we didn't understand at all (and we are singaporean-chinese!) and also it was very hard to get the attention of the waitstaff once a large group arrived despite the fact the restaurant was still half-empty. the cheese selection is broad but not particularly impressive but the wine selection to go with the set lunch was pretty good and only $15/glass (the menu doesnt say that the promotion is exclusive to the set lunch, but they charged us a lot for the exact same wines when we ate from the ala carte menu previously). overall, i would still come back although next time i would stick to the cheapest set lunch options and go to town with the $15 wines. also make use of the alternate exit into the flower dome (no ticket required

I visited Pollen yesterday with a friend. I was really looking forward to eating there as I had heard a lot about it. We reached the restaurant around 12.30 and opted to dine at the Terrace, which carries a different menu from the restaurant downstairs. We sat down and asked for the menu. The Terrace menu has extremely limited choices. Anyway, we selected Greek Salad ( 16$) and Sourdough with slow cooked egg and Humus. We also requested for two glasses of normal water. We waited for half an hour before reminding our waiter that we had asked for water. He mumbled something and went away and there was no sight of water that we had asked for. A few minutes later we caught the attention of another waitress and reminded her that we had asked for water and after having waited for 40 minutes, we got our glass of water. Then a few minutes later the waiter arrived with the Greek Salad and my instant reaction was that maybe there is a mistake, because the dish he brought did not look like a Greek Salad. He insisted that that was in fact the Greek Salad. I asked him where are are the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives that were given in the description in the menu. He pointed out literally 2 pieces of cucumber, 1 piece of tomato and a few pieces of onion. Besides these, there were 6 big croutons and some crumbled feta cheese in the salad. The portion was the same size that one gets served in an airline meal. I questioned it and he said he will bring the manager. The manager came around and asked what the issue was. When I explained to him, he said what would I like him to do. I told him that this salad was unacceptable and I would like to leave. I also informed him about the bad service, and he just said "ok"!! No apologies, no effort to say that I will bring another portion for you, nothing. My friend and I were really upset and we left the restaurant. What is more appalling is that the restaurant and its staff feel and know that they can get away with bad service and bad quality of food. They know that the customers have no recourse. I will never go back to Pollen or recommend it to anybody

We started off our family holiday in Singapore at Pollen.Previously we have been to Pollen social in London and had a fabulous time so we had a high bar to compare to and it didn't disappoint.The setting is fabulous and the restaurant was lovely.We found the service excellent and the food was as good as the London restaurant with an Asian twist.The meal was great value but the drinks- as in Singapore in general- very expensive!Lunch was topped off but a wander around the gardens- highly enjoyable
5
Great food and wine! Starting from the main gate, the ride that takes you to the restaurant is perfect. I'd like to visit again soon.
4
A nice restaurant that serves quality food & tea with good ambiance after appreciating the flowers. A little pricey though, it is a good place to rest your tired feet with a cuppa of tea or coffee.
5
I have visited Pollen a number of times for dinner in the past and this was my first lunchtime visit. My friends and I had the 3 course lunch special- $55 +tax and service charge was great value especially considering that you gain free entry into the flower dome (@ gardens by the bay). The food was delicious and service was good. Would definitely recommend to others
2
Is there any service? No, nothing at all. However, the cool face of the waiter and waitress is for free! Need to wait 10 minutes for the order and another 40 minutes for the food. We are two families with a kid and a baby, imagine that! The waitress kept silent and cool when served the drink and food, impatient. Hey, you were not paid this month
5
Very thoughtful to provide buggy ride from Garden by the Bay entrance to the restaurant as it is a long walk & very hot. Great service by the staff & nice reminder of the beef main course is a pasta dish as I thought that is a steak. Though the food is good, it is not impressive. I personally like the salmon starter and the multi-grain bread. A walk in the dome after the lunch is just perfect with a buggy ride back
1
In total there are not a large numbers of disappointments in Singapore.... But if you are looking for one, go to this place. The staff is very unfriendly and really not service oriented at all... And last but not least the food is not worth the price! A no-go place! Save the time for other places...

We decided to have our lunch here at Pollen before our visit to the flower dome at the Gardens by the Bay. The indoor atmosphere was good with a view and we were surrounded by greenery and plants. I love my Angus skirt beef with pasta main course.
4
I came here for my birthday and was surprised by the good quality good in a beautiful environment! After the meal you can take your time to walk it off in the flower dome.The only downside was the annoying number of people randomly walking in/through from the dome from a side entrance having a look and being told this was a restaurant. Management need to manage this better.Tip: Enter through the back of the flower dome along the promenade to avoid paying any entry fee to get to the restaurant. Not only do you have a nice meal but you get in the dome for free

Four of us ladies went for the high tea which consisted of a selection of five savoury (so-so) and five sweets (yums!) and choice of coffee and several types of tea. At $38++, it was fairly decent. Service was efficient and pleasant. What made it a great experience for us was sitting amongst all the beautiful foliage, with a view of the water and sky while sipping our tea and nibbling on the bites. The coolness and the ambience of the Gardens took us to a temperate zone, totally out of the heat-filled Singapore, which was fantastic. If you're just going for the food, well don't expect to be blown away. Be there to soak in the whole experience of dining amongst nature. Awesome
5
Dropped in at Pollen while visiting the flower garden and enjoyed a tasty lunch of dukkah with poached egg and hummus, French fries and fruit sodas. Special appreciation to the manager who served us complimentary entree and drinks in addition to our order when our docket had been forgotten by the waiter - great service and well handled.
5
Pollen is simply awesome. They exceed your expectation in terms of environment, service and food quality. If they can improve the wine comes with the lunch menu, that would be perfect.
3
This is a pleasant cafe inside the air con flower dome. If you are ordering tea just beware the "hydroponics", it will probably be the most expensive cup of tea I have ever had.
3
Afternoon tea prepared well in advance and refrigerated =chewy macarons, bread slices with stale cornered bread. Nice setting and good service though.
2
Took drink orders that never arrived, ask them not to bother as we had finished our cake. Then still added service charge...
4
We ordered Foie Gras, Shoulder Tenderloin Wagyu Beef, Salmon, Red Cabbage Risotto, Mixed Leaves Salad and 3x Cheese. The portions are big enough for sharing. The restaurant serves bread, crackers and canapÃ©s as starters. Really good! Overall, great service, ambience and food. Worth a visit! Would definitely recommend it to others.

This is my first TripAdvisor review as I felt the urge to write about pollen. I invited some business guest for a lunch and we really enjoyed the food. The menu offers variety and interesting taste combination. It was in no comparison to the service offered, just a few mentions: they lost our total order (written) and had to come again, glasses of wine were never filled, bread was brought to our table, but after something non audible was said it was taken back, getting the wrong plates in front of us, we had to ask 3 times for the bill and we had to hear that the beer which was clearly rotten, couldn't be because it came from a bottle. All these things might sound as acceptable, but considering all staff interactions, it was eventually my guest making comment about it. Felt disgraced as a host. Never to come here again, despite the lovely food, there are just better choices. If you decide to dine here, take some warm clothes due to the location in the flower dome. It gets quite cold

We went to Pollen for a special birthday celebration with high expectations, based on some reviews we had read. Though the restaurant is frigid to the point of needing heaters and shawls, the setting is magnificent in the spectacular Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. Unfortunately, the food was a let down, and over-priced at that. While the small beetroot and scallop starters that we tried were a good beginning, the main courses were unacceptable. The wagyu beef steak was over-salted to the point of being inedible. The risotto with burnt cabbage also had to be abandoned. A proper standard of service would have seen an adjustment to the bill and direct apology from the manager when food was sent back uneaten with a clear explanation to the waiter as to why. However, neither was forthcoming. We are global travellers and professionals in the hospitality business. Paying over $200 for this would have been no problem if the food had been first rate. But in reality the experience took some of the shine off of our special evening
4
Pollen provides a cool peaceful oasis from the heat and bustle of Singapore. I recommend their afternoon tea which is served in the small restaurant in the flower dome. Do not expect traditional English afternoon tea with crusts off triangular sandwiches, instead you will be served open oblong rustic bread with different toppings - salmon, chicken, beef, mozzarella cheese and hummus - each with a tantalising combination of flavours. Afterwards enjoy the sensation of crafted delicacies - passion fruit meringue, coffee macaron, banana bread, fruit scone with jam & cream and chocolate brownie. There is a good choice of teas and coffees or enjoy a long glass of Anna fizz. Afterwards a gentle saunter to take in the usually beautiful floral displays.If you make a reservation a buggy will take you to the restaurant from where you will be escorted to your table upstairs
5
I must admit that service is average and slow. BUT, food is amazing. This is what I call a full dining experience on a sunny sunday afternoon (tho service rlly could be improved on), the atmosphere of flowers all around you that smell nothing short of fresh together with the very nicely paired furniture and design of the restaurant. Not sure how it is in the evening because I only went there during brunch time
4
We had the valentines set menu which was 5 courses and all very different. The staff were friendly and picked us up in a golf buggy driving us to the light show and then to the restaurant. We were then allowed into the gardens at night for a walk which was very romantic.The food was very good! I enjoyed every course especially the beef! It's is all very much lightly cooked so be aware of that if its not your thing.Overall a great night out and lovely food despite the fairly hearty price tag
4
Abit pricey but food and service were definitely good. Plus you get a free entry to the flower dome so why not?
5
The restaurant has a beautiful setting and the food was great. The staff were fab and we had a walk round the flower dome afterwards.
2
Overall service was very slow, they forgot to bring the starter bread. They only brought it upon request... They were not like this before...
Very unpleasant time spend for my wife's birthday lunch. Hope it gets better.
5
Beetroot starter was surprisingly delicious (given that I'm not usually a beetroot fan). Barramundi was perfectly cooked - great texture with a crispy outside layer.
4
Went there for our anniversary celebration. The reservation gives free entrance to the Flower Dome and the view of Singapore flyer and city re amazing.
Food quality is good and we enjoyed the great service too
1
I did not book for full course meals and testing menu.
My friends went there and recommended me to order alacart as they are always come and order. But the staffs insist to push me the full course meals.
5
Came with my wife and found the food good. Will come again another time to try the other dishes here.
5
Actually, even if you are not there, it's worth a flight! The fact that it is inside the dome means that you get a break from the tropical heat outside. It smells like you are in the middle of the country though due to the restaurant's herb garden. The food is great - innovative without pushing too far. Service is amazing too. I can't wait for an excuse to go back
5
We had a wonderful evening at this restaurant. We opted for the tasting menu but choose our own wine, each course was really good. The service was great, they asked at what pace we would like to be served. I really liked this as often it comes to quickly.My favourite part was the desserts and port.. really really good
4
A friend and I had a lovely set menu lunch and the food was outstanding, delicate and superbly prepared. Good Service. Little pricey on the extras however....Wine is around 18 dollars a glass, bubbles $30 per glass, cheese platter an extra +- $10.00. I feel this would deter many of the tourists visiting Gardens by the Bay. One great perk is you are able to go inside one of the domes for no charge and we were blessed with the cherry blossom display.
3
Not a big fan. Very expensive, slow and tedious. Positive was the ambiance of being in the garden dome.
5
My wife and i went to Pollen to celebrate our wedding anniversary yesterday. Service staff were attentive and food was great. It was an excellent dining experience.
2
This was my second visit. I found the service and taste of food were not very impressive any more. I celebrated my birthday but I will chose other place for my future celebration. A little disappointed.
5
Perfect resto to both enjoying the food, and conversation.
Was very good choice to invite Our American guest here.
2
Came here for our birthday celebration. Didn't really enjoyed my food, especially the aged sirloin steak which was amazingly tough. I called to inform the restaurant that we will be late as my gf was delayed by her event and were told by the staff that they couldn't hold the seats for us. I had to rush down first to find the restaurant practically empty.
4
Not cool like in Cool Man but like Chilly Cool.Great sanctuary on an otherwise hot humid day (are there any other types of day in Singapore)Paula had the bruscetta and I the calamari. Very tasty and just the right snack size treat for a light lunch.Staff very friendly and efficient
3
Pollen is all about location at Gardens by the Bay; save your disappointment eating there with the poor service and go to Bay Sands Hotel. I went for lunch ($55) with their drink pairings ($33) plus tip and GST for approx. $105 Singaporean-- a lot to pay for bad service.The hostess was unwelcoming and leered at me when I entered. That should have been my first sign; you know what they say about first impressions--they are lasting. It went down from there with my server who spilled the bread on me, picked it up with his fingers and then brushed them on his uniform. And when he served it, I had to get out my seat to see the variety versus him bringing the tray to me. Every time he came to clear my table after each course he apologized by saying sorry (maybe because the service was so poor). At first I though it was b/c of the bread faux pas until I observed him doing it every table. Where was he trained?For one course, the fork prong was twisted and I had to ask for another. My other critique is that at every course he would point his finger at my food almost touching the plate. This is poor etiquette. The other staff are also not paying attention b/c my drinks were delivered to another table not once but twice. It would have been one thing if the place was full, but there were only 7 other tables that were being served. What an aggravating experience. My food was good, and it looked great on the plate. I will also say the head waiter appears to know what he is doing. I also appreciated the bolster pillows and a book to read while I was waiting for each course
2
We stopped for a drink around 5.30pm while in the flower dome and whilst it looked great I completely disagree that for the prices they charge that you have to get up and stand in a queue at the till to place an order and then given a plastic number (there are only 12 tables). Very disappointing although the coffee was good when it arrived (even if in a thimble!). Don't bother and go to the cafe at the main information point outside

We had dinner at Pollen in March. Pollen is located inside the flower dome at Gardens by the Bay. We were not prepared for the cold temperature inside the dome and were wearing clothing better suited to the Singapore climate rather than the 18C inside the dome. Fortunately, the restaurant offers guests a pashmina. We were told that the temperature is controlled to suit the flora inside the dome and will soon be lowered to 16C to suit the Tulips. I did not realise that free entry to the flower dome is included however the dome closes as 9pm so we did not get a chance to have a look around.Aside from the climate, the food was very good. Our Maitre d' was excellent however, we found that a number of staff struggled with English and at times service was a little sporadic when the Maitre d' was occupied and service was left to other staff.We ordered mains and desserts from the a la carte menu. I ordered the Angus Beef short rib which is sous vide for three hours off the bone. It was excellent. My husband enjoyed the Sirloin. We had a summer berry dessert which was impressive for it's special effects (I won't spoil it). I preferred the flavours of my dessert which was the Dulche de Leche (banana and caramel).The complimentary hors d'oeuvres and petit fours were a nice touch and added some interest and adventure to the dining experience.The hotel has spectacular views of the Singapore Flyer and city skyline. Make sure you book ahead as we had difficulty getting a table on a week night. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands. Pollen collected us under the bridge by the river in a golf cart and drove us to the restaurant however it would be a short walk. We walked back to the hotel through Gardens by the Bay which was a lovely way to finish off a very enjoyable meal. This is a lovely choice for a special occasion. Colin the Scottish chef has moved on however the standard of food is still good
2
Whilst visiting the Flower Dome we thought we would stop in and have a hot drink. It was about 9.45am and we were the only ones in the cafe. The hot chocolate and coffee cups were some of the smallest we have ever encountered and our daughters green tea was only luke warm and we had to send it back. Apparently the hot water urn wasn't hot enough yet, well how about boiling the kettle and getting it right the first time. The cost was $30 for 3 drinks
4
First restaurant experience with chauffeur fetching guest to restaurant. Good food and friendly servers. Felt well taken care of.
5
My parents totally enjoyed the experience.
The service was top notch and food was excellent. We had the gourmet set lunch but had several top-ups which was absolutely worth the money.
3
Tried out the restaurant with my partner and we had a pretty decent meal. Nice ambience and ok food. I think the range could be better and the service as well.
4
Good service and good choice of food - not too great on the value for money angle. Staff is good and friendly.
5
Highly recommend! Top service and excellence food.
I will definitely go again in future!
Though it was a but pricy..

Recently went to Pollen to try out the Afternoon Tea. Greeting was pleasant at the main entrance outside, we were then taken upstairs and seated in the Flower Dome part of the restaurant.The restaurant is inside the dome, and Flower Dome guests could walk right up the tables, often coming deep into the restaurant and standing awkwardly right next to our table... this was a little uncomfortable. The tiny sign that said 'sorry the restaurant is closed' did nothing to help. Perhaps they could invest in a rope or small fence so the restaurant boundary is clearly defined.  The food was really tasty and well presented - although the portion was a little small compared to other teas in Singapore.The place also seemed a bit understaffed - but the staff were very pleasant.Free entry to the Flower Dome is included to, so the 40 bucks each price tag is not too bad either.Would we go back? Maybe not... once is enough
3
Made a reservation at pollen because lunch allows for free entry into flower dome. So I highly recommend it if you are thinking about visiting gardens by the bay.The good was nothing to shout about and the service was inconsistent. They try to be a finer dining establishment but they don't pay attention to details. Such as water refills and cutlery replacement. I was a little disappointed as the restaurant brands themselves as Michelin grade (their uk outlet has 1 star
1
We visited the cafe section within the dome. Staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful and the food was not worth the price.There is a very limited menu in the cafe, however they have the restaurant menu available. As we were planning to have lunch I asked about the extended menu and was told firstly that it was the same as the cafe (even though i'd seen it wasn't) and asked again what the difference was. The staff member eventually told me that it was for the restaurant but would not let me take a copy to my mum at the table nearby so we could make a decision whether to eat at the cafe or restaurant.Starving, we decided on a light snack and coffee. For $36.50 we got 2 coffees and a "cheese platter" which consisted of 3 pieces of cheese and 4 crackers. Although the cheese was lovely, 4 crackers and a few slithers of cheese at that price is a joke.When ordering coffee the staff member got the order wrong twice, I finally clarified that I was after a long macchiato and was told that no such thing existed. As it does exist in Australia, I politely tried to explain what I was after as for $6.50 for a coffee I hoped they might be able to meet my request. I was rudely interrupted by the staff member who told me that I knew nothing about coffee and lectured me on what a "real" coffee was.Speaking to a couple of ladies from the UK next to us, they said their experience was similar with the staff member refusing to honour the deal advertised at the entry point. (Although the same staff member was falling over himself to help the young Singaporean woman who entered shortly after.)Thankfully, there was a McDonalds not too far away within the gardens where the customer service was infinitely better

I went there with my boyfriend celebrating our belated Valentine's. I like the atmosphere, unfortunately the complimentary bread was served cold, hard and wasn't crispy on the outside. As a vegetarian-friendly fine dining restaurant, it would be better to have more varieties and choices in the vegetarian menu. Hence average rating for the food.
1
Me and my husband were enjoying a trip around the gardens by the bay when we spotted this place and my husband suggested we have some tea. Being as we have been exploring the city and walking about 20 miles a day we were dressed accordingly in trainers, shorts and my husband in a collared polo shirt and a backpack. Apparently we were not sporting attire that this establishment found acceptable, or they decided we were backpackers and not worth the trouble- either way they skirted past my husband totally ignoring him and seating others behind him in the queue and would not even make eye contact. We are utterly disgusted at this treatment and the judgement passed on us from what we can only assume was our appearance. Never before have we been treated this way, and I hope to never have it happen again as it is a horrible horrible feeling. My husband has previously been into the Armani hotel dressed in exactly the same way and we also visited Raffles and we were treated with complete respect and non judgement. Unfortunately Pollen seems to have visions of grandeur but nothing to back it up. Avoid this pretentious place at all costs.
5
Had a set menu for Valentines Day lunch. Food was 1st class and presented well. Staff were attentive.
3
Limited selection of food.. The desserts were okay but the savoury food catered to very acquired taste as they were Mediterranean. Nothing that i would ask a 2nd serving of. In summary, food doesn't justify the price of $43 each. Would rather pay $20 just to experience the flower dome
1
For a restaurant that holds itself out to be exceptional this was an extremely disappointing meal.i would not expect to be served food of this quality in a street stall let alone an "expensive stylish restaurant " nothing was done when the staff were informed about the poor quality of the food Poor quality poor management
5
The Pollen restaurant is a little hard to find, but well worth the effort for a lunchtime treat. Select their gourmet lunch, accept their shawl to shelter from the freezing air con, and enjoy a visual and tastebud exciting meal. If you do not enjoy their deconstructed desserts, then fine dining is not for you! Afterwards, head upstairs for free entrance to the coolness of the colourful Flower Dome, then you will know why the restaurant is so cold
5
Definitely worth a visit. The food was very tasty. Staff were attentive and knowledgeable. The location was world class. Located in gardens at the bay and looking out onto the Singapore Flyer. Also try and aim to arrive a bit earlier and you can use their free access into the Flower Dome. Visited other restaurants in Singapore which were rated higher but this one definitely came out on top.
1
Approximately 9 arancini with Parmesan and truffle cost 18$. They were very salty and had no discernible flavour of truffle. However the most annoying aspect was the refusal to provide 2 glasses so that we could share a beer [ it was midday and this quantity was quite sufficient at that time]. We were told it had to be served in a special pewter tankard because it was a German wheat beer. I would avoid this place at all costs
4
We decided to go there for our Valentine's day lunch. The restaurant had a buggy service that brings us in to the restaurant from the main gate of GBTB which is very thoughtful. The food were really creative and far beyond our expectations. It was overall a pleasant experience there at Pollen. On a side note, Pollen do have free access for diners into the flower dome if you would like to after the meal.
4
Good ambience, attentive staff, staff is knowledgeable able to recommend wine and food choices. Very thoughtful of them to provide shawl for the ladies as its a little chilly in the restaurant. Good dining experience as we can visit the flower dome as well. Staff is kind enough to offer us entry to the dome on another day. However, the food was abit of a let down especially for the price we were paying. Although the beef short rib was nicely cooked, it had too much fats. The Iberico pork was very hard to cut into so it would be nice if slices were served instead of chunks
4
Lovely fine dining experience. Stunning location, Complimentary buggy transfer from the carpark through the Gardens by the Bay to the restaurant and back again. We strolled through the Flower Dome virtually on our own while our meal was being prepared. Not a place to go if you are on a budget. Our bill worked out at about Â£100 per head.
5
Stopped here by chance when we visited the Gardens by the Bay and were lucky to step in just as someone cancelled their reservation for afternoon tea, which means we were able to have it. Absolutely everything on the menu was delicious, amazing combinations of different flavours. We had raffles afternoon tea the next day and can honestly say that it did not compare. Would recommend to anyone looking for afternoon tea in Singapore and would be back here in an instant if we visited again!
5
Excellent service, great food, wonderful ambience. Highly recommend. The buggy ride and access to the Flower Dome sealed the deal.
5
Food was really good and definitely worth a revisit! Being situated in the flower dome, the restaurant is filled with the floral fragrance of the blooming flowers.
4
We went to the cafe upstairs for a quick tea.
It was excellent. Service was fast and the view was great. Staff were courteous and helpful. Afterward, a nice stroll in the flower dome.
3
Expected better tasting food from an expensive place like Pollen, sadly even TCC high tea is much better.
4
Atmosphere is good, staffs are also friendly.
After high tea,can access to flower dome. Will recommend friends to go.
5
Everything was good, from the pick up on arrival at the Gardens entrance, the service, the ambience, the food. Couldn't fault it, will definitely be back!
1
Went to the side café, the place has nice food from what I remembered from my last visit. Still, you need to order at the counter and pay before you get served and I paid 9S$ for still water and got a carafe of filtered water! When enquired with the waiter, showed him the order as paid, he told us this is what it is. I still can not believe it! A first in my life, I the many places and countries I visited.
3
Had lunch on a Sunday where 2 of us went ala carte and the other 2 went for the set 3 course lunch menu. Lovely & cool environment as it was scorching outside. However, I can imagine ppl feeling a bit cold if you are not used to cool weather. Service was attentive and I have nothing but praise for the waiting team. Set menu - 3 options for each course including a vegetarian course. The starter options looked interesting but the main courses appeared standard. Ala carte - 6-7 options for both starters & mains, with an additional steak menu with 4 different cuts of meat.Starters - the beef tartar whilst fresh could do with more seasoning; the beetroot & goats cheese salad, tasted ok and was colorful to the eye; the raw scallops with pickled vegetables were fresh but once again could do with more seasoning.Mains - beef back rib was flavorsome but could be a little more tender; the Iberian pork had the expected flavour profile but was a bit dry; the duck in carrot jus was fine & the main fish course, whilst generally tasty, unfortunately was slightly undercooked in places.Desserts - were interesting but unfortunately, the description and appearance of all 4 desserts were better than the taste. We had a lovely time catching up with family but unfortunately, the food, whilst OK, did not enhance the day
5
I was a bit uncertain based on reviews but I had a flawless experience. The set lunch menu was a good deal for three courses. Each was unique and delicious. I started with the beetroot because I didn't like the sound of any of the starters and was surprised I really liked it! I hate beets but the beetroot was not bitter and the goat cheese moose delicious. I would recommend offering something that isn't raw among the starters as we aren't all into raw but this one was better than expected. I should add the bread service was very nice as well. I had the duck for a main course and it was delicious. The jus was flavorful and the carrot purée yummy. The nuts and seeds that were a garnish added a surprising compliment. I chose the berries for dessert which came with a small scoop of ice cream and I enjoyed that as well. Service was pretty perfect the day I visited. Really enjoyed it and the gardens are beautiful so Pollen is a lovely compliment.
3
Nice ambience and decent service, but not fantastic food quality given the hyped profile of the restaurant. Air con is very cold, so it is good to bring an extra scarf or jacket. Error in billing and we were charged for an extra bottle of still water
5
the service was excellent. the staff had deep knowledge of the menu and were very attentive. the food was generally very but the steak was below our expectations. nevertheless, we had a good time!
1
I had high expectations since it was a famous restaurant. I was completely underwhemed.
My complaints:
- Very slow service (does not match to the normal Singapore level of service)
- Mediocre food, too salty
- Expensive
4
The food was ok. The service was excellent, love the buggy service. My average rating is based on the food. Good but not worth making the entire trip for.
4
Everything was fine, the service, the environment, etc. just the food was a bit too 'contemporary' that we don't appreciate that much the taste
3
Great location but service was amateurish and sloppy. Manager dripped food on my trousers and was less than apologetic. When I asked for soda water to remove the stain, I was offered a cloth with plain water!My wife was allergic to nuts and cinnamon but the desert came with cinnamon! Manager denied it but when we questioned the pastry chef, she said she had added a pinch of cinnamon! No apologies!Disappointed indeed

Pollen is the younger brother of Pollen Street Social in London, the Michelin-starred brainchild of culinary alchemist Jason Atherton. This is as impeccably elegant and sophisticated a restaurant as you will find. I was equally impressed with the feel of the place and the front-desk welcome.The main action, however, is in the open-plan dining room, one whose design is confident, with natural light, huge mirrors on the wall of one side and greenery outside. It’s not every day you can give a restaurant five stars for design and atmosphere, but Pollen’s intimately romantic room is irresistible.The dishes were sublime. There were no low points – only a competing series of highlights. The masterly BBQ Iberico pork presa, baby leek, chicory, apple, sage polenta was a beautiful sight. The delicious subtlety and artistry butternut and saffron risotto, sunflower seeds, honey croutons, aged parmesan and the Angus beef short rib, celeriac, truffle potato, caramelized onions, too, looked just as gorgeous.Pollen is simply brilliant. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
5
Service is excellent, starts from the buggy ride up to the end of the meal. Very friendly staff, patient and super attentive! Usually fancy food with little portion like this could be beautiful visually but not yummy, but every food at Pollen is just ridiculously delicious and experimental. Every bites is a positive experience and the taste is layered and new (something you hv never tasted before!).Complimentary to flower dome was great as we got to walk and smell the roses in the dome! Super awesome
5
Best overall dining experience so far in Singapore. I arrived 2 hours before the scheduled dinner time as there is free access to the flower dome. Loved the buggy ride from MBS to the flower dome. Dinner at Pollen is perfect after a stroll around the garden. Service was attentive and meticulous (lovely shawls for the ladies). Had the Salmon for main dish on top of the some appetizers (including the complimentaries). Ingredients used are harmonious with the Salmon. Ended the night perfectly with a cocktail.
4
My friend took me here for my birthday. She lives in Singapore now and missed out on the celebrations with all of our friends back home so wanted to take me somewhere nice.Well it was lovely to get into the air conditioning for the heat outside.The service was attentive, wine list not bad. The food was ok but not memorable.I don't know the overall price as my friend paid but she said it was one of the most Exe meals she has had in Singapore. We did have a few very nice wines which would have added to the cost.Overall a nice lunch but a once only
5
Stopped for lunch at the restaurant after a walk around the botanical gardens. Very good ambience with very good and courteous staff. Ordered variety of food ,the preparations were very authentic n good . A bit expensive but worth every penny.. Will visit again if Singapor
3
We booked afternoon tea and the setting is beautiful and the food is good but sadly it was a pretty underwhelming experience due to the poor, slow service and underwhelming cocktails. I was really looking forward this restaurant and I felt let down.
5
The food was fantastic. The combination of flavors was surprisingly delectable. Enjoyment in every bite.
2
Expected more from a renowned restaurant. Incredibly slow service for such a small space. Had to remind them to get my drink which is just sitting on the counter.
4
Everything was awesome thank you for the awesome birthday dinner experience.. Great food great staff great ambience
5
Went there with my parents. We had festive set lunch. The food is nice and special. Service is very good.

We had high tea, manager was extremely attentive and the service staff brought a more comfortable chair and extra pillows for my pregnant wife. Food was great, pricing was good. Don't forget that access to Flower Dome is complimentary! They even have a buggy service from the main entrance of Gardens by the Bay to the restaurant. Would definitely come back

As fans of London's Pollen Street Social my wife and I were keen to visit the Singaporean sister restaurant. As it was New Year's Eve the restaurant was fully booked for lunch but we were able to sit upstairs in the Terrace which is part of the amazing Gardens by the Bay. The service and standard of the tapas style food was impeccable - particularly from Yan whose knowledge of the wine and menu was excellent and put us at ease. Yan even ensured that we avoided being caught in a torrential downpour on leaving the venue - a gesture that was so appreciated and was the perfect final touch to a lovely lunch to end 2015
5
The overall experience was a perfect one.From the moment we stepped in, the waiters were very helpful and attended to our needs immediately. Service was top-notched.Food was of good standard and value for money.Also it was comfortable to be seated near the glass panel area where we can admire some plants nearby. Will be back for more in future
4
The service staff was excellent and attentive. They were great in their recommendation. Food was excellent except the risotto which was under cooked. They asked for my feedback and when I told them about it, they waived off the charges for the risotto which was not expected
5
Everything perfect 1. Food - We had the vegetarian dinner taste menu - the pumpkin gnocchi and the risotto are fighting for the first place. 2. Service - Perfect timing, wine selection perfectly matching the dishes, very attentive3. Ambience - enjoy the flower dome while dining. Don't forget the winter clothes. It's cold in Singapore's inside season.An evening to remember, worth the money
5
Consistently the Best... Every single visit, the past 3yrs. Great food, amazing service, superb staff.
3
Freezing room, no offer of wraps though available had to ask & 1 course inedible. Wait staff slightly off hand and kept changing
2
The service is poor and the food was just ok! very small portions and very expencive. Fish and chips SD$ was 28.00 and a Gingerale was SD$ 9.00
5
Celebrated our first wedding anniversary there and I must comment that the staff were very warm and attentive. Explaining the dishes and helped in making our anniversary dinner an unforgettable event.

We took our daughter to Pollen to celebrate her 21st birthday. Going for dinner at Gardens By The Bay is a wonderful experience amidst magical surroundings. We're glad we arrived before it got dark as we were able to see part of the Gardens via golf buggy as it took us from the pickup point to the Flower Dome. We got to walk around the Flower Dome before dinner. The design and layout of the restaurant is truly unique and comfortable. It felt really airy and open even though we were in air-conditioned surroundings. The staff were really well-trained and knowledgeable. They seemed able to anticipate our every need. The menu and drink list is quite complete without being too huge or confusing. Overall, it was a truly memorable evening and we're glad we were able to give our daughter an evening she enjoyed and remembers dearly
5
While adventuring through the flower dome we stumbled across this tucked away cafe! At first thinking it was a mere kiosk style cafe we admired the crowded restraunt and feasted our eyes on some unbelievable looking "afternoon tea sets" so we found a table and ordered the bombe Alaska and a Belgium chocolate cake. Both were very beautiful looking and tasted heavenly
5
We came here for a small gathering with friends. And we really loved the whole place, enjoying tea as we enjoyed the lovely scent of the floral garden. The food was fantastic! My friends who came back from overseas commented that it was good too! Service was average. They forgot to inform us that last order must be placed by 4.30pm. Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves.Do sit on level two! The view (and the feel) is better
5
We booked in advance did a late dinner, but finished our wander through the Cloud Forest earlier than anticipated and the restaurant wasn't quite open. It wasn't a problem for the staff though, they simply adjusted our booking to be two hours earlier and sat us up on the terrace for some drinks while we waited. Dinner itself was a wonderful (but expensive) experience. The attention to detail blew me away - as a vegan I find it very rare that I will be given more than one option per course. To be given two options for starter and main was amazing! Very very happy with our experience here, worth every penny
4
we often come here for family celebration, may it be kids birthdays or welcoming foreign guests.access to the gardens is the major reasonservice is excellentstaff are warm n frdly esp towards kidsfood is average n perhaps overpricedthat is however compensated by the surrounding ambienceT

As most of the ppl commented, the food(casual terrace instead of fine dining) was on the expensive side. With fish and chips cost $34 and steak cost $40. I have to say the food we ordered were pretty delicious. But their service needs to be improved for such a lovely location. We called to book a table for fine dining yet it was fully booked already for that day. The staff recommended us for the casual one instead at the terrace. We asked to reserve a table yet the staff said should have many tables, just walk in. So we reached there at 6pm. Nobody greeted us at the entrance. We called the waitress and she asked us to come back at 7pm without asking our name and contact number.We're unhappy so we talked to another staff and told him that we don't want to come back again and again without reserving a table. He then allowed us to walk in. We don't feel welcomed and the worst is we asked for tartar sauce twice from different waiters but wasn't served till we finished our meals.
5
Stopped here for a drink and a snack. An amazing place and far far better than expected. Small but beautifully formed !

Singapore has some fantastic restaurants. Unfortunately, Pollen isn't one of them. Our linguini was too al dente and the fries were cold. As we left, our waitress asked us how we enjoyed the meal. I told her about the fries and she suggested that the fries were cold because the room was cold... We paid $102 SGD for two entrees, drinks (one juice, one soda and two coffees), and side of fries. For that price, equivalent to about $72 USD, we have had truly delicious meals for two at other restaurants in Singapore, such as Boca. The portions at Pollen were quite small too. As part of the Gardens By the Bay, Pollen should be an exemplary dining experience, but it is a disappointingly mediocre component of an otherwise fulfilling Singaporean attraction
3
Our boss took the group for lunch and we were served the festive menu 3 course set lunch.Slow pace serving and dishes are rather small. Good for small eaters. Unable to fill our team and some need to look for more food thereafter.The only consolation is we get free entry into the flower dome and you can do it before or after your meal. May go back and try their ala carte meal after the festive season
5
The service staff was very attentive. When one of them saw my Father huddling himself, he brought us scarfs immediately. While ordering I did not know that the beef tartar for starters was to be served raw. The waiter alerted us immediately, I guess when looking at the age of my Father he understood that it does not seem appropriate. Every dish was explained very carefully when presented. I enjoyed the experience there and was glad I went. Thank you
5
Set amongst the beautiful Gardens by the Bay, this restaurant is a holiday at home! The Exec Chef, Colin, comes out and speaks about his stunning food with the customers. He's so passionate and proud of his signature menu, and he deserves to be! When the Michelin Guide comes to Singapore Pollen will be up the top! Beautiful setting, deliciously glamorous food & divine wines. A must visit in Singapore, particularly for a long lunch with friends or family.
4
It was a nice place right below the dome. They can send a buggie nee the ticketing counter of the gardens by the bay but it's not too far actually. Food had amazing mix of tastes, sweet n sour, spicy n fruity.. Varied colours as well. Small portions but well presented. The place is s bit too cold with inside temperature of 16 degrees as it is below the dome. Do ask for a pashmina shawl and they will provide you with one. What's more you also get a free access to the dome if you have lunch there.
5
The best place to have your lunch, afternoon tea or dinner, with trees and flowers all over! Tried their afternoon tea set, not bad, not bad at all! The cakes felt a little dry, but the savoury and scones are tasty! However it does get a little cold, so do bring along a jacket just in case. Overall, a great experience. Would love to come back again
4
Was a backup option for a reservation somewhere else that didn't work out but everyone totally enjoyed themselves. Being inside the climate controlled flower dome also makes it feel like one's dining al fresco in the autumn. Had the extra benefit of being able to pop in to see the Christmas decorations before dinner.Only hesitation with going back is the pricing - we skipped the set menu and went a la carte but it still ended up being $1,500 for 7 of us
3
We attended high tea, started 3pm ended about 5pm. Highlights was the ambience, super cool like on a mountain with flowers and trees all around and being December - Christmas was in the air with nice smells. What turned us off is that we had no food or drink till almost 3.30pm They had enough waiters around, but seemed a little disorganized. What was good is the free flow of any beverage , for us was Long Black and Cappuccino , almost 3-4 rounds The high tea was fixed, mostly sweets which was not good for a diabetic like me, but the Parma Ham and Croissants were very nice, wished I had free flow of Parma Ham Another plus point, they had a special cake for me with lovely taste and display Just wished we had better service, then we would have had a better experience and might come back again
4
We took some of our friends from out of town for high tea at Pollen. The Pollen shuttle was excellent - on time and very comfortable. We had reservations for 4 people but ended up coming with 5 people instead. The staff very kindly did not make an issue of it. Unfortunately, we had sat down for a good 15 minutes but had not been served. I went to the counter to order whereby we were told that our orders would be taken at our table because we were there for high tea. The food was excellent - great quality and large portion sizes. The wait staff were super friendly and helpful. They even played with my 6 month old daughter. The only thing I would change was - it was a lot chillier than we expected but we were not offered shawls until we were paying to leave! All in all - a great experience. We will definitely be coming back.
5
We had lunch after visiting Flower Dome . It is bit expensive but service and food is excellent. The Prawn Dim sum were delicious and must visit place.
5
The food was excellent, a cut above the rest. The service was also top notch. I left sated and happy. The wine was merely decent, but then again, it's difficult to get good wine for a reasonable price in Singapore.
4
Great restaurant in a spetacular venue inside the Flower Dome at the Gardens by the Bay. The food is delicious, the service is very nice. They also have a creative dessert experience.
5
Food was fantastic and service was fast (very unusual for Singapore!). We arrived early and so were given the opportunity to walk around the indoor gardens - staff provided complimentary pashmina. Dinner Tasting Menu is recommended for the best experience.
4
The free buggy ride was an experience in itself and very thoughtful. The restaurant ambience is great! I like the details even down to the bill (which comes in a decorated box) makes the whole experience worthwhile. Hard to find fine dining which accommodates toddlers. The free entrance to the flower dome adds more activity after your meal. The only downside is the food quality. My wife's poached salmon was too salty. I loved the Angus baby ribs!!
5
After 2 weeks in Vietnam and with stopover in Singapore my wife and I decided to go a bit upscale for our final dinner of our holidays. WE booked at Pollen as we had heard good things and had not been there before on our previous visits to Singapore. We had the Dinner Tasting menu and it was fabulous. we have been to 3 star Michelin restaurants in Europe and have eaten at variety of differing eateries over the years. Polls was sensational, the service was brilliant, the prices were appropriate and value for money for what we were eating. The variety and quality of the food is exceptional and we will definitely be going back on our next Singapore visit. Thank you to the staff at Pollen a great night - highly recommen
5
We went to Pollen for a special family celebration and were extremely pleased with the service, atmosphere and the food. We ate the vegetarian tasting menu which was creative and delicious. They offered a few dishes for children that were not on the menu and which our kids loved. The wine pairings were very good and the sommelier did a fantastic job describing them. The wine complemented the food perfectly. They also had some tasty craft cocktails on the menu. The service was impeccable and setting inside the Flower Dome was beautiful. We will definitely be back.
5
Reservation made a day before for a lunch.It was hot to walk there from the mrt station as we couldn't locate the free buggy service. But it cool us don't win within a minutes enter the restaurant. First time visit and Pollen did WOW us with to quality of food and service that we experience. We were seated at the window seating. View was great lighting and ambience was just nice comfort and cozy. After seated the sommeliers offer us with a trolley of champagne and sparkling wines. I still had my favorite San pellegrino first.We ordered 2 sets of lunch.First was the bread they served. It is nicely mand and petite with a baked and a steamed version. The sour dough break with mustard butter and hummus in jar is my favorite. I ate 3 loaf of that sourdough. First course was trout, the presentation was great with the addition of cucumber juice icing it enhance the dining experience to the next level. Followed by the main which is barramundi that I ordered, it was nicely done. Pork belly was heavenly great. Dessert was perfect. Portion was good. Presentation was perfect and the taste was great. Service was unbeatable from the moment we entered the restaurant. We were constantly being ask about the course and I do not have to refil my sparkling water myself. Servers also explain all the ingredient and the dishes served.Top service and great gastronomy experience
2
Everything was Not Quite Right! Service is average, food write up looks good but execution and taste is average. Ambiance is OK however you can hear the table next doors conversation. Some people dress up and others are in flip flops for dinner. Restaurant is positioning itself as fine dining but not at all delivering fine dining experience, taste or service. Don't spend your hard earned money here, there are other restaurants that deliver mor
5
This isn't the cheapest place to eat in Singapore, but the service is spectacular and the culinary creations are a bit on the unique side. You need to come here expecting what I call "European portion" sizes and some cuisine flexibility.One key thing to remember - you can visit the Flower Dome for free afterwards, so you won't need to buy a separate admission fee for that. They will let you use the elevator to get up there and then you are free to wander as you wish
5
I brought a fren who is a florist in her own hometown and she had the most incredible experience ever. The place could not be more apt. Kudos to the staff, chef and backroom staff.
3
The food is ok, but the sources are far too sweet. The service should inform the dinning guest there are complementary dessert, so there is no wastage.
5
A very awesome place indeed. I would definitely visit again in the future. I just love th3 atmosphere there.
5
My husband and I had a great night, great ambiance and the food was delicious. Plus they run a little buggy that pics you up from tower 3.
5
I love the foods and the environment. Just found out I can get free entrance to Flowers Dome when I dine in, too bad, the waiter only let me know on my second trip.
4
First and foremost, food was a 8.5-9 out of 10. I'm vegetarian/pescetarian, my partner is not. We got tasty "complementary" bread and starters (both regular and vegetarian options). Our mains were the risotto and salmon with gnocchi dishes. I wasn't a huge fan of the risotto sauce but my partner liked it, we both thought the salmon/gnocchi was pretty amazing. It was his birthday so they let me reserve a half price ($10 instead of normal $20 for other desserts) cake with writing, I got the carrot cake which was probably the best I've tasted. The other chocolate dessert dish we got was pretty good but not as mind-blowing. Finally, the two cocktails we got were decent, definitely unique.Service is very proper (which actually makes me a little uncomfortable, like, really, it's okay if you talk to me like a normal human being). Atmosphere is nice, both patrons and employees seemed to be in good spirits.Overall, I'd probably come back on very special occasions. The first time I've spent $215 for a two-person meal, and at that price I'd expect something amazing. If only it was more in the $150 range (and minus some of the really unnecessary things, like the unpriced glass of champagne offered as you sit down, followed by the cart with aforementioned champagne parked right in front of the table just in case you change your mind), I could maybe justify visiting more than just once a year for a birthday.Just wanted to give one final word to other vegetarians, just mention it to your waiter/waitress, they will bring you a separate menu, it has the a la carte options (that are on the main menu but not identified as veg-friendly, I think it was two starters and two mains) and there's even a vegetarian tasting menu (at $130, including wine).

Pollen is located inside the Flower Dome at Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Your booking includes admission in the Flower Dome, which is amazing to see. The restaurant is on two levels, a main dining room and an upper level lounge that connects with the Flower Dome, a nice venue for lunch or afternoon tea. The booking also includes a golf cart transfer from the Gardens Visitors Centre to the restaurant, which is worth it given the heat. Note that Pollen will even pick you up from the alternate parking areas, such as the Meadow, if you call as ask, as evening activities and visitors can fill the prime parking garage. I have been to Pollen twice now, and while the venue and service are outstanding, I come away disappointed with the food. There are some very creative items on the menu, but the final presentation and the overall experience leaves me thinking that it is ordinary and does not impress me as outstanding. I had the fois gras terrine; it is predictable but not outstanding. My daughter had the scallops; very tasty but it was a lot of raw scallops to eat; best shared. My wife, who is vegetarian, had the potato starter, and honestly that was the best of the three starters. For the main I ordered the pork; the server advised me that it comes out pink in the center. I asked her if they could cook it more done, and she said it would be tough. I said I thought she was perhaps advising against the pork and she nodded, so I went for the sirlon instead. What I got was a rather fatty and grisly piece of beef; I would not recommend it for that price. It came with an excellent salad, and french fries cooked in duck fat. I was not impressed with the fries, they were a bit tough-skinned. My wife had the cauliflower side, which was disappointing. My daughter had the salmon and was pleased with her dish. My wife had the John Dory fish and was also pleased. We had two desserts: the chocolate creme with nuts and then my wife was having a birthday and received a small slice of chocolate cake. We decided that dessert was not a point of excellence at Pollen. As I mentioned, the service was excellent, especially for Singapore, and the staff was really trying hard in my observation. My final remarks, the restaurant has no dress code; I don't like to be dressed nicely in an expensive restaurant only to see other customers so casually in shorts. Our neighbourhood pizza restaurant does not accept patrons in shorts so surprised Pollen is so casual. Finally, if I am paying that much for a meal and drink, I appreciate a table cloth rather than a bare wood veneer

i don't usually go for fine dining however as I was around Gardens by the Bay with mum, thought I'd give this a go seeing how popular I heard it was. I had no regrets at all. From the raw scallops starter to the simple canapes of bread and steamed mini buns, everything was scrumptious! They even provided complementary desserts which one of them blew me away - a simple cassis (blackcurrant) marshmallows which was bursting with flavour. Fantastic place would totally recommend be it with family or as a romantic dinner for tw
5
In the lower of the flower domes the pollen restaurants have a terrace cafe, benefiting from the perfect climate of the dome and the sheer beauty of the exhibition.The food is tapas-like with excellent raw materials and big enough for two people sharing two or three. The wine list is impressive!The ambience is great, food and wine is great, - what else would you want
5
My husband chose this restaurant as our 2nd wedding anniversary location. The food was exquisite and original, I had the most amazing risotto IÂ´d ever had. The place is very nice cause you have access to the Flower Dome where you may start your first glass of wine. There was a great variety of wines, specially fragant ones from Chile and France. The service was excellent and by the end of this "dinner - experience", the staff arrived with a beautiful cake slice to greet us for our wedding. I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic date or for a quite and deilghtful dinner with friends. I will definetelly go back
4
Excellent food and great location. Staff were amazing and accommodated very well. Food and wine again excellent - highly recommend and with complementary entry into the gardens - this is an extra special treat - so leave some time to have a look a round.
5
Very nice Environment and food was good but very expensive. Dinner for 4 pax averages @ S$120 per pax.
4
Housed in our beautiful Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, Pollen is a great place for a special date. Food was very good. Hokkaido scallops, beef short ribs, Dory with cockles and you must leave space for their Apple Tartin!!!
5
A beautiful setting for a brief rest break and refreshments when visiting the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay. The food was excellent, service was great, and the setting was magnificent.
5
The lady at the counter took us to look into the kitchen. It was a good experience and waiter who I don't remember his name was greatly kind to us too.
5
I would have never discovered this place on my own! This restaurant is located on the ground level of Marina Bay's Flower Dome facing the city. You get a nice view over the Bay including people strolling and jogging by. We were there for lunch and I can only imagine that this must be a gorgeous sight at night. The interior is modern but does not strike any particular note.Food-wise, Pollen is definitely for the finer palate. Portions are exquisite and small, and the baramundi I had was outstanding. Wines are an equal match. All in all a highly cultured culinary experience but do not go there if you are really hungry, and do not visit if your budget is running low
2
My friends and I were recently there to celebrate a birthday. The food was good, portions were a tad small (but I would expect this for fine dining). The shocker for me was how the waiter continuously popped open bottles of still water without telling us or us asking for it. (We ordered one but they subsequently popped 2 more.) A surprise birthday cake was previously preordered but when we asked for the cake to be served, the staff handed us the dessert menu without us asking for it. This definitely ruined the surprise. Knowing that we paid a premium for this place, the finer details matter and it seems to me that Pollen is more keen on overcharging than ensuring that their guests have a wonderful experience unlike that at somewhere else in the same price range - Morton's. I wouldn't recommend this place.
5
The Pollen experience was sensational, one of the best, lightest most flavourful dinners I have ever eaten!Tucked away in the lower level of the Flower Dome in the Gardens by the Bay complex in Singapore, you secure not only a table, but a free walk around the Dome and shuttle buggy back to the MRT station, via the Supertree Grove on a smoggy smoke filled night (thanks Indonesia, not!).The dining experience was sublime.Starting with the canapés, mixed little delicacies with the beetroot macaron filled with chèvre was a hit.The star was the Beetroot inspired entrée, with jelly, yoghurt and frozen Beetroot ice adding a smoking experience!The main was a lush just cooked fillet of Norwegian salmon poached in jasmine tea, truffle gnocchi and burnt butter!Both were enjoyed with a glass of Clot d'Encis Rose, St Josep Terra Alta 2013. Dessert was prepared at the Dessert bar, poached pears, chamomile, ginger, granita and yoghurt with a 2011 Dr Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese. The petit fours exploded with flavour, of coconut, passionfruit and bitter chocolate.After dinner, I was shown around the kitchen and chatted to the sous chef running a very polished humming operation.Overall a superb dining experience from Mr Atherton and a fabulous addition to the great vibrant dining scene in Singapore
4
Long day exploring the gardens & wanted a late lunch. Decided on tapas, & every dish was fantastic! 4 small dishes was plenty for 2 ... Squid with Harissa is great, grilled chorizo full of flavour, & olive / feta mix lite. Our soda's also a pleasant surprise, especially my "refresh" with passion fruit & elderflower. If at the gardens, seek out The Terrace at Pollen

This is a beautiful restaurant located in the main pavilion at Gardens by the Bay. The food was outstanding, the service professional, and the extras made the evening perfect.My daughter is allergic to dairy proteins. We were asked about any dietary requirements for dislikes when we arrived. They provided her with wonderful menu choices which were fully explained. She was given special preparations at each point in the meal and never felt that she was compromising her dining experience. These were not non-dairy versions of the standard fare, but distinct and interesting choices. Because of the location, it is important to keep the restaurant cool to combat the humidity from the gardens above. Patrons are offered lovely pashimas to wear during the meal and it was exactly what was needed. Guests are given the opportunity to visit the gardens upstairs between courses. Guests are also invited to tour the kitchen and speak to the chef following the meal. When we were ready to leave, the hostess suggested that she call us a buggy to take us to the taxi stand. It was a pretty drive along the bay and a perfect way to end the evening
3
The food was good, even though it took too long to get it.
Total absense of a city view was a bit of a disapointment.
Ok to go once in a lifetime to tick the box.
5
Within the botanical gardens, a great venue for dinner (with a shuttle from the entrance of the gardens!). We were able to also visit the Flower Dome and see beautiful chrysanthemums. The food was great.
4
Good food and great service. Friendly and personable chef. I appreciated having a separate vegetarian menu too! Overall very good although quite pricey.
5
Excellent service and top quality food. The service was very sincere and the kitchen staffs and the chefs were very welcoming as well.
1
Mortgage your house if you decide to par take in 1 beer and 1 soft drink. ( $28)
Service was very, very slow.
5
My first visit and it will definitely not be the last. I decided to have lunch as I spotted my favourite Hake on the menu. The fish was replaced by Ling which was beautifully done and I discovered a new favourite fish. Attentive service team and excellent food. Restaurant can be quite cold as we are in the flower dome.
3
This was my 4th time patronizing Pollen. My first three times was fantastic. However, I can't say the same for my forth time. They have changed all the staff except for the host. The new staff lacks training and experience. They look very young and mostly from Taiwan. I believe that this affected the overall experience as it was difficult to understand when they were explaining the dishes.My family and I had the set lunch menu. There were some hits and misses. I noticed that the chef had a lot of curry inspiration and never fails on the presentation.Another let down of the day was my main, which was suppose to the Ling but was replaced with barramundi. I still opted for the fish main as it caught my eye in terms of the complexity and interesting choice of flavours. Sadly, half way thru my main, I realised that my fish was uncooked. I cut thru the fish and it was transparent instead of a white smooth silky finish. I informed the staff of the uncooked fish. After a few minutes, the staff came back informing that the chef insisted the fish was meant to be served in that way but offered to replace me with a new fish main. My replacement was cooked to perfection. Slightly brown, thin crisp sealing the soft sweet fish meat with white smooth silkiness. I believe that the staff should handle the situation better by apologising or even opted for better choices of words. I hope Pollen will emphasis on customer service training for their staff
5
Had a wonderful meal for my mums birthday, food was excellent & we were made to feel very special! Lovely venue, even offered a shawl incase you were cold with the temperature of the conservatory. Meeting the chef was an added bonus & an experience we will never forget! Can't thank Pollen enough! Highly recommend coming here :)

My wife and I attended a wine pairing dinner with my favorite wines from Ata Rangi, New Zealand. The wine maker Clive and his wife Phyll joined the evening and that enhanced the experience. Both Clive & Phyll were very kind and we enjoyed our conversations about wine choices and getting advice on our wine order.The food was good backed with attentive service. I did not much appreciate the canapes and starter but the salmon and duck were exquisite. It's expensive but then that is how it is with fine dining in Singapore.It was cold and the staff offered my wife a pashmina wrap, which she much appreciated. The staff were also kind to offer us a buggy ride to the Marina Bay hotel area. A great experience
5
I will review this restaurant based on my food. (My Mrs wasn't overly impressed with the risotto but thats her view and it can go in her review no doubt)Firstly its a great venue, we went the day after the Formula 1 and it was rather quiet but it was monday so can be forgiven. However the restaurant looks out of the dome onto the singapore flyer, nice inside and out.Staff were REALLY good, offering the good lady a pashmina as the dome temperature is quite low, and with no one in the restaurant this was noticeably chilly. Good knowledge of the menu, offers to take us upstairs to look in the Dome even thought it was shut, and friendly overall manner made it a good experience.I had the pigeon for mains but first there were amuse bouche of savoury macaroons and cheese "dumplings". Very tasty.Pigeon breast, stuffed legs, figs, citrus gel, sprout leaves, and more. Cooked really well. Tasty. Great stuff. Presented him smoking on hay and rosemary before preparing him for the plate. nice touch.Wine is VERY expensive, but it is Singapore so what to do......Desert was had. It was deconstructed something but i was quite drunk and cant remember exaclty what the dish was. Good though.Then more free nibbles, including some marshmallows which we top notch.Overall really good. More people would be great. Book ahead and go at the weekend. I imagine it would be really buzzing with atmosphere to match the venue and food
4
The people there are friendly and with smiles! Good service, great food. Get free access to the flower dome before the food is served!
5
It has great service and ambience but the sweetness. It's a good place to relax along the floral and fauna. Afternoon tea is great
5
Romantic atmosphere, the walk in the flower dome really helped build up a comfortable mood of serenity. The food was well balanced with flavours and textures, one of the best restaurants I've dined at.Servers were diligent and alert, there was no need to cue for assistance.Definitely will recommend Pollen and will visit again
3
Didn't rate pollen at all. Ive eaten in many of Singapore's top restaurants and there are far better than this. Food was just ok. Except for my starter of caramel potatoe something which was basically just a jacket potato! Huge portion for starter too. Mains were quite nice and quite cutting edge food. Service was dire. Wine list was so limited. They have basically sourced all no name wines and increased the prices so you have no idea if its value or not. Unknown regions so wine connoisseurs you wont be impressed.The 2 we had were just not good enough. No sommelier or any advice from staff when they have such strange wine list.Restaurant is freezing as its the same air conditioning as the dome. They come around with pashminas for ladies.Cocktails upstairs in bar were amazing. A lovely start to the evening.Final insult was all the staff smoking out the front of the entrance when we left!!
5
We chose this restaurant for a small family reunion, hoping for a nice atmosphere and excellent food. What we got was so much more, buggy service from taxi drop off to restaurant offers a nice view of Gardens by the Bay and creates an expectation of special things to come.We had 3 appetizers and 4 mains, outstanding dish for us was a humble potato elevated to find dining with goats cheese and mint sauce. Main star for waguy beef onglet and angus beef short ribs. Food was so rich, we have not had enough space for desserts, need to come back soon.To the restaurant owner: please use table clothes, it will make big difference
5
If you are looking for an elegant, delicious dining experience in Singapore, I would strongly recommend Pollen, located in the flower dome at Gardens by the Bay. We found it by chance as we were visiting the gardens and stopped here for lunch, but if we had had more time in Singapore, we would have definitely come back for dinner. The dining room is fairly minimalist in dÃ©cor, with glass walls looking out at green gardens. The restaurant is actually part of the flower dome, and therefore the temperature is rather chilly due to the air conditioning for the dome, so bring a sweater. But it is not so cold as to be uncomfortable if your arms are covered. The staff are all very welcoming and quietly gracious, setting the scene for a most relaxing meal.We chose from the a la carte lunch menu, and while I don't recall every dish we had, I recall that the foie gras terrine was one of the smoothest, creamiest I have ever had (my only complaint being that I wish we had not shared as I could have eaten it all myself), the short ribs with potato puree (unctuous, tender), and the duck fat chips (fries). We also shared a warm apple tatin (huge) with vanilla ice cream, so good we regretted not being able to finish it all. Coffee and complimentary small sweet bites concluded the meal.After lunch, a staff member escorted us up to the flower dome - the admission fee for the flower dome is waived if you dine at Pollen.I would highly recommend Pollen if you are looking for understated elegance and amazing food

My girlfriend and I had the tasting menu. Food was very high quality. Interesting menu items like beetroot jelly with chestnut cream; salmon cooked sous vide. The beef short ribs were so tender and juicy.The restaurant staff were extremely attentive, friendly and approachable. They were knowledgeable of the food being served. They even engaged in light conversation in between courses. After dinner, we were even invited to take a look at their kitchen and speak to the sous chef. Great guy, explaining the food menu and the concept behind the restaurant.Two other things I liked very much: They provided (i) complimentary pick up from the Gardens by the Bay Car Park (via buggy), and (ii) free entry to the Flower Dome. We had some time to walk within the Dome after we enjoyed our dinner.Overall, an extremely enjoyable experience

If you intent to visit the Flower Dome at Garden by the Bay, suggest to have lunch or tea break at Pollen and at the same time, you can get a free access to the Flower Dome. 3 courses set lunch is at $55 (starter + main course + dessert), coffee / tea at additional $5. For small eater, the portion is just right, as for big eater, maybe you can whack more fresh piping hot bread (serve with mustard / butter). The menu is slightly different compare to few months ago I came. This month there is no soup as starter, so I had raw salmon salad, hake as main course and strawberry dessert. Those who drives, you may park your car at the Garden by the Bay carpark, the pick-up point for the diners at Pollen is near the taxi stand (there is a sign board). Give a try, but don't expect toooo much on the food (is slightly above average only)...you wont regret with the ambience and the free access to the flower dome ( one stone kills many birds)

We stopped here for a morning coffee whilst visiting the Flower Dome and were shocked by the price. We had one coffee and a bottle of sparking water which came to S$20 - we didn't even get decent service for that.It's in a nice setting but that is really the only good thing about it
3
For the amount charged, this really isn't worth it. Went at 3:30pm, so basically it was tea, but had been assured there was food as the staff said they served steak (at S$40++). We ordered Linguini and the Burrata, watermelon juice and a latte. Total came up to $80. The latte was $10 and came in a small tea-cup (like the size for chinese tea). For someone who loves coffee, this was extremely disappointing. The Burrata tasted ok, it said on the menu it would be served with black olives, well it's pureed olives (just three little blobs). For such price, I would expect really better quality and better service. Yes, it came with access to the Flower Dome. Next time, just buy your entry ticket to the dome itself and eat somewhere else
3
The environment is so beautiful that it enhanced the dinning experience tremendously, or else the food and wine pairing would have ranked a very low score.
5
Thank you so much for the great dining experience at Pollen. We love the ambience and the afternoon tea set was simply delicious!

Reservation was smooth, buggy service was to our great convenience, service was excellent, food was amazing, ambience was great! I don't know how else things could be better.

6 of us friends went for dinner to Pollen last night. 3 of us ordered the tasting menu and 3 a la carte. My wife claims the vegetarian tasting menu was largely very good - but otherwise everything else was highly overpriced and nothing to write home about.To start while ordering the wine, the waiter kept bringing me a bottle of the same grape but much more expensive than the one I asked for and I had to send him back twice. We ordered a red and a white and they only served the white, even though one of us in our group wanted the red and they somehow decided to wait till the rest of us 5 drank the white before they served her. Had to tell them twice before they served her. They then spilt the red wine on the table.The foie gras was average, so was the poached salmon. My friend ordered the ribs which he said was good. Desserts were a uniform disaster. The worst was the Creme Catalan which tasted nothing like the original - to make matters worse they paired it with some awful basil paste. My friends ordered the chocolate desert and the strawberry one - which were also quite bad.Overall - avoidDamage for 6 of us including 2 bottles of wine which cost around 300 sgd, was 1200 sgd
5
The first thing you notice when you enter is the perfume of flowers. They let you in the flower dome, and walking in the evening without tourists is an incredibly romantic experience. The staff is young but attentive. The food is pricey but very good. We suggest to skip the starters and go to the main course directly because they serve an unexpectedly filling canapÃ© st the beginning. The whole experience? Just amazing
4
As a regular at Jason Atherton restaurants in London, the Singapore restaurant lived up to expectations. All the dishes were beautifully presented and delicious. Ignore the information desk at the Gardens & your hotel who may tell you you have to pay to get into the restaurant
3
Our family sat down for a quick snack at the terrace after walking around the Flower dome.You order your food at the bar, and pay first, then they will bring the food over.It took almost 30 minutes before food was served.The guy who took our order got the kids ice cream flavour mixed up and when informed by the waiter who took it back, made a fuss from behind the counter so that all the patrons could hear him which I think was not very professional for a restaurant with such reputation.It is quite expensive for what it is, especially so with such service
3
I went last weekend with some friends to have dinner here. The apetizers they offer are great, we loved them. But the risotto was not good, and the salmon was quite nice but not amazing as you would expect in a restaurant with such prices.So I think average to nice food, but too expensive for what's offered.Been to many restaurants with those prices or more and food is 10x better
4
Prompt service (props goes to Pollen for the complimentary buggy service too) upon arriving at the restaurant. Staff were extremely attentive and polite and food was great. I enjoyed the set lunch, especially the mushroom broth. Guests also get to enter the Flower Dome for free, this being a plus point
4
We had dinner In the bistro area which was very good. Walking through the flower garden in the evening and without the crowds was special. Don't buy a ticket to the flower dome eat here for dinner or just have a drink it perfect. Food was very good and happy hour drinks prices were ok for Singapore.
5
Pollen is essentially in the middle of a spectacular garden. The food and service are exemplary. Well worth a visit.
3
Slow service and mediocre food......and somewhat overpriced --"but it is lovely to have a cafe in the middle of the Flower Dome where you can relax over a coffee or cold drink and have a light lunch.
3
The menu is limited and overpriced, although the food they do offer was done nicely. The service was above average for Singapore, although at fine dining prices, leaves more to be desired. No plans to go back.
4
I was there with my family for my birthday recently and I'm pretty impressed with their food and service. Even though the restaurant was pretty packed that night but I think the waiting time for food was really long though. We waited almost an hour for our food to arrive! We were given some light appetizers while awaiting our food and I have to say I like their special butter a lot! We had their pork chop, salmon, NZ ling and tomahawk that night and fortunately, the food tasted really good it made up for the long waiting hours. The tomahawk can be easily shared between 2-3 person. It's done medium rare and the taste is awesome. Diners are also allow up to the Flower Dome for free so we managed a quick tour around the dome before dinner. Certainly a refreshing start to a meal. Their staffs are also very polite and ready to help. Overall, a pretty place to dine and wine as long as you don't mind the long waiting time for food
5
They are prompt and friendly. They called me almost immediately once I had made the reservation for my husband's birthday. They also replied to my emails and helped organise a window seat and small birthday cake. When we arrived, they didn't rush us and gave us time to walk around the garden dome
3
This cafe is in a nice location, inside the Flower Dome although the view is not the best of the flowers. The view of Marina Bay Sands behind the park is pretty good though.Service was great, menu is limited and a little expensive. Ice cream of 3 scoops was $9 each, and then 17% taxes on top of that.I'd still stop there for a small snack again though
3
Pollen was the first place we came across while looking around the domes but unfortunately the Prices were astronomical & the tiniest Cappucinos I have ever seen! Having said that the Carrot Cake was delicious and the best I have tasted! I just would have liked more! $29.43 was much more than I expected to pay
5
Can not recommend Pollen enough. I had booked Pollen Afternoon Tea to celebrate a friends 30th birthday. It did not disappoint. We had a fantastic afternoon. Great service ... the golf buggy shuttled from the visitors centre is a nice touch! Great food ... delicious scones and yummy macaroons!Great atmosphere ... sat amongst the flower dome whilst you drink your tea!Thank you Pollen team for making it such a pleasant experience.
5
From free buggy ride from the entrance to the restaurant to offering shaw (its really cold there) to meticulously explaining each dish that's served, their service is unquestionably fantastic. The ambience was romantic, you get to go into the floweer dome for free! We had the tasting dinner menu and it was great too. However, do expect that all these come at a price too
5
The waiter noticed that I was a leftie and arranged the cutlery accordingly - first time ever in my life. That was the most impressive part. Service was attentive and unintrusive. They explained each course before you ate it. There was a young girl whose accent we don't understand though. We gave up after the third try.Since we were celebrating my birthday, they took us on a tour in the kitchen.Food was so-so.We paid 600+++ for two (with I think 2 glasses of wine each)
4
Food is perfect especially the steak. Too bad that the second floor with better view is closed because of private events.
4
Ambience at the lunch/dinner dining area was good. The gourmet lunch set was well-worth. Food was exquisite and well presented. Service is prompt. Overall the experience was good.
5
We had a set lunch at Pollen. There was a choice of a few options for each of the three courses and we loved our choices. Flavours and textures were beautifully balanced for all the courses we chose. We really did think the quality was worthy of Michelin star status. Both the duck and hake main courses we loved. Perfectly cooked, and well presented. Service was excellent, attentive and friendly. On top of this you get a free shuttle to the visitors' centre and free flower conservatory access. Perhaps the only slight shortfall was in expertise in the wines offered and that the pairing offered was for one course rather than offering a smaller 100 ml recommendation for each course
4
Had high tea here on a weekend. Access is not easy as you would have to inform the restaurant of your arrival at Gardens by the Bay and they will send a buggy to pick you up right to Pollen. It would you be too far to walk. High tea is served on the upper level of the restaurant and it is overlooking the Flower Dome. Being a conservatory, the temperature was cooling inside and plenty of fresh flowers smells. One of the perks of the high tea is of course the free access to the flower dome. The high tea set was so so although coffee/tea is good and replenishable. Go there for the ambience definitely
3
Overall food and service was good. Thought more could be done as I indicated that it was my spouse's birthday and instead of just giving us a plate of sweets, a complimentary slice of cake maybe a better option but appreciate the effort in trying to do something.
4
After visiting the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore we decided to have lunch at the Pollen. Service was good, menu had a lot of options , the food was passable and the wine list quite extensive . However a bit pricey . We were fortunate they had a special on Australian wines a flat $50 per bottle. $150 for 2 people including wine
4
We went to Pollen with a (huge) group for a business dinner. The park and surroundings are just fabulous and inspiring for a walk.The food itself is good and has a touch of fusion (I am not a big fan of fusion but in this case, I enjoyed it). Try the 'foie gras' as started... excellent
5
Located in the heart of Gardens by The Bay, Pollen offers the perfect setting for a really romantic dinner. In fact, I brought the missus to this fantastic restaurant for our anniversary dinner this year and totally savored the experience. We still look back on it frequently and recall really fond memories both of the exceptional food and the ambience of the place. New to the place, we decided on the degustation menu since that will probably give us a full experience of the chef's culinary expertise. And since it was also our anniversary, we decided to treat ourselves to an additional 10 grams of truffles, which added to our food quite a bit of oomph! That came at a pretty decent price of an additional $100 ($10 per gram) for a restaurant of this quality. Every dish also came in visually stunning displays. I recall a friend who once shared with us what hospitality meant to an African: That the food they serve to their guests must be good to taste and better to see. In other words, good food must appeal to our visual senses too! And this was apparently the guiding principle for Pollen's gastronomic offerings too. Ask me if there was a particular favorite, I would say that every dish had a distinct and uniquely exceptional combination and burst of flavors. And the sequencing from dish to another is conscientiously thought through. Nothing random. There was quite an impressive science and art to the And the best part of the whole experience was the quality of service that Pollen offers. The maitre d was finessed in his service and attentive to our needs. While the restaurant was almost full with other customers, we felt like we were alone in our own little world. And with a little prompting, we even had the chance to go behind the scenes to meet with the Chef - which was truly an icing on the cake for us. Fancy an exceptional dinner in the heart of a gorgeous Garden? Try Pollen
3
I can't tell much about the quality of food here but it's really quite expensive. I got a glass of soda water for about S$8. The coconut passion cake was good but it was too small. I do not wish to go back here anymore and would rather spend my money in other restaurants
3
Pollen is an interesting place to dine in. Being a flagship of a Michelin-starred chef restaurant, food portion is small. Definitely insufficient for those who are very hungry. The food were presented beautifully though. Taste was okay only for the price paid. Service by the staff were excellent though
2
Friendly staff and pretty surroundings don't make up for the quality of food. Presentation was fantastic, but it just didn't taste as good as we expected.
3
Good view nice area to dine but food portions are small and overpriced. Taste of food so-so (should warm up food served) tea selection limited but quite nice
5
The restaurant is located in the gardens by the bay area within one of the large greenhouses. The food is excellent a global mis of different styles, quite unique. The staff is superb.
4
We stopped by for a coffee and light lunch. We had the arancini balls and chips. All were good quality and promptly delivered in a friendly way. The decor is terrific - modern within the great theatre of Gardens by the Bay.
3
Great location. If you dine here you get to visit the Flower Dome gratis. Great service and very friendly staff! The food is more reasonable in comparison to Sing prices but still expensive. The meat was very fatty even though I ordered the leanest one available. A real turnoff. Drinks are just too expensive everywhere in Singapore! Tried way too hard with pungent cheeses and appetizers..macaroons with goat cheese is a terrible mix!

My husband and I dined at Pollen for dinner mid-July. He spent the week in Singapore for business while I explored and the evening was meant to show him one of the "highlights" of the city. With a reservation at the restaurant, we received free admission to the Flower Dome, which along with the meal, is certainly a highlight of the ultra-modern Marina Bay area.Pollen's atmosphere is pretty special, with both spectacular views of the skyline and immersion in the indoor garden. Unlike some other guests, we weren't bothered by the cool room (we welcomed it in contrast with the extreme heat outside), but I was offered a shawl and we were provided with discreet space heaters that we adjusted to our comfort.Our waitstaff were kind and accommodating, especially to our dietary restrictions (a gluten allergy). One of our dishes contained breadcrumbs and our waiter immediately rushed back to our table to change out the item before we asked. We ordered pate, the indulgent tomahawk steak to share (served with bone marrow and a salad), a yummy bottle of wine with the assistance of the sommelier, and a beautiful, delicate lemon dessert. The meal was very satisfying and delicious! After dinner, a cart was provided to take us back to the entrance, but we asked to be dropped off by the Supertrees to have a nightcap and check out the skyline at night. All in all, we enjoyed an excellent meal and overall memorable activity
5
Dined at Pollen 3 years back, and revisited the restaurant last Sat, everything was at its best, the service was impeccable. As the restaurant was very cold due to the flower dome above, cashmere shawl was gladly provided and heater was placed behind us. Hot water was also given to keep us warm. The food too was beyond words. The steak, the lamb, the dessert... We finished everyday that we ordered. Definitely will be back in the future

Pollen offers an interesting experience. First, you get to pretend you are royalty, as you are transported by a buggy from the entrance of the Gardens to the doorsteps of the restaurant, past the crazy crowds who invade the Gardens during the weekends. Second, you get to embark in a pre-dinner adventure in a beautiful dome populated by fascinating flowers just before dinner - wrapped with a Pashmina scarf courtesy of the restaurant. The food is good and the service satisfying. Finally, if you are as lucky as we were, you get to see fireworks explode before your eyes - courtesy of the Singapore government for the SG50 celebrations. Quite a perfect evening, I must say. Tips: If you are going as a couple, order one set of the tasters' menu (with pairing wine), and order another set of mains. Rationale - The tasters' menu is good enough to warrant a recommendation but too expensive for two sets. Call the restaurant at least 5 minutes before you reach - the buggy takes about 10 minutes to reach the pick up point. You won't like the wait in the sweltering heat & humidity. No need for your own jacket. It is cold but the restaurant's Pashmina is good
4
We chose Pollen to host a small wedding tea reception for a group of about 20. Ages ranged from 12 to 90 and several with a strong aversion to the sun. Even so we were able to accomodate everyone comfortably.Eating at the restaurant allowed us to visit the Flower Dome free of charge which makes this one of the best deals in town. The wait staff were attentive and personable, rather uncharacteristic for Singapore. One gets the sense they are accustomed to western norms and customs

I would recommend this place for people looking for a sophisticated meal in an unusual venue in Singapore. Taste, food and wine list - it's well worth every penny.We came here for lunch on a Friday (public holiday) as we wanted to check the Flower Dome at the Gardens By The Bay. We reckon since we will be paying for the tickets, might as well have lunch at Pollen. As guest of the restaurant, you can get into the flower dome for free. Also, we've been wanting to try this place and just never gotten around to it.We ordered the lunch pre-fixed menu paired with wine. Every single dish was just as delectable as it was gorgeous. My expectations were met and have ticked all the right boxes. We ate every morsel that was placed in front of us. Don't date skip the dessert. It will cap your meal so beautifully.The service is a bit of a downer. The restaurant wasn't full - there were only 3 other tables apart from ours but getting every wait staff's attention was such an effort. The sophisticated place begs for muted conversation so waiving and calling the waiters attention was a bit unusual, if not embarrassing, for both parties. Don't you hate it when you are trying to call their attention and the wait staff someone pretends to not see you? For its service, I will give this place a very low rate. Surprised by the level of service for such esteemed restaurant.Will I go back? Probably. But only to show friends that have not tried this place. There are a dime and a dozen place in Singapore than can offer a similar experience. I hope the service will improve as the food is just divine

Ate the dinner last saturday. Cannot understand why the food taste so werid,are they trying too hard to cater to sg ppl taste?? Dont feel the cook effort so sad
5
I made a booking here on the recommendation of a friend - he had commented that the food was good and the service fantastic.He was right!After ordering from the al a carte menu, we were presented with canapés. Wow. Tiny morsels of amazing flavour.For entree I had a cured salmon dish that looked like an absolute work of art.It was a masterpiece of food creativity and tasted as amazing as it looked.Main, I had the roast lamb - I have never had a roast this good. Everything on the plate was perfect - we ordered a few sides as well. Delicious!Dessert - we couldn't go past the house specialty apple tartin. It was to share between two. This was just simply perfect.We were then given small chocolates, like a dessert version of the canapés. Just fantastic.Overall, the service was okay. Not perfect, but above average for Singapore.The menu and food was just simply stunning. Hats off to the incredibly talented chefs

Pollen is a small little neat cafe nestled within the Flower dome, a air-conditioned conservation biodome in the tourist attraction, Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. Having high tea in Pollen is a delight though i highly recommend making reservations for it during the weekend as it can get tight and crowded. But high tea is wonderful and high tea portions are okay, not too small but neither is it a veritable buffet. Only disappointment is the small list of tea to choose from but the wine selection is divine. As I only had high tea, I do not have any opinions on how good their lunch/dinner menu is. Because of its location within the Flower dome at Gardens by the Bay, Pollen is really a final destination, rather than a place before the next destination. But it is because of that, you'll get a wonderful stress free and quiet place to have high tea or lunch without the crowds to content with (except for weekends) Tips: There are two entrances to Pollen. One from within the flower dome in which you have to pay the entrance fee to get in and the other entrance is from the exterior of the dome along the sea wall. The second entrance has no entrance fee
5
My daughter and I stopped in for lunch after going through the flower dome and before heading back out into the heat.The food was excellent as were the drinks (cocktails were delicious!).It's a little pricey and the menu is quite fancy but I thought it was worth it. It's a lovely little corner of the dome to sit in and relax
3
I was expecting a better quality in the food and the drinks .. Is ok for a break in the middle of your day if you are already in the gardens ... Don't go for the high tea , is not very good
3
The first time I came here, I vowed never to come again. Being a tourist and coming with my children from the Flower Dome for lunch, I found that the entire setting was for business set lunches. As a result the business people were upset about that I had a young toddler who wasn't crying but was making some noise as a young toddler. Set menu was much more worth it then the a la carte menu but was forgettable. So all in all, I had a very unpleasant experience. Having said that, I have been back for business dinner and its a nice place to bring customers. They get to see the Flower Dome for free with lunch / dinner which is always a good experience. No worries about the business suit because they have a buggy bring you from the front entrance. Food is still forgettable with nicer food in town with a lot less hassle. And I do prefer Esquina in terms of food rather than Pollen. (another James Atherton restaurant). Restaurant is VERY cold because the aircon is controlled by the cooling from the Flower Dome so its much cooler than a normal restaurant - please remember to bring your cardigan or jacket.

Inside the spectacular Flower Dome at Gardens By The Bay there is only one place where you can pause for a drink, which is the beautifully designed but rather small Pollen Restaurant, tucked into one end of the dome. It is certainly a very attractive place to dine but we went there for a morning coffee and maybe a small cake or pastry. Bad call by us! In fact Pollen is a very expensive upmarket restaurant, which is a curious decision in such a popular location. Well, we got our coffee ($6.50) and our English Breakfast tea ($9.50) and because we had to order some food in order to have the drinks, we ordered mixed olives (there were no cakes!) for $14.00! So if you go to Pollen, go to eat! Afternoon tea, we discovered, is $38 each, and set lunch is $55 without wine. A La Carte lunch is a lot more and to be fair, it's a very attractive menu too. Our rating is based on our morning coffee experience only, please note
5
Based on a friend recommendation that had dined at Pollen previously our group of 3 decided we just had to go. Might I say we were not disappointed, the food was simply devine. I had a starter of Beetroot cured salmon with accompliments & I could eat this everyday it was so delicious. Main course & dessert were also fabulous. We were also fortunate enough to be asked to meet the chef & his team in the kitchen.This restaurant must be included as a dining option while in Singapore.....I can't wait until I return to visit Pollen once again.
5
Three adults and my seven year old son had a lovely set lunch at Pollen. Prompt pick up service that took us straight to Pollen. Wait staff was attentive and did not have to wait long for our meal. Absolutely delicious 3 course we all got different options and they were all exquisite! They also provided complimentary entrees and macaroons for my son at the end of our meal. Highly recommended for a fine dining experience with views to match. You also get free entry to the flower dome if you dine at Pollen which was an added bonus. The only thing I would recommend they improve is they do not have a kids menu selection they offered either pasta with cream sauce or napolitan sauce for my son. Maybe something like steak and mash or lamb cutlets and mash and he would have loved it

A cloudy day of visitation by Marina Bay Sand's popular Gardens by the Bay. The Pollen restaurant is one of few high-end restaurants located directly beside a recently-established component and a must-visit Singaporean travel destination in the Bay Gardens called "the Flower Dome".The Pollen provides a special shuttle service to and from the MBS hotel or information centre. So make sure to ask if you intend to dine at the Pollen, unless you prefer walking under in the typically hot Singaporean humidity for 500m or so to get to/fro the Flower Dome from MBS hotel. You would cut through the various mini 'outdoor cultural gardens' that range from chinese-indian-malay gardens etc. I would recommend saving your energy and resources if it's not your 1st visit. Considering the size of the Bay Gardens itself, and the huge size of the Dome, it takes a bit more effort than necessary to find the restaurant if you end up on the polar end of the Dome from where the restaurant is. Dining at the Pollen provides free access to the Flower Dome. So for a $55++ set lunch consisting of a starter, main meal and dessert, nice ambience, you get FREE access to the Flower Dome. So do not pay for tickets to enter the Flower Dome separately if you intend to eat at the Pollen. You will not be reimbursed.The price of single a-la-carte dishes ranged $30++. Therefore making the set meal of $55++ very worthwhile in comparison. Although, I must say that the meal tasted pretty average. The cost probably covers more of the cost of ambience, convenience of location, and blue cashmere shawls (80% pashmina, 20% silk) that they provide diners due to the constant and cold air-conditioning. The Pollen accepts reservations and on-the-spot dine-ins. Tap water is not provided. Still water costs $18 per bottle.For the set menu, please refer to the photo posted -I am fully willing to cooperate and remove this picture if requested and if informed that it does not comply with any form of regulation. Do let me know. Ty.-Food ordered (through the set meal):Starters: chicken liver parfait, big-eyed tunaMain meal: braised duroc pork cheek, roasted hake Dessert: lemon, dulce de lecheAs expected from these forms of fine-dining restaurants, the plates were small; with exception of the main hake fish I got that swam in octopus broth. The broth was tasty but relative to the dish as a whole, did not seem to complement it much. The dessert of lemon was too sour for me. The big-eyed tuna was refreshing and probably the best dish of the set.In the overall, The Pollen restaurant has:- nice ambience- friendly service- convenient location beside the Flower Dome- shuttle service- average food- price
4
They treat you well here, and the food was delicious. Cool view of the garden as well. Cold inside restaurant but they provide something for women to keep warm
2
I went through with 2 colleagues for lunch and was not impressed. The food was simply ok, nothing to rave about. Once is more than enough, sad to say.
5
I had lunch there and it was a marvelous experience. The restaurant located inside of the Singapore's Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay which is climate controlled. The quality of of food was good and delicious, while the service was nice and punctual. It's a fine dining restaurant but the price was reasonable. Not cheap but reasonable. They have a 3 course lunch menu to choose from. I'll recommend this restaurant to those who like to have good experience of having lunch in Singapore
5
Decided to visit Pollen after a trip to the Flower Dome and it was a great decision. A little on the expensive side but well worth it for the quality of the food and the fabulous service. We elected to eat a la carte as opposed to the tasting menu, but by by the time you are served pre starters, amuse bouche and pre desserts it feels like you you've had a full tasting experience. Everything we had was superbly tasty and well presented. It is very cool in there as it is part of the heavily air conditioned Flower Dome so do wrap up warmly. We were both offered their nice silk pashminas to keep the chill off - my wife looked fine in hers, me...not so much, so I politely declined. I have to repeat that the service was exceptional - attentive (without being overbearing), helpful and knowledgeable. We will dine there again on our next visit to Singapore
3
The thing I like about this place is the setting and ambience. The restaurant is set in a intimate corner of Gardens by the Bay and has a nice rock fountain as decor. I had lunch with my family there and it felt nice and private from the way the tables are set up. The food to me tasted average and portions are very small. We were still quite hungry after our 3 course meal and they were pricey as well. Service was ok.One upside is that the entrance to gardens by the bay is free if you dine in their restaurant.
4
Staff are so ready to introduce each dishes to us. Food are super nice.Just wish there is buggy service from the Bayfront MRT station so that we can reach the restaurant in a more direct route without having to pay extra for the shuttle and a long way after getting off
5
The beauty of Flower Done kept me inside and occupier for hours and began to feel the need for some immediate fuel for the body. Pollen located inside the done itself was a delight for the sore eyes. Well Priced , its ideal and recommeded place to keep your energy levels up while you are a Globe Trotting walk inside the Dome
4
Went to the Pollen for a birthday lunch, they provided buggy service from the visitor centre at the Gardens By the Bay. The buggy was there waiting when we arrive and it took less than 5 mins' ride. The restaurant was cold and we've been warned. Situated inside the Flower domw, the restaurant doesnt on their air con but rely from the cool air coming from the dome. they have heaters if we ever need them.Food was nice and we tried their lunch set at SGD $55++ per pax. Canapes and bread were served. Food portion were small but nice. Tried their short pork cheeks and roasted hake and it was tender and juicy. Service is prompted and good

I've taken many guest to Pollen whenever they're in SG. I'm proud of Pollen's location and they've nice buggy car picking you up at the Visitor's information counter. I must have been to Pollen at least 5 times. However, it seems to be going downhill slightly each time I visit them. When Pollen first started in its first year, the set lunch you get tea/coffee + many small little cute choc/sweets at the end of your meal. Then since last year? you've to pay extra for tea/coffee. Main course portion was reduced significantly too. I feel hungry pretty soon after the lunch. Overall, presentation of food is still pretty but you can see they're trying hard to cut the cost on the amount of food served

Often you have to choose - do I go for the fabulous setting? Do I max out on the creative food? What about the waitstaff? At Pollen, it all comes together. The Flower Dome in Singapore is a fabulous floral confection - worthy of its own visit, but having the restaurant right there means the floral scenery extends right in to the restaurant. The food in the prix fixe lunch special is creative, visually appealing, and extraordinarily tasty (the pairing of deep chocolate crumbles with chicken liver in a starter along with pear and other tastes was both a taste and visual masterpiece). And the careful service, timely, friendly, without being intrusive, completed the experience. Treat yourself - this one's a keeper

Food was excellent, service standard was very good and set in such beautiful surrounding. Highly recommended especially for lunch!
4
Great western food with a good collection of wines. The appetizers and desserts were delicious. Main course was average. Has a great view of the Singapore eye.
5
Very good service and the food was exceptional. The atmosphere was nice and we even had a short tour of the kitchen.
5
Top notch dinning. One of the best places to bring your significant other. Especially if the other hasn't been to Pollen before. Loved it!

Booking at the restaurant gives you free access to the beautiful gardens so good to get there ahead of your reservation so you can wander around and work up an appetite.A really delicious and well thought-out menu. Each mouthful was a taste sensation and the service was excellent. To start I had Potato soup with soft poached hen’s egg, crab, spring onion and for the main I had BBQ Iberico pork chop, roasted baby leeks, chicory, apple with sage polenta. The portion sizes were not overwhelmingly big but enough to fill you up. We were also offered a selection of hors d’oeurves while we waited.Given the regulated temperature of the gardens the restaurant did get a little cold but pashminas are given to all the guests to keep warm

BAD! Your service is really HORRIBLE! Only one lady staff put on a smile when I walked in and another male staff who changed our table for us. The rest of your staffs do not look friendly at all and they looked so unhappy! Also I booked Pollen for Hightea on a Friday at 2.30pm, but when I arrived, they told me that they have function and could not cater me at all until 4.30pm. They told me they sent me an email, which I did not receive at all. I have proof too that nothing has been received and not even calls was reached to my phone! I am not a local Singaporean and I do not have flexible time at all to change my plannings. Food was also horrible as everything was too salty. I was very disappointed as your restaurant should prepared the high tea already when I made my booking. I even called a day before to reconfirm if the hightea can be served on time! I had friends and family with me and I was so embarrassed about the services and quality of food that you present. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO YOUR RESTAURANT ANYMORE. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER

This was an absolute top class experience, equal to the levels of service, food, wine and ambience one would expect in France, UK etc amongst the top establishments. I had high expectations for anything with Atherton's name and my expectations were exceeded. The venue is incredible. The buggy service a wonderful touch as a start to the whole theatre of a tasting menu experience. The cocktails upstairs are a quick must if not to glimpse (or fully explore) the dome and then the meal downstairs is in such a lovely setting, good lighting, not too bright and views over the marina. So pleased we had the tasting menu with matched wines. We had some very interesting but superbly matched wines, including a sweet wine with the foie gras course that worked brilliantly. I loved the heritage tomato course and the barramundi especially. We added a cheese course and the selection was great. I was particularly impressed with the sommelier who guided us though the wine flight so knowledgably. I cannot believe the price of the wine flight- such good value and included a fine cognac! Especially given Singapore prices for alcohol the price was equal to a typical London wine pairing. We will be returning here for the many more dining experiences and we left blown away with the restaurant. I still do not understand why Singapore has not had any Michelin inspectors? It doesn't make any sense as this would have definitely added to our next goal of total stars! It is totally unreasonable for reviewers to comment about the price of the restaurant, they clearly have no idea of fine dining as the price is testament to the level of cooking and the calibre of the chefs- at the top of their field

We had a wonderful lunch for my husbands birthday, the food was delicious and the service was great which is hard to find both in Singapore. If you want to indulge go for the Tomahawk steak to be shared between two or more. The only thing I can falter is that it is very cold in the restaurant they do provide pashminas but I would take a cardigan with you.Thank you for a great experienc
5
Took a visiting friend to the Gardens by the bay and we decided to pop in for lunch. Very good quality of food and service, though prices are quite steep for set lunch at $45 ++ .If budget no issue, certainly an excellent choice for a beautifully surrounded restaurant set in the Flower Dome!The bistro was also good for more casual dining
5
Excellent Service and excellent food! We are vegetarians and so the options are really limited. But every single item was superb and the chefs are really creative. The waiters were also very knowledgeable and recommended the right drinks to go with the food, and they really knew their stuff. They made my wife feel special with a pashmina before we went out to see the amazing place outside - all in all, we had a wonderful time! It's certainly expensive, but have to say-was worth every cent! We had gone there for our anniversary and it was truly a special occasion. Would recommend it highly for couples
4
Great ambience, excellent service. Good for dinner. Fresh ingredients. Excellent presentation of food.
5
Everything from the attitude of the staff, to the quality of the meal was excellent. Nice touch was the kitchen tour at the end as well as free entrance to the beautiful flower dome that Pollen is attached to.
4
The food at Pollen was excellent. You did not have to wait too long for each course to arrive. It is a very different experience eating in a greenhouse. The only issue is that you should bring a jacket or wear warm clothing. I thought that wearing a polo shirt and khakis was enough for a dinner in Singapore. But it is quite freezing cold in there. If it gets too cold, you can ask for a heater (that made a huge difference). We had the Scallop appetizer which was very tasty. The Wagyu Onglet was very tender and very tasty. The fish main course was also very tasty too. Presentation of all dishes was also top notch. The mango and coconut dessert was not the most amazing dessert as I probably expected too much. Do request for a window side table if possible. It is just really cool to have a nice dinner in a greenhouse where you can smell fresh plants and flowers. A unique experience in Singapore for sure. Best part is that if you are too full after your meal, you can take a long relaxing walk at Gardens by the Bay

I've thought long and hard before writing the review, the meal was a present from our family and I had high expectations based on the website.We arrived slightly early for our booked time, but the restaurant was quiet so the staff suggested that we have a wander around the flower dome, we returned at the correct time and were shown to our seats. We were given our menus and offered a glass of wine while we chose our meal.Once we ordered the starters arrived reasonably quickly, followed by the mains and then the dessert and that was the issue we were never asked if we wanted any drinks during the meal, despite being given the wine and cocktail menu.The who thing felt a little rushed, normally at these types of restaurants the staff are attentive, but you are not overtly aware of them being there, daft as it sounds, however it felt like we were being fussed over.None of the food was overly hot, we opted for the expensive dessert that included a dessert wine and two desserts and should have included an amuse, but that never appeared.The reason I have been struggling about the review is that, although the food was nice, for the type of restaurant it is and the cost of the meal it wasn't up to the standard that I would expect. The meal cost over £200 for the two of us and had I paid for it I would have not been happy. I've eaten at several Michelin stared restaurants and some high class places that could have gotten stars had they tried and I don't think Pollen is up to that standard. I have tried to be fair and compare Pollen to these restaurants as opposed to comparing it to our local chippy

My family had paid for myself and my husband to have meal here for our birthdays. I was expecting amazing things and was sadly disappointed. When seated we were offered a wine aperitif while we reviewed the menu. Our canapes arrived and we ordered our starter and main meal choices. I wasn't asked whether I'd wanted a cocktail and before we knew it our starters arrived. We felt quite hurried and the main arrived pretty soon after the starter had been cleared. I'd wanted a glass of red with my meal and was not asked and didn't get the opportunity to ask either. I'd say the food was nice but I've had better, The food wasn't hot either. We ordered the dessert degustation which supposedly consisted of an "amuse" and 2 desserts together with a glass of dessert wine. We never got the "amuse" and we were surprised that the dessert wine was whisked away with a tiny bit left in the bottle. It looked as though it was a third of a bottle-sized bottle and I thought would have gone between the 2 of us. Surely you wouldn't go to a table with the dregs of a bottle? This dessert option was £30, a bit pricey for what we did/didn't get

When I first read about Pollen, my thought was wow a Michelin star Chef restaurant. Without a doubt I made a business high tea meeting. The experience is impressive , well good enough to impact my guests. A pickup from the garden by bay reception , followed by a guest officer who calls you by name. Nice. High tea is on second floor and eminence is in the layout. Much like a french cafe with a leading to a floral Kingdom. With French music played at backdrop, the mood is relaxing. A must for business meet. However, the high tea spread which mimics fine dining dampers the whole works. Price is relatively high and the high tea food tastes average. So, my recommendation is to impress clients this is the place but don't oversell on the high tea menu
5
We had lunch in the restaurant which is at the bottom of the garden dome. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced at lunchtime. We had a baby with us and they provided a high chair. The only thing to be aware of is that the dome is air conditioned and being at ground floor level cold air drops! We could have benefitted from warmer clothing (a first in Singapore!). When you eat at the restaurant you have free access to the garden dome which is well worth a visit. They also do afternoon tea which is apparently very nice too.
4
Service is impressive from the moment you are picked up n transferred to the restaurant in a golf cart. The driver is friendly n makes u feel welcomed. At the restaurant the mitre d receives us with a dazzling smile n suggested we view the tupils at the flower dome first. That was a treat! The dining experience is just as pleasant. The food is v good. We had the. Recommended Tomahawk - a massive one kg rib done perfectly! The Sommelier is helpful, knowledgable, patient n charming
1
The service here was very good. However the quality of the food was not reflective of the steep price. Further the restaurant is kept cool as it is part of a cooled glass house. The problem with this is if food is not served immediately it quickly becomes cold. This happened to us. My steak was not of the highest quality and my wife got two very small pieces of cod in her main dish. All in all it was disappointing
5
What a lovely discovery Pollen was on our recent trip. Just outstanding! We enjoyed celebrating a birthday with beautiful location, decor and ambience. The service and food was impeccable. The offer of a tour of the kitchen at the end of the night was the icing on the cake.The only thing to mention is that it is very cold in here, due to the air flow through the Flower Dome. The offers of a heater and pashminas helped, but it was still chilly.I'd love to return. Thanks for an incredible and memorable meal
5
We stopped at The Pollen terrace garden for a short break in the beautiful Flower dome at Gardens by the Bay. Service was prompt and efficient but we thought it was expensive at $16S for the coffee and cafe special.
4
Was great service, tucked away in the flower dome at Gardens by the bay. Food was great albeit maybe a little expensive as was the wine, but a beautiful setting to sit and relax and enjoy a few minutes off your feet
5
The restaurant is quite with romantic atmosphere, the staffs are very friendly and sensitive to the customer!
5
This was our second lunchtime visit to Pollen to celebrate a birthday. Fabulous service with a smile across the board. A special mention to Gliza who remembered us from our first visit and made both occassions v. special. The last time around, she arranged for us to meet the chef. The lunch set is absolutely delicious and quite filling and really good value for money. (You also get free access to the flower dome). Gorgeous presentation of food and great flavor profiles. We are vegetarian but didn't feel short changed in terms of our food choices. Highly recommend it.

In the park Gardens by the Bay that every visitor to Singapore should explore. The restaurant on the ground floor has an very attractive ambiance: it has beautiful views of the park and the iconographic Marina Bay Sans Hotel. Friendly and professional staff: they provided us with excellent advice on the menu and accompanying wines. The menu is limited but shows vision and passion. One can go for a 6 course tasting menu for S$160 or have a choice from about 30 dishes with many interesting and suprising combinations of food, all with a strong orientation to the European cuisine. The quality and richness of the dishes is without doubt at the level of a star restaurant. The only thing that disappoints are the exorbitant prices for the wines

I visited Pollen SG twice, once for a business lunch and most recently a quick weekday lunch with the wife. On both occassions, i expected a peaceful setting where we could conduct a business discussion or have a simple meal: both were ruined by the insane decibel level of its other patrons. The latest visit was marred but what i can only describe as: "little india trying out to out accent each other". While they were paying patrons and due their fair share, it is an issue when you can't hear yourself think or even savor the food/drink. While the staff were overall impeccable in terms of service and menu knowledge, perhaps they need to have protocols for handling overly loud/rowdy patrons ruining it for other tables (who were justifiably and visibly annoyed). Pollen has potential as i can appreciate what they are trying to accomplish in terms of food and setting, but for the same price point, there are numerous other venues that offer equally good menus without the decibel level of a wet market
5
We have eaten at several of Jason Atherton's restaurants so were delighted to discover Pollen in Singapore. We took guests for lunch and ate from the set lunch menu which, at SG$55 was great value. The food and service were exceptionally good and also included canapÃ©s and petit fours. The setting, within the Flower Dome in the Garden in The Bay is beautiful but in my opinion under advertised. It was so discreet most visitors will be unaware of it's presence. Thanks for a fabulous lunch. Can't wait to visit again. Will have to make do with the Little Social in the meantime!
5
The staff made me and my date feel exceptionally welcomed at the restaurant where we ordered a starter, two mains and a dessert. All the food was excellent esp the complimentary tasting dishes. My date's drink wasn't to par and they didn't charge us for it. The price is decent for the ingredients you get. Both me and my date were very satisfied
5
My favourite, special occasion restaurant in Singapore. Equisite food and service in a lovely flower dome at you can enjoy between courses. Highly recommended
4
i avoided this place for years because having to park and then take a buggy put me off of it due to the potential time delays etc. and my generally tight schedule. So when I was recently invited to a lunch at Pollen I figured I wouldT just suck it up and give the place a try. I was not not disappointed. The 55 $ set menu for lunch is an excellent deal and my swordfish steak was perfect. WARNING: the place can be cold so dress for it - but it did heat up as the sun moved into position. Also note that the staff are a bit slow (or more likely poorly trained) so you need to be proactive in asking for menus and drinks etc., or you will be waiting forever, which is a shame considering how good the food is..
5
Excellent setting, music, and food; includes free passes to the flower dome. Easily one of Singapore's most underrated.
4
Had high tea there and I must say it is one of the best in town. The high tea set comes with sweet and savoury items. From macaroons and mini cakes, to cured salmon and lovely scones. Every item was delicate and you can tell they are all passionately crafted by the Chefs. Located in the Flower Dome, the atmosphere was simply perfect for dates and family.Really enjoyed my time there! Oh yeah, free flower dome entry whenever you dine at Pollen, so don't forget to give them a call when you arrive. =
4
We went there on a Private Dining Event organised by DBS Private Bank. The evening started at the drink the bar on the 1st floor. The bar has an access to the pretty Flower Dome of Garden by the Bay. You can see the beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands from the other side. We had a set of wine pairing, degustation of French and Italian menu. The service was good. Food was good. 5-Star on location and ambience
4
While we were not exactly blown away by the overly fusion set lunch, the wonderful ambience and excellent service sure made up for it. Manager Nur went the extra mile to make sure my wife was nicely surprised by coordinating my special request. My wife and I loved every bit of the garden dining experience but do bring a sweater as it can get quite chilly in the flower dome. The complimentary entry to the flower dome was also a great way to walk off the meal. Visitors on foot to Gardens by the Bay looked envious of us taking the complimentary buggy service right to the doorstep of the restaurant, which also ferried us back to the entrance after everything was over
5
We came to this restaurant on recommendation by friends who lives in Singapore. Highly recommend the $55 set menu for lunch, which includes 3 courses and 3 delicious options for each course. You have the choice of adding a glass of wine for $15 per person and $5 extra for tea/coffee. This is exceptional value if you plan on visiting the Flower Dome as entry is included.I did read other reviews where they thought the serving size was small. I thought it was a typical western serve for a fine dining experience with beautifully presented food.The restaurant staff are fantastic and very professional. Combined with the wonderful food made our experience here a very memorable one.The only small issue we had was finding the entry to the restaurant after getting to the gardens by MRT. If you stand facing the entry to the Flower dome, walk around the dome from your left (clockwise around the dome) til you see a POLLEN restaurant sign. It's not well sign posted and we spoke to a couple of customer service staff before one knew but wasn't entirely sure
4
This restaurant is within the premises of Flower dome at the Gardens by the bay. You can enjoy Happy Hour meals here at S$11.95 from 6 to 9 pm on Monday to Friday. Nice place to sit by the bay, in a very cool atmosphere, a midst flowers all around. Good service. Good tasty food
4
A pleasant 10 minute walk through the beautiful Gardens by the Bay or a 2 minute shuttle bus ride will get you to Pollen. This is part of the Flower Dome so while waiting for the food, do walk through the small walkway and enjoy the flower display. Because the restaurant is contiguous with the temperature controlled Dome, it's very cold so do bring a thick sweater. If you forget to do so, the serving staff kindly offer a blanket!Food was unusual, best typified by the opening canapés that were morsels of unique combinations of flavours and consistencies. Truffle chicken parfait came with a lovely truffle brioche. The Wagyu shoulder was tender but not particularly memorable. The desserts were somewhat too esoteric to be enjoyed - Black Forest cherry, pandan, chocolate, Shimeji, roasted tomato - and that's just one dessert! The petit fours were delicious and made up for the disappointing dessert. Service was slow and disorganised even though the restaurant was less than half full on a weekday night.

i was there with my wonder gf for dinner . everything was good accept the air-con was too cold . both of us are freezing with both heater aiming at us . other than that everything was wonderful ! thank
4
Firstly, the restaurant has really excellent staff who were very polite and professional. I didn't get the names of any of the staff, but I was most impressed with the female waitress who was at the front desk welcoming customers and managing the bills, i believe.The restaurant is accessible for those arriving by car and by taxi, but by no other means. I was dropped off by a car at the MBS Hotel, and only then realised that the buggy service to the restaurant was not offered from there. The confirmation email i had received regarding my reservation hadn't made it clear enough that the buggy service was only offered from the Gardens' visitor centre, and not from the hotel. I was told that i then had to walk via the MRT station to the Gardens By The Bay, and then proceed to the visitor centre. Thanks to extremely useless and misleading signs around the Gardens, I ended up walking all the way to Pollen itself, and arrived drenched in sweat whilst wearing my nicest clothes. However, once I arrived, the waitress I mentioned earlier was very apologetic and appeasing, and was sure to keep my glass of water full at all times.Food-wise, i went with the set lunch. The portions were VERY small. For starters, I ordered the Butternut Squash Veloutè with Slow-Cooked Hen's Egg, which was absolutely excellent. For mains, i had the Angus Beef Teres Major, which was tasty but disappointing, and for dessert i had the Banoffee Pie, which was very disappointing because the pie was half the size of my pinkie finger, surrounded by 3 scoops of ice cream. Overall, I enjoyed my time there, but mainly because of the excellent staff and the pleasant atmosphere of the Flower Dome. Perhaps if i ordered something from the main menu as opposed to the set menu, my culinary experience would've been better.
4
The restaurant is located inside the flower dome in the Gardens by the Bay. The afternoon tea was served in the upper floor with a view of the flowers. Food is okay but not surprising, and the price is reasonable. Consumption at Pollen includes complimentary access to the flower dome. advised to book in advance.

Dinner at Pollen was the most gourmet experience that I've had in Singapore. The attention to detail with the food and service was exceptional. We had the sea bass and swordfish, both of which were outstanding. The swordfish was like none other that I've had.The service was by far the best that I've experienced in Singapore. The staff was extremely attentive, professional yet personable and very knowledgeable about the menu. It made our meal that much more memorable and will bring us back to Pollen for sure.The buggy service from the visitor centre is a nice touch and added to the enjoyment of the evening. The only complaint (and the reason I rated very good and not excellent) is the atmosphere. Other than the temperature and the wonderful smell of flowers, it's hard to know that you are in the flower dome. The restaurant has very low ceilings with track lighting. It felt a bit like a temporary airport lounge when the normal business class lounge is under construction. With this in mind, I still highly recommend Pollen for a top notch Singapore dining experience
5
By far one of the most sophisticated restaurants in Singapore in terms of culinary skills.Was very impressed with the myriad flavours that complemented each other and the variety of textures in each dish.I would caution readers that the serving portions are small as with modern restaurants. I was prepared and we ordered 3 mains for the 2 of us to share. I really would have flipped if i had only ordered the beef for my main. (Pics uploaded). We had the Beef SHOULDER, pigeon breast ( i tot it was supposed to be whole bird), and sword fish. Other than the swordfish which I am not accustomed to eating cooked, every dish was really well executed and delicious. And we did tell our server the dessert was sooo good we could eat triple portions of each lemon meringue tart and benoffee pie. "All our desserts are deconstructed!" He mentioned like 3 times.The setting is in the flower dome is really charming and unbeatable (there's only one restaurant in the flower dome at the Gardens by the Bay
5
My wife celebrated our wedding anniversary there and we had the tasting menu. We are not into fine cuisine that much but this was exceptional. There was creative mix of ingredients and sauces. The main courses however were nothing to shout about. The service was good and attentive and the sommelier was knowledgeable of his wine. The imperfection was having a family with a young child seated next to us. He was not noisy but very restless and was sometimes walking around the restaurant. I suggest management impose a minimum age policy to keep its standing as a fine dining restaurant
5
The food and service are absolutely what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. I rarely get food envy but when I tasted my colleagues salmon dish I wished I had this instead of the Swordfish I ordered. The highlight are the small courses you get between your starter and mains...beetroot meringue with goats cheese filling OMG. The only disappointment was the very expensive red wine we bought as it was, as seems customary in Singapore, was chilled and totally tasteless. I understand that wine spoils quickly in the prevailing temperatures but surely a restaurant of this calibre can afford a wine fridge to keep its wines at the temperature they deserve.
5
Service is really good. Lunch set didnt surprise me a lot. But the dessert JAAL is probably the best I ve ever tried among them all. It gives a balanced combination. Btw. The house wine is good.
4
The most memorable thing about having tea at Pollen is the temperature. You sit in a flower garden terrace sipping tea, and are instantly transported to a crisp Mediterranean spring evening. Actually I'm mistaken - the most noteworthy thing is that all that only costs you $38 pp, a fraction of most hotel high teas! Unfortunately the service and dishes are a bit of a let down, besides the exceptionally good scones and jam. Last thing: We had to change diapers, and were dumbfounded to see the park's restrooms had no changing station.
5
Not cheap, but ambience, food and service was outstanding. Highly recommended for a special occasion
1
We decided to make reservation high tea on the 2nd floor of Pollen right next to the Flower Dome. We realised we were hungrier than what the high tea set had to offer (3 types of savoury bites and 3 types of sweet selection) so decided to opt for the ala carte menu instead. When it comes to placing our order the place was half empty so the waiter (named Wan) took the upon himself to take our order at the table and was not shy in expressing his displeasure that as we have chosen to stray away. He claims that in our reservation email, it states that no cancellation is allowed for high tea reservation due to wastage. However, there wasn't anything stated in it that states so. When asked what is wasted, he couldn't explain and was fidgeting throughout the frail attempt to steer us away from ordering from the kitchen. I wasn't happy with the way he handled it because alas, he caved and allowed us to order from the ala carte menu. It was clear that he showed signs of laziness as understandably it was more of a workload for him to serve high tea set than to serve fresh meals from the kitchen. So being nice girls that we are 2 out of 4 of my girlfriends caved into ordering the high tea set to mediate the situation. Food was of course sub par as any garden side restaurant but it was a shame that one bad apple makes the whole team look bad. As I type, it's 45mins since I sat down, we seriously regretted our decision to come here
5
The dinner was excellent. From the amuse bouches to the desert, all first class. I had the sea bass which was perfect and very creatively prepared. Another one of us had the venison which was really superb and perfectly cooked
5
Pollen was recommended by our daughter and son-in-law who live in Singapore ( son -in- law said his meal was one of the best he has had in Singapore. ). We went with great expectations and the restaurant lived up to its reputation. The setting, within the Gardens on the Bay complex is lovely. The atmosphere was tranquil compared to the hustle and bustle of outside. The staff were attentive and polite. The service was also very good- it can be slow in Singapore, but not here. The food was delicious and the portion sizes just right. Everything was beautifully presented. We loved our meal and will return the next time we are in Singapore. Highly recommended
5
I invited some family members to dine at Pollen and was greatly impressed by the service and the food. It was superb! After dining they offer us a tour of the kitchen and we met the chef who was really nice. Totally recommended!
5
Outstanding experience. We had the vegetarian set lunch with some wine and juice. Attentive and knowledgeable staff. Also got to walk to the Flower Dome for free!! 
5
We had the tasting menu and vegetarian tasting menu with matching wines and it was a magnificent experience with each course bringing a new culinary experience of intricate and beautifully created food.The food, wine, service and atmosphere (in the flower dome) made for an extraordinary experience that was a highlight of our singapore holiday. Bravo Pollen
5
Everything is fresh & delicious. From the steamed buns drizzled in truffle oil & freshly baked bread served with humus & butter to starters & main and finally dessert, cappuccino & green tea that capped our meal, everything was just perfect. A surprise complimentary petit fours for two also arrived at the end. How nice!Attentive receptionist offered us pashmina to ward off the chill. Very thoughtful. You get free access to garden so better make time to explore the beautiful garden. It's definitely worth the time. Thank you for a very nice experience. We'll be back
4
Very well presented fine dining, friendly staff and good wine list. We were also offered a tour of the kitchen and given an insight into the workings of a top quality restaurant. Would recommend to people looking for an experience in a city where good food is highly sought after
4
We love to watch Great British Menu and in our travels around the world make sure, if we can, experience the food from chefs we have seen on the TV. Pollen can now be checked off as done and we can say...Beautiful! The venue and the food was beautiful. Service was a little staid but could not fault the food. Great flavours,fresh produce and good value.
5
The experience at Pollen was amazing. From the moment you walk in you feel unique, the attention to details, the waiters were very kind and the dishes superb. Totally recommended.
4
We tried to have a table in the restaurant but it was fully booked and thus we decided to have our dinner “outside” the restaurant in their bar, where you also can dine. The environment is absolutely outstanding and unique, really the best you can dream of. Also the service is friendly and fast, but… The food was not really up to the standard of the rest, and that is why I give just four points out of five. The beef was tough and tasteless, which spoiled the otherwise good feeling a bit. However, I will surely try this place again next time when coming to Singapore as the environment, as already said, is outstanding
4
Pollen is a very nice restaurant. Food is delicious (some plates even too fancy - i had the short ribs that melted in mouth), location/ambiance is very nice (located below the flower done) and good service.Was so offered a tour of their spectacular kitchen and met the scottish chef ( don't remember his name but very nice).I recommend Pollen for special occasions and/or if money is no object
5
Booked Pollen for an early Valentine's Day dinner with wife. Great food, great ambience. Can't help noticing practically every table ordering the same starter (Hokkaido scallops), and mains (beef ribs and Norwegian salmon), and desserts. Food was delicious, staff were friendly. Took the $60 dessert offer which came with 2 desserts of our choice, a Moscato and some sweets. 2 feedback:- staff to speak slower when introducing the dishes. With no disrespect to our foreign servers at all, it's hard to catch the accent when they speak too fast. Also I don't really blame them - as I told my wife, given that every diner orders the same dishes every night, it's not hard to introduce the dish without much thought....- this 2nd feedback I told the staff myself. Before the appetisers came we decided to roam the flower dome before the night turned dark. As we exited the restaurant to the flower dome, we smelled a strong stench and realised that it was the fertilisers and manure used in the pots placed directly outside the restaurant. If guests were to enter the restaurant from the roof terrace or the flower dome, it will not be a pleasant entry at all

This restaurant is a gem - top notch service ! Service was excellent ! Every detail is looked into - fron offering pashminas to female guests who may feel cold, to explaining every single dish to patrons, to attentively looking out for patron. Food was amazing! N so were the desserts :) the staff even offered to bring us around the kitchen! We enjoyed a kitchen tour and complimentary entry to flower some after put meal. Only thing is, wish there was a diaper changing station in the restaurant toilet. However, not a big issue as other public toilets at gardens had full facilities for nursing room n diaper changing.

Food is great, great ambience, but too fussy. Many little bits on a plate which are interesting, but gimmicky to give Singaporean diners a different experience. They use foam, for example, which was 'passe' in the UK a long, long time ago..
5
If you want a fine dining experience without the bill shock, opt for the set menu lunch. We both chose different courses throughout and all were delicious. I recommend you accept the pashmina on offer as it is a cool temperature room. Service was excellent and the complementary exit walk through the flower dome was fantastic. Great value overall.

The afternoon we visited the Flower Dome, the pollen terrace had people at approximately four tables when we were seated. We enjoyed the quietness of the place and took in the surrounding plants and herbs. The restaurant felt a bit like an oasis, refreshing us after being in the crowds in the dome. Our food arrived rather quickly and was delicious. The cocktails we ordered did not arrive at our table until after we had eaten. They were good and strong and very creative, but we would have preferred them earlier.

As a Londoner I have dined in Pollen Street Social in London and the cuisine is very similar, fine dinning but this time with an amazing setting. Very romantic and perfect for a special dinner.Food is what I refer to as modern British and ingredients sourced from a far, sad not to see any local seafood on the menu but execution of all dishes was to a Michelin Star standard.Great experience and worth a visit

They have affordable high-tea sets although the servings are small. What is great about this place is that you can take their buggy service into the restaurant which means free entry to flower dome
5
This was a wonderful experience. We went for lunch on Sunday and got admittance to the dome afterwards. Food was innovative and creative. Beautifully presented. Modest portions -so not ideal for the big appetite people - but rich, flavoursome and filling. Price reasonable for the quality of food and high standard of service - watch the wine list unless you are fully adjusted to Singapore wine prices! Bit chilly so take a shawl or jacket. Temperature lovely in the dome for westerners needing some respite.

We had our anniversary celebration today at the Pollen. There was a free buggy service from the entrance of the Gardens by the Bay to the restaurant. The restaurant is inside the Flower Dome where we also had complimentary entry. The starter and main course was a 8/10, but the desserts were just divine 10/10! We had the strawberry short cake and the Banoffee Pie. Yum! We also had a complimentary anniversary dessert so be sure of telling the wait staff any special occasion that you are celebrating! Will definitely go there again
5
We had the set lunch menu. The food was very nice and the price (for the menu) was very reasonable. The rest of the menu was pretty pricy though. The temperature in the restaurant was about 20 degrees (same as the flowerdome) which is pretty cold when you're sitting down for a few hours. Service was great and it didn't take long before we got offered some scarfs to keep warm. We were taken back to the carpark by buggy. Loved it and would go there again!

Visited restaurant for the first time with my family (child and an infant too) to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were there to dine early as I was with an infant, service was good generally. Lovely ambience as diners get free access to the gorgeous flower dome whike waiting for your appetiser. Husbamd had the beef short ribs. It was fantastic. Temder and yet flavourful. I had the sea bass which was average. The restaurant was thoughtful in cooking my 6 year old some good 'ol tomato pasta, which was yummy too! We offered the chef a glass of the wine we were having to complement him on a job well done on the short ribs dish......pity we did not have the honour of meeting him....would have been a nice icing to a lovely family birthday meal indeed...
5
Located in Flower Dome, it offers a great and quiet refuge from the surrounded area. The food is average with good selection of wines and fair price. Great place for a romantic lunch.
I will visit again when in Singapore.

I went there on a Saturday evening with two adult friends. We chose the Pollen Tasting Menu and were certainly in for a fine dining experience. This gave us 8 courses, mostly small servings and delivered with great presentation. The chef threw in some additional course surprises as well. My main was the Pigeon - fermented grape gel, spelt risotto, red Sichuan. The dessert was the Banofee Pie – Dulce de leche, banana, hazelnut, coffee. Eating was a leisurely experience with plates and cutlery removed after each course. The hospitality and the service was top notch. They did bring some great warmed bread crispy edge with garlic infused butter as a permanent side to hold us over between meals. Heaven. The wine list was extensive. We chose a Shiraz from Margaret River in Australia. Always a good choice. The environment was amazing. Pollen is located in the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay and sitting through the meal in the indoor dining space you are surrounded by lush green. Added bonus at end of the evening was a quick tour of the kitchen and meet the chef. Worth a visit but save up your money as the experience does not come cheap. With the tasting menu, one bottle of wine, a delicious herbal tea, we paid $280 each (includes 10% Svc +7% GST

We went to lunch there on Boxing day after reading and hearing good feedback from diners, not disappointed, but I feel it is better to go to any restaurant with an open mind as too high an expectation can cause some disappointment. We had the special lunch menu with a choice of entrees, mains and dessert. Service was very good, we were served lovely warm bread with different spread which were delicious. I had a salad which was refreshing and I could eat more! We both had the barramundi which was decorated nicely, had a crispy skin served on top of the fish, unfortunately the middle of my fish was slightly underdone and so I could not eat the rest of the fish, the other serving was similar. The flavour of the main dish was rather bland ! The best part of the meal (!) was the desert, when we ordered the apple pie, we were informed that the pie was a deconstructed apple pie, we did not know that is was deconstructed so well that when they served the pie, all that was on the plate was some clear gel spread on the plate with a scoop of cream fraiche, which is supposed to be smooth and creamy but was ice hard, in the centre of the plate, scattered with some small hard pumpkin cubes and some crumbs! we all made a joke that they must have lost the apples when the chef was deconstructing the dish. The master chefs always say presentation is important, but taste is the ultimate ! My other guest was luckier, the al carte menu was very good and she thoroughly enjoyed her selection of foie gras pate as entrée which was delicious , tender quail for her main and a well constructed dessert ! .The service was very good and you are even offered a pashmina if you are a bit cold as the air-conditioning was on full blast. Another plus point for the restaurant was the free entrance to The Flower dome which was very beautiful with many exotic plants from all over the world, cacti from USA ,flowers and plants from Australia etc. An interesting place to visit

Flying from Bangkok to Singapore for lunch at Pollen in Singapore’s Flower Dome was certainly not a usual lunch affair but having heard of Jason Atherton’s Pollen Street Social in London; it was a trip worth checking this place out.Needless to mention; in old fashion our Thai Airways flight took off with 30 minutes delay from Bangkok, calculating travelling time to Singapore, Immigration procedure and a taxi drive to the Flower Dome will give us ample time to meet our table reservation at 12:30. Arriving at the Dome, we immediately set on a short ride with Pollen’s own Buggy to the restaurant, right on time! We were sat down on a lovely table by the window, overlooking the garden, Champagne was offered by the sommelier and we settled for a Rose to start off our lunch. By then we noticed the cold climate but brushed this away since we came from the tropical outside of ever-humid Singapore. While waiting, we were trying to get our phones onto the house Wi-Fi that was unsuccessful, even with the help of the waiting staff. Bread service was served to start off; steamed buns with Gorgonzola, Sour Dough Bread with Garlic Butter and Seaweed and Hummus. (By then we discussed again the cold climate in this restaurant and agreed it was not us) The buns tasted nice, even though to a size of a 10 Thai Baht Coin, however the Sour Dough Bread was almost uneatable; thick crust, more like three times re-heated, was rolling in our mouth just to soften. 1/3 left on the plate uneaten. The Garlic butter could not be much of help; it appeared home made, crumbly and lack of garlic. Hummus was lacking on acidity and had by far too much of Tahini. (By then our hands where loosing feelings due the cold climate in this restaurant)Our first starters where served consisting of Carpaccio of Hokkaido scallops, cucumber and finger lime sago, frozen dill water, caviar and a Harvest festival Foie Gras, Gingerbread, pumpkin and blackberries. The scallops dish tasted pretty nice and its appearance looked colorful with lots of green, however my Fois Gras with Gingerbread, Pumpkin and Blackberries looked rather miniature, the homemade cider did not help much! Gingerbread was cooked, I guess in an microwave and stone hard, it even sprung off my plate onto the floor as I was trying to attack it. (By then the manager assured us that they have no control to the cold climate as the temperature is from the Flower Dome. Flowers from Europe require a cold climate?!)C, my lunch partner, mention by then that here in Singapore service is pretty much laid back compared with Bangkok. Huhh? Laid back? No, absurdly slow and inefficient I would correct her since it took almost 20 minutes to get our main dishes served. I had time for a smoke and I was directed to the front entrance of the restaurant, into a corner, looking around me, three signs saying S$ 500 fine for littering, S$ 100 for smoking and another sign for littering more but no ashtray or bin in sight. Well, I am not paying any fines here in Fine Singapore for sure! (By the time I returned to my table, my hands regained full function again and my blood circulation was intact, again)Main dishes served consisted of Jasmine tea cured Norwegian salmon, Artichoke barigoule, mandarin, Ikura caviar and soft shell crab, a Loin of venison, beets, berries, pears and juniper salt. The salmon was perfectly cooked, under a dome of some foam but could not taste any Jasmine tea as much I tried. The loin of venison could not have been more than 80-100 gram, three miniature slices with lots of other stuff. By then it occurred me that this must be a new type of cuisine which escaped my radar previously; minicular cuisine! Nothing to remember off. (By then I had a fear that any minute the ceiling may cave in and cover us in a blanket of powdery snow, in Singapore!)We by then gave it a final try and ordered the desserts just to wait for another 20 minutes or so to get first my espresso served and way after the desserts.Deconstructed, minicular Banoffee Pie, Dulce de leche, banana, hazelnut, coffee and Poached pears, Hoegaarden ice cream, cocoa rice paper, shortbread, vanilla lemon parfait, both desserts lacking in taste and presentation. Hoegaarden Ice Cream could have been anything than Hoegaarden for that matter. S$ 405 later, we were out of this local freezer Dome, just having enough time in taking a taxi ride into the city to view the Singapore Merlion in the Singaporian rain, but at least in a tropical climate without fearing of frostbites! Then off to the airport on TG 408 back to Bangkok. Yes, you guessed right; with another 30 minutes of delayed departure. Good old Thai Airways; you never surprise me

Not expensive, given the really great food. The staff were excellent. Aircon is quite severe so ladies may need a cardigan, but the restaurant will lend a light shawl if needed. The food was simply delicious - we will certainly be going back often. The only reason for docking a star is that on a Saturday you may have the misfortune of a Chinese traditional drum band performing in the arena above the restaurant. If so you will be subjected to an appalling banging and screaming noise which renders conversation impossible for minutes on end. It's not the restaurants fault, but it is a severe drawback. You may wish to check ahead if this will affect your chosen time
5
A great experience. From the ride on the little buggy from the entrance of the gardens to the restaurant. to a great 3 course lunch special at $55. Bright location in the greenhouse with a view of Marina Bay Sands. You can slip up the stairs and see the massive 'World Flower' display. Interesting food options where they match flavors you think wouldn't work but they do! Not for the in-adventurous but a great experience for every one else. I have been here several times and the food has always been great

We went for coffee and cake break there with an oversea friend after walking around the garden. we expected a certain standard as we have been to number of michelin star restaurants in England. there were a number of tables available so we were seated quite quickly. we ordered slice of chestnut cake and pumpkin cake with 3 hot beverages. It was a job to get the waiting staffs' attention. the drinks were served to us and i got given a dirty cup for my tea. I mean dirty! it was stained badly from the previous drink it contained. it was all around the cup and yet the waiter didnt see it. after we pointed out the stain the waiter removed the cup without even apologising. I then asked for some milk for my tea but it took over 20 mins to arrive and after asking 5 different waiting staffs (including the manager!). the cakes then arrived which i must say, they look pretty, but thats it. they dont taste of either pumpkin or chestnut. very underwhelming. For the price we pay, i do expect better service and food. All in all a very disappointing experience and they are certainly ruining Jason Atherton's name

When visiting the fabulous Gardens by the Bay we decided to stop for afternoon coffee at Pollen in the Flower Dome. This was our most disappointing dining experience in Singapore. The service was the worst we experienced in Singapore on our 8 day holiday there. It took 45 minutes for a luke-warm cappuccino and small slice of cake to arrive, the cup of tea and rest of the order was not delivered. We waited another 5 minutes then decided it was not worth waiting any longer. The $25 SG bill for a very small coffee and cake was overpriced and the service was terrible. If wanting a coffee or a snack whilst visiting the Gardens, don't bother with this café, much better service and value at the Super Trees Dining Restaurants. Here we found friendly and prompt service and tasty food - unlike at Pollen (a supposedly upmarket café)
5
We have visited Pollen many times for lunch and it has never disappointed. Uniquely Pollen always has a new surprise in store with it's menu and we love that fresh produce is used from the gardens. It's always very memorable for our guests and going for a walk in the Gardens after lunch (free entry when you eat at Pollen) is the perfect way to end a meal! I recommend getting a seat near the entrance to the gardens as you can smell the flowers; wonderful! The menu offers a great value set lunch but we are always pulled to the a-la-carte. Stunning presentation of every plate. Wine list is fabulous and not too extortionate by Singapore standards for a restaurant of this caliber. My only critique would be the desserts - although spectacularly presented - unfortunately fell a bit short in the flavour department.Perfect place to take friends for lunch that are visiting out of town for a unique experience! Highly recommended
2
We were willing to splurge on a good meal to celebrate the holiday, but the portions were small, especially the beef, which was a la carte. The barramundi, part of the set, was tasteless, and the dessert (apple pie deconstructed) was just miniscule pieces of apple, drops of sauce, with a teaspoon of ice cream. Only good dish was the Salmon. Spent $380 on 2 set lunches (3 course), and 2 mains.
5
Very nice place for a couple or small group
Very nice design of meals, and excellent quality of products
2
We were a table of 9. This enabled me to see or taste a bit of everything as well as to hear the comments of my table companions. The room was absurdly cold, I can still feel the effects of the frozen draught on my stiff neck. The shawls eventually provided only for some barely helped. Inevitably they ran out of shawls; even a penguin would have asked for one. Service was plainly incompetent and painfully slow from beginning to end. Virtually everything was wrong. This is the fault of management, staff can be trained. It took over 20 minutes to get water! Shouting at a whole table to announce dishes is not pleasant to listen to nor elegant to see. These announcements were very loud and yet incomprehensible. Food quantities are small and thought is only given to appearence. Some nibbles were delightful, but many dishes are just decoration rather than food. At this level overcooked seabass is unacceptable. Some dishes are not warm: this info should be on the menu. The desserts were all underwhelming. The price charged for 4 little pieces of cheese should afford a mature cheddar rather than the cheapest one on the market. Toilets are spotless and even colder than the room. Summing up: not a pleasant experience

Was delighted to come here for lunch as a birthday treat, recommended by Singaporean friends. Lunch here would be my top choice for any foodie, with unmistakeable Michelin-star quality food at lunch prices which are a steal in this expensive city: SGD 55 for three courses and SGD 15 per glass of (excellent) wine. It was nice to try the Insolia, far more multilayered than most affordable Italian whites.Leaving aside the freezing temperatures inside (the staff were extremely apologetic and provided shawls and hot water), every aspect was perfect. Hot crusty bread and a pre-starter which mixed Asian and European techniques and flavours set the scene for the delights to come. Every element of the foie gras starter was beautifully prepared and the chia seeds, calamansi and other ingredients came together in a perfect harmony of textures and flavours. My friend assured me that the vegetarian option was among the best he had ever had and the mushroom spelt barley main was outstanding. The dessert course was a slight let-down, as the deconstructed Black Forest with its sad cocoa soil had no pronounced flavour of cherry or chocolate and lacked any unctuousness you might expect.However, when the staff heard that it was my birthday, they bought out one of the most delicious concoctions I have ever experienced. A small birthday cake of a rich chestnut mousse resting on a cardamom sable biscuit with a just-chocolately enough glaze far outshone everything we had later that day on the dessert tasting menu of Asia’s Best Pastry Chef. I would come back to Singapore on my birthday for this cake alone!The staff kindly invited us to see the kitchen and meet the Sous Chef, Angelo Rosso. His pride in his kitchen – with all the standard gadgets: Pacojet, sous vide, thermomix, indoor bbq etc. – was palpable. The kitchen was far larger and better staffed than similar sized Michelin restaurants I have seen in Europe. Maybe this is a factor in producing such exceptional food
3
I guess my expectations were bit high considering the pedigree of the chef's. Service was above average. The ambiance was so so considering the unique structure it resides in. Btw, we thought it was very cold inside to a point we had to order hot water to thaw ourselves. We ordered the fixed lunch menu. In short, everything was just ok from the starters to dessert
3
We went there for dinner with my sister and her family. Setting of restaurant is very nice, as one would expect from a restaurant of this standard. Food was good but nothing exceptional, especially for this price range.What dissapointed us was their service. We had two children in our group. Although they were good enough to have the chef prepare a pasta dish for the kids, they didn't bother to provide any of the the amuse bouche or chef's extras in between courses for the kids, who are old enough to appreciate fine dining food. Since the mains took quite a while to arrive, the kids were of course famished and wanted to try the amuse bouche, which we had to divide and share with the kids. The waiting staff saw us doing this, but instead of bringing some for the kids, one waiter commented that the amuse bouche wasn't meant for the kids. Come on! It wasn't as if we didn't order mains for the kids! Their inability to be flexible to keep customers happy reoccurred when they kids wanted to have some of the macaroons on display for dessert. When we enquired on this, the waitress told us that the macaroons weren't on the dessert menu (as they were meant for their bar) and therefore had to check with the chef. To their credit, they served us the macaroons but by this time, the special family meal didn't feel quite so special anymore. This restaurant should decide to either implement a no childrens policy or ensure its staff is trained to serve customers with kids. Considering where it is located, it is inevitable that some customers will bring kids along.One other point, the waitressing staff explained the ingredients of each dish but had such strong Singlish accents that I couldn't understand them, even though I am from a neighbouring Asian country.Having been to Pollen Street Social, this restaurant is nothing like the one in London. So if you choose to go, you have to lower your expectations
3
The setting in the flower dome is interesting, but makes it very cold this month, which we did not know. Thankfully the restaurant had shawls, so that was appreciated. The ambiance is so-so, and the restaurant lacks the charm of Pollen Street Social in London, or the elegance of City Social. At 9pm on a Saturday there was a large family table with two babies...so this decidedly ruined the atmosphere. The food presentation was excellent, and the food was delicious, but we just wanted to leave. The staff are lovely but for the price point, it is unfair to other diners on a Saturday evening to allow small children. Lunches, teas and early sittings are fine, but not late (same policy as at most fine dining establishments)
3
Can't complain about the food quality, but service-wise1/ took 20mins for any bread/amuse bouche to arrive 2/ ordered a glass of wine and the waiters completely forgotten about it until half way through the main course and upon prompt3/ ordered coffee during dessert and they bring the bill with no coffee instead4/ ordered hot water for the table and only two out of four came, need to prompt. The mug has lipstick mark on itI would expect much better from a restaurant of this calibr
5
It was a birthday treat for my husband and first time to Pollen. We were amazed with the hospitality and the service. The food was well thought out, good variety, well prepared and served. We enjoyed every bit of our food. There is an extensive wine list but the staff are the stars, hard working, charming and polite. I would strongly recommend anyone to visit POLLEN.
5
Enjoyed high tea at Pollen within the fully air conditioned flower dome. Surrounded by nicely sculpted gardens and beautiful flowers, it is an amazing experience. Service is excellent, food is exquisite and tea pleasant, the only complaint in the overpowering smells of fertilizers within the enclosed space. Pricy but this is expected from the fine restaurant
4
Yes, it is pricey but what you get when you visit POLLEN is a high end dining experience comparable to anywhere in the world. There is a sense of opulence to this establishment which is reflected in the excellent food and the fine service. The cheese selection is quite exceptional
5
Pollen is such a beautiful, unique location with exquisite food. You definitely feel transported to another place - a magical, delicious place!
2
If not for the Flower Garden the Pollen isn't worth paying a visit. It's expensive middle-of-the-road fare.
5
The best fusion food I've ever had. Foie Gras for starter Salmon for main dish Service excellence!!! Got a chance to see their kitchen, super clean. Fresh ingredients. Master chefs. Located at Garden by the Bay..have a nice walk around the area.
5
Second time at this haven inside the flower dome for the great value set lunch.
Fantastic food, great setting and spot on service
We will be back...

Visited on a recent trip to Singapore and had the incredible tasting menu. Love the delicious and interesting food combinations, and the stunning presentation. Definitely a must visit! Full review at http://wanderluxelife.wordpress.com/2014/11/01/pollen-singapore/

The high tea here isn't the best that I've had, but when you consider all the factors together (location, food, service), it was quite a lovely experience. Food portions are on the smaller side so I didn't leave Pollen feeling extremely full. This may be an issue if you are the type who appreciates value for money. You are definitely paying for the location more than the food. Saying that, I loved that high tea was set inside the Flower Dome. It's a unique location and I loved being able to walk through the Dome after high tea
4
I was there for my birthday dinner that my husband booked. The atmosphere of the restaurant was good even though it is a tad cold but the restaurant provides scarfs for guest which I think that these little actions is thoughtful. The food was great but for people who have not tried their 3 selection of cheese before, should enquire on the type of cheese that is being served.Overall, the service and food was great and value for money
5
We came here for a business dinner last week. 4 of us chose the tasting menu and the other 2 had the vegetarian tasting menu. As with the Pollen Street Social in London, we had several amuses bouches before even reaching the starters, an encouraging beginning. Each course was a revelation with amazing blends of taste (my only minor gripe being the molecularly restructured foie gras - quite honestly I would have preferred the real thing!). A highlight was the desert amuses bouches - mini Magnums with homemade hazelnut ice cream inside and the most amazing petits fours, including a 'lollipop' which turned out to be passion fruit cheesecake.The flower dome itself closes at 9pm but you can wander up into it from the restaurant any time up to then. We witnessed a spectacular thunderstorm the night we were there. There is a buggy shuttle to and from the main entrance to Gardens by the Bay but it is only a few minutes walk, which is necessary after such an extensive meal!Not a particularly cheap night out (the dinner tasting menu is S$190 per person) but well worth every last cent in my opinion
4
The food at Pollen is meticulous and beautiful - visually playful with occasionally surprising flavors and satisfying portions. In a three course meal for two, there was only one dish that wasn't the same standard as the rest, - not bad, just not as good as the others. It's expensive, but we're in Singapore, so that is to be expected. Service is also fantastic and we were also treated to a tour of the kitchen. Highly recommended
5
We were strolling through the flower dome at the Garden by the Bay and noticed this restaurant. We started off with a specialty cocktail and white wine. Then we had a delicious salad then shared a hearty serving of linguine. The manager ( Amir ) took time to make sure that all his guests were well taken care of
4
We visited the flower dome and found this place. We ordered some tea to have a break and rest away from the crowd. It is a very nice and good place for a few quiet moments before heading to the cloud forest.
5
will go back again. really enjoy their foods , drinks n the atmosphere there. suitable for bday celebration n gathering . value for $$

I had a dinner at Pollen on Thursday night, Iberico as starter and seabass with main course. No wine that day. Unbelievably, I started to have serious diarrhea since Friday morning. More than 15 times within 24 hours time! Fever & dehydrated.Just came back from clinic and doctor said most likely the cause is from the restaurant as I only eaten 1 meal within 8 hours before my 1st diarrhea. Thought numerous times but I still can't find any other reason of my diarrhea other than the meal (most likely to be the seabass).A fine dining....

I’m an avid Jason Atherton fan, having visited all of his London restaurants on many occasions, so this had a lot to live up to. And, wow, did this place deliver! Upon arriving at the entrance to Gardens by the Bay we were greeted by a chap in a golf buggy to whizz us over to Pollen. As it’s based in the Flower Dome, upon entering the restaurant we were asked if we’d like to go straight to our table or head into the Flower Dome (no cost) for a look around. We opted for the latter – a quick 20 minute walk around was enough to take in some of the loveliness of the place (not dissimilar to Eden in Cornwall) whilst building up our appetite for our food. Service in Singapore, I have been advised, isn’t great, there’s a general lackadaisical approach (apparently). Well this wasn’t apparent at Pollen - the staff were an utter delight throughout the whole meal. We opted for the 7 course taster menu (it seemed rude not to) which kicked off with the most amazing starters (including my favourite, cheese macaroon). Highlights included carpaccio of scallops served with frozen apple and wasabi, seared foie gras, beef short rib and the poached pears with Hoegaarden ice cream. The sommelier was fantastic – advising us very well based upon our likes and dislikes, so much so that we ended up with aperitifs, a bottle of red, a dessert wine and then a Pedro Ximenez sherry. Needless to say, it was a good job we could hold onto the buggy at the end of the night! My only two small comments to note are 1. it can be a little cool in there (as you are within the Flower Dome) so dress accordingly, although they do offer pashminas to the ladies) and 2. Later on in the evening, we could hear the rumble of what sounded like trolleys overhead as the Flower Dome staff tended to their plants. Neither detracted from our experience but are worthy of note.If you love your culinary delights and are happy to pay for it (this restaurant is expensive but by no means over-priced) then Pollen is a must visit in Singapore

Possibly one of the best things about Pollen is its setting. For the course of dinner you forget that you are in a big, sweaty humid city, and you really feel that you are in a peaceful garden retreat. Not something to be undervalued in busy Singapore. Of course, the bonus of having free access to the Dome makes it all even better.To be fair, the food is good too, though nothing extra superb. Having eaten at Pollen Street Social, I still prefer the original London restaurant. This one is quite different in style and food. We had the tasting menu which was good quality but didn't offer much innovation or unseen combinations. It was worth the visit and a lovely experience, but it will be the setting drawing me back, not the food
4
Went for random tea time, was my third time, as i really love the ambience and good place to sit and have a good chat with friends over tea or even a cocktail at 3! Good selection of small bites, savoury and sweet things. Good presentation!
4
Brought overseas friends here, with the free Garden Dome entry as an incentiveSeated, the waiter asked still or sparkling. I always wish they would add a 3rd option - water from the tapOrdered the tasting menu. The 2 amuse bouche were ok, didn't blow me away yet. The 1st starter of scallop carpaccio was ok, and the 2nd course of consommé was a disappointment - barely any soup!The waiter also came by and offered truffle shavings and we politely declined!The foie gras was ok. The salmon main was a slightly larger portion. But the beef brought us back to tiny portions againThe 2nd major disappointment was the dessert - a chocolate dish made to look like a forest. A similar dessert created by Tippling club is much betterOverall , the dishes also took a long time between courses. This $190 tasting menu can be better i fee
4
We had the tasting menu and the beef short rib is definitely a character to mention! I can imagine going back just for it! Go earlier so you have time to visit the flower dome which is lovely and complementary if you dine in Pollen and visit earlier so you get to enjoy it, although it closes at 9pm, we went for a quick walk at around 8pm and it was too dark to enjoy the flowers.

I brought my team to celebrate a great achievement. They deserved a special, fine dining experience, and Pollen was recommended. Overall, the experience was mixed.The great stuff: food offerings are adventurous (nitrogen frozen starter - I think it was the scallops carpacio - , aerated foie gras, jasmine tea flavoured Norwegian salmon), free glass of quality champagne or white wine to welcome the guests, elaborate explanations of each dish and great ambience which included free access to the flower dome. The good dishes were excellent, which included the various starters and most of our mains (the Norwegian salmon, beef short ribs and the Welsh lamb). The not so good stuff: the sea bass was disappointing with its mushroom broth just a bit too strong, which was a shame because 2 in our group ordered that. The logistics on both ends was very disappointing. The website told us a buggy would come by to the pick up point at Gardens by the Bay every 5 minutes. We waited for over 20 minutes. When we tried to call the number on the board, a recording said the call could not be connected. Worse, when we were about to leave, we asked them to book us cabs - which is pretty standard in Singapore - and the response was that there was no need as the buggy would take us to the taxi stand and it should be fairly quick to get a cab. I asked them if they were sure it would eb quick and they confidently responded in the affirmative. Well, we were brought to the closest cab stand, which was the Marina Bay Sands hotel tower 3, where the queue was snaking beyond the lobby area. So we walked across to the Marina Bay Shoppes and the queue there was even longer. In the end, our group had to wait close to 45 minutes to finally get a cab. The least the Pollen staff should have done was book the cabs to the Gardens by the Bay taxi stand, and then let the buggy take us there. Despite all that, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and each other's company, even if the evening ended on a bit of a sour note.I would hesitate to return unless they addressed especially the logistics matter

This is a fine dining establishment that we dined in after spending two hours of enjoying the Garden By the Bay in Singapore. We were a party of 11, with 5 children and 6 adults. The hotel made the reservation for us. Notwithstanding that it does not has a kids menu, the chef put together a couple of pasta meals for the children (ages from 6 to 13). The menu was French Asian fusion and the food was exquisitely presented. My son and wife selected The Tomahawk, a full rib eye steak for two. It was a memorable presentation - accompanied by an Argentinian Malbec Red. We noticed the extensive use of foam based sauces and when the head chef dropped by to say hello, I enquired whether he has been influenced by the cooking of Hestion Blumental. To our collective delight, the young French chef said that he spent a number of years working for Hestion in London.Despite the fact that we were not dressed for fine dining, the services were excellent and the children were well catered for to keep them amused. Very well done.Visitors with the time should do what we did. We visited the Gardens in late afternoon to avoid the heat and wound our way to Pollen for a memorable fine dining dinner. Then strolled to the Marina Bay Sands for a few drinks to top off a great holiday to Hong Kong and Singapore

Visited The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay and decided to try the bistro of the Pollen restaurant there. Because of the controlled environment it was superb to eat there, as if having lovely spring time weather in Singapore! We tried the steak and the seafood risotto. Both were very nicely done. Menu is limited at the bistro, not a lot to try. But what we've seen hopefully means more can be expected at the restaurant. Pricey though even at the bistro

Singapore has wonderful food, but they often blow it by trying to out-Europe the Europeans. The result is terrible. The food here was very ordinary, massively over priced and it seemed more about being seen in the right place than having quality food. Don't go for European or American food in Singapore, the local stuff is much bette
5
The food is very good. I tasted the aerated foie grass (I am a fanatic when the menu has liver on it, I will always take it) and the pan seared foie gras. The sommelier made the difference, he advised a nice somewhat sweet wine with the course, it worked out perfectly. My advise: let him decide what to drink with your meal, I was not amazed, you will not be disappointed.edwi
5
The menu is very 'Heston Blumenthal' and is a taste experience.The setting is in the magnificent Gardens By The Bay. The wine is superb and the waiters knowledgeable - unusual for Asia - the only thing to worry about is the bill...but it IS an experience..

Mum and I had a lovely lunch at Pollen whilst in Singapore. The service was outstanding and also the food. We had the lunch set menu which was great value. They were also very accommodating with my mum as she is lactose intolerant. As an added bonus you get into the Flower dome for free which is just under $30AUD and also there is a free shuttle bus which can take you to and from the front entrance of the Gardens by the bay
2
We placed our order for food but after a considerable wait it was not forthcoming though patrons arriving after us were being served before. Our drinks arrived promptly but the food order had been overlooked! Staff need to acknowledge customer's presence before they feel they are a hindrance and leave! Which happened on two occasions while we were waiting! Better organisation needed
5
We had a fabulous meal in Pollen last week. We opted for the tasting menu which was delicious and exciting visually, with wonderful textures.The walk round the Flower Dome before dinner was a lovely start to the evening.We were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable price for a special meal, would highly recommend
4
Overall service experience was good. There was a person standing ready just above the car park to ferry us to the restaurant by Buggy, and throughout, staff was attentive, friendly. Food wise, quality was pretty decent, but creativity stood out, considering the touches (frozen apple ice chips poured onto scallop carpaccio, for instance). Environment was interesting with a nice enough view. Will return
5
Firstly, any michelin starred/recommended restaurant that welcomes a diner who is dressed smart casual and in flip flops without frowning and turning us away is rare and pretty amazing.Secondly, the food was just rediculously clever with a beautiful blend of SE Asian and western cuisine whilst incorporating the flora and fauna concept as it is housed in a giant flower dome.Finally, the service, staff and chefs were very friendly and not arrogant or condescending at all. The usual problem you have with Michelin featured restaurants are snooty staff that insist on wine choices and getting the most spend out of you but Pollen felt welcoming, warm and non-evasive. They even gave us a lift in their golf cart back to our place and the manager was very chatty along the way :)All in all, 10 out of 10
3
Had the $55 set lunch here on a Saturday. The place was beautiful with its location in the Flower dome at the Gardens by the Bay. It offers complimentary access to the flower dome which is highly recommended.The food presentations were all well done but the taste was either bland or nothing exciting. You would have gotten similar looking ones but taste better at either Jaan or Restaurant Par Andre.Service was up to standard.The cappuccino was great though but a pity there was no petit fours
5
Set in the Gardens by the Bay. Lovely view. Impecable service. Food does open your eyes and tastebuds....great compliments of flavours and design on a plate. Only complaint? ....Touch cold...Aircon is just too cold and not only that....food doesnt stay warm for long.
2
Ordered a latte, carrot cake and mocktail. The service was pretty slow. Supposedly a latte but came a cappuccino and it wasn't warm at all. The carrot cake was so-so. Staff wasn't attentive and as a result I had to walk to the cashier to foot the bill. Overall, the ambience is romantic. (Of coz, it's Flower Dome) everything else just average and not value for money.
5
We ordered the Set Lunch and they can accommodate to my dietary requirement! Suitable for vegetarian too! Some of the food were presented with some flowers or plant that I've not seen, pretty and very unique yet delicious. They will tell you what's on the plate upon serving you, but somehow the set meal won't leave you feeling very full. Loved the ice-cream, wish they can serve bigger scoop. Don't expect fast service in serving you the food, so just relax and enjoy the view outside while you chill in the cold restaurant.If you want to walk-in to this place looking "cool" and poised on a sunny afternoon, would advice to take a cab and drop off at the Main Entrance as that's were you'll get the complimentary buggy ride, which will drive you right to the door step of the restaurant. Walking from mrt to the buggy pick-up point was quite some walk under the heat, making you pretty drenched.Next best thing from eating here is the complimentary access to Flower Dome, which is a pretty way to end your lovely date. Then after that, you can walk to MRT, or MBS for early dinner :
5
We enjoyed the entire experience, from the buggy ride to the restaurant, to the attention during the dinner, being shown all the ingredients in each course, and most of all the time spent at the dessert bar watching how they make the creative desserts. The executive chef there was friendly, knowledgeable and witty and both pastry chefs engaged us throughout. My hubby had a memorable birthday celebration there and all the staff went out of their way to ensure that
5
The menu was refreshing and the food well presented. The service was good - if a little too attentive at times. The wine list was excellent for the food and good advice. The venue was great but was cold due to the rain storm during our meal. Would recommend for a long lunch or dinner - great setting
4
The food quality was very good and the presentation was as you'd expect in a higher end restaurant. There was a good selection of wines and the sommelier did know his stuff. There was also a very good cheese board which is fairly unusual in Singapore.Take a cardigan or jacket though because the air conditioning was set to arctic!
4
We brought some friends from overseas to Gardens by the Bay and wanted them to try some good food since we were there, so we decided to choose Pollen. The ambience was very classy, and the stewards were friendly. The chef did not disappoint; although some of his inventions took some getting used to, we loved the food he created. The side benefit was that we could go view the Flower Dome FOC after lunch. The experience was great, but cost us around $500 for 6 pax (no alcohol ordered). I would certainly go again, but only for special occasions
4
The service and the food in this restaurant is fantastic, it is a fine dining restaurant, so it is quite pricey, but you get, what you payed for. Everything we had was just divine, especially the dessert.... It is very cold in the restaurant from the aircon, but they offer the ladies a pashmina scarf to put on the shoulders. Without that our dinner would have been quite uncomfortable... It is set in the Gardens By The Bay, so you may go for a walk in the gardens before your dinner
5
My husband and I had what really was a perfect evening at Pollen. It started with a buggy ride up to the restaurant, followed by a looksee of the flower dome, complete with prize winning orchids as part of the expo. Our meal itself had many highlights from the delightful sommelier's top notch wine recommendations to superb pork and lamb main courses, which followed interesting and unexpected amuse bouches. Before coffee and excellent petit fours, we happily accepted the offer of a visit to the kitchen where we enjoyed chatting to Colin about life at Pollen and in Singapore. This was not just an excellent fine dining - it was a truly memorable experience. Thank you to you, Colin and all your team - we will be back
5
Sits beautifully inside the flower dome. It's a great place for a fancy lunch or dinner in Singapore. You can get into the flower dome for free if you got a reservation in the pollen.The food is very unique and the presentation simply beautiful. Got to admit that some of the dishes taste unique since there's a few ingredients on my plate that i've tasted for the first time. But it present an adventurous experience in a good way. The chefs are either michelin star or award winning. They also throw a lot of unique events like wine pairing, wine tasting and guest chef menu. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Ask for a recommendation and they knows their product well. The pollen is one of the best dining experience we've ever had.If you want a taste of the pollen cuisine, try to order their menu sampler for one pax and have your partner order one extra appetizer and main course. It should be enough for the both of you
5
The terrace was beautiful and romantic, and my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the food as well. :)
4
Food is great. It look like art. Atmosphere and taste is good. But some dishes served late. Menu was different with on line wite. 
5
The decor is elegant yet simple enough so as not to be OTT (Over The Top). Overall nice cool ambience in part due to the flower some. (Having said that, a walk around the flower dome after or before the meal is highly recommended - good photo ops!) Service was great and the food was fantastic. My must-try recommendation would be the Tomahawk Steak! Pair it with a good wine and the day or night would be just so much better! Worth the visit but a little hefty on the wallet.
4
We ate out on the upper floor veranda where it was like eating outdoors with air-conditioning. The herbs and vegetables come straight from the in-house garden. We shared focaccia and olives with chicken liver parfait and bread
5
Really lovely experience. You get picked up in a golf buggy at the entrance to the gardens and driven though this magical place to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Service good and friendly. You have the option to explore the dome but we chose not to as we were hungry!Food was really great, with good vegetarian options. Of course, it's pricey, but I think it's worth it. I'm not one for instagramming food, but I had to take a photo of my main course when it arrived as it was so beautiful
5
Difficult to find the words to describe our diner at Pollen. We had been told by Singaporian people that this place was great but it was far from the truth. This place is simply unique, unbelievable and magical. The place where the restaurant is located first : Garden by the bay. As I would love you to descover the place the way I did, I won't describe it. But get prepared to experience something fantastic. I suggest to go there for dinner as the atmosphere is even more special. Then the food : I would compare it to a 2 stars Michellin and say that it is the best restaurant we have been in Singapore ( and we have done a few, the Jaan included). Last but not least the staff: perfect, from the people welcoming you to the somelier and the waiter. Special thanks to the chef patissier : an American guy who can surprise a French couple fan of good food ... No need to say more ... And that I strongly recommend to finish your dinner at the dessert bar . I hope this place will remain as it is for long. We all need magic in our life

Visited pollen over the weekend for a birthday celebration. There is a buggy pick up available from the visitor center which is very convenient and enhanced the experience even before entering the restaurant. Loved the warm welcome from service staff, the interior decor and ambience. We ordered the 3 course set lunch, at $55++ which was very value for money. The food is an interesting mix of ingredients, very creative and tasty too! The service staff was very attentive throughout the lunch and for every dish that was served, the staff will give a quick introduction so we know what we are eating. Special mention for the dessert! Definitely live up to all the hype. Ended the lunch with a cake surprise, complimentary of Pollen for the birthday boy.While getting the check, one of the staff asked if we were keen to have a quick tour of the kitchen. We said yes of course! Checked out the upper deck as well, a more chillax cafe/bistro style. Would love to try out the high tea menu over here next time! And a trip to Pollen is not complete if you do not visit the flower dome, good for taking a stroll after the great lunch experience.Highly recommended for special occasions. Thanks Pollen for the wonderful birthday experience :

Perfect from start to finish. Picked up by the Pollen buggy from the car park we were taken to the restaurant for what turned out to be one of the best meals we've had in Singapore. We went for lunch which was an absolutely bargain at $55 per head. Freshly baked bread, hummus and I think seaweed butter to whet the appetite. To start we both opted for the cured swordfish, fennel, grapefruit nitro and toasted seaweed starter. A bit of theatre with the grapefruit nitro with a light and fresh burst of flavours. Delicious. For mains we had a beautifully cooked duck dish and red snapper with squid stuffed with black paella. I'm not doing it justice at all. Desserts were perfect. Staff were very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. To top it all we met the fabulous head chef Colin Buchan. And if that wasn't sufficiently special we found out that the meal comes with complementary access to the flower garden.We had the most wonderful lunch. Couldn't have wanted more. The only thing to be mindful of is the temperature in the restaurant which is determined by the air conditioned flower dome. A little cold but of course the staff had a selection of pashminas from which my wife could choose. Thanks for a wonderful lunch
4
Good and Beautiful food, great service staff, but kitchen need to beef up on the service. Our dinner took 4hrs which is way too long! We had lunch here once when they just opened, I like the lunch menu better
5
After checking into the Marina Bay Sands we were so hungry! After looking on TA we found Pollen was close by and looked great. Yes, yes and more yes! We were greeted by the hostess who informed us there were two choices for lunch, the set menu or the Terrance menu which was more geared towards tapas with a few mains. We opted for the set menu which was $55 a person which included a starter, (3 choices) a main, (3 choices as well) and dessert. (Also, 3 choices) I had the beet starter, my boyfriend had the swordfish, we both had the duck for our main and the ABC for dessert. The beet starter included golden beets with a beet sorbet, dotted with horse radish purée, on a bed of olive "soil". This was a masterpiece of deliciousness! My boyfriends swordfish was like butter with anise and other flavors dancing all over your pallet. The duck was out of this world, cooked to medium perfection with a prune purée and grilled onions. We were invited to the dessert bar to converse with the pastry chef, Alex, while he created his amazing plates. Alex kills it! The milk chocolate mousse, which he created is something I would give up my kidney to enjoy again! The white balsamic ice cream was incredible along with the beets marinated in Apple cider and the apple marinated in the roasted beet was as complex as it was delicious! There was a fried rice pudding and carrot ball with flavor that wouldn't stop. We had a glass of wine to enjoy with our meal which was a great compliment to it. The service was outstanding, the staff very attentive and the experience was enjoyable
2
We popped into Pollen for a cheeky afternoon cocktail whilst exploring the flower dome. Mid afternoon and the place appeared relatively full, a quick wait for a table whilst they rearranged and found us a table. We simply ordered three cocktails, each came out 10 mins apart....not together. This meant that by the time mine finally arrived, one had been finished and the other who'd waited for mine to arrive turned into an icey slurry. Overall a highly disappointing experience. The fastest thing they served was the bill
5
I ate here for dinner this evening, and overall it was a great experience. I opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was several set courses, plus some extras. The canapes and amuse bouche were excellent. The first course, which was heirloom tomatoes, was decent, but I was a bit put off by the celery sorbet. It overpowered the tomato flavor, which should have been the highlight of the dish. The second course, carpaccio of scallops, had great potential. The scallops alone were fantastic, with great citrus flavor and perfect texture. All the other stuff on the plate kind of took away from that. The third course was foie gras, and I am not really a fan of foie gras in the first place, so I'll reserve my opinion on that one. The fourth course, salmon, was maybe one of the best dished I've ever had, ever. With this dish, everything on the plate made sense. There was a lot going on, but every forkful combination I tried was a revelation. I loved it. The fifth course was good (pork), but it would have been difficult to impress me with anything following that salmon. Then I was invited to the dessert bar to chat with the pastry chefs and have my dessert. There were four courses of dessert. For someone with a sweet tooth like I have, this was heaven. It was all amazing - I'd say the best part was the turmeric sorbet in the Thailand dessert.It's a nice touch that they invite you into the kitchen for a tour and to meet some of the chefs
5
This is one interesting restaurant besides great food. Before even getting seated, you go around wander around the air-conditioned flower dome (S$ 28.00 entrance) for free. Besides the meet and greet the chefs, instead you get invited to visit the clean and awesome kitchen after your meal
2
My husband and I visited for Sunday lunch and opted for the fixed price lunch offering, maybe that was our mistake or maybe we should be grateful we didn't waste any more money on a la carte meals. All three courses were very disappointing.The food looked attractive, although very small, but there was a distinct lack of flavour to any of it. My main course was particularly bad-I had skirt steak which had not been cooked properly--it was chewy and unpleasant and I left half of it and I know that I was not the only diner to do so.We have eaten lunches at restaurants owned/run by top chefs on many occasions and have always been amazed by the presentation and blown away by the flavours. Unfortunately at Pollen, it was only the presentation which was interesting-it seems that too much effort was put into the presentation at the expense of flavour. As for finding a piece of mushroom in my dessert, I was lost for words! Maybe the chef was having a bad day or on holiday, since there seem to be lots of good reviews on here.The service was inconsistent, highly attentive when offering drinks, but very slow to take our orders and to bring out and clear our main courses. When I left part of my main course, the waiter asked for 'feedback' but did not apologise and seemed unconcerned.We were very disappointed. There are much better places to eat in Singapore
5
I was here for a business lunch and I loved this place - setting in the Gardens by the bay is second to none (you get free entry if you eat too), and the food was amazing. I've eaten at some amazing restaurants around the world and this would be up there with the best. Would be a perfect place to take a partner.
4
We had the $55 lunch, what great value. Pretty food that tastes delicious, you can't go wrong. PS:the restaurant leads onto the Flower Dome so it saves you an entry fe

Thanks for taking the time to read our review. To give you some contact we've lived in Singapore for 6 years now, and are always on the lookout for everything from local snack to fine dining. On this occasion, we chose Pollen as it was C's birthday and we ALWAYS celebrate in style!!! Ha ha!We're trying a new format to our reviews so please let us know if this works better for you or if you prefer our original format in the comments or PM us! We always replay!SETTING/AMBIENCEThe setting in the relatively new Gardens By The Bay is nice. A Pick-up "golf buggy" runs about every 10 minutes or so, which is handy when it rains (as it often does here). It would be quite a walk from the main taxi area to the restaurant otherwise.Externally and internally, the place is really quite great. Do try and get a table by the windows, as when it does rain, the cascading water is lovely to watch. There's lovely small garden boxes which add to the feeling of being outside, but inside also. NOTE: The tables when we visited were angled such that one has their back to the window, and the other looks toward the outside.The tables are well spaced, and the nice touches of small "footstools" for the lady's handbag or man's manbag are a nice touch. Ambient noise wasn't much of an issue for us, however it was only about say 50-60% capacity when we were there for a mid-week lunch. The general decor is really quite pretty, and with C having some experience in design, was quite impressed. Seats are comfortable (a problem for P being tall) and lighting is fine. Glasswear, tableware, were fine, but one minor issue was the knifeware - that could be improved - but hey, clutching at straws with that (P is a silverware fanatic so no downgrades!).SERVICEOverall, very good. However, as we write this it seems a little strange to say that. There were times, and this is actually fairly typical of most places in Singapore, that wine and water don't get filled as often as those of us who grew up in the west would expect. It's not a big issue, as once a quiet word was had, they started to look more at the table and expedited the top-ups. Again, no big issue - but be aware you may have to ask them to keep an eye if you are tossing down the water (or wine!) quickly.Food service was to be expected. Pollen isn't inexpensive, so we were hopeful that the food service would be good. It was. The staff knew the dishses, and when asked about certain dishes (do look up their menu - it's quite different - you're not getting your standard fare here) - they were ablse to explain in DETAIL about the composition, the tastes, textures, and nuances. Which brings us to the...FOOD ITSELFWow. Restaurant Andre in Singapore has always been the go-to place for the most interesting and innovative cuisine, in our two little opinions. Pollen is giving them a run for the money there. Vegetarians will be happy, as long as you also like seafood, but they have a full-on veggie menu if you want that also. As we said, you don't go to Pollen for a steak or club smmich. This is really interesting food. REALLY interesting. It's an experience.Will you come away hungry? Maybe. We doubt it though. We lasted a good 3 hours (no time limit on lunches, by the way, although one always has to be polite and respect the staff, right!) and after one standard set lunch $SGD 75) and one entree and main (total for that $SGD 85) and a cheese platter ($SGD 25) we were well satiated. PRICESNot unreasonable. They publish their menus with the standard pricing so, really, not that bad. Wine is pretty reasonable given some of the selections.WOULD WE GO AGAIN?Yes, on occasion. Given the innovative menu, it's probably not going to be a place where we'd go every month, but for a good special occasion, or if you're a visitor to SIngapore, then definately worth a look. We were told that you also get a day pass to the whole area by being a diner there.AND FOR YOU SMOKERS OUT THERE...Yes. You can dart outside and hide in a little area to take a puff of joy as required. Of course, just not inside.C & P RECOMMEND IT FOR (Besides the TA recommendations)If you have foodie friends looking for a nice afternoon, then spend the morning in the Gardens By The Bay - ask them to organise you a table and see if you can swing the free passes (NOTE: We HAVE NOT tried this but were told that it can be arranged through Pollen). Then go and have a nice, interesting lunch, and shoot back to the airport.Yes, if you have a day layover in Singapore, you can EASILY do that.Hope this is of use...see you on the next review...C&P Travelling! CAVEAT ON PHOTOSSorry everyone, we think it's a bit nasty to take photos INSIDE a restaurant of food. Hope you don't mind

What a disappointment. PSS is always high on the list of to go places when Im visiting London, sadly the Singapore restaurant is somewhat of an ugly sister to the bold London institution. Service is horrendously inconsistent. At times arm waving is needed to grab attention, then 15 minutes later we are getting hassled throughout of main course many times weather the food is up to our liking. While the food is good, to share the name with its London counterpart, I maybe being a little unfair and biased, though with the reputation that PSS London has, the Singapore version falls short. Undercooked lambâ€¦.. seriously?
4
What a gem. Hidden in the gardens near Marina Bay Sands. We went to this restaurant by chance and found it delightful. Service excellent. Food was great. The duck was beautiful. Great selection of cheese. Some of us had desert and that was equally as good
4
I regularly visit Pollen street social in London. Its one of my favourite restaurant. Being in Singapore I tried Pollen. The place is really nice (Flower dome) near Marina bay sand. The restaurant is located inside the glass pavillion with plants and flowers. It was not very cosy maybe but quite original. I didn't like the service. It was the worst thing here. We were waiting too long to be served from waiter and sommelier side. The wine was served after we'd started to eat our starters. Usually in restaurants they serve wine before food. Dirty plates were on our table quite long. We even asked smb to take them away. Staff was not friendly at all.Food was nice. Original and tasteful. So thanks the chef for it. Obviously I am ready to submit with bad service if food is excellent but the harmony is much better
4
location - Gardens by the Bay, a long walk if they had no buggy servicepremise - nice and classy, white washed walls and sleek design, it was a good posh feelfood - posh nosh basically, it is French so the portion were meant for birds and were not meant for sharingstaff - uber attentiveprice - expensive; to impress or celebrate or have business dinner
5
I love a good special occasion restaurant and what is even harder to find is a great special occaison restaurant that caters well for vegetarians. Now, I dont mean vegan or gluten free or anything like that- just a place that does meat-free dishes with as much thought as the meaty ones. Pollen is such a place.My husband and I had a degustation menu that was varied, beautifully presented, fresh and innovative and it just happened to be vegetarian. Anything not so good? Well not the food- but you might think of turning down the arctic air conditioning just a touch.Congratulations Pollen...well done. And I'll toast you another glass of that wonderful champagne we drank along with the dinner
5
Really great food, the scallops were amazing best iv ever had, the only downside is the price its really expensive, but the atmosphere and food are brillian
5
Pollen is one of the best occasion restaurants in Singapore . The location within Gardens by the Bay is stunning . The menu is modern but not "try too hard " , the wine list is extensive and varied within price ranges and service is the warmest and most professional of any of the better restaurants , staff are there when you need them but sense when they are not required and stay away . Get there early for a drink and a walk around the stunning flower dome 
3
Midweek celebratory dinner, 8 diners, table in the centre of the restaurant. Started off with an enjoyable walk around the cool and beautiful Flower Dome. Sat down with a wine list where every glass was >$22++, most bottles of anything >$110++. Ok this place is not value for money with respect to alcohol, but this is Singapore.Food was an interesting menu, modern nouvelle cuisine. Lovely tastes, some dishes better than others. The Ras el hangout injected duck breast was tasty but comprised only chunks of duck on the plate, compared with other dishes. The "Country Duck" had little visible duck, all "edible soil". The Hokkaido scallops were great, but the sea bass simple. The 8 diners had a variety of opinions, some flattering, some equivocal.The service bordered on utilitarian. Staff spoke warmly to us and introducing dishes with some flair; they also filled our glasses regularly. But the kitchen took 3 hours to bring out 2 courses, by which time we were over dessert or coffee. In the meantime, the waitstaff had to be flagged down for everything. Considering the high-value upmarket nature of this restaurant, having to waving down staff for every $200++ bottle of wine, only to be told to wait for the sommelier, who turned up 5-10 minutes later, seemed neglectful. They then only had one bottle of each wine available.It's a lovely looking restaurant. The meal was slow and drawn out; the food did not stand out enough to justify the $200++ per head it cost us
5
Really lovely, 5 star resturant. Meals are nouvelle cuisine and may be a bit small and "weird" if you don't like that sort of thing. Loads of freebies (bread, amuse bouche and petit fours with coffee) I loved it, artfully presented with interesting flavours and ingredients. attentive service. we had house wine only and no coffee and the bill was $172 SGD each. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and they sent a golf buggy to pick us up ( it was only about 2 mins ride but great fun) A lovely way to celebrate my 44th birthday
5
Probably in the Top10 of Singapore dining venues. Pollen is perfect for a lunch gathering: affordable lunch set, creative food and free access to the Flower Dome to stroll around after a good meal! For more: http://www.mouthfool.com/2014/05/pollen

A fantastic fine-dining experience. Slightly difficult to find but worth the walk. Atmosphere and ambience was subdued on the night we went - good for dates but not larger parties. Fantastic service and not too overbearing despite the lack of customers. The food was very good and the flavours were delicate and well considered. Excellent presentation. The overall themes tied into the location (within the botanical gardens) strongly. Did feel that there was pressure to take the recommended wine rather than have the freedom to choose from a wine list. Was rather expensive as expected - about £190 total for 2 people but only one glass of wine each and 3 courses
5
Truly attentive service and a menu which was most unusual. Canapes to start with - delicate flavours and unusual textures made for a unique experience. A Main of Steamed seabass, tomato confit, red pepper tartare, stuffed courgette flower, lettuce velouté - superb! An offer of a cashmere stole as the restaurant can get chilly, a visit to the kitchen and a talk with the chef, through to organising the shuttle whose driver kindly dropped me at nearby Marina Bay Sands. A wonderful evening
4
The service we received was great! Food was also great, and the chef was nice and happy to talk to. The ambiance was great as well
5
For a city that consistently under delivers in hospitality service, Pollen was as though they were competing with the best in New York, Paris or London. I'm surprised the reviews are mixed, maybe we had a lucky day, though for our experience we could not fault it. From the simple gesture of providing a small stool for my large camera bag to their continual attention to my mothers coeliac dietary requirements, we found the service to be excellent. I recall mentioning my mothers coeliac dietary requirement when making the reservation though only briefly. It was as though they had been waiting and fully prepared. Not to forget the food as it was excellent as well. We opted for the set lunch menu which we felt was good value
4
We came for tea and saw the colors change from day to night. Sitting in the casual area, we ordered tea, mocktails, red wine and gazpacho. Plus calamari fritti, and desserts. While waiting, we wandered in the grounds and took photos of the tulips in Flower Dome. More friends came to join us, we then tried the linguine puttanesca. We were all served canapes and a shot of watermelon elixir.Then it rained outside and the lightning provided a whole different lighting experience.Food did not disappoint, we found the prices reasonable and the while treat just a great one

The best thing about pollen is its setting, right smack in the middle of the Gardens by the Bay. An added bonus is that you get to visit the gardens for free after your meal. Food is good but portions can be quite small for the price

The restaurant is about 15 mins walk from the ticketing booth, a buggy will pick you up to create that warm hospitality. For me, I would preferred to walk in the beautiful Garden By The Bay to enjoy the landscape and fresh air in the evening. We arrived at the entrance of the resturant which look like a loading bay. The table setting is very close to each other, privacy a challenge if you want an intimate experience with your love one. The presentation of the food is creative, but the taste is ordinary. I felt guilty not able to finish my main dish (I wonder why resturant serves men and women the same amount of food, when one is visibly larger than the other?). Our service staff is inexperienced in handling fine dinning and spoke in an inaudible fashion. Dinner for two on Valentine's night came out to be S$330 per head (wine pairing S$340++, normal S$200++, and strangely coffee and tea are not included in the expensive package. We paid an additional $11 each for a cup of Machiatto, which left a bad taste in our heart.) I would recommend to look for other options in town if you are planning for a romantic dinner. May be their 'normal' operations is fine

We visited Pollen for Sunday lunch on Mothers Day. I phoned in advance to check they could cater for special dietary requirements - "no problem they said and all in the fixed menu price".The restaurant picks you up from near he visitor centre at Botanic Gardens in a little buggy - nice touch. The setting is great and looked like a nice place to enjoy a relaxed and enjoyable Sunday lunch!We'd arrived a little early so were asked to go into the Flower Dome and have a walk before coming back at our booking time, which we did.Ordering our food:We ordered for our boys first, a simple pasta in tomato sauce, and for our younger son a plain pasta with butter and broccoli on the side. They got his secod order wrong twice before finally getting it right on the third attempt - An hour later, and our starters hadn't even arrived!!!There were problems in getting a suitable main dish - eventually (after speaking to three people) the manager arrived and suggested an option (Soup and roasted artichoke with ... ) after consulting with chef. It sounded good as main course, so we said yes.The starters were magnificent, with wonderful flavours - but portions quite small. When the main course arrived - it was a very small bowl of clear soup with 4 small pieces (tangerine segment size) in it with a few other things for flavour and garnish. Great taste BUT NEVER a main course!!!Dessert was poor, tiny serving and the colourful combination of half a dozen or so ingredients did not work. The ice cream the children ordered, a scoop of chocolate and other a scoop of vanilla were very nice. But again it's probably the smallest scoop they have ever had served!Overall - nice starter, nice main course and great coffee. Was it worth what they charged NO! We left still feeling hungry, the delays in getting a simple plain pasta with butter, and the fact they were unable to confirm whether the ingredients were actually suitable for vegetarians was just unbelievable!Wouldn't recommend it

OK, it is a little tricky to find. We wandered around for a while trying to find the shuttle until a lovely man in the visitors centres took us down to restaurant. It is a the far end of the flower dome at the new Gardens by the bay. It was worth it! The meal and service were extraordinary. The initial amuse bouche were perfect, the meals were just delicious. A waiter came around with a pashmina and asked if I'd like to borrow one in case I was a little cold. (It was a little chilly being situated in the dome) They served the best bread I've ever tasted with pecans in it and served it with garlic butter. I'm attaching a photo of the scallops. You can't quite see, but they serve it with frozen apple. But the best part was the dessert bar experience. When you order dessert, they ask if you'd like to move to the dessert bar at the front of the restaurant to watch your dessert being made. This was such a fun thing to do. Fiona and Adam were amazing, friendly, showed us every aspect of the dessert, answered questions, supplied yummy little treats (like home home magnum ice creams - to die for!) After dessert, they brought around a trolley with fresh herbs and served herbal teas. There was an amazing cheese platter. All in all, an unforgettable dining experience. Highly recommend you try it if you are in Singapore

My husband and I were lamenting the impending demise of the Au Jardin restaurant in Singapore's botanic gardens and so he booked Pollen as a special night out. Dining at Pollen is not just a meal, it is a whole experience, from the moment you get on the restaurant's golf cart at the Gardens by the Bay. The cart delivers you to the restaurant, but if you go, don't sit at your table just yet. Make sure you have time to explore the Flower Dome first. The restaurant is actually in the Flower Dome, one of the two huge conservatories at the Gardens by the Bay - a truly spectacular position. A lift takes you up to the dome level and you can have a drink at the bar there or just walk around the amazing garden under the glass. The bar serves unusual cocktails, fairly aggressively priced, but then you are paying for the location, I guess. I would describe the food in Pollen as Mediterranean/Asian fusion meets Heston Blumenthal. A glance at the menu gives a sense of what diners are in for and the end result is beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. The amuse-bouche dishes and wonderful bread that preceded the main event were spectacular. My husband began with the aged beef tartare and I had the poached lobster tail with squid ink. Both were like a painting on a plate and although the portions are not large, both dishes were satisfyingly rich. My second course, the steamed sea bass, was disappointing. This was entirely due to one of the components, which provided me with an unfortunate textural surprise, although I'm sure other diners may have welcomed it. It was dried fish scales, a handful of which featured in the dish to give crunch, but I could not tolerate the mouth feel. Our waitress immediately offered to replace the dish, but I was quite full by then, so I declined. The incident was very well handled by the wonderful maître d', Layla, who was a professional and attentive presence in the room throughout the evening. Previous reviews have commented on the slow service, but that was not our experience at all - the pace was just right. All in all, a close to perfect experience, marred for me only by the fish scales in the main course. Pollen is a top class fine dining restaurant in a spectacular location
4
We had an informal supper in the Bistro section upstairs which opens out into the Flower Dome. It's a very pleasant setting, but bear in mind that the temperature is driven by the temperate climate in the dome, so it's fairly cool. I had a duck salad followed by a steak sandwich which were both very pleasant. The steak in the sandwich was not huge but was very tender and flavoursome. My wife chose the deep fried baby squid which was delicious. The service was friendly, but fairly relaxed. There were only two tables ocuupied when we were there so I'm not sure how they would cope when they're busy.We certainly intend to return and based on the quality of the food upstairs we're keen to try the main restaurant downstairs
3
I read prior Tripadvisor Reviews on Pollen and expected service to be slow. It took us well over 2.5 hours to finish the tasting menu, and we skipped coffee. Just having amuse bouche took quite a while.The food is ok. Some of the dishes look interesting. I will post some of the photos. I have been there once and I think that is enough for me. I would rate this restaurant average
5
Everything in this place is perfect: from the tasteful design, service, polite and competent staff to the wonderful creative meals. Small details such as offering ladies pashminas or fresh herb tea from a trolley full of pots of mint, basil and dill are exactly things that make a restaurant stand out. Big applause and bravo to this restaurant
5
What an elegant modern setting, nestled under Gardens by the Bay. The food presentations and execution is perfection. We were delighted in so many ways with our meals. There are several elements of surprise with each coarse. Allow room for dessert as well. The pastry chef California transplant really puts her heart into it
5
By far one of the best restaurants of its type that my wife and I have ever experienced, from the time we were delivered from the taxi drop off to the restaurant, right through the evening. The food was beautifully presented by very attentive waiters and the taste of all course and appetizers was exquisite. The price was a tad high but well worth it
4
We recently went to Pollen and I had the Vegetarian tasting menu which was SGD 120 for seven courses, in addition to canapes, bread and chocolates. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of the meal! Each course was small, intricate and beautifully presented. As a vegetarian, I'm used to the same old dishes time and time again, but the food was really varied, interesting and delicious. Certainly some flavour combinations that I've never experienced before.At the end of the evening we were offered a tour of the kitchen, where we got to see the chefs preparing the beautiful meals. We found it fascinating to watch. Then a golf buggy dropped us back to the taxi stand at the end of the night which was a fun touch!There are a couple of improvements this restaurant could make to get 5 stars including:- While the service was very professional and helpful, it was a little slow at time in between courses. However we weren't in a rush and enjoyed savouring each course so it didn't really bother us, but expect it may irritate others.- I found it really cold in the restaurant, although they do offer pashminas.- At the end of the meal a trolly came around with hot water and herbs and we were offered a fresh herbal tea. We didn't think too much about it and assumed it was complimentary. However they did charge us SGD 14 for a very small pot of boiling water and a couple of herbs, which I found excessive.Overall a really wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend the restaurant to others for special occasions
2
The French say "jamais deux sans trois" - after having been ripped off at the high (Tatsuya's) and low (Nam Nam Noodle Bar) ends of the Singapore dining scene, I felt the same here, in the middle end. The environment is pleasant (although a bit cold), and the food OK (albeit not as good as I would have expected from a restaurant in this category), but service is erratic and slow. Overall it's terrible value

New Years Eve is always a test, a full restaurant and a complex tasting menu. We thought Pollen did very well, We loved the imaginative menu and how it was served. When we saw fois gras on the menu we didn't expect a piece the size of a steak!It was a menu full of surprises from beautifully presented lobster to a smoking de-constructed Eton Mess style dessert. And, afterwards we could retire upstairs to their bar in the dome for our own private view of Singapore's New Year's Eve fireworks.The only hitch was at the beginning when they thought we were part of another group but once the staff realized we were moved to a quiet corner for a memorable NYE
2
We came into what must be the more casual restaurant on a recommendation from a friend, so we thought we we good to go. From the beginning we could see that they were understaffed but both of the two people we could see there were working hard - one man bussed 5 tables, sat 5 sets of people, delivered some orders and took others. We even complimented him on how hard he was working, often an uncommon sight in Singapore restaurants. While it took a few minutes longer than it should to get our menus, we understood. We placed our order and then waited.... an HOUR to get our food. There are only three main courses on the menu, so we were perplexed as to the wait. People who came in after us were served before us. Our kids were really hungry when we came in, so the wait was unbearable. It was only after we asked after our food did the gentleman offer to help us out in some way. He was lovely and offered us a drink on the house which we really appreciated but our meals were nearly eaten so we declined. The food was very tasty (good food quality) but given the price (Expensive - a coffee is $9, soda $6, meatless pasta was $24, a very small portion of friend calamari was $17) AND the wait... I'd not go back
5
Brilliant evening with taster menu and excellent wines to match. Setting wonderful within The Gardens on the Bay and with door to door transport offered without charge. And a Scottish Chef for some good homeland banter
5
This was a lovely end to great trip over Christmas and perfect birthday treat. On Arrival, after a lovely trip through the gardens on a golf buggy, we were greeted by the very pleasant receptionist who informed us we could visit the dome garden, and come to our table when we wanted. After a stroll around the rose garden/Mediterranean garden, we were shown to our table with a fantastic view of the Singapore big wheel and light show. The staff were very attentive and courteous, and helpful with the menu.Food was lovely, well presented. Especially delicious was the homemade butter! Sublime.Fantastic extensive wine menu, albeit tad on the expensive side.Well worth a visit for that special occasion
5
We visited Pollen during a trip to the Gardens by the Bay and ate in the more casual second floor restaurant (we were too early for the main restaurant). My husband had a very tasty vegetarian pasta dish, which was nicely presented and well cooked. I opted for a cod dish, which was served with a stunningly good artichoke velouté. A side order of shoestring fries proved very helpful for plate mopping! Good food in a fabulous location
5
We were wondering around at new venture of Singapore called garden by the bay. After long day wanted to eat and have drinks. Suddenly started raining. We took a shade outside flower conservatory. We happened to be at the entrance of restaurant Pollen. We decided to have a look. Restaurant was just getting ready for dinner so we decided to try out for table. Friendly and most welcoming receptionist offered us window table facing giant Singapore wheel. Then came surprise canapés before that we started with champagne. Our server recommended us Silver tuna and tenderloin. Both dishes were beautifully presented and tasted even divine. For dessert we took JAAL. Our server recommended us cognac to go with it! We couldn't resist. WOW that's what I can say. Next time I won't wait for rain. Highly recommended. Kudos pollen.
4
I took my partner out for a special meal and the staff could have not done enough for us. The food was sublime and the service was very good. We went for a walk into the gardens after dinner which was just a perfect ending to our meal. Thank you again to all the staff
5
I didn't realise this gem in the Gardens by the Bay was here. As I just passed by we decided to go for a light dinner. The welcome was warm as was the experience through out the entire evening. The food superb and the staff friendly and attentive. It was not too busy but the staff made the night by giving my partner and I a tour of the kitchen.
3
With all the hype about Pollen and its London 'ancestry', it is a bit of a let down. The food is good, but FAR from memorable, and this may sound comical, but the portions sometimes are just too tiny to appreciate the quality of the dish! There is a lot of staff, but overall, service is slow and at times forgetful, or worse, staff are busy talking to each other and fail to notice customers requesting attention. As expected, prices are high (especially given the small or liliputian portions) although the set lunch is good value (in particular, considering that you get free entrance to one of the Towers). In many ways, there is a parallel with Au Jardin restaurant at the Singapore Botanical Gardens: Both are located on beautiful grounds, one mature and the other modern; both are housed in nice buildings, one colonial and the other contemporary; both have illustrous big brothers (Les Amis in the case of Au Jardin). And guess what? Au Jardin will close soon..

We went to Pollen restaurant in Singapore on 27 December 2013 and at that time we thought it was excellent dinner. I had Carpaccio of Hokaido scallops for my starter and steamed sea bass for my main course. To be honest I was rather surprised to see that my fish was uncooked in the middle, but I thought at that time may be it was the way it should be cooked especially in the posh restaurant.Unfortunately at night I have very bad food poisoning. I was really ill which was started at midnight by bad diarrhoea and followed by vomiting that lasted 2 whole hours. What a shame, it was very expensive poisons!! I do not know which one worse Carpaccio scallops or uncooked sea bass??

We were due to celebrate my wife's birthday at Pollen St Social in London. However a business trip took me to Singapore so we decided to try Pollen at Gardens by the bay. Earlier reviews had suggested that the two restaurants should not be compared. They were correct as the restaurants are very different. Earlier reviews have questioned the service levels. From a personal perspective I can only report the service was excellent. Our transfer in the buggy, the greeting by two staff members with umbrellas to protect us from the downpour, the service in the restaurant and the transfer back to the MBS were great. We had the tasting menu which was very good - not outstanding. The music in the restaurant didn't quite match the food which meant that it was an odd experience. I agree with earlier reviews that it is a bit pricey but then again most decent restaurants are. There was an absence of Singaporeans in the restaurant which was consistent with the feedback from my local clients - it's worth a visit but its not the sort of restaurant that you would rush back to unlike Pollen St Social

tried out this resto during weekday lunch and ordered their festive lunch menustarted off with amuse bouche which was quite good.Starters: seared silver tuna - small tuna chunks seared slightly served with carrot sorbet. personally i find that the tuna was kinda dry, slightly seared on the outside but dry inside, found out too late when i'm on my last piece of fish and ate the fish together with the carrot sorbet, and it was excellent! carrot sorbet without the greeny taste of veg, sweet and full of carrot flavours together with the fish its a good fit (still think the fish was rather dry)downside: found some egg shells in my appetizers, and alerted the waiter, they then offered me anything to replace, but i told them it was ok, so they eventually took the initiative to deduct some amount off my bill instead.Mains: ordered bronze turkey, the cut of the meat given was the tigh (i think), juicy, though i had few pieces of tendons that i cant even bite through and had to spit it out, served with pulled pork, not sure what was the seasoning on the pulled pork, taste salty with a kick(mustard/radish/wasabi?) the veg were done nicely, but the sauce for this dish, was not hitting the note for me, it tasted like soya sauce, like those chicken rice soya sauce but thicker.Dessert: was the winner for me, ordered the Tatin, its a "deconstructed" apple pie with every element done perfectly and taste amazing, they even mentioned that there's a garnish flower planted on the flower dome themselves.situated within the flower dome, it has nice view of the bay (partly) with very good ventilation (as it share the same of the flower dome, so it had to be cool). complimentary access to the flower dome as well for diners
4
An impromptu stop for a night cap after visit of Garden by the Bay ... It certainly didn't disappoint! Dessert "Jaal" was superb made of dark chocolate and oba (flower essence, how appropriately named when you think about it!) Actually the very friendly waiter explained that name of the restaurant and it's location in the Flower Dome is a happy coincidence! Regardless we will definitely come back for the full dinner menu!

pollen located in the amazing gardens by the bay has a great location.service is neat and attentive.food is also good but a bit expensive for what it is
3
Having eaten in pollen st social on numerous occasions I was exited to see what pollen would bring to Singapore. Unfortunately after 2 visits it falls very well short of it's London namesake. The first visit I could of forgiven as they had just opened, though on my second recently it seems not much has changed from the earlier visits short comings. Floor staff were rather intrusive and could at times seem quite cocky. Food was inconsistent, foie gras was great, pork belly was fatty and stringy. Such a shame to have such a restaurant that adds so much hype just by name fall so short of what it's London relation offers
4
We came across Pollen by accident, whist enjoying the Gardens by the Bay. We had I eaten in Pollen Social in London the week before so eating here was a must. So fortuitous as the meal and staff were nothing but excellent. I would go again and highly recommend it. See the light show first or afterwards to make this an evening to remember.The amuse bouchÃ©e were very tasty and the almond gazpacho very different, maybe one flavor too many. The lobster, meltingly soft and the quail the best I have had. My husbands pork was succulent . We did not have time for dessert but were brought some sweetly sublime petit fours. The experience culinary staff should be proud of what they have achieved. A negative comment the rough surfaced plates are ones I would change, and perhaps the multitude of flavors are overly complex.An expensive place but that should not deter those who delight in culinary experiences
4
It's certainly in a good position as it's right near the gardens
Much better than the large eating complex
We only had morning tea, tried two of their new deserts fabulous and the coffee was excellent
5
My First time dining at Pollen last week. Was not sure what to expect. I was wowed from start to finish! The staff are warm, attentive and friendly! To top off they accommodated my dietry requirements. which can be a rare. The food - Striking presentation and every mouth full just divine! I look forward to going back as I learnt they also serve afternoon tea
2
pollen tries very hard to be a special restaurant but fails on every count.Service is either patronizing or incomprehensible,the food is absurdly fussy and is simply not very nice to eat.Tthe prices are very high for a very limited choice which were all disappointing.The suckling pig was poor quality with accompaniments that simply did not work.We had to meet the chef who is a nice Scot called Colin but it was a painful conversation as none of us liked his odd mismatched dishes.The wine waiter was totally incomprehensible and patronizing at the same time-an unique attribute in my experience.I would urge you to avoid this place
5
Really enjoyed this restaurant. Top notch food. Had the pleasure of meeting the head pastry chef (I think her name was Miss Moore). She was very lovely and took the time to explain what we had ordered. I don't remember the last time I received that kind of one on one service. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant. If you find yourself in Singapore, looking for good food and great service, do yourself a favor and eat at Pollen.Bria
2
I know that this place has gotten alot of excellent reviews so I kind of feel bad that I don't have a very good impression of it. The ambience is probably one of the best in Singapore. Its surroundings is also second to none. The food however is very underwhelming - taste quality was below average on an absolute standard basis. Which makes it even more disappointing given that the price points are quite high. Sorry but I would highly recommend avoiding this place; with the exception of those who are primarily looking for exceptional ambience and would not mind below average food
4
We were invited to dinner at Pollen by friends and we all felt it was a wonderful experience. The service was efficient and friendly and extremely polite. All of the dishes were beautifully presented. For starters we enjoyed the Foie Gras and Carpaccio of Hokkaido Scallops. Mains included duck, red snapper and a glazed miso pork belly. The pork being the only dish that fell short of expectations. The strawberry dessert was another beautiful and tasty treat. Portions are small and prices are high, so be fore-warned; this is a restaurant for foodies and not a good choice for small children. They do have a more modest bistro menu in the bar area. Definitely a special occasion destination restaurant
3
My husband and I recently had a celebratory dinner at Pollen, we were excited to be going as we had read so many great reviews of both the restaurant and Jason.The service was excellent and we would definitely like to mention the Sommelier who made a fantastic recommendation. We decided since we were were celebrating that we would have the degustation meal. While we thought the portions generous, we really felt that the price we paid for this meal was not at all equal to the meal.Each dish was beautifully presented but some dishes were not enjoyed as we had anticipated. I do not usually do a review of a restaurant but I resent the price of the end bill and the expectations that were just not met
4
We had a wonderful lunch here recently in the most magnificent setting..the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. The staff were very welcoming and helpful & the food is creative & not only pleasing to the eye but the palate as well. The seabass was delicious and the Chocolate desert on the 'rock ' plate was a standout. ..all this while being surrounded by a lovely garden & attentive staff. The petit fours with coffee were a lovely finish. The pollen version of a deconstructed Tarte Tatin was slightly disappointing...the film was a bit odd but this did not detract in any way from a really memorable lunch
3
Sorry Jason, if this is culinary progress then I was disappointed.Best example of what was wrong was called Pollen Tatin, a deconstructed classic dish of Tarte Tatin was turned into culinary fiasco. An over-baked snippet of puff pastry with tasty but skinny julianne of Apple and a sweet teaspoon size portion of caramel ice-cream covered with a tasteless rubbery film that resembled clingfilm. Total disappointment and the result of trying to be too clever.Portion of pork dish was tiny but tasty and that's it. Tomato salad again had some taste but there was so much else going on, on the plate, that added little to the experience, yet the portion size was really small.All of our party commented on the tiny portions for all the dishes. All dishes were immaculately displayed but each one suffered from style over substance.Trying to be cutting edge has not worked here, I know Jason can do so much better
5
My Son and his lovely partner took myself and my wife here for her 60th birthday this October. I could not fault it for one moment, from the friendly welcome, attentive staff and superb menu, this was a treat we shall not forget in a long time.Next year is my retirement, maybe a hint to go there again to my son I think
5
This was my fifth visit to Pollen, so I am a fan, however it was better than before. Thus the second review.Two new chefs have taken the food up to another level and the service was exemplary. (Within minutes of arriving staff noticed that I was cold and offered an array of pashminas for me to choose from) Meal portions are perfect so you don't feel you are about to burst after having two amuse bouches, bread and three courses with wine, tea/coffee and petite fours. I was even invited to go into the kitchen and see their operations and meet the new chef. We had the set lunch which is fantastic value at $55++ for three courses. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants
5
Dinner reservations are difficult to get at this small restaurant. Two friends and I were fortunate to go there for lunch and actually, that is nice choice. First the location: Pollen is in the Flowers Dome of Gardens by the Bay, an exquisite, extravagant new botanic garden. You arrive by taxi, are whisked away by buggy to the huge dome/greenhouse, and deposited at the restaurant. The restaurant: sleek, modern, with a bit of of view of the bay. The music was Brasilian, which seems quite common in Singapore for some reason.The service: The staff is young, very professional, bent on giving you the best service (as I was putting my handbag on the floor, one of the staff rushed a small stool to put it on). I was early, so one of the staff suggested I go and walk in the dome and guided me through the back entrance into the luxuriant, colourful dome.The food: We had the three-course set lunch. You start with complimentary amuse-bouche and a mini-crusty loaf. The lightly garlicked butter is a perfect accompaniment. The food is modern and inventive without being too quirky.The clientele: From chic, young professionals to casual parents (with a screaming) baby. All are welcome
5
So much has been said about Pollen, which is set amidst the lovely Flower Dome at the stellar Gardens by the Bay, I wonder what I could add to it. My decision to treat myself to lunch there was one of the best decisions ever. Starting from the buggy ride to the restaurant, the entire experience was a pleasurable one. Opting for a glass of Billecarte Salmon rose champagne to begin with, the amuse bouches began arriving - crackling with apple & dijon mustard puree & arancini, little deep fried balls of truffled risotto. There was also warm sourdough bread with the most marvellous parmesan & seaweed butter. I could honestly just eat this alone.There is an excellent set lunch for $55++ but throwing caution to the winds, I selected from the a la carte menu instead. Starter was poached boston lobster with thinly shaved shards of fennel, grapefruit segments & cashews in a tangy tamarind dressing. Each plate that appeared was a work of art, almost too good to eat. My server alerted me to a special of roast suckling pig which I eagerly selected. What's not to like - crispy crackling with moist flesh & a slice of carmelised pineapple with a hint of five spice. I had not one but two desserts - the first was a quenelle of caramel ice cream sitting atop crispy puff pastry on a plate with a smear of creme fraiche & scattered with a julienne of granny smith apple. The whole covered with a gel of verjus. There was a wonderful mix of flavours - my only complaint was there it was such a small portion as to be non-existent. But then after a rich meal, that may be all you need. My second dessert was called Jaal - which was different textures of dark chocolate, served with a dark plum ice cream & served on a large rock!! Strewn with pomegranate seeds & puffed rice, this was also the most texturally interesting dish I was served.Kudos to all the waitstaff who were attentive & knowledgeable about the food they served. I'd love to return for dinner or perhaps another lunch. Who knows? It will be a special treat to myself

Recently came here for a friend's baby shower; although I've visited the Gardens by the Bay many times I hadn't tried any of the restaurants. Lovely setting and unusually for Singapore exceptionally good, friendly service. Food quality was very good, well presented and generous portions. A friend had placed the order but believe we had the standard afternoon tea with some add-on items eg. cheese, calamari - perhaps not traditional in an afternoon tea but absolutely delicious. They have their own salad, veg and herb garden which is another nice unique touch. Small details like regularly topping up water glasses - no complaints when we asked for iced tap water - really set this apart from other places.Enjoyed a walk in the gardens afterwards and the restaurant kindly looked after the flowers and gifts while we did this. Wish more restaurants in Singapore could do service like this. I can't wait to go back to Pollen - hoping that someone might treat me to dinner next time
3
For a dainty-looking little cafe in a major tourist attraction like Gardens By The Bay, and with such atrocious prices, you'd expect excellent service.Unfortunately, service was almost non-existent here. The place looked rather understaffed, with only 2 servers-cum-cashiers and 1 barista. Although the place is not huge, I could see that these 3 employees were failing to attend to all the guests in the cafe in a timely manner.I had to get up and go to the barista myself to place a simple order of just a few drinks, after giving up on waiting for the servers to come to my table automatically for orders.The drinks came reasonably quickly, but again we had the same problem of waiting when we wanted to settle the bill. It was nearly impossible to even catch the attention of any of the servers -- they were either huddled around the cash register, frantically getting orders into the system, or they were simply more attentive to the tourists of fairer skin (ie. Europeans/Caucasians).The sole saving grace came only when the manager appeared herself, and she was absolutely pleasant and prompt. Said manager is a Caucasian herself, so I say, shame on the employees for practising color-discrimination on their own fellow Asians, when their manager herself doesn't do so.If not for the fact that the manager left a wonderful impression on me just before I left, and that the cappuccino tastes great, I would've rated them a "poor"
5
We had a meal here on the last night of our holiday to Singapore for the F1. Having dinned at other restaurants in the group we knew what to expect food wise and it lived up to our expectations, great cocktails, fab meal, good service and in a beautiful setting in the flower dome.The restaurant and bar are cooled to 17 degrees (part of the flower dome) however the hotel will provide pashmina's for the ladies

After three of us had a wonderful time at Atherton at Table No.1 in Shanghai, we tried Pollen, in Singapore under the same Master Chef Jason Atherton.Firstly the setting is wonderfully different. This restaurant in Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful setting quite different from the retro-warehouse on south bund, with no views. While it overlooks the city and iconic in-town integrated resort building, the ride to the restaurant seems to take you to another world.The food in Singapore's Pollen is experimental and closer to nouvelle cuisine. We all chose the set lunches with different combinations of appetizers, main and desserts. At S$55, it seemed a great price as admission to this part of the park may set you back $20.The complimentary amuse bouche and petit fours aroused the most comments! Pork crackling, cheese balls and flavored butter - the butter was the best.For the mains: the Pork Belly was tasty but all fat, which provoked a discussion on pork fat and the okinawan diet.Pork fat is good fat and good for collagen, proffered the medical doctor in our group!She found her "bamboo steamed sea bass" browned but tasty. And the vegetarian found the platter satisfying with fresh and light flavors.My dessert was espresso sorbet, intense flavor but the serving was far too small for me. Others enjoyed the duo's of "something baked paired with something cold".The complimentary - petit fours at the end, chocolates in various forms brought the meal to a satisfying close accompanied by good coffee.Pollen's upstairs opens fully to the Flower Dome -flowers growing in profusion within this air-conditioned dome. Not the robust tropical plants but flowers from temperate climates.This corner of Pollen serves drinks and light bites, quite dramatic with understated decor. I had been here previously at sunset and enjoyed the transformation of city and sky colours along with champagne and oysters immensely.This area was pronounced suitable for an upcoming wedding -the solemnization ceremony before 50 closest family and friends. We look forward to a return visit

We were recently visiting Singapore and decided to have a meal at Pollen due to the positive reviews and how we read online that they cater for Gluten Free (GF) diners. We also booked because they advertised on their website an early evening dining special for S$90. The surroundings were beautiful and it was fun to be whisked along in their buggy to the restaurant, we arrived in good time so we got an opportunity to see the wonderful gardens. We then went back in and we were presented with the menu and wine list, we had booked early so we could take advantage of the fixed price menu although we were told that they would have to check with the kitchen to see if that was available as we had not selected that on the website, that made us feel particularly uncomfortable and did not set a good expectation of the evening ahead - the waiter then confirmed that they would be able to allow us to choose from the early evening menu. The next problem was the wine, it seemed that our normal tipple, a Sauvignon Blanc, was a problem with no wines available in the S$100-125 price bracket, I was surprised as normally the most reasonably priced wines are usually available in restaurants. Eventually we settled on a glass of red instead and started to relax in the ambient surroundings. Pollen had created some GF canopies which were well received, there was one GF starter (which was not what I would have chosen, but was ok), all of the other food was well presented and tasted great. My highlight was the Madras Ice Cream with Coconut and Banana.We were there on a Monday night and there were only 9 diners including ourselves, I think the Restaurant team could have been more courteous over our questioning around the Early Evening Menu and more apologetic over the out of stock wine. I think the Early Evening Menu was good value, however I would have been disappointed to have paid full price. In fairness towards the end of the menu, the staff did try hard to recover the situation and seemed to become more friendly

I wasn't disappointed with this restaurant, it lived up to its excellent previous reviews. We went there for lunch and had the set menu which had a good choice, food is Asian fusion. It was beautifully presented with some inventive touches. The taste lived up to its appearance.The staff were well trained and attentive and the surroundings were beautiful.The complimentary buggy service was a great touch as its quite a way from the taxi drop off point.With 2 glasses of wines, service etc the bill came to about S$125 each, expensive for lunch by Singapore standards but far superior to most of the competition

The afternoon experience at Pollen was truly indulgent- from the exclusive buggy ride to the restaurant to the reserved seating by the daisy-strewn trail with a stunning botanical backdrop to the Mediterranean-inspired tea spread and the rare choice of smoky Lapsang Souchong, and finally the complimentary visit to the Flower Dome filled with Mid-Autumn festivity
5
From the first to the last course the food and balance of the tasting menu was amazing, favourite restaurant so far,

Just went to Pollen at Gardens by the Bay last week for my birthday celebration last week. It was an experience that I truly enjoyed. The restaurant arranged for a buggy to pick us up from the Information Counter and sent us to the entrance of the restaurant. My girlfriend and I both ordered a 3-Course Set Lunch each which costs S$55++ and including 2 bottles of sparkling water and a pot of tea the total bill came up to about S$160. Most importantly, the food was cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable. I eagerly await my next dining experience here at this restaurant. I will let the photographs do the talking.P.S. Dining at this restaurant will allow you to have FOC access to the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay whose usual ticket price is S$12

Having been invited to lunch there, I wasn't sure what to expect. The golf cart transport was a nice touch to a place that is a fair hike from the taxi stand, but it must be easy to miss because other people at our table walked from the taxi stand. The food was great, and the lunch set menu reasonably priced - especially when you consider that you get free entry to the flower dome as well
3
The highlights here are definitely the presentation of some of the dishes. The ambiance is nice, and food was tasty but certainly not memorable for the right reasons. Food serving sizes for main courses resembled those one would expect for an entree. As such the meal was overpriced and unfortunately the taste and quality certainly would not see us returning

Went with great expectations but really, it was the desserts that saved our otherwise average experienc

Lovely restaurant with some of the best food I've had in Singapore. Comes with free entry to the flower dome if you go early enough. ( try lunch). I noticed one of the other posters complaining that it's difficult to find. That's not exactly true. It's only difficult to find if you fail to notice the exclusive buggy service that the restaurant has set up to ferry diners to and from the entrance to gardens by the bay.Some local branches of michellin starred restaurants/chefs fail to live up to their reputation ( I shan't mention which) - this is not one of them. Most excellent and thoughtful service alongside wonderfully creative and tasty dishes. Food should be delicious, but here it's also beautiful. Been here twice and they have yet to dissapoint. The staff are still a bit young, but make up for it with earnestness and a geniuine desire to please- I'm sure they will grow with time. Will definitely be back
5
The location is amazing and when we got there we were a little lost and had a gold car taking us to the restaurant. Although the ambience and decor is really nice, I think they should have taken more advantage of the beautiful gardens as a view. The food was delicious, my friends and I loved it a lot as well as the cocktails! The staff was friendly and helpful
3
The night didn't start to well as the signage to try and find Pollen is quite poor, so if you are trying to get there by train, give yourself a decent amount of time to find it. It's location is great and I expected the food to be just as great, it wasn't as exciting as the website made it out to be. The food was similar to what you could find elsewhere but at inflated prices. Don't get me wrong I don't mind paying for something that is amazing but when it is standard food that you could probably get elsewhere for $10 to $20 less per plate then it becomes a disappointment. I had the duck which I found to be ok, but again nothing special or prepared differently. So we skipped the desserts as we couldn't justify the prices they were charging. And I now wine is expensive in Singapore, but Pollen probably had the most expensive wine we had seen.I guess you can all make up your own minds if you want to give it a go.On a good note, the staff and service was very good
5
Such a lovely restaurant.. Amidst the flower dome....staff are very attentive... The food is gorgeous... Have been here on a date night with my husband and also have brought friends here a second time.... Pricey but nice for a special occasion... Love the decor and dinnerware.... The dessert bar is worth a visit... You can sit and watch the chefs creating your selected dish... Yum... Would go bac

Having a wonderful dinner at pollen last week after read so many reviews good n bad abt this restaurant. We give a go to see ourself. We had a buggy ride from e arrival hall (feeling Vip) friendly driver even he was not feeling well.. hehehe. when we reach the restaurant we decide to take a quicky tour on the dome as read some reviews u allow to access e garden once u dine in pollen.how wonderful is that. Buggy ride n free access to dome to start ur dinner. So here is e best part.We start with S.risotto , beef tartate n 2 gls of champagne.the starter already making our day with nice place,romantic for a couple. Then here come e main course my fav Roasted Cod n Pigeon, nice recommeded by e staff with good knowledge of food. Too long to share coz we really enjoy ourself much in pollen for a 1st timer. Long story short i give pollen 4.5 star out of 5 for overall. the sad thing we skip e dessert but "we cant leave pollen without sweets" *angry voice* but just joking. He gave us petit fours with their selection homemade cookies..mini cakes.. chocolate and we end our day thanks to this staff "Nur" for his good food knowledge. Recommedation food n Friendly service

Went to Pollen this week to try the set lunch at $55++ per person for 3 courses. Good selection for each course with great care being paid to the presentation. I requested fast service and this wasn't a problem for the staff. Overall quite happy.
3
Had lunch here on Sunday, I had the fixed lunch menu and overall the experience was good, starter was anchovies in a fennel soup, anchovies were good, fennel soup lacked flavour and the portion was very small. Main course was pork belly, that was really good, nice flavours for desert I had banana and coconut with madras ice cream definitely the highlight of the meal.Service was outstanding... but and its a big but, the place is devoid of any character its in the botanical gardens and I know they probably can't control this, but the windows were filthy, there is also no buzz or atmosphere, Sunday lunch and the place was dead.For the money, sadly you can do much better, its a shame as I am a massive fan of 22 Ships in Hong Kong but for the money and the hype Pollen just does not have it right. I have given it 3 stars overall though the food and service were excellent the overall experience and the standard set by JA's other restaurants drops the score
4
We were tired and it was definitely lunch time, so although the menu prices were not cheap, we entered. Many tables were reserved and it was pleasant sitting in an olive grove with 1000 year old olive trees. Due to the prices we decided on one course and a glass of a very good Tuscan white.Some people started arriving at the adjacent table and we soon realized it was a wedding group! In the time to enjoy our single course there was the ceremony, signing of documents, the grooms speech, a variety of photographs and the cutting of the cake (with more photographs). How very efficient

Went to Pollen last Friday evening for a business dinner. First of all, it's not easy to get to as the Gardens by the Bay is still relatively unknown in Singapore. Once you do find the location, you have to take a cart to the restaurant. Too Disney for me. No linens on the tables seemed strange. It's not a cheap restaurant. Lighting was not properly thought out...there is a reason that being a lighting designer is a profession. Odd mix of dates, families and business diners. But nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves with conversation. And the food wasn't terrible, it was actually good. But the odd mix of food and atmosphere...was all lost on me for the conversation was the highlight of the meal

We had high hopes for this restaurant having been to Maze in London and being told by others about the quality of Esquina (Jason athertons other restaurant in singapore). We were unfortunately a little disappointed with the overall experience. We had an 2000 booking on Saturday night. Surprisingly the restaurant was only half full, but that still did not prevent the staff from seating us at a table next to the toilets where we were seated side-by-side instead of facing each other. We asked to be moved and were seated at a much better table, although still very close to the table next to us. We ordered one bottle of champagne, starters and a main. We did not have dessert. The food was very good, especially the lobster starter. The restaurant does however lack atmosphere. It is difficult to work- out how the restaurant is positioning itself I.e it feels like a bistro rather than fine dining (no table cloths and loutish music). Yet the prices are extortionate, we were at the restaurant no longer than 80 mins and the bill was sgd 530. Admittedly that included a pretty average bottle of champagne (180) and we both had lobster for starters (55 each). However we did not order dessert. With due respect to pollen, the food was good, service ok, but there are much better options in singapore (Luke's chophouse in gemill lane- my favourite restaurant at moment)

Decided to bring some guests from out of town here last night for a dinner and discussion, but we were all slightly underwhelmed by the overly fussy food that came in small portions and was too highly priced for the simple atmosphere of the place.Without any table linens, it felt like the environment lacked a bit of flair or formality for such an expensive and hyped restaurant. I was slightly shocked that the place appeared more like a cafe or modern bistro, and the rest of the decor felt too simple amidst the awe inspiring Gardens by the Bay.The menu sounded exciting and the cooking was top notch, but the final result was slightly fussy for our taste. Service was excellent though and we felt well looked after

I went here on a mid week lunchtime and the place was packed. At S$55++ for a three course lunch with coffee and petit fours, this is real value for money – not least for a meal of this quality in one of the most expensive cities in the world.Nearly 24 hours on, I’m still thinking about yesterday’s lunch – and I’d happily eat it all again. Big eaters might find lunch a little on the light side, but I found all the dishes to perfectly balanced to leave you with plenty of energy for the afternoon – rather than feeling tired and full.Although we were a party of nearly 40, everything was perfect, from the unobtrusive and knowledgeable service to the quality of the food, which blew me away.Starters on the lunch menu at the moment are: ricotta, pea sorbet, tomato dressing flatbread (my choice and refreshingly delicious); pickled boquerones (anchovies), chilled fennel soup, black olive and orange salad; textures of potato, bacon, yuzu, sour cream pearls.The mains were equally as adventurous, while most of the party went for the ocean trout, gnocchi, new season peas, shimeji, garlic emulsion; I chose the Kurobuta pork belly, miso, asparagus, black sesame which was meltingly delicious and the delightful taste banished all thoughts of the number of calories it contained….My friend chose the third main: salt-baked ratte potatoes, cheese royale, pesto, nuts and seeds which she found delicious – just as potatoes should taste!Finishing without dessert would just be plain rude so in the interests of research we all chose a different sweet ending. My Thai Peanut (green apple, celery, praline and kaffir lime) was both palate-cleansingly refreshing and pleasingly sweet at the same time while the Chocolate ‘Kopi’ – which means coffee in Malay (rum raisin, coffee and truffle honey) was a triumph of confectionery. But the absolute winner was the Banana Madras curry (frozen coconut, sudachi lime, Madras curry) a clever combination that gave a subtle spicy kick to the back of the throat without overpowering the sweetness of the banana. Petits fours and coffee finished off a really enjoyable lunch and we appreciated the opportunity of a stroll through the Gardens’ flower dome before heading home.The restaurant is light and airy and they offer a nice touch of picking you up by shuttle from the taxi rank – it’s only a few minutes walk but in this heat it’s most welcome.I don’t know why I’ve never been to Pollen before – but I’ll certainly be back

The decision to go for lunch at Pollen was a spur of the moment one. Three adults had starters, main courses and deserts and we agreed that every single dish was not only beautiful but also delicious. We felt as if dining in a Michelin restaurant.With aperitifs (Cava and Pink Champagne) and a bottle of Mount Riley Sauvignon Blanc the bill came to nearly 700 Singapore $ so it is hard to claim excellent value for money.See pictures of my three dishe

Had a good time here and would highlight the atmosphere is peaceful, well lit and not over crowded with people. Staff were attentive and followed up with order and rechecking how everything was. Food was very good and well priced for the quality. If you want to try a little bit of everything order the lunch set. Will recommend to others
5
You shall not be disapointed at Pollen as the experience is truly an adventure to gastronomy heights. The welcome from Sonia Masih and her team is personal without being overly effusive.The menu and the delights therein will again add to the experience of wonderful preparation with very pleasing results.Look out Amuse in East Perth you have competition.Thank you all at Polle
5
Such a pleasant surprise to have such a great quality restaurant surrounded with gorgeous flowers while we have our afternoon tea here. As they are short of staff and it was a weekend, everyone was busy, but they still maintain a great attitude in serving customers. Look beyond the price and you will notice the quality they offered in the ingredients. Menu ain't extensive but you will know they are serving quality food. However, even for the ambience alone we are willing to pay for it

The Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay is a must see. Pollen has its own private entrance (and then you get free access to the spectacular Flower Dome). Food is very very good
3
This was my second visit to Pollen, the first was proceeded by good reviews and supposedly good pedigree, the second because someone else booked. It really is very disappointing, with the food just not being up to it. I realise Mr Atherton has probably only set foot in the kitchen a couple of times but if he'd tried the over cooked fish on the numerous cooking shows he judges he would have thrown a fit. As i was with clients who were paying politeness dictates, don't make a fuss. If it was my own money..... . Not all a disaster but if they are charging $60 plus for a small piece of fish it's not asking too much for it to be perfectly cooked

Pollen lives up to it's name not just because it's in a greenhouse surrounded by plants and flowers but because of it's capability to bloom. I was here sometime in July 2013 to check out the new attraction of Singapore (Gardens by the Bay) and happen to hear about the new restaurant housed inside the Flower Dome. I tried Pollen for lunch and I wasn't disappointed. My experience then was good, with the food and the service both up to par. So after almost a year, I decided to come back for dinner. This time around, I'm impressed. With most restaurants being great at first and then slacking off as the time goes by, Pollen took a different track. It did show much improvement as compared to my last visit. The buggy took us to Pollen and we were greeted by their friendly receptionists, and offered to enjoy the complimentary access to the Flower Dome first before it close at 9 (since we came from the dome the last time). We came back and were seated immediately to a nice table with a view of the Singapore Flyer and the bay. We decided to try their dinner tasting menu for that special night. I can say that service is more prompt and more efficient. Looks like they do know what they're doing, and they're doing it in a friendly way. We enjoyed the food and the food presentation better as well, specially commending on the Kurobuta pork belly dish and the ginger ale dessert. Our server made sure that we do not wait too long for the next dish and explained each course in detail. The sommelier did a good job as well in coming up with good wine pairing for each dish and being attentive to us. Even the petite female manager (sorry I can't remember her name but I think it starts with an M) came to our table to check how we are enjoying the food. That was a special night we are celebrating and we don't regret that we chose Pollen. It will be most likely our go-to place whenever we have special occasions

For full reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatPollen is Michelin star Chef Jason Atherton's second venture in Singapore, following Esquina (read review here). It also is the second outlet of his London flagship restaurant, Pollen Street Social. The food here is supposed to be Mediterranean-inspired modern European cuisine but really, i don't see or taste the Mediterranean at all.Dinner started with 3 little amuse bouche, all of which distracted us from the important task of creating our menu for the night.Choux bun filled with cheese and truffle. Cracklings served with an apple puree and arancini (breaded rice ball with cheese) served with hummus. Adored the arancini with the creamy risotto style rice.Our starters:The Mosaic of foie gras and confit duck with cherries and tangy apple puree ($40) was quite different from the usual that is served with berries compote. I highly recommend the Trip to Japan 2012 ($38). Stellar succulent and sweet scallop sashimi were served atop marinated daikon in a lemony and saltish broth of sake and mirin. The sea urchin didn't make a difference to the overall dish. Kinda seemed like it was thrown in just to glorify the dish. More snow in this one (horseradish) but it melted when we were happily snapping away. The Scottish lobster ($55) was an elaborate dish. When it was served, we were wondering if we accidentally ordered extra food. This was a 3 course dish and it consisted of an intense lobster bisque, a lobster 'burger' and chilled lobster with fennel cream and sea urchin.Our favorite was the bisque which was served in a wine glass. Exactly the way it should be savored. Next was the burger was done a la atas lobster roll style but with a buttery brioche bun. These were way better than the tasteless rubbery lobster chunks that were served with fennel cream and sea urchin. Again, the sea urchin was purposeless. Our mains- Kurobuta pork belly, braised cheek, charred spring onions, butternut squash, Sudachi lime ($67). There was a great balance of fat and meat. Take away all the sides and you have pork belly done Asian way. This is really good roast pork with kong ba essentially. The caramelized and smokey leek with sweet pumpkin puree were great accompaniments. The overall dish was delightful with the various textures and flavors. Halibut ($70) was recommended by our server. This is a lightly flavored dish and i'm more a fan of strong flavors. Despite that, the simply pan fried fish held up on its own.We were stuffed but we had to have desserts to conclude our Pollen experience. We had the Pollen "Tatin" which was made of Verjusm creme fraiche, caramel jelly, red and green apples ($20). I'd much rather a pot of tea with their stellar petit fours. For that i had the moist matcha cake, perfect lime macaron, smooth coffee chocolate and a piece of candy to end the meal. Overall, the Pollen experience was great. Certainly would recommend Pollen for a special occasion

There are two eateries here – a bistro upstairs and a fancier restaurant downstairs. My friend had booked a table in the restaurant so we were able to call the buggy to collect us from the pickup point (useful if you are wearing heels and it is a blisteringly hot day!) Some molecularly gastronomic offerings in our set lunch. I started with the Pickled boquerones (white anchovy), chilled fennel soup, black olive and orange salad. It was OK, but I came away thinking “So what? I could have done that!” The chilled fennel soup was about 2 tablespoons-worth, decorously poured onto to your plate in front of you. Tasty but, as I explained to the waitress – very tricky to eat “soup” off a flat dinner plate! I ended up mopping it up with a bit of bread! Main course was Kurobuta pork belly, miso, asparagus, black sesame - mostly nice but the miso was a slightly strong flavour . We went upstairs to the Bistro (with view of and access to the Flower Dome) where we enjoyed our dessert, coffee and petit fours. Out of the three courses I appreciated the dessert most – which is surprising because I do not usually have dessert. This was a beautifully refreshing sorbet – Thai Peanut (garnish thing) green apple, celery, praline, kaffir lime. To be absolutely honest I enjoyed the amuse bouches, bread and delicious butters most of all. The service was very attentive and pleasant. It was nice to have free access to the Dome afterwards. All in all a pleasant experience – pricey though at SGD70 with no booze. Not sure I would repeat it unless someone else was paying

We had pre-booked a table for two at Pollen before coming to Singapore. After the golf buggy ride from the taxi stop in the wonderful gardens, we had a magnificent meal. The view from our table out to the Singapore skyline and the "flyer" was excellent. The staff were most attentive and professional and told us of their links in the past to London and Mr Ramsay. There were canapes and pre-desert offerings as extras which were a lovely touch. The entrees were both nice, a beetroot based salad and a trout inspired starter. We had a main for two consisting of a massive piece of Australian grown beef which was a little underdone. Getting meat cooked really medium anywhere now requires an assault on the chef it seems. The head sommelier was very approachable and provided a good red wine from Argentina to go with the main course. Although very expensive this was an unforgettable evening which we will always remember - thank you to the team at Pollen

This is the third time I have visited Pollen and find its growing on me. As I was riding back to the car it struck me why this was. In my first visit, I had read about Pollen, London and was awed. Pollen Singapore simply did not live up to that expectation. The second time I eat from the set menu and was surprised but the meal was spoilt by one of my guest not having enjoyed anything on the a la carte. The third visit it was only family and we all ate off the set menu and no one was disappointed but the 'wow' was limited to the amuse-bouche (the apple & dijon and cod fish paste was stunning), the sour dough bread and the 'citrus foam' with the fish. Given this - why go back 3 times? Because it is a perfect Saturday or Sunday lunch. Nothing too heavy, then before dessert, a stroll around the gardens (free admission to the dome it is in) and then dessert, home and a quick nap. Also very good value at S$55 for the set, add another $25 for the bubbly and other drinks and with taxes below S$100

My boyfriend flew to Singapore to see me and I brought him to Gardens by the Bay to check out this new place. We got hungry strolling around and I remember my friend telling me about Pollen. So I wanted to give it a try but considering it is a last minute thing and this kind of place might be packed on a weekend, I tried my luck and call to make a reservation. The person on the other line was very accommodating and she was able to slot us in and told us about the buggy service and the complimentary access to the dome. We got there and decided to order the set lunch which I think is a good value for my money($55), with bread and canapes before the meal and petit fours and coffee at the end. We were led to the Gardens and walked around. The buggy took us back to the visitor centre afterwards. I can say overall that it is impressive. From the reservation,to the buggy, to the reception to the efficient service, I had definitely enjoyed my first time with them. Will be coming back again to bring my family next time

We were touring the Gardens by the Bay and the husband pushed me into eating lunch here as we are great fans of Jason Atherton's restaurants in the UK.As other reviewers have said the $55 set lunch is excellent value for money with three amuse bouche and bread followed by coffee and petit fours.I had the slow cooked egg with asparagus - excellent and amazing the way the egg yolk is neither solid nor liquid. My husband had the scallops which he thought were amazing.For mains I had the fregole with goats cheese and my husband had the spring baby chicken, both of which were delicious. I was amazed at the massive flavours in the fregole - often the vegetarian option is a bit bland in restaurants but not here.I had the NUT dessert, a fantastic mix of flavours and hubby had the Banana Madras Curry which really challenged the taste-buds but actually worked really well.Despite being hot and sweaty, having schlepped around the Gardens by the Bay, and very obviously dressed as tourists we found all the staff extremely polite and friendly - we were offered some wine by the glass and when my husband wasn't convinced we were given a taste - the sommelier was more than happy to make other suggestions.There were two large-ish tables having lunch at the same time but we didn't feel overwhelmed or sidelined by them.A definite recommend
4
Pollen benefits from being in the garden by the Bay. Food is very good. The wine selection was extensive and expensive. We were a large group and service was excellent. All in alla very impressive experience.
5
I really enjoyed the time and dinner there.
Highly recommended!
4
As an appetizer we ordered some sort if duck dish.. Not impressed, it was like duck pâté. Guess I am not a fan of duck. Our starters we awesome but not sure what they all were(these were free and came before you ordered). I ordered the tenderloin and it was amazing. Husband ordered the marlon and it was also cooked to perfection. Staff was great however i felt that every time I asked a question about the menu they would turn their nose up to me. Deserts were an art and the lady making them was maestro. She was amazing. very expensive place however if you are a food connoisseur this is the place to be

I have been to Pollen before, about 6 months ago, but that was lunch. This time I went for dinner and I was just as impressed. Set in one of the two beautifully-made "greenhouse" dome in Gardens by the Bay, Pollen has an advantage over many restaurants. It is much drier in the dome so I instantly felt as if I was in Europe. The views are lovely - you can see the Singapore flyer and Marina Bay Sands. Service was excellent; we arrived 45 minutes early and had the option to view the Flower Dome before dinner. After a short stroll we started dinner at 7pm. The restaurant wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be but I understood that it was fully booked for the evening.My partner had the tasting menu while I ordered a few dishes from the a la carte menu. I had the "Trip to Japan - 2012" which was sublime (Hokkaido scallops on Japanese radish, with wasabi cream and pickles), and the Halibut - great, but wasn't the best I had. The presentation of the dishes were truly a delight; it reminded me of the kaiseki meals I had in Kyoto. What I liked about the dinner was actually the bread and the starters - all very well done.I shared desserts with my partner and it wasn't excellent, but they were still very good. We then took our wine and tea upstairs to the courtyard to enjoy the rest of the evening. It was very quiet in the dome by the time we went upstairs, and it felt as if we were having a glass of wine in a quiet bistro under the stars. Definitely a romantic date option

Online booking on Saturday for dinner for 2 on Monday was quick and easy. We turned up early to have a walk around the Flower Dome. Ambience is casual - polo shirts and jeans, bare wooden table tops, dining places at the bar, jarring music, not terribly comfy chairs. Service is friendly and not over-attentive. Tastiness of food, and speed of serving is uneven. Complimentary sourdough bread and 3 canapes arrived quickly and were very good to excellent. One of our choices for starter was out (crab gazpacho). The squid risotto and scallop sashimi we had were inventive and excellent. We were then asked if we wanted to have a wander round the Flower Dome (like the couple next to us). We should have taken the hint as it was a long wait for the main courses. When they arrived, they were a letdown after what we had, which was delight (or something close) in every mouthful. I had the halibut. The grilled vegetables that came with it were great, and the smoked eel was a nice touch. The sea urchin cream, which sold me on the dish as halibut is not the most exciting of fish, fooled me, even though it wasn't a blind tasting. The tenderloin and beef cheek were decent and unexceptional.Dessert (Pollen Tatin) arrived promptly and was back to expectations - delight in every mouthful.I had two glasses of Albarino. The winelist leans towards younger vintages and less expensive areas, but there are many S$1k+ bottles with names non-geeks would recognise, for those who need that sort of expense.Conclusions: Great location, some great food. Take the opportunity to have a walk in the Flower Dome, which otherwise charges $12 for admission. If you are looking for posh, this is not the place
5
We visited with friends on Saturday night for my husband's birthday and was not disappointed! The four of us had the tasting menu which was delicious.....the highlight being the fish course, the flavours were beautiful. We have also dined at Esquina and Keong Saik Snacks, all 3 places are a credit to Jason Atherton
5
The set lunch at S$55,- was excellent, service is attentive and there is a great choice of wines by the glass. Scallops in a truffle soup was full of flavor and beef cheeks superbly prepared. The great "amuses" served with our champagne already set the tone; lovely place in a wonderful setting. Highly recommended but it comes at a price if you don't choose the menu..

I've eaten many times at Maze in London when Jason Atherton ran the show - a winner every time. I visited Pollen in Singapore based on this. The food was interesting and of a high standard but didn't bring 'wow' to mind - a regular occurrence at Maze. Anyhow, there's something unfair about comparing the two restaurants and so I'll stop.The restaurant is in the botanical gardens and so the location is world class. We were collected at the taxi drop off by a member of staff who drove us through the gardens to the restaurant in a golf buggy; a great start to a great evening. The range of dishes was very good and each was clearly made with great skill and passion. I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The wine list matches the food well - for price and range - and the services was very professional and friendly. I liked that, I hate 'professional and aloof'.On finishing the meal, Chef Colin Buchan showed our party around the kitchens. This was unexpected but very welcomed by all. I love to see the 'engine room' and how it works. The evening finished back in the golf buggy with a full tour of the gardens - beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. A great evening.Back to the title of my review. I am always sceptical about great chefs establishing new restaurants so geographically remote from 'headquarters'. However, in this case, I am pleased to report that it does trave

We spent the evening here recently, as part of a group of 20 business colleagues.The location is awesome, inside the Flower Dome, allowing you to stroll & see the flowers before you eat.We started in the bar. They have a good selection and the staff are willing. Unfortunately, they were clearly overwhelmed with 20 of us and several of us had to wait while they prepared our drinks. Spirits were fast but wine & champagne took time!We then went downstairs, to enjoy the food.The bread is delicious, something I always enjoy in Singapore, as good bread is rare!All the food on the menu was delicious, in particular the desserts. I could not get enough of the small chocolate/toffee bites.The only criticism was the service, again, whether they are under-staffed or the kitchen could not cope; it took a little too long for the food to join us.Otherwise, great food, friendly service, fantastic location & we'll go back

We decided to visit Pollen, aptly set in the Flower Dome conservatory at Gardens by the Bay, as our dining treat for our holiday. Please don't confuse the bistro upstairs with the restaurant downstairs! The set lunch menu was excellent value and the portion sizes so much to our liking that every plate went back empty. The wine list was extensive, and while not inexpensive, had a great range of quality wines. Divine food, superlative service and, the BEST plate of petit fours ever. And I mean ever
5
Thought we'd try this as we like 'social' and JA style. Lunch menu was 3 courses - they are small, but we like that. Also, 3 lovely canapÃ©s that were delicious - so 4 small courses really. Food was a lesson in professionalism by the executive chef who was kind enough to take us round the kitchens afterwards. Drinks are expensive but a fixed 3+ course lunch at this price - really really good value. Oh, and free entrance to flower dome too - absolute bargain!

This is the restaurant that you go to if you want to splurge or impress someone :-). We were there for a company dinner. The food was good, the service impeccable. The bar above is simply lovely with beautiful floral aroma. Only thing is, the whole restaurant is really quite chilly

A business dinner with a guest in town, so thought we try a new place and bring him around for a walk in the dome before dinner. The buggy service from the car park main entrance was impressive and started the evening well. The welcome as the door was decent and was shown upstairs.The setting of the restaurant inside the dome was impressive but as it was still dinner, my review is basically below average for the price and service.Service staff was more concern about their accents that they cannot be understood. Even tho only 3 tables was being served upstairs the respond to our hand waving was slow and seems like the staff in jackets, prefers the waitress in uniform to attend to us rather than themselves. Trying to come across as some snooty upper class fine dining restaurant but forget that the customer pays the bill. The food was good but for that price I can name a few places with better fine dining service and friendlier staff. It can certainly do better and was saved from a poorer rating by being in the dome

The place is much more intimate than what one imagines on the groundfloor of the Mediterranean greenhouse and evenings in southern Europe being chilly, I advise you to bring a pullover. My back would have been freezing without!The degustation menu is one Michelin star level and the professional service even above. Wine choice is outstanding and if you want to impress the people you entertain this is the right place. You will pay a lot of money, but you get something for it.People in Singapore dining quickly we were the last in the restaurant at 2230 and moved to the upper level at 2300 where before being served dessert we were encouraged to make a tour in the huge greenhouse which was closed to the public at that time - what a luxury. We left close to 0100 after digestifs and I felt sorry for the two staff members who had to wait our departure. But they looked genuinly happy that we enjoyed. One of my guests gave them a very consistent well dserved tip

I have been to Pollen on several occassions, this time I just popped in for drinks and a light meal , to introduce this special restaurant to a friend of mineThe moment you step into the restaurant you absorbed by the sheer magic of the garden setting, followed by outstanding food and service ...I will certainly be back many more time

great place to spend an evening with a group or as a couple. enjoy the meals, take a stroll, enjoy the controlled climatic conditionsThought the veggie menu is very limited, which I hope they will improve upon, the taste was divine. the ambiance adds to the flavour and service is commendable upon. If I can summarise the place.... its a delight... enjoy the limited but fablous good and one of the best ambiance that I have experienced. will definitely be back there soo

We really like Pollen. This was our second visit, the first time was in October last year and they both were for lunch. We had the set menu which is SG$70++ which we think is very good value. 3 courses, entree, main and dessert and you choose from 3 meals in each course.The restaurant is light, airy and the seating very comfortable. The service is very good, though the food is the star. Perfectly prepared meals that are presented well on beautiful stoneware plates. Pollen is definitely on our list of restaurants to visit when we are in Singapore

Fabulous evening. The drive through the gardens was lovely. The staff were prompt but not overbearing. The food spectacular. The steak, duck fat chips and salad were divine. The vegetarian menu lovely, especially the risotto - might look small, but is flavorsome and filling. The amuse-bouche and petit fours are both delightful. The worse thing was the arrogant people who think it's acceptable to allow their children to run around a restaurant like this, whilst they type on their phones and leave their maids to chase after the children

With a name like Pollen, getting a twitchy nose as you sit at a table in its dramatic interior (in the Flower Dome of Gardens by the Bay) shouldn't come as a surprise. The indoor/outdoor vegetation is an interesting design but what stands out here, happily, is the food. Choosing from the a la carte menu, and with wine recommendations for each dish, this was a marvellous experience. Mediterranean-inspired cuisine, deftly handled and very, very tasty. The menu changes all the time depending on the availability of ingredients so dishes may not be as described on the website. Three stand-outs - the apple and mustard puree served with small arancini as an amuse bouche, the duck with black truffle paste and the assortment of petits-fours, but everything was utterly delicious. The service was knowledgeable and efficient and the wine offerings very interesting - including a Moscato recommended with a scallop sashimi as a starter. The interior of the restaurant is kept very cool so women would find it handy to bring a wrap. This was our second visit and so impressed with the standard of food, next time we intend to try the tasting menu
3
My visit to Pollen started off poorly as the restaurant did not pick up the phone for the shuttle from the entrance to Garden's By the Bay. Although there is a prominent sign for the restaurant at the entrance and one is instructed to call for a pick-up, in fact no one answered the phone. If you are offering this service (and it is a long, hot walk from the drop-off zone) then pick up the phone. A shuttle came by about 5 minutes later but it would have been nice to have someone confirm this for me as I was considering walking. Once there, the food is quite innovative and of high quality and the setting is lovely (although you look out on a concrete wall). Portions are fairly small and while everything I tasted was very good, it was not good value for the prices charged. The service is pretty good although I did have to ask three times for a fill-up of the bread tray. The waitress did explain each dish although her English was difficult to understand and in the end, I tuned her out as it was too difficuly tring to figure out what she was saying

Why is it difficult to find a restaurant that offers great views and great food at the same time? Singapore Pollen has it right when it comes to great views, but they have to try harder on the great food front.I took my son, daughter in law and a friend there for dinner, and despite having reserved a table for four, the young lady at the reception appeared confused as she had a reservation for a table for two. She politely requested us to wait at the bar while she sorted it out, and came back shortly to say she had found our reservation. It seems that she was looking up a wrong name.No sooner did we sit, that a young lady wheeled in champain on ice to our table. We declined and asked for the wine list. The wine list is not too long, but there is an unusual and eclectic choice of wines, and the wine waiter very knowledgeable. His suggestion of a Chilean red proved excellent. They do serve wine by the glass, so you don't have to buy the whole bottle.The complimentary bread brought with the wine was small pieces of baguette, entirely avoidable, because the crust had turned very hard and the body, very dry. The green olives were excellent, as were the pork crackers with an apple sauce dip.The Menu , interestingly, includes Breakfast in the form of a tester's menu, which presumably, is served all day. The starters included roasted quail,roasted squid consommé, Crab cocktail, scallop sashimi, and poached lobster salad. From the Main courses we ordered roasted Brittany cod with razor clams,wild mushrooms & sorrel, and Line-caught John Dory with Spanish rice, cabaneros & asparagus. The other items on the main menu included Roasted seabass, Rack of lamb, braised shoulder,Roasted duck, Rangers Valley 300-day tenderloin wagyu beef or a rib-eye,Cote de boeuf (1kg for two persons to share). Though well plated and presented, the portions were abysmally small, and the taste wasn't exceptional. I had greater expectations from the Michelin starred Jason Atherton's Pollen. The food, though good, was too pricy for for its not so exceptional taste.The deserts of sorbets were excellent, although, again, the portions were tiny. These included Japanese green tea raspberry sorbet,Crispy and burnt lemon meringue with cucumber sorbet, the restaurant's signature Peanut butter and blueberry sorbet which we ordered, and Frozen honeycomb walnut pudding and goat cheese sorbet.The best part of the meal was not the food. It was the view. It was a pleasure to sit in the cool air conditioned restaurant,at a table by the window. It was magical to watch the equatorial night descend across the Marina bay on downtown Singapore,when the slow turning Singapore Eye become neon dashes and dots of blue as the background buildings turned into towers of light.The restaurant, and the price of the dinner, was worth it for that show alone

Pollen is in the bowels of the Flower 'greenhouse' at Marina Gardens. Well the restaurant part is anyway.Upstairs the bar has a great view over all of the flowers and the people coming and going.Downstairs the restaurant looks at some concrete.Upstairs the temperature is cool but manageableDownstairs it's 'nipples as weapons' arrestably cold.Upstairs service is brisk if a little inattentiveDownstairs it's overly attentive and as glacial as the temperature.If only they could combine the best of each.Pollen is ambitious (no bad thing) but it lets itself down on little things. Again and again.I get slow dining as a movement. But that's different to slow service. Different to l-o-n-g waits between courses. And longer waits for the bill - and to hand your card to someone - and to get it back and sign.And ambition turns tricksy too. There's too much table side theatre (every item with a sauce, a pan, a 'do this'. There are too many items that just don't work (cucumber ice cream being one) and it's ridiculously poor value ($36 crab gazpacho starters that use a third of a crab and less tomato)Too many staff make for confusion too (three waiters tried to take my card for the bill, all seemed perplexed as to who HAD taken it)It wasn't a bad experience. It just wasn't the experience promised. And it was COLD down there. Silly cold. A great shame, I'd recommend the bar (and bar snacks) instea

We had a delightful evening at Pollen. My partner knows the London restaurant and felt the standard was equally high. I thought the food and service were outstanding from the delicious tanqueray cocktail to start through to the yummy petit fours to finish. The dining room is spacious and elegant and the location quite ethereal as you can wander through the gardens to to reach it.My John Dory main course was a real highlight but would happily recommend any of the dishes we tried
4
I made reservations over the phone to celebrate a friend's birthday on Mar 23, a sat noon for group of 12.. Due to various co-ordination, we made numerous changes on dates and headcount, the restaurant was very prompt with all the request via email and were accomodating to our last minute changes. During the lunch, they assisted with how specific i had wanted the sequence of food service and executed the presentation of the cake to the birthday girl in very timely fashion as per my instructions. We had set lunch as well as a la carte. The food presentation was beautiful and excellent in taste and flavour. Love the salad, the cote de boeuf was super, the truffle / mayonnaise mash was awesome. i love the peanut butter blue berry sorbet. Service staff on the floor were very attentive on the day. Worth the visit and you can enjoy the sunshine while staying cool in the dome

Me and my wife decided to dine in Pollen to be our final destination before going back to London. It was Friday night and the restaurant was full house. We were sat right next to the garden and were offered a glass of champagne to start. A perfect drink to start as we were quite thirsty after walking from Marina Bay Sands Hotel (where we stayed) to Pollen. We were served nice and warm bread selection. I love the baguette and wife enjoyed the sourdough. A good meal to start! While reading the menu, canapés were served. Sicilian olives were huge and yummy! Crispy pork scratching blended very well with the apple puree. We were offered if we wanted more olives as we finished everything even before placing an order. It was a busy night and we never felt any lapse in service. We enjoyed the bread and canapés wanting not to order any starter. I felt bad after offering if we wanted to have starter before main course so I ordered lobster salad. It was a good choice. Very light and refreshing. The frozen tomato water add the wow factor in the dish. Our wine was served before the main course and had a little chat with the sommelier. All service staff were professionals. Our main course were served and it was articulately explained and made the dishes even more enticing! I must say that the portions are generous. We are so full and thinking not to have desserts. But of course, dessert menu were presented after clearing our empty plates in the table. The lady manager came over to introduced all the desserts in the menu. My wife ordered the tatin and im still thinking .. I'm torn between the Ocumare Cremuex and PBJ. was a little pressured coz I kept the manager waiting for my decision. I just told her to decide for me and she chose Ocumare Cremuex for my dessert. We requested to serve the dessert after we finished our wine. The service was very attentive despite how crowded the restaurant was. A pre-dessert were served. We enjoyed the freshness of watermelon with ginger ale ice. Then the desserts were served. The taste of Ocumare Cremeux was "immaculate". Good recommendation from the lady manager. I love the texture of chocolate crumble with honey saffron ice cream as well as the creaminess of pistachio parfait. My wife enjoyed her tatin too! It was a very pleasant meal and ordered a cup of coffee. Few minutes later, PBJ were served as complimentary. What a surprised as we never expected to have exceptional experience in Pollen. Petit fours were served with my cup of coffee and mini magnums to die for. it was absolutely amazing! This is the best service I've ever had and will definitely come back and recommend Pollen to my friends when they visit Singapore

We loved the location.It is very nice to walk among the super trees in the Gardens By The Bay.A jitney will pick you up at the entrance and take you to the Flower Dome.You may enjoy the dome if you are early enough,or enter Pollen which is on the ground floor, not up in the super trees.five of ate there.four out of five of us enjoyed our dinner.the staff was very nice, and the somelier was accomodating and fun.Our greatest complaint was that it took us almost a half an hour to get our pre-dinner cocktail.there seemed to have been some problem with bar service.this is a fairly new restarrant, so perhaps they had staffing issues that evening.I think staffing is becoming a problem in some restaurants in Singapore

Pollen for all it's publicity and hype turned out to be a disappointment for me. Ambience and a beautiful setting alone do not make the hallmarks of an excellent restaurant. It has to be complimented with very good food and good service.When all the elements are right customers, even if prices are on the high side, do still leave with a good feeling of money well spent.I was an invitee to a birthday lunch for the first time to Pollen on 11 March 2013. I arrived somewhat early at 12:10pm so with 2 other friends we sat at the ground floor bar area where I ordered my peach fruit juice. It took 20 minutes and 3 times of checking with the staff before I finally got my fruit juice. It was a no brainer to come to the conclusion the restaurant was short staffed.There was only 1 barman and 1 stressed-out waiter in attendance to customers present. At the restaurant upstairs, arrangements for our group was a 3 course set lunch menu at SGD 70++ per head. The portions were unfairly small for the price paid.As an example,the description of dessert on the menu looked so tempting but when it came , my comment to the waiter was " what!!! so small " The ice cream which was part of the very small portion of dessert was about the size of a quail's egg.The appetizer and main course in taste were ok, nothing to rave about, but portions looked rationed. As a matter of interest I asked to look at the a la cart menu just to check prices. On average appetizers cost SGD 40 and mains around SGD 60+.In Singapore there are good restaurants , a few of them I have written up about on Tripadvisor which I call " My little jewels " where average costs for a 3 course lunch is at SGD 35++ offering excellent food, good service and niceambience.The one positive comment I have for Pollen is for their bread. It came to table fresh, oven warm and tasted very good.TIP FOR DINERS: If you dine at Pollen you are entitled to free entry only after your meal (not before) to view the fantastic Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay. So eat first then do a tour of the Flower Dome after you have finished. Perhaps that would somewhat justify the high cost for your meal in the restaurant.Lotus_ku

Went for a birthday lunch for a party of 5 adults. Getting to the restaurant from the Gardens By the Bay Information area by the restaurant's buggy was seamless and easy enough. The setting was wonderful but the food didn't quite live up to its name nor its price. We ordered the set lunch menu – with mixed results. The vegetarian option on the menu was disappointing in terms of seasoning, presentation and taste, rather unmemorable. The meat and fish options though were better-received by my guests. The deserts were a high standard - creative and beautifully-presented, two of them a wonderful visual play of the gardens themselves. The Ocumare Cremeaux is a highlight. The low light of Pollen on the day we lunched, was unfortunately its waitstaff who were helpful but definitely not well-trained nor polished enough as befitting a restaurant of this price range. Service was very patchy, our request for bread was met only after asking 3 times with different staff. When I made the reservation, I was asked if I was celebrating any occasion and I responded that it was a milestone birthday celebration, whereupon I was told that this was duly noted. For a party of five adults, the restaurant presented a very mini magnum and three macaroons to the birthday guest at the table, the gesture coming across like a rushed and ungenerous afterthought when the bill had been paid and we were ready to leave. Overall, an experience that doesn't quite make the cut

I had a dinner two days ago in Pollen restaurant with my husband. I called to say that it was our anniversary and i can definitely say that the staff makes my dinner unforgettable.The food was well balance , good portion, extremely satisfied as much as the service.I was extremely impressed by the attention of details , and in fact they make us feel like we were the only table at the restaurant.From start to dessert, the food was constantly magical. In the end, we got a complimentary cake , this attention makes me say that i highly recommend this place: for a wonderful night out or a delightful culinary experience

How could we possibly visit Singapore and not eat at the Asian cousin of our favourite London restaurant? Actually, we hadn't intended to do so but after two nights eating in food courts, we had 'saved' enough money to justify this as a last lunch splurge before flying on to Sydney.The first obvious difference between the two is that we hadn't needed to book weeks in advance. Indeed, when we turned up 15 minutes early there was no trouble in seating us immediately since the restaurant was two thirds empty. This is a shame since the original Pollen Street Social is a vibrant, lively place no matter what time of day you are there. It certainly doesn't need to resort to the canned music which was too much in evidence on this occasion. Conversely, the Singapore location beats its London counterpart hands down: adjacent to the excellent Flower Dome, part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, it has its own internal garden and is partially open to the elements. Disconcertingly, this means that small birds often fly through the room looking for gourmet crumbs. (I think Jason Atherton should avoid replicating this with London pigeons....). Early TA reviewers seemed very exercised about the inaccessibility of the restaurant which is puzzling since it is only a short walk from Marina Bay Sands. If you prefer to arrive by taxi, you are picked up by a golf buggy and driven through the Gardens which are worth a visit themselves.So what of the main deal, the food? To my mind, although both savoury courses were good, they were not in the PSS league. They were preceded by the customary large olives (not quite the same iridescent green as in London, though.) and salt cod dip (better and more fishy here) but also by a very generous portion of succulent deep-fried baby squid served with a hot red chilli sauce.From the pris fixe lunch menu we both opted for the crabmeat starter which was a work of art in terms of its presentation but to my taste was lacking in flavour and seasoning. The white crab meat was accompanied by wafer thin slices of cauliflowers and a slice of Japanese pear with peanuts scattered over it. The main course, fried red snapper, came in the form of a large piece of fish on a bed of saffron mash, topped with 2 prawns and an artichoke with a rich sauce 'Bouillabaisse' poured over. This was colourful, robust and pleasant eating although again not at the level of PSS; the fish was just slightly overcooked, its skin not quite crisp enough, and the whole dish was cooler than I prefer.Having begun to reach a conclusion about the overall standard of cooking, to my great surprise at the dessert course the kitchen suddenly raised its performance by one if not two levels. My wife inevitably chose what she thinks is her fourth incarnation of Jason's famous PBJ since his Maze days and pronounced it the best version to date. My choice was an 'Ocumare Cremeux' which translates as pistachio parfait with honey saffron and a toasted brioche base, better presented than the dessert I had in PSS this January and even more delicious. The dessert chef was clearly on a roll since he followed this up with a complementary mini-Magnum apiece (truffle and honey ice cream beneath the chocolate casing which seemed to have been dusted with a fruit flavour, possibly black currant) and 3 large macaroons before, stomachs groanin, we polished off a plate of petit fours with our coffees.A bill of about $S300 makes this a trifle more costly than the London restaurant but Singapore is not a cheap city and I suspect that this is probably par for the course so far as fine dining is concerned

This was an excellent belated Valentines dinner set in a fantastic environment. They had a very comprehensive dining options and separate vegetarian menu which was excellent. The service was at a very high standard and the food and drinks matched. They also have a buggy service to take you to Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino or to the car park.One of the best views and one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Definitely will be back
3
The food is good buy waaaaay overpriced, even for Singapore. Service is average - although well staffed, they didn't seem to know when/how to engage. So, at times we were desperate for water and at other times we were asked if we wanted more bread every 2 minutes. We enjoyed the free entry into the Flower Dome after our meal which was a highlight
3
It was hard to figure what this restaurant's about. The theme seemed to echo the gardens but not sure if the decor or the menu or food had any connection. Nice setting but could get to become a very "me too" restaurant. Service was good enough but food was only so so and expensive for the price. Small portions too. There are many places in Spore with good ambience with better food

With an overseas guest in town, 8 of us decided to try out Pollen. The journey from the entrance to the restaurant had some excitement since we took a buggy in. Unfortunately, the restaurant was disappointing. Service was very poor as the staff cleared bowls/plates without asking if we wanted it cleared. They also crossed over people when serving, causing us to have to stop our conversation when they did so. All the staff seemed to speak with an accent and the staff that was introducing wine to our overseas guest spoke with such a strong accent that we couldn't understand but our guest was kind enough to just nod his head.The cod I had tasted more like a tasteless Snapper but was told by the staff that it was a Brittany Cod which is supposed to have more oil. I believe I have tasted much better Cod then this. The steak came in quite a big size, however, the meat was of poor quality and chewy.Overall, a very disappointing experience and unacceptable price to pay for the quality of the food and poor service

This review will be mainly based on the dishes I ate. I patronised this restaurant for lunch on a weekday. I had the "Trip to Japan 2012" and the "Cote de Boeuf". Before that, I must commend the bread which was served. It is not common to find good bread in Singapore (compared to other countries) but the sourdough and baguette were a real treat. Crunchy on the outside but fluffy and solid in the inside. I had the Trip to Japan 2012 as my starter, it is basically scallop and sea urchin sashimi. It was all right, but a little stingy on the sea urchin. For the main course, I shared the Cote de Boeuf with my father. It is a 1 kg prime rib. The steak was cooked to our liking; medium rare. However, it was a little on the fat side, about 1/4 of the steak was pure fat. It was still a good main course though.Overall, the restaurant was pretty good, nice and quiet ambiance (in the afternoon), friendly staff. But I feel the service could be improved. No doubt the waiters were friendly, they lacked knowledge about some of the food served in terms of how it is prepared or what ingredients are used etc. Hope this review was helpful
3
The food is pretty average, if not boring. The staff was pretty obnoxious and seemed to have a bit holier than thou attitude. When my colleague ordered his steak to be cooked medium-rare the waiter "tsked" and gave him a nasty look.That being said I would go there once just for the location. Beautiful place. I would recommend going for a late dinner - then you have the flower dome to yourself

Unlike many other reviewers my wife and I had good service and attention. We arrived without a reservation, on Monday night - the place was packed! We had a couple of drinks upstairs before they found us a table. Nice bread to get us started, but the meal was a big disappointment! Small portions without the distinctive flavour/touch that should make it special at the prices they charge! The final straw was our desserts - apple tatin - which contained a minuscule amount of apple and simply wasn't a tatin! Neither upside down nor caremelized! We should have complained, but felt the staff had been good and they had catered for us - so we paid the $700+ bill and left
1
I ve been there two weeks ago, the place was not so crowded, there were just few table occupied. A guy seated me and my wife after that he disappeared. On the bar there was another Chinese corpulent guy very busy doing stuff, basically he ignored all the customers and when a lady, from another table, asked him to be served he answered her in a bad way, so she left the restaurant quite upset. I walk by my self too and i found in the back some staff shifting table, i asked them to be served as well, after 5 minutes a guy came, but when we order a simple cappuccino he replied us they run out of milk. Then we walked off as well. I heard the chef is pretty famous but is a real pity that the service is completely mess up and not friendly at all. Is a real waste i wont come there again

When visiting Singapore recently - some local friends suggested we try Pollen. The menu was not very exhaustive or imaginative. The staff are not very attentive and always mixed up our drinks and dinner orders. For a table of 5 people - staff should pay more attention. Nice atmosphere - but food and service could improve

Went to check out the new Gardens by the Bay on a weekend with the family (including 2 toddlers) and visiting parents. All the walking around the gardens was wonderful to get one's appetite going, so tried to get a table at Pollen, but it was full. In fact, it was booked out for the whole weekend.So we walked upstairs to the Bistro and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of their food. All the food ordered from the Bistro comes out of the same kitchen as the restaurant (the menu is different). I simply had the best fish and chips in Singapore! Perfectly cooked cod with batter that was crispy and light. I also tried the gazpacho, beet salad and salt & pepper baby octopus. The octopus was a little too greasy but everything else was amazing! I had to come back and eat at the restaurant; so I did 2 weeks later.My hubby and I had our anniversary dinner and it capped off our special day perfectly!The menu was succint with an extensive wine range from the old world. The steaks (Sirloin with beef cheeks, and rib eye) were generous is size and perfectly cooked. The duck fat chips were delectable! The dessert menu was tempting and we tried a few things, but I can't remember them right now. It may have something to do with the delicious Burgundy wine we had.Attentive and knowledgeable service staff, modern but relaxing interior and the location within the Flower Dome, makes Pollen my favourite restaurant in Singapore right now.PS - The restaurant is child friendly by providing child friendly toilet seats, wash basin and Stokke high chairs. And if they get restless, there's plenty of interesting flora to explore. Unfortunately, there's not a separate child menu, but most children would enjoy the fish and chips from the bistro, or the rib eye from the restaurant. Enjoy

We went for a celebration dinner with about 10 friends. I don't usually write this type of review but we were really wowed and wanted to give them credit. We were given a beautiful table by the garden and the windows. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The quail brunch starter was amazing and well presented, as was the suckling pig. My wife had the tenderloin which was also well-flavored. For desserts we moved upstairs to the bistro and got a table looking out into the Flower Dome. The desserts were imaginative. I especially enjoyed the PB&J. We will definitely be back

The restaurant compares to any in NYC, SF, Chicago, LA etc. Very pretty setting, in the flower dome; free admission into the dome. The service in general was good except for a snooty local manager who all but rolled his eyes every time he talked to us. Honestly. Otherwise, attentive and top-notch service. We were here on Christmas Eve but managed to order from the ala carte menu. Each dish was meticulously crafted and delicious; it actually really reminded me of meals in SF (perhaps not quite Gary Danko, but certainly Spruce, Foreign Cinema etc.)Would recommend for a romantic or special occasion. Guaranteed to impres

Food was fine but way too salty (not just us we watched someone else complain) the service from lady on front of house was excellent but the restaurant seemed to have run out of a lot of things including the gin, wine and a main course we wanted. This experience however was exceptionally good when compared to the visit to the pollen bar inside gardens by the bay the following day where we watched 4 groups of customers leave due to laughably poor and slow service I would recommend trying somewhere els

We had lunch at Pollen after Christmas. The restaurant has an different entrance from the main ticket entrance of the Flower Dome but one can visit the gardens after your meal by taking the elevator to the 2nd level of the restaurant. Note that the restaurant requires a credit card to guarantee a table of 6 or more people. We were led to a lovely table where we could enjoy being surrounded by the plants and rocks of the restaurant garden. We really enjoyed our meal. We opted to go straight to the main course although the $80 set lunch looked like a better value. Each a la carte dish was almost the same price as the set lunch ($65-74) but we really wanted to try the different mains. The delicious bread and canapes of salted olives and cod brandade made us look forward to the arrival of our dishes. We ordered the suckling pig, grilled rib eye, and the sea bream bouillabaise. All three dishes were fantastic. The suckling pig arrived topped with a crisp slice of pork skin and served with mashed potato flavored with gravy. The 300-day aged rib eye was succulent and flavorful and did not require the pepper sauce or bernaise sauce that came with it. The soup of the bouillabaise was poured on the plate on which the perfectly cooked fish was set. For dessert, the waiter recommended the lemon meringue with cucumber sorbet, which was surprising and very refreshing. Each dessert costs about $20 and the coffee will set you back another $9.50. The service was attentive without being in your face, allowing us to enjoy our conversation and our meal.We also enjoyed the buggy ride back to the main parking area. The manager drove us himself and even took the time to stop the tram to roll down the plastic covers when it started raining. Although it was a bit pricey (with wine and taxes it came out to about $125/head), the good food and attentive service would make coming here for a special occasion with good friends or family from overseas a good option

Met with friends for a belated birthday and pre Christmas dinner at Pollen,the saturday before Christmas.The festive menu was a substantial 8 course, with rather large portions for a tasting menu.Food was quite good but not great ,considering the hype and price being paid-about $30 for starters and $70 for mains. Although the place was not completely full, food service was slow, unattentive and service not up to par. Understandable as some of us ordered ala carte starters and mains, we had to wait a while to synchronize timing with the tasting menu, but even then , the tasting menu dishes were not cleared for a while after being finished, and the rest of us were waiting and waiting , and even when we asked for more water the waitress answered sweetly of course , but it never arrived. A little cake arrived to celebrate the birthday but an unsmilingowaitress served it with a bored face and waited impatiently for my friend to blow out the candle so that she could transfer it onto another plate. The desserts were served on chipped porcelain plates, which I feel was really unbecoming for fine dining. On the whole, disappointing but dishes that stood out were the squid risotto and the gazpacho starters which were lovely. I would have to reconsider seriously if I go back and probably do so only when it is not crowded ,and probably a week day lunch

Really enjoyed the golf buggy ride from the main carpark to the restaurant itself, where you got a new perspective on what is a very new part of Singapore. The concept of eating inside one of the flower gardens was innovative, although it has to be said you don't really feel a part of it until its time for dessert, when you can go upstairs and actually look out into the dome (Mediterranean flora). Food is tasty, but feel that similar quality meat is available for less elsewhere in Sing, although that said you do pay for a view. We had steak and suckling pig, portion size was a little on the small side, and it was almost overshadowed by the quality of the bread to start with

I am not sure what all the fuss is about. Sitting in the main restaurant you have no idea you are in a garden, other than the temperature. It is however nice to walk through the domed garden after your meal and see it. It's a pity it was near Christmas and they had put up tacky decorations.The food was presented beautifully but fell in to the category of trying to hard.One desert at our table had cucumber ice cream that did not fly with any of our group.Is the price worth it - No. but its not bad. Given we were told it was the hottest place in Singapore we were surprised to find it no that busy.Maybe the super fickle Singapore market has woken up to the high pricing and moved on

Very welcoming staff. Mostly serve drinks but can order a la carte.All we wanted was a light lunch- what a treat!Roasted beet salad first rate and fish and chips great.Coffee well blended and hot.You can wander into the gardens from the restaurant. A cool experience on a hot day. Recommend any time

Went for lunch with friends. When I callled the set menu was an already expensive $70++ but on arrival the "festive" menu was priced at $80++. And there was nothing festive about it. Strange combination of tastes - trying too hard to be fusion, starters were a fussy foam soup and the main was pork belly that was too fatty and too small to enjoy - all the portions were tiny - and the dessert was a teaspoon of ice cream with cherries in sauce. The staff were lovely but when the waiter split a glass of champagne it wasn't replaced which I thought was poor.The setting is beautiful but it's very expensive for what you get - with wine it worked out more than $120 each.Much better to enjoy the gardens and have lunch at home

The aptly named Pollen is situated in one of the domed Gardens by the Bay, most seats offer a Antarctic view of the skyline across Marina Bay. Also you get free entrance to the domed garden which normally comes at a cost. Another tip is to use the buggy pick up for the restaurant, they will drive you all the way to Marina Bay Sands if you ask.On to the food. The set lunch is expensive by Singapore standards, around $70 before taxes, but you get 3 courses and its worth it compared to a la carte prices where mains are around $60. I had the artichoke and scallops soup. It was delicious and the fried octopus topping was great. Fr the main I had the mushroom risotto, nice but nothing special. My friend had the lamb and that looked way more interesting. For dessert the two winners were the lemon meringue and the pistachio parfait. Both very deconstructed. The meringue dessert had no pie, it was a crisped meringue on top of softer whipped meringue. The cucumber ice cream complemented it well. The pistachio parfait was in a roll, served with a side of saffron ice cream on a bed of crumbly "brioche". We had plenty of yummy wine, not cheap at over $150 a bottle but good recommendations of the sommelier and served with style. Service was fantastic (although the American maitre d' somewhat surly) and seemed very "United Nations". Overall a good experience although lags a little in the food aspect (not to die for). I would probably go back, especially if someone else were paying

We went to Pollen for dinner. We did make use of the buggy from the main gate as it was hot and steamy and rain was threatening. The food and wine were excellent but the service could have been a little more polished. It was by no means bad but just one or two minor language misunderstandings with our server. Definitely worth a visit but make sure you have enough credit on your card

The set lunch at Pollen Restaurant is expensive by local standards @$70 Sing but well worth every cent for quality and service. Although the overall ambiance was restful it seemed, at a glance, a mismatched blend of woods and styles; more cafe than restaurant. However, the tables were well spaced and for once the wooden floor did NOT resonate with the clip clop of staff thundering around - a common problem in Singapore. We were shown to our table, served with style and efficiency : instantly offered menus & drinks and provided with a choice excellent bread, butter, a brandade de morue & large green olives : it was a good start. The set lunch is three courses with a choice of three dishes in each course. We chose Jerusalem artichoke soup with smoky aubergine puree and crispy squid & a crab cocktail with avocado puree and sweetcorn sorbet. The soup was good but could have done with a touch more subtle seasoning but the smoky flavours of the aubergine added real depth. I loved the crab cocktail and thought the (sweet) sweetcorn ice was a masterstroke but my partner thought it a little too much. We both had lamb for the main : a loin chop served alongside a slow cooked crumbed shoulder rissole naped with a lamb reduction all served with braised baby gem and celeriac. I've never been a fan of cooked lettuce but this was good - not bitter, almost sweet. An extra sweet of 'cheesecake' in a glass was served while waiting for pudding. The last course provided the masterpiece of the day - the Pollen version of a lemon meringue dessert which consisted of a cucumber ice sandwiched in-between a wet 'burnt' uncooked meringue and a crispy cooked intensely lemony meringue scattered with grated peel and freeze dried miniscule shards of black olives - an extremely odd but oddly perfect intense spike of another flavour. It looked good and tasted even better. Ending with complimentary petits fours which were refreshed when they noticed we'd cleared the plate, I couldn't fault the attention to detail. Washed down with a delightful Greek white from Santorini it was a good way to spend a couple of thoroughly enjoyable hours.Congratulations Pollen on being the only restaurant, in my experience, in Singapore which has a properly trained brigade - it made a difference

Heard the restaurant related to the one in Pollen St London and chef trained in El Bulli. Excellent dinner , did not disappoint. Had the tasting menu at $190++ / pax. Generous portion. Good wine select for pairing. First course was the poached egg - wonderful. Chef is very creative. Loved the tenderloin and beef cheek most. Was too full to eat the two desserts. Will return for special occasions. Restaurant is packed and need to be booked in advance. They have a bar upstairs with access to the flower dome. Beautiful view of the Singapore Flyer and MBS

The four of us dined here on a drizzling evening. Instead of the tasting menu, wedecided to order ala-carte and ordered all the more commented signatures :1. Poached egg with bacon - 6/10, we have tasted much intense ones in othermichellin restaurants. The egg was well-done, just not that wow enough.2. Roasted quail with foie gras - 6/10 nice but not memorable. 3. Crab cocktail with caviar - another pleasant but lacked the pizzazz to be worthremembering,,,,6/10.4. Iberico pork chop - the pork belly was not spiced long enough and lack flavour.Meat was tender, alright if not for the higher expectations.5. Roasted seabass - supposed to be one of the must-try signatures. The fish wasperfectly-cooked and moist but lacked taste. Perhaps the accompanying sauces helpedbut,,,7/10.6. Steak - cannot compare to those at the Cut 6/10. 7. Macaroons - 5/10, almost on par with what you can find along tonnes of OrchardRoad wannabes,8. Magnum with rum and raisin - this small house concoction (complimentary) turnedout to be my favourite, simple and wholesome. 8/10.9. Cognac and coffee concoction desert - came perched on a large stone, the portionwas super tiny but it was good. 9/10.10. Petit fours was a can-do-without affair. 3/10.And for a supposedly michellin-star place, they had 8 diff kinds of coffee and teabut no decaff. Ambience :1. Toss-up btw a high-end casual place and a formal dining place. Lighting was toodark to be casual or airy. Felt more formal and cosy and yet with no dress code,the diners were a mixed bag of clientele.2. It was supposed to be below 20C but on this drizzly day, it felt cooler outside.3. We asked to have our deserts by the chef's table whereby we can see the chefspreparing the desert for us directly in front of us. It also made us over-order thedeserts to patronise the fun they were having fixing up different deserts for theother guests.Service :Service whilst dining was fast and responsive. But service prior to the dinner wascold and curt. First, they couldn't find our reservation even though we had booked 2weeks in advance and had reconfirmed a week earlier. Secondly, the buggy pickup wasmissing and the same phone number (same as the reservation number) went straightinto a voice recording, esp not acceptable during official dining hours where allclient were expecting to be picked up.Overall the four of us spend 800 without wine. Well for a celebrity restaurant, itis cheap but we won't be back as there is really nothing really outstanding (nolightning and thunder, just pleasant pleasant pleasant but for a celebrityrestaurant, there was no wow factor at all). And for those going, we will recommendordering more of the starters and try more of the deserts but skip the nondescriptmains

The service is really good by Singapore standard - attentive waiting and decent services but the food is really a disappointment. The lime marinated mackerel was cold and tough. The Brittany cod was cooked just right but bland and tasteless (we had really good cod from Brittany in San Sebastian). The duck was cooked right and juicy but not outstanding. The deserts (at the bar) which were supposed to be the highlight were overrated
4
By Singapore standards this restaurant was slightly out of place as it was fairly european with a formal feel about it, yet in a relaxed location in the gardens.The food was modern but excellent as the produce was fresh and flavoursome. Staff were very attentive and slightly over attentive but that is the style they have intended.An excellent location, with great food and a wide and varied menu.I would go back and recommend it to others
3
This was a disappointing experience. The service in a restaurant of this supposed quality was very amateurish although they did try hard. Appetiser was tasty...Roasted quail “brunch”,foie gras on toast, cereals, quail tea. Main- Rack of lamb, braised shoulder, artichoke, sheep’s curd, roasted salsify, olive was rather bland and the roasted salsify and artichoke tasteless. Lamb tender but needed more flavour. Would not return.. $400 including wine - the hi-lite - the Malbec from Argentina but no dessert

We came to Pollen for a birthday dinner and were quite underwhelmed as we had been anticipating some great food. From the bar service (which was slow given that there were not many customers and a Mon night) where we had to request the bar staff to take our order, even though we were actually standing in front of them, at the bar! They also didn't know how to make a basic cocktail like a whiskey sour or a martini. You had to stick to the menu.We had the degustation - which had a promising start but went downhill from there. The 'amuse bouche' was announced and served, except that it wasn't an amuse bouche, it was actually the first course. We were confused so we asked again - the reply was it's the amuse bouche which is the first course (?). When it came to the meat course, 5 plates were served and one was missing. As it is polite to wait for the whole table to be served before eating, we were left for at least 10 mins waiting for the 6th plate. There was no explanation from the staff when they served 5 plates only so we finally had to ask - where is the 6th plate? Surely, it makes more sense to keep all the dishes in the kitchen (and warm) and then serve them all together? Also, the air con is so frosty that it didn't take long for the food to get cold. Finally when the 6th dish arrived, disappointingly, we had to send 2 plates back because the meat was overcooked. For a restaurant of this standard, cooking the meat properly should be a given. To their credit, they did provide us with complimentary glasses of moscato for the inconvenience.There was goats cheese overload but it was in the dessert! No one at the table could actually finish the desserts and we are all very adventurous eaters. The combination of truffles and goats cheese in the desserts just didn't work. Then there was more goats cheese in the soggy macarons which again, just didn't work.We were so excited about trying this place and it was a major disappointment - we would not be returning or recommending it - there are many better restaurants in Singapore. This restaurant seems to be trading off the Jason's name as a money spinner rather than actually serving good food

I was really excited leading up to dinner at Pollen. What was promised was a restaurant in the Flower Dome of the newly completed Gardens by the Bay. I imagined sitting in the arching dome, looking outwards into the bay with exotic plants allsorts around. The reality is that the bulk of the restaurant was located beneath a platform, so you get a low roof and a lookout into the path where joggers ran past.Being disappointed already by the setting, I pinned all my hopes on the food. This is THE Jason Atherton and having heard only good things about Pollen Street Social and really enjoying myself at Esquina, I was prepared for a real treat. Instead, the food were all kinda, strangely, unbalanced.I ordered a starter of a Trip Around Japan (or something like that) which has raw scallops on top of Daikon (japanese radish) topped with Uni. All I tasted was a slightly bitter Daikon that over-powered the rest of the dish. The other dishes that followed had the same flaw... The beetroot overpowered the venison in the Venison Tartare as well.Probably not going back again

Apt name for Jason Atherton's new restaurant at Gardens by the Bay & a sister property to Pollen Street Social. Really enjoyed the food at lunch time. Had the $60 set lunch menu which was excellent value considering Jason Atherton is a Michelin star chef. Also if you dine there, you get free entrance into the Flower Dome
5
We booked at 8 pm but arrived at 7 pm after walking around the Gardens by the Bay. The reception was confused and asked us to wait by the bar. I asked to talk to the Manager and she kindly showed us to the table. Apart from this little hiccup, the evening was memorable. The food were really good started with slow cooked egg. We have tried different slow cooked egg in restaurant in HK and London. this one is different as the egg was cooked and mixed with mushroom. This is followed by crab cocktail with avocado, sea bass, beef tenderloin with oxtail. Desert is being served by the bar with the chef preparing it in front of us. We were given two extra dishes. The service was equally good. Highly recommended

A little difficult to review. The food and presentaion is top class although some dishes I am not sure will stay on the menu for long. Dishes such as the Scallops and Slow Cooked Egg will stay forever! The service is very formal which is unusual in Singapore and for me, if it could relax a little, it would improve the ambience. The highlight was sitting at the dessert bar where we could watch the desserts being prepared and then praise the chef Andres and his very able and charming assistants. Desserts to die for! I will hurry back just to sit at the dessert bar again and sample more of the dishes.My overall view is that i much prefer the relaxed atmosphere in sister restaurant Esquina and some dishes equally as good if not better but we will be back for sure

The first problem was gaining access. It's fine if you're outside. There is a buggy service to deliver you to the main door. We were in the Flower Dome. There is a Pollen Cafe above the restaurant. We went in there. They told us to go down the steps to the floor below. The only steps had no access signs. After some time spent searching we went down those steps. These led into the rear of the restaurant, where a waiter asked why we had entered that way. "Desperation," I replied. Obviously the restaurant is air-conditioned. Any decent place in Singapore is. But they do rather take it to extremes. It's OK for the staff. They're wearing suits. Diners in shirt sleeves sitting still at temperatures below 20 celsius soon begin to feel chilly.The service is very good. The food is well-cooked and beautifully presented. Tables are well-spaced. The food, unlike the ambient temperature, is inspired by the Mediterranean. There is always a risk, to which the chef seems to have succumbed, to provide the unusual for the sake of it, rather than it being a natural pairing. My wife had the parsley soup, which she said was excellent, but with a slab of smoked sea trout in the middle of the soup bowl and balanced on the fish a deep-fried truffle egg, i.e. a lightly boiled egg that is deep-fried in a breadcrumb and truffle coating so that the yolk is still soft. Technically, its culinary virtuosity; whether the constituent parts are complimentary is another question. But, if you want experience of unusual dishes prepared with great expertise, give it a try

I've been to Pollen twice now, once for dinner to celebrate my birthday and again for the weekday set lunch ($55). Both times were fantastic. Jason Atherton has rounded up a phenomenal team and has created a space that truly matches his Michelin-starred London restaurant Pollen Street Social. Food is absolutely top-notch and the set lunch is fantastic value for money, featuring actual dishes from the a la carte menu rather than the cookie cutter items found at so many set lunches these days. I particularly enjoyed the excellent wine recommendations by sommelier Amir Solay and the famed dessert bar run by pastry chef AndrÃ©s Lara (ask to have your dessert at the bar!). I found the service on my first visit to be wanting due to a shortage of staff but on a return visit, the staff were efficient, attentive and one or two even remembered me from my previous visit and came to say hello! Great location and views of the Singapore skyline though I would have liked the feeling of being immersed in a "Mediterreanean garden" with more rustic, natural greenery rather than the polished perfection of wood. At any rate, this is a highly recommended Singapore dining spot and what better way to end a lunch than a walk though the beautiful Flower Dome

Its an obvious comment that a restaurant called Pollen should be located in the Flower Dome but it does provide a lovely backdrop to the food. We went at lunchtime and had the set menu which was decent value at $55. The "english breakfast" was inventive and not dissimilar to something that Heston Blumenthal might come up with. The main course beef was very tender and done medium rare as requested, something which many restaurants can't seem to do. The desserts were different, shall we say, and not all worked but all were beautifully presented. The service was very good, something which I note not all reviewers would agree with, although the restaurant has only been open 2 months so it might be teething problems. I've tried too many western eateries in Singapore which frankly serve average food at inflated prices but this establishment serves good food, well presented, and the price seems reasonable (at least if one has the set menu). Well worth trying
3
Had the tasting menu, and out of the 7 dishes, only thought that 3 dishes were good, and in fact thought one of the desserts was bad, which is not great for what should be a top-class restaurant by a celebrity chef. The service was very dodgy, and this is the first time in my experience that the sommelier described the house wine endorsed by Pollen as "no particular character, a very normal wine"... did not make the wine sound appealing at all. In addition to that, we were seated almost 2 hours late, even though we had made reservations, which again for a top-notch restaurant is unacceptable

Many would know that Pollen is situated in the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay. This is the only reason why you should visit the restaurant. If you are looking to enjoy a delicious meal and wonderful service, I would suggest you visit other restaurants in the area.The restaurant does offer buggy services from the information desk at the visitors centre to the restaurant itself.But once you step in the restaurant, the services that you would expect from fine dining restaurants end there.My husband and I went there with our baby daughter to celebrate my birthday. When we there, we were not explained the dishes offered and no recommendations were given. After we have ordered, bread only came a good 5 minutes later. Till date, the bread that I ate at Pollen was by far the hardest to chew and most difficult to swallow. It was not warm and the crust of the bread could really break a tooth. Thus, when we were offered more bread we declined even though we were quite hungry.The starters took another 8 - 10 minutes to be served. And we were quite shocked by the portions given. For a 30++ lobster salad, I would have expected more greens with a few pieces of lobster. But i got in total 6 pieces of small lettuce-like leaves with 3 pieces of lobster and a small swirl of noodles. The squid risotto was nice but the portion was really made for a 3-year old.After we were done with starters, we waited yet again for a good 10 minutes for our mains. None of the staff updated us on our dishes or apologized when it was served late. We both ordered fish dishes and when it arrived - we were again shocked at the portions of fish that was given for a $48 dish. Both dishes were really salty and I could not even compliment any part of the dish to make ourselves feel better. Once we were done with our meals, no staff offered the dessert menu or offered a slice of cake for my birthday. The ironic thing was, when we asked for the bill it came within a minute we asked for it. It felt as if they were shooing us off!! We left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied, hungry and truly dissapointed that $200++ were gone for a meal like that!We are definitely not recommending Pollen to any of our relatives or friends and we will definitely not come back ever

Had a little trouble finding the place as the person who took our reservation neglected to mention the buggy service from the Visitor's Centre. Even when we were literally behind the restaurant (inside the Flower Dome) the Pollen service staff we called couldn't explain how exactly to get to the restaurant entrance & told us to get out of the dome and walk from the exterior. Luckily we spotted the discreet side entrance of the restaurant within the dome & got to the restaurant without having to walk a big round. Aside from that hiccup, the wait staff that attended to us during our lunch were flawless. We had the set luch which was a pretty good deal - 3 courses for S$55++. We liked our slow cooked egg entree. Our pork belly main dish was ok & I enjoyed my lemon meringue dessert that came with a refreshing cucumber sorbet. We brought our 4-yr old to lunch there with us & our waiter kept her happy with a steady stream of sweet treats (all complimentary). Besides her treats & dessert, my little girl also appreciated the child-friendly loo complete with stylish kiddy sink. The ambience in Pollen is really lovely with views of the bay & Singapore Flyer...I would definitely return again now that I know exactly how to get there ;

Celebrated hubby's birthday at this 2-month-old restaurant. As we were early, we had the opportunity to tour the Flower Dome before dinner. We chose the a la carte menu and had the squid risotto & lobster salad for starters and for the mains, we had the ranger valley 300-day rib-eye and the marinated lamb cutlets. We highly recommend that you have the desserts at the dessert bar where you get to watch Pastry Chef Andres Laras prepare the exquisite desserts. The food was good but lacked the wow factor. Perhaps the restaurant should impose a dress code as we saw some of the diners dressed rather casually. Just a little suggestion

We visited Pollen restaurant for lunch and it was fabulous. My husband had the fixed lunch menu at only $52 - for 3 courses, I think. I chose a-la-carte which was about double the price but wanted to try certain dishes not on the fixed lunch menu. Wow - food was simply amazing. As the restaurant had only been open a month the chef made us extra desserts to try. I am a dessert queen so was in heaven. We tried 5 desserts in total and loved them all.Staff were still learning - very pleasant - but not that great at describing the dishes. Expect this will improve over time.Will definitely return on our next trip to Singapore
