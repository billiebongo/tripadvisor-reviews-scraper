We have been to 2 events organised by Andsoforth. Alice in Wonderland and Disco David. These events were held in a secret location, not as the address above suggests. Our first experience at Alice in Wonderland was an eye opener. There is nothing like this in Singapore! From the moment we arrived, we were brought into their world. The actors stayed true to their character while juggling to serve us our food. The performance was interactive and we were invited to participate in them. There were also rooms to explore. There was a tarot card reading, croquet, caricature drawing, and a room to make your own drinks. I can't think of any other restaurants in Singapore that does that. There was so much thought into making the affair an enjoyable one. One that allows you to forget about work, life and just relish the moment. That said, the service and atmosphere was obviously on point. I have to add that the make up of the actors was professionally done. The food was interesting. Like many others, I was initially taken aback by the look of the food. It was however delicious, and kudos to the chef for inventing the dishes to suit the theme. You definitely need to come with an open mind and remember that you are paying for the experience, not just the food. After our first experience, we decided to approach them to hold our wedding party there. The organisers were awesome! They were flexible and open to our suggestions. They empathised with the whole wedding shenanigans we have to go through and went the extra effort to change the script for our guests. They do not normally do it, but they also catered to our halal guests and even surprised us with a wedding game. Through engaging them, we realised how much effort was put into just organising for 1 night. Alot of logistics are involved with the actors, bartenders and kitchen staff. Our guests had such an enjoyable night that a few of them said it was the 'Best wedding ever!'.After our wedding party, they said they were going to tear down the whole set and introduce another theme. It was Disco David, the second event that we went for. Did not think that I could be more surprised but Disco David blew my mind! They changed the whole concept and the layout of the restaurant. We were treated to different rooms and every room brought a different dimension to our experience. The music coordinated with each room and we were like children again. The food was completely different (the chef must have took time to invent the dish to suit the theme) and was tasty. I was not so much a fan of the dessert, but i guess some would like it. Staying true to their concept and possibly values, this is really good heart stuff and hard heart work. Thank you Andsoforth team for putting everything together. God knows how they do it and so cool that we have this in Singapore (for now). Hope they keep on keeping on. They bring immersive dining and performance experience to another level! If you are lucky, you might be able to catch them while you are in singapore. Not sure when their next event will be, but this is one 'restaurant' (i think we need to invent a new word for them) that i would definitely recommend to anyone in singapore or coming to singapore. Always remember to go with an open mind and just have fun

I went with my partner and a bunch of friends to the latest production of Andsoforth, called DiscoDavid. It resulted in an unforgettable night of fun jokes, artistic arts, great cocktails and delicious food. I highly recommend such experience for anyone who is looking to get out of mainstream entertainment without getting too artsy

I had a great night with/at Disco David. The evening already starts nice as you get directions to a location of the beaten track. Once inside, we were indulged in several very nice dishes in unexpected situations and rooms, accompanied with funny and energetic acts and performances, and a lot of music so tacky it makes you happy :)Big round of applause for the performers, the cooks, and the organization of the event. Oh, and let's not forget the people behind the bar who served me a delicious cocktail

As a professional dancer I have a high expectation when it comes to any performance, be it amateur or professional. I went into this dinner theatre with high expectations and boy was I blown away. Having visited dinner theatre in the US previously I had an idea of what to expect. These types of shows are a rarity in Singapore as the scene here is quite small. My 3 favorite things about this experience, because that's what it is, an experience, were the food, actors and drinks. Every dish we had went with the themed room we were in. Without giving too much away, trying to eat in pitch dark while being seranaded was challenging and also fun. The food was surprisingly better than we expected and portion sizes were good. The theme we attended was The Imaginarium of Disco David. This was right up my alley as there was a lot of dancing and good music involved in the show. The performers stayed in character the whole time, I mean the whole time. This adds to the whole feel of the place. There was some really talented singers and dancers. Prepare yourself for the last room. It's a full on production. Don't go with people who don't have an open mind as this is a very immersive and fun experience that takes you a bit out of your comfort zone but in a good way. Was very impressed with the caliber of talent. Lastly, while the wine list is not extensive, honestly I didn't expect it to be I mean it is dinner theatre not a 5 star restaurant, the drinks served were good. We got a welcome shot and a goodbye shot if we tagged them in a post on Facebook or twitter which is a pretty good deal to me. We are looking foward to their next production so we can go again. It was the perfect date night idea.

The cast tried their very best to make this an immersive Alice in Wonderland theatre experience but unfortunately it was a case with a good concept but lousy execution. The 2 hour experience read like a juvenile orientation camp, with a petulant whiny Alice and cast members who found it quite difficult to improvise spontaneously. Some highlights were the frog and Cheshire Cat characters who did their parts the best out of the lot.The food was extremely disappointing- we had an ok mushroom broth soup; a limp unseasoned beetroot salad; mushy sous vide chicken with an out of place piece of (charred yet raw) cabbage with burnt rice; and ended with petrified sponge and chocolate. For the 90 dollars ticket price, this was a poor way to spend the evening.

had to change dates as work schedules real hectic. organisers extremely rude and condescending when needed to do second change. basically its a no refund , pay me upfront and i dont care and too bad.. go find someone else to take your place, even if the booking is one month ahead, our costs are already sunked in....which is highly unlikely in today's age and also reality....extremely unpleasant experience for us...we decided to give it a miss and passed the tickets to other folks and treated the expense as a very unlucky one..

They change shows every 3 months, we saw "THE SPY, THE THUG, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER", given that space is a premium in Singapore and arts is still emerging in comparison to say London, Melbourne or New York, the production was well put together, with room for improvement but the Ladies and Gentlemen performing were awesome and quick witted.The evening as whole was very good and worth the effort to be there. A very Singaporean take on an immersive performance and dining experience. Audience are active participants including participation in plot etc. Best to go in a group of friends that are a majority of extroverts :)The food was quite good, the only downer was a polenta ball dish, most Asians in the room also weren't fans - Arancini Balls would have killed it much better.Wines available could have been better, but the beer was ICE cold - so all good by me.Unlike many other immersive dinners, all participants are urged to share on multimedia, plenty can be found looking for #andsoforth I highly recommend if for only one reason - supporting arts in Singapore is so important, but fortunately there is more than one reason, the cuisine was better than expected and the experience was awesome, all the actors and staff were fantastic - a lovely team that we can't wait to visit for the next round

Andsoforth is a secret dinner cum theatre experience that excites both the senses and the palate. The location, menu and entertainment change every time, which is a reflection of the inventiveness and ingenuity of the creators. While the scripts may not be as fully polished as a dinner theatre show in London's West End, yet the food is consistently good, they always come up with themed cocktails and one can always expect to meet new and interesting people at the dinner. I'm excited to see what they will come up with next
