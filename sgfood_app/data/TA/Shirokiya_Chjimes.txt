Good place to chill! We had few drinks at Chjimes, the area look good, nice to seat outside and chill, good live music and lot of people dancing, central location lots of restaurant around.... perfect to start a good night out!

Located centrally in the Chijmes complex, it is one of many that you can choose from. Good quality sushi at reasonable prices for Singapore. Not outstanding but good food - lively noisy but quick and easy.

I had a quick dinner at Chjimes (Prive) with a coworker while on a recent business trip to Singapore. The service was quick, friendly, and efficient, and the food was delicious. We had the beef and the chicken, both served with rice. There was plenty of food, and it was very fresh and tasty. The ambiance at this place (a grouping of restaurants) is really special, as we ate al fresco under mini-lights and trees. We were very close to a kind of open square with cushions, where I'm told they offer movies under the stars. Overall, a really interesting, fun place

We loved everything we ordered but the grilled chicken and BBQ pork belly were especially tasty. Really wonderful actually. We also had Kim chi udon which was very nice as were the veggie sides. A pint of cold Kirin was the perfect companion to this meal.

The whole family decided to go there for lunch using the JPassport deals. Between 4 of us, we had 2 JPassport accounts and wanted to order 2 discounted sets.The service staff refused to allow 2 sets in a single table. We suggested splitting into 2 tables. In the end, the family was fine to order a set, but the manager was so rude that we left the restaurant

The charcoal grilled chicken is a far cry from what they recommended . The presented chicken is something I can do at home myself. I'm not a good cook . So i had wish this restaurant could do better . I had a fright when it was placed on my table. I was too shock to react and even take a photo. I guess The variety of the food they present disallow them to focus on the gem . What a pity . The Rich chicken stock soup ramen with collagen fell extremely short of what a real chicken stock should be . The noodle is too dense for any ramen I have ever eaten. The tuna sushi is a total failure . The rice has no vinegar and the Tuna is definitely not cut by a professional sushi chef . Only the pork rice serve in hot stone is worthy of its value . Sigh ... .... okay at least the ginger beer I ordered in the end cools me down

Chjimes has been refurbished and must be Singapores secret it is the most fabulously done area with lots of different restaurants we went on a Thursday and the whole area was busy . I think more needs to be done to promote the area because it really is lovely it is across the road from the Famous Raffles hotel so please anyone looking for a dining experience in Singapore go there and check it out

This restaurant is located within Cjimes.Is this restaurant at lunchtime and requested a quiet seat. The waitress found us a booth seat at the back of the restaurant. Whilst quiet however you're not in direct view of the waitresses all the time and this can lead to some delays in being served.The air-conditioning was especially good. There was Wi-Fi available. There is no toilet in the restaurant and one has to walk at little way to find one.I ordered the curry Katsu main course set. It was very tasty and enjoyable. The ambiance is good but service maybe not quite as attentive as it should be. Nice place to stop for a meal, reasonable price - would return again if I were in the area.

If not for the taste of their food...this restaurant will not earn a 3 star review. We had early dinner at this restaurant and ordered 3 dishes which were: Roasted BBQ Pork (Korukota), Salted Grilled Mackerel and Fried Rice with Crab Meat.The food was delicious and had the real authentic taste. But the dishes were served intermittently and we have to wait for another 10 minutes before the Fried Rice was served (making our other dishes cold).Anyways, the disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered Green Tea Parfait.We got 2 scoops of 1 Green Tea ice cream and another scoop of ice cream, which I think is Brown Rice ice cream and then topped with red beans. The rest of the cup is then filled with cereals. How can a parfait contain 70% of cereals? Seriously
