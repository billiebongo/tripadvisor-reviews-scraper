Look rather unimpressive from the exterior. But they serve great tau huay that melts in your mouth. Sit inside the store unless u prefer to see the car zoom by sitting alfresco.

This stall has been there for sometime. It serves hot and cold beancurd drink, beancurd, grass jelly, some delicious chinese floured finger food which I personally like it with coffee. You can choose the drinks and the beancurd with no to more sugar depending on your taste buds and healthy living. It is about a few a small place with a few seaters. This stall is about another 10meters from the opposite row of Jalan Berseh Food Court with the flow of te traffic
