If u need nice stir fry "zi cha" dishes at wee hours, do drop by. Resonable price with tasty dishes.

Found this place after searching for a late lunch & not much was open. They were very accomodating & we had
great BBQ prawns & wonderful Sri Lankan chilli crab,
Not too spicy. Great location on the water, very relaxing!

Late Lunch, superb service and food was Delicious, would highly recommend the Sri Lanka Mud Crab and Tiger Prawns

Nothing flash about this place, red plastic chairs and yellow tablecloths but the food is very nice. We found the menu a bit daunting but selected a few "safer" Western options and thought they were delicious and great value.

My wife and I have been trying to find a nice fish steamboat and this restaurant definitely made our list. What is unique is that the fish is carved nicely and served on a plate. You then put the portion you like into the hot pot. The soup is tasty and you have a wide choice from the menu to order your extras and side dishes.

I have been some Seafood restaurants in Singapore and some of them were for tourts, quite expensive. However, this resaurant was for local. Chili club was authentic and yammy. I enjoyed fried rice and garlic oyster aside from Chili club.I also enjoyed lively atmosphere of Saturday night. I walked from Thong Bahru MRT station. It took about 10 minutes.

this place is located on the Outram road, nothing exclusive look wise or location wise. Its has small tables placed on the road. The collection of sea food is quiet exquisite. Do not expect anything 5 star but local food tastes good. We tried the chilli singapore crab was the best. rest of the sea food items are worth a try

Having read the reviews and hankering for “zi char”/ Chinese food, we ordered a large crab cooked (supposedly) black pepper styled and a sliced fish hor fun/ flat noodles. Maybe the chef was having an off day, both dishes could definitely do with more salt. Pricing wise, it’s more economical than close-by, better known Sin Hoi San, Por Kee and Golden Spoon. However you’re paying for what you get. Don’t bother ordering any of the crab dish, this is severely over-priced, you’re better off going other restaurants for this one speciality dish.

We were 3, in a business dinner. Be careful when you order because they charge all seafood by weight, with a wide range of price per kg for small/medium/large size seafood. If you just order by dish name, they will charge you by the highest per kg price. Do Note, I'm referring to the price per kg, not per dish. The fish on the photo was charged $80, the chili crab was charged $93, clams charged at $14 each ($42). Spent $278 for an uncomfortable side road dine. At this price, you rather go to a 5 star dining experience.

I realised that some reviews confused a "Tian Tian Fisherman's Pier" which is located at Boat Quay with "Tian Tian Seafood Restaurant" which is located at Outram. Located along the busy outram road, there is no river view, diners even have to seat along the walkway but the food is really delicious! It is not a fancy place but they do deliver the taste. They serve a variety of seafood, zi char dishes and also offer steamboat option. The price though not the cheapest but definitely not exorbitant. My favour is their garlic butterfly prawns! If you are a fan of garlic do try it! The fresh and succulent prawns tastes great, paired with the fragrance of the garlic. Must try

Bamboo clams and squid with salted eggs were fantastic. Best squid I've eaten so far anywhere in a number of countries I've been to.
This restaurant is very popular during dinner time.

The food here is very good with a variety of seafood but also great vegetable dishes. It was a great way to experience the local fare and close to our hotel (the Wangz!)
3
The food was good easy to get to for the first night but it is very expensive by local standards can do better for the price
5
Love all the dishes at this joint! From the simple hor fan and fried rice to exotic seafood dishes like bamboo clams, geoduck, etc. It is one of the most value for money restaurants in the same stretch of restaurants along Outram Road as well.
1
I can't rate the food at this restaurant because it took so long to come we left. One meat dish arrived.... Very small portions....and we waited 30 minutes but still no rice.
3
Just simple fried noodle and a fish with vegie, nothing special, just normal Chinese food. Price is on average side
4
Went with friends (with their children) and had a super meal. It may have helped because one of our friends ordered all the dishes. Everything was fresh, well cooked and what I consider to be big portions! 7 adults, 2 kids and 6 dishes with food left over!I especially enjoyed the fresh fried prawns, the whole fish and the bbq pork dishes (the fried calamari -- though it's called something a little different) was super also. Don't expect fancy cuisine, high quality furnishings or servers attuned to your every demand. However, do expect attentive service, great food, a fun place to go with friends and famil

We come to this place once every few months, it's popular with tourists and locals looking for a good variety of seafood dishes and steamboat. Tonight , we had the steam grouper Hong Kong style, must say the live fish was fresh, tender and cooked to perfection. We also had clay pot chicken and garlic clamps, overall we had a satisfying and enjoyable meal. Do drop by the restaurant for their local style seafood if you are in the Tiong Bahru area, their live seafood are unbelievably fresh

We were given a table next to the river, perfect setting. Menu was a bit confusing but we accepted the recommendation and went for a Sri Lankin crab for two. We chose the ginger and spring onion option. Also mini shrimp starters. The food was absolutely fantastic, loads of meat for us. The wine however was, although fine, horrendously expensive at $80 for the cheapest white! When in Rome though.....so we had it all and it was really nice. Great setting, great food, nice wine, but expensive at nearly $300 or £165 for two. No desert either! However we're only here once, and it was good. Recommended if you've got the cash

This place has a great location so plus points must go for this reason. However the food is very mediocre and not exactly fresh given that it is a seafood restaurant. I found the service quite abrupt, the pricing structure isn’t made clear from the offset (make sure you specific portion sizes) because we certainly didn’t and were given jumbo orders of everything and got charged accordingly. It was the most expensive meal we had in Singapore and this includes us eating at Spago! Definitely not worth the money. Save your pennies!

The food is good but you can't help but notice lots of shark fin dishes on the menu. Many sharks belong to endangered species - I'm sure the restaurant would do just as good without serving shark fin stuff.
5
It looks like a ordinary coffeeshop but the cuisines served was almost close to a high class restaurant standard.
All food is good. My favourite is the Fried Fish Skin and the Claypot Pork's Liver. Yummy!
4
Cilli crab was so good with reasonable price. It's still high price though. Nice place if you would like to try something local.
3
This place is a dive, tables are on the sidewalk of a busy street, but widely popular, as all tables were full the time we were there. Food is so-so, we ordered the "large" black peppered crab, taste was nothing special.. Crab+noodles+veggie came to around SGD 100.
4
Lovely restaurant and especially if you get a table right on the water's edge overlooking the river. The 'draw' was the huge tank of crabs and lobsters on the waterside walk....and when you stop to look at them, you 'get netted' as well with a very tempting menu card. They do a specials board but pricey drinks bump up the price quite a bit, although the first one was 'free' with the order.

Came here last night since it's only walking distance from my hotel. The hotpot looked good but since I was by myself I ordered few light dishes: fresh oyster, steam garlic bamboo clam and boiled fresh prawn. Served with 3 dipping sauces: hongkong style light seafood sauce, pickle chilli soy sauce, and seafood chilli sauce (my favourite of the dinner, garlicky tangy and just delicious). I had a fabuolus eating experience

This restaurant was right by our hotel, very crowded with locals so we decided to give it a try. We had to wait to be seated and were then directed to a table to share. No one spoke English. Luckily, our table mates - a young couple with a child- spoke English, saw our confusion and helped us order. There are signs with pictures of the various dishes. We had a mixed seafood grill...too much sea cucumber for our taste. The rest was very good. We went back the next day and had another very good meal. The restaurant has indoor seating but we ate at a table on the sidewalk. We were amazed at the number of cars that pulled up so people could pick up their take out orders. A good sign
1
The restaurant staff heckle strongly to get people to eat at their restaurants along the quay (3 of them belong to the same owner) offering 2 free drinks. No wonder... The drinks go nowhere near compensating for the cost of the fresh seafood. We liked the location and my host contemplated the seafood. The staff upsold the seafood and this resulted in a discussion about what size would suit. When we asked about the price they only give you the weight which is in kilos while the price on the menu is in grams. It was a rookie mistake but the staff also sell it in a misleading way. We ended up with a bill of $630+ for 3 people. We won't be going there again.

Always hard to decide which place along here. Got it wrong this time. Food was just average, prices creeping seriously high for whats offered and some of our food and drinks never arrived, although they appeared on the bill, along with other over charges. Maybe we just struck a bad night, but I would try elsewhere
5
It was a quick Singapore trip and we will not miss to dine here before leaving Singapore. The seafood fried rice, live deep fried Soon Hock and salted egg covered prawns/squid are to die for. Indoor and sidewalk dining. There's also dining tables at the back street. This is not a fancy restaurant, but the food is delicious
5
I eat at this restaurant a couple of times a week. Stir fried hor fun or mee hoon with eggs and seafood or chicken or beef - just at $5. If you a small eater, it can feed two persons. Their live crab beehoon - try it with stir fried spring onions - range from $25++ onwards compared to some restaurants which will charge a minimum of $60 or $80. Bittergourd with fish head is also good
4
for the ubiquitous singapore chilli crab, i learnt that the best is made of crab imported from sri lanka! it doesn't come cheap but at $10 per gm, with a few other dishes to spare it is succulent, gigantic, easily fed 5. it truly was a feast.i also tasted the unusual but tasty cereal prawns, deep fried with oats, curry leaves, chilli and much garlic.try the round japanese tofu dish - that is also delicious
4
Had the Shrimp with Vegetable and it was fresh and excellent. I wish i cld have ordered the fish as well but i couldn't have finished it all. Service was good and the waiter was very helpful in making my choice. Should go if you are staying in the nearby are

After a long days of travel tied and Hungry we were looking for a good place to eat asked the concierge for some suggestions near the hotel They pointed us up the road. Walked about 5-10 min and saw a small group of food shops. checked out the shops and by far the busiest was the Tian Tian Seafood RestaurantLocals galore we stepped up and got seated inside near the live tanks of seafood. Now this is a local restaurant that does not have the airs and graces of a western restaurant its a hole in the wall with simple tables with good food Enjoyed the atmosfear sitting near the kitchen with the smells Great place to start our adventur

We were brought here my school mate and her husband and very enthusiast when we saw fresh seafood in front of the restaurant. We also saw lot of people inside and outside restaurant, which made us more excited.And...yeahh...two thumbs up, we love everything that we tried, grilled fish, crabs, veggie. Will definitely come back

I had the opportunity to have dinner with a Singaporean friend at this restaurant during my recent stay at the Wangz Hotel- located within meters from this restaurant. This is a typical local restaurant offering some great fresh seafood! My friend ordered in Chinese a number of seafood and fish dishes accompanied by noodles and some local beer. The restaurant nothing fancy was very busy with local clientele! Excellent value
4
This streetside restaurant is located next to the Wangz Hotel. It is a late night gem with fresh seafood. There is no ambiance and the wine/beer selection very limited but the food is terrific.The seafood is fresh from the tanks and the meats/poultry were excellent. We had Singapore Chilli Shrimp in lieu of the crab which was great - right level of spice. Fried rice, calamari and other entrees were equally good.If you don't mind siting on the sidewalk next to a busy street it's a must for you

I've been to mainland China many times, for business and leisure. And 'Tian Tian' made me feel being back there. The restaurant is 30 seconds walk from the Wangz hotel and offers some outside tables. We ordered some Cereal Shrimps, Beef in black pepper sauce, a sour-spicy soup with noddles, Morning Glory and some more rice noodles. Everything, really everything was very, very good, not out of this world - but authentic.The food was very good, plenty for 2. On the end we paid below SIN$ 60, a very good price for the food served
5
We always visit Outram Road when we arrive in Singapore late at night. This place had the best cuttlefish I have ever had, my husband remarked that it was the 'best dish he had ever tasted'. All other dishes were great, the service was wonderful and we even got some free satay from the 'Uncles' sat nearby

I have been going to Tian Tian for 10 years. Each year I come back the staff and food have always remained the same quality. The Freashest and the best cooked. Nothing is under cooked, nor over cooked,. but just rite. The fried rice is to die for, is just melts in your mouth. If your scared to is to the side walk, forget it, it is a must see seafood restaurant. You can walk out after a feast for less than $SING 100 and not be disappointed
