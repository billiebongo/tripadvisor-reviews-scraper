We tried it because we were staying in the service appartment nearby.It doesn't look nice.But it it is very good!Actually this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore now.We moved to an appartment far away, but we often come back for the food

This was the first place we ate at when we landed in Singapore, we have been back four or five times already, it looks pretty ordinary, nothing to tempt one in at all, the service is so so too, as in the guy tries really hard he is just someone who is not cut out to be front of house, pleasant enough though, the food and the value is the reason to eat here, we have never left feeling anything other than uncomfortably full and have never had a bill over $35 SD, it is a dry restaurant, we usually just stick with bottled water, really simple well cooked authentic North Indian food, at this value it is simply too good to pass by, it is on the first floor of a large building with all out door seating, the views are nothing to write home about and there are people literally walking past all the time, a real pavement eating experience. try it, we will be back for sure
