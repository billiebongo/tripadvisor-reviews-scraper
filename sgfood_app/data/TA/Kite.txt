The restaurant only offers set menus for dinner. The food was really amazing and was quite different. However, the staff was really rude.

Kite has renovated and to pay for it now offers only set menus. I hate that. Food is good, but if you don't want it all...
Time to fund another restaurant.

Popped in here today for some coffee after lunch. No pretty little design but still quite decent coffee. Good atmosphere and conveniently located. Worth another visit.

Came here for lunch recently and opted for the 3 course set menu (headline price of 32++ but ends up costing more once you add extra charges for certain options). The food was really very good, but the sizes were quite small. I ended up being quite hungry afterwards

I had the lunch set menu start from 32 for 3 courses. I order Ubin red snapper cerviche ( need some acid , slightly on the bitter side) , I have the Wagyu char Siew ( I wish the rice was hot and not dry : add the Wagyu fat , I hope to have some crispy smoke around the Wagyu burn bits) and my Favourite dish is the mangalica pork collard ( interesting about youtiao velouté and spice broth with interesting small pop corn ). I hope this restaurant will make the Flavours pop more.

Had the Executive Set Lunch (3 courses) and chose Salmon Trout 42degrees, Wagyu Char Siew and Yuzu Curd. The freshly baked homemade bread offered after orders were taken was a promising start to the meal. Although portions aren't big, every dish was very flavourful and a delight on the palate. Friend offered a bite of the Mentaiko Somen, which was delicious as well. Service staff were attentive and always ensured our glasses were filled with water (a simple thing that many eateries neglect). I also liked that the plates and bowls used were different for every diner, even if we had ordered the same dish. Enjoyed the dining experience at Kite and would return to try the other dishes

This is a really great little gem which feels super casual but the food is really extraordinary. The plates are small but it's really very much a fine dining experience so standard for that... just don't go expecting to be stuffed when you leave. Incredible flavours and super fresh dishes though

We had only 6 hours in Singapore, so wanted to have a good food/experience before taking the next flight. Kite Restaurant was the perfect place to be! Crew Kite is extremely helpful and they even offered an Omakase menu for us given the circumstances. We could find the restaurant pretty easily, located in a very nice/hipster part of town. Service was pleasant, had tried nearly (sharing menu) 9 dishes, 2 desserts, nice cocktails for 170 SGD. Dishes were products of creative minds but also reflected simplicity. Waitress was nice enough to suggest us cocktails which would go along. We particularly loved the use of flowers in the dishes, especially the last dessert. Portions were relatively small but when we left the restaurant we were already full and luckily not feeling too heavy. Chef Dannel came over for a short chat during the service, and William made us feel really comfortable. He also brought us to a Speak-Easy sort of bar in the same street and had more cocktails together. If you are bored of Sky 57 sort of good view/average food restaurants, Kite Restaurant is your place with its nice design, fresh vibe and good food

We had a lot of food in tiny portions， all of which I was happy with. The good came slowly which was a bit frustrating as we were really hungry. After 3 or 4 rounds of tiny dishes we calmed down a bit. The forest desert was amazing and delicious and everything was great especially the wagyu beef. Had a great time ther

5 people job lunch. Choice between tapas or lunch format dishes. I had risotto - good taste but loose consistency and felt more like boiled rice in cream sauce. My colleagues had trout and noodles. Looked quite nice. All sounded to appreciate. Portions are moderate size. Service was friendly and prompt. Will go back
