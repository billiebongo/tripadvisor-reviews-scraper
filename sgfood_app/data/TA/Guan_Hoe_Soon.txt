We are a Peranakan family who has repeatedly gone back to Guan Hoe Soon for our fix of good, authentic Peranakan food at a reasonable price. Most recently, we visited with a Japanese friend who loved the food and the experience. Our favourite dishes are the Ayam Buah Keluak and Babi Pongteh, and these never disappoint. Thank you Guan Hoe Soon

Review by DrSIm001. Good Peranakan Food. Peranakan are basically people that married the local natives. Also known as Straits Born Chinese. Peranakan Food are basically Chinese style food with Malay influence. Decent Service. AIr-Conditioned. Pleasant ambience. Tourists can consider. Hard to access for Tourists. You have to take a taxi. About S$20 per pax. Regards DrSim00

This is one of the best Nonya Restaurant That I ever patronised. It has numerous delicious Nonya dishes that you can order. Especially great for you if you love spicy food. We had a hearty meal and everyone were commenting how authentic the dishes were that reminded them of what their grandparents cooked for them. Though some dishes may look spicy but actually they taste fine - I meant delicious and not hot. So just ask the helpful waiter and waitresses for their advice and recommendations. Price is like any other restaurant so I will say it is really worth it. The food were so delicious that I didnâ€™t really manage to take good pics as they were taken in seconds

Friend raved about this place and we decide to have a gathering for party of 10 when a mutual friend came back from UK for a short vacation. The place was not crowded when we went there for dinner on a thu evening. We ordered their Assam fish, chap chay, sambal kangkong, chicken bukulat, ngoh hiang, omelette, squid, fish maw and meatball soup, lady's fingers and some other dishes. The vegetables were ok, squid and soup were good. Chicken was not too bad as well. But the Assam fish was a disappointment. The fish did not taste fresh and the assam was taste more of sourish pineapple rather than assam. We also ordered dessert and the bill came up to $400+, which I thought was quite pricey as we ordered more vegetables rather than meat dishes as one of my friends was a vegan. The service was the staff was ok and the restaurant did not charge for corkage as we brought a bottle of wine along. Was a bit disappointed about the quality of food as restaurant is supposed to be one of the oldest peranakan restaurant in Singapore.

We ordered the signature dish - Assam Fish and expected to experience what others have told me about this place. The fish looked great when it was served but the first bite already told me that this fish was not fresh. I told the waiter about the smelly fish but he just insisted that the fish is fresh without bothering to offer to check or let his chef examine it. As a result of this, the entire experience was a disappointment. The Ngo Hiang and beef rendang were tasty, but we felt the smelly fish and the lack of interest from the management /waiters to evaluate a legitimate customer feedback shows they don't care

~Christine was having her farewell at the oldest Peranakan restaurant in Singapore, getting there for lunch wasn't the problem, it was the single lane parking in those streets off Joo Chiat Road that will test your driving patience at noon!~lunch was fabulous with so many people round the table we ordered all the favorites and oh the dishes were of Nonya Baba = Peranakan cuisine inspired by the Chinese & Malay inter marriages of the straits settlements especially near Malaccawith a Chinese Menu AND Nonya Menu there are just too many dishes to name and most of the Nonya ones come with a little spice, ask if you prefer more mild dishes& always try every dish on the dessert menu, my favorite is Sago Gula Melaka a sweet palm sugar infused coconut milk on sago palm seeds that whets your creamy rich taste buds like chocolate but better!definitely a place for people to come taste a wholesome culture

Guan Hoe Soon restaurant This restaurant is located at Joo Chiat lane and it is definitely the oldest Peranakan Restaurant in Singapore this place has been serving good and authentic Peranakan food since the 1950s. Although the restaurant's location was out of the way, it didn't stopped regulars from making their way there. The manageress was delightful and made lots of suggestions, all of which we followed. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced, and the drinks are cheap. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

One of the oldest and better restaurants for genuine and delicious nonya food. Must try their signature dishes like Ayam buah keluak, Assam fish, chap Chye, Bak Wan kepeting and many more. Ambience is good and staff are friendly. Weekday lunches are the best as there is no need to book a table

Guan Hoe Soon is a restaurant in the Joo Choit Quarter of Singapore City, which is home to the Peranakan Chinese community.These were among the earliest Chinese settlers in Singapore, and over the centuries have developed their own fusion food, which is a cross between Chinese, Malay and other regional influenced.We had Ikan Bakar, grilled fish with fermented sauce, Udang Asam Pedas, sour and spicy prawns, Bak Wan Kerpitang, crab and pork meat balls in soup, Ayam Buah Keluak, chicken in bean sauce, and Teruna Tau Lu, eggplant with fermented fish sauce.Along with a couple of Tiger beers and a water melon fruit drink, the bill for three of us was S$134

More of a family style restaurant. Food is tasty and serving portions quite reasonable. If you like dishes with coconut milk you will enjoy dining here.

The Restaurant serves variety types of Authentic Nonya Cuisine. After the meal, don't forget to order the dessert to complete your wonderful meal.

Been here about 4 times in 3 weeks. Absolutely delicious food. Must try ayam buah keluAk, otak otak, chap chye, sambal bendir and sambal udang. Sambal bendir is my personal favourite along with buah keluak. Can get really crowded on weekends. Thumbs up!

Lee Kuan Yew's favourite Peranakan Restaurant, this place has been serving good and authentic Peranakan food since the 1950s.The dishes you should have are the off menu babi pangang, the Chendol or Sago Gula Melaka, the babi pontay, the zup chai and the ayam buah keluak. There are not pretentious but delicious and authentic.The place is small so I would suggest making a reservation a couple of days before you head there.The service is so so but for the price, I can forgive since Peranakan food in Singapore is not cheap.Finally, if you drive (public transport is not really that great), you can park near the Chinese temple, there are ample parking and it's only 2-3 minutes walk

After reading the reviews here, I tend to agree with most that the service of the staff needs to improve. For our case, we were served twice food which we did not order. Fortunately we were alert and told the staff who brought back the food. Otherwise, we quite enjoyed the food

Guan Hoe Soon restaurant was highly recommended so perhaps there was a degree of high expectation. The food was good but not exceptional. We had about 6 dishes. The ngoh hiang was a little oily and the babi pagang was crispy but not flavoursome. The bawang kepenting was missing the flavours too. The assam fish was good. I was looking forward to the nonya noodles, hmmm .... rather bland. Service was polite but staff lacked experience. I will probably return again but not in a rush

This Restaurant have being serving authentic peranakan food since 1963. During my grand parents time and not forgetting they also cater for my grandparents wedding. Till today they still cater for many functions for office, school, churches and many more occasions. Try it don't miss it.

So we decided to have a dinner here on 14-Feb, coincidentally it's a traditional 'family day' for our Chinese customs. Therefore the place was very crowded. We made a reservation bout 2 weeks in advance for a table of 8 and upon arriving, we were given a table good enough for 6. And when we asked for a bigger table and said that we DID make a reservation, one female staff snobbishly claimed 'everyone also made reservation'. Well, a case of "wearing a hat that is a few sizes too large" I reckon. So amidst all the hustling and bustling within the restaurant, we ordered our food and it all came pretty quickly. And it was very decent to be honest. Then came the horror. We ordered a Rendang Pork and was served that as our first dish. It was towards the end of the dinner that a staff came over and claimed that the dish was served by mistake and it wasn't ours. We promptly asked what it was and they claimed it was BEEF. As many of us do not consume beef due to religious beliefs, we were very taken aback and demanded an explanation. Two of the staffs just merely said 'it's too crowded today and we are too busy with the orders' and WALKED AWAY. To me, this is highly unacceptable. What if they have served pork to any Muslim customers? It might not seem that important to us Chinese, but it is basic respect in this aspect. A very big pity as the food would have been a highlight of the day. But this family restaurant needs to keep themselves in check.

Shared the curry fish head, assam pomfret, otah otah, sambal kangkong. The big sized dishes are really generous, enough to feed six very hungry diners. The pomfret is particularly good. It is fresh and juicy. Otah Otah is light but flavorful. Try the Chendol dessert here too - it is really good with rich coconut and taro flavours. Seating is spacious enough. We were not charged for corkage, but they do not have proper wine glasses

I have to admit that this review might be worded in stronger language - what with my friend promising that this place served the best Peranakan food in Singapore and all. However, the taste of the food was exactly as I will now describe.Stewed pork: tasted fine, cooked in a style very similar to Chinese. Nothing to rave about, but certainly not horrible.Chicken with kepayang seed: the contents of the seed tasted interesting. Chicken was cooked fine but the gravy used to garnish was very bland.Sambal kangkong: not spicy enough, which is amusing as my tolerance is absurdly low. Could use a little more salt. Below par compared to the same dish at zhi char shops. Stewed cabbage with mushroom and fungus: worst of the lot. Overcooked and tasted slightly burnt. Service was pretty bad with the waiters forgetting that we'd ordered drinks, then informing us that they were out of coconuts when we alerted them in the middle of our meal. For the price we paid, the quality and serving size of the dishes were atrocious. Can get better food at neighbourhood zi char joints

Authentic Peranakan food. My favourite restaurant that serves Peranakan food with a less commercialised feel.
Must try Ayam Bua Keluah, Sayor lodeh, Babi ponteng, steamed Assam fish,Sambal kangkong
3
We ordered the Assam fish and chicken buah keluah and Ngor Hiang etc. Some dishes tasted salty and we could not eat it. Others were ok. Standard seems to have fallen from some years ago when I last visited

Much more expensive than Chilli Padi down the road. But the rempah appears to be more thoughtfully prepared. Nice and rich keluak and pineapple prawns.

Great peranakan food. Love their Ayam bear kelua, Babi ponteng, sayur lodeh, Assam fish, sambas kangkong

As a regular here, I closely monitor the quality of the dishes. We tried a few new dishes. The pomfret assam pedas was divine. The fish was smooth and tender, bathed in a delicious assam sauce. The bak wan kepeting was also lovely and bouncy. While the babi assam 's sauce was fantastic with hints of galangal, it was a pity they used lean meat instead of belly

Learnt from the Hong Kong newspaper that this is one of the favorite restaurant of Singapore 1st Prime Minister KY Lee. We tried it out with some local friends when I had a side trip to Singapore back in June. It's a bit noisy with people inside the restaurant, despite the tables are not densely packed. The waiter is not so friendly and not keen to introduce the dishes for our order. Finally, we had Beef Rendang, Bak-W. Kerpting Soup, Ayam B. Keluak, Tkan A Nanas Pedas, Terung Tu Cu, rice and some drinks. Nothing impressed although this is not the first time we tried Pernankan Food. Definintely some other places or even the food court can be better. Especially the beef rendang is very dried. With a relatively high price tag on the menu, it's not a enjoyable meal overall

I was here for dinner on a Saturday night. It has moved to Joo Chiat Place from its previous location along Joo Chiat Road, and there's a large public car park just nearby. It has simple old fashioned decor, rather noisy as it's not carpeted. All the dishes we had other than the Sotong (squid) in sweet sauce were very tasty. These included a large pomfret in a chilli lime sauce, chap chye, sambal kang kong, ayam berluak, ayam coconut curry, pork belly and Chendol. Ngoh hiang was average. The proprietress told us that former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew used to send his security guys to order takeaway every Monday for years. Not surprising given the quality of the food. Bill came to $200 for the 4 of us, which I consider reasonable. Will definitely. return.

As a Peranankan family, we thoroughly enjoyed the fare that was served at Guan Hoe Soon. Most of the dishes were quite genuine and the Buah Keluak is worth a mention. It received a nod of approval from my mum and her siblings - no small feat as they were brought up on my grandma's delicious home- cooked Peranakan cooking.

The three of us walked in at 6 pm on a Friday evening to try this highly recommended restaurant by a trusted Peranakan friend. Left to enjoy the entire restaurant to ourselves, we ordered small plates of Ayam Buah Keluak (S$14), Sayor Lodeh (S$10), Babi Pong Tay (S$10) and White Rice (S$2). Pickle costs S$3. If you want the wet towels, they cost S$0.30 each. Total bill adds up to S$41.75 (including GST, but no service charge). We enjoyed the peace and quiet. The Peranakan food is truly delicious & tasty. We plan to come back again.The address is 38/40 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427762. Tel: 6344-276

I love food. My friends love food. We eat a lot and search for delicious foods. We read about this place being authentic and delicious. We felt we just had to travel all the way there to eat it. We drove from the west of the island all the way to the east just for it. The ambience is casual, abit old style peranakan but looks newly renovated. Service, nothing great. I don't think we should be paying for such service. Minimal to the max. The menu has two sections - peranakan and Chinese. We came all this way for peranakan we totally skipped the Chinese menu section. We ordered the perennial favorites. Beef rendang(beef curry), sayoh lodeh (veggie curry) , babi ponteh (stewed pork), chilli sambal kangkong , sambal grilled fish with rice. Oh I fear to get started on the food... Beef rendang was tender but lukewarm and the gravy... Leaves much to be desired. At $14 for this tiny plate... Totally not worth it. You'll do better with ready made rendang from the supermarket. $4 rendang from Adam road hawker center is 5 times better than this "famous" place. Chilli sambal kangkong was ok, well done, veggies still crisp and good tasting chilli sauce, served piping hot. Grill fish, simply horrible. It was cold, the fish was oily and soggy, the sauce was sweet. We hated it. Strangely the fish was bitter tasting too. Maybe it's not fresh. Curry veggies was ok lah... Not fantastic but not bad either. Babi Ponteh stewed pork just tastes like any braised stew Chinese style pork. Nothing too exciting. Tasty but not worth the price. The horrible terrible small portion size extends to the rice. I don't know it's a mini portion of? I've never before seen such a tiny portion of rice in all my gourmet years. The plate is standard size but the rice is like a mini cup upon the plate. Kid size perhaps, adult size, hardly. Prices are simply too expensive. Just for the 3 of us for a couple of normal lackluster dishes, with only 2 drinks, cost us almost $90!! $30 per pax!? You can have a wonderful Japanese meal in a good restaurant with fantastic desserts. Some may argue- the effort involved in cooking peranakan dishes, the ingredients used, it cannot be compared. But from tasting the food here, I think it was done shoddily and without heart but charged at exorbitant prices. I will not be back and would not recommend this place to anyone despite the good reviews everywhere and makansutra certificate on the wall.
