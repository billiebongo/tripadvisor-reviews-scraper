Great food and great service .
The crispy skin chicken and mixed seafood plate had so much flavour. Recommend both

Strolling by the river side in Singapore on a warm afternoon I noticed this Resturant at the entrance of Clark quay. Thought it is good to have some fish & rice for Lunch. Just for one steamed fish, fried rice and baby kailan the invoice on my table was close to SGD 200....service is very average...it's not really fine dining...very disappointed and felt like fleecing

Had dinner with family (a table for 3) and ordered house specialty - Chilli crab. Sauce was nicely done in perfect combination and service was attentive and prompt. Other food items are also nicely prepared. One of the main positives to draw from this restaurant is its location - plenty of taxies waiting for you AFTER you have finished dinner as it is right next to a taxi stand. For people who visit Singapore often, you would understand getting a taxi at night is NOT easy. Also, close to Fort Canning MRT, which makes this restaurant's location a major attraction!Would go back and recommend
