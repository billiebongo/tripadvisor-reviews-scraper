Went there with me Son to have a men’s lunch and we did enjoy very much. Food was tasty and service very pleasant. Pasta was very well done and sauces a good match. Recommended

It's a Family run Italian restaurant with many dishes with truffles. Owners is very friendly.
Dishes are excellent!

We went to celebrate our anniversary and this place did not disappoint. It’s quiet and intimate on a weekday night just off the bustle of Chinatown.
Food was good all round and the truffle gelato was heavenly.

great little intimate restaurant serving very homely renditions of delicious italian food. Especially love their risotto and truffle gelato
5
Egg noodles with black truffles is delicious! Truffles gelato is surprisingly good. We had fun interacting with the owner's 3 lovely kids too :-)

A very nice restaurant in Singapore.
Just off of a plane this is the first restaurant we went to.
Food was good and service.
It was a bit expensive ,and we had not worked out the local currency.
Meal for two including wine about £125.00

When I made the reservation, I indicated that it was for a special occasion and requested for a quiet corner table. I even called the day before to confirm, although the staff who answered the called wasn't that courteous. To my horror, when we walked into the restaurant, we were led to a dingy corner that was facing the kitchen door and the room was smelling of turpentine. When I enquired on the main dining hall which was empty and nicely decorated, the manager merely said that it was booked by a large group some time time ago . Mine was made at least a month ago. They could at least have called to check with me. I will never go back to the restaurant regardless of how good the food is reputed to be

On my morning stroll when I spotted this lovely looking cafe. Says Italian, watch is around 7am time for a ristretto. Warm nice ambience, nicely greeted by the guy behind the bar. He never heard of a ristretto before, gave him my interpretation of what it is. He gave it a try, using his creative an a automatic machine. Came out excellent!Opening hours on tripadvisor is wrong. They are independent restaurant and service a hotel for breakfast Breakfast here

Ordered a few white truffle dishes and a lobster pasta which were fine. We had to send back the pasta with sea urchin and black truffle as it had a very strong ammonia smell. It was later conveyed to us that the strong ammonia smell was due to unfresh truffle. Very disappointed that a truffle restaurant will serve truffles of such bad quality
5
Cosy down to earth restaurant with very personal and warm service. Had a birthday celebration for a group of 8 and the attentiveness from the staff made it really special. The food was excellent, comparable to any fine dining establishment. White truffle dishes to die for!
5
Excellent food! Every dish was perfectly executed. Loved it, loved it, loved it! We had a wonderful evening there. Will sure to visit soon.
5
Wonderful food and service. The best 'non Asian' food I have eaten in Asia. Finally, a rare steak cooked to order.
5
I had a wonderful dinner at Casa Tartufo. Very friendly staffs. Was celebrating my girlfriend's birthday there and received a nice surprise from them. Truffle Gelato Ice Cream is AMAZING.
5
Love their pan-fried scallops with caviar and their foei gras mini ravioli, both garnished with shaved truffles. I'll be back for more!
3
Not impressed with the truffle dishes. We ordered the much raved about truffle egg noodles but it was just passable. I've had better.
4
It is a small and cosy restaurant that serves very yummy Italian food at a reasonable price tag. The dish Florentina was done perfectly! Though we have requested for the meat to be re-cooked slightly as it was too raw for our liking, the chefs managed to retain it moisture and cooking it to just slightly before well done! We loved the steak!In addition, they have arranged for a complimentary slice of cake with hand-piped "Happy Birthday" on the plate to celebrate the occasion when they got to know that it was our friend's birthday. That was a really kind gesture

A long time favourite. Chef has a way with truffles - the carpaccio is extremely fine, the cream spread incorporates generous slices of truffles and thick shavings of grana padana. Heavenly. I've sampled every home made pasta dish here - this last one featured wide ribbon pasta, with wild mushrooms, porcini mostly and crispy chorizo. Creamy mushroom parm sauce. One can tell that the ingredients are all lovingly sourced and handled. The restaurant was almost empty on a Monday evening, so one would expect a higher level of attention from the servers. In this case, they should have automatically asked me if I wished to have cheese or pepper after serving each dish. A simple matter of training, one supposes. Also, Chef should seriously consider nixing the paper napkins - this is not a picnic meal. This level of food deserves proper white linen serviettes.

What a pleasant surprise to find this little taste of Italy in the Chinatown district of Singapore. We had a drink and bar food on Saturday night and went away highly impressed with the quality of the food and the impressive Italian wine list. I enjoyed a 2012 Brunello which was magnificent and expectational value for such a wine. Impressed with our small tasting from the night before we went back for lunch the next day. We chose the $38 set lunch, an entree of salami and char grilled capsicum salad, so simple yet so many flavours of Italy hit our taste buds. The Tacchino or Milanese style breaded turkey breast was cooked to perfection, the turkey was moist and the crumbing golden brown accompanied with a rocket and tomato salad. The tomatoes are imported fresh from Italy and tasted like real tomatoes should taste and not like the ones you buy at a supermarket. I finished with the signature Truffle gelato which was truly sublime, a hint of truffle immediately hits your palate before a wave of vanilla finishes the experience. Our waiter Mike was so pleasant and extremely helpful. His genuine passion for food and wine shone as bright as his smile. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants an amazing Italian experience in Singapore
4
Their set lunch was extremely affordable at 28++, and had a wide variety of mains and desserts to choose from. Loved the free bread (with balsamic + olive oil dip) and coffee that came with the delicious lunch as well.Extra thumbs up for allowing diners to turn up in shorts and slippers
5
Took my family here for Mother's Day lunch, so opted for their set lunch menu. Menu is great with a wide selection of pasta. Food was yummy and the staff was friendly. Set lunch is of great value to
5
The carpaccio was simply the best I have ever tasted. This was followed by an excellent fish course. The owner/waitress was very attentive. Friendly and atmospheric place!
5
It was a dining occasion that is value for money, had great menu done by Casa Tartufo. Will definitely swing by again
3
Ambience definitely a wow, food was a bit disappointing was expecting more from it. Service was good and accommodating though.
3
It provided breakfast for my stay, but too expensive. The food is ok but nothing more. Service is self service and waiter service.
5
Must order truffle pasta. Beef was slightly disappointing, pork collar was delightful. End off on a sweet note with truffle sorbet.
5
High Quality, healthy ingredients, professional service with in and outsitting possibilites. Thank to Pooja, Alex & Tea
3
Service and environment is quite nice, quiet and tranquil. Starter of the uovo is not too bad, also the scallop fish. Main is way less convincing, in particular my seabass is not properly sourced and doesn't taste fresh. I am pescatarian and have a sharp tongue on fish, and needless to say with the mid to high end pricing I was expecting proper logistics and well sourced fish. I think food is still the most important factor in a restaurant and unlikely will go back here
5
Nice little Italian restaurant that serves up very good Italian cuisines. It was my bff's birthday and the restaurant also gave a complimentary tiramisu :) awesome food. Thanks for the wonderful evening. Service is very good too! Staff very attentive and recommended us a good wine to pair with our dinner. Thanks
3
Service was great, we had 3 dishes, the scramble egg w shaved truffle, tajarin (egg noodles w tartufo), and papardelle w beef ragu. The scrambled eggs was pretty good for the first few mouths but after a while it gets too rich. Same with th tajarin. I also think they didn't put enough salt in the pasta as it was quite bland. Or maybe the truffle is too overpowering. It had a bit of bitter aftertaste. Papardelle was okay.
4
Located at The Scarlet Hotel, most of their dishes have some element of truffles introduction. Even their dessert is uniquely truffle-centric with tiramisu (with a touch of truffle) and truffle gelato, which we were curious and eager to try.There are also main dishes which does not include truffle, in case one is not so inclined to appreciating the aroma and taste of truffle.Their starter of japanese beef carpaccio was very favourful, soft and incredibly tender. Their Burratina (smoked burrata cheese with fresh summer black truffles) was meltingly moist and delectable. Their famous truffle fries were scrumptious.Their appetizing Osso Buco was excellent, and full of melt in the mouth delicate goodness. It was deliciously paired with rich risotto which appeared to have its golden hue from saffron.Their signature thin egg-noodles truffle pasta (Tajarin) had generous shavings of black truffle.The truffle scent and taste was not overwhelming in the tiramisu, but the gelato had a more pronounced truffle flavour.Although we did not try their 3-course set lunch, it is a bargain at $38, which was already the price of most of their mains from their ala-carte lunch menu.The relaxing ambience at this rustic family-run Italian tratorria was rather cosy and quiet. Not crowded for a Friday afternoon, and conducive for a fruitful business lunch.Service was efficient, but could have been friendlier with some welcoming smiles instead.HelenSingapor

chose the restaurant for the food and ambience and it did not disappoint. my party of four enjoyed the venue and food. A little pricey but the food was delicious and overall experience makes it worth paying.
5
Ambience and obliging staff for whom service is no problem - a small oasis of calm in a bustling Singapore - a great place for mid a.m. coffee or late afternoon Prosecco in the heart of Chinatown ! Perfect .
5
The restaurant offers a usual dining area downstairs which is like a good Italian restaurant, but we usually like to go on the romantic roof terrace - it's cosy, not always quite, but a good escape in the city.The service is average on the terrace, as it's not easy to oversee all tables, but the waiters are good. You juts have to call them, or wait - depends on your patience! :)The food is delicious. They really have the biggest choice on the menu with truffles.Everything is good! Enjoy, but carefully check when they are open
4
Really good set lunch menu. Portions are good and value for money. Need to wait a while for the food so have at least an hour
3
If you like truffles, this is the place to go. We like how they infuse truffles in their starters, mains and desserts. The cheese with crispy Parma ham drizzled with honey truffle is really yummy. Have to add that there is an excellent selection of Italian wines too. Service is good, ambience cozy and romantic, however prices are on the higher range, recommended for special occasions when you want to splurge on loved ones
5
We ordered their house specialty Tarjarin, their signature thin egg noodles with fresh black truffles sourced from Tuscany, as well as their veal shank. The veal shank was savoury and tender with tasteful bits of tendon. There was bone marrow which added a rich flavor to the saffron risotto which accompanied this dish. Their house pour red, a Tuscan IGT by Massi, paired well with the veal shank. The slightly acidic Tuscan red complimented the tender veal tendon. The standout dish was the Tarjarin pasta, a Piedmont dish which is their house specialty and on their menu for over 6 years. Rich in flavor from the black truffles sourced from Tuscany, the pasta itself was simply al detente and provided a deliciously springy bite. The rich mushrooms sauce is well immersed in the egg noodles. While on a trip to Italy we had many excellent pastas and this dish certainly ranks with the best of them. For travelers to Italy, Casa Tarttufo's signature pasta dish will transport them back to the warm memories of their Italian summer. This dish pairs well with their second house wine, a Veneto. The ambience of the restaurant is also very European. Cozy, warm and romantic like as if one was back in Italy.
5
Love the dishes over at this homely restaurant. Makes me feel like Im back in the quint part of Italy. High recommended if you are looking to bring your date or loved ones for a good time.Do order their truffle dishes. It was REALLY GOOD. Highlight of my meal was the

We had a lazy Sunday lunch as there was a craving for truffles. Surprisingly child friendly as there is a playroom off to the side that can be opened up for the kids. The Bolognese was declared the best ever by the 6 year old, and the adults enjoyed their signature Tajarin, egg noodles served with lashings of truffles. They do a set lunch 7 days a week, and with the service being attentive and warm, we will be back
4
Went as a group to celebrate the birthdays of 2 friends. We tried a variety of food - burratina, tajarin, capellini (with sicilian red prawns), lombata, maiale (iberico pork), truffle sorbet. You could say we were "truffle-ised"! Food was great except for the tiramisu which was a little disappointing. Staff were attentive and polite.We even liked the cookies which came with our coffee/tea. Alex, the owner, made sure we were each given a pack of cookies to bring home. Truly a memorable evening
4
My first visit to Casa Tartufo, invited by friends who have been there before. Food: Delicate taste of very fine yet robust taste of Sicilian cuisine. Had the Egg Noodle with Truffle (sorry can't remember the actual name) and the Capellini with Sicilian Prawns! Absolutely divine to my gastronomic tastebuds. All of us (7 ladies) never thought we could finish 2 humongous portions of meat. The T-bone Steak and Pork Ibericca Collar Bone. But we finished every morsel. It was the first time my chewing machine didn't have to work overtime. It was a beautiful smooth taste. Desserts were good too.....but will leave you to discover.Service: We all wanted to try both pasta. Brilliant idea by the Host. She got us to order 3 portions of one and 4 portions of the other. Our servings came beautifully plated with both pastas. That was truly a treat from the Host and Chef.Thank you Casa Tartufo team for an unforgettable dining experience!
5
I went on Aug 9, for Lunch. The Service was excellent, they are very attentive and they really know what they are serving. Overall this is a place that I highly recommend for those Truffle Lovers.
5
Perfect food & ambience. Waiters are very friendly and helpful! Plenty of good food and wine choices. Would recommend to any couple looking for a romantic dinner.
4
Authentic italian food with a zeste of cook originality . Nice service , nice place . Decent price . Adress not ot forget in the area .
On top they do cooking teaching for small groups .
4
Greater welcome - family welcome atmosphere great menu try the private dunning they have a very decent wine list - la masa always a good choice
5
Have been going to Casa Tartufo way before they moved to this current location. What made the difference is the high level of service and the friendliness. Our family thoroughly enjoy our every visit. The food has been great. Would keep on visiting

HI, the food was average, but service was great and the decor as nice.. but since food was average, i will most likely not make a trip back

Casa Tartufo is the breakfast / dining room of the Scarlet Hotel where we have been staying. Breakfast is a fairly standard motel-type buffet breakfast with a few Singaporean twists.We dined tonight. I did not enquire about "gluten-free", having been informed at breakfast that all the bread was gluten free because it was wholemeal! My porcini mushrooms arrived, fried in a light batter. When I enquired, the Lady of the house, who had a good understanding of English and culinary terms immediately offered me an alternative of fresh girolle mushrooms in a white wine sauce, gluten free and delicious. I had never thought to be eating fresh girolles. My wife finished off the porcini. Next came my beef Carpaccio, and Karen had fresh Mediterranean sardines. All delicious. We had no room for anything more
5
The menu offered a wide selection of dishes, including several ones containing truffles. It was a tough choice before I could make the decision to go ahead with the Japanese beef carpaccio with generous servings of fresh truffle shavings and truffle paste.It was very much enjoyed and portion was just nice. The foie gras filled ravioli was on the other hand, on the creamy and heaver side, though I would say the wine managed to balance that out. Taste-wise, it was delicious, and the main course was truly a full-filling ne!Service was friendly and swift. Love the decor of the restaurant/hotel too
2
I tried Happy Hour but with limited options it was a Fail. Never had skunky prosecco before...even cheap prosecco is usually no worse that "ok". The house white was as good as low quality jug wine from Lodi. The music was not only too loud, but sounded like some washed up Italian crooner with strep throat being tortured. I couldn't take it. I bailed out before attempting to order food
3
Went there with my colleague for the set lunch while I am staying in the Scarlet Hotel. The style of this venue is a little bit rustic but the food was decent. However I think the good might be overpriced compared to other restaurants in the CBD of Singapor
4
Main two dishes (pasta) were good, but slighty oversalted. Truffle icecream is a must and is worth a visit!
4
Next to the Scarlet Hotel, you will find Casa Tartuffo. Truffel (Tartuffo) is in a lot of their dishes. Few tables for 2 outside : not a stunning view but nice to be in a non air-con environment sometimes. Professional service, nice menu, good dishes, nice wine list....prices might be a bit on the high side. On the top floor, you have a very nice bar - open terrace. Don't miss it after dinner
5
I used to patronise Casa Tartufo when it was located in Forum, then I forgotten all about it after it moved to The Scarlett Hotel. It took the Restaurant Week dining event in March to remind me of Casa Tartufo, and I had a wonderful three-course lunch there.I enjoyed an appetising beetroot soup with yoghurt and a splash of truffle oil; an unattractive brown mash of mushroom ravioli with porcini cream and truffle oil that tasted way better than it looked; a flavourful twisted pasta with pesto sauce, roasted almonds and Sicilian prawns; and the restaurant's signature truffle ice-cream and a sprinkle of sea salt. On top of the Restaurant Week set menu, we also threw in an order of beef carpaccio with rocket and a heap of truffle shavings. Great decision. The beef was shaved perfectly thin and was so fresh.Attentive and friendly service by Adrian was cherry on top, and the entire dining experience made me book an eight-pax lunch the following weekend to celebrate my birthday.In terms of environment, Casa Tartufo can be quite the versatile venue. In the day, it is bright and serene, perfect for family get-togethers. In the evening, the restaurant takes on a sexy vibe and is great for romantic dinners or celebratory dinners for small groups
5
I'm a great fan of finding hidden gems for food while travelling, especially on business travel when one can end the hectic work day with a menu to look forward to, reliable service and a foodie chat with Chef. I've used this restaurant in all my frequent visits to Singapore since opening, when Chef and I chatted about homemade pasta and truffles, a heady combination. I'm glad to say that the quality of the food is consistently high, the truffles a rare treat, the presentation charming - without being the usual Gordon Ramsey-type anemic and over-done fussy decoration of a too-large plate. My Italian grandmum always served proper portions and thankfully so does Casa. A wonderful change of pace from the lame Italian restaurants we suffer from in HK, where the chef is overrated and the portions mingey (sp?), and the pricing ridiculously high. At Casa, I sampled the rigatoni, the cappellaci, and the accompanying appetisers - one of which featured an antipasto with beautifully done grilled zucchini and cherry tomatoes, fresh leaves, pesto and hints of truffle. The bruschetta likewise had a lovely portion of bufalino mozzarella, all appreciated. Excellent for a business lunch, or better yet, enjoy on one's own to fully enjoy the flavours without the distraction of having yack away at business stuff. Lastly, and rare for Singapore, the service is attentive without being overly intrusive, AND they remember your preferences, a rarity. Enjoy . .

Specialized in truffle with an original twist, all the ingredients are extremely fresh!I tried the truffle burrata and it was sublime (I'm italian and I come from the region where they produce burrata, you can trust my burrata palate!), the egg noodle with truffle excellent and the veal as well was cooked at perfection. They have a very good wine selection, the owner from Sicily is kind and welcoming but not invasive, he also offered us coffee at the end of the dinner. Definitely a great place for a romantic dinner, the place is quit with soft jazz music and italian classics, perfect to talk. There is an amazing rooftop bar called Aria that deserves a look at the end of the dinner. Looking forward to go there again soo

Walk In. Dinner for 2Wanted to satisfy some truffle cravings and decided to check this place out. Specializing in truffles.......what can go wrong.The restaurant itself is nice, it reminded me of some places I visited in Italy. Cosy and quaint but not tacky. The service was a let down. It was funny because initially we didn't even know who the waiter was, it was only later when we realized that the guy in jeans and t shirt was part of the staff. Eventually we noticed he put on an apron, probably under the guidance of the manager. Overall the service felt confused and uninviting. The food was good overall. Several high notes but dragged down by a couple of disappointments. The cocktails were decent but the bread was average at best. The Tomino was good and the Tartufata was excellent. The Tajarin tasted good but the texture of the pasta was a disappointment. The Risotto was the biggest disappointment....it was suppose to have sea urchin but honestly there really wasn't much in the dish and the overall taste of the dish was average at best. Perhaps it was the quality and quantity of the sea urchin for the day, but it was a far cry from my early experiences with this dish elsewhere. Overall. For the price your paying you would expect better quality. I would also recommend the restaurant ditch the electronic imitation table candles.....or buy better ones, the current ones flicker like Christmas tree lights and do injustice to the rest of the interior.

Dinner was excellent! The owner is very friendly. He made the lemon tart dessert using lemons that had been brought from Sicily

It was a good friend's birthday celebration and we chanced upon this place earlier in the morning en route to breakfast. We had 2 special bottles of wine with us and wanted someplace nice to enjoy it with dinner. Singapore corkages are nowadays rather high so we booked in advanced and spoke to a lady manager who initially offered a 1 to 1 free corkage but we negotiated bring 2 to pay1 as it was really a special birthday. In the end with all the grappas and averna after the meal, corkage was waived.Food reminds us really of good italian places, proper service, good ambiance, unobtrusive yet efficient staff despite a full house. We ordered of frito miso, tomino, tajarin, gnocchi to share and for mains, the beef and the pork. Highlight was the beef and gnocchi while all the rest was great. Special mention to the truffle fries as well.For dessert birthday boy had a special plate of lemon sorbet and semifreddo which chef whipped up and we all sampled. It was a leisurely meal filled with laughter, wines, good food and thoroughly enjoyable. While by no means cheap at 500 Sin for 4 person, it beats flying 13 hours to Italy and still paying about the same price for the same good value.I hear in the upstairs bar there is a sicilian casual dining place which will be high on my list to try next time.Go if you like truffles and good italian
5
Had a couple of dinners here recently. A business dinner and another one with family. The ambience is cosy and classy. The service is thoughtful and considered. The menu is varied, with lots of wonderful options. The dishes with truffles really stand out. We had the 4 course set dinner menu. It was delicious. Burratta, followed by truffle pasta, then salmon, ending with a lovely truffle ice cream. Great value, and delicious. Highly recommend it
5
A wonderful charming modern Italian flair restaurant with authentic prepared dishes, music, desserts, wines and ambience. I was taken by the nice music reminding me of my days in Italy with family. A great charming place for lunch or dinner coupled with an amazing roof top bar and terrace that can receive small corporate parties and great for a trendy wedding reception. Have a look. It's really nice....but go at night on the roof as it's quite sunny during the day
4
The menu is varied but not extensive. Quality of the food is good and the service friendly and efficient. Convenient if staying in the Scarlet Hotel.

Good, Good ,Good,

My first choice for every visit to singapore .
See you soon

Casa Tartufo is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. My husband and I frequent this restaurant when we used to live in Singapore and I always go there for dinner when I visit Singapore.
All-time favourites are tomino, tajarin (the best!) and costata.
4
We visited this Italian restaurant twice while staying at the Scarlet Hotel. It was fairly quiet at lunchtime (although we were there for an early lunch after arriving into Changi Airport a short while earlier) but got busy during the evening. There was a good, laid-back atmosphere, staff were friendly and helpful, food good and prices reasonable. The truffle chips were very tasty and, even if you want nothing else, it's worth visiting for these alone
5
We popped in for a drink only. Thebar staff were lovely and some other guests were straight into having a banter with us.They were lovely, easy going guys. Within minutes they insisted we join them in that restaurant and have dinner with them and their group. So, we had done no research on Casa Atartufo, at all. But they ate there regularly and rated it as best Italian in Singapore, (something I have missed, to be honest). They introduced us to Alex the chef and owner. Another very charming man.Alex just brought out freshly made food until we cried stop!! I didn't see a menu or choose one item. That was great as I would never have had Spaghetti Carbonara as most places make it far too rich for me. This was beautiful. Just enough sauce to cover each strand of freshly made pasta. Yet another reminder of how ignorance interferes with great experiences.I can't recall how much red wine Alex poured into my wine, nor the name unfortunately, but it was gorgeous! We had so many courses I can't remember them all.This was also because I was lucky enough to sit next to the gorgeous and vivacious ladies in the group, I was enjoying the company as much as the food. But I do recall that the fiorentina steak was simply awesome too!So, I will definitely be coming back and heartily recommend it to you too
5
We had been in Singapore for almost a week and had experienced a range of food but wanted something special to end on. So, we emailed a friend who recommended Casa Tartufo, which we would not have found on the web. It was spectacular! The best Italian outside Italy and New York. We had the truffle pasta for starters and the lamb and cod for mains, with Tiramisu and truffle ice cream for desert. Unpretentious, not cheap but by far the best meal we've had in Singapore and we wouldn't have found it on Tripadvisor
5
This little place is just wonderful. The staff is so sweet and kind and I felt they really care for me. Just had some coffee, formaggi and prosciutto, but even so just spending time in the bar is great. Italian music comes out the speakers and the whole atmosphere just calls for another espresso.
4
I visited here with my family for Christmas Eve dinner. They only has the festive set menu for this meal, so I haven't tried the standard menu. The festive menu was delicious, really tasty food, good service and a great atmosphere, would recommend and will be back
4
The food - from the antipasti to the mains - of the set lunch was good. The rigatoni was lacklustre, though.
5
Casa Tarufuro is an intimate Italian restaurant specializing in truffle dishes. This is the way that dinner should be. Something good, memorable and of high quality. It is not an overly ambitious restaurant with presentations that you can’t figure out what you are eating or where to start. It is honest and authentic intimate restaurant of 20 or so tables. There are also more tables outside for dining street side and some good people watching. There’s also a chefs kitchen good for cooking demonstrations or small interactive get-togethers. This is not a flashy restaurant or the place to see and be seen and celebrity sightings, there are plenty of those in Singapore. This is about really great food, fresh, delicious and without a lot of fuss.This is a family run establishment and the Chef and his wife are the owners and business manages. Chef Alex was born in Marsala, Italy where he found hiss a love of the truffle and good old fashion Italian cooking. They also manage the restaurant and lounge Aria upstairs with views of the downtown Singapore. It is a fabulous alfresco space for dining on Italian small plates, having a drink or sharing time with friends
3
Everything here is about truffle. They even have truffle ice cream! I ordered the truffle pasta (homemade pasta) and truffle fries. Sadly, they ran out of truffle ice cream.
5
Great staff and good food. I only had breakfast there for 3 days but judging by the breakfast, I would expect lunch and dinner to be equally good. Friendly and accommodating staff!
4
Upon recommendation of a friend, we stopped by for Sunday lunch. I tried the set lunch for the day. I ordered the Tajarin (signature thin egg noodles with summer truffles) and went for the truffles ice cream. Both were very good. We will be back again for a more comprehensive sampling of the menu
5
As the restaurant'so name suggests, this is for all truffle lovers. Everything from starters to dessert is infused with the heavenly scent and taste of these prized fungi. The pasta with truffles is a must-have, to die for! The burrata is a huge portion, and contains truffle-infused cream
4
My wife and I had breakfast here while staying in the Scarlet hotel. The restaraunt was a nice place to start the day , breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of western food and a couple of Asian dishes , they also know how to make an Espresso coffee which is a win for me .
5
Lovely restaurant with a very homey feel. The staff is extra attentive and had great suggestions for our meal. The fresh pasta was fantastic and they have an amazing range of desserts... try the tiramisu (or 2, as I did!) -- one of the best I've tried. They have a very relaxing roof bar as well where, I was pleasantly surprised, they grew herbs to put in their recipes. Would definitely go back
5
Most wonderful evening, excellent food with great ambience and attentive service . Highly recommended for a casual and romantic evening or even business entertainment over dinner. Enjoyed the Sauvignon Blanc and Valpolicella with our meal. We were kind of stuffed before dinner and looking for something light. Ordered the black cod and the truffle pasta (forgot the name) and both were excellent ! We polished off every bit of it. Dessert was also excellent - the tiramisu and the truffle gelato which was well worth the calories !
4
lovely food served by lovelier people. What a nice lunch date this was, feels like being in Sicily. The white truffles are yummy. Must try for Iovers of Italian
3
This restaurant was attached to our hotel so we came here for breakfast as my husband didn't fancy noodles for breakfast from the market across the street. There was a good choice of hot food and the coffee was very nice. The service was very attentive
3
We had breakfast here as we missed the breakfast time at the hotel. We order the fritatta - there was nothing Italian about it: it was a Spanish tortilla. That said, it was very tasty and the service was absolutely polite and kind
5
We enjoyed breakfast at Café Tartufo for a week as part of our Scarlet Hotel Package and could not have asked for more.
4
Nice little a Italian tratoria. Food was very good the service proficient. I have nothing more to say
5
This charming restaurant is the work of a young Italian chef and his family. It is like eating in his cozy home and the food is wonderful!!
5
I'm a frequent visitor at Casa tartufo, and have never been disappointed, whether it is restaurant week or a normal evening, service and food quality are both always top notch! Family friendly, romantic, run by a wonderful couple, one of my favourite places to be!
3
It is nothing spectacular. Will not go back. Expensive for what it is.
The location is great, and the hotel that houses it is fabulous. But not the restaurant
5
This is my second time to Casa Tartufo over two visits to Singapore in a year. Suffering from jet-lag last year, I was not sure if it is as good as I remember. This year just reconfirmed my recollection of a great meal. Highly recommended.Plin - ravioli filled with beef cheeks! Perfectly cooked pasta.How can something as simple as French fries with truffles be so good
2
The kitchen had no idea what poached eggs were, what came out I wouldn't have fed to my cats. The night before I went in for a drink and found the manager so unfriendly with a couldn't care less attitude, only interested in Italian guests. It's unfortunate as it serves as the Scarlet Hotel's bar & breakfast area. The Scarlet itself is great
2
As a foodie who likes to splurge occasionally, my view is that if a restaurant is going to dress itself up as high-end, it should provide well-considered and well-prepared fare, and particularly so if it's a bit pricey. So I was quite disappointed with my recent visit to Casa Tartufo in Singapore.I had a beetroot-centered salad as a starter. Clearly, the beets were from a tin can -- not such a sin if fresh beets are not available -- but there were so many diced beet chunks that it was hard to discern any other flavors. Half a can? Three quarters? It was "beet chunks + a tiny bit of green stuff." And, "Oh right, here are some pine nuts."The biggest sin of all, though -- and probably something that I will burn in Hell for ordering -- was the veal scaloppine. I'm a conscience-stricken veal-a-fore. If I'm going to chomp on the delicious meat of a cute little calf with few social skills, the veal should be beautifully and gratefully cooked.Unfortunately, the veal scaloppine at Casa Tartufo was overcooked -- grey on the inside -- and as chewy as a piece of Wrigley's. Seriously, guys.It was clear that the proprietors valued their wine selection: I watched as they restocked their dining room shelves with wines that soared into the SGD thousands. Hmm, perhaps that's where their profit margins lie?But if you want home-cooked Italian fare, steer clear

Food was excellent! The waiters initially had our orders wrong - they included cheese when we asked for none but this was rectified once they were notified of the error. On a side note, perhaps have real candles instead of faux ones for a romantic ambience

Loved the intimate and chic ambience. Good service overall (perhaps they should just smile a bit) Extremely friendly owner will wlelcome you.Portions of the starters are rather small, we left a bit hungry..Truffle dessert was awesomeprices are not low especially if you add the wine but than again Hey it's truffle!will go bac

Everytime i come here, this place never fails in their food quality and excellent service. Would recommend this place for special occasions or when you feel like you want to splurge a bit on quality food its the place to go.

Attentive staff. Using truffles a lot. All pastas and tomato gravies oh so good - have to return different ones next time.

This is a friendly, fresh food, good quality restaurant... worth a visit if you're in the area...
I had breakfast - very very good!

This place is near my dental clinic and we always visit here after for some snack. It was in the afternoon and not all menu is available. overall the food was nice.

I have been first with my wife, for my birthday and truffle burrata to share was more than enough and so tasty. Then we had taken Tajarin pasta platter, it means fresh pasta with eggs and black truffles just arrived from Italy.Must say and must taste, as it was really close to perfection !Than I have been with colleagues and the same, outside this time we enjoyed our risotto with truffles and sea urchin, and my gnocchi with Gorgonzola and just a taste of black truffles were so great.Barolo 2009 was also excellent.Well to me, this is the really good place to go in Singapore at the moment. Truffle season has started in Italy and it might explain why all choices are so tasty in Casa Tartuffo

This restaurant is located in the Scarlet hotel. The food is good, but not great and most definitely overpriced. The menu scares you with 180S$ steaks and 60+ egg dishes that drown in Truffles. We had a bill of nearly 500S$ for three and I can not remember a dish I liked. The attentive service personnel recommends only the most expensive dishes and the wine knowledge seems to be a bit patchy.To sum it up, food is ok, but prices are not. Will not come back

The service was really bad, even though there wasn't a lot of people around.They gave us such a small table for 3 people, saying that they are full, even though we were given a confirmation for our reservation. At the end of the meal, we requested for the waitress to break a $50 note for us, and her illogical reply was that they do not have small change!! - So if we pay by cash, are we supposed to give exact change?? They do not even have a dessert menu, and the waitress just stood there to rattle off some of the dessert they have.Food is extremely overpriced, and the promise of the truffle taste do not exist. We had the mushroom soup with black truffle - yeah, 1 pathetic slice. Their signature truffle fries tasted worse than MacDonald's french fries - at least MacDonald's fries were crispy, ours were soggy and no truffle taste whatsoever. Pasta was also a let down - clearly not handmade, but ready boiled.A very unpleasant gastronomical evening

If you like truffles, there are truffles !However gnocchi were at acceptable Italian standard, the ravioli ricotta and spinach were low grade: given the prices the quality swing is too high.The bar is poorly managed, with staff often sitting smoking on outside tables and discouraging customers to sit there; cappuccino and expresso are simply not good.It was far better when the restaurant was directly managed by the Scarlet hotel

Came across this restaurant by chance when it was still located at Forum Galleria a few years ago. My foody girlfriend was in Italy and was raving about the yummy truffle pasta she had there. So we decided to give it a try. We went for the set lunch with the truffle pasta as the main course and it was simply mouth wateringly delicious. The desserts were good too, especially the truffle ice cream, lemon torte and truffle tiramisu. After our first meal there. We have been returning to it whenever we have a craving for truffle pasta. It has now moved to 33 Erskine Road and its still as cosy the ambience with friendly staff

The menu is quite a short list of classic dishes. Of course what distinguishes Casa Tartufo is the use of truffle as an ingredient. It is not in every dish but the serving of white truffle on my pasta was quite generous and delicious.There is a short but well selected list of Italian wines. The Dolceto I drank was lovely.My only gripe is with the pace of the meal. It was served very quickly with little or no gap between courses. This is a common problem in Singapore and the owner was not present on the night that I dined. I expect that normally the pacing of the meal is better

Average service and food.all Good but nothing exceptional.pasta everage....service to be reviewed...

The new location is really great and the food is still as good as it used to be. This is one of the rare place where true Italian food is served in Singapore. In addition, the Chef is so dedicated to serving great truffle and produce
5
The restaurant closed for a little while and re-opened at its new address on Erskine Road. The ambience at the new restaurant is much better than at the old restaurant - much homier. Outside dining is now available - if you like that sort of thing in hot and humid SingaporeSame good food and same warm, attentative service. One or 2 new items on the menu but all of our old favourites were there cooked to the same high standards. Welcome back

If you were to walk pass by Casa, its Very unassuming from the outside. And that's if one happened to be walking into the Forum shopping complex which is off the orchard main road but quite a quiet joint i would say. Nothing arty fartsy screaming to be heard. But the deco exudes a warm cosy feel , inviting you in, greeted by the warm welcoming owner. And thats where the food adventure begins ! Oh lovely lovely. Its the winter season in italy, and the menu is filled with dishes using winter black truffles as ingredients.With a party of 3, we ordered a few selections to share amongst - starters of the tartufata mushroom soup, the burrata cheese, the porcini salad, the main meal of the pumpkin tortelli, the simple handmade egg noodles tarjarin and roasted Atlantic black cod merluzzo, and to end with the tiramisu. All I can say, we were transported to a different place with all these food. We weren't in Singapore ! Ah heaven ! I would go back again to try the next season's menu

We dined here after searching for a place to serve simple food with white truffles and were extremely pleasantly surprised how good it was! Whilst we are not fans of dining in shopping malls but once inside, you can quickly forget where you are. We were too ambitious with our ordering - with the burrata and scrambled eggs with white truffles, followed by risotto and egg noodles both with white truffles. The burrata was creamy and the best we have had in Singapore and even Italy - it was a generous serve and we didn't want to waste food so we polished off the whole thing! The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked to let the white truffles shine - easily the best scrambled eggs we have eaten anywhere in the world - perfectly seasoned with the right texture. Risotto was again perfectly cooked - each grain had just enough bite and the flavour also perfect. The pasta was also very good but the other dishes were perfection by comparison. We were just too full for dessert.The restaurant was not flashy or Ã¼ber fancy, it was comfortable and homely but delivered amazingly well prepared food. The service was also very good - the trainee was better than most trained staff in Singapore and the Italian gentleman, assume that is the owner, was great with his recommendations.We will definitely be back for more white truffles and would also be keen to try their other dishes based on the quality of the dishes that we had this time. Highly recommended

Although it has been around for 3 years, last weekend was the first time we tried the restaurant. For all lovers of truffles, it would be fantastic. Everything from the soup, to the pasta, to the gelato, was flavoured by truffles. The quality of the food was good and the service was excellent. From the point we entered to the point we left, the Italian gentleman fronting the restaurant was attentive but not intrusive. Would certainly recommend it for a glimpse of Italy

We stayed in Singapore last week and were recommended to this restaurant by a concierge. We would never have known it was there, as it is hidden away in an unlikely shopping mall, called The Forum (adjacent to the Hilton and Four Seasons Hotels. It looked and felt very authentic though, and the owner was just lovely - a Sicilian background, with grandparents from the north - and the food was outstanding. There was of course, as the name suggests, an emphasis on truffles and it was really fantastic. Just like being in Umbria in the Autumn!I was able to practice my Italian and we had a great evening. Would highly recommend this if you like real Italian trattorias - and truffles

I had always passed by this restaurant but never dined there until recently. I was intrigued by the place which had the feel of an elegant italian home with dark furniture, chandeliers & marble flooring. The truth is that this charming restaurant is situated in a busy Orchard Road mall!Deciding that it was time to test the waters, I visited for a leisurely lunch on my day off. If you appreciate the pungent earthiness of truffles, then you'd come to the right place. Alex, the owner runs the place along with his wife Tammy & could not be more hospitable. He took time to explain the set menu as well as the a la carte. I opted for the latter & began with a disc of warm tomino cheese, unctuous & oozing goodness, wrapped in parma ham & drizzled with truffle honey. An excellent choice, paving the way for what was to follow. My pasta dish was the much lauded, Tajarin or thin Piedmontese egg noodles in a sage & butter sauce, finished off with shavings of black summer truffles. I really felt like I had gone to heaven as it was that good!! After that, it was the simplicity of a couple of scoops of gelato - one truffle flavoured & the other hazelnut, nestled in a bed of crumble. I could not be happier & plan on returning very soon

Dined here with a friend for a casual & relax evening - we were here on Thursday - the usual day when fresh ingredients from italy arrived! I loved everything we ordered from appetizer to main to dessert to wine - all are fantastic! The service is warm and cosy. We will definitely return for the good food & friendly service - a place you can feel at home
5
We have been coming off and on to this restaurant for over 2 years so can vouch for the consistency of the food. Have had a range of the menu and truly, Alex takes the trouble to bring out flavours. Not everything has truffles (but the tiramisu does!!) and whether with or sans, there is a lot of effort put into each dish and one can taste the difference. Have had family dinners and corporate dinners and always enjoyed excellent service fm both Alex & his wife, as well as their staff.Even the tiramisu (which has the surprise tinge of truffles) is made fresh and the rich flavour of mascarpone is immediately obvious. I point this dessert out in particular because many restaurants often serve a tiramisu that's been sitting in the fridge for days and the flavour is very dull

I was very satisfied, good service, good food, and very nice owners who make you feel at home.
I will come back for sure next time,

We had been patronising Casa Tartufo since the memorable time when my husband proposed to me here. Food is nothing short of immaculate. Clean and rich flavours. Alex and Tammy are also friendly and generous in recommending their freshest produce and narrate their latest addition to their menu. Come here with loved ones and enjoy the experience of dining. Simply belissimo

Food was good - angel hair pasta with Tuna Bottarga was really nice and strong. Service was efficient and friendly. But I do wished that one of the staff would calm down instead of being hurried and late for something. Loved the small diner feel. However, the night I was there, there was a family with a toddler that was bored and hence created a ruckus. I don't blame the child, but the parents who left it to the helper/nanny to deal with the child. Didn't appreciate the child screaming when we wanted to eat in quiet. For that, i would have rated this place as excellent. Instead it was just average

We visited at the end of a rainy day as we were stuck in the Forum with tired hungry baby and always been curious about the restauran. We were the only ones in the restaurant although we were early and a large group were just coming in as we left. Prosecco was flat, possibly left over from the previous day. I had rigatoni bolognaise, whihc was very good and my wife had veal, which she said was very good too. We split a tiramisu for dessert and that was fairly average. They made an effort with the baby who was a bit tired. Brought out little plastic plate and bowl for him.Overall, it might be worth trying again for a lunch set, but for the money we paid, not sure about dinner again

My wife and I have never dined at Casa Tartufo Ristorante so we were both looking forward to trying out dinner here during Singapore Restaurant Week. The ambiance is lovely - a quaint & cozy restaurant that makes you feel like you're dining in a nice littel cafe in Florence or Milan. The hostess was very accomodating and seated us in a quiet area near the wine cellar. The wait staff were very attentive and knew the menu well. The food was amazing and authentic italian; from the burrata injected with truffles and herbs, to the perfectly seared fish with tomatoes, to the truffle pasta, and finally to the simple, yet delicious gelato with chocolates and nuts. Overall, it was one of the best places we dined at during Restaurant week and definitely a "must-visit" if you love italian food. We will definitely be back again

It's hard to get burrata in Singapore and this place imports it (Tue and Thur/fri - they told us). So that's a real treat. Had the carbonara with truffle cream - was a little too heavy on the cream although the truffle taste to the carbonara was great. I'm not big on cream so that's a personal taste thing. I had their steak with truffled butter... was excellent. Also they seem to have an excellent wine selection...the SERVICE is EXCELLENT. Attentive, friendly and not overwhelming still. I'd go back whenever a truffle craving strikes again
5
Cosy restaurant in a shopping mall. Excellent food with an emphasis on using truffles in the recipes - even in the desserts. Black truffles always available. White truffles whist in season. Whilst there was no hint of truffles in the veal chop cooked Milanese style, the fries did. Very good service. Extensive wine list and the sommelier knew his stuff
5
The place looks more like a shop tucked away in the Forum Mall but the charming hostess convinced me her Italian husband had a great restaraunt so I took advantage of the excellent value set lunch at only $$38:- Deep fried Sardines - perfection! Beef Ragu Rigatone-wow! I lived in the Mediteranean for seven years and I have visited 70 countries-never in my life have I tasted Ragu sauce as good as this. Aldrin, the Filipino waiter was very attentative,ensuring my thirst for water was repeatedly quenched without asking.If you want to taste every ingredient in the recipe, this is as authentic as you will get in Singapore!Already booked a table for dinner

We went here for a business meal and I have to say that I was a little sceptical; you don't expect to get good Italian food in Singapore! However the staff were so welcoming that we felt very comfortable there; they left us alone to talk and were discreetly helpful when necessary. The menu was a list of delights so choosing was hard and truffles featured strongly; I had some delicious fish for my main and it was delicious. We had mushrooms with truffle oil for starters and other anti pasti- all yummy. I have not tasted Italian so good outside Italy. Definitely recommended
