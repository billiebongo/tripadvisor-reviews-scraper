Nice break, nice coffee in the typical SIN tradition! If you have time and you need to taste how coffee was in SIN before the arrival of the various coffee chain, pop in- it is interesting!

Only few selection of food, simple yet all worth it. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I really love the coffee and dessert small slice of cake was good not too sweet. I surely back here again to try their other food.

Love their expanding menu with lots of variety for food and drinks. Enjoyed the noodles with fried chicken cutlet and ice coffee. Toastbox is everywhere, surely should visit one again!

Toastbox has good selection of food items not just coffee and toast. That's why it's always long queue no matter where and when!

Still a nice place to go to for toast and tea, ut I do not really like the multi grain bread version. This place is also getting to be very popular with tourists.I still wish they could put in place proper signage to indicate where you line up to order for takeaways, and where to queue to dine in, having seen several times when customers end up at the wrong line initially

We stayed at The Quincy and were daily visitors to the Toastbox on Mt Elizabeth (behind the Paragon).Fantastic service and the coffee was just perfect. And I'm going to have to buy extra baggage allowance for the peanut butter...Weirdly though they don't sell the branded white mugs as merchandise, which I found strange. If starbies are doing this and making a go of it I could imagine the same being true here

Stopped here for a late breakfast early lunch, had fried chicken and rice which came with a chilli sauce and some spicy pickled cucumber (definitely not something I'd eat in Oz for brekky) was good, I was pleasantly surprised Didn't like the iced tea though it was too sweet and sugary. Place is very busy but they turn the food and drinks out very quickly

I absolutely love this place. They have a great asian pastry selection. For me, the "come back for more" pastries were the ones have a lava center which, when warm, is similiar to a soft center surprise of egg tart type filling. Delicious!!! Famously serves Nanyang Coffee which tips the hat to coffee served since the 1940's where attention and tradition of roasting and grinding preparation creates the delicious kopi

We visited Toastbox almost every morning. It has a great atmosphere, Staff were good and friendly. and somehow i like the taste of their Kaya toast that anywhere!
one should visit and try the kaya toast menu! :)

As a coffee addict, my visits to toast box is inevitable. The ambience of the shop, taste of coffee, banana cakes and pastries misses a lot now.

Fresh toast - many variety - fast service - they prepare the food in frond of you - no jokes no triks

If in a hurry, you want a beverage warm or cold a set of snacks to go with the beverage, it is a quick stop and you can be refreshed for your next challenge. No long wait.

As I understand, this cafe is a chain restaurant and I went to the Toastbox in MBS.
They were very efficient, and both the Kaya Toast and the Curry Laksa was delicious.

The egg tarts here are very special. Not available in every outlet. Always buy them at Toastbox Wisma Atria. Don't miss them if you are here!

Their branches all have the same menu. Quality of food is good. Each prepared only when ordered. Coffee, tea, toast with different varieties, local food like Mee siam and curry noddles add to your choices. They also sell cakes - the kind with different flavour cream on it. Good place for a quick snack, or filler. Good to have a cupcake with friends though they might need the place so nit ideal for chatting for too Long. Prices comparable to most other outlets selling the same stuff

Love to eat breakfast at toastbox every morning. Addicted to the tea with milk and floss nutri grain bread plus two soft boiled eggs. They also serve laksa, Mee rebus and the traditional kaya and butter with sugar set. The price is reasonable and the Food is fresh

I love this cafe for its coffee, however the toast is excellent too. The coffee is quite a strong one and the condence milk mixed taste very nice. The toast delicious, nice crunch on the outside and soft fluffy in the inside. One of the "good" things about this place is they understand my need for "hard boiled eggs" :). Typical peranakan cafe serve soft boiled eggs so hard boiled eggs is not common, but they made it for me. The shop have its branches all over singapore. I used to visit the one in bugis and lavender. Very nice cafe, nice homey decoration, good coffee and food and warm-friendly store attendance.

Waited for my ferry to Batam and having oversized baggage problem. Having tea and toast bread to kill sometime. Wait staffs do not speak any English only Mandarin. Boiled egg was ok.
Clean, fast and easy.

This place is a saving grace. We were rushing for our theatre show and was so relieved to find Toast Box at Esplanade. Cheap, fast and good. Two thumbs up!!!!

We were sad to have only discovered toast box on the last day in Singapore. Great coffee!!! The peanut butter on toast was so yummy and was happy to try the local jam too.

Average quality food with a decent price. The seating is nice. There is neighboring bakery where you can also get other items to eat (or desert)

Love the Kaya toast and the tea. Cheap and service is also good and fast. Sometimes very crowded and difficult to find a seat. Do not order if cannot get a seat.
Kay toast - Not healthy and rich with bad cholesterol :)

Toastbox is a great place for a catch - up, quick bite and a nice beverage.Peanut butter toast and cold milo were real tasty. Place is well maintained, well lit and managed. Staff are quick to prepare. The self service mechanism suits the joint. Prices are really cheap for good quality stuff.Will go again when in Singapore

The eatery at the basement of Raffles City/Cityhall below the Fairmont Hotel is one of our go-to places if we want to have a quick and cheap breakfast set. Besides coffee or tea, you have the option of choosing toast with various toppings such as otah (spiced fish paste), peanut butter, jam and butter with kaya. Their toast is slightly different as you can choose the thick sliced ones.Don't expect top service. You queue up at the cashier to make and pay for your order, pick up your drinks and head to a table. When your toast is ready, they will call out your order for collection. Queues can be long especially at breakfast as the office crowd comes to pack their cuppa before heading to work

Very ill-mannered service crews that chatted away among them while very unwillingly preparing the food. Ordered a kaya thick toast and the service crew prep, cut and hand over the toast literally with a poker face. Management of the outlet, please make mystery rounds and experience the servicing of your own crews. If they are so unhappy and unwilling to prepare and service the food to the customers pleasantly, stay home!

We went for breakfast several times and I worked my way through the menu. The kaya is great (a kind of coconut based jam/spread), the coffee is fabulous and the soft boiled eggs a revelation! My husband thought they were disgusting - so not for everyone, clearly, but I thought they were marvellous. They really are very soft - actually fully runny - which you break into a shallow dish and season with soy sauce and white pepper before slurping off a spoon or dipping your toast in. I also enjoyed the rather weird sounding "meat floss". which is a savoury, meaty candyfloss-textured concoction that goes on the toast (try laced with condensed milk - no, really!). The coffee met with both our approvals! It is strong and sweet and quite theatrical to watch it being made, with lots of high pours and boiling water. Cost was very reasonable, but the service was universally a bit sullen in the various branches we tried. Can't have it all..
