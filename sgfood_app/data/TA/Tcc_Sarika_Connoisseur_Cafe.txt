The service was very slow here but we were ready for a sit down so were prepared to wait. When the food came it was fine. My bacon cheese and avocado toasted sandwich was delicious. The coffees were good too.

I loved my food! The personnel was super friendly despite the heat. And never have I seen a coffee/dessert menu bigger then here! Would love to come back!!

The food was served hot, fresh and good. It's good old tasty classic dishes served in a food joint without pretending to be a classy restaurant. It is good value for money. 5 stars for taste and service.

Enjoyed my mocha with the professional monogram on it. The macaroons were not the best I have had but were passable. The service was prompt and courteous

We had a lovely meal here and a beautiful bottle of house red wine Not the cheapest place to eat but you are right on Orchard Road!!! The staff were very good and the service was very quick

Superb ambiance, located in Bugies Mall with double height covered Varanda seating. Excellent food and a variety of drinks to select. Ideal for a perfect European continental meal, good value for money.

Friendly, clean, good service and good food.
Prices were reasonable, nothing negative and we enjoyed our dinner.
In particular my husband loved the cheese stuffed meatball over rice. I loved the concocted tea drinks.

Our family has always been patronizing the TCC outlets in Anchor Point especially L2 Harbourfront Walk for years till its recent letdowns thanks to its so-called new menu with much less options as encountered.Its traditional birthday month's one-for-one "thanksgiving" is renegaded and its overall price tags uplifted to over 35% without equivalent F&B quality enhancement. Customer service is not longer cordial and attentive and even hopeless. Simple items like baked rice and shromes etc., are no longer delicious.The outlet is less crowded now for weekend afternoon tea and it expects the patrons to bear with scorching hot and humid ambience...Hardly our choice for another family's afternoon tea

The place is cute, on Orchard Road, the food was good but very expensive.Also there was an offer on the second dish that must have cost at 50% but it was only for breakfast and pasta.The postscript was written with a very small font and therefore not easy to notice.At the end I paid ~55S$ which corresponds to ~38€ but the thing that upset me it was pay well 6S$, i.e. ~4€, for three slices of bread (see photo), that they effectively were simple "bruschetta".So It appears that it is a bit expensive!!!Overall I would not return
