Alvin is very professional in servicing us. Also very patient to us explain what is the different of both high tea. Also make sure all the food comes. We will come back again.

The food is amazing. The duck tortilla wrap is a must try! The presentation for the drinks were amazing as well, very fancy. Will definitely recommend.
4
Great ambience and I love the chairs. Like the food presentation. A lot of drink options. Good service and thoughtful
5
The Lavender tea was marvellous and environmentally was good for an afternoon tea. Good to enjoy with good friends or family.
5
The place provides sofa seats and table for chit-chats over a meal or drinks. Teas are the specialties on their menu. Had their high tea set which cost $42 for 2 pax

The place provides sofa seats and table for chit-chats over a meal or drinks. The name tells it all. Teas are the specialties on menu. Had chicken and waffles with Lady Yang (a lychee tea). Very special and delicious stomach-filled complete meal!
5
My mom loves the mao shan want ice cream and sweet potato fries! After strolling a few km along orchard road, it‚Äôs lovely to sit down, relak and sip the cooling tea!
5
Food was very full of flavours
Drinks took a very long time to arrive
All in all very good food and drinks though tastewise
3
Very surprised to be told we couldn‚Äôt have iced or even tap water. Felt we were given a bit of a hard sales on certain items too. Salad was good and teas were a nice touch. Frittata a bit oily.
4
Good service and nice ambience with a nice view. Staff are very friendly, food was served at a normal pace and was not bad
5
Very nice place for high tea and brunch, convenient location. Worth the price. Really love the lychee tea!
5
Ordered salted egg pasta with prawn, soba, and teatime set. Both the salted egg pasta and soba was good. Teatime‚Äôs set was nice too
4
Ambience & Environment. Very nice lychee tea and variety of tea hot and cold for relaxing and chilling place. Very nice place will definitely the service is great staff is very warm coming as also recommend food and drinks, will come back again.

Love the refreshing ginseng ginger tea! The portion of food is just right too.. satisfied!! Ordered trio pasta with add on smoked salmon , portion just right and deliciously fresh smoked salmon with hand made healthy pasta.
4
Great place, great ambience, good food. Definitely coming back again. A convenient and easy place to find

I love coming to Arteastiq at PS.
It has one of the best ambience for a romantic date and the food is generally good.
The drinks are great especially the Lychee Tea!
Will come back again and again!
Good Job guys!
5
Relaxing atmosphere, variety choices of tea, got a table by the window which is really nice. Having great time with family here.
4
The food and the deco exudes a refine yet quirky vibe. Overlooking the green Istana Park, the calmness in the indoor sets a huge contrast against the hustle and bustle outside the window view. Great place to relax over an exotic flavored cup of tea...The price on the menu is on the higher side for a cafe, but the food does looked carefully crafted. The quiet environment adds to the calm and cozy ai
5
I visited with my family and we ordered the salads and waffles with chicken. All the dishes were beautifully presented and taste was on point. The salads were refreshing, with great sauces to go with it. The waffle was crispy and went perfectly with the syrup. Service was pleasant despite being shorthanded.Will definitely be back here!
4
The foie gras is delicious but this time, there were less items in the menu with it. The service from Alvin was attentive, and he remembered my wife's nut allergy and had the chef modify the recipe. We had lobster two ways and wagyu from the two course sets. Both were creative and superior. Definitely worth experiencing again
5
Love the place, love the food, fabulous environment! We‚Äôd definitely return. We had the window seats which over looked the city, and plush sofas. The food was very appetizing and we had the signature tea - paired with cookies. Very beautiful place. Highly recommended! :)
4
The ambience is good. Nice background music. Good place for chilling out for some tea/snacks. Service staff is friendly and the MONET tea with ice cream was delicious! Not too sweet, just great! (: would definitely drop by again!
4
Came to walk by this boutique tea house and decided to stop for a tea break. We ordered the set for 2. Nice food & good service. Especially the special tea series lycee tea cold, it was very refreshing
5
Have very polite service staff, food is good and the portion is just perfect, will come back again and will recommend others
4
Great place to relax and chill out! The honey lemon tea is very soothing and the duck Foie Gras is delicious!
5
Cozy place for chillax lunch with friends and enjoy tea in a serene ambience! Great place to hang out in town :)
4
Nice environment!
Good tea!
Nice food!
Perfect for a afternoon break!
Recommended for couples and friends!
5
This is my third visit to Arteasiq within a span of three months and I am constantly impressed by its delicious food, pleasant ambience and their polite waiters. I look forward to be their patron once again!
5
Im here in SG for a visit and my friends and I fell inlove with the place, ambiance and teas. It‚Äôs really a must visit place in SG. Definitely a must visit!
4
Lots of tea to choose from. Personal favourite - Lychee tea. Hot or iced it‚Äôs always good. Nice place to chill. Choose the window seats to watch the traffic and people go by.
4
Came here with family. Enjoyed the bangers and mash, the fairy pasta and the wagyu beef from the dinner set menu. Highly recommended for those who can afford it. However, for growing children, the portions may seem lacking.
5
It was a worthy and reasonable price seafood high tea. The seafood were fresh and yummy. Nice and good location
4
Nice ambience with cosy sofa definitely a great place for friends or family gathering. Fantastic food & tea. Services are good.
5
We were here on high tea. It is great exerience. Their tea selectiin is also amazing. We didn't tried anything else from the menu but it looks tempting. I would recomend it.
5
Great food and great ambience. It's my 5th time here!! Welcome!!!!!!!!! Food is delicious and the staff is friendly and Great!
4
One of the best tea varieties you can find in Singapore. Food menu could do with more choices, but is definitely tasty.
3
My family loves their high tea set, and their tea are highly recommended, especially the lychee Tea.
However, the portion of their pasta is so small that it seems like it is the side dish of a main course.
4
Love everything here from the interior, to the presentation of the food and finally the taste - just as good as they look. Totally worth the 30min trip!
5
Lychee tea was aromatic and thirst quenching. The poached eggs were done to perfection.
Five thumbs up and definitely gonna revisit.
2
Didnt have a good experience for lunch here previosly. Staffs were inexperienced and were not customer oriented. Feedback via email but did not get any response all. Then whats the point? Did not feel valued as a customer. Too many menu and too big and not v userfriendly. Should review and change. Their tea is probably the only thing I enjoyed
5
Arteastiq was recommended by a friend and I decided to give it a try. Wonderful ambiance, great service and delicious food. I enjoyed myself immensely.
5
Had the french toast, Beijing duck roll, vanilla latte and chocolate latte. All were great and the staff were very friendly. Nice place to catchup with friends!
4
Ordered crepes and tasted really good! The atmosphere is great for hangout and catching up with friends or family. Will come again for the main another time round
4
It is a nice and good place for tea lover. Suitable for high tea and girls gathering. The desserts are ok too.
4
Recommend Lychee tea & Chicken Waffle. Good ambient for hanging out with friends. Not so crowded..no need to wait in queue.
4
Great for couples and we'll people going solo. The mango strudel.. try it! It has freaking pop rocks!
3
Very interesting tea varieties! Thumbs up for the sweet potato fries! Although our tea turned cold quite fast under the aircon,we enjoyed our visit.
4
Love the double tiered high tea and the Lychee tea! Super refreshing and kept me wanting more! Thanks!
5
1st time to this place. Feel great with the environment n services here. Especially the seafood. It was great, tea was great especially like the ginseng ginger tea. Will come back again. üòöüòç
5
The wide selection of teas did not disappoint and is worth the price of admission. Great ambience and convenient location in town is a bonus.
5
Worth the visit. Awesome food and drinks, guys!
Nice service by the staffs, accommodating.
Will return for more.
5
Treated myself to lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Food was delicious and the people who served me were very pleasant, efficient and professionally. Will definitely come back!

This just going to be short and sweet. The whole experience we had was really pleasant. Will definitely go back here in the future. Food's great, wide selection of teas, quick service. Everything in one package. Good job!
4
Great ambience, friendly & attentive service, food portion was just nice for our tea time. Worth a second visit üòä
4
Had a good time during art jam. Food & dessert were nice and staff were friendly. Would recommend people to come & experience art jam as well.
5
Soft lighting, good selection of music and a wide variety of tea makes this a unique hideout for friends gathering.
5
Unique experience and good spread of variety. Good selection of tea and coffee. Recommended by a friend. It didnt disappoint me and my wife.
4
Good service with good food
Tea is great and warm
Not too hot which is very good for food
The location is also convenient for commuter that just locates in mrt.
5
Can chill out with friends while having good food with reasonable peice in great ambiance!
Service is good!
Celebrated birthday here and staffs are helpful!
1
Nice decor, quiet space, comfortable atmosphere. However service could be improved, food portions small and not the freshest. Staff requested to take a photo of the review before it can be posted.
5
Brought my Hubby here for the 1st time. We love the food, Tea and relaxing ambience. Most importantly, good service.
5
This is a great place to have a peaceful and relaxed afternoon with friends. Have been here many times and have nv been disappointed!
5
Enjoyed the great food as usual, lovely ambience and great for catching ups between friends. Lychee tea is always a favorite and love the teatime set as well.
5
The service at Arteastiq (plaza singapura) is awesome and I would recommend those that are in town. They are quite professional in producing their service.
5
The decor is impressive. Despite manpower shortage, the serving crew is doing their best to manage the situation. Great way to kick off the New Year lunch here.
5
Awesome service & ambience (natural lightings for photos!)
Food was tasty and compliments each other!
4
A best place to come with your friends to have a small catch up and chill. Love they're tea as is very relaxing.
4
Lychee tea is light & refreshing ! The main dish is creative, unique & taste bud fulfilling... The ambience is nice as well!!!!!
5
We came here for lunch and found the food good and place relaxing. We had the rib eye with foie gras, asked for medium and it was done to our expectations. The quesadillas and high tea set was also good. Nice ambience, would come back again.
4
There are wide range of tea selections and we got ourselves the dessert tea. It was awesome with gelato and fruit tea! Hi tea set is highly recommended to friends who enjoys tea and light bites from savories to sweets. Very delicate and delicious! Interior ambience are perfect for an afternoon like this to relax with friends. Not too crowded and good service!Thumbs up
4
Great variety of food and drinks offered on the menu. One of the few places I'll regularly visit with my friends when we need a cosy place to unwind and just catch up!
4
Good food great ambience. Heavy on eggs. Has a huge selection of teas and coffee. Look forward to I going there again
4
I love the pomelo tea and special cookies. There are variety of tea to choose. The environment is cozy. However, the tea can not be refilled.
5
The crab cake is amazing.
Egg was done perfectly. Though the Arrabiata Stew was on the sour side.
Coffee is great. Will definitely come again
5
Cozy place for relaxing & unique weekday. A good place to chill n enjoy a peaceful afternoon. Chrysanthemum wolfberry & lime lemon tea r nice & refresh ^^ The food also good in presentation & taste wise ^^
4
Good food with beautiful ambience with cosy environment. The high tea is definitely worth spending a wonderful afternoon at. The food are definitely worth trying. There are 2 branches and both are good.
4
We ordered the deluxe Treasury high tea for 2 and didn't waited very long even though the place was almost full at 3pm on a sat. The staff are friendly especially Mr Alvin. Overall had a good experience here except that the seats are too closed to other patrons.
4
We came here to celebrate our son‚Äôs 20th birthday. Nice ambience. Well-lit room with comfy chairs. Kids get to spend meaningful time to create their own canvas paintings ‚Äî the main draw why we are here. Our only complaint is the two sets of high tea came more than half an hour apart. While it‚Äôs supposed to be a relaxed setting, we still find it somewhat unsettling when a pair has a watch the other pair eat. Naturally we shared our food, which came in small bite sized portions so it‚Äôs easy to share.
4
All the brunch are delicious! Love the salted egg pasta!!! Tea are served in a tray with paring biscuis (spicy and salty cookie), we like the tea but dont like the biscuits. Dessert is disappointing, many are out of stock and the actual plate is totally different than the picture from menu. Next time, i would rather order more brunch and skip the dessert. Nice restaurant and great for photos! Will definitely come back for their yummy all day brunch! Slow service hope they can be more attentive.

Decided to visit this place after a previous visit.. Had my infant with a stroller. Requested for a cushion seat and despite it being available the managed declined although the staff was about to guide us there. Threw some menus on the table in a random manner. I am not a dog. So do not throw the menus on the table like that. The manager alvin blended some coffee or chocolate latte and then put the spoon in his mouth. It was a filthy sight. He seem to be bullying his staff who were two young students pleasant and given the most load of the work. If alvin can't work politely and with hygiene and also treat customers rather rudely... Maybe alvin should quit. Please check your cctv so u can see the joy of alvin putting things in his mouth. We left after being ignored for awhile. Thank you dirty Alvin. Sorry for those students hope u find a better manager. Alvin also stop screaming in chinese in the bar. Its rather unpleasant. U might come across as psychotic.
4
We spend our afternoon here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It is really relaxing here with nice ambience and soothing music. Accompanied by brunch that is filling and delicious. Not to mention about their Earl Grey tea, it is amazingly good.
5
Cozy place for relaxing unique n yummy high tea.a good place t chill n njoy peaceful aftnoon. Yammy high tea & green tea cheese cake.Chrysanthemum wolfberry is refreshing, roasted hazelnut chocolate blenciato n roasted hazelnut chocolate blency are rich
4
Friendly and attentive staff. Tea was good as well. Would definitely recommend this place to friends!
3
service is ok...but need longer time to finish the paintings. great food presentation and Happy to have so many choices of tea . but maybe have more finger food.
4
A good place to chill. Extremely good selections of exquisite teas, a few interesting coffee options, brunch/lunch/desserts options as well. A bit pricey, but worth it
5
Very delicious food and unique tea varieties. Great view sitting next to windowseat! Tea and food looks extremely pleasant and tastes good
5
Great ambience for chill out. Service was both effective and efficient. Tea set served was exquisite. Highly recommend!!!
4
The best place to chill for an afternoon tea. Great, cozy ambience. Always refreshing tea (Iced Lychee Tea, my favourite) and healthy food served fresh. One plus point is the timely and consistent service level in every visit üëçüèª
5
Nice ambience and good food and drinks, would recommend to bring friends and family here to chill out
4
Arteastig√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s peaceful and curated ambience was a perfect retreat from the bustle of Orchard Road. Full-length windows overlooking the road below provided ample lighting and created a cheery atmosphere. The staff was also very helpful in helping us choose from the huge menu! Only cons were the slightly irritating sound of ventilation from the ducting above
4
2 more days to Christmas & am already eating away. These are simply delicious... Boston Love Boat & iced lychee tea
3
Great food but it was slightly pricey for the proportion given. The presentation of food was pretty. Service could be better.
5
Place has good ambience and music. Staff were welcoming. Even though the bell didn't really work but they attended to us promptly. Design of teas were exqusite.
4
Nice ambience.Friendly staff. Crabcake and pasta very nice with Lychee tea. price wise was ok too.recommended
5
Love the ambiance of the restaurant! Cozy & relaxing. Most of all, I love the varieties of teas they have! A must go chill out location!!!
3
First visit to this place. Nice ambience but the selection of food can be improved. Food was not up to expectation.
4
Visited for afternoon tea. Lychee tea was really good and is a must-order! The set had a combination of savoury and sweet items which were just nice for tea time. Perhaps can invest in blinds for the seats by the windows.
5
This place has nice cosy ambience . Nice food with friendly and helpful staffs with good service . Thumbs up
4
Staff are friendly and helpful. Tea is good and beautiful table settings
Its a great place to chill with friends
4
The high tea set for 2 is nice and affordable with choices of 2 speciality tea or coffee. Have chosen the honey lavender tea which is fragrant and nice to taste. Another choice is the Belgium Chocolate coffee which is rich and creamy. The savoury and sweet bites on the high tea set are equally tasty. Worth the money and time to be here
4
Nice decoration. Beautiful cutleries and good selection of food. The French toast was awesome - soft yet tasty with brie.
5
Love the ambience and the variety of tea! Great service and presentation of food üëçüèª Only gripe is that it‚Äôs slightly crammed inside
5
Chicken and waffle was delicious!
Amazing service and great Christmas music - will come back again :)
5
Awesome view to boost when you are seated at the window seats, food was excellent and has a huge portion
5
Good service, great food and nice ambience.
The waiter and waitress are very friendly. Very nice and cozy place.
5
Classy and chill atmosphere. Food is better than expected and has good flavour. Friendly and helpful staff.
5
Nice food nice drink nice environment...we love the lychee tea...Will come again...my son love the ice chocolate!!!
4
The waiter recommended fizzy earl grey. It‚Äôs soooo nice and refreshing. Love it! The ribeye did not disappoint us too. Very juicy n tender. Fried chicken waffles is average. Was expecting the waffles and fried chicken to be a lil bit more crispy. There are lots of choices for tea. The ambiance is nice and cozy too. Would love to laze here for the whole afternoon or after shopping :)
3
Had a lovely Sunday lunch with my family here. Dishes we had: Bangers and mash, waffles and chicken and arrabiata stew. Overall, the food was really yummy - we all left with satisfied tummies! But the salad greens could've have been fresher. Many yellowed and shrivelled leaves in our dishes. We also had lychee tea and masala chai latte. The former was definitely the highlight of the meal! The servers were a tad slow in coming to take our orders after the service bell was pressed a couple of times. Guess this would be something we hope arteastiq could improve on! Will be back - hopefully to receive better service and fresher greens the next time!
4
The food is reasonable portion and good.. staff is friendly and enthusiastic in the food recommendation.. one suggestion would be that it will be better if the cafe can provide complimentary cake for diners whom are celebrating birthday there.. we were there to celebrate my 2 friends‚Äô birthday but were somehow disappointed with the cake selection.
4
Nice ambience. We enjoy the every course from starter to main. They taste delicious. Will definitely bring friends here again.
3
Ambience is good and staffs are friendly.
In addition, the design of the coffee is nice.. Good!!! :)
5
Tried the steak and set lunches today. The steak was done perfectly and felt tender, while the earl grey tea and mint lemongrass tea was a soothing way to end a first memorable experience here. Ambience is great for a relaxing afternoon.
4
Food was pretty good, would try the teas next time! Nice ambience for a relaxing brunch with friends.
5
The food here is fresh and tasty. The cafe has a good atmosphere and is very relaxing to enjoy a cup of tea after a long day at work.
4
Kids love the food. Good presentation and friendly waitress. Nice atmosphere. Innovative display. Convenient location. Sat at sofa corner, quiet despite the crowd in restaurant.
5
We had the hi-tea set which was a very interesting combination of sweets and savouries. Must try is the crab cakes. Service is always good.
4
Good tea and great ambience. Big windows provide great views of the city. Good service and presentation.
4
The tea selection is impressive. Healthy salads come in great varieties. Portion is just right for ladies. Not to mention ambience is great.
1
Absolutely terrible. I would have chosen 0 star if given a choice. Even with the Amex 50% off, this is not at all worth any cents. The prawn "bisque" was watery and bland. A bowl of prawn noodle soup from any hawker centre would have tasted better. The crab cake has a weird taste to it. The salted egg yolk capellini has no salted egg yolk taste at all and it was bland. Arugula was used to garnished every dish, even the soup. Basically, it seemed like an arugula meal for my wife and myself. The only thing that was of restaurant standard was the lavender panna cotta, not that it's a really good panna cotta (cos it was too stiff and not jiggly enough) but probably only because that was the only dish that had enough taste and flavour. We left the restaurant feeling frustrated despite the 50% off
4
We ordered 2 types of tea. Both has unique aroma.
Pastry are so so.1 server is a bit cold to customer.
4
I'd totally remember this place for their tea. Their Ginger Spice tea was of best tea I had. Nice ambience to do work in one seating too.
4
Always here for their selection of teas. Very cozy place to chill and catch up with friends and family :)
5
nice food and ambience.. come and try their Farmers breakfast and cold lychee tea set... reasonable price and good service by their stuffs.. will def be back for more..
1
Tasteless food, slow service, and worst of all they don't even serve complimentary plain water. Not worth visiting.
4
Awesome tea~ delicious food.. great ambience ! Service mediocre.. nice place to chill , relax and hang out with loved ones !
4
We had the brunch here and they were tasty. But what won us over is the tea and cookies set. Many interesting tea and they were priced reasonably. Highly recommended to go there for high tea.
4
A great variety of tea, from traditional tea, flower tea, etc etc. My personal favourite is the lychee ice tea. While my wife tried the new series of collagen resin french rose recommended by the manager - Alvin, which is good too.A worth visiting relaxing tea place on a lazy Sunday
5
Nice ambience and comfortable although it's a pity that we were unable to get window seats.I like their tea set which is very elegant and aromatic. I ordered French rose tea with collagen which is not too sweet but taste good.Great hearty brunch and friendly staff
3
I went together with a date on a Saturday late afternoon. As expected, the restaurant was packed when we arrived. We were quite lucky to get seats as the restaurant only allows reservations for customers who are having the Luscious Seafood High Tea for 2 set. Our first impressions of the restaurant were good, looking at its all-day breakfast and drinks menu which is tastefully designed and features plenty of unique dishes and selection of tea. We had the Rage of the Spartans, Prince of Monte Carlo - Duck Confit Sandwich, Reminiscence - Tiramisu and Chamomile Passionfruit Tea. Service is decent, but they do seem to be understaffed. I believe the restaurant can do better with one additional staff to serve the customers, rather than just having one poor guy running around to serve during peak hours. I can already see him perspiring profusely at the forehead. One thing to note, however, is that they do not serve complimentary water in this restaurant. Water will cost you $5 a pop over here. Well, that's one way to nudge your customers to order more tea from you. However, I am sure many customers just prefer to have some water after a meal to wash down any lingering taste. Not cool. There are better ways to promote your drinks, and this approach is amateurish.Overall, this place is somewhat worth a visit if you are keen on their selection of food and tea, but you will think twice about returning. The restaurant management should look into stepping up their game to provide diners with a better overall experience
4
we tried the honey lavendar and red date oolong which were great. also tried the farmer's breakfast which was quite well done
3
Service was okay, food was fine too. Ambience was good and experience was great. Value for money, great.
4
Having French Rose Tea with Tiramisu
The interior design very cozy
Such great and have a comfortable afternoon time
5
Nice ambience, love the ice cream!
I wanna come back to try the French Rose Vanilla ice cream dessert drink~
5
The location is good which is on the 3rd floor in Plaza Singapura just above Dhoby Ghaut MRT. The food and drinks are nice too.
2
I had the Beijing Dynasty - Crepes Au Canard Confit while my friend ordered the French Affection - Ribeye. The duck was so salty it was like eating salted duck. So much oil was oozing out of the crepes that the whole plate was covered with oil.The sweet potato chips that came with the ribeye were dry, hard and not at all crispy.The Lychee Tea was very nice though - fragrant and sweet. The 2 spicy shrimp flavoured cookies that came with the tea were also very interesting.Paid using the 1-1 entertainer app. Otherwise the food is rather pricey for the quality of food.Service was also very slow. We had finished drinking the tea when the food finally arrived
4
The service provided here is good. We like the ambience of the place and the teas and drinks here are great. Food portions are a little small. We had the salad, fritata and chicken & waffles those were alright.Overall I'd come back again for the place, snacks and food. Would recommend.
1
Ambiance and service were fine. Food left a lot to be desired. Ordered the farmers breakfast. Based on the menu it came with 4 pieces of bacon, eggs, a salad and mushrooms with toast. There were 2 pieces of bacon, a half slice of toast and about 1kg of flavourless mushrooms covering half the plate. Also being a tea house I would not expect to be unable to order hot water without paying $5 for it. Charging for hot water is understandable being Singapore, but $5 is borderline ridiculous. $91 for two people for breakfast. Just crazy. We won‚Äôt be back unfortunately.
4
I have not visited Arteastique in a while. I have tried the other shop in Mandarin Gallery and it did me quite a good impression so I decided to try it again this time at Plaza Singapura for an impromptu birthday celebration for a friend.They have this value for money 3-course meal which includes Appetizer-Mains-Dessert.For the appetizer, we have tried Seafood Mushroom Broth and Pan Seared Duck Foie Gras. The soup is nice and aromatic, but we enjoyed the foie gras better. For the mains, we had Herb Crusted Codfish and Wagyu Ribeye. The codfish is cooked nicely, while the ribeye is nicely done as well. We enjoyed both.The dessert turns out to be the greatest surprise. The Mango Strudel are nice and flaky, not overly sweet, but the mango could‚Äôve been sweeter, but overall, still quite nice... The best of the best is the Chocolate Ginger Mousse with Chocolate Soil. It is quite a refreshing flavor especially accompanied with Champagne Vanilla Ice Cream and Mini Coffee Flavored Macaron.The dinner turns out to be better than expected. We had a great time! We were seated in cushioned seats that we get to talk comfortably with privacy. The ambience is chic and classy. Very nice place
1
Great ambience with pretentious cocktails and food that are overpriced . My partner and I decided to try the two course meal being we always walked past and wanted to try their food . We were first greatly disappointed by their cocktails of which were either disgustingly sweet or repulsively sour . When we asked the waiter if the passionfruit lavander cocktail was suppose to be so sour he replied ‚Äú that‚Äôs what passionfruit tastes like , sour . ‚Äú and just walked away. Both of us being Bartenders were extremely dissatisfied with such a response as having years of experience in the industry we could tell the drinks were slightly imbalanced , perhaps lacking syrup of some sort . As for the food , my wagyu steak was overly salted and my partner‚Äôs lobster just bland . Extremely disappointed with the food drinks and the overall pretentious facade that misleads their customers . Would never come back again. Would never recommend to anyone 
4
Ordered the Caramel Latte and sweet endings - pineapple upside down cake. Presentation of the drink n cake looks great and goes with the Taste...... üëçüèøüëçüèø
5
Arteastiq at PS has a really warm and welcoming ambience that is perfect for a Sunday afternoon. The food was delicious (waffles and fries) and the decor was beautiful. :)
4
The whisky hot chocolate was great! Would definitely come back for more. High tea menu looks interesting
4
Their tea is very nice. It will be better if their teapot is double wall. The truffle sweet potato is a must try! Overall great service and great ambience. Will visit again!
5
Love their salted egg pasta and lemon grass tea! Will come back again! Nice ambience with soothing music. good together with friends.. hitea is da best ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô
5
Well thought out dishes and their fruit teas are to die for. You can both indulge or eat healthily here.
4
Good service and great ambience. Have more desserts that can be appealed to kids/teenagers. Enjoyable experience overall.
4
Lovely ambience, teas are creatively presented. Was upset with the delay in food serving but was wow by how good it was so it didn't bother me much. Had the Monarchy Bangers & Mash.
5
Tucked in a cosy corner in Plaza Singapura, Arteastiq is the perfect place to bring your dates to. Romantic ambience, great food, fantastic service - what more can you ask for?
2
Brought my mum here for her birthday because I thought, wow such a pretty cafe with artsy brunch creations! Food was disappointing and just not worth the stomach space. Here‚Äôs what you should avoid:1. Salmon wellington - Salmon wasn‚Äôt fresh. Tasted pungent. - Pastry was crummy and dry2. Salted egg pasta- This didn‚Äôt taste like salted egg at all- Was very dry and over cooked. Thank god the portion was small because we couldn‚Äôt stomach any more of it3. Tri-colour pasta- Why is this pasta dish even classified as a main? It should be a salad because it is so dry and bland 4. Spinach frittata - we paid $16 for a dry omelette 5. Loveboat cioppino - the only saving grace- prawns in the broth were over cooked though Did I also mention that the waiters and waitresses are rude, snarky and curt?
4
Rather good food, but staff were rather unresponsive. Price may be a bit too much to pay for a meal like this.
5
Very nice high tea set and awesome tea selections. Prompt service, highly recommended for small group of friends gatherings.
5
Good food, awesome drinks, great service and nice ambiance. If you're looking for a place to chill and have brunch then this place is a must try!
5
Really good and special coffee mix, nice decoration and music, good location, accessible, service is prompt and good and friendly and food is huge in portion
5
Loving this place. Great service. Will be back.
The high tea is recommended.
The have art classes here too!

Nice ambience! A very good place for afternoon tea. love the cookies that accompanied with dandelion tea, a little bit spicy which goes well with tea. Very special. The teasery set is ok...... Worth visit for the beverages and maybe other desserts.
5
Awesome place; great tea selection and wonderful ambience :)
My girl pal and I absolutely loved the high tea here, Would definitely recommend this place!
4
Was here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Weather was really crazy and their staff heard my request for a "cooler" table. Brought me right in to a cozy corner where the aircon was stronger. Appreciate this little touch that made a difference to my dining experience. Food is awesome as always and I like the restaurant ambience where it was perfect for chilling in. Will definitely be back again
3
Ambience is nice for a nice quiet chat with friends. Tables are arranged too close for comfort especially when restaurant is full. A lot of variety for tea and Coffee. Food is good overall although pricey. Service can be faster and better. Staff appear too harassed.
4
I was pretty impressed by the hi tea set at mandarin gallery so I brought my hubby to try the branch at plaza branch. The food is of the same standard. We also ordered the Boston Lovers seafood soup bowl that we enjoyed. We definitely will return for the tea. One thing that puts us is the loud conversation of the kitchen staff as we are seated near to the kitchen.
4
Cozy place to catching up with friend. Nice food and with reasonable price. Definitely will recommend friend to come here.
4
We enjoyed the ginger tea and lavender earl grey tea! It was not too crowded on a Sunday which makes it perfect.
4
Great ambience. Nice tea and excellent service:) macha cheesecake and the relax tea is greatüëç will definitely recommend
4
Good tea selection and nice and cozy ambience love the service and well be back again..my friends really love this place.
5
Great ambience! Nice place to come for afternoon tea or a meal with friends. It's a bit pricey though.
4
Nice desserts! And nice view! First place to visit when I reached Singapore. Enjoy the moment at here. Relax~
3
This is the tea equivalent of a hipster cafe, and I mean that in the best way possible! Good place to study, work and have intimate conversations
5
This is my favourite place for tea session with friends and family.. Staff are very friendly and attentive also welcoming. Great beverage with good ambience, always love the teas here.. will be back again and again!
4
We are here for teas. The spacious compound at the tea house makes the place look very cozy and allow us to enjoy quality time. We ordered a dandelion tea and it comes with a complimentary honey and the masala chai was good too.
5
Came here with my gf for the signature teasary set and it certainly lived up to expectations. The desserts were elegantly displayed and there was a wide selection of teas to choose from. And the food tasted really good too! For only $48++ def worth it(
4
Tried the duck canap√©s and Boston love boat. Tasty and fresh ingredients. The pear tea is very sweet and thirst quenching.
4
restaurant with a great ambience. perfect for a chillax afternoon. Highly recommend cold pear tea for a refreshing taste!
4
This place is nice natural lighting with floor to wall windows. Good place to chill with a wide selection of drinks including an assortment of tea and cakes and some mains from the all day brunch menu
3
Great place to chill. Lychee tea is a must try. Food is so so. The level of stew in the Boston love boat has shrunk significantly and there was hardly any stew by the time it was served to us. Won't be returning anytime soon.
5
Nice place and good place for tea.
Cheap and reasonable price for couple. Best place for couple and frens gathering.
5
The food was amazingly fantastic! Tea selection was extensive and very very nicely presented. We will definitely recommend this to anyone who loves luxury high tea exexperience with an affordable price tag
5
Staff is very nice and patient! Especially Hui ling shows courtesy on customers , all foods n drinks are delicious and awesome! Go to PS ( U will not regret one ) Unlikely at the one at mandarin , forcing ppl to order the high tea set .
5
I wanted a quiet place for a meal on the weekdays, away from the office lunch crowd and I found it nestled at the corner of Plaza Singapura√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s relatively new wing. They were having the brunch specials. Free soup of the day and dessert with every main ordered and 1-for-1 beverages.This boutique tea house lives up to its name. The dishes were artistically presented and I especially love their range of special teas. Service crew were friendly and accommodating. I will definitely come back again with friends. Worth every penny spent
4
Staff was accommodating in allowing us to switch from art jam to a high tea session. The recommended tea flavours (pomelo and lychee) are nice. The ambience of the cafe will be good, if not for the pop music blasting from the neighbouring shop. Staff is attentive and quite pleasant. The sofa seats seem comfy, but they were fully occupied when we were there
5
This is our third visit to this cosy eatery. The decor of the restaurant exudes a very arty feel. But, it is the quality of the food served here that draws us back. The afternoon tea for two at $48 is a good offer as it also comes with two pot of quality tea.This place is highly recommended if you want to spend a lazy afternoon with your loved ones or simply just to escape from the hustle and bustle of life
5
Great to hang out and good food and awesome ambience must try the lychee tea. Good tea selection and food options
5
We had chicken & waffles with earl grey and mint lemon tea - good meal before we start our painting. Friendly staff and cosy environment. Canvas, brushes, acrylic paints are all there for 3 hours of artistic expression. Great way to spend a weekday afternoon!
4
Nice dessert tea which came with the afternoon tea set for 2. Cosy environment. Outlet was not crowded on a Sunday afternoon.
5
Teas and coffees were awesome - service staff were really nice too and even help us switch tables when one by the window freed up. Very comfy to sit and chill.
2
Nice ambience, pretty food presentation. However quality of food & drinks is nothing spectacular. We had the chicken waffles, farmers breakfast, tomato soup & osmanthus tea.
4
Nice cosy environment, with lovely selection of tea. The dessert tea was an interesting refreshing combination
5
Nice environment for birthday celebration , Must try the lychee ice tea . And price is still reasonable.
5
Nice and quite environment with friendly staff. All foods are well presented. Try out their cold lychee tea, you will for sure come back again.
5
Good service by the staffs. Food is good. Love the Honey Lavender & Oolong tea too. Place is also quite quite, good for couples & friends.
5
Friendly and approachable staff. Nice ambience to chill and relax on a lazy Sunday drinking my cup of flora tea.
4
Nice food and the selection of teasury is good. Able to select tea from a variety of items. Good environment.
5
Nice selection of fine cakes and sandwich. Great tea to go along. We decided to go for the high tea set for 2. A lot of choices for the tea, either hot or cold. Chamomile passion fruit tea is a good choice. Poping sweets.
4
We love coming here for afternoon tea! The tea blends are amazing. We had a honey lavender tea, and it came with cookies and a sprig of lavendar!
5
We had our high tea here for a few times and it was awesome. The dinner is well prepared as well. Overall lovely experience
5
My friends and I were really enjoying the afternoon high tea at Arteastiq Plaza Singapura! Food was great! Staffs are friendly! Good atmosphere! High recommended!
2
Food taste overall is average. Sauce is generally good.
Price is high.
Won't recommend. Won't return.
Good place for photo taking. Not great for food.
Decoration is interesting.
Service is polite but slower. Likely due to understand.
5
Nice place for chilling out but we just missed out on their high tea. Will definitely be back to try!
4
Had a wonderful tea session here at Arteastiq, the tea set for 2 was nice! Really liked the savory choices :)
4
Food presentation was pretty, tasty and overall experience was warm and friendly. Location convenient jus above the mrt station....
4
We were 3 here to have gathering. We ordered Chicken waffles, Crabcake and normal mushroom soup. The waffles presentation is nice and yummy. However the texture is a bit hard and overburnt. Crabstick is with a running York, texture is nice and creamy. The selection of tea is really too much. I ordered the Lavender tea, very relaxing tea set. I will come again for this place!
2
We like the tea combination here - lychee tea; tea with cinnamon etc.
For those who want free water, don't bother to ask. Bring your own hot water, room temperature water and an extra cup!üòÇ There is no refill for the pot of tea!
3
Food presentation is good, cosy environment but food taste can be improved. Staff is attentive but bell doesnt work well at our table. A little on the pricey side for the food and beverages. Overall, a fair experience.
5
Service was great, nice ambience and nice food :) will definitely come again :) and recommend Friends and family to come
4
Warm, cosy and therapeutic ambience. Colonial style beautiful interior decoration Food is aesthetically presented and delicious!
4
The food was presented in an elegant manner that is sure to whet your appetite. We ordered both the tea sets. Portions were generous and had great variety. Will definitely visit again.
3
Good ambient ...
Ordered the chicken salad ... interesting combo with waffles
"Heads up"... beware of the low lying lighting :)
4
Ate the 2 course meal and was delicious, however could be better if they have more of such promotions and ala carte selection without these promo. But anyway great ambience and always love their tea especially lychee tea üòä
5
Incredibly good service and food :) not to mention the Instagram worthy photos to be taken here! Thumbs up!
5
Having a nice quality tea time in Plaza. Like the lychee & pear tea the most! Also like the service here!
4
Had a good time catching up in comfy lime sofas with a good view.Teas were refreshing but the bite sized canapes we had for the tea set were ok but not outstanding. Reasonable value for money considering the location.Service was also average but good to have a buzzer given that they were understaffed and the staff were not particularly enthusiastic 
4
Came here for tea with my friends, nice cosy ambience. Love the lychee and red date tea! Served with exotic cookies, that taste like Hae bee Hiam & curry puff
4
The food is good and the overall ambience is nice although wasn't given the window seat as per requested in chope. They have many special tea. Worth the try
4
Ambience is great, serves photogenic tea sets which tastes good as well, overall a very good place to hang out and chat with your friends.
5
great ambience with delicious food.
beautiful plating of food
love the sweet lychee tea which was recommended by them
definitely will come back again
4
Great Place for chill up if your need a cozy and quiet place !!

Excellent food especially the premium lychee tea! Unique experience. Exquisite ambience with great serving staff. Thumbs up!
4
Nice display of food and drinks. Nice ambience and good service. Good place to spend the afternoon at.
5
Spend my leave at Arteastiq , 1st attempt on painting , great way to release pressure . Very helpful staff , thanks Kian Hong for the fantastic service provided , will definitely come back again .
4
Good place to have a lunch with colleagues : friends or loved ones. There are plenty of beverages to choose from too!
5
Excellent services & customers first attitude is gladly appreciated. We all feel at home when we are here.
4
Wide range of interesting tea offered. Love the ginger tea with spiced rum and whisky, as well as the lychee cold tea. Food served with reasonable portion and price. Excellent setting.
5
Great ambience and lovely decorations. Unique food menu and beautiful presentation. Most importantly, excellent service.
5
Nice presentation of the dishes and service was attentive. Would have been better if there is more main course selection though. Worth giving it a try!
4
I had the vegetarian dishes here- nice and simple pasta and truffle sweet potatoes fries.
good food. Definitely worth a visit for vegetarians.
4
Came on a friday afternoon to have some tea session with mom. Friendly staff and nice tea set. Overall nice place to chit chat.
5
Fisrt time visit.
Good environment, good service.
Excellent tea. Nice sofa set with nice view.
Definitely will visit again.
4
1st time visited here at here for Teatime. Ordered 2 pax tea time set. Now interior decoration and quite crowded.
5
We have a wonderful time here and he foods here are good too. They also provide good service with cozy environment.
3
Cosy. Nice ambience.Food not bad.Ordered 1 hot tea, it was fragrant & strong flavoured but it was a waste nt allowing to refill 2nd time & we weren't told that it could only be refilled once, would appreciate staff to be friendly enough to inform.The staff nv smile and not much facial expression, basically just cold
5
Had a wonderful dinner here. Had a good window view and the ambience of the whole cafe is really cosy. Oh and also, they have a wide selection of teas so if you are a tea connoisseur, do check out their tea menu. Osmanthus and wolfberry tea is strongly recommended!
5
Great ambience, comfortable chairs, quiet environment, excellent tea and great service- indeed a perfect place for an afternoon catch up with friends.
5
The drinks are awesome, and the cake (Matcha Cheesecake) is really good! Service staff is friendly and able to help us with our orders.
5
Good hangout place for friends. Recommended. We had pear tea, cod fish and tiramisu. Will definitely come back again
5
2 course w/ starter , Two-way lobster was recommend by Staff Alvin which was delicious. Splendid Service and food !
4
Nice place to chill and have brunch. Food is so so and prices are definitely high. Get the window seats that overlook Orchard Road!
1
Terrible food, terrible service, terribly overpriced. Menu is boring. Preparation is pedantic. Medium streak was raw. We asked to have it cooked more and the waitress acted like it was so so complicated.
5
This place is awesome! Very relaxing atmosphere not to mention the excellent service plus yummylicious food!! Thumbs up!
4
All is good ... value for money! Great ambience. Highly recommended. Nice place for afternoon tea & to chill
2
I came here with expectations after seeing the reviews from others. Left the place with lots of disappointment. The food is simply lousy. We ordered the high tea set. Very lousy. Not worth the S$48.00 that I paid for. But I must say that the ambience is good. Quiet and comfortable sofa. Will not recommend to go
4
Was surprised it's quiet and not crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon. Choose the tables along the window for a good view. Theres a wide selection of teas for tea enthusiasts. Food wise, I find the portions slightly too small for the price. At least the presentation and taste were good.
3
Brunch was a hearty experience. Had the Viva Duck - nice blend of Flavours with veg and smoked duck
Cappuccino was frothy and rich
However wait staff could be more attentive with the refill of water and clearing of plates
4
Food were exquisitely arranged and presented. Nice cosy ambience and waiters were attentive and friendly. even had a bell system to call for waiters and ask for bill.
3
Good value of foods n drinks....but refill of water should be allow for the tea when we order the special set lunch...as there are no water served
4
Good restaurant, with good service. Food is awesome too, seats and environment are very pleasant. Will visit again
3
Came here a few times and always ordered the same dish - buratta brunch which is lovely but you can't really mess up on this dish. It's the other ones that were a bit disappointing. I guess my advice would be to come for afternoon tea cuz that seems to be more popular. It's quiet during dinner time. Love the comfy sofa seats tho. Was exhausted and nearly fell asleep.
4
If you would like the window seats, good to make a reservation as they are popular. We liked the appetizer with foi gras (panini morsi). A generous amount of foi gras. For the main course, the Boston Love boat was interesting in terms of the tomato-based soup. However, the pastry covering was a bit too 'doughy' - not as flaky as what used to be served in the now defunct Country Manna restaurant. The other main dish, salted egg yolk capellini (Symphony from the East) was an interesting fusion dish, with thai basil. The salted egg cream was just right, not too overwhelming, but with salted egg to feel satisfying. Finally, the dessert we chose, the professional, despite the fanciful name, was basically a tiramisu. Pleasant, and sufficient moist - though sadly not with alcohol. Overall a pleasant meal, esp with a coupon which entitled us to 20% discount. The only slight flaw in the experience was that the waitress who did our bill told us after the dinner the discount did not cover the set dinner - when we were told explicitly by another waiter that it did. However, this was quickly settled and the discount was given. (The coupon explicitly stated set dinner
5
My friend took me to this place to try french food for dinner. The place is very beautiful, its cozy and artistic. Its something different from other restaurants ive been. The food presentation is perfect! Although i must admit im not really a fan of french food but i can say that its nice. The staff are also very helpful. A must place to go. :

Arteastiq rides on the upswell of great, boutique-y food spots that have sprung up across Singapore in recent years. Their combination of interesting teas with a well presented and ambitious three course menu made it worth a visit.I wish we hadn't bothered.First things first. When you're charging $60+ for an entry level bottle of wine, and $45+ for a meal, it is absolutely not acceptable for there not to be free water and proper napkins on the table. The waiter's answer was that, as a tea room, they're not required to do so. Rubbish. When your branding and prices say high end, you have to act the part too.Unfortunately, the poor experience extended beyond these quibbles. The service was poor, with our meals arriving 20 minutes apart and our plates not cleared until 30 minutes after we'd finished eating. The food, despite the creativity of the menu, was flavourless and, at best, lukewarm. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that they are part of the Entertainer application, which mean we got a discount off our meal. Nevertheless, the overall experience was very disappointing, and we will not be returning
5
The afternoon tea set is so pretty for two pax. Ambience in Plaza Singapura is quiet and cozy. Perfect for afternoon ladies afternoon meet-up. The service was above average. Selection of savoury and sweet nibbles on the tea set are presented in a beautiful cage tray. Well done. However, the sweet cakes selection can be cut down or can be done with slightly less sweet as the nation is fighting with diabetes. Perhaps another suggestion to have more savoury stuff and less sweet macaroon.
4
This restaurant has a great selection of tea. The food presentation is very artistic. I ordered a dessert, Stranger's poetry. It is basically a deconstructed matcha cheese cake. I couldn't identify it when it was served. My friend had the salted-egg spaghetti and it was yummy! Yes, i agree with the other reviewer that the air-con can be quite strong and service quite inattentive. Overall, worth the visit
3
Hot piping sweet potato fries, tastes equally good even when cold.
Orders salmon puff, portion was huge but normal.
Steak came well done though we ordered medium.
Only a place suitable for drinks and sweet potato fries.
Give their mains a miss. Not worthwhile.
5
I've been visiting this cafe more than 4years. Include mandarin Orchard one. Tea is perfect taste for me. Cozy, good view by the windows :)
5
It was nice and quiet with a lovely view. Food variety was great. The tea selection was comprehensive too.
4
The ambience of the place is great for people who will like to slow down their footsteps and catch a breather from work :) love the deco of the place
3
Venue and food is good. Service was bad. Table was not ready at my appointed time as listed in the customer reservation list. Many tables were not cleared after the last customer. Staff were not in team spirit as they waited for each other to initiate their action
1
I've been to the mandarin gallery outlet before for brunch and was quite happy about it, so this time I went with 2 friends for hi tea in the Plaza Sing outlet. Last time going for sure.Staff was rude from our call to book a table. Arriving there, hi tea is only served for 2 people, no individual set. So we were two, we had to order for 4 people (2 sets). It took really long to get the food and even longer for the tea, so we had to wait for about 20 minutes or more. We were surprised with the amount of food, surely not enough for a hi tea, so the food meant for 4 people could barely feed 3. The staff never gave any explanation of what was what in the food. When I asked for more hot water for my tea, I was told that they cannot refill it (!!!!), that means I cannot have hot water!!! Because the type of tea I chose, I cannot have more hot water. Lousy!!! And they did not say that when I order it. Naturally in a hi tea you can have free flow of hot water, but it seems not here. Anyway the food was bad, a toast sandwich with something that seems like foie gras had such a small bit of the spread that it was basically pure toast bread. Only decent thing was the smoked salmon and the chocolate truffle. Setting is nice, but staff was very rude, and food was so average not worth even 10$. Do not go there for hi tea!Not recommended, never going back
4
Nice little place for a rest. Air con a bit strong but good indoor temp. Ginger biscuits were a bit stale an soft but the tea was pretty good. I got the ginger spicy tea but it was almost too watered down. Too much ice. Nice service and kind server. No pressure to order more than a cup of tea. Actually comes in a small glass pitcher.
5
I love discovering these hidden gems. Who would have thought a random walk around Plaza Singapura in Dhoby Gaut would land us up in (what is now) my favourite tea place. Arteastiq is a chic little cafe/restaurant with a wondrous selection of teas and coffees. The perfect place to go with friends for gossip catch up or to sit and relax with a book. I recommend you sit by the couches near the window. I have always gone on a weekday, so I have never had to wait for these seats. But if you are considering an early Saturday brunch I recommend booking. It is worth taking your art loving friends with you. There is a small art studio attached to the cafe, so let them enjoy the diverse colours, whilst you enjoy the teas
2
Having lunch with friends. Choose their lunch set menu . For this price , I will go to other restaurant. I will not go back again . The big breakfast taste below the average, the dessert is not wort if money , the coffee don't have strong coffee smell the short rib taste better but not worth that $
3
Past 3 visits to PS Arteastiq were disappointing. Food has always been so-so but in the beginning at least the tea was the main draw. Now the tea has become blander and the teapot has less water inside than before. Today my pot was only half-full and barely touched the teabag inside. Think I will go there less often now
