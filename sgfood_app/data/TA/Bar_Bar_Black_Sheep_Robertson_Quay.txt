Right next to our hotel, had a cracking curry there first night in, nice relaxed vibe on the river front, busy with no hassle.
1
Visiting in Singapore and our hotel was in neighborhood- don’t waste your time or money- service was terrible and the drinks we had were very watered down-
5
Our last meal before we took off to the airport turned out to be just perfect. We ordered a combination of Thai & Italian; it was just right & serious value for money. Also a surprise discount to hotel guests staying along the waterfront.
5
We stayed at Four Points across the river and came across this bar and were so happy we did, the idea of three kitchens / cuisines (Thai, Indian & Western) in one was fantastic! Great food, great service and reasonable prices!

If you are at Robertson Quay give this a wide berth. Our waiter was very rude and not at all helpful. He must have been having a bad day and forgot his manners. Not impressed with him at all. The food was pretty awful. We had fish and chips, which was overpriced and poor quality. The natchos were so spicey they were impossible to eat, the whitebait we sent back as there was nothing in them. The calamari was OK but a small portion. Not our best experience of Singapore. Walk on by and go to one of the other eateries who deserve your business. They also say produce your hotel card for discount... then they tell you it is only until 6.30pm
4
On a leisurely stroll down the quay, you'll find this great bar overlooking the water. We only came for the drinks, very strong cocktails and reasonably cheap for Singapore. There are little food stalls inside which open at night which would be great to try, Indian and Thai. Fantastic atmosphere
4
I rarely eat chicken or meat for that matter but when my friend introduced me to his 'favorite' on their old menu: chicken korma with jirra rice and garlic naan, it's then I realized Ive been missing all my life! It was soo good! It's not on their menu anymore but you can ask the chef to cook for you.Staffs can be a bit blur and unattentive. But overall okay
1
We went here based on reviews from trip advisor and the fact that it was within walking distance from our hotel. We started by ordering drinks since it had a full bar. Big mistake. The drinks we expensive and tasted watered down. We were going to eat dinner here but decided not to after our drinks. The waiter didn’t seem to care
5
After a long flights from the UK and rather jaded too we set out to do a little walk and found the Ba Ba Black Sheep Cafe, we had already eaten however found this cafe come bar and it was packed out so we sat at the bar and had a drink and coffee, they serve black beer hence the bars name on the pump made in Singapore called Ashai Black beer, Guinness it is not however it's lighter than Guinness to drink and very refreshing.We shall go to eat today as the good is quality and reasonably priced too.Judging with the amount of people eating yesterday it looks as though it must be good to eat there so we will.It's a a quiet area of Singapore however there are plenty of eating places around this cafe bar too.Worth a note there is no loud music no loud people and just sounds of people eating chatting and have a glass of nice wine too.Singapore = Fantastic Place to be with very friendly people in it !
5
We had a bite to eat at Bar Bar Black Sheep as were staying next door at M Social. It has a number of different "kitchens" in one place so you can order off of a number of different menus.We just had a pizza & some nachos as it was a pre-flight bite to eat and the food was tasty & good value.Washed down with some Tiger beer was great :-
4
Good beer and wine selection, very good food choices - several different cuisine in one place! And a discount off food for local hotels. Quick attentive staff every time I visit.
4
We stayed nearby and walking past opted to have a snack and drink. Food was very good with lots of variety. Some nice spicy chicken wings and a great mushroom burger. Staff were friendly. Overall a great place to grab a feed and drink
4
We were only there for a quick meal/drink(only one night in the city) but great choice and good value for money right on the quay. There was a nice atmosphere and service was good
4
Ate here every day we were there, they served thai, indian pizza, English, good selection and good price.
4
Visited with my colleagues, from Oz and Germany, after a long day to grab quick drinks and food. We were surprised to find this place serves Indian - not suggestive per the name :)We ordered chicken tikka and non veg platter along with beverages. Both were cooked well with just enough spices. The portion size is sufficient for 2 and if you are hungry you might just want a little more to feel at bliss. We further ordered main course that consisted of 2 garlic naan, chicken butter masala and mutton biryani. Lip smacking food! The downside - service was not quick enough for our liking.

I remember the first Bar Bar Black Sheep on Bukit Timah Road. Same concept with three kitchens for Indian, Thai and Western with a seperate barThe concept was cash and you paid at each as you purchased. Make it differentNow you can pay by card and table seating to order. Lost the concept and prices have double
4
They have 3 different kitchens in the restaurant. Thai, Indian and Western. We tried the Thai with about 10 dishes. Red curry, fried fish, black pepper beef, long beans, pineapple rice and some more. For beer they have glasses to towers. Tastes were good. Dishes quite small. Location is by the Singapore river. If is more of a bar than a restaurant
3
This is a busy, lively bar with most of the seating outside. It has a good selection of craft beers as well as the usual wide array of bar drinks. Prices are inclusive of GST and service so what you see is what you pay. This means that drinks work out a bit cheaper and there is no happy hour. This bar serves a wide range of food that was popular and looked good. When you want to pay, head for the bar, your waiter does not bring the bill to you
3
We were a party of five people to have initially a few drinks on the terrace of this restaurant located on Robertson quay. We decided to take dinner but inside as the table was a little small.The restaurant is composed out of three cuisines, western, Indian and Thai.It took a while before our orders had been taken, chicken masala, chicken vindaloo, fish curry, rogan josh and green curry accompanied with white rice , naan bread and some broccoli.First the green curry was served. We had to wait 45 min before the remaining dishes were served!!! Unacceptable despite the food was delicious. After several complaints we received a free jug of tiger beer.Service skills needs to be improved
1
Atmosphire is nice but all the rest is way way below avarage. Friendly staff but they have no idea what they're doing. Small dishes, overcooked burger and the lamest chicken salad on the planet earth. Prices are friendly but make no mistake, u get what u paid for and much les
5
Absolutely brilliant! Three totally different menus. Indian thai and platters. Each one lovely, the Indian food was delicious, platters were lovely, steak was to die for. The Thai I didnt like but that was me not them! 4*
5
I went this place for simple and quite lunch but surprisingly the dessert I had was one of the best I have had. certainly recommend this place
5
Went here the first night and liked it so much we went back the second night, great ambience, food, drink and service, good value only 2 minutes walk from Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, we'll be back
4
Busy, small bar that does both dine in and take away. We sat inside as there were no available outdoor tables that weren't high stools. Really enjoyed our Rogan Josh and rice and vegetable dishes. Service very good. Great music. Good vibe.
4
Good place to hang out and watch people passing by. Service is friendly and efficient. Food is OK. I ordered the Saag Chicken and Moong Dhal, it was good enough, but could have been more spicy.
4
Nice mix of cuisines here. Indian and Thai and a hint of American thrown in for good measure.Thai is honest, quick and easy.Tasty simple good food.All I want for a quick meal without much cerimony.Service is a bit on the slow side but eventually you get what you want.Prices are fair. Will go back for sure.
4
I have never been a great fan of Indian food as I felt it all tasted the same. My views changed after eating at Bar Bar. I asked the waiter, Raj, to select my meal and it was delicious. I had butter chicken, chicken tikka, garlic naan bread (best ever) and basmati rice. My wife had char grilled chix chop which she said was so tasty. Drinks a little pricey but even so the bill only came to $77. Great venue on the riverside and even the breakfast menu looked good
4
If you don't mind your starter and main course coming out at the same time (we didn't) then the food served in this establishment is first class. The other benefit is not having to think about tax and service charges. We tipped our waiter directly because of the excellent service received.
4
Have just left the place. Our order arrived very quickly.The waiter we ordered brought us a beer from a fruit. When we have told to one of the waitors he brought us a normal small beer on the house.Food quality: very goodPrice: for Singapore is cheap!!!Location: easy to approachRecommended!!
3
I came in around lunch time as I had business in the area. I was surprised only the Western food shop was open. I was not impressed by the food. The service was odd, you need to go to the bar for everything. I think it would be nice for an evening drink, but lunch time I would not return
4
This is a combination of North Indian, Thai, and Western cuisines, all are cooed in separate kitchens and all were tasty and cheap, bar prices seemed cheap.
Very popular with expats as well as tourists
3
There was nothing that stood out about the food at this place. I was really wanting some amazing pad Thai and it was just okay. One thing to come here for is the patio and the local brewed beer.
5
This place is a gem! Great food, cool speedy service, great casual atmosphere. I have been here time and time again alone, with friends, on business... The standard has always been outstanding. Highly recommended.
5
Lovely food - you must try any of the Biryanis (chicken, mutton, fish) or kebabs or a nice Singapore Sling. There is a wide choice of food
4
Combining 3 different outlets under one roof,great idea. I presume that is what keeps it such good value. Thai,Indian and Western fare. All good,great location,very popular,and I am not surprised. Large groups or Couples,are equally welcome
4
Food was great! concept of having 3 cuisines food (Indian, Thai and Western) at one place is an interesting idea and concept. Staffs not very friendly though. Overall not a bad place for food and drinks.
4
A trendy little bar. Great location on the river for a relaxing drink.
There's a fair bit of food options but didn't eat but would definitely consider returning for.
1
How on earth would someone know you don't have enough food to serve your regular customers at 10:00PM. You travel all the way thinking that your family can have good food but what you get is we don't have any more food. Start keeping enough stocks to feed your customers or else change your timings until 9:00 PM so people stop visiting you. Very Very Disappointe
4
An unpretentious bar/eatery in a very pleasant location on the riverside and a good place for a relaxing evening beer and/or meal sitting outside watching the world go by. Having said that, if it is wet then very few of the outside tables have sufficient cover to use, and inside the seating is limited and fairly basic (and with three kitchens on the go, it can also get hot!)It should satisfy all tastes because, as you will know (because it’s repeated in virtually every previous review) it offers three types of food menu – Indian, Thai and Western – produced in three separate kitchens. I believe these are individually managed although there is a central payment system (i.e. you can order dishes from the Indian, Thai and Western menu and they will be all on one bill). It is popular and invariably crowded.Although we visit this restaurant regularly when visiting Singapore I have not eaten from the Western food menu, but a couple of meals from the Thai menu have been fine. However, we find the Indian food the best and eat mainly from this menu. It is all reasonably priced (to give you some examples as benchmarks, Aloo Gobi S$7.50; Chicken Jalfraizi with mixed vegetables S$14.50, Basmati Rice S$2.50, plain Nan S$2.50) and no service charge or tax is added, although like most places in Singapore beer is relatively expensive (pint of Asahi S$13, Carlsburg S$12), usually making the cost of the beer more than the meal itself! Curiously they do not stock the local Tiger beer, nor do they have a ‘happy hour’ as many bars do
5
They have a concept really good a mix Thai restaurant with other with western food and a third restaurant Indian and separated a bar . So u can order from 3 restaurants and the bar without move .. kebab Indian food naan bread calamari spice prawns cold beer all my favorites.. also nice and fast staff to make sure you happy client. Plus no gst or any other plus plus in the bill. You should go .
1
Awful. I ordered the butter chicken (Deliveroo) and the chicken was not eatable, looking and tasting like offal !!!!
Vraiment horrible le butter chicken, que des morceaux pourris du poulet, sans le goût du poulet, type abats, ignoble !
5
Great all day restaurant. Food and service exceptional. Lovely setting by the river and back of Hotels.
All European food with some Chinese fusion.
5
They have interesting menu as each page is dedicated to different cuisine. I took green mango salad and sweet and sour chicken from Thai page.
Local beer was good.
4
Selection of food ethnicity's all at reasonable prices, well cooked and good service. Selection of Beers too.
3
Been there a couple times and the level of service variate depending on the staff. Great place for drinks and they serve food from a big menu! Great happy hour offers.
5
This was opposite our hotel and every night it was packed. Based on that we decided to eat there. It was really good both Asian and western and good value for money.highly recommend
4
At the end of Robertson Quay. One of three \four on the island
Menu has good choices of Indian, Thai and Western! Food is good and more choice of drinks than previously
Location is quiet and made to look tree lined which works
4
Have been here several times and I like that there are choices from three restauarnts at one venue. Thai, Indian and western foods can be ordered on the same bill as well as drinks. This is located on the banks of the Singapore River at Robertson Quay and has a relaxing atmosphere when eating. .Our group ordered several dishes from each of the restaurants and everyone enjoyed their choices. The Indian food was good and I enjoyed the Thai food. The staff can be a bit obnoxious at times but that was not going to deter us from the delicious food. The drinks menu is very good and the prices are reasonable. The food portions were good and flavoursome. Will still go back to enjoy the food
5
We called in for a drink as this was near our hotel and ended up staying all evening. The curry was the best for many years and the service was excellent. No service charge and no tax. The price you saw on the menu was what you paid
3
I am visiting Singapore on a business trip and found this place while looking for a decent restaurant nearby my hotel. I chose this than others due to its attractive name. I ordered a Veg Thai food (Green Thai Curry). Amazing food! Thoroughly enjoyed and will recommend this to anyone who is a veg and want to have a good meal. I also ordered Asahi Black Beer which was also great.However, I did not find the person with whom I interacted initially as a pleasant person. Normally, you expect waiter/staff to explain you things with respect but obviously he is from a different world, Or may be he was having a bad day. Nevertheless, I will still recommend this place to others for a good food
5
Even though there's lots to choose from - Indian, Thai and Western, the taste and quality of the food was great. Service was good considering how full the place was. Perfect location for a walk down Robertson Quay.
5
I had the local burger here, very worthwhile and the price was reasonable. Popular with travellers and locals.
Full house of people here.
4
Situated along the riverfront, this delightful restaurant offers a variety of cuisines to suit all tastes. Prices are very reasonable, service was friendly and efficient and the food tasty. All round a lovely evening was had here.
5
Hanging out for a decent flat white without that dreadful evaporated milk!? A great place for burger type food and very good coffee. Prices not too bad either for Singapore (where your money just melts).
1
Service is not good and food was mediocre to disappointing. Can't get tap water, must pay $2.8 for a small bottle of water. Never again.
5
Bar Bar Black Sheep is fun because the menu has Thai, Indian, and Western dishes, as well as TAPAS! Our group of five order three mains, the sambal kang kong (vegetables) and two tapas--the need bruschetta and wasabi prawn. Everything was delicious and satisfying. Make reservations early or gamble on getting one of the open tables
4
We had lunch here while staying at M Social. A great location on the river. Food was good, we opted for the Asian menu but there were three different menu choices, Indian, Asian or western and all looked reasonable. Staff were friendly and helpful and food was tasty and came out quickly. Drinks were reasonably priced but we had to pay for water. All in all a good place for a quick bite to eat at a reasonable price
5
I stopped by Bar Bar Black Sheep as I was looking for something for lunch. The menu caught my eye as it has a bit of everything. And the prices were reasonable for Singapore. Didn't hurt that showing my card key from the hotel gave a 10% discount, as well. I had the Pad Thai with seafood and it was very good. Coupled with a pint of Carlsberg and lunch was just what I needed
4
The place is nice and cozy. NO GST and SERVICE CHARGE, are you still complaining about the service?We have Chesse Nam and chicken Tendori, with the vege. The taste is really nice.The fried mushroom is quite good only the sauce is not match with it
1
Went with family... The food was below average ..I ordered the Mutton Rogangosh ...it had so much red color in it..I could wash it off my hands with soap for 2 days!!.. and it was really bad..just lots of red sauce with boiled lamb!!The well done & rear steak were both the same & really thin and not juicy...A joke for a steak actually..I think its hawker food..in a nice location...the smoothie was bland & had less fruit!!Never again
4
The food was very nice - we went twice so it must have been - but I could have eaten more. Price was reasonable for Singapore (maybe that explains the portion size!) Service could be a little slow.
5
Great food with great prices. Has a varied menu so sure to get something you like to eat. Has a great range of boutique or craft beers - a pleasant surprise.
4
It is pleasure time spent there. If You want to have a time with friends - go to this bar. You will enjoy food and drinks near the river. You will spent resonable amount of money and receive good memmories.
4
We walked along the river front and came across this restaurant and decided to try it out. We weren't disappointed, steak was nice and tender and the potatoes and salad were nice. Service was friendly. Well priced for what we got.
3
Like all the joints on this strip, expect to pay a premium for eating/drinking along the quay.Since I was here for 2 weeks, I managed to swill my way though each of them. I liked Verra the most on this little strip of maybe 8 proprietors, but not a great difference amongst them.Quay prices - highQuay quality - mehQuay service - mostly goodQuay itself - a nice respite from the hustle bustle that is all of Singapore.I balanced my regimen by alternating between these joints on the quay, and the food hawker center next to the great city shopping center.A meal along the quay? Easily $20++ - double that if you add a few adult beverages.A meal at the hawker center? $3 or so. And there's beer available, so, yup, add some adult beverages and your meal doubles to $6.So, for patronizing dishes but really nice ambiance - the quay.For cheap, filling, and authentic dining at next to nothing prices - the hawkers
1
It was a very nicely located restaurant along the river. But they were rude. We went there n waited for them to give the menu but it didn't happen. Then we asked for the menu then also he didn't give us nor was he ready to take the order. They gave menu to people came after us. Ultimately we walked out without having anything they didn't even bother. Very sad.....
4
Huge tropical rain storm hit whilst out on a walk. Stopped in here for a beer and Pad Thai to wait until it passed. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. Only issue is it doesn't have free wifi but they allowed me to use the business connection, well done team
4
I happen to chance upon this shop when I was staying at M Social hotel.Bar Bar Black Sheep offers a discount for guest staying in nearby hotel during the weekday lunch hour.The food there are amazing with many choices from Western to Thai and not forgetting their alcohols
4
My husband and I go to this restaurant all the time, and we love it because of its location so that our dog can run around and play with passing dogs while we eat.The service is great when the two experienced guys are there. They don't ever get the order wrong, and they are very quick and savvy.We also loved it because it is decently priced, but recently we found that the portion sizes have shrunk, and the cost has increased on the Indian food menu. We are very disappointed by this, and hard to back as often as we used to.
4
Visited for a night dinner with friend, location is good and tried Indian food garlic bread and vegetable biryani ,the food was very good as per the taste buds of an Indian . Less crowded and fast service . U fortunately they don't serve Indian food on Tuesda
4
Lively Riverfront restaurant offering outside casual dining and a menu that includes Thai, Indian and Western food. Fun and friendly staff, a great drinks menu and free wifi.
5
Nice and quiet place. Good food especially for Vegetarians. Reasonably priced menu for food and drinks.
2
14 sgd for a pint in this place is way too expensive. Food is great good variety. But drinks could be cheaper. It's not an high end place.
4
Came here for a few beers with an international visitor earlier in the week. There's a decent selection of beers available at not unreasonable prices. Good atmosphere, friendly service and a pleasant location along the river. Worth another visit.
5
Stopped by for an early dinner before heading over to the airport. I had the Thai seafood rice. It was nicely done and the portion was quite good. The service was friendly and the ambience outside was nice facing the river.
4
Good local resturant, with reasonable prices for food and drink; and I think the best garlic naarn I have ever had!Only the indian and Thai kitchens open, no European, which was ok with us; my Butter chicken was very good, the Thai food came about 8 minutes later and was Ok but not outstanding. The dark tap beer was very good
4
We visited this place 3 times. On the 1st visit thai kitchen was closed & next day was Indian kitchen.We enjoyed the food very much. Especially indian food.We spend the least $$ here but at the end of the dinner we left the place with satisfaction & full stomach.It is nicer to share your food as you can try more dishes. The restaurant don't charge gst & service charge. However, you can leave some tips if u happy with the food or service, or both. If you are in a hurry, this may not be the best place for you to eat. I saw some patron bringing dog along. The place is a bit crowded, in my opinion, if you would like to bring your pet, please take care of it for convenience of other patrons.
1
Have been to Bar Bar a few times and I like the formulae. Very inconsistent service though. Tonight will be my last attempt to eat at Bar Bar. Having been shown to a table I was given Menu to browse. After waiting for 20 minutes looking for someone to give my order to I gave up and left. I couldn't even tell anyone why I was leaving as there wasn't anyone!Luckily the area is good with plenty of other good (and cheaper) options
3
As the location was close to our hotel, we decided to order lunch, (as this was the least busiest restaurant). Honestly I didn't enjoy my Indian food, and wouldn't return. Hubby did enjoy his food (as he said he was hungry) he had wings and he enjoyed his beer. The location is nice, with a pretty view. The server was nonchalant.We visited February 2015
5
We went here as they serve Thai food too! We loved it and went again. They also serve Indian food and American food. The location is peaceful on the river side! The localities come here for walking as well.. the food is pretty reasonable and quantity is good too.
4
In a nice setting along the river that serves great food. Set under the shady trees away from the hot sun. Great choice of food and wine or beer, good service with a friendly face.
4
Nice and not too populated compare to Clarke Quay. A good place to chill and relax. Few meters away from the river and seems a really nice view...
3
Pleasant eatery and bar at Robertson Quay
Wide range is Asian meals available at reasonable prices
Pleasant staff, however battle with large patronage and slow to provide service
5
I had lunch at this casual place at Robertson Quay and was disappointed that I could not go back for dinner. It is a short walk from the local hotels with a large outside patio along the river. They have several beers on tap and some nice wines by the glass (and an excellent coffee bar). They cater the food from outside suppliers but it seems to work. I did not try any of the western dishes or the Thai menu (lots of interesting choices) but went with the Indian. The mutton vindaloo was perfect with just the right burn. The pilau was the way I like it with lots of fruit. The plain Naan was fantastic. I did not have room to try the Tikka but I saw it was a favorite with other diners. It is a very casual place and the service matches but I found the service very efficient and friendly. It was also the least expensive meal I had all week. Next trip I will go back for dinner.
4
If you are taking a walk on the river, this is a great place for a casual evening with excellent Indian and Thai food. Since it is a bit of a walk from the hotels, the primary audience are the people living in the surrounding condos, so it's a good escape from the tourist crowd.
4
Great experience here one tip order your meal when your ready to eat as it comes mega quick .The curries are really authentic beers are great to and at a good price for Singapore I always make for bar bar black sheep when in in Singapore I stay in the riverview so it's just over the bridge.
4
Just got back from Bar Bar Black Sheep. Great casual dining with choice of cuisines. We feasted on a range of Indian dishes, along with a couple of beers. Food was really delicious, and such fun to watch people going by. This place is really popular too. We got a table straight away but while we ate we watched a few groups standing around and waiting for a free table - even though there are plenty of other venues nearby. I'd say it's worth the wait
4
They offer Indian, Thai and Occidental food. I ordered butter chicken and garlic naan and I have to say that both were really tasty. The cocktails were also good, Singapore sling was top! The best part is the price, as compared to other restaurants in the same area this can be considered as a cheap one
4
I wanted to visit this restaurant after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor whilst we were visiting Singapore. It was a little hard to find, however after asking a couple of people along the way we managed to find it. The restaurant is small but has a very nice outdoor seating covered area which makes for a pleasant setting. It was raining the afternoon we were there however we still stayed outside which was fine. We were only interested in the Thai food, the menu had a good range to select from. I had a curry with rice and my wife a vegetarian stir fry fry both very tasty along with a beer and a glass of wine. Its not a fancy restaurant by any means but its a great little restaurant and I'm glad we made the effort to find. Just check your bill as I was charged for 2 beers and I only had 1 alcohol is dear enough in Singapore without paying what you haven't had. An apology from the young man which was fine, all in all a pleasant experience
4
There are several choices of national foods and a good bar within the building. The table and chairs outside are peaceful over looking the Singapore River. Close to several hotels and Havelock Road. Food choices like Thai, Indian and European foods are tasty. Great choices of drinks from the bar
3
One of the many entertainment right behind Riverview Hotel. Service is average, food is good. Nice view and deco.
3
Food was good but not quite as we expected it. Service was quick and polite but difficult to understand their explanation of the menu. The Indian food good. Location is great along the river.
4
I've only tried the Indian food, generally a curry and naan - always tasty. Great location for people watching. I would recommend expanding the selection of bottled beers, would be ideal if you had a few good IPAs on tap. Cooper's is not it for me
4
The place proved a bit difficult for our taxi driver to find but it was worth the search. We had the butter chicken with rice and plain bread; it was plenty for 2 people. Include a couple of drinks and the bill came to approx. $48 SGD. We enjoyed the casual atmosphere and had a good time. Worth the effort and I'm happy to recommend this eatery
5
There are 3 kitchens here producing western, Thai and north Indian food. The tandoori food was excellent - really tasty chicken tikka and sheesh kebab. Beer isn't great but they do good cocktails too. Good tip is to have your aperitif and night cap at the Quay Bar 2 doors away where the wine is good value
5
We tried this restaurant on recommendation of our friends who had travelled to Singapore few months back.The location is very nice near at Robet Quay in front of river. They ave both outdoor and indoor seating. Very casual ambience where you could drink for hours. Indian food was very nice, and it felt like water in desert for our Indian family. We tried butter chicken, dal makhani and paneer makhani along with nans. All items were very nice, even better than most places in Bangalore, India. Also, the prices were very reasonable unlike other eateries in Singapore. Highly recommended
4
After a day sightseeing, we wandered from our hotel opposite, to the riverfront restaurants. After walking past all of them in this area, near Robertson Quay, we settled on Bar Bar Black Sheep - cute name too! We were served quickly and there were a number of patrons enjoying their meal on a balmy night. We had sugh chicken in spinach puree, chicken masala, naan bread and safron rice with spices, plus drinks, for S$51.50. The food was very good. The tables were very casual and the service was OK too. It was a nice spot to sit, eat and watch the passing parade of people walking along the river. Very casual
5
Went here on a pleasant Saturday evening and it was a nice experience. Service is a bit slow since its understaffed, but if you are not in a hurry its ok as the staff are nice.From the Thai selection, I had the Tamarind Prawns - very nicely done dish with large, peeled and butterflied prawns. My wife had the ribeye steak which was nicely done. With a wine, beer and chicken wings appetizer, it came to S$71 which is not too bad considering the quality of the food
3
The food here is good, with the Thai and Indian both good quality and the location is convenient. Unfortunately on both occasions visited, the service has been exceptionally slow. Both times the food has been ready but the place seems understaffed so food has sat waiting to be delivered to the table. Drinks arrived when we had finished food
3
This restaurant overlooks the river and has an outdoor seating area. We had a tasty Tai meal. The Thai fish cakes were particularly good. It is opposite the Riverview Hotel and makes a good place to eat if you do not want to dine in the hotel, but do not want to walk too far
3
This outlet serves Western, Thai and Indian food. I found the Pad Thai a bit soggy and too sweet for my taste. The seating is not very comfortable - mostly high stools. Fair selection of beers available.
4
Wonderful place to dine with views of the Singapore River. We just watch the wold go by. People pushing prams, children riding scooters, walking dogs and jogging.
5
We were just strolling down the river and stopped in for a bite to eat, my wife had the Butter chicken and i had the special burger, the food was awesome, will visit again.
5
We found this place by chance and were not disappointed. Great selection of beverages and 3 different food kitchens to choose from - Western, Thai and Indian. No ++ on the prices, so you can choose your tip. Lovely place.
5
This is by far the cheapest of the restaurants along this river front strip. We felt a bit bad as a note on the table said wait staff get paid through drink sales and I don't drink alcohol and my wife and I are both on health kicks so are trying to not drink our calories!. We still bought 2 still waters so hopefully they got paid something!Service was good, location was nice.We ordered from the Indian section, the bar has a few different cuisine menus.The curry I had was the best curry I have ever eaten hands down. It was a beautiful flavour and just the right serving size. From memory it was $12 for the curry and $2 for the rice and Naan. Can't remember the name but it was a cashew nut based one.Appeared to be a popular spot with expats out for a drink

We stumbled upon this little bar/restaurant after waking up really late & finding out there were very few places still serving food. The place is right by the river, has an outside terrace and a nice wine menÃº. The food is tasty and small, pefect for a snack, we had some stuffed mushrooms and a tiny pizza, delicious! Not for the budget traveller, but for us it was definitely worth the price, good location good service and great wine

Bar Bar Black Sheep is situated on Robertson Quay and has a laid back coffee house feel. That, however, is the only good thing that I can say about this place. The Cafe sports multiple menus across several genres, including Northern Indian, Thai and Western. I ordered Indian food and it was terrible. I am a lover of Indian food at all levels and price points - from the white table cloth variety to the "Brick Lane" or street food variety. The indian (Chicken Vindaloo) was just terrible. Even the naan bread was poor. I did not even finish my meal. Thankfully, The Curry Culture is just around the corner. I can see how the menu would have some allure to a group that couldn't agree on what type of cuisine to dine on for lunch or dinner, but based on the exposure to the Indian food at Bar Bar Black Sheep I fear all will go home unsatisfied

We have been there 9 mouths ago. We ordered 2 pizzas and both were great with good price and quality Service was good and stuff were super friendly This restaurant not only has a great menu but also a great view of river U do enjoy it 
2
Nice place to go to, their north indian food is delicious and their bar bar black sheep cocktail is delicious. HOWEVER, their staff service is extremely bad. It is to the extent that they are ignoring you at times. Thank god their manager is good at what she is doing and saaves the da

Sat down with ten colleagues wildly mixed from native Chinese, Chinese Singaporean, Singaporean, Indian, Western and could indeed without much problems find food and drinks for everyone, thanks to the Thai, Indian and Western cuisine. Thai though was closed for the day. Would recommend it for quiet, calm business dinner. Lamb chop had strong taste from the sauce, but luckily sauce was delicious. Fresh Kronenbourg made it a round, nice, affordable dinner. Recommend
4
Nice and relaxing place. After a long day it's just nice to sit, enjoy a beer and great Indian food. The western I have not tried, for Thai there are better places.
4
Food was lovely and quick service. Very reasonably priced and close to the hotel. I felt safe walking here.
4
Hadn't expected to eat Indian on our first night in Singapore but the location on the waterside of Robertson Quay was so inviting and the atmosphere fun we thought we would try it. Great food and good attentive service.
4
Lovely setting by the river, this bar/restaurant serves Western, Indian and Thai food. My wife says the Thai food.was good. The western is OK. Reasonable prices for food and beer. it was always our first stop for wither a beer or some food.
4
Good service, friendly staff and 3 restaurant menus to pick from - makes for a three-in-one restaurant for different taste buds!
5
This is great restaurant on river front at Robertson Quay. This is good place to relax after day's work and chill out with glass of beer. They serve good and tasty Indian food with very reasonable price as well as Thai and western. Quick service and attentive staff. Liquor is bit expensive, but so in any restaurant. One can not add tip on credit card. Staff makes their earning from cash tips and drinks one takes. They are not paid. Novel idea to keep staff on toes

We had dinner at Bar Bar Black Sheep on a recent visit to Singapore. As we had seen some good review about the place we decided to check it out. Walked up from Clarke Quay which took about 15min. We all went for one of the Indian dishes. The food was really tasty and well priced for Singapore standards. Friendly and attentive staff when we went there. Would recommend to check out the place if you are around the area
4
I stay nearby when I am in Singapore and do tend to gravitate here for dinner, as Bar Bar Black Sheep sort of contains 3 different restaurants within the one location - Thai, Indian, and Western. So there is plenty of choices available. Food is pretty decent, though I tend to stick with the Thai and Indian options, though the Western food is on par with any mid range pub in Australia (probably given the large number of expats in the area). Service varies but is friendly, and it's a nice spot to sit outside by the river
4
Had two meals here during recent stay, the menu met three generations expectations, mother, daughter and 13 year old all loved it so much we went twice, the vibe is great only comment it was so busy at 9 pm meals took a while to come otherwise great venue in the busy, humid Singapore, the rivers edge had many options for dining but this had the best value for money, thanks we all enjoyed it
3
ok so I'm an impatient American but seemed like drinks/etc. were very slow. We all ordered together, two meals came out first, and we were almost finished before the second two came out. Drinks were a bit slow to flow as well. I had Pad Thai and it was ok, not very spicy for sure. Others didn't complain about their food quality. Will probably not be back....
5
Have eaten here several times. The atmosphere is great just by the river. There is plenty of variety to choose from on the menu and the prices are not too bad. Definitely a favourite in Singapore!
5
love their indain food. definitely have the sesame naan with palak paneer and the rogan josh is yummy. the butter chicken is great too. the white wine the house wine is delicious and they serve it chilled. not impressed with their thai or western food.
5
Comfort food at a good price. Pasta, curry, and European food, alongside Singaporean favourites. Lovely place.
4
Value for money food here, no service charge or GST, don't skimp though, buy a drink or two and enjoy.
4
Tried Indian vegetarian food. It was authentic, tasty and good value for money. Other options also avaiable.
5
Great food and drink, we ate here most nights for dinner as close to the hotel just had took walk across the bridge and you were there. So convenient and fun. They were so caring and attentive prices were so reasonable. Also had an amazing choice of other restaurants, Italian, Thai, Indian, Japanese etc
4
This place has a great choice of food with different menus, serving different food from different kitchens but in the one restaurant so we were able to have a choice of Indian, Chinese/Thai and traditional pasta type dishes all in the same place. The food was great, curry some of the best we've had outside the curry capital of The UK! It was very busy and we ended up ordering at the bar rather than waiting for waiter service but there is a note to advise of this.
2
This is about the Holland Village branch. They don't serve tap water, which is the first sign of a stingy place.Second, when I leaned on their table it tipped over and smashed my wine glass. The broken glass went in my salad. They replaced the salad but not the wine and then tried to charge me for the wine. I protested that it broke because their table was unstable. The waitress lectured me that she would take the wine charge off the bill, but that it was not the correct thing to do, and that she was already doing me a favor by replacing the salad.To be fair, the chicken tikka masala was very tasty
4
Located near Singapore River, back side of King’s Center, this bar/restaurant provides a right setup for a right evening. Though named as bar but this outlet has three-four different kitchens serving different cuisines, i.e. Indian, Thai, Western etc. I tried the Indian cuisine and my order was for dal makhani, bindi masala, nan and veg biryani. They did not take much time to get dishes ready. The serving size was adequate enough for 2 people. The taste was fine, specially dal makhani. Prices are very reasonable. The only thing is that you should order a drink as the servers’ salary is somehow dependent of the drink order. It is written on their menu so we ordered soft drinks. Good thing was that this restaurant does not charge any service charge or GST, so you pay what you see on menu. As a courtesy, as there is no service charge on the bill, you should provide tips. Overall, I was very much satisfied with the setting, ambiance, menu and service. I would recommend that if you are in the nearby area then do try out this bar/restaurant
3
Went for lunch around 2:00 pm with a couple friends. We had the place to ourselves on a Friday afternoon. We seated ourselves and waited and waited. I noticed a sign that was visible from our table which informed customers that "self service is encouraged" and went on to say that we could feel free to grab our own menus as they can "get busy from time to time." But since there were no other customers around, I didn't think the staff would have a problem assisting us. However after not wanting to continue waiting, one of my friends went inside and got our drinks and got our menus. When she ordered and paid for our drinks, the guy behind the bar said he'd come out to get our orders but never did so we each went inside and ordered our food. Thankfully he did deliver our food to the table so that was much appreciated
4
They operate on an interesting system, where 3 kinds of cuisine serves a customer at one time. You'll enjoy Thai, Indian, and western. Not just the system, food was great, although we didn't try Indian one.
4
A great selection of food and beers at very reasonable prices. Choice of western, indian and thai food avaliable
4
This place is a few minutes walk from my apartment. They have three food outlets within the bar. Indian, Thai and Western. The seating capacity is limited but there is no service charge. It is directly across from the River View Hotel on Singapore River.
5
We have eaten here before and just love their curries. Portions are excellent and prices considering its Singapore are very fair. The taste though is just fabulous, best Indian curry in years and I remember the last one, it was here!Don't waste your time with the tourist places further along Robertson towards Clarke Quay, as you will have to go a long way to beat this cuisine. 5 for food but 4 for the restaurant itself
1
we thought the menu looked interesting, so we decided to try out this place. Big mistake. on arrival we were presented with menus.....then we waited, and waited....and waited.......we saw no further evidence of a waiter, but we read a sign saying self service encouraged!!!! one of our party went to the bar to ask for drinks and was told waiter would be with us shortly... by this time we had waited 15 mins with no service. icing on the cake....another party arrived, were seated and the waiter immediately took the order., deftly ignoring our table. at this point we left. we will not be back. baaad experience alltogether. dont go unless you are prepared to wait a very very long tim
2
Have a good menu selection and decent food. But their service is quite bad. The place wasn't even half full but they took a lot of time to deliver the food. Forgot to get 2 dishes as well. One of the friends had a bad throat and asked for warm water but they said they only served mineral water which also they weren't ready to warm up! Wouldn't go there again
4
An unpretentious bar/eatery in a very pleasant location on the riverside and a good place for an evening beer and/or meal sitting outside watching the world go by (and very convenient if staying at the Grand Copthorne Hotel or Riverview Hotel on the other side of the river). It should satisfy all tastes as it has three types of food menu – Indian, Thai and Western. These are produced in three separate kitchens, which I believe are individually managed although there is a central payment system (i.e. you can order dishes from the Indian, Thai and Western menu and they will be all on one bill). I have not eaten from the Western food menu, but one meal from the Thai menu was fine. However, we found the Indian food the best and ate mainly from this menu. It is all reasonably priced, and no service charge is added, although like most places in Singapore beer is relatively expensive at S$11 or $12 (£5.50-£6) a pint (the cost of the beer was always more than the meal!). They do not have a ‘happy hour’ as many bars do, but the difference between this and ‘happy hour’ prices elsewhere was not that great
2
Was taken there by friends who are long time expats. One of the most average experiences I've had in a long time. The service was atrocious. They were slow and then delivered doubles of multiple orders. Admittedly we got the extra orders free but how can you stuff up that many orders ? The house wine was $12 per glass paint thinner and the grilled chicken salad was ...well...Not even average. Lovely riverside location. That's about it
2
Other than the atmosphere and cold beer, it's hard to say anything positive. The food was almost inedible, it was so bad. The kids' chicken nuggets were like stones and my thai fish was hard to distinguish from these nuggets. They also brought me the wrong meal and when I asked about it they asked me if I would eat it anyway. Add this to the fact that the bill was close to $100, I'm not sure why anyone would go here. Spend a fraction of the cost and go to a hawker centre or if you're keen for Robertson Quay, most other places will be considerably better
4
Been here a few times over the years but decided to provide a review.Not sure how it's organised but there are 3 separate kitchens,all individually run.We had Pad Thai,Mutton Masala and cheese garlic bread.Beers include several lagers and Tetleys.Food was excellent.A beer had to be rejected as it was sour but they opened a new barrel without a problem and it was good.Would certainly return
5
We had a few drinks and a meal here. Staff were very friendly and the meal delicious,lots of lovely flavours, the nan bread was by far the best I have tasted, so good we ordered a second one. Well done 😃
4
Walked past this place and something smelled good, smelt like real Indian food should. Since I'm always wary of getting real Indian food, compared to the make believe, I hesitated , but then though the better.Gave it a go and it was a meal from India no ifs or buts... From the mutton Kebabs, to the prawn masala and the nan, washed down with a pint of beer.Would most certainly recommend this place
5
We had a curry at this restaurant. It was reasonably cheap but very good. The service isn't too bad even though you need to wait for a while. The food tasted great and it is nice to watch the water taxis lit up going by down the river
3
Located in Robertson Quay just beside the Singapore River, the natural ambience of this place is charming. The food was simply average. Tried the Indian dishes and found them a bit odd; nothing extraordinary. The mojito was better and had the refreshing fragrance.I did nt try the western and Thai stuff so wont be able to comment
5
If you want a decent Indian curry or Thai noodles, all at a reasonable price by Singapore standards then you can't beat this place. I often go there if I'm traveling solo or with colleagues. It's low key on the decor but located right next to the river with seating outside or in, so it's a pretty cool location. The service is pretty good but the servers are always rushed off their feet so go ahead and grab a table if you see one free! Because they do Indian, Thai and Western food, there's a wide selection when you can't decide what type of food you want. I usually get a curry but occasionally get Pad Thai for a change
4
This pavement bar/restaurant was packed out on a Friday night, mainly with young locals, but we managed to find a table. Service was very good, considering the crowd. The food was good value and tasty, both from the Thai menu but not particularly Thai in flavour. Would be happy to go again
1
I was so looking forward to Eggs Benedict..... However when it arrived it was two hard poached eggs with the worst bacon I have ever seen, on top of a toasted burger bun topped with hollandaise sauce out of a packet. Overall it looked and tasted like the effort of a lazy unskilled che
3
My wife & I were here for lunch.. The inside is totally run down with 2 independent kitchens right on your face replete with washing plates etc. To make this worse the auto dish washer is in the seating area !! We decided to move to the outdoor seating area. The cuisines are a bit confused with Thai + Indian + Western run independent of each other. The staff are enthusiastic but spaced out, and service takes ages. Of the 5 restaurants here this is the most 'no frills' kinda place. Due to the lower cost many youngster flock here in large groups. I would not recommend, better options are available right next door
3
Bar-Bar's location on the banks of the Singapore River is great and the crowd is much less touristy than at Clarke or Boat Quay. Clientele is still predominantly expat, service is good, but the vegetarian Indian dishes are average. What was disappointing too was their refusal to serve tap water which is completely safe in Singapore. Instead, you are forced to order bottled water adding to plastic refuse.That is the reason for a 3 rating rather than a 4
5
Situated opposite the Riverview Hotel adjacent to the river this small bistro restaurant offers exceptional value along with a vary varied menu. The staff are quick and industrious and the food is very good. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I guess that why we have eaten there many times on our visits to Singapore.
4
I reaaaaaaaally liked the Thai Spicy sauce. Sambal Prawn with Sataw was not so impressive (how come it's not on the menu!) Nice location and affordable price. Will visit again.
4
I especially like the indian food at bar bars....i have been there a number of times and have never been dissappointed....
4
Excellent food and very good prices.
Large portions, fast service and friendly helpful staff.
Have eaten there three times in past month and never disappointed
4
This little bar, serves great food from 3 different kitchens. We had Indian food, which was really tasty, prices are good for singapore.
Would recommend to everyone.
Even drinks are quite reasonably priced
5
this is a great choice on the river they have indian, thai and western style food vendors to choose from with outdoor seating
5
As others have said there is a choice of 3 types of cusine and you can mix and match them. There are Indian and Thai chefs.We shared a lovely crispy whole sea bass and it was so tasty. I ordered a naan bread beforehand to keep my hunger at bay and that was delicious- fresh from the tandoor oven.The location is great, right by the river
5
The PLUS points :The location is a perfect spot for alfresco dining and people watching. Price is relatively reasonable taking into account its setting. Staff are friendly. Vast menu from its Thai, Indian and Western kitchen.The MINUS point (yup, only one I could think of) :The Food … Food from the Thai kitchen is rather bland and far from authentic. Tasted like a very much watered down version of proper Thai food. Perhaps I am being picky by comparing it with that of the days when I lived in Thailand. Indian kitchen is only so-so.Overall, it's ok for a quick bite or maybe if you're stopping by for a thirst quencher. Very much a handy place for those of us staying in one of the many hotels across the bridge
3
We visited this place as it is almost across from our hotel at Roberson Quay. We had been out having drinks but we were looking for a small bite still to hush our stomach. We had the tempura prawns and buffalo wings here.Nice place to stay, you get what you pay for and the atmosphere is nice

I decided to eat here twice for lunch before writing this review just to ensure that my first experience wasn’t an anomaly. I decided to try this place because it was close to my hotel, had a huge variety of food on offer and appeared to be very reasonably priced for a riverside restaurant in Singapore. On Tuesday I sat down outside around 1:30 pm and there was only one other couple visible, so it was certainly not crowded. I was waited on promptly and given three menus. I tried ordering off the Indian menu but was informed that the Indian kitchen was closed for the day. I switched to the Thai menu and ordered the green curry chicken (S$9.50), steamed rice (S$2) and mineral water (S$2.90). A pleasant surprise was getting a cold bottle of water and a small glass of ice. The curry was very tasty and I thought there was a reasonable amount of chicken, though there were some pieces that I wondered what part of the chicken they came from. I can’t say whether the portion was smaller than one might get at Clarke Key, for example, but it was certainly adequate for a lunch dish. The following day I arrived about 12:30 pm and there were only four other people outside, two each at two tables, so the service was prompt, both in taking the order, delivering the food and presenting the bill. This day I had the chicken tikka masala (S$13), garlic naan (S$3), plain yogurt (S$1), plain basmati rice (S$2) and mineral water. The chicken dish had four larger pieces of chicken and maybe two much, much smaller pieces. I don’t think any of the chicken was white meat but it was tender and the sauce flavorful with a mild hotness. There was a large amount of excellent rice but the chicken dish was a little on the small side by U.S. standards, but more than adequate for lunch. The naan was very well prepared with only a slight garlic flavor. This is not a complaint but worth mentioning because I was expecting a much stronger garlic flavor. So, referring back to the title of this review, I believe that your opinion of Bar Bar Black Sheep will largely be influenced by the expectations you have on entering. If you’re expecting good, but largely average, food at very reasonable prices I believe you’ll be very happy with your choice. Not having eaten there in the evening I can’t comment on those reviews that fault this place for being short-staffed.Thank you for reading. If you’ve found this useful I’ll appreciate a Yes vote below

Having stopped for a cheeky pint earlier today we looked at the menu and decided to return later in the evening for a curry.The restaurant was busy for a Monday evening.We ordered drinks and Indian food and enjoyed the curries which were tasty and of very good value. Delicious rice and naan breads. Also no service charge or GST which makes for a cheap evening with reasonably priced drinks. Well worth a tip for the very busy staff.In a good location, away from the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay which in my opinion is over rated. Good atmosphere in a quieter area of Singapore (10 minute walk from Clarke Quay)
4
Just arrived in Singapore, not sure what meal I needed and choose this fusion restaurant by location and the fact it was busy.
Chose the Tandoori Platter, the variety of tastes on the plate were just the ticket!
Will be back!
4
A very busy little restaurant nestling on the waterfront. Despite being packed early evening, the service was good, and the waiter very helpful in helping with menu choices. Food fast, hot and delicious. Thank you for a delicious meal.
2
It's quick as all the curries are cooked and just reheated but my dish was Luke warm and the service was pretty average. When there are so many restaurants to choose from I was disappointed with my choice.
3
Cheep and good Thai and Indian food. Both for eating in and take away.Their western selection I cannot say anything about. I will not touch it as a western. Good service and good cold beer. Usually very crowded byt the people living in the area
4
Was not quite sure what to expect when I first came here, but I was glad that my friend introduced me to Bar Bar Black Sheep.At first glance the menu seems rather extensive as they offer a variety of Indian, Thai and Western food. On my friend's recommendation, I stuck with the Indian food. The garlic naan was superb - just the right hint of garlicky and fluffy with a browned edge. Some places get their naans either under or over baked in the oven - BBBS' naan was just right and hit the spot. I also tried the chicken briyani which was well done also. The only thing I would change about the briyani would be the accompanying yogurt sauce which I would have preferred to be slightly thicker as it was a bit on the runny side. On a return visit, we had butter chicken and palak paneer to go with the naans and were not disappointed with the taste. The serving of the butter chicken was on the small side though - just 5 pieces of chicken that were slightly larger than chicken nuggets.Service can be a bit of a hit and miss depending on how crowded the place is. I have had prompt attentive service and also had problems getting waitstaff attention so it really all depends on the crowd that day. However, I do feel that the service dudes do try their best to get to all the customers in a reasonable time.The outlet at Robertson Quay is an excellent place to chill-out and people watch on a weekday night. BBBS is rated 'very good' for the taste and the ambience - the price is slightly on the higher side considering the portions of the dishes
1
Perhaps I should have heeded others' advise and only opt for the Indian food. The separate menus featuring indian, thai, and western food were confusing. Waiters chased us to make an order when there was insufficient menus to share.Also only one waiter took our order though another waiter noticed that he was doing it slowly because we were a big group.Do not try the thai food! I ate the tom yum fried rice... where was the tom yum flavour? It was simply rice with some chili padi.I tried my friend's rice briyanni which was much better because it was in contrast to my tasteless "fried rice". Will not be visiting agai
2
We had heard about Bar Bar Black Sheep and had high expectations. We arrived early (we had kids) and were able to secure an outdoor seat. The service quality was good but the restaurant was under-staffed. They guy did well but just couldn't keep up. We had one Indian dish and one Thai. The Indian was passable and the Naan was very good. However, the Pad Thai was sub-par. We were disappointed and ate very little of it. It tasted "fishy" and the chicken pieces were grey. We both woke up with the "Dry Horrors" during the night, despite not having an alcoholic drink. I'm not sure if it was MSG or something else. On the plus side, the setting is really good and is relaxed. The waiter was very good (as mentioned)) and the price was very reasonable by Singapore standards. We may give it another chance but overall we weren't really thrilled with our visit
4
There is an enormous choice of similar restaurants here, but this was a great puck. Good choice of tasty fusion food, with Thai, Indian, Australian and other choices. A healthy drinks menu with great beers and fresh juices. Shame they do not offer tap water though.The Tom um soup I had was amongst the nicest I've had in a king while. Served hot with noodles and all the right bits in it... The drinks were served promptly as was the food. They happily let us longer on our drinks and were not rushed at all. The other diners also seemed equally friendly and relaxed, meaning this place attracts like minded people. Drinks a little on the $$ side, but the food was good value and excellent taste and quality and well presented. Friendly staff too
4
Love the food here, and I like the Mom and Pop feel to this place - its not too big, so always seems packed, but also cozy and warm! The wait staff are good and do whatever they can to let you know how long the wait will be, or to accommodate you somehow! The best part of course is the food, its delicious! They have three menus, Western, Indian and Thai. We've had the western and Indian, and the dishes always were delicious. Tha thai we've not had the luck to try, since their Thai chef leaves at 9 or some such thing!! Its mostly outdoors, so weather is part of the gamble here, but when its good weather, the riverside ambience can't be beat
4
Robertson Quay BBBS is a great spot to people-watch and enjoy a quiet beer and great food. We enjoy this spot as it offers a range of food options under one roof - good Thai, good Indian, and good western.The quay is very social and allows you to enjoy delicious food and observe the passing traffic. Well worth a visit
4
Really enjoyed the low-key, great value and ambiance as well as an excellent Pad Thai and quick service. Will be frequenting this place a lot more often!
4
Three food choices in one place, thai, indian and american. We tried an indian dish and a thai dish. The portions were generous the food very tasty and excellent value.
3
The Indian and Thai food is great, and reasonably priced. The service is ok, could be better and waiters lately have started being a little short and a little less friendly. However, worst bit is management has gotten greedy and is now charging for water. It's a pet hate of mine so I won't be back.
4
Indian fare is mostly restricted to North & North Western India. This place has an Thai & English cuisine as well. Their Tandoor Naans & Rotis are very fluffy & fresh. Most Veg or Non Veg accompaniments are very tasty. Make sure you time your order well, as the chefs are super quick & the order may arrive in 10min. Tank beer ( Drought beer/tap) is available for most European beer brands. Kronenbourg Blanc is my personal favorite. 1664 is great as well. Some good wines can be explored here in peace. It is a must go dining & bar place if you want to experience cozy river side dining on evenings.Since the place is an off beat location, take a cab to Rodyk Street or walk from Miramar Hotel/River view Hotel
5
Found this place near our hotel, The Miramar. It do Thai, Indian and European food and compared with many Singapore eating places it is very good value. No service charge or GST added to menu prices. Went last night and will be there again tonight. Can't wait.Good value and smiling service
2
We have been to the Bar Bar Black Sheep place at Bukit Timah many times - excellent food, laid back atmosphere, reasonable drinks prices. A great place to chill out.The outlet at Robertson Quay has managed to take the same concept and just get it wrong. The service is extremely poor, with staff who have an attitude that doing the absolute minimum is the way to go. We arrived, and found a seat, and waited. Remembering that at the Bukit Timah outlet you go to the individual stall to order, we went to find some menu's. After deciding what to eat, we went to the stall, but they said the order would be taken at the table. So we waited - and nobody came. We went to the bar to try to order, but was told to wait at our seat. We could not even order a drink.Eventually ordered Thai and Indian food - the Thai was good, the Indian was nowhere near as good as the original outlet. We ordered wine, and asked for a glass of warm water to accompany it. "We don't serve water" was the response. "If you want, you buy". I would have thought that you could get a simple glass of water to accompany some wine.... obviously this has to be paid for too.I was left feeling it was a shame the way an excellent concept has been ruined by lazy staff, and a "don't care" attitude. On a Saturday night everywhere else was full - this place was half full. And with service like that, it will get worse
4
We were in Singapore on holiday where we stayed for three nights before going onto Perth Western Australia while out walking one afternoon we stumbled on the Ba Ba Black Sheep Restaurant and decided to give a go later that evening. What a find the Restaurant was busy but the service was quick and friendly the food was very good and i would go as far to say it was one of the beast Indian meals that i have had for a long time the garlic naan bread was that good i ordered another one. A must if you are ever in the area also a great place to people watch
3
Fancy having tikka for starters, fish and chips for mains and sticky mango rice for desserts..... This place is suited for the variety with 3 cuisines under the same roof (Indian, Western and Thai)....  Located on Robertson Quay facing a quiet stretch of the river, this is a good place to unwind. Food was decent...service can improve a bit but I guess it was the 2nd day of CNY holidays which was more to be blamed.
4
Our hotel(Riverview) was near, so we stopped here couple of times. Every night this place to seem packed, especially if weather was nice, because they have nice terrace right next to river.They served different (asians) cuisines, everything from Indian to Thai and food was good. Not maybe for romantic dinner, but nice relaxed place for little snac
4
Great choice of three different cuisines, Indian, Thai and other Western which was a hit with our group. Relaxed atmosphere, food service was pretty quick, drinks a little slower but it wasn't terrible.Indian food was delicious and when we ordered extra nan it came really quickly. Thai was also good, we didn't try the other menu option
4
On a recent trip visiting friends in Singapore, they took me to Bar Bar Blacksheep. Lots of menu choices. Food was good, ambiance by the River was very pleasant.

This was a nice setting near the river front area. I was staying with my family at Grand Copthorne and we were looking for an assortment of vegetarian food. Bar Bar Black Sheep was a good find as it was just across the bridge from the hotel and had a good choice of Indian food and other stuff eg Pasta, Nuggets et

Actually to begin with, we do not get such food even in Indian restaurants in India.... I ate twice here and the Roti quality was stunning,. very soft. The other subjis like Alu Gobi, Dal Palak were cooked tastefully. My wife and I were amazed at the quality and finally asked the waiter who was cooking the food. They pointed out to a simple person (Indian) probably settled there. Hats off to the cook and the hotel... Bar Bar White Sheep

I had heard great things about this place from many of my friends in Singapore but I was very disappointed when I went there on Aug 10th. The nachos - You cannot seriously call these nachos. Cold processed cheese in a thimble and bad salsa on the side.Buffalo wings - Nothing buffalo about them, they were sweet and sour with no blue cheese sauce.Thai curry - Tasted like cinnamon and had large chunks of cauliflower.I mentioned to our waiter that the nachos were horrible and he took them back and said nothing.Would never eat here or drink here again

Located at Robertson Quay.Good location on the river. Area looks like it’s frequented a lot by expats.Food was ok but nothing spectacular. Prices reasonable. Lots of staff but they weren’t in a hurry to serve anyone.We placed our order. Most of it arrived in a short time but had to ask for a missing drink. It never arrived. Waiter must have gone to the farm to milk the cow!Ended up finishing meal without a drink and just had the item removed from the bill.Probably wouldn’t eat there again unless others in the area booked out

There are three kitchens attached to this bar. Sher (Indian) best curry we've tasted anywhere including Southall in London and Bradford. Eat like a kind for less than $15. Platters serves decent burgers and pastas and a Thai place great salads and curries. Best value in the area which is why it's busy every night. Staff are polite and helpful. You won't get silver service and cloth napkins but you will get great food and value

With a name like this you don't expect to find great Indian food! While there are other options we chose the Indian menu. Unlike some previous reviews we found the service prompt and pleasant. We sat at a table for two on the river side of the pathway and it was interesting to watch the world go by. Lighting is discreet so we didn't feel on show. Drinks arrived quickly and as soon as we were ready to order it was easy to signal a waiter. We enjoyed a lovely fish curry, chicken jalfrasi, fluffy rice, raita, and light naan bread. All very good. We found the prices reasonable

First time here and recommended by friends. A group of 8 of us went after work on a Friday. Service was fine, food ordered and delivered in decent time. Chicken dishes were good as chicken was tender and not tough! It was an unplanned evening but they managed to get us a table. It is outside, so don't expect air con if you go here! Basic, good food. Some decent vegetarian choices as well so my veggie friends tell me that we're with me! I would go back

Although you can order Thai, Indian or Western food here, we both opted for Indian when we visited last night. The service was good and very prompt and the food was very tasty. I'd definitely recommend the Lamb Rogan Josh and also we had a great Lentil dish which I can't remember the name of now but it was so good! The only downer was that they served the bottled water warm but I had a glass with ice so it wasn't a major problem. Compared to other restaurants we have been to along the riverside, it was fantastic value for money, it was only the alcohol that bumped up the price. I will definitely be heading back

As this place is only a short walk from my hotel thought I would check it out despite the negative reviews as I was inthe mood for a beer and a curry. Sat at a sidewalk table and a waiter was with me in a couple of minutes with menu. Took my beer order - I thought order beer first, if it takes forever i will eat elsewhere - and my cold Kronenbourg turned up in three or four minutes. I was left in peace to puruse the menu. It was easy to get a waiters attantion when ready for food and my order of fish curry, naan and more beer was promptly delivered. The beer was cold - both pints, the food was hot and quickly delivered. The fish curry was OK - the sauce was tasty, not sure what sort of fish it was but as advertised there were no bones. The plain naan was light and fluffy.The service was good - and this was prime eating time on Saturday night, the place was very busy with the wait staff having to dodge all of the joggers, pedestrians and kids on scooters as they ran around with food and drinks
2
Pity the service was so slow. Waiter seemed surprised that we wanted something to drink and the beers felt like they had been sat on the bar for a while before we received them - perhaps he was new.
5
We ordered veggie currys here on our first night – 1 word – awesome. The naan bread was lovely. The veggie options were really tasty and just what we needed in our fog of jet lag.
4
Huge range of local food with beers ranging from 'small' (half pint) to 'towers' (6 pints!)
Food quality and service both excellent.
Lovely riverside location, great for people watching.
Kids on skateboards, but well behaved.
3
Carbonara was good. Aglio olio was very spicy. Fish fingers did not taste so fresh. Chargrilled chicken ok.

I live right next door to this restaurant and I can say that it is always busy!It is a combination of three restaurants - Thai, Western and North Indian cuisine - so you can mix and match your order. Strangely enough, they do not serve water to your table but you can go to the bar and get it yourself. Food is cheap and decent (certainly not gourmet though). Service varies depending on the night....not the best around. VERY casual dining. Good location (by the river). Uncomfortable chairs
2
Great location, and when the food did eventually arrive it was tasty and well prepared, but the service was terrible. Getting a beer was a challenge so if you order, get a spare, as the next one will take an age
3
Went in for two pints of 1664 and our order was taken and then proceeded to wait twenty minutes. Not good enough the beer sat on the bar for fifteen I reckon as it was warm when we got it. We will not be back as plenty other places to choose from

Very pleasant location on the riverside, and a good place for an evening beer and/or meal sitting outside watching the world go by. (Also very convenient if staying at the Grand Copthorne Hotel on the other side of the river, and much cheaper!) Food good with many options, as although the menu outside appears to list only western style food at first sight, they also have a Thai menu and an Indian menu, both of which provide tasty food from our experience of having a meal from each. They also offer a few very reasonably priced options for a lunch ‘special’. They have cold drinking water inside, which you can go and get yourself, but you don’t have to as the waiter will bring a couple of glasses if asked (but they don’t bring it automatically), although it’s probably quicker and more helpful in busy times to get it for yourself. All in all it offers a good selection of dishes that should satisfy all tastes, and at reasonable prices

I had a beer and a burrito. Tough to go wrong with a beer on the tap. And the burrito was surprisingly very good. Though it was different from what I had before in the US or NL. Not sure what authentic burrito is like really. Food is cheaper than other places on Robertson Quay I feel

Had an early evening meal here. Chose it as it was close to Hotel. A nice relaxed atmosphere with an interesting menu. Mainly Indian based food. The service was good, however if you wanted Iced water you had to go to the Bar and help yourself. I was having a meal so I thought this a little offMeal was Chicken Kebabs to start followed by Kedai Prawn and Butter Naan. The main course arrived as I was halfway through the starter. Having said that the food was generally good, although they left the tail ends of the shells on the prawns, difficult to see this at night and when they are covered in sauce.The meal above with two Fresh Orange drinks came to S$34.80.I would go back there as it was a nice change from the Hotel food

Fantastic bar, choice of 3 types of cuisine, thai, Indian and Western so could mix and match, Excellent prices. Tandoori platter fantastic

Not as good as cherry avenue but the ambience make up for it..... ;)

We went to the Bar Bar Black Sheep restaurant at Roberston Quay after Our Shopping . Although they was busy The staff manage to get a table for 4 of us.Food was all good from the 3 stalls .Staff were very attentive and friendly.
4
Extensive menu from 3 kitchens, service very fast, great sitting by the river, will visit again, really pleasant atmosphere
3
We went there our first night at it was right outside our hotel, when we were being seated a man commented that it was really nice and worth a visit so we were hopeful. The food was very cheap and the menu was interesting as you could choose from three different smaller restaurants from the one. The food quality was okay, had nachos for starter - poor, a burger for main -alright, £7 and my sister had spagettii - poor, £7. Disappointing but okay if you don't want to spend alot of money on a meal

Stopped by here for dinner on my first night in Singapore. Fantastic service and very reasonably priced. Never had Indian cuisine before but this place had me hooked on the food. Was very nice and didnt have to wait too long. Fantastic atmosphere along the river. Went back 3 more times in the 6 days I spent in Singapore. Highly recommende

I like eating here when I am with a group of people and we cannot agree on what type of food we want. There is something for everyone here as they serve Thai, Indian, and western food. The atmosphere is great- it's a wonderful place to sit outside and people watch

Situated on Robertson Quay, Bar Bar Black Sheep is special because it is not just a tourist hang-out like many of the bars on Clarke and Boat Quays but a good mix of tourists and locals, many out for a stroll with babies and /or dogs in tow. The food is not the gourmet variety, but perfectly acceptable and good value for money. Definitely a great place to have a few drinks and snacks
3
If you are looking for something cheap, for lunch, dinner, or for a drink and as welll something relaxing area... Bar Bar Black Sheep is the one you looking for were Idian, Western and Thai food are available in one place together.Service is poor though because its kinda open counter for your order, but the food and prices is really worth it... I recomend Indian food if you like to eat Indian food.Enjoy!!

We live nearby so we tend to go to the Robertson Quay Bar Bar Black Sheep (BBBS) about once a month.It is one of the cheaper dining options along Robertson Quay. You can also sit really close to the river which gives a nice atmosphere. Rather refreshingly, BBBS does not add service and tax onto the bill so what you see is what you pay. Beers are priced at around SGD 10 net per pint and you can get a bottle of so so house wine for SGD 40 net (or SGD 10 per glass). They also do quite fun ice cooled beer towers if you are a group of people.Foodwise, BBBS has three in-house “hawkers” catering to a variety of flavours. The Indian food is consistently good, the Thai food quite ok but the Western food would really benefit from a makeover. This is in contrast to the original BBBS on Cherry Avenue (Bukit Timah) where the Western food is very good.The really weak area is the service. The serving staff will frequently misunderstand orders, deliver the wrong item to your table, forget dishes you have ordered, etc. Some basic service training would be good
5
Not the best atmosphere but when it comes to the food and location. VERY GOOD
2
This place is within easy walking distance to my place but I must confess, every time I try it I walk away disappointed. There is so much better food in the area. A beer and a bite maybe but sadly, not a culinary delight
3
Food pretty good. Service pretty average. Same view as anywhere on Boat Quay. Cheap Chang beer
2
If you're short on cash and not feeling like cooking at home this place could be a good option. Don't expect to have a high quality meal and a friendly service though.
4
Good enough bar althouh can get a bit lively when a group of guys arrive together. Mind you, I suppose hat can be said of anywhere
5
Excellent curry, good atmosphere and excellent service

My partner was on business so since this bar has three restaurants (Indian, Thai and Burger type foods) and I was on my own for two nights I visited three times in all. Day one, service sucked but food was good (Indian). Day two, food sucked (portobello mushroom burger) service was better. Day three, food was great (went for Indian again) and service was much better. In a lovely location, no waiting time to be seated, beers reasonably priced compared to hotel and a good selection. Staff seemed lost, I'm sure someone must be in charge but unfortunately it wasn't apparent during my visits - service could have been better, I was therefore reluctant to leave a tip as I felt it wasn't deserved

Excellent food (quality and value, we chose from their Indian range) let down by the worst service we had in our 10 days in SGP.Surely good service doesn't take rocket science? A little bit of training, a dash of organisation and top it off with a BIG FAT smile and you'll satisfy most people - no? Here they seemed to be missing all three of those elements.OK, it's closer to being a fast-food joint than a real restaurant but come on, you'll kill the joint if you continue like that :-

Ambience is awesome, something ideal for after-work drinks or weekend chill-out drinks.Service is fantastic and top-notch.Staffs are friendly and hardworking.Food is lovely but you must order the right dishes. I would recommend the Indian Foods,Western (The Hamburgers) and Thai (Pad Thai)Drinks are extremely affordable.I would definitely head back there on a regular basis

I was at Bar Bar Black Sheep 8 months ago with my family for dinner and The service is terible ever I came accross in my life but things are totally different now.I was there again as my friends invited me and I was shock to get the same service as other top restaurants normally we get.I will definetly let my friends and family knows about this.I hope this will stay forever with Bar Bar Black Sheep.Good Food and Cheap Price in Singapore
