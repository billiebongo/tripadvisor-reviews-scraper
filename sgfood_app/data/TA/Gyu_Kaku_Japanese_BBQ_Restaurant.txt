Located within the streets of bars and restaurants in Holland Village, this Japanese bbq restauramt serves pretty decent prime cuts though a tad bit pricy

Gyu-Kaku is considered a low end chain restaurant in Japan.
In Singapore the prices are very steep.
Although they serve Wagyu beef, it is of medium to low end and the meat is not of good cuts.
Service staff are good and polite.

Like all japanese places, but especially places with a focus on delicious fatty beef (drool), it's really expensive. Can't really decide if it is worth it but it's definitely yummy!

Our first family meal at a Japanese and staff were brilliant at explaining options. Probably got carried away but the Australian wagyu need was superb. Whole evening was a great experience, staff even became tourist information by the end of the meal. Recommend without hesitation.

Headed here for lunch with colleagues and had a really nice time. There was an option for them to bbq the meat for us and we took it. It was simple, delicious and the service was splendid. Will defintely go back again.

Japanese BBQ where you grill your own food at the table a great experience. Order plenty of different things to barbecue and share, try ordering the salad platter with dipping for wrapping your grilled meat into its really good. Do not be afraid to ask for advice if you are not familiar with the concept staff is very pleasant and willing to advise you

The menu was a bit daunting when we arrived as I'd never had a Japanese BBQ before and whilst I was completely familiar with 'Gyoza', the concept of cooking your own food over a BBQ on your table was pretty cool.The staff were really helpful and were obviously used to people not really knowing what to do, so they recommended certain plates - I'd suggest you go for the gyoza and the asparagus wrapped in bacon which was lovely! We also had some chicken which was nice, but the Wagu beef was to die for. I'm certainly looking forward to coming back to SIngapore so that I can come back to this restaurant :-

Went here for a business dinner and what a good choice it was. The location is buzzing, lots of bars and places to eat, everyone seems to gather there in the evening.The restaurant itself was a good choice for westerners as it offers set menus of Japanese-style barbecue food, so easy to understand for first-timers with a bit of excitement thrown in by the hot fire bowl in the centre of your table. Some of the food was especially good, such as the steamed cod and mushrooms.Strange choice of wines but who would complain about a Torres Tempranillo.Loved it

Longing for some Aussie Beef we booked for an early dinner. Great reception and guided to our table with aplomb. The Menu selection was bewildering but the waiter explained everything in detail. I settled for a selection of Tasmanian Beef plus a side of veg and my wife chose the Duck plus a side of veg. A good Aussie Cab Sav was reasonably priced and went well with our meal. Overall a great experience at a very reasonable cost. Cooking our meal at the table ourselves was unique but enjoyable.Reccomended

When i saw the beef selection, i was surprise to see so many kinds of beef, taste it good also, quite expensive but if you are a beef fan then this is just the place for you.

Very nice place, the food taste great and comes in pretty good quality.but the price was too expensive for a student. you can cook the food the way you want.We ordered the set meal with the spinach salad. Everything was just perfect.
5
Had the set menu great fun to cook your own meat on the charcoal grill and excellent quality the service was good and some help was given by our waitress as we had never been before.
Would certainly go back again

Everything was great but the Hirami Miso was just incredible. Service was good as well and the food just kept coming. Can be a little noisy, but is a festive place. Had a great meal here and will be back for sure.

for first timers, alot are unfamiliar that this is a FRANCHISE therefore this outlet is similar to the outlet at CHIJmes, thus what differentiates this branch is the service which is good. Nice intimate setting for a meal with typical Japanese setting & with a wide selection of drinks

A chance discovery, this is a top venue with first-rate food and service. Our party went for one of the set barbecue menus after some sushi rolls for starters, the lot washed down with perfectly heated sake and beer. And what a BBQ it was! The meat portions were huge and of superior quality, even though we didn't go for the (overpriced) Kobe beef they were advertising. The service was excellent, with the waiter doing most of the BBQ'ing so that the diners could concentrate on the important business, like scooping up the delicious food from the hotplate! More Korean bulgogi fest than Japanese BBQ (but who cares!), the desert menu also included a Singapore special, black sesame ice-cream. To be recommended! And if you're still able to move after this kind of Pantagruellian fare, you can explore the mall in which the restaurant is situated and chill in one of the late-night bars that offer live music

This was probably the best meal we had in 10 days in Singapore - and we ate lots of good meals!We weren't familiar with the menu so decided to go with the set menu - which was a great choice.We had a delicious spinach salad, a wonderful selection of meat to cook on the charcoal grill as well as fish and mushrooms, accompanied by delicious sauces and a lovely refreshing citrus sorbet to finish.The staff were attentive and helpful, and it was a very enjoyable night out.Highly recommended, though pretty expensive

I first visited Gyu Kaku in Osaka and was blown away by the huge selection of beef and their special sauce rice. Hence when i saw that we have an outlet here, i couldn't wait to try it. The selection of beef here is almost equally extensive with the same different sauces to go with it like the rock salt, tare shio and miso and the quality of meat is good. Only thing is, it's quite pricey as compared to Osaka. Expect to spend about 40sgd and above per person or even more if you are a beef lover. Also, i was disappointed that they didn't have the special sauce rice as i had in Osaka. In fact for the least, they should serve Japanese rice but it was just normal plain rice from elsewhere. But the quality of the beef do make up for it. Their service is attentive and prompt

Food is nice but Price is too pricy for regular visit.

Excellent service, the quality of the meat is really outstanding, especially the Japanese Wagyu. Really liked the Spicy Miso marinade on the short ribs and the oyster mushrooms.

Wagyu beef with tare marinade was great. Pear salad was also fantastic! Can't fault anything - service was attentive.We did not have dessert as we were too full. Price was reasonable compared to other Japanese/Korean BBQ places in Singapore.What else can I say apart from GO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!

We hVe been there during a 2 day stop-over in SG. The food is good but from my persepctive not as food as the prices are. 2 persons starter and meal plate > S$ 300,- incl. the delcious Asahi Beer.For the price requested I have expected a nicer place. Its located in a corner of the Chijmes Plaza and the Interior is more a pub atmosphere than fine dining. Very smoky because of all the table bbq - which is reeally - and rustical. The beef was great and salad and starters (crab meat / saussages ) we had were delicious. Staff was very friendly. Improve the Interior and the menu cards (which looked very used) and it will a great plae worth spending the money
