The flavours of each dish were delightful. Potato salad (causas) that’s way fancier than what we’re used to. Comes in several options that are worth sharing and trying. Their specialty is the ceviche which is a definite must try. We decided to share so we can try as many dishes as possible.

Arrived in Singapore on Friday and couldn’t get a weekend booking so had to wait until Wednesday for a dinner booking at Tono. It was worth the wait. The service and food were excellent. The food was beautifully presented, fresh and packed with well balanced flavours. Can’t wait to go back and sample more of the menu !

I am a Peruvian living in Singapore for nearly 9 years and discovering TONO Cevicheria in Singapore was a dream come true. The first Peruvian restaurant in town, as the menu is entirely comprised by Peruvian dishes and those that I tried taste like the food I grew up with in Lima, Peru.The food is nicely presented and the service is good. The chef has really good hands to prepare Peruvian food. Food was awesome! The dishes are small, but enough to feel satisfy, as long as you order two or three appetizers and one main dish. The cebiche clasico (raw fish) was supreme, same as the pulpo al olivo (octopus in an olive sauce). The arroz con mariscos (seafood rice) was delicious as well. Among the desserts, I tried the tres leches cake (a cake with fresh, evaporated and condensed milk) and it was a great way to end my dinner. Just one piece of advice, the pisco sour, Peru's emblematic drink, was kind of weak, not as punchy as the real one is. I think the bartender prepared it with too little pisco. Please add more pisco to the drink! Despite this minor disappointment, I give five stars to the restaurant, since the food makes it worth any visit. You will not be disappointed. Be aware that the food is not on the cheap side, but it will satisfy any craving for Peruvian food. Similarly, if you want to try Peruvian food for the first time and appreciate its taste, this is a great place to go

Currently only open a few months (around August 2017), but already proving popular with the enthusiastic foodie community of Singapore, with friendly and knowledgeable staff, this place is doing a great job serving well prepared Peruvian dishes in comfortable surroundings.At weekends, I recommend you get a reservation, it may be some time before you can just walk in and score a table.My only downside is the portions are a little on the petite side, so after 2 excellent courses I did feel I had room for more, and although that may well leave room for desert, I don't do desert

A great Civiche Restaurant in Singapore! What a nice peasant surprise. Found this by accident. And we ended up having a great time! Prices are also very reasonable!

Had a lunch and came back for a dinner because the food was great. The restaurant is located at Duo Galleria which is easily accessible from Bugis DTL exit E.The Chicharron is the finest pork belly I have ever tasted, really melts in your mouth. Price is about $32. The Clasico which is raw fish chunk in Tiger’s milk is also good. They have a few dishes of raw fish so shashimi lover would fit in well. Their flavoring is pretty unique and there’s free flow of bread.Ambience is warm w lively Latin music. Service is excellent and they take the trouble to explain the details of the dish

We visited Tono to celebrate my husband's birthday. At the time of reserving the table earlier I made sure I didn't mention that it was his birthday. The staff are very attentive. The ambience is cosy. The food is beyond awesome and the presentation of the food is unbelievable. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and wine. The staff heard us quietly wish him while toasting with our wine glasses. They surprised us with a birthday dessert and surrounded our table and sang him the birthday song. It was very thoughtful. Definitely visiting this place again. Excellent experience

Located at Duo Galleria, Tono is an excellent addition to the local food scene. First Peruvian cevicheria. Food is fresh, packed morsels of deliciousness. From the fish to octopus to melt in your mouth belly pork, you can taste the love that goes into the preparation of the food. Even the bread comes seasoned, warmed and crusty.Service top marks. Ambience thumbs up. Indoor and outdoor seating. Book early if you need to be indoors.I prefer the sheltered outdoor as it’s more casual. Happy happy eating. Can’t wait to be back!
