Great atmosphere. Not cheap but not over the top. Excellent standard cuisine and efficient friendly service.
5
An absolute gem. Immaculate service. Perfectly cooked and presented food - just like the pictures! You are not going to stumble across this restaurant you will have to book and look, but you will not be disappointed.
5
Four of us went to wakanui for a dinner. We ordered lamb chops and two types if beef plus some sides. The lamb chop and steaks took a bit of time to came but they were tender and juicy. Service is also great!
4
Good food and the setting by the river is prefect for a great time .
Boat Quay overall has many places to eat .
5
We were there to celebrate my husband√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s birthday and the experience was very pleasant. The salmon thing was so delicious. Very nice staff, affordable good food and we really appreciated the private salon. I recommend the place if you want to have a nice dinner with family and friends. 2 things to improve : - hard to find the restaurant - Closing time is too earl
4
Was a planned dinner to check this outlet & we were not disappointed. The service was good and food standard great. Meat dishes like our beef & lamb were great. Though our salads and side orders were good too but the servings were small.But overall a nice place to go for a nice meal and I'll be back to try out other items on their menu

Not sure if the maori name means the cuisine is from new zealand. Friend brought me here as apparently this place is bought by his friend. Housed in the "in" place for company offices now, 1 marina. It used to be in boat quayThe location is hidden on the 4th of an office tower so not great. Indeed, it was rather empty during our lunchI had a burger for $25 and it was ok. My friend had wagyu , actually about 5 tiny cubes, for $50. That was not okMy bet is this place won't last long. Poor location and overprice
4
Firstly, the location of the restaurant is not that easy to find - West tower of the new building in Singapore. The receptionist seems to be quite new to the industry and was a little blur. Itoh san provided great service to us and brought the chef to every table to hear reviews about the food at the end of the dinner. Food was great. Best dish of the day was the hot smoked salmon! Really soft, fresh and juicy. Our medium rare steaks were well cooked. Oh the $8++ lamb chop was so tasty! Spent $771 for 3 people, including 2 bottles of red wine. Not a bad deal
5
A truly great meal on Boat Quay. Treated ourselves after a long, busy week in Singapore. Excellent location. You can sit inside with aircon but we sat on quayside watching the world go by. We chose steaks and various sides. All cooked as ordered and perfectly presented. Meat melted in the mouth and all were very happy with choice of restaurant. We drank Japanese beers with the meal but there is a reasonable wine list if required. My first time at this restaurant but certainly not my last. Highly recommended
3
Went to the restaurant for dinner with a party of 30 people and we used the whole 2nd level dinning hall. The air conditioners did not provide a cool environment for a comfortable dinner. Most of us were fanning ourselves.The beef and lamb dishes were excellent. The other main course was Atlantic cod. The cod was overcooked and dry. Most of us who picked the fish dish took as bite and left the rest behind. Very disappointed with the fish.Perhaps Wakanui should focus on the meat dishes and if want to provide a fish dish , please train the staff to cook it well
3
Nice environment but the food over price . The steak was ok , with cook well done .. the sauce is unique and sweet taste.
4
Very good value for lunch. We had 2 sets. One was the beef cheeks and the other was lamb cutlets. Good stuff!
5
been here twice i like the place good food good location good service..! the meat is so amazing, the wines is ok..overall EXCELLENT.. abit pricy but its ok!!!!
5
Wonderful dining experience with some awesome meat and fish and quality wine. Ambience was splendid and so was the hospitality of the Italian Manager
5
Cozy and relax atmosphere. Food was delicious. The ocean beef was amazing.To talk about the service, friendly and professional! Whatelse can you ask for. Keep it up guys!
5
My family and I dine in at Wakanui last week. The italian manager Alessandro treated us as VIP. The food was amazing. Best lamb in Sg. My family was very happy. Thanks and see you soon
5
Perfect dinner again after 2 months! Thank you so much for the services! I will comeback soon again!!!
5
The steak is nice! 55sgd for 350gm. Worth the money. Worth the trip. Visit it after visiting Merlion. A long walk from there, almost give up, but it is worthy after all. The hospitality from the manager is good. Feel so warmth, and the experience is like VIP. The view from the second floor is good at night. Suitable for couple
5
All I can say is fantastic. It was by chance we went here, walked in without a reservation without issue. The restaurant has two seating areas, one outside overlooking the Singapore river and the other on the first floor with windows that again overlook the river.The food selection is very good, portion sizes are ok and the presentation is top quality. The meat we ordered was just superb, good just right, tasty and melted in the mouth. Along with a number of side dishes that again were of good size and very nice.A little limited on the drinks selection, but plenty enough for the average person.The staff are very attentive, happy and ready to help whenever asked
5
Impeccable! Superb! Whatever you call it! That is there nickname. We visited this restaurant called "WAKANUI" in singapore, close to the river to have some good food and we really did find over the top steak. We had ribeye, filet and lamb. All was amazing and cooked perfectly.Service by Mario was perfect. i will give 5 ‚≠ê star! The Manager Alessandro came few times at the table to check us.We will definitely be back again
5
We ordered a salmon salad, a medium rare 350g ribeye cut steak, a desert and a bottle of pinot.
Everything was perfect. We absolutely loved it. The manager even treated us a shot of lemon liquor from his hometown in Italy.
5
amazing lamb and ribeye! service is excellent. The price is wallet friendly despite locating CBD. Not forgetting the selection of the New Zealand reds.
5
I have been to Wakanui twice and both times I was blown away by the quality of the spring lamb cutlet. The service is professional and attentive without being intrusive. I definitely recommend a visit here
5
It was nice experience for us, nice beef and great service as well. We came here together with customer. They also really like here.
Thanks so much.
4
Great service from out Italian waiter recommending Nz food.
Nz beef amazing as is NZ wine list. Thoroughly impressed
5
The quality of food and service here is amazing. Mario was very patient and explained the different types of steak/meats available and what wine its best paired with. Very pleasent dining experience, will definitely visit again.
5
Looking for somewhere to dine in Singapore on a Friday night. Gravitated to Wakanui in Boat Quay and we weren't disappointed. Sensational meal and even better service. Staff were attentive and caring, food was Amazing, Food was Delicious, that is all.. üòúüòúüòú
5
I don't ever remember such a pleasant, delicious dining experience ... primarily New Zealand beef and lamb, with other items available, we had the most perfectly done meats. Fillet and Lamb rack, served with no distractions, just perfectly plated (lamb on a board), and presented. Neither of us ever had a better piece of meat. I had a delicious fried calamari ... my husband a barely adequate ceasar salad (but why, I asked, did you order that with so many other yummy options???) Truffle fries are interesting, fries perfectly done; asparagus yummy. Wine was good ... New Zealand as well. The food alone made it 5 star, but then there was the setting ... along the SIngapore River, on Boat Quay, with the lights of the tour boats sparkling red and green and reflecting off the water, the bridges with spans of colour changing lights, the skyscrapers, Marina Sands Bay roof garden in the distance, the buildings and trees of the Esplanade across the river. As if that all wasn't enough to make one heady, there was Alessandro De Prezzo, the half Italian, half French manager of Wakanui, who carefully seated us so that we would not get dripped on by the rain, delightfully shared some of his background, and who proudly shared the background of the restaurant (2 more are in Japan). And our server was impeccable. Truly a memorable evening, one which will be the gold standard for all other dining experiences
5
I was in Boat Quay with 2 others friends and we wanted eat some good steaks. Internet advise us this place. New Zeland steakhouse with Japanese style.We tried it and we were so happy. The meat was excellent and perfectly cooked.Friendly and professional service. I recommend to meat lovers!
4
Helpful and knowledgeable staff. Oysters were wonderful. We had a rib eye and a fillet steak with broccoli and mushrooms. All cooked perfectly. Couldn't fault the service but although views were great from first floor would have preferred to sot downstairs as stairs are quite steep.
5
I visit here for Christmas dinner with family. Foods are very nice and reasonable. Volume is quite nice too!
5
A simply stunning dining experience! The restaurant itself is located on the bustling stretch of Boat Quay.
The star of the show is the mouth-wateringly scintillating steak! Dining in the private bureau was additionally entertaining. All in all superb!
4
Beef was tender and juicy. Burger patty was moist and flavourful. Go for the set lunch, super worth it!
5
I reserved a table for a dinner with a VIP company guest. The staff were extremely attentive and their recommendations for what and how much to order for our group was spot on. Needless to say, the food was delicious.
5
Came here with friends just before sunset and was there for dinner and drinks. They have a good collection of wine too. We had a table by the river, but you can get one inside the restaurant if you prefer. Definitely will be back.
5
2 things are important at a restaurant, which are food and service, and both are good at Wakanui. Ordered the lamb rack and it was soft and flavourful. Service was rendered by Mario and he is an asset to the restaurant. Nice, friendly and thoughtful. For example, even though my date and I ordered only 1 serving of soup, he separate it to 2 bowls so it's easier to drink. That's good initiative
3
I have used Wakanui before for business dinners and was always very happy with their food and attentive, friendly staff. However, the last visit was somewhat a disappointment. The food remains excellent as before, but the staff service level has definitely disintegrated. I don't think they were understaffed on the particular day I was there but there just seemed to be no one to ask for assistance during the entire night, except for one male staff who apparently was not allowed to take orders....and any other staff who could take orders took ages to come to our table. They also did not bother to clear empty plates even though our table was so cramped with them until we asked, where as the previous time, the staff cleared and replaced used plates with clean ones each time a different dish was served. I hope it was just that one night that the roster happened to be not the best, as we were all satisfied with everything other than the service.
4
A colleague and I tackled the oysters and shared oysters and the 1Kg steak after a hard evening at the Penny Black. Just the ticket!. The oysters were quite sizeable and wonderfully fresh. I convinced myself that I could smell the seawater. The steak was appropriately daunting and we worked manfully to master it. Very tender and beautifully cooked. More extra-muscular fat then I would normally prefer, but there was no cribbing about the flavour. The wine list is all Kiwi. Can recommend the oaked chardonnay. The six yr old pinot was well cellared and presented, and complemented the beef beautifully. Service was friendly and prompt, knowledgeable and good-humoured.Cost $250/person
5
The restaurant is in the middle of a tourist street, but the food is worth putting up with the tourist approach along the street. Once there you forget the hassle with being in typical tourist mile. All starters are really awesome as we were a group and everybody had a different one. The fillet steak was "best one ever". Really tender and such a treat
5
My husband and I were here for dinner recently, having searched online for a place with good steaks and we were very happy that we chose to come here. We made reservations but arrived early, which was not an issue as we were shown to our table right away. Service was really good here, from the staff that took our orders to the waiter that served us cold water. We ordered calamari and a Caesar salad as starters and did not have to wait long for the food to arrive. Both starters were just alright, but then we were here for the steak and we ordered the 1 kg piece with bone. The steak came medium rare, as per our request, with a sauce, whole grain mustard and wasabi. The sauce we found out was a combination of olive oil and some Japanese ingredient, and it was really tasty and went well with the steak.Throughout our meal, our wine glasses were refilled without our asking, water was also refilled. Tasty as it was, we could not finish the steak as it was a very big cut.At the end of the meal, we were informed that their machine is down and they are waiting for the technician. In the meantime, whilst waiting to pay, we were given complimentary desserts and coffee/tea. What a nice gesture!All in, it was not a cheap meal but we felt it was money well spent cause we walked away very full and very satisfied, both with the food and the service. The guys there were really friendly and were most apologetic for making us wait, not that we waited very long at all.The next time we are in Singapore we will definitely be back here! Highly recommended
4
Steak was good. Choices are a bit limited as they add more in size than cut/style. Limited menu otherwise. The river location is nice, but there is no added ambience.
5
This was a family dinner. We ordered many things to try, beef and lamb were excellent, cooked to perfection. The accompanied sauces were great! Service was excellent as well. It was a great experience for us.
4
Located in boat quay, the place offers good meat in a nice atmosphere.
Prices are reasonable for a steak house in Singapore. Side dishes as well as wine are also good value.
Overal, a good option for a middle range steakhouse.
5
Expensive, as everywhere in Singapore, but it's worth every dollar spent.
I booked a table for two via website, and it worked: the table was in fact reserved despite we were a bit late.
Good choice of wines, excellent steak and magnificent service. Strongly recommended.
5
Not a cheap restaurant. But, although it is not cheap, the quality is very good so I would say that the value for money is great. I have been a couple of times and the food is terrific. Lamb chops are a must and the cheese platter is also very good. Both salmon and beef tartars are awesome too! For a meat focused restaurant, I miss some more red wines options, but wine list is correct. Not a big issue though, so the 5 stars are deserved
5
Visited Singapore twice during June and before departing always visit this great venue for what I consider is the best steak in Asia. Whilst the price is not cheap the quality is exceptional and the staff are happy to accommodate anybody. The sides are always too big for one and on both visits they served me a half serve which was ideal. Nothing is too much trouble for the team. Whilst waiting for your meal you can watch the people or the boats meander past which is a great way to enjoying a refreshment before one's meal. Can't recommend this place highly enough
5
Was concerned first because our table was outside, yes by the river so great spot but I really love my AC. I totally forgot about the heat when the food arrived...off course great steaks and can't wait to come back. Good wine selection, appetizer, excellent servic
5
We had 3x rib eye and 1x fillet. All perfectly done to the point. Also the side dishes where great, especially the green asparagus was cherished. Meat is apparently raised from the owners own cattle in New Zealand ensuring the quality of it. Anyhow the proof of the steak is the eating
5
I'm told the Tokyo branch is usually fully booked, no wonder there are other Japanese customers when I was there. 2 of us shared a 500gram ribeye, portion was just right. Medium rare was also done just right. I also like how the meat had a distinct charred taste. The sides - truffle fries, every piece was crispy n not soggy, love it. $160 meal - reasonable. Will definitely come back again.
3
The Boat Quay neighborhood turned out to be my all-time favorite area in Singapore and I left that city only wishing there was something like that closer to home. I loved it! So, this restaurant gets definite points for location. After that everything was just so-so√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ food: okay, and staff: yeah, they were there
5
Amazing food and an amazing view of the Singapore River. Fantastic Steak and lamb. Make sure you reserve a table next to the river.
4
Had an amazing time at Wakanui, food, service and decor are all at the highest quality. Will be back soon. Highly recommended.
5
We were seated at the private dining area upstairs. A beautiful quaint little place this is. The lamb and beef is a must try.
3
I ordered a medium rare beef steak and I had a really hard time cutting through the steak. Steak itself was really good and just the way i like it.. but it takes too much effort to cut the meat.. im a tiny lady with no arm strength so i suggest that the knife be a bit sharper next time before i come back here
4
Was here for business lunch. The set lunch price was quite reasonable, considering it's in the CBD area. Octopus salad, the appetizer, together with Yuzu sauce, was delicious. I had the steak for mains, asked for medium, and it was done to perfection. Preparation was similar to steak I had tried in other Japanese restaurant. Dessert was the lava cake, which is a tad too sweet for my preference. Would definitely come back again for the steak
5
This is my second time to Wakanui and again, it never disappoints. The starters, mains and sides were excellent. My wife and I had a great evening and we ended our meal with two glasses of red wine. We will definitely be back here again :
4
Boat Quay is one of the areas in Singapore where I've been frequently for both lunch and dinner. Luckily for me, I didn't have the chance to try the local seafood restaurants out there. I've heard many of my friends tell good stories about Wakanui so I gave it a try for lunch first. And it was worth it. Steak was done just right when I ordered medium-rate and it was goooood. So, needless to say, I was also there for dinner in another occasion. It's not cheap but I won't say it's expensive either. I think it's priced just right
4
A pretty large gathering at the restaurant. The top floor has a little bar and dinning area that was good for hosting small gatherings.Service was struggling along due to lack of staff.Food was great.....the meats are pretty amazing. We had the ocean beef sirloin, well executed and flavourful. The lamb chops were amazing too. So for meat lovers......well worth a visit.
4
A grill dining serves New Zeland beef and lamb... I specially liked the lamb chop which is so tender and jucy. Dry-aged beef is also good with its tenderness and fravor. I recommend to order 1kg bone-in rybeye to shere with 3-4 persons. Fun to go with Friends
3
Read lots of reviews about this place, all in all an ok steak and ok service, not sure they deserve the bad wrap on service but when we visited it was pretty much standard Singapore service with friendly staff.If your looking for an ok meat eat this fit the bill
5
I have a birthday dinner here with my fiance. Her boss recommend this place, so we give it a try. And it was great! The service, the food. When they know It's my birthday, they give us a "birthday cake"!
I'm definitely going back!
1
Reserved a table and wasn't there when we got there. Was the last dinner as a family and had good reviews. Shame. Food might be good but quality of service is a reason for me never to go back.
5
Yes they do have excellent lamb chops, best in Singapore. Very friendly, nice atmosphere. Will surely eat there again. Better than expected.
4
I like eating on the river a delicious steak well cooked.
Great for the steak lovers, reasonable price for Singapore standard
4
i love the ocean view beef or whatever it's called, but it's probably the best steak for its money i've had in singapore. simply delicious!
5
This New Zealand grill by way of Japan is excellent. I had the full rack of lamb and it was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. The wine list is not extensive but also reasonable for Singapore. Apparently they opened here in Singapore 1.5 years ago. I don't think they are terribly well known here yet but I'm sure that will change as the food is excellent
4
I have visited some top steak restaurants; the Wakanui is a little hidden gem, located towards the end of Boat Quay. I had the steak and was just right, cooked to perfection, it was so salacious and full of flavour, and for the price its truly worth its weight in gold. The staffs are polite, proficient and focused. This restaurant should be in the top analysis. I will definitely be back
1
Having booked a table , and explicitly asked to be outside, and having explained that we just got married, we we seated upstairs.So far so crap.30 minutes later after no one had bothered to take an order. So we left. The worst service in my five years in Singapore. Absinthe, next door, gave us a fantastic meal which I wholeheartedly recommend.
5
Probably the most affordable steak house in Singapore that serves top quality beef. We got a really nice table right by the river and started off with the lamb tataki - great taste and great meat quality. We both choose the fillet - one medium, one medium-rare - and could not have been served a better piece of beef. The quality was top of the line and so was the preparation with a great sear and cooked to perfection. No complaints about the sides, asparagus and potato mash, at all and also the lava cake desert was great! Overall an excellent experience
5
Tables outside have spectacular views of the Marina Bay Sands and we were lucky enough to capture a firework display. Service is excellent and food exquisite. We enjoyed calamari to start followed by 350g sirloin steak with some sides. Was so delicious we had to wipe out plates keen despite it being far too much food! Their wine selection could be improved, it has a lot of very average New Zealand reds. Everything, food & drink, very reasonably priced.
4
Went there for dinner and the quality of the beef and lamb was spectacular. Great service and a nice selection of cheese and New Zealand wines! We will be back for sure!
5
Great Steaks, great lamb and the preparation is flawless - really loved the food and for Singapore reasonable priced. I will be back at my next visit to Singapore. Can just recommend it.
4
about 36oz steak!
Wakanui is the Steak House with serving Dry aged beef.
Very condensed beef taste.
4
the steak house is in front of the river on Boat Quay. Meat is really very good but the service was not attentive. I do like this place
5
My husband found this place several months ago whilst on business and we decided to give it a go last night. We were not disappointed! He missed lunch and was famished when we arrived. They immediately sat us by the river bad brought us bread, which was still warm to the touch. The menu is varied -steaks are the main entree, but lamb, mussels, oysters all appear. We ordered the sirloin and fillet along with a mixed variety of mushrooms and the mashed potatoes to share. Most things appear a la carte as the steaks do not come with sides. We also enjoyed a couple of glasses of the Craggy Range Cabernet. The wine was a perfect compliment to the steaks, Not too sweet nor too dry for my taste. The service was good and the server was very kind, but I will say that we had to call her over more than once to get a couple of basics-water and butter. She was at the restaurant's front, but this is some distance from the outside dining option. I think with a little more experience, this particular server will be a good one; yet, this is a very competitive dining market. The service was still good (3/4 star perhaps) but since the food and wine were so stellar I am standing by the 5 star rating. One last thing, anyone in Singapore should know that dining out, especially anything considered fine dining is pricey. Our meal came to $216 for two. This should be considered when going as well, but it was money well spent! We will be going back when in town!
4
we went there to celebrate my birthday. we order hot smoke king salmon as starter, ocean beef ribeye 500gm for sharing & 1/2 wakanui spring lamb as recomended by them. de service was good & attentive might be we early dine around 7pm as peak hour start from 8-9pm. before we end our dinner, the restaurant suprised me with FOC dessert oven-baked dark chocolate ‚ÄúFondant‚Äù lava cake with vanilla ice cream as birthday gift. this place worth to try the meat & definitely will come back agai
5
this restaurant really can not disappoint - here fits just everything. Great location, great stuff and great food and for Singapore standards very reasonable prices. I do not give often 5 stars, but this restaurant deserve it. Sometimes I would be grateful if the rating system here at Tripadvisor would be a bit more refined - as it is in the moment it can be very misleading and does not always provide the right picture. But guys should you be in the bay area, give this place a visit you wont regret it
5
Wakanui says that it has great lamb and we agree. The nicest lamb I have eaten in Singapore! The oysters were wonderful too. Well considered selection of wines to go with the meal and it was hard to go past the NZ pinots. We celebrated our wedding anniversary and were well looked after by Nazmi and the waiting team. We requested a table on the river and it was lovely to sit in the evening breeze watching the boats go past. A little expensive for family dining but I recommend that you give this place a try for a special night out... make sure it is with meat eating friends or business clients.
5
Wakanui Grill Dining is a steak house on the Boat Quay along the lively Riverside area of Singapore. Its Ocean Rib eye steaks are fantastic, New Zealand Angus beef dry aged in their dry ageing chamber (you can see the beef sides hanging in the chamber through windows), all the ingredients (beef, lamb, mineral water and wines) come from New Zealand and are top quality. You have a choice of seating, as you can sit inside, on the rooftop terrace or across the walkway right beside the Singapore river. The service is quaint and attentive, waiters speak English and Japanese, as the cooking style of the steaks is Japanese. I ordered a 500gram Ocean Rib Eye with grilled green asparagus, a bottle of Antipodes sparkling water (1000 ml) and a glass of Kuku Pinot Noir. To end the experience, I had a Chocolate Fondant as desert. This was a remarkable meal, as this steak was so tender, juicy and flavorful that I could not get enough of it. Pricewise it was very affordable if you compare with other steak places in Singapore (there are many and very good ones), my dinner was less than 100$ US, I will certainly return many more times, whenever I am in Singapore
5
Sat down thinking can this really be as good as the reviews and it was. Friendly, quick service on arrival and throughout the meal. Went for the full rack of lamb ribs which at $54 thought was quite reasonable. When I saw the portion this only confirmed that. Superb amount of meat, cooked perfectly rare. The three sauces were tasty and interesting but the hero was the quality of the NZ meat. Best lamb ribs I've had anywhere. The accompanying Pinot Noir at $12 a glass was also fruity and a great mouthful. Will definitely be returning for the steaks
5
The NZ steak was absolutely perfectly cooked. Sitting right next to the river across from the statue of Raffles makes for a great setting. Wine was good also. Not a low cost food option but the quality is superb.
4
Grilled beef was so juicy and tender. All foods were so perfect then friendly service. I'll be back soon
4
Yesterday we had business function for 15 pax in Wakanui.
I'd like to recommend this place. Modern design, top location on the Boat Quay, discret service and finally fantastic food (lamb and beef are simply masterpices) makes visit in Wakanui a mamorable experience.
5
My wife and I went to Wakanui for dinner on a Saturday night for dinner.All around it was a terrific experience. The menu is simple and delicious. High quality ingredients, mostly sourced from New Zealand, prepared simply and with no fuss.The steak was delicious, and perfectly prepared (I had the medium rare sirloin, my wife the fillet). It came along with a selection of condiments (mustard, wasabi, included), one of which was a delicious sauce with Japanese basil. No idea what it was, but delicious.The pricing is surprisingly affordable compared to other 'steak' restaurants, including the NZ wine (we had Pinot Noir), which was also delicious.The atmosphere was terrific, and the service attentive, friendly yet unobtrusive.For those looking for a delicious simple meal of great meat and veggies, this place is thoroughly recommended. We will be back soon
5
Visited for a quiet dinner on Saturday night- husband chose Wakanui based on an article he found online. Waken does not disappoint. The menu is simple- steaks, lamb and fish for mains, with a decent range of simple side dishes. I chose the 250gram fillet steak, and was thrilled that it was cooked so perfectly. Served with 3 small sauces - wasabi, mustard and a tangy sauce that was delicious. Side dishes of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables were simple but nicely cooked and presented.Wine is all NZ and very reasonably priced (by Singapore standards.)We opted for the assorted cheese board rather than dessert, and at $26 it was really good value- nice assortment of cheeses, quince paste and other bits and pieces- all really tasty. Couldn't fault the service either- we were served mainly by Nazmi- impeccable, friendly service. Overall a great experience that took us by surprise- the food, service and prices made for a great experience and we will certainly be back
5
Been here 4 times now and had the steaks 3 times and full rack of lamb once, all excellent. Good range of Fillet, Sirloin and Ribeye with US and Australian options. Also range of sizes from the 250g up to larger 400g thick cut and char-grilled on the barbie. Ignore the pretentious steak houses in Singapore and go here - 2 twin brothers who run this are good fun
4
Of course , quality like this can never be cheap , but the experience of tasting the best meats in Singapore is well worth the money.Good service and a wonderful view combine to make a most memorable evening , going back tomorrow to try the lamb
4
We had a business lunch at Wakanui and the experience was a good one. Our steaks were excellent quality and very well grilled. The lamb rack was superb. Sides were also very tasty and the coffee to finish was spot on. Cost is mid to slightly above average but seems worthwhile. I'll be back for sure.
5
I had my birthday dinner with friends. Foods are amazing. We tried Sirloin, Rib-eye steak and Spring Lamb. Their Spring Lamb is to die for, very flavorful. The texture of meat is perfect and the best lamb chop I have ever tasted. Pan-fried mushroom and asparagus are so delicious. Service is a bit slow may be because its Saturday night and quite packed but overall its great place for meat lovers.
5
3rd time I've been here and still best meat in Singapore. Forget that it's actually reasonably priced it's as good as if not better meat than you get at CUT for a fraction of the price.Sat outside overlooking the river and nice view of MBS/Fullerton etc - a very nice evening indeed
5
Great rib eye 500g steak. Aged to perfection. Full of taste and cooked just right. Good price point for Boat Quay.
I'll be back!
4
Great location by the riverside, the outside sitting was nice and comfy. We had a huge bone ribeye which was delicious, sides were nice. Service was not outstanding but good and friendly, wine was good too although not cheap. All in all bill was over 250$ for two, so not cheap but the food was really good
4
Took my boss here for a one-on-one dinner meeting. The weather was nice outside so we opted for a table right by the river with a view of MBS. Service was prompt and friendly. I had the rack of lamb, which was outstanding. My boss had a ribeye and loved it. Sides were nicely prepared and generous. . Overall a great experience and I would not hesitate to bring clients here in the future
3
Saw NZ meat and wines and thought we were on a winner...Once we selected the tap water over the bottled option the staff lost interest. From here things went south.. We then decided on just an entree and a glass of bubbles, in a flash our cloth napkins vanished and we were given wipes in plastic pack. The calamari was tasty and the bubbles good but staff attitude left a lot to be desired. We became maybe not invisible but in the way. With so many options to pick from they need to keep service up as many will bar/restaurant hop and they seem to not like this..

Wakanui is a Japanese steak house that over looks the river on Boat Quay. Meat really is really very good. But the one that steals the show is the Full rack of Lamb. Possibly the best in Singapore. Service ( well for me ) has always been very friendly and attentive. Wine list isnt brilliant. Could do with more choice. But the selection they do have, doesnt break the bank. I do like this place even though it is in Boat Quay which never boeds well for fine dining.

There is a lot of choice on this street along the river, but if you have the patience to walk from central part (under the two tower) until almost end of the street you will find this great restaurant. Selection is not huge but everything is great. We start with 6 oysters really tasteful, then with some tips from excellent and professional staff about size of portion we took lamb chop and sirloin steak. Both were good size, perfectly medium cocked and well presented. Taste absolutely great. Side vegetable dish big enough to choose just one to share. Wine selection from New Zealand accompany magically the food. They have espresso honestly not great - but nowhere it is good except Italy - then they offer us some digestive. Two table are on the side of river but also the others not directly on had a great view on river snd opposite museum building. Magic environment at sunset and night. Not cheap as many restaurant in SG but it worth absolutely. Special mention to very kind waitress!

The restaurant located towards the end of boat quay and they have a nice seating area near the riverside. The staff are polite, professional and attentive. The food is really really good. The small lamb appetisers were perfect, and even the few of us who didn't like lamb had a piece. I had the steak and was just right, cooked to perfection. The desserts and the other dishes were equally impressive - I particularly remembered the salmon as it just melted in your mouth. The wine they serve complimented the steaks and made this entire culinary experience one to remember. It is truly worth every cent and is surprisingly, not as pricey as one would expect - in fact its really reasonable for the quality. I will definitely be back this time with my loved ones

We like to try and find the best steak in every city we visit and we stumbled across this place and it topped the lot!Visited last night and sampled the fillet and rib eye between us. The best meat I've ever had, and I don't say that lightly! Perfectly cooked, the charcoal grill give an amazing flavour and the meat is so juicy and full of flavour.Also a bonus that the staff are some of the friendliest I've ever come across. If you bag a table on the river bank like we did its an amazing setting. Watching the sun go down and relaxing is pretty special. The area is crowded with restaurants and bars but the class of this place really stands out!We've visited some top steak restaurants at home in England and while travelling and this comes top

We were just passing by when we decided to have a seat for dinner. We ate a house Cesar Salad which is good as it has bacon what makes it tasty and different and a ocean beef sirloin. The beef was really good, juicy, and pretty similar to almost every steak house we ve been (btw se are brazilians ;) ) We also had ice cream for desert and it was very very good. The view to the bay makes everything even better. I surely recomend this place!
