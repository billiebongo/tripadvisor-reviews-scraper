At first, you don't really see the entrance to the restaurant. We arrived around the opening and the staff was super friendly. A friend recommended this place and I must say that everything was perfect. Price was reasonable and the food was delicious.

I love the food at Box n Sticks. Very good fish and yakitori for affordable price. I recommend the place if you want to have good and diversified Japanese food.

Nice outdoor seating wathing the world go by and right next to (so-called) Witbier bar, good food and attentive staff. Pricey but worth it.

Been to this casual Jap dining place many times and really love the food there. Tried quite a number of items there and listed some of my favourite items below:Mentaiko Cream Pasta - if you like mentaiko, you'll definitely love this yummy creamy dish.Chicken Furikake Aglio Olio - nice twist to the usual aglio olio with fragrant garlic bits plus generous serving of chicken bites Asari Sake - house special; clams cooked in sake Buta kakuni buns - a.k.a Kong Ba Paos with pork belly fats that melts in your mouth! :DEihire (grilled stingray fin) - perfect dish to go along with a nice glass or asahi/beer or good on its own.Overall nice and friendly atmosphere for lunch and dinner with awesome food. Prices are reasonable and value for money too. Still got many items which I've not tried yet. Will definitely return to try other items. :D

Discovered this restaurant by chance and was pretty impressed! The restaurant itself is rather small but nicely decorated. The lunch menu is a set one with various options ranging from $11-18 and each option comes with free sides and a drink. The food was delicious and the price was very reasonable considering what's included. Do note that if you're going at a busy time it might be better to make a reservation beforehand to avoid having to queue

Came here for lunch today with a friend. I opted for the salmon teriyaki set and he chose one of the pasta dishes, and we each had 2 sides included in the set with a tea. Price was only $30 for the lot, which seemed like very good value. Not too busy today. Worth another visit

had first noticed box n stick walking by and it offers an interesting menu and relaxed-original atmosphere and offers perspective of simple Japanese snack at rather soft price. we finally went and :- were very happy with the setting and the staff and the price indeed.- were less lucky with the food. tuna tataki is excellent. pork belly buns (maybe not Japanese, but i love that) also excellent as long as you remain very light on the accompanying sauce which is overly sweet. the beef over rice with an egg was OK but the beef happened to be quite fat without presenting the texture and taste of wagyu. unfortunately, i am not so fond of beef fat. the sticks were the largest disappointment. they do not look, and certainly do not taste like coal grilled sticks, rather electric oven baked one. the chicken yakitory was painted with cloying thick industrial sauce and the pork belly "lightly salted" was good indeed but was at my limit for salt content, which limit is way too high according to my gf.net is : i do not regret to have tried it, it ends up priced below average for my Japanese dinners, but i am not sure i will recommend it

Me and my bf just passed by but got attracted by the decor of the shop. We queued for a while. We ordered a sushi roll, park belly bun and sticks and onigiri. Which is all nice and well worth the price. Service is also good and fast. Best hidden gem in bugis!一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一

We had dinner here tonight, and it was great. As we never can decide what to eat so we ordered both sushi, sticks and soup. Must try the maki topped with cheese - it was really delicious. All the food had great taste, the staff friendly and helpful- and the restaurant made the experience whole.. Note that the soup have much taste - not just strong - but really tastefully. Will definitely go there again if we have the chance.

The time was about 2pm on a Saturday, I was wandering around the area of Kampong Glam and starving.I was desperately looking for a place to eat when I stumbled Box n Sticks. From the name, it would be hard to guess what kind of food it sold but the exterior looked Japanese so I could deduce that they sold bentos and yakitori sticks. I approached the shopfront and I saw a waiter bring out a dish of pork rice with egg (buta shogayaki don) and I was immediately sold.Upon entering, the atmosphere was similar to those small town bars in Japan but with Jpop music.What was surprising was the affordability of the food items. The lunch set meals are definitely worth the price, ranging from $10.90 - $16.90. Sets include a drink, 1 or 2 sides and sometimes miso soup. On weekends, dinner a la carte items are available during lunch too. Also, look out for the alcoholic drinks promotions.For the price, I didn't expect much quality wise but I was shocked that the food was great! To match the food, service was great too. Attentive staff who actually go the extra mile and take a lot of initiative.I was really glad to have stumbled upon this place and I would definitely come again to try more dishes

nice little place with quite an few choices of jap food. luv the bbq stuff..go next door after dinner for some good german drafts...

Their lunch set menus are of great value. For dinner, they only offer a la carte food which is good and tasty but it won't fill you up unless you order a lot.

Very tasty fresh food and friendly staff. Will come again. Sashimi salad and Gyu Niku Teriyaki very nice and well priced.

I've been here many, many times and it never disappoints. The food is good and value for money. There's a new dinner set menu now too. Nearest to Nicoll highway mrt station, it's surrounded by many shop houses. The owners are a friendly bunch too!

In a lively suburb filled with textile shops in the day, and bars in the evening, Box n Sticks was a joy to find. We enjoyed some really great sushi & sashimi, Japanese beers and some excellent chef recommendations/specials. Check out the sweet potato patty which was delicious. Small & compact with some seating outside, the cafe style eatery is clean, quick & good value

Came here for my farewell lunch and it's quite crowded during lunch time. The staff manage to get us a corner seat for 4 but we had another friend coming so initially they added an awkward table but after the next table customer left, the lady quickly combined both the tables together. Ordering process was quite easy, I order the Sake don, comes with 2 sides which I picked chawamushi which is quite tasteless and sesame ice cream which taste quite good. Lovely little space. Think they are quite short handed during lunch

Quaint and quirky place. Compact. Nice location in the heart of Kampong Glam which is a vibrant area in Singapore, a microcosm of all cultures and cuisines that are Singapore.Food was nice. Their chicken Katsu Curry was very tasty. As were the deep fried Gyoza.Staff were fun and attentive. Decent value for money too with draught Asahi at SG$8 per glass

Been here with my family twice before. We coundn’t come back due to limit of time. What a pity! The food is absolutely amazing with cheap price.You can choose Sushi, pasta or another lovely foods but we were strongly impressed by chicken ball and bacon-mochi. It would be a mistake if you didn’t try it once here.We’ll definitely come back here again if we have another chance to go to Singapore

Very nice and yummy food at an affordable pricing :) Weather its their sushi or their pasta, you wont be disappointed. They do have a nice selection of choices for you to choose too! their staffs there are all very friendly and helpful. Even when they are very busy, they will still serve you with a smile, unlike other places that i know!This place is really suitable for family, a get together session with friends or if you like, a peaceful time with your love one. I would recommend the wafu salad
