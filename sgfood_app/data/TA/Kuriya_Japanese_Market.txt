I'm probably being a little generous with my rating of 4/5, feel this place deserves 3.5/5. Anyway...we dropped in at Kuriya for a quick lunch recently, and while the diner does find sushi-related items, ramen, tempura, and bento meals here, the quality of the food ranges from mediocre to decent. I chose a spicy ramen dish that was low on spiciness, slightly too high on saltiness, and just lacking enough oomph. Overall, prices can be a little steep depending the individual item, and while table space is adequate, it can be a tight squeeze (think elbow-to-elbow) at times

my first time here.ate the chicken katsu bento with curry...the rice is fluffy and cooked well the japanese style..curry is not enough to cover my rice..however it come with a steamed egg not only pleasant in look but also very tasty..my potato croquette tasted crunchy crispy like my fried chicken katsu...will be back for more

Kuriya Japanese market is located in Basement1 of Tampines 1 shopping centre, just off the MRT. The restaurant is styled around a Japanese mini-market, with a small supermarket section selling various condiments, raw (sea)food and Japanese cheesecake, and a series of individual stalls set around a central seating area. It's self-service - queue to pay, collect your food when it's ready. On offer are udon, sushi, ramen and bento boxes. Seating (like most places in Singapore) is a premium during the lunch and dinner rush hours, and don't expect a soothing ambience during these times. Food is reasonable - for prices ranging from $10-20, expect simple styled meals with acceptable quality. We've taken the bento sets several times, and though not the best we've ever eaten, they are reasonably good
