We come here fairly regularly for teh-c and kaya toast. It's a pleasant place to stop for a chat or even to sit and work for an hour.

We had breakfast here a couple of times. Great value sets- we had coffee, 2 eggs and kaya toast. The eggs are soft boiled but they did ask us how we wanted them. The coffee is so good. This is a must try for breakfast when in Singapore! There are lots of other meal and drink options that look so good- will be back

We stayed at the hotel above Fun Toast and preferred to head there each morning for a light traditional breakfast at a very fair price, less than S$5.00 each.We stuck to the set menus, usually soft boiled(very runny) eggs, kaya toast and Kopi (coffee).Breakfast at Fun Toast is one of my fondest memories of Singapore, give it a go

Fun Toast was the only way I was going to get some Kaya Toast and Gula Melaka Tea while in Singapore as my family didn't enjoy going out to food courts and hawkers stalls. The kaya toast was tasty and the tea was wonderful. Very basic dining but great value for money

This us our second time in Singapore and, thank heavens, Fun Toast is still there, serving fantastic Kopi and set menus with eggs or some interesting local offerings.Service is quick and friendly. Nothing fancy but a great way to start the day with breakfast that won't break the bank

We found this place on our first day in Singapore and got hooked on their Kaya Toast and iced teas. Being just under the hotel we stayed at meant it became our breakfast of choice, the food is excellent and cheap. On the last day we even tried some of their lunch menu with the Chee Cheong Fun and Mee Siam which didnâ€™t disappoint. The large variety of hot and cold coffees and teas sure has something for everyone. It seems there are a lot of places selling this specialty toast and we have tried a couple of them and this place has the best one

A great start to Singapore River walk or Wonderful end after a morning walk around the Fort Canning Park ;)Love the awesome Almond cereal milk and Almond Ginger tea....if one is not going for the nice Cuppa of Coffee. Tucked in the nice centre of the vicinity, yet still some privacy. So glad that all the Staff r helpful too !Besides the Regular local must-haves Toasts ( with a touch of their Fun versions ) , the offerings on the menu definately has something for anyone. Somehow I think that soon they may just add more Fun in the menu for Lunch too. Thank you very much

I would recommend all coffee lovers to try Kopi - the local version of coffee. The coffee is so good. The cafe has a big sign to assist with how to order your Kopi my own recommendation being Kopi c. The kaya toast with soft boiled eggs is very very good here. We also tried the beef ren dang and would recommend that. The food and drinks here are very cheap. The Kopi is only $1.80

This is a chain of quick food restaurants around the city. I ate a light dinner at the outlet on the ground floor in Liang mall. I had the beef rendang, which was good and spicy. It is served with rice and fantastic pickled vegetables. That, along with a glass of iced ginger tea was about S$8

A good breakfast option if you are staying at the Novotel upstairs - by pass McD's and experience a Singapore breakfast. Order the kaya toast set: two boiled eggs, toast with butter and kaya ( coconut jam) and two coffees was only about $4!Staf were efficient but helpful when I couldn't work out how to get soy sauce to go with my eggs ( dumb tourist!
