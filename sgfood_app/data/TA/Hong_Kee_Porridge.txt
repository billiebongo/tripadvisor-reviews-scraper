Ignore the cook & assistants' impatience. The pork & fish porridge is good. Somehow, I wished to desalt it (or was it MSG) .

This is the better of the two porridge shops here. Good porridge and good sliced fish.
The only disappointment is the fish sometimes has bones.

It gets a 4 stars for flavour and general Yumz and an extra 1 star for value. I mean it's $3.30 for fish with meatballs and an egg!!! Nowadays, where to find?!??The porridge was smooth and creamy to start things off. I spied inside the stall and I saw a HUGH pot with a wooden lid. I know what that stores...more of this awesome porridge!I opted for fish slices and meatballs as this is my favourite combination! The fish slices are not thick but you can still taste the natural sweetness of the fresh fish! The pork meatballs are also very tasty! The seasoning is just on point, not too over powering but yet tasty aplenty in every bite. I love raw egg in hot piping porridge. Something about this combi that I cannot resist. Highly recommend anyone who has a porridge hole to fill
