I used to work in Novena Square, which is just opposite the restaurant. This was the place I come to for homely peranakan food that taste like someone’s grandmother had prepared specially for me. I love the sambal sotong, beef rendang and the nyonya mixed veg.It had been a while since I lasted visited, as I no longer work in the vicinity. We drove past today and I decided to pop by. The restaurant, pretty much, stays the same. Still as unassuming as before. The dishes tasted nostalgic and the server still hurried me to place my order and not giving me 5 more minutes to consider what I want to eat. Actually, I do know what I wanted already, just that I kind of wanted to eat everything but knows that my stomach might literally bursts, if I do.I looked around, the other patrons seem like they are no strangers to the restaurant too, many are returning regulars, like me, who still misses the taste of the nyonya grandma

This has been our family restaurant for 15 years and it has never disappoint. Over time, I’ve seen price hike from 15$ per head to $20-25 per head for a sumptuous meal. This is essentially a one man show with another cook in the kitchen. So don’t expect waistcoat service. Jeffrey, the owner is brisk and business-like but the service is consistently prompt. Don’t expect small talks either as he is often rush off his feet. Sure, he takes some liberties with his interpretation of some of the dishes, eg adding Chinese spinach to his bakwang kepeting (soup) but we do that at home all the time with different vegetables. Hell, my Mother even added cabbage until we stop her! Essentially, what you get is a home-Peranakan experience. I enjoy all the vegetable dishes and will give a star to the following dishes:Bakwang kepeting (soup with mince pork and crab meat)Ngoh hiang (prawn and mince pork roll) Nasi goreng (best fried rice!)Sambal kangkong The Assam prawn is a tad too sweet for my liking but the Fish curry is good. This is possibly the BEST Peranakan restaurant at an affordable price. It is our go-to and we are there once a fortnight. I would even go as far as to say that it is better than some other restaurants that charge twice the price. I’ve resisted writing a review for Novena as it doesn’t seem to need it - business is always brisk with mainly local patrons but perhaps this is one gem that we can no longer hide! Don’t change Jeffrey! - Except more smiles ... :

Brought my HK cousin n friend there last nite as recommended my SIL that food is good in this hidden Gem of Novena. Tried a few home style cooking dishes, can only say the soup is disappointing. We had the Hee Peow soup, it was lousy, tasteless and how can one add spinach to this soup, next is the bakwan kepiting, no one add spinach, really spoilt the soup & a disgrace to the Peranankan. Their chap chye was ok, Assam Pedas fish was flavorful, chendol not enough gula Melaka. Ngoh Hiang, was too flat, filling inside was alrigh

Went there with the family and the tried several home style cooked dishes like the fish head curry, beef rendang, chicken buah kelauk, sambal kangkong and so on with chendol for dessert. It was on a weekday night for dinner. The place filled up by 8 pm. Service was reasonably good for a two man operated shop - one cook and the boss waiting the customers. Overall good for service, food and price

This restaurant has been at Thomson Road for a very long time. It used to serve sets, then stopped, but appears to have started again. Their sets are really value for money, while the Peranakan food is well, home cooked, which I like though may not appeal to all Peranakans since apparently the same dishes are cooked in slightly different ways in different Peranakan homes. Because the restaurant is run by an elderly couple, the husband may be slightly grouchy at times esp if the restaurant is crowded, and he is feeling harassed. However, he is not rude.

If you do not mind the 1980s style decor, and you are just going for the food, you will not be disappointed.Food: We liked most of all the dishes we ordered (chicken curry, beef rendang, mixed vegetables-chap chai). It tasted like home cooking, without overdoing it with the richer, artery-clogging ingredients such as coconut milk. We did not feel like we needed to go on a diet the day after.The only dish I did not like much was the sambal prawns, which was too sweet for me, but that's my personal taste.Service: We went on a quiet, weekday night. Ours was one of 2 tables. We were served by the only male waiter, who was polite, honest (did not pressure us to order more dishes than we could eat), though unsmiling. We did not mind as service was always prompt.Would we go back again? Yes, definitely

My family went there last Saturday for a birthday lunch. On arrival at about 12 noon, the restaurant has no other customers. I asked the waiter for a table of seven. He asked me, 'Did you make any reservation?'. I said, 'I'm not sure. My son is the one who organises this lunch.' He replied, 'You should make reservation before you come.' Then he directed us to one table. I felt very unwelcome! We ordered a number of dishes. They were all authentically Peranakan. The Ayam Buah Kelauk was excellent. The sambal kangkong was good - the kangkong was young and not over-cooked, and it was not too spicy. By the time we left, only two other tables were occupied. Many tables were still unoccupied!

This is my favourite Peranakan restaurant in Singapore. It serves delicious home-cooked nonya food. I always order the Fish Meat Assam Pedas, Ayam Buah Keluak, and Nonya Ngo Hiang. Served piping hot, the intense flavours and gravy go very well with rice. It's practically a one-man show here - Jeffery is owner, cook, order-taker, waiter, cashier, and table-cleaner. So if you are lucky enough to get a table here, be quick with your order, eat, pay, and go. Don't dilly-dally

Always passed by this homey restaurant that seems in need of a renovation and patronised the neighbouring Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant instead.Decided to give it a try one dinner and after that kicked myself for taking so long to visit the place.Every dish was authentically Peranakan and cooked to perfection and all came piping hot in claypots or immediately from the flying pan.The Babi Pongteh was melt in your mouth savoury goodness with the perfect balance of taucheo (salted soya bean paste). whats a start to a most memorable meal.Next arrived the sizzling Bakwan Ketiping soup (crab meat, minced pork and bamboo shoot balls). Every bite was close to culinary orgasmic.The Ikan Asam Pedas (Tamarind Paste Fish) was spicy but the fish very fresh and the gravy paired well with the extra helping of rice.Nyonya Chap Chay (Stewed Mixed Veg) was ubiquitious but still melt-in-your-mouth tasty.What really impressed me was the Ayam Goreng (was wondering why it was last to arrived); it came scaldingly hot right out of the frying pan instead of some pre-fried stuff light almost all other places. Each piece was so juicy and delicately seasoned but since it came last, the law of diminishing returns set in some what.The only less than perfect dish was the Ayam Rendang which my family found the gravy unusual, mutton tasting.Service was decent, polite and efficient considering there were almost full house.Every small portion was more than sufficient for four big eaters and each priced below $10.Will we be back? You bet we will! Sorry Hong King Street, you will be the loser now

If you're in the mood for Peranakan* cuisine you have to try this restaurant. If you don't know what Peranakan cuisine is then you definitely must try this restaurant.Peranakan cuisine is the marriage of Chinese ingredients and cooking styles with a rich blend of Malay spices and herbs.I like to think of it as Asia's version of creole cuisine with equally rich, spicy sauces that, when made properly, take hours to prepare. When it comes to my recommendations for this restaurant the best one is to ask for extra rice (which is included in the price of your meal) because you will want it to finish every drop of the sauces! If you're new to Peranakan cuisine then you have to try the following: Nonya Hgo Hiang- a yummy tofu skin wrapped five spiced, pork rollAyam Buah Keluak - Keluak is a big black nut with a earthy flavor that gives this chicken dish its unique flavor. Ikan Assam Pedas- a mouth waveringly sourish, tamarind flavored, fish dish loaded with brinjal and ladies fingers.Chap Chai- A scrumptious, stir fried blend of mixed veggies, including white cabbage and cloud fungus Babur Cha-Cha - a colorful, sweet end to your mealOr you can skip my recommendations and do what I do which is try something different each time I go because everything is delicious and tastes home made. If you're wondering about the prices many of the dishes come in small and large sizes. My girl friend and I are big eaters and we like to try new things so we ordered four small size dishes, plus had water (free) and a chinese tea and we walked out feeling very full. The bill was only $40. Oh, one more thing, the owner puts little Amex Reserved signs on all the tables so you might want to call ahead and reserve (although I never do) because they really fill up with locals between 7-8pm. (*Also referred to as Nonya Cuisine
