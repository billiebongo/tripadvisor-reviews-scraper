Great food, good services. Staffs are very friendly. Atmosphere is cozy, price is reasonable. I would recommend my friends to come.

Been a regular since the day i found the place. My favourite dish is the chai por koay teow and the fish mow soup. For 1 person, this will set you back by only $9. Try the crab meat ball, cold crab, oyster omelette too. The orh nee dessert is very good too. Highly recommended place for a simple teo chew meal that won't burn a hold in your pocket

Brought the family for a lunch to celebrate my father birthday and chinese new year. Went to the new seletar aerospace branch. The food are priced fairly. Must try the signature noodles and the fish porriage. The location however can be access by driving or cycling. No public transport goes there. Worth a visit and do check out thr nearby bistrol too
