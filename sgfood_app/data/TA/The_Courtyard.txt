Great selection of different food, Asian, English food. Fresh and tasty, and good value for money. No need to book, just pop in and dine.

Great place - good food - reasonable prices - excellent young girl who was so helpful and pleasant. Right off the main entrance at the Rendezvous so if you stay at this amamzing hotel drop in to this restaurant.

a nice place for the boys in our party to enjoy a quiet one at end of day. It was spacious, cool despite not being air conditioned

We had dinner here one night which was excellent but quite pricey compared to other local eateries. Nice place for a cold drink after walking around in the heat, but again quite pricey. Staff here were excellent

Reasonably priced food and drink, considering the comfortable surroundings, the set breakfast is particularly good value.

Very light and airy , quiet and with attentive service -- an interesting menu with many varied options and not that expensive. If your room rate doesn't include the cost of breakfast , ignore Straits Caf√© and go to the Courtyard instead.
