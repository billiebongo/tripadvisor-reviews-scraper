We sat down in this nice bar with a piano player and enjoyed a nice couple of wines before going upstairs to bed. We had a wine and little bit of tapas and it was nice. Very comfortable with very nice service.

If you are looking for a good collection of whisky have a visit on this bar their collection is amazing. Some of their whisky is from 1977 Pulteney, 1978 Glencadam and Silver Seal 25 years old Port Ellen etc. The bar staff are very friendly and helpful . Thee wagyu beef burger is phenomenal very juicy and tasty. The live music completed the whole experience! Highly recommended! Thank you Team ASTOR

Drinks are well made, the server in this bar are very polite, very friendly and accommodating to guest. The only good service I experience in the entire hotel was at the Astor Ba
5
A warm and friendly welcome with fantastic guest service. Always great, delicious and refreshing cocktails- just the way we like it. Would definitely recommend. We have been many times and it has consistently exceeded our expectations.
5
Me and my husband visited astor bar few time and we still love it. We love the drinks and the ambience, perfect just to relax after a long day at work. Must try the snacks and cocktails
5
Still as awesome as always! Favourite bar in Singapore and I don’t take that lightly. Service and drinks are always on point. Keep it up guys and I’ll be back!
5
The Astor Bar at the St Regis is unique, in that it removes you from the wonderful hustle and bustle of Singapore, and transports you to an elegant, sophisticated bar reminiscent of "member's only" clubs of New York or London. From the Picasso prints to the selection of fine whiskies, you know that you are somewhere special. I found the service to be exceptional; I would like to commend Imran and the team, who were welcoming, genuinely hospitable and shared great insight about the bar and Singapore in general. They were completely engaged with their customers.If you are looking for substance over style, quality over quantity and superior levels of service then this could be the place for you
5
I’ve been to many different bars in Singapore, and I can say that Astor is one of the best place to go when all you want to do is chill and relax. I liked that they don’t have to go with the trend of having loud musics, and the idea of having live singers with stellar voice is a steal. You pay 5 and get 10 in return. Awesome experience made possible by the impeccable service and the great live music
4
Nice, quiet, discreet place for a drink with friends or work discussions etc.. It's not cheap but you pay for the ambience and the location. Service was top notch
5
I’m always having meetings at Astor Bar and these ladies and gentlemen took care of me extremely well. I must specially mention Mr Christian, Mr Imran, Mr Ron, Mr Hackett, Ms Lorna, Ms Margie, Ms Jo for ensuring my experience is always a pleasant one. These staff are the ones who make Astor Bar the sanctuary for regular patrons like me. Keep up the great job, Team Astor Bar!
5
One of the best collection of whisky in Singapore plus the new bar promotion make your own g&t is very cool! The service is very good the bartenders are very knowledgeable on what they are doing by giving us good recommendation on their products. The burger was phenomenal very juicy and tasty!
5
Nice Ambience and nice service. Very attentive staff who knows when to come serve you before your glass if empty
5
The cocktails here are fantastic and the music is always on-point! What makes this bar different from others are the staff in it! Excellent service! They are willing to spark up a conversation with anyone.
5
Don’t know where to start, excellent service, awesome drinks and soulful music. I have enjoy every bit of it. Thank ladies and gentleman
5
We had cocktails and beer. Our drinks came with free chips & nuts served in pretty container. Service prompts & pleasant. Not crowded on Sunday evening but also no live jazz music which we came for. Maybe on other evenings. It was nice & we will be back for sure.
5
Everytime i spent my free time at this bar they kept on surprising me with a cool cocktail idea. Make your own g and t is one of the best idea in this bar! The burger is really good too very juicy and appealing. Thanks to all the staff who really took care of me
5
Popped by the very first time this week after work. Ordered mojito from Ron and he makes one of the best mojito I ever tasted! (A pity I forget to take a photo) Special thanks to Ron for being so attentive, will definitely visit again
5
This is my favorite bar anywhere for many reasons. First off, Ron is a genius of an entertainer. He plays the piano, sings and dances and does it all with incredible grace and style - and an amazing voice. One of my friends commented on Facebook after just seeing a lousy phone video I posted that she loves to listen to singers with soul like Ron - high praise, but well deserved.Second, Lorna, one of the servers, is one of the sweetest people I have ever met. She has a friendly and welcoming smile, kind words and a gentle grace about her. Just a minute talking to her while she takes your order or brings it will brighten your whole day. Jo and Margie take care of everyone with charm and care as well.Finally, Imran is one of my three favorite bartenders of all time. And my bar (I couldn’t help myself) is very high as I’m at over 150 nights in hotels on the road this year (an experience I never want to repeat). He makes great drinks, he is very friendly, if you like bourbon, rye or whisky he has an amazing selection and can help you pick some real winners and he can also point you to some great places to eat. Ron is another great bartender who is very friendly, nice and talented. And if you don’t know what to order, try one of their white chocolate martinis - I have a new favorite drink!So there you have it. If TripAdvisor would let me post another review of the St Regis (I just posted one after my stay last month) I would review the whole place, but suffice it to say the the hotel sets the standard for great hotels in Singapore from the incredible breakfast to the beautiful rooms to the pool to the team working at the hotel (that really makes the difference - Barak, Shah, Priscilla, Frerdy, Angel, Chris, Mani, Tau Fiq, Ali, Raheem, the Manager Matthias and others). Staying here and getting to come down to the Astor Bar most nights makes work travel enjoyable and would make a vacation a dream.
5
Very good place to chilling with friends. Staff very helpful and friendly, special thank to Ron, Lorna, Christian, and Juve. Will coming back for them . cheers
5
Went here with my friends and we had an amazing night last Friday. The place was really crowded. I tried their Chicken Wings, it was like the best version of buffalo wings! I also had the Singapore Sling, it was amazingly delicious... The cocktails themselves took a short awhile to arrive, due to it being so busy, but they were 100% worth the wait. Cool space with beautiful wall art display. Atmosphere was casual with live jazz music, the singer was very talented, I enjoyed his acapella performance. The service staff was very welcoming and managed to seat us all together! Cheers! Bonus feature: It's a generally comfortable and fun place to drink whiskey
5
We went on a Friday night at the astor bar and it was super full and didn't realised that theres much of a happening down here we didn't manage to get a table so we stood right in front of the bar , and one of the bartender approaches us and taken our order i had martini which i never had this much of size for a very reasonable price my friend had martini also drinks are wonderful , the live music is perfect not too loud and very entertaining , we had order burger and fries with truffle i would say best burger in town, will surely come and bring my friend in this hidden bar at the end of orchar
5
Great selection of whiskies, including Japanese as well as American bourbons and ryes.Live music makes for a lively atmosphere perfect for pre- or post-dinner drinks. Although with the music, can be a little loud, is also a suitable location for a casual business meeting
5
Visited this bar on my last night of vacation in Singapore. I was only going for a relaxing night but Astor has exceeded my expectations. The ambience of the place and the food and drinks they're serving totally made my visit worth every while. On the top of all these, the good customer service is what makes me want to definitely come back. The staff knows what they are selling and they know how to deliver. Value for money plus excellent location and service equals to best time!
5
Truly one of the best hotel bar in singapore The food was absolutely wonderful the presentation is very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks from their barrel which are aged negroni and old fashioned! As always all the bar staff are very friendly and approachable!
5
After I had a beautiful experience in my last visit I could not resist myself to come back to this place ..when I come this time Mr Christian greet me n make me sit at the bar counter ..I was surprised to know that he still remember my name which makes me more comfortable..I had some drinks n ask him if the wine sommelier Mr Vikines is still around ..after some time he come to meet which makes me feel important..I know he is a very busy person but he took some time for me to recommend some good wine ..this time I tried his personal favourite petit Chablis he Singapore edition .. as per him it’s exclusively only for St regis hotel Singapore .so if one want to try this wine you need to come to st regis ..I really liked the wine it’s very crispy n easy to drink wine ..honestly I m not a white wine person but trust me I loved each n every sip of my wine ..he told me I can find testing notes of citrus like lime n grapefruit n peach flavour ..when I tried it was perfect ..I couldn’t find the peach flavour though but it was ok ..what I like about ASTOR BAR is the personalise service like Mr Christian knows my name ..it’s really make feel important..the other bartender RON also was quite professional n nice to talk with ..no matter how Long how bad or how tiring your day once you come to Astor bar you will forget your whole day stress for a time being which is the main reason why I come to this place ..Mr Christian suggested me their Italian restaurant after my drinks ..I told them for sure next time ..thanks once again RON ,CHRISTIAN N VIKINES to make my evening a beautiful one ..will love to see you guys one more time ..PROST !!
5
I have been to Astor Bar with my friends and I can say that the quality of service is very good...They have a wide array of cocktails to choose from & most of all o felt so comfortable. Overall, my friends & I had an amazing time here.
5
Aside from Picasso's art works on the wall, I really loved the ambiance, the choices of drinks and the staffs! very friendly and accomodating. Drinks are a little bit pricy but worth it! Thanks jo for looking after us, it was a joy meeting you!
5
The food, the drinks, the service everything was perfect.. It was our first time in Singapore and visited this place ending up having a blast.. we loved the ambience and were very impressed by the service and recommendations from Imran for the food and drinks.. Thank you so much for making this experience a memorable one
5
Astor Bar is a good place to chill out with friends. The service staffs are very friendly and cheerful. I will definitely go again and recommend Astor Bar to my friends as well. :
5
Located within the main lobby of the St. Regis Singapore I knew I was in for a rare experience.I visited during a late lazy afternoon in search of their famous scotch and whisky collection. I don’t claim to be an aficionado but, certainly appreciate a fine single malt or single cask whisky. The menu layout made it very simple to understand and explore the various offerings from around the world.All that being said, I settled on their signature cocktail that was invented at the St. Regis, New York back in 1934 by bartender Frenand Petiot, known as the Red Snapper which is now known as a Bloody Mary. It was prepared with Kettle One and garnished appropriately in a lovely crystal glass.The ambiance of the bar is what you would expect of the caliber of hotel. The seating was extremely plush and comfortable. Soft jazz was playing in the background and the staff were extremely personable and friendly.The only downside, I simply didn’t have enough time to enjoy one of the many scotches and whiskies they had to offer. I have every intention to visit Singapore just for the experience
5
One of the best whisky collection in singapore! The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food was really good too! Must try the wagyu burger
5
A good pick if you want to chill with friends, has live band which is inclined with the ambiance of the bar. The staff gave an excellent service and recommendations for drinks and they are very hospitable.  Truly recommendable bar!
5
great ambience, great service, great drinks! the staffs are extremely friendly and the live music adds ip to the great interior of the place
5
Ive been travelling most of my time , i have been in to many places i would say that only few places that really catches my heart and one of those is singapore, st regis - ASTOR BAR, its been a while since i visited this place but “SUPERB” “WOW” the staff still recognises me even what i have drunk from my last visit, you guys really made my day, cocktails are top notch value for money , wagyu burger and satay are few of my favorite food thank you for this wonderful experience surely will see you on my next visit in singapor
5
 Its a good experience to be in astor bar having all those people who makes you feel home. Looking forward on coming back again which i consider my second home. Over all great experience! Well done and cheers
5
Best and wide range of whiskeys, lovely staff and great music ! I especially love how the vibe was ! Would totally recommend this place 
5
This is very classic bar, with design cues from colonial Shanghai. Their live music is good, if a little exuberant on the piano. But their drinks are spectacular. Their Kavalan whiskey sour is dangerously drinkable
5
One of the best cocktail and whisky bar in singapore! The bar staff are all knowledgeable and very friendly! Food are very nice too especially the wagyu beef burger with some crispy bacon and chesse
5
The drinks are great. Highly recommend Satay which tastes delicious. Ron is the go to guy for you if you need something surprisingly good to drink. The musician at the bar is also very good. Try to come here while the music is live.
5
Had a fantastic night here! I would say one of the best live jazz and drink experience I’ve had in Singapore. The bar has a huge selection of whiskies, great wines too! I love their martini glass and their espresso martini is the best I’ve ever had! Add to that, Marg, the friendly bar staff and the barman, just awesome! Worth visiting!
5
This is a great place for a relaxing drink while listening to the piano player. The staff are friendly and extremely courteous. The light food menu is delicious. The art on the walls is interesting
4
Great place and cosy. The piano guy was extremely good and non intrusive to conversations but the cocktails were terrible. Would strongly recommend this bar but select some wine or a simple Gn
5
great bar.. cosy and first time ever.. outstanding hospitality of the staff, live band to make it more romantic ambiance... great drinks and food.. a must visit bar! cheers!
5
Every visit has been an awesome and unforgettable experience. Amazing staff with great drinks to go along with it. Christian, Ron and Imran keep up the great work !
5
The staff at Astor Bar are professional, dedicated and passionate in making their guests feel welcome here. I certainly do. Astor Bar is now my nightly sanctuary after a long and stressful day at work.
5
Great atmosphere, attentive & friendly service... Thank you very much Ron for taking care of me tonight. Definitely will back again!
5
The staffs and service are exceptional! Wonderful place to chillax! Ron and his crews are so attentive and friendly! Me and my friend had a wonderful time to chill here and definitely will come back again.
5
All the good reviews that I have read about this bar are true. The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced in this bar! The cocktails are awesome
5
I was here for 8 nights and pretty much hung out there every night because the staff was so friendly and nice and made my long stay in Singapore so much better! Cheers to this bar! Love them!
5
Very cozy and has a great service to begin with. The staff are very approachable and they serve with a smile! My friends and i are very comfortable while we are having fun with their awesome cocktails made especially by the Bar Manager, Christian Chavez. Plus the amazing music of their very talented pianist and singer. The bar itself is just perfect for everyone just to chill and relax and enjoy. Thumbs up to the really great service and perfect ambiance. One of the most amazing bars in Singapore i must say. Keep it up!
5
The service given by the entire team specially Haket was truly outstanding!!! The ambiance as well as the drinks selection was remarkable...Really excited to visit the place again very soon...Ero
5
From a very Long day at work, this lady name "Jo" if I had it correctly. We enjoyed the selections of whiskey while celebrating my friends birthday. Thank you ASTOR BAR TEAM, For a pleasant service.
5
Great food and ambience for a relaxing night out with friends.There are 2 skillful Bartenders doing their magic behind the counter, either creating fantastic Cocktails from the menu choices, or based on your personal preference of ingredients. The rest of Topiary is fast, nice and just what you expect from an intimate Cocktail bar as well. Highly recommended for a chill night out with friends and business meeting too
5
We had few drinks at astor bar with my friends last thursday. The drinks are amazing the "martinis" are must try. Good entertainment and excellent service! We will definitely come back
5
Very pleasant and cool atmosphere!! Excellent service from the staff all of them are very friendly. Thumbs up to Mr Christian the manager, very knowledgeable he always make it sure that we enjoy our stay at Astor Bar very attentive. One of the best place and bars in Singapore. Amazing drinks and food very affordable.Live music, great singer and musician, you will feel more relax... I always had a great a time at Astor Bar!!!Thank you very much for great experience:

I really enjoyed my stay in singapore with my friends. Definitely, I will come back to AB this coming holiday season. I already missed the place - the ambiance, drinks and food are truly mouth watering
5
Thanks for the experiential purchase. I love the place and for sure will always visit the place. Had so much fun
5
I went with my family at the astor bar i would say we had a great time , great service , wonderful cocktails made by their very own mixologist .... will come back soo
5
We went here just a few days ago with my friends. We love the wide variety of wine and drinks. We enjoy the food specially the soothing music. It is a great place to hang out with friends. They have great staff too. Definitely we'll go back to this place for another vacation
5
These place is a perfect package to get out of the stress. Nice music,good food and top of all pampering treatment by the staff specially by Imran. Looking forward for our next visit with a bigger group. Thanks Sa
5

5
The bar serves usual bar drinks and peanuts, great ambience and good to relax and unwind. The servers are all very nice and polite.
5
Astor bar always has such wonderful drinks and services. Thank you Ron & Imran for their fantastic and exceptional services. Thanks for preparing the best Singapore Sling for me, the Singapore sling is really the best in town, even better than Raffles Hotel. The bar's ambience is really great and nice to have a drink. Really enjoy it
5
Incredibly rich collection the book at the enter an entrance titled '101 Whiskies'. Live music from 6 to 8 pm. However, I found music to be little too loud to have meaningful conversation. Drinks were awesome.
5
Thanks Ron for making my Astor Bar experience great. We'll hope to see you again. You man deserve a raise.

Called and confirmed if there was Jazz but turned out to be just a pianist and singer. Went there at 815 and was told the performance will resume only at 9. The actual thing starts at 910pm and ends at 945pm. I was again told they will at 10pm, but they resume only at 1030pm. Waited more than half an hour for my 2nd round of drinks and decided to cancel my order and get the bill. Waited for yet another half an hour for the bill but to no avail. I walked up to the bar myself and the staff retrieve my bill from a stack pending bill folders. Pianist was just sitting with a group of scantily dressed women with heavy makeup at this table the whole night who look like this own friends more than anything else. Horrible service!!
3
Nice & Quiet Evening away from the hustle & bustle of Orchard Belt.Needed a place to relax after a hectic wee
5
Astor Bar provided a relaxing after-dinner experience where one can sit back, relax, sip a drink of many choices, while listening to live music through the evening. The singing was beautiful by the way. We liked the atmosphere and the choices of drinks on offer.
5
It has been a while since I have had the opportunity to visit the St Regis Astor Bar, so it was reassuring to see the welcome and service levels remain as high as ever. This is a bar for guests who expect the best. The house champagne may have changed, but Imran was as welcoming and convivial as ever
5
Always look forward to visiting the St Regis, Singapore, and in particular the Astor Bar. Ron Sinclair never disappoints with his sublime piano and vocals. Could listen for hours. Add to that great service from friendly staff (most recently Lorna) with smiles on their faces, gives the bar great warmth. Will definitely visit again when next in Singapore
5
Ron the Barman mixes the best dirty Martini in Singapore!!!A great whiskey bar with live music and lots of atmosphere.
5
I was wandering around on a humid Saturday and got lost, i saw the St. Regis and was sure i could go and relax and take my marks back. Went to the Astor bar right at the hotel's entrance. Took some glasses of champagne and chatted to Miss Som who could give me some info and hints about the city. This short encounter was very enjoyable, superb surroundings. Thank you Miss Som for your kind help and professional service
5
To the right of the entrance of St Regis this bar has live music mainly a black man who sings and plays the piano. Its Singapore Sling is apparently excellent according to my friend.It has a good champagne cocktail list. I tried Royal Exquise and Champagne Cocktails, both excellent.A place off Tanglin Road worth returning
4
Service is definitely good here - I stopped in many times during my stay at the hotel and was always pleased with service. The prices are steep and the entertainment choices are strange - they would've been better with no one vs. the man we saw one evening
5
Small bar with old-world atmosphere. Live music the few nights I was there. Professional, sophisticate crowd
4
Tried a few cocktails. Some better than others. Wouldn't go there for the drinks alone but the ambiance
4
Met here with the team on multiple occasions to wind down and review the day open late is a very high end hotel on Tangli
5
Looking for a respite from the stressful day, my friends and I dropped by and we were not disappointed. The ambiance was relaxing as well as the great live music. But what won us over was the way we were taken care of the staff. Thank you to Joyce for ensuring that our glasses were filled with the very best that Astor Bar had to offer. We had an amazing night
5
When my friend and I walked pass by the lobby at the St. Regis Singapore, we heard the live song which was so nice, so we went in there and think that we made the right choice. Nice singer, who can entertain guests to pay attention on him. Cocktails and wine are nice.
5
They offer higher end wines by the glass. Very upscale atmosphere. Live music was very relaxing. I enjoyed dinner in the Astor Bar several evenings during my stay
5
Very good young Indian bartender looking after us. Music is excellent and the bar had a good vibe! Only downside is the price tag at the end of the night; drinks are very expensive
5
Fantastic drinks menu and wonderful snack menu, the staff are excellent and the live entertainment was an added bonus
1
Positive aspect of this bar is obviously the cosy interior. But this is it already. We went with the expectation of having drinks accompanied by live jazz or blues music. Then the resident singer started his "performance". I was shocked. This resident pianist singer Ron Sinclair provides terrible piano music which is not even a little bit close to jazz music at all. Boring boring boring and bad singer. You would expect that in a shopping mall elevator but not in a "jazz" bar. Actually one of worst experiences I have ever made in any Singapore bar. Avoid that place! Wodka Tonic is SGD23++ ... couldn't finish it quick enough to disappear. We won't come back, not even for free drinks unless you come up with real jazz music. If you don't know what jazz music sounds like ... google helps.
5
Fantastic ambience, old world luxury. Extensive bar menu and a good range of light meals. We enjoyed the Prawns with mango salad and Satay Chicken as a quick but filling meal with a drink before a late flight. A talented pianist played and sang at a comfortable volume while we enjoyed our drinks and free snacks of pretzels, nuts and crisps. Great place to relax and enjoy a drink, highly recommend. Also well priced
4
Access to the bar from the street is on the right hand side as you enter the St Regis. The bar is cosy and well appointed. But it's greatest asset is the lounge musician. He is a very talented performer and easy to listen to while the world passes you by. We had only 1 unpleasant experience during our stay with a group of loud and obnoxious patrons who had certainly imbibed enough such that the comfort of the hotel guests was made uncomfortable. Further I was at a loss to understand how the hotel sanctioned a young child being in the bar who was obviously with her mother in the group, witnessing such inappropriate adult behaviour. I applaud Kris and his staff but when a 5 star hotel has to mobilise security then perhaps they need to rethink the rules of the bar.
3
Chili Padi Mary is a must try for the adventurous while in St. Regis Singapore. If Chili Padi Mary isn't your thing, you can order from a selection of Bloody Mary's that St. Regis has perfected throughout the years. The jazz performers are quite an entertaining lot, you'd hear them perform as you enter the hotel
5
Relaxing, quiet and with good live music. Both days we stayed at the hotel we dropped in at the bar as it was so inviting. The waitress went out of her way to get us food from room service as it was late for the restaurants
5
Came here for lunch and the bar which was recommended by a friend. Ambiance was really awesome and friendly staff... me and my husband ordered the famous Red Snapper Bloody Mary cocktail, a beer and Wagyu beef Burger, It was the best Bloody Mary in town, and they have got a fantastic cocktails selection as well which we will definitely try on our next visit. Thank very much and we'll see you again!!!!
4
There's live music here. Usually a Filipino band. Prices are what you'd expect from a St Regis - which is high. The drinks are ok. It's quite a cosy and quiet bar. You can have conversations here.
4
Used this bar a couple of time where the service is friendly and efficient. Enjoyed cocktails here. Piano music in an evening too. Not cheap thoug
5
good food, drinks and atmosphere.......what else do you want? a nice selection of wine, and live music.
4
Waiting for a dinner reservation and friend, I sat in this restaurant for an hour before my meal and then retired here afterwards.The bar man was friendly even though far busier than you might imagine for a half full bar. The atmosphere was nice, but not as intimate as I had hoped. The drinks priced fairly much as you would expect from such a place. I chose this place for the reviews that placed it as one of the top jazz cafes in Singapore. Whilst the music before my dinner was pleasant, the same singer, somewhat louder this time (a little intrusively so) was disappointing after dinner (both in selection and execution of her repertoire). Whilst it might be a pleasant place to meet for a drink with friends (although the music too loud if you want lengthy discussions), I would be hard pressed to recommend it for the music that evening
4
Nice cozy place for a drink, there is a Jazz piano player if you come late enough. Supper Club members enjoy a good discount (making the drinks reasonably priced)
5
The Astor Bar at the St Regis, offers a sophisticated and elegant environment for lunch, cocktails and after work drinks. What sets this bar apart is the genuinely warm welcome and friendly service. Live music, in the evening, enhances the intimate atmosphere. Christian, Imran and the team always ensure that guests have an enjoyable time. I would recommend that you drop by when you are in town
4
Went Astor Bar during lunch where there is no guests.Shortly after getting a seat, ordered a coffee and margarita.Coffee is good. Margarita is normal.Service is good
5
I did enjoy a calm time in a relaxed atmosphere bar. I took a few glasses of champagne. Please visit with a good partner or friend and enjoy the time
3
The only real bar at St Regis, deep fried snacks, lacklustre entertainment. The cocktails were nice there, Lychee Martini, it really is a corporate hotel bar. Some time back they had a happy hour here for hotel guests which did give it a bit of life, appears that has stopped now and as such this is quite cold, not especially intimate and become corporate...not for me thank yo
4
This place was a great place to relax after the heat in Singapore. They make a great long island ice tea it gets you going :) Great place to cool down and just enjoy a few nice drinks and watch the night run away :)
2
I have stayed at this hotel for many nights now+decor is cool+wine was bad when i had it+music was too loud and singer not sure top choic
4
Thank you for Mr. Christian, Ms. Jaquelyn and Mr. Imran for their hospitality and good service. We very enjoyed our drinks there. However, the male singer always performs same song list and dancing at the Astor Bar entrance. It is quite boring for regular guests and sometimes the way he sings is not considered performance but more to disrupt our conversation with his loud voice. We can only talk until he finishes singing. Nowadays, guests with short pants are allowed to enter such nice place, I think the management should do something. You will never ever see a gentleman with a short pants drinking in St. Regis New York - old king cole bar. Come on St Regis Singapore, no more dress code??!
5
highly recommended bar at the st. regis singapore ! super cocktails, live music; good device, music occasionally a bit loud
4
I was staggered to see that The Astor bar, with its cool jazz piano tinkling in the background that the walls of the cosy wood panelled room with its leather club chairs were covered in Picassos, drawings and paintings, mainly before he turned to cubism. That was really special room in which to enjoy a drink.
5
The title says it all. The Astor bar at the St. Regis makes a dry gin martini the way you might make one at home for yourself and your best friends. A pair of these sets you back $56.50SD, which isn't bad considering you're in a classy hotel bar. There is also live music, although I'm not a fan of that sort of thing. Nonetheless, the service was great and the drinks hit the spot. I think a perfect night out would be to have a drink at the Astor Bar, then walk up the street to have a steak at Dan Ryan's Grill (Dan's is a little less swank than the Astor's St. Regis hotel, but they make a good steak for a reasonable price that will leave you with extra funds for a cab home).
5
Like the hotel the Astor bar has amazing staff that will attend to all of your needs. Additionally the bar has live music everyday in the afternoons/early evenings
5
My girlfriend and I went to astor bar to celebrate our anniversary, they're currently full that time. The astor bar staff are very helpful, they managed to get us table , the service was so fantastic, though they're all busy they can still assist and served us every now and then.The drinks and food was lovely and as well as the music, had an amazing night , we really enjoyed our night .To all the astor bar staff , keep up the good work 
5
I visited astor bar with my friend for celebrate her birthdayAll the staff was so kind to us and they sang a birthday son for her and they gave birthday cake as well it was so wonderful experienc
5
Popped in for a drink and relax daily when staying at the St. Regis in Singapore. Loved the live music from 6 and indulged in just a few martinis during my stay.Great ambiance and definitely a good spot to unwind from the heat and humidity at the end of the day
5
A lovely find at the St. Regis hotel. Do try the cucumber martinis.Lovely setting and the live jazz (as I sit and type) is fabulous
5
If you are looking for somewhere to go on a lazy Sunday evening, then look no further. It is a welcome respite from the shopping hustle and bustle of Orchard, with an 'old school' feel, hotel bar with attentive service and amazing cocktails, while listening to the amazing voice of Myra. The team in the bar, headed up by Christian are very engaging and welcoming and always there to encourage "One more?" is always an option. We tried to leave twice, signing the bill, only to order another drink saying "last song! We leave after this one"

This place is fantastic - I'm not sure if they have a pianist and singer every night, but the night we went, they did, and they were awesome! It really adds to the ambiance of the bar. The drinks are delicious and adequately priced (for where you are) the Bloody Mary is a must, as that itself is a tradition. The apple martini is great also - they also do cocktails, off-list, so do ask what the barman is able to make :

Old club feel and bustling atmosphere. Can get a little crowded at times but nice in evenings through till late. Good bartender for cocktail mixing.

We seemed to obtain our very own barman and waitress who worked together to keep us served at all times. Thanks to Ron and Jaquelyn. They laughed and joked with us all night.This place is outstanding ! The service is perfect, the cocktails at the bar are really tasty, made with fresh ingredients. Highly recommended

The St. Regis certainly catches unknowing travellers...as a Singapore resident, we can say this is probably the worst bar experience in 3 years. From the terrible piano music, the lack lustre/daggy feel to thimbles of wine at more than $50 a pour, we could recommend this bar to no-one. Would have preferred 10 cocktails at Catalunya for what we paid! Beware!

We had the best night of our trip in this Bar. We were staying at the St Regis and decided to pop into their bar for a late dinner and drinks. The meals were delightful (the Hainanan Chicken was 10/10), the cocktails menu was extensive (fancy a blue cheese martini anyone), and the waiters would tailor to anything you fancy, mixing us cocktails that werent on the menu, and giving the wonderfully talented live music singer our song requests. The staff and ambience made for a night not to be forgotten and we are very thankful to them all for making our night so special. Thank you

This bar was a very last minute decision, very close to the hotel I was staying at. I was not disappointed as they had very polite service staff and an extensive wine list. I would recommend this bar for a quiet evening entertaining friends or clients. Chicken wings are excellent to go with the single malt

The drinks, atmosphere, staff and music were fantastic! It was a great experience overall and will definitely be returning here soon

I always go to Astor Bar I've always get a great service but me and few of my friends visited the bar, I'm surprised to the service I've got from the staff it's unrefined and impolite.... Didn't expect this at all because there's a two girls there before who always serve me and recognize me but unfortunately they are not there anymore I didn't see both of them... This two ladies always smile and talk to us.. They have impeccable service. But the guy who serve me was terribly bad "indian"!!!!! Won't be back to this bar anymore. If you could find the same ladies that you had before that would be a great help on your bar rather than taking this Indian guy

What a wonderful bar this was to visit. This was our first visit to the iconic St Regis Singapore and we had the pleasure of meeting with a couple of friends there during our visit. The service was exceptional and the drinks were nothing but the best. My wife loved the Bloody Mary and my favourite was the Chilli Mary with that extra bit of a kick! Then onto an excellent bottle of Malbec served perfectly. The music was great and nicely in the background so you can enjoy your conversation along with the great atmosphere of this lovely bar. We will definietly be visiting again when are next in Singapore and would recommend it to anyone wanting a special experience
