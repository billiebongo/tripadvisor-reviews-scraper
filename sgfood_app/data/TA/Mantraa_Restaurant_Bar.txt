Went there with friends for dinner. We had the best fried rice and "panner" (cottage cheese)..My girlfriend's favorite chicken 65. I say it's world class as both my friends from Italy and Spain liked their curries very much. Had few drinks later that night and we enjoyed the ambience listening to some good music.Only few steps away from Mustafa Center. You guys out there should try this one out whenever you find yourself craving for Indian dish in the middle of Little India
