This was next to our hotel so handy for a few drinks, we stopped by at the end of the night and it was still lively at 3 am . Good drink deals during weekday evenings

Good little bar for being able to watch the football outside. Food in Japanese section of menu is superb and served by good attentive staff. Generally good beer offers on during the week

Only one white and one red wine on offer??....really could offer more selection. Friendly staff. Goid location.

.Peak times can be busyOff peak is pretty dull and the place is deserted.Several staff are attentive, others are consistently disinterested.When staff cluster together to gossip, and it is difficult to get service, there is a management failure.When food is delivered cold, it adds to the frustration.So, my visits here are now getting fewer.

Decent selection of whiskeys at moderate prices. Food can be ordered from kitchen shared with Japanese restaurant next door which means a whole lot of pretty decent Jap dishes are available. Plus some western type fare. Tried a few dishes over couple of viists incl Yakitori, noodles etc. Good stuff

Average selection of beers however cheap by Singapore standards. A pint of IPA is S$12 nett during happy hour (all day Sunday) and S$14 outside. Freezing cold inside the bar however it is possible to sit outside under a big roof, which is quite pleasant. Only a single toilet so don't leave it to the last minute or use the toilets in the mall next door.Didn't try the food.

A nice enough place for a drink or two outdoors under the fans down Cuppage Terrace, particularly for happy hour in tge late afternoon when the drinks prices are more reasonable. The bar stays open late until 3am or 4am in the weekends for night owls

I recently frequented the aforementioned establishment upon which a solicitation was made for an alcoholic beverage and a pizza. The visitation was made with my spouse and adolescent dependents. We proceeded to be served the most pathetic excuse for a pizza I have ever experienced. After waiting over 20 mins we were served a pizza the size of a small dinner plate. My four old son would have eaten it in its entirety if it hadn't been for his ravenous 8 year old sister who dared to share the pizza with him. Hands down the worst 16 SGD or foreign currency equivalent I have spent in my life at a purveyor of food and drink. In my shock and exacerbation at what was delivered to the table I questioned the waitress on the insignificance of the sustenance. I was met with a number of dismissive guttural sounds which I found both obnoxious and rude. If you have a requirement for provisions to accompany your consumption of alcoholic potable liquid then I would suggest an alternative venue as the meagre rations are highly unlikely to provide the necessitated satisfactions. This is indeed a shame as the beverage which I petitioned was of a superlative standard (Summer IPA) in comparison to the miserably inadequate mass market beer offerings typically available in Singapore

We had drinks over a couple of nights at this bar and considering the price of drinks in Singapore it was quite economical. The stools inside the bar are uncomfortable but if you sit outside at the tables it is quite pleasant. We did not have a meal here as we served one served and it was just chicken wings on a plate and nothing else.John & Gail Lane

We stopped here a couple of times for a beer on the way back to our hotel. The wine was also nice and very nicely chilled. It is a good place to relax, watch the world go by and have a cold drink. Staff were great. Didn't eat here so can't comment on the food but have been here in the past and will do so again

Visited a couple times as very close to our hotel. You can sit in(which is air conditioned) or out. They sell s large array of alcoholic drinks and a small menu of food. Fantastic atmosphere,

This place is relatively empty most of the time. Really great space to chill out. Been here multiple times.

After dinner at Tamaya, the Japanese restaurant nearby, our group quite appropriately went across to Cable Car for post-dinner drinks, and specifically Japanese whisky. We weren't disappointed at all. The service was decent, and the drinks made the evening a memorable one

This is a very popular bar and restaurant. Friendly staff, who are always busy. Food fairly standard bar food snacks, but will serve Japanese Food from next door. Toilets are a let down though - needs upgraded

Had personal pizza- very thin crust style, liked the spicy chile and sausage version with hot sauce. The teriyaki version had seaweed strips that were a bit salty and unexpected- would have asked to skip those if I knew they were going on.

Went to cable car bar after not having been in years as we like their very cold beer. It is cute and represents a bit of what people think a San Francisco bar might look like. It was early in the afternoon, so quite empty. They have a good selection of drinks, service was ok, but not overly friendly. It is an ok place to stop at for a drink...

Wow. These guys really know how to alienate customers. I'm in Singapore fairly often and have walked by this place a few times. Finally decided to give it a try on a recent Wednesday evening, looking for a quiet beer before dinner. It was not at all crowded and now I know why. They had a couple of varieties of the local Archipelago beer on the menu -- one of my favourites -- along with about 10 other beers. But when I ordered an Archipelago, turns out they actually only have Tiger on draft, and Asahi in bottles. Strike 1.Drank ip quickly and ready to pay up, they tell me they take credit cards only for amounts > $25. Strike 2!!Wifi took forever to connect. Grotty toilets too. Strikes 2.5 and 3!!!Give it a miss. There are LOTS of better options in the area.

I was here for a very short time but at a very odd time. Landed around 1 AM on a Saturday after my hotel bartender told me that on Cuppage Terrace, this is the only place that's open till late (he meant 4 AM) and has good music, drinks, food etc.Ordered for a Rose based Prosecco Cocktail. This was very good. The bar in itself has a nice old world mellow theme with cable car pictures and memorabilia on the walls. I then went on to order another Prosecco drink which was also very good.If on Cuppage Terrace and in need of a quiet mellow time with friends over soothing music (from 90s), good cocktail and decent food, head to this place. You won't be disappointed for sure

Been here many times before and usually ok. Went last night for quick burger and the burger bun tasted mouldy. I requested a fresh one and by the time it came the burger and fries were cold. So I asked for them to be heated. It came back and the second burger bun also tasted mouldy and the fries were cold!!!

Good beer and cold, price maybe more than you normally pay but the bar is open until 0400 in the morning and they serve food, pizza is very good. Just remember the small stores/carry out, 7-11's stop selling booze at 1930, new law since April 15
