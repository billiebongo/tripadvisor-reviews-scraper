This place always has a long queue if you come during meal times. It used to be very nice but standard has dropped drastically. Won't be back in a long time.

Food here is decent, in particular the fish soup here. Hence it can get pretty packed, and with that, some questionable (rude service), and higher prices. Would probably go elsewhere next time.

We went to their Blk 107 Hougang Ave 1 branch. Soup was really good but definitely cut throat pricing for like 6 pieces of fish in the steamboat? No wonder not many tables order steamboat but instead mostly order it in a bowl!!!!!

They shouldn't accept reservation on weekends.
Long queue as priority goes to reservation customers while walk-ins have to wait.
Believed they are using frozen fish for fried fish soup.
Not worth the wait.

This place if you don't book and order in advance, you will be left waiting in the queue for a very long time. The food is serve very fast when you have pre-ordered what you want.Ambience is ok and a bit squeezy as its quite a small place and hence it would be good if they could expand for more seating capacity.Food served is great and tasty. Love the sweet and tasty broth as they use the fish and cabbage as base.The fried shrimp paste chicken was nicely done, the spare ribs was great and the yam ring was excellent.Price is also reasonable priced and service was quite fast. Good place for a traditional charcoal steamboat

Iâ€™m ordered fish soup with bee hoon and shrimp paste fried chicken. The soup taste so so, however my friend ordered with milk , the taste was much more better. Highly recommended add milk to the soup. The location is easy find, take mrt to Bugis station, exit D. The shop is opposite Bugis Junction

I stumbled upon this restaurant purely by coincidence. Never browsed for restaurants let alone read reviews.But this quaint little old-fasioned seafood resto caught my eye when I was passing by from Bugis street to get to the Singapore Flyer.If it weren't for my travel partner's persistence in revisiting this location out of pure curiosity of the long queue outside... I would've never experienced fish on milk .I personally hate queuing for food. Nothing could be more lame than this sordid activity (so says my brain for the umpteenth time) but our time in queue was cut short because a seat for 3 just opened up. Most of the people who come here to dine come in groups of 5 and more (the indonesian travellers next to our table waited far longer to get all 11 people at the one table. Noisy crowd indeed).The Order came along in about 15 mins and after snapping some shots of the dishes, we were happily digging into the meals.I must admit, this was my first time having tasted Fish with Milk.The thought never crossed my mind and I was no big fan of fish soup.The size of the servings were quite a stomach-ful and for me, taking things slowly was the sure way to go. The soup was delightful and made me feel all warm inside. Despite the large and noisy crowd, I somehow felt all those ambient noise drowned out by the divine flavour that was dancing on my tastebuds. I've always eaten slowly and this time round my friends followed my slow rhythm as we savoured the milky fish servings.The price was moderate to high and I feel it was worthwhile.The menu set is quite comprehensive with an abundance of choice, the cleanliness is up-to-par with more modern dining joints.This is why I love spontaneous discovery of places to meet and eat. You never know of the wonderful surprises that awaits.If you love fish... thish ish definitely a plashe to shtop by

Queued for about 25mins even though we arrived at 8pm. Ordered the fried fish soup (one of their signatures), curry fish slices & fried eggs. The curry fish is surprisingly good and we like it a lot. Fish soup is not bad though have tried similar good but cheaper ones elsewhere. Itâ€™s a busy place & the queue can be a turn-off. Price is average, overall itâ€™s a zi-char experience in an air-conditioned restaurant

Got a table for 4 at 11.45 am without waiting. The line started forming at 12 noon. This place is suppose to be famous for the slice fished bee hood. Most of the diners ordered this dish. This dish is good but not the best I have tried.The other dishes we ordered like the salted egg chicken and the pork spare ribs were not up to standard. The pickled radish bean curd and French Bean with dry shrimp were good. I will not come here if I have to line up to get in

One of the better fish soup in Singapore. The soup is flavorful and full of quality. Fish is also fresh and delicious. The only downside is the place tends to be crowded and queues are expected. Come after 9 to avoid the queue. The curry fishhead looks delicious but I've never tried. Price-wise is affordable for the quality. Popular especially with locals for an authentic experience.

If you're looking for the best local food delight especially hokien mee & fish soup you shouldn't miss this place. The food is super yummy. But dont go there during 12-2 because its super crowded since people are really queing just to eat at this place. So love the food here

It is the far most best fish soup & hor fun I had in this area. It is always very crowed with lunch crowds. The best time to order is after the lunch timing so the waiting were not be that long.Overall, I would recommend my friends if they want to have fish soup in that area

I ordered fresh fish Mee Hoon,the soup is tasty, but the fish is not, and the service is really really bad, the waitress is not friendly to the customer who comes alone at all, they only welcome the group because they will order more. Will not come back again. And I think the food is really not worth that long waiting.

We went at almost 8pm on a Saturday evening and it was crowded. The food was served timely. The serving for the rice was big. There was still balance when 4 bowls of rice were shared among 4 adults and 2 young children.We ordered fish for the steamboat and not fish head as we have young children. There was a lot of fish meat and we were not able to finish. We also ordered a plate of vegetables and omelette. The omelette with Char Siew was tasty. Vegetables ok. Fish steamboat soup was tasty but fish is not tasty. They can top up the soup. I can't remember the total price. Only cash or Nets allowed. Overall, average

We stood in queue for 30 min before we were settled with a table. We had a hearty dinner with curry fish head, cereal calamari, marmite pork ribs and two veg dishes. It was full house and the place was noisy. But I guess this place is worth a return visit as the food is delicious at a reasonable price. We were told that reservation at this place can be taken if it is a steamboat meal. I think this is a good tip and will save the hassle of having to stand in line.

Hidden in a small corner shop adjacent to a coffee shop in Lorong halus is this little Zi Ca stall called Xin Yuan Ji. If you find it very familiar, its because there's another outlet located in Bugis and they've been around for quite some time. They are famous for their sliced and fried fish soup bee hoon which is something i love quite a bit. Their sliced fish soup bee hoon ($5.80) is still my favorite after many years. The soup is salty, sweet with the taste of fish and tastes good whether you add milk to it or not. The serving size is generous and i like the thin bee hoon they use which does not souk up the soup too quickly yet manages to have enough flavor to tempt you back again. Like i said, i enjoy their fish soup a lot.This post is about a recent visit to eat their full blown zi ca offerings and you can see what we ordered above.The salted egg chicken tasted great although the serving size is a tad too little for the price. The cereal prawn is to die for because the way they mixed the cereal and possibly milk powder is done so well, it is the most fragrant cereal prawn i've had yet. That was the star of the day.The most expensive dish was the fish head steamboat which is made using grouper and i have to say we were all quite disappointed as the soup itself, which is the most important factor to me, did not come across as good as the soup used in their smaller sliced fish bee hoon offerings. The kang kong is normal and the coffee pork ribs were pretty run of the mill.As a conclusion, this meal was still decent and i would recommend ordering the cereal prawns and a good bowl of sliced fish bee hoon during your visit for the most enjoyment

Long queue but worth the little wait. Steamboat of red garoupa, soup with a hint of Chinese "dong guay", with tomatoes and lemongrass, refreshing. For The individual soup noodles, you can request adding milk, which tastes very good and smooth. Deep fried chicken with chilli sauce, the flour isn't too thick, taste is great. Good to go with a beer or their signature drink "mama", a plum drink, tastes sweet and sour... i love it.Fried baby kai lan is another fantastic dish that I'd like to order the 2nd round

If you are looking for a good curry fish head, look no further than this restaurant. The curry fish head is good - Assam Curry Fish Head.

Very busy place for fish soup. As we wanted rice, we opted for zi char dishes instead of sweet sour pork, vege and egg. Good portions and tasty. Price a bit on the high side being in the city. Our barley drinks came late, only after reminding them

This was the first time I try this restaurant and it took 25 mins to wait on weekday night. Some of the dishes are special such as coffee pork rib, fried squid with salty egg and the spicy fish bowl which I have never try before. The food quality is good and value of money. Definitely will try other dishes in my next visit

Have been wanting to go to this place for lunch but always discouraged by the constant long queue outside in the sun during lunch time. Finally made it today by having an early lunch (door opens at 11.30am). Order can be taken while in the queue. But still a long wait after seated. When the food arrived, all was forgiven. We ordered simple fish soup with noodle, and it was delicious. It may not look great but the flavour was awesome. Just wish there's more seating area so that it's not always such a long wait.

Looked for a quick dinner and decided to go to this place as the queue was not very long. Service was 'ehmmm yah' and not able to speak Mandarin made it even worse. Ordered the fish soup, salted egg rib, fried veggie and ice tea......ok who needs friendly waitresses when the food is this yummy! I just pulled up my cocoon, digged in and paid

Delicacy. My family, my friends all love this restaurant very much. We have tried a lot of delicious dishes and never disappointing us ,they still maintain the standard all the time. Our favorite dishes are curry fish head, sambal squid, fish soup , steamboat , Stir-Fried Lettuce with Fermented Bean Curd... Always long queue in front this restaurant. To avoid the queue ,please come before 5.30pm. if not you have to wait at least 30min to 1 hour but We willing to queue for 30min to 1hour for this too

The food is generally not bad but it's up to you to decide if it is worth the wait. The wait for a seat and the duration of each dish being served.I guessed the are catering more to aka carte but if you were to have a family meal, you might have to wait 20 - 30 minutes between dishes.Personally, the food is fair but the wait just ain't worth it

Came with my sister and her baby on a week day around 2pm for lunch, the place was busy but still had a few tables empty. You can tell that during normal lunch/dinner hours this place is packed, so if you don't like waiting, definitely shoot for off peak hours.Had fish noodle soup with milk (strange but it tastes great!) and bitter melon (to combat the heat), salt pepper fried squid (extremely addictive), and garlic Kai lan (green leafy veggie), along with 2 glasses of warm barley water (the real deal, not some cheap imitation). Came to about SG$32.So you can get the same dishes at hawker centers for less, but given the location and the existence of AC, it's worth it eating delicious fish soup while not sweating to death and downgrading your experience.And afterwards, we still had room for dessert

If you like seafood cuisine, this restaurant is worth to visit. I personally often ordered fish soup (broth better if added milk). My advice try other types of foods as well, such as juanlo, and other seafood dishes. In my sense, almost all of the food on offer was delicious.Please prepared your self for long queuing if you want to eat at this place, because the place is very limited and so many visitors. But the good things is when you still queuing, one of the staff will help us make order in advanced, so that when our place is available, our order does not have to wait long
