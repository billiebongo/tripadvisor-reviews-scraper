Portions are just right. Tastes are great. Service attentive and helpful. Unusual combinations for foods but works perfectly together.

Quite small portions so make sure to order side dishes. Some very nice wines on offer. The curry can be quite spicy.

Great food with great service! Super attentive staff and a mix of local and French cuisine for you to choose from.

Food was very nice- I had the lamb chop with satay marinade. Ordering one main for dinner was not enough to fill my stomach though, so I would definitely recommend ordering a side of some sort.

The set lunch was very disappointing. The food does not bear the standard that I expect.
The salmon was over cooked and the egg was nothing special.

The ambience is perfect for small group gathering to enjoy good food and great company. Wine + Dinner = Winner!

This was the 3rd visit for us because we were impressed with the service attention and most of all with the food and pricing. Each item on the menu were priced well below equivalent quality places, especially compared to another 'reputable' restaurant some doors down, serving sizes were decent, and the food was better too. Wine selection was good and you can get a good wine from $65 upwards. However on this visit some things changed. Service attention dropped and it took a long time to get our meals ordered. Also took a long time for our wine to arrive. We decided on the Degustation set which is omakase and menu-less. Turned out most of the dishes were from the menu anyway but maybe in smaller servings. Some of the dishes were still good like the soufflé which entailed a normal 15 minutes wait. We found the lobster pasta way too salty although the pasta was done just al'dente right, lobster serving decent, and the broth tasty. Once the food started coming, the pacing was good and service attention improved. Would we go back again? ..... probably..... if just to check whether this visits' negatives were a one-off

Chanced upon Grignoter whilst looking at Google Maps for a hair salon in Keong Siak Street and what a find it was (Grignoter that is). Refine French cooking with none of the heavily roux thickened sauces that some chefs find appealing.We had the set lunch and the portion size was just right. The duck foie gras with mushrooms was luxuriously coated with a buttery sauce yet light. Baramundi was out for the day but the alternative fish was just as delicious. The base of veggies was classical French, again without the weight. My sambal prawn capellini was delightful. Right amount of kick without it being overpowering. Dessert was a show stopper with a quinelle of Java Melaka which is a intense version of the supermarket variety of palm sugar.Will definitely be back for more. Thank you Chef Justin for a great meal

We were there to celebrate my best buddies's bday. There were 9 of us with varying needs. Everyone in the restaurant was very attentive to our needs. It was a nice touch of a soufflé with a candle prepared by chef. Birthday boy loves the place so much that he plans to return for a private dining soon.

This is my second visit to Grignoter and undoubtedly, it's got a great vibe of charming gem. I have tried their executive lunch and it was good, but it wasn't amazing. Presentation of the first course was very dull and I think they could done better to emphasize the seared foie gras. My main was grilled sea bream and it was fresh but it was bland, though the presentation was much better. Service was nice but I wish they offered more recommendation, offered to order bread (will be charged, but why not) but none happened. Wine I had on my previous visit was still great and our table had a bottle. The dessert was equally boring small scoop of vanilla ice cream. With this low price, hard to ask for more, but I rather pay more to have a great lunch than limit myself for $29. Disappointing lunch, to be honest. Such a lovely place, it could do better

The food was good. I enjoyed how fresh the produce was. The ambience of the place was pleasant and the tables are not too close.

Went there to celebrate friend's birthday. Nice ambience, good food and wine, excellent service, what more can we ask for? I personally prefer the small plates to the main dishes, very unique and delicious! We had a very enjoyable evening.

Enjoyed their Sakura chicken and grain fed Angus. Service was excellent and so was the wine selection. Payments was thru a revolutionary biometric system called Touchè.

Felt like a VIP the second I stepped into the place. Chef Justin greeted me and the manager Eric welcomed me with recommendations and a complimentary drink. The food were fantastic with a good mix between Asian and French that includes ingredients that are unique like edible flowers, etc.A must try is their desserts as they have a good range of great desserts prepared in front of you at the bar counter.The best part is that their prices are really great value for money

Choosing the dishes was the hardest part here. Choosing between fluffy scrambled eggs with caviar, sauteed French duck foie gras, baby spinach leaves, charcoal grileld mushrooms, 'madame langlet' croque monsieur, soupe au pistou or similar dishes for a starter is not easy. Same for the mains unless you want to avoid stress and go for the charcoal grilled steak frites of course. So we had prawn curry from the menu (excellent but unfortunately only three prawns so we had to stuff ourselves with bread), and the rest were temporary specials on a separate menu. For dessert we had the JQ floating island which was OK and the "my favourite fresh vanilla pods crème brulée" which didn't taste different at all from the many others we've had in Singapore. And the portion was a bit tiny, but at least the taste was good. All in all not bad but not many things on the menu that we really like or that we would like to order again, so won't visit this one again I'm afraid

We just went by the restaurant on a Thursday evening, not knowing what to expect, but we were so glad we chanced upon the restaurant! The seasonable seared scallop with Jerusalem artichoke and a delicate truffle cream sauce went so well together. You must try the Chocolate Mint Soufflé which was the highlight of the night. Light and airy, with gentle notes of mint without overpowering the texture of every bite. We would go back just for this!! Great service and we would love to be back.

Was invited to Chef Justin Quek's latest resto and was blown away by the food. Amazing experience with Chef Justin's usual attention to detail and service. Fantastic wine list. Ended the evening with food coma but must return to have another round with less whiskey and champagne beforehand. Will be back very soon for sure

We wanted a place for a special dinner and were recommended by friends to go here. It did not disappoint. The service was really, really good and the waiter was only to happy to answer questions about the menu and he did it with knowledge and passion. The restaurant filled up very quickly and is a 'people watching' place. I had the tenderloin which was very tasty, but a little chewy. My husband had the ragu and loved it. The food and wine prices were reasonable for Singapore. We left feeling that we had, had a special night and would go back again

Not heard of this restaurant before and booked last minute while enroute . Lucky they had a table for us. Menu comprised of selection of small plates/tapas so it was perfect to order a few to share. We ordered 7 dishes and 1 dessert. Everything was really awesome but I have to say 5 out of the 7 were outstanding! The veal was top of my list. The chocolate and mint soufflé was amazing. Huge selection of red wines. Service was really good. Ambiance was cosy.

We had a light wine & tapas diner at Grignoter. Wine by the glass selection was nice and well priced. But 2 glasses = 1 anywhere else...Tried the famous croque Monsieur, good but not so special (wouldncall it a "tartine" actually).Tomatoes an parmesan salad was really pretty but not properly seasonned, and parmesan ice cream brought nothing to the plate. My husband would have loved his creme brulée if the custard layer had been a bit thicker. It was so thin, it ruined the experience as it was far too sugary.Place was half empty but despite that, service was a little overwhelmed.In a nutshell, we were attracted by the concept, set up and menu promises, but disappointed by our experience.Unlucky ? or improvements needed to keep up the good ratings I believe

Only place on Teck Lim Rd open on the hot afternoon before Chinese New Year. Great homemade sodas, salad, and pate tapas.

The set lunch was tasty. The seafood risotto is very nicely done. But the steak is not that great a bit too dry

It wasn't as great as we thought it was - food was average. A little over-hyped. Service was good though.

Friendly staffs. Food is good. Bordeaux Theme. I like the French music. There's cozy corner for couples or business meeting. Bar seats perfect for friends or solo for drinks and tapas.

Was introduced to Justin's tapas place by a friend. Its simply divine! From the carefully curated menu by Justin and his chefs, to the exquisite wine selections and the impeccably dedicated service staffs who are absolutely passionate about the place! A homey experience with folks who are serious about their food, wine and making it an enjoyable experience for every diner.

The Bordeaux wines here have great value. The tapas were all so yummy, my favourite are the chicken liver, fresh oysters and "kung bag bao". Everything were very good, the servers were very patient to explain the specialities to us. Truly a place that's of great food, wines and experience. So proud of Justin Quek!'
