Decent food, clean environment and very nice staff except the corkage is pretty high. Just few minutes walk away from our hotel so we went twice. Highly recommend:)
4
Stunning interiors with Art Deco interiors. Food is actually quite good and consistent, Chinese with a modern twist
5
Went there for Valentine's day and was treated to good service, quality Cantonese food and nice ambience. We are both Cantonese and found the taste very authentic. Would want to visit again to try dishes off the ala carte menu.
5
Every single dish was delicious. All the service personnel were very polite as well. Food was slightly pricey, if not I will come back often.
5
Parking was easy, they reimbursed my parking, services was good, food was fantastic and unique, there is a chill out bar nearby. What else to ask for?
5
Most value-for-money chinese fine dining, especially you go in large groups where you get to order and taste more dishes. Great service, wide variety of food, and the best barbecued pork i ever have!
4
It’s quite a nice breakfast at Mitzo. It’s at the Grand Park Orchard Hotel, across Paragon and Mandarin Orchard. The spread not as extensive as others but it’s all fresh and delicious. Service quite good too.
5
We ordered a mix of dim sum set lunch and ala carte items. The food were well presented and tasted good. The service was excellent too!I would definitely recommend for a modern twist in Chinese food.One suggestion was to periodically change the dim sum set lunch menu as it was the same menu when I dined in Oct 2017
3
I have been to Mitzo a number of times. The first 2-3 times, was quite impressive. I love their dim sum. They are different from the other Chinese dim sum restaurant. Great presentation and taste. Love their barbecue pork the most. But for dinner, the dishes were mainly on the salty side. Very strong flavor. Overpowered the ingredients itself. First time trying their dinner, and quite disappointin
4
We had our Chinese reunion dinner here. The yu sheng was unique from other places and was very tasty and high memorable presentation and execution. The other stand out dish was the duck with truffle sauce, which was very succulent and delicious; also a very unique style that we have never had anywhere else. The waiter and waitresses were not just attentive but very engaged as well. Kudos! High recommended
5
Extraordinary dinning , food was excellent, ambience is superb , service impeccable. The presentation of the food is so gorgeous and unique and yet the price is reasonable
4
Service staffs are very friendly and the food is good. My favourite will be the seafood braised vermicelli!
4
The atmosphere and decor was swanky. Unfortunately, the dim sum from buffet brunch was disappointing in terms of taste. Not worth visiting. The service staff were friendly and helpful but were not very clear in explaining the menu.
4
Floor Manager is accommodating & patient. He is able to explain what is signature dish & recommend dishes that are suitable for my family. Staff is attentive, overall service is good & food is delicious
4
Food is very good. Happy hour 1-for-1 cocktails (until 9 pm daily) promotions are well-made and worth it.
5
I requested for Peach Buns for my father's birthday and Mitzo fulfilled my request. Thank you Mitzo it made my father's birthday celebration a awesome one!
5
I booked a fabulous brunch for a party of 6 at Mitzo for my husband's birthday. The food was amazing and the beauty of it was that it was brought to the table. The handcrafted cocktails were fabulous, the champagne was definitely free-flowing and the staff were very attentive. Would highly recommend. They even made a wonderful birthday cake for my husband.
5
A friend brought me here and I loved it so much, I brought some family members here a few weeks later. Excellent food. The truffle duck, the garlic chicken, the Chinese kai lan. Simple food but done so well. The staff were great, especially Azlam for the very pretty gin and tonic he made me. Great ambiance.
5
We have been to Mitzo thrice. The first was with a group of friends, the second alone as a couple and lastly we celebrated our Mum's birthday (as a family of 6) there. For us to do it 3 times for 3 different occasions meant this place had done not just something right, but everything right.Food wise, their signatures would never disappoint. We loved the BBQ pork and truffle duck. We tried both ala carte and buffet. The collage is that from our buffet. I would also recommend 'Happy Hour' drinks. Service wise, all of them were very friendly, including even the guy from behind the bar counter. They would be able to describe and recommend dishes for you and even put efforts in helping out for the birthday celebration. My only apology is that I could only remember 'Chrystal' as one of several pleasant staff there.Thank U Mitzo for being consistent in your food and service
4
Tried the ala carte menu. Chosen the poached rice with lobster meat, their signature char siew and some steamed Dim sum. Nothing special about the dim sum but the char siew lived up to the expectation and was really nice. The poached rice with lobster meat was really tasty with the broth which was a pleasant surprise
3
The wait staff should be clear and understands how the set lunches system works as the menu was not clear in stating that both set lunch must be of the same food items.
4
good place to chill, nice ambiance and food was good though the food portion was of sharing size....
4
First visit to this establishment. It has a nice ambient. The staff were attentive, friendly and very helpful. The food were also excellent.
Noise level is a little high but overall experience is great.
5
Very good service and food. The coffee pork neck was very special. Very good recommendation by Wai Yee on the lobster claw
3
Our family would generally greet the New Year with a sumptuous family lunch. We were delighted to have a new place to try out Mitzo’s Buffet ala Carte Menu which seemed quite impressive. However, whilst the food selection was reasonably good it still fell short of our favorite Majestic Restaurant that has temporarily ceased for Relocation. The dessert selection was limited versus Majestic’s choice dessert selection which would be our Grand finale.
5
Went for lunch mid-week with my family for and we had the set dim sum menu. We were four adults and a baby, and they prepared for us a table in a quiet corner with plenty of space for putting the stroller next to the table and for moving around with the baby. The staff was very courteous and attentive.The food was incredibly tasty, far from the traditional flavors easily found in Singapore. Royal shrimp dumpling with caviar were my favorite, with multiple flavors bursting when eating. A must try if looking for dim sum with a cool twist
5
2nd time here, this time for a family nye meal. We were able to secure a private booth/corner, and pre-order some dishes ahead to avoid waiting or sell-outs. We had the popular BBQ Pork, Coffee Pork, Truffle Duck, Beancurd Tofu, Spinach with 3 Eggs, Fried Crystal Vermicelli with Fresh Lobster Meat, and the Seasonal Cocktails. Food was really good, and the service extremely attentive and friendly, led by the Hotel F&B Manager Chun Kiat. Will definitely come back again
5
The service staff was very polite and friendly. I carried my baby girl throughout the dinner and the staff was very nice and thoughtful to ask if we need them to help carry my baby girl so that we can have our dinner, after we rejected them politely, they helped to put a few cushion under my arms so that when I carry my baby girl it is not so tiring and straining on my arms.
4
Was at Mitzo's for Christmas weekend brunch. Service crew was excellent - attentive and prompt, and highly accommodating. Food was beautifully presented, though some items stood out more than the others - definitely recommend the char siew, Hokkaido milk cheese tarts and the mango cream dessert
4
Love daily soup of day. Good place for Kids while dine in peace for adults. Love roast pork (char siew) which is their specialty that you could taste their charred but delicious to chew. You will have second serving! Noodles quite nice and soft. Fried prawn in nori seaweed is a thumbs-up including the mini tarts created by one chef. Ooahh so good and suitable for kids to
5
A good and cosy restaurant with excellent staff serving you every dish. Must try the honey roasted BBQ pork.
4
atmosphere is warm n cosy. the staff give good recommendations and are very attentive.
the food served is very fresh.potion per serving is good for 2 to 3 pax.
there was also cocktails at 1-for-1.
4
Went there for a couple cocktails. They had a 1 for 1 cocktail promotion going on which comes with a complimentary snack as well. Pretty decent. Just hope they can do more to deliever more wow in their product offerings.
5
Recommended dishes: Mitzo special barbequed pork, crispy roast pork belly, black truffle crispy roast duck, braised vermicelli with scallops, prawn and cod fish.
5
My friend and I went for its dim sum set lunch which is price reasonably for the quality of food. Portion is just nice and we add on vermicelli and Mitzo special BBQ sauce pork. It was da bomb!
5
Assistant Restaurant Manager Ryan has been exceptional in leading his team to the highest service standards. Their honest, thoughtful and genuine approach on more than one occasion has kept us coming back for more.They also have a great Happy Hour promo on cocktails until 9pm prepared by Ken and Ming Shun who were a fun duo to be around!Will encourage couples and groups of all sizes to give this place a go :
5
Decided to take my wife somewhere for a dinner treat, and Mitzo was a pleasant suprise. While didn't check out the Menu before making a reservation, the chinese dishes we ordered were nothing like we have tasted at the traditional Chinese restaurants. You ought to try their signature BBQ Pork, Crispy Duck, and we also loved the Chef Recommended Soups. It was so good that I brought my parents for another meal within the month. I recommend it for family dinners and any tourists who would want to treat themselves to a "Casual Chinese Fine Dining" experience.
4
Only in Singapore for a night and this was close to the Hyatt. Probably a bit pricier than we had in mind but very nice first night meal which two teenage daughters also enjoyed. Incredible festive cocktail. Menu says portion sizes are small but they’re not so don’t over-order.
4
Went here for the alacarte buffet weekend brunch, food was very pretty but nothing really to shout about except for the chasiu which was amazing. Dimsum dishes were above average, but have had better elsewhere. We topped up for free flow of champagne and cocktails which were great as we had a chance to sample their different cocktails - some were quite innovative! Don't recall the name but we had a tomyum cocktail which was quite good
5
First time here on a Friday to celebrate my birthday. First impression of this was that is this even a restaurant? The food did not disappoint and the service was excellent. Char Siew is one of the must order food and the desserts too. The service staff was very friendly and one of them overhead that we need tissues and got us serviette without us asking for it
5
Food are delicious and highly recommend coffee char siew with egg skin wrap. Staff are attentive and friendly. Can enjoy a lazy cozy afternoon in the restaurant while leaving your kids in the play area. Wonderful!
5
I am a fan of Mitzo’s ladies gourmet night, where ladies enjoy free flow delectable dimsum and alcohol every Thursday night!
5
Had a enjoyable set lunch. The char siew is one of the best that I had tried before. The caramelised sugar crusted char siew gave it a nice crunch and the meat is tender with the right amount fats.
4
If you are looking for really good Asian food but not too basic, then you must try Mitzo. Genuine but still a western style to it. My favorite Asian in Singapore.
5
Dishes were flavorful and impactful. Makes one go mmmm and ahhh with each dish. Don’t miss out their Maka with Lobster Soup, Deep Fried Codfish with Truffle Enoki, BBQ Roast Pork!!
4
Really great ambience. Maybe if there are more dim sum selective will be even better. Some recommended dish wasn’t as yum. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
2
3rd time to this restaurant. First 2 visits was a good experience and it was a lunch and dinner. Third visit was a Friday Dim Sum lunch. Server took our order and inform one of my guest that the noodles are part of the Dim Sum and have to be ordered. Upon checking again, she clarify that its optional as we pointed to her what it says on the menu. Server told us the soup of the day was Watercress soup, however we were served Winter Melon soup. Upon asking the same server again, she replied that the Watercress soup had ran out as it was a first come first serve basis ( even if this was true, I would have expected her to inform us). Server took our choice of Dim Sum individually. However all our choices were not served to the correct person, and we had to let the server know our orders again. If you are taking our orders individually, pls make sure the orders are served correctly. My daughter had a completely different Dim Sum order, which I didn't bother to change ( too many service lapsed so what's another one). Same server wanted to clear my soup when I was just halfway done. Just because I was having a conversation doesn't mean I'm done. Overall disappointed with the service provided by the particular server. That being said, food was good as usual and my guest enjoyed the food.
3
The staff were polite and courteous.Food is average in term of quantity and quality.. The Pu Er tea we ordered were very watery and there is no taste of tea.For the price we paid abt $50 plus per person, we could easily get good and higher quality dim sum elsewhet
4
Celebrated my birthday with my family where we ordered signature char siew, thick slice of pork top with a thin layer of caramel that gives it the crunch. Gotto order that as it’s Super Yums! The truffle duck is another highlight too, served bonless with black truffle sauce. Smell and taste Good! For dessert, chilled avacado milkshake goes very well when i sink my teeth into crispy sesame ball. The staff are very polite and friendly. I must compliment their excellent service ensuring our tea cups are always filled and serving all dishes with a smile. Knowing i’m celebrating my birthday, they even surprise me with longevity buns! I glad to pick Mitzo for my birthday and I truly enjoyed the whole dining experience
5
I really love the service from the staff of Mitzo. Their serving of food is prompt and they are fast in responding to our requests. I went there with my family to celebrate my birthday. Upon overhearing that we are here for bday celebration (And even after we had paid our bill), the staff stopped us and offered to help me celebrate my birthday and offered some 寿桃for free. The ambience is also perfect for a romantic dinner
5
We enjoyed a lot the cuisine of Mitzi Restaurant. The dumplings were excellent. The pechinese duck and the duck with truffle were delicious. We appreciated a lot also some vegetarian dishes such as eggplants. We loved also shrimps with egg yolk.
5
Amazing BBQ pork and Crispy Duck in Truffle sauce. Great service by the staffs from the hostress to waiter to bartender!
5
The ambience was great for an intimate gathering with friends & the food was excellent & impeccably presented. I would definitely recommend this place for cosy gatherings, celebrations & business lunches.
4
From entrance to exit, totally delightful experience! Yummylicious food.. fabulous service.. will definitely recommend to all!
4
The cocktails are amazing. Staffs are so friendly n efficient. Will make it a point to have a meal here just for the amazing cocktails.
5
The service was very good and the food was great. The staff were very detailed in taking note of small comments made on the reservation site. Melvin, was one good example, as I casually mentioned that I was there to celebrate my partner’s birthday & he gave us a small surprise at the end of the meal. It was very thoughtful and sweet of him. So, thank you!
4
My nephew's mom in Singapore recommended this place for celebrating her mother's 90th year old birthday.. For a start, there were birthday buns of course, which was served before the start of the meal. The starter was long beans, prawns and roasted meat. The soup was also tasty. Then there was the crispy duck in truffle sauce which was really amazing. Then there was the big lobsters which were really fresh. The noodles the restaurant's so called longevity noodles came with a big abalone which was really tasty, and also two pieces of gai lan. The special dessert was the aloe vera with the pi pa gao and vanilla ice cream which came in smoke form. The food was nicely presented in an excellent form, and is really good for big family gatherings and or celebration of special occasions. Highly recommended
5
Celebrated a birthday there. Loved their canto fusion food. Same same but yet different. Lovely waitress was also attentive without being intrusive. Didn't try their signature char siew coz we had late dinner. But their crispy truffle duck, their venison asparagus were good. Loved their appetizer nuts(cashew and almond with tinge of seaweed) so much that we asked for 2nd serving. We ordered a lot and I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the meal. :)). Good job Mitzo. We will be back. :
5
The dinner experience and birthday celebration I encountered at Mitzo was beyond expectations. From the personalised service from Ryan, Crystal and Azlam; to the excellent food and ambience, the evening was unforgettable. Ryan came by the table to chat and offer assurance that his team would take care of our group and my strict dietary restrictions would be followed. Crystal introduced us to highly recommended dishes. Azlam specially concocted sugar-free mocktails for us. The mocktails were thirst-quenching with natural ingredients such as cucumber, cinnamon sticks, mint leaves, etc. I would highly recommend this restaurant, suitable for all occasions
5
Cheap and good, for excellent Cantonese fusion. Their latest lunch sets are dimsum sets, but if you go in even numbers, you will find you can sample more of their dimsum (find out for yourselves what I mean). The double boiled soup was excellent. The presentations were tastefully done. The char-siew is simply amazing; I used to think the one in Oversea Restaurant (now no more in Singapore; only in Malaysia) was the best, now it’s place has been displaced!! Service was excellent.Go go go!
3
Food: Dim Sum should be "steaming hot", unfortunately food served was "warm" only.
Service: Staff are polite and knowledgable
Ambience: Very warm and cozy set up
Amenitites: Accessible by mrt - convenient
4
Good ambience and variety of food could be better. Pricing can be a little lower. Service is good too.
4
I would recommend the weekend brunch experience. Service is not bad if you’re firm with them otherwise they may seem standoffish! The food is great!
5
awesome bbq pork and service.. the manager was attentive and staff was polite and friendly. Dim sum is so good.
5
Really awesome food & Services. The food portions are super reasonable and the quality is tip top. Prices are reasonable too. Definitely will visit again.
4
My view was worth of value ,good food and taste, will come again. located at orchard road convenience.
4
food was yummy and service staff was very good. She was very good in explaining each and every dish that was placed on our table.
4
Great Food, me and the wife had a wonderful time. Service was a bit slow, but the food was great, recoomend to get the desserts. they we amazing.
3
A corner window seat was given upon my request but no view can be seen as the windows are being blocked. No private seatings.. another couple is just beside us.Food are nice. Just the meat with asparagus Abit too salty. Love the fish, melts in ur mouth. We have the signature menu, with the UOB promotion one for one, it's worth a try on special occasion.He had the 3 寿桃包 for my special birthday request. They don't have birthday cake. All went well just that another couple beat us to it and have the 3 寿桃包, So no surprises. Overall a pleasant experience ☺
5
Recommended by a friend i tried this place...only one word: wow!!!It's Chinese food, but not the traditional and for me (European) i found it amazing. I have eaten duck with truffle, seabass with asparagus, crab and salted egg fried rice, lobster, pork belly...all very very good and presentation/plating amazing.Waiters well trained and nice, always explain the dishes, good wine and cocktails list
5
Excellent food with excellent service at the weekend brunch. Will definitely be back. Do yourself and your family a favour by making a reservation.
1
All the Dim Sum is cool, foods choose not much, not recommended this restaurant. some food very salty.
5
Exquisite dim sum beautifully presented and delicious. Staffs are polite and helpful. We ordered set lunch - great way to try out the selection of dim sum. Too full to order other items but I heard the char siew is superb. Will order next time.
5
Bbq pork was the best i had..food was really good and service was impeccable..money well spent and definitely will be back again
4
The Weekend Dim Sum Lunch Buffet was definitely worth a try. You will be spoilt for choices. Just ordering 1 of every item is enough to keep you full!
5
The food was exquisite and well presented. Price is reasonable too. The service staff gave very good service.
3
Service from Amy was great, spacious dining area. Barbecue pork was very delicious.
However, overall food were very very salty.
4
Great weekday set lunch deal. Artisanal dum sum lives up to its name - quality ingredients, rich flavors. Double boiled cordecep flower soup was a tad on the salty side. Vermicelli soup was tasty, although it’s really a crab and not lobster claw. Service was attentive - water was refilled as soon as our glasses were not close to empty. Refreshing decor - read no garish chinois furnishings- for a Chinese restaurant
5
We visited Mitzo for a family birthday dinner and with high expectations. On arrival we were seated in a modern elegant, spacious dining room, and expertly advised and served with very good cocktails including mojitos and pink bubbles. We ordered a variety of dishes including the barbecue pork, Peking duck, garden deep fried dim sum platter, stir fried red yeast scallop, venison with asparagus, braised tofu, French beans with chicken and minced turnip, accompanied by stir fried noodle and fried rice. Menu choices were ably and helpfully assisted by very knowledgeable waiting staff.We can honestly say that all the dishes were really very very good, the standouts being the barbecue pork which was both unbelievable succulent and crispy with a wonderful richness and depth of barbecue flavours. The Peking duck was elegant, with beautifully crispy skin and succulent meat. The garden deep fried dim sum platter was visually stunning and each element accurately cooked with great flavours. The scallop dish was good but I though very slightly over cooked, and the venison wrapped asparagus was a triumph of accurate cooking, great flavours and clever presentation. The tofu and bean dishes were accurately cooked and tasty. It almost didn’t matter that the accompanying fried rice was a little dry, the noodles were perfect. The food was accompanied by a very palatable prosecco and teaWe finished the the meal with beautifully presented longevity buns.Service was polite, friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful, and created a lovely atmosphere. Prices were reasonable for this very high standard of modern style Cantonese cuisine.It was a memorable meal, we would definitely eat here again. We all had a really good evening, including our youngest guest (4 1/2 years old)
5
Lazy Sunday lunch was surprisingly fantastic as we found out at Mitzo. Their renowned char siu, truffle duck, etc all surpassed our expectations. Many dishes came with a different twist to the dish vowing us every time. Great friendly service too. Will definitely be back again & again for more
5
Chose the ala carte meal. Food presentation was nice. Service was excellent from Crystal and the bartenders. Will go back to try the brunch soob
4
My friend and I had dim sum platters and prawns with lemon sauce for dinner . The dishes were well executed and we enjoyed all of it . We will be back for the weekend dim sum buffet.
5
Impeccable service. The service team was friendly and professional. The complimentary dessert (the-must-try cheese tarts) was offered to us every hour. It was one of the best restaurants for weekend brunch in Sg.
4
Asparagus wrapped with venison and XO fried rice. Nice ambience. Waitress super attentive. Love the birthday surprise they prepared for my someone special. Thank you.
4
Thought we'd try a new place for dinner. It was a great choice! Everything we ordered was delicious. The coffee pork neck with beancurd and wrap was a great concoction. Service too was good.
5
We had dinner here over the weekend, after hearing good reviews about this place. The staff were really polite and patient, and recommended us various dishes that were more popular with the regulars. Glad that we followed their recommendations, and the Chinese food was really tasty. The decor here is not like your typical Chinese restaurant; they have a live jellyfish tank stationed in one of the corners. Would come back with other friends again
5
The food the service and the ambience was all sooooooo good that one feels that such perfection at such a price is totally worth it.The pork bun and Hokkaido cheese tart deserve a special mention and applaudYou need 3 stomachs to sample the offerings even though they make an effort to get u the smallest portions possible
4
We were told the window seat is reserved, it was not taken when we left about closing. There were three couples sitting separate ( for billing purpose ), talking & laughing filled the entire section. a-la-carte buffet for 2 in Chinese restaurant is good idea. Quantity per serving & selection ( menu ) are ideal. Presentation ( plating ) needs to improve, some dishes are not "warm" enough.
3
- excellent food that is created from the heart with creativity - wonderful taste if you order the sunday buffet brunch- be careful of the pot of tea and appetiser's cost as they charge you a bomb- if you intend to order from ala carte with a large crowd i.e. more than 5-8 people, do some homework menu items are quite peculiar where certain items are meant for 1 person, some for 2, other for medium etc which drive me crazy on how to apportion so that everyone get enough. In the end I gave up and went for buffet brunch- ambience so-so, as hotel is built on limited land, thus the restaurant is in a weird size corner, with larger crowd, the space can be very challenging to manage- many of the waiter/waitress can't speak English, thus must communicate slowly to get what you want. If larger crowd, they get a little loss how to serve customers..
4
I was recommended to have buffet brunch at Mitzo Restaurant which is available only on Saturdays & Sundays. I was there on Sunday. Service was good. Food was very good and include Dim Sum. Value for money. Food was totally different from most Hotel Brunches. Not expensive when compared to 5 Stars hotels. Will definitely eat there again
5
Great presentation for the dim sum lunch set.
Great place to have a lunch appt with friends or friends gathering
2
The waiter can't speak english. We have to wait for so long for the tea refill. Not worth the price.
5
Celebrated my mother's birthday and the chef was creative with the Chinese birthday wishes. We enjoyed the food ordered in a nice interior. Would recommend.
5
My friend and I definitely enjoyed our meal. The timsum was delicious and a little different from the ordinary.
5
A beautiful location by the river to enjoy the famous Singapore Chilli Crab. The staff were attentive and helpful even though the restaurant was packed. The crab itself was amazing, ours wasn't very spicy by choice but incredibly delicious. The wine was a reasonable price too
5
Great food, good service, convenient locationMade reservation via Chope app; received a call the next day to confirm reservation, and suggestion to pre-order if I want to, and direction to their online menu; also specifically asked if there's any special occasion (Yes- it was a mini farewell, and my birthday rolled into one)On actual day of lunch; menu was clearly explained: ala carte vs set menu; drinks had a one-for-one promotion that was also highlightedThe dim sums were delightful- all nicely done, and several outstanding ones. There was an escargot based one, shaped into a cute little snail; the crystal vegetable dumpling was beautiful to look at, and amazing natural colours from beetroot/carrot/celery??, and was sweet and crunchy. Char Siew, roast duck were very well done.Cocktails were unique, and we all loved the local twists to them.Very pleasant surprise at the end of meal, when they presented some "birthday peach buns"- I didn't expect this extra little touch.Will definitely visit again
4
I made a reservation through Chope and bought $300 worth of vouchers with 10% discount but was informed that It can't be used for this weekend buffet. Luckily I was refunded the full amount. Perhaps the system should prompt customers again vividly before proceeding to payment as it is not a small amount. Most of the dishes were delicious, ambience was very cosy for our ladies hang out, service staff were friendly and prompt to service. Some dishes e.g udon and stir fried asparagus (without the turbot?) were not tasty and not worth the price of the buffet. Thank you
4
Third visit. Still the same thoughts. Lovely ambiance. Delicious food. Set menu was value for money. The only reason why Mitzo gets 4 out of 5 stars is the service. We had to repeatedly ask for water and ice. It was hard to catch the attention of passing staff. The staff who served us was friendly but was uninformed about the menu and neither spoke English or Mandarin well which made communication difficult. If their service was better I'd definitely patronize them more.
4
Overall, we had a great brunch. The decor is modern and funky yet it exudes a very cosy vibe. The number of items on the ala carte menu is just right. We ordered most of the recommended dishes and were not disappointed except for the duck noodles, which we thought was quite bland and the portion too large. The char siew was the best we had in a while. The crunchy char surrounding the pieces of char siew is sweet and addictive. The meat was not overly dry. One improvement could be to shorten the waiting time between each dishes. We waited about 10 mins for each item
2
Food quality deteriorated compared to the last time I went and service was bad. We received food we didn't order and didn't receive what we ordered. We mentioned a few times to the waiter but still the same. Quite disappointed as my friend came specially just for Mitzo.
4
Had the ala carte buffet brunch on a Sunday. Lots of food, attentive staff and quiet environment even though the pace was full. Wished that my stomach was bigger so that I could have eaten more.
5
This is a beautiful venue, and the food was outstanding. We have Sunday Brunch which allowed you to have an unlimited selection of amazing plates, I fully recommend it. Great service too.
4
Ambiance and setting of the restaurant was excellent. Service level was good. Seems like fine dining but yet more casual. The dishes are tasty but portion is a quite small. Overall, need to pay $$$ for such a venue.
5
Food and price performance was very good! Great service and a wonderful overall dining experience! Staff were friendly and very accommodating!
5
We enjoyed the food very much. The restaurant is being flexible in accommodating our need amd change the dishes to fit oir number of people.
5
Food was really exquisite and visually appealing. The abalone soup was the best where you can taste the thickness and effort in stewing it. Recommend for anyone in town looking for a relaxing and delicious lunch.
4
Good ambience, modern Chinese setting, inviting with attentive staff, food were great, above average!
5
I brought my girlfriend for lunch to celebrate her birthday. We were greeted warmly when we arrived at the restaurant by a Malay manager and his staff. We ordered the Mitzo's Specialties Set Meals, which featured extravagant dishes like bird nest in carrot broth, chilli lobster and abalone noodles. The food were flavourful and certainly worth the cost. Special mention to Wayne and Janet who attentively served us. After the meal, Janet and her colleague presented a plate of Longevity buns and sang her a birthday song. We were delighted by the kind gesture from the restaurant.Thank you Mitzo for the wonderful sevice
3
Late night supper. Price is pretty high, but fails to deliver quality. one of the worst dim sum along the orchard belt. Granted the dim sum was pretty innovative with abalone on the siew mai but doesnt taste good, hai gao stiff juice-less, soup dumpling average. Ramen soup plain and pretty big bowl.
5
Great food although portions were on the small side. Loved the charsiew! Dim sum platter was decadent with baby abalone and caviar. Unique dessert especially the mystery egg that looks like salted egg! There were a few forgetful moments for the staff with the 2nd helping of rice and change of tea cup. Overall good experience
5
Exquisite dimsum dishes with exquisite ingredients. Tried the signature dimsum dishes as indicated by the chef's recommendation on the menu. Good certainly did not fail expectations. Service by staff was sincere and great, except could be more prompt during peak hour lunch.
5
Food was good especially the honey roasted char siew. Service was fantastic, waitress kept her smile no matter how busy and how many requests we had. Thumbs up!
4
It was an excellent experience at Mitzo! We had a great time there.. we ate five plates of roast pork though I personally think it's too sweet. The birthday celebration was great with all well planned by the team and the chef!
5
Very good food with excellent service!!! Not the first time here. Will definitely keep coming back! No regrets
5
First time at mitzo. Very impress with the food. Great service and amazing cocktails. Will be back to try the other dishes.

- Excellent presentation of food, and the taste of each piece of dim sum is wonderful. Great culinary skills and efforts to create even single piece of food- please more suitable for smaller group as the setup is quite small, and the hosted rooms are quite pack where they put 3 tables of 10 in the place.- for Sunday brunch buffet, the additional stuff like tea, peanuts will be added to your bill and they charge exhorbitantly- with large group (8 above) if Sunday brunch is selected it can be quite messy as some items in menu can only order once but other can order endless- if a-la-carte is selected for large group of guest, please already pre-order ahead, as their menu can be quite hair tearing where some items are for 2 persons, while other are for a small group of 3 or 5, so to make up for the proportion, need to plan carefully. - tea was charged @ SGD50 a pot, but quality of tea was so-so, not authentic enough as they must have refill with a lot of water...Overall, it is well compensated with the great taste of food eventuall

We had the weekend brunch buffet, food was great especially the char siew and hokkaido tart. The chef even made us some longevity buns when he knew it was my hubby's birthday. Ambience wise, it was very very noisy and rowdy, there was a group of folks drinking alcohol at 12noon, and they were pretty much wasted by 2pm. They made so much noise that we hardly can hear each other speak, raising our voices at each other at times too. I just felt that having good food at lunch should be relaxing rather than feeling in a club at 12noon. I am not suggesting that these folks are not welcomed, but at least the management can move these folks to a corner of the restaurant or private room for the comfort of other restaurant patrons.Will definitely consider to go back for food, but if taking ambience into consideration, i may give it a miss

Environment is nice, food is great. But I purchase and book my reservation on a application, and by only making the reservation after then I can purchase vouchers to be used on the restaurant. But the application indicates that it can be use via scanning the barcode or type the number of the code to claim the voucher to be used. Staff was insisting that it must be printed out in order to be used. After much argument then they allow it to be used on a exceptional case.

Cantonese cuisine with a twist, unique in flavor. The signature dishes like truffle duck and cha siew were tasty and thumbs up. overall menu has made my choice seems 'challenging' as every item seems unique in its preparation and ingredients mix.Comfortable environment , great for causal dinner meetings
4
The decor and ambience of the restaurant was great, the cocktails were well balanced and delicious. We got pork as an entree and it was the tastiest pork dish I have had in some time, however the duck entree was a bit dry. All the guests were happy with the rest of the mains we ordered and overall enjoyed the meal. The staff were very attentive and we would return to this restaurant again
3
The website looked more impressive than the food I think. There were some nice dishes but overall, I wasn't too impressed. Desserts were quite nice though. The chocolate truffle dumpling was really interesting!
5
The table is well space . The staff were very attentive . Food portion might need to adjust for solo customer that attend the brunch package so we can taste for different variety .
5
The ambience was cosy & dishes recommended by the waitress indeed good & delicious..
Waitress was helpful and tactful.

I went with high expectations after much raved reviews from friends. But unfortunately, despite the very Super yummy char Siew, I really think it's an overpriced brunch set. Sure, you have the expensive ingredients like lobster (1/2), abalone (also not too bad), but overall I didn't think the dim sum was good, seriously better off with Crystal Jade. The ambience was okay too, looks very mod from far but that's about it. If you want high end good ambience .. there are better options. Service? Was the key let down, first the reception was not a bit welcoming at all. I made a mistake (making reservation for 2 instead of 3) and when he heard that he looked a bit unhappy (but the restaurant wasn't even full...so what's the deal?!?). Then we waited 20 mins for 4 tiny bowls of dessert, which surely were already prepared beforehand (so why take so long?!??!). Really not worth the moolahs. But if you are here just for the char Siew and roasts, sure go for it
5
The food is awesome and the ambience is good for friends to gather for a different experience. Specially recommend their BBQ pork and black pepper Wagyu beef in red wine sauce. The beef and BBQ pork literally melt in your mouth with an even distribution of fats on the mea

My 3rd time to the restaurant. Ambience is great, food is good. This time is to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and I requested if the restaurant could prepare something special, like a small cake, during reservation. The day before our booking, the restaurant, as per their normal practice, called to confirm my reservation and informed that they do not have a cake cos they are a Chinese restaurant but assured me I could bring my own. Alternatively, they have longevity buns if I don't mind. Found this idea cute and nice so went with it. My girlfriend was so elated to see it served together with the dessert. However, the surprise could have been much better if the service staff didn't come over and asked openly who the birthday girl was. The staff could have asked us when we went to check with them in between our meal. Nevertheless we are still happy cos the birthday girl was happy
4
Set Lunch had good variety and taste but we would have liked to be informed in advance that the regular white vermecelli would be replaced by thick laksa vermicelli. That said, we were impressed by the restaurant's flexibility in offering alternatives for soup and dessetrs with items not found within the set lunch menu because we had some dietary restrictions/preferences. Equally impressive was a young Chinese male wait staff called Darren; he was polite, not pushy, attentive, and had a pleasant disposition. Keep up the good wook
5
My 2 friends and I were there for a birthday celebration. It's was my second time there and for my friends, their first time. I knew it was the perfect place to for a birthday celebration because of the great service and awesome food. My friends (and I again) were very impressed with the food and service and we will definitely come back again to enjoy those cheese tarts, char siew and mango dessert! Thank you so much for the pleasant birthday surprise and the lovely experience
5
The glass and prisons make for a wonderful setting, day or night. My favorite seat is next to the window. You can look out on Orchard road while enjoying the play of light on the glass. Of all the food, I like the dim sum best. They are beautifully made and every guest I have taken there has been delighted by their taste and look. The other dishes like roast pork, dan dan noodles, eggplant are all not bad. The deserts are again,showy and pretty, I ordered the selection which is a good way to try a bit of each thing. Some desserts come with dry ice effects and they are all well balanced. Not too sweet
5
Food and ambience was befitting of its reputation as a trendy fusion restaurant. However I was not feeling well that night. During dinner I started feeling feverish. The F&B manager, CK, was very kind and attentive to assist me in purchasing fever medications from across the road, thus allowing my dinner companion to have an uninterrupted and overall pleasant dinner. He and his team went the extra mile for us. It made for a nice and memorable dinner :)
4
Very friendly, professional service. Food was well presented and tasty. Roasted char siew texture was great, but too sweet and salty.
5
Went there for a birthday celebration for a very old gentleman. The food was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place to go for quality food and service.
5
The food was great and served timely. Enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, especially the space for children to play.
5
The preparation of their dim sum is quite innovative. The selective is quite good. Taste was great! Love their Char Siu. You cannot really find the same elsewhere. Over all a great lunch. Will definitely come back again
4
The serving staff (wong) was excellent. Thoughtful and attentive. I look forward to having another family gathering there.
3
This was not our first visit! We love the quality of food and menu selections here. However, this particular Sunday, food delay for sometime. Our dim sum arrived last and need to ask to get it. Food standard was not as good as before though.The service was friendly and attentive though.We hope this was just one off as we want to come back again
4
The brunch buffet was very good. The supreme special dishes were great. Since we were 4, we ordered each supreme special dishes. The steam bamboo clam with enoki and spicy peanut sauce were the best. All the lobster dishes were great and nicely done. And the abalone were good though less flavourful than the others. There were plenty of dim sum selection including classic as well as modern creations. I particularly liked the barbeque port; truffle pork balls; the vegetable dumplings and egg tart were among the best dishes for the brunch. The mango sago desserts was also quite well concocted with yuzu ice cream to freshen the the taste. While Mitzo was a creative experience and worth the experience, I realised that I loved my dim sum for the classic way it is done
4
Heard some good things about this restaurant. Went there with my family. Once you stepped into the restaurant you will notice the unusual lighting for a Chinese restaurant. My daughter said it looks like a Karaoke place. I found the lighting interesting. Either you like it or you don't. I like it. There were few round tables. Most are small square tables for two or they can be joined together to cater for more people. Not a great ambiance for a up market Chinese restaurant.Both the Cod fish and Chilean Sea bass were excellent. The fried Wagyu beef was average but the portion was small and the dish was expensive. The truffle roast duck was something that all of us agreed, to be the best.Staff were not very attentive. Plates were not changed after every dish. Perhaps it may be due to the large size of the restaurant
5
Had lunch with three other ladies as it was a birthday celebration for one of the group. I made no mention in my booking but our attending waitress Yuri must have heard us wishing our friend and surprised us with Birthday mantou at the end, it was a lovely gesture , thank you Yuri!The food was excellent, especially the char siew which was not dyed red but was black , in the Malaysian style and the outside was nicely caramelised. The roast duck was meaty and tender. Will definitely dine there again
3
The fish maw soup was tasteless and bland, they might have forgotten to add in the salt. That was their signature, dish, was disappointed on that. The seafood vermicelli was good and refresh for me. Seafood us fresh. The avocado desert with rum n rasin was disappointed too, the ice cream portion amount was pathetic, which I mean might as well don't include i
5
Food - Quality is great. We find the plating very presentation. Ambience & service is excellent too. Pricing is fairly reasonable. Good value overall
5
The friendly staff are evidently prompt and attentive to our needs. Food was delectable and cocktails are unforgettable.
5
Went Mitzo for lunch with my father. The ambience, service and food are really good! But expensive. They even have a jellyfish fishtank in their bar!
Waiter and waitress are attentive and thoughtful.
Both of us enjoyed our lunch very much.
4
Pork char siew is quite special and a reason to go back. The brunch buffet on the weekend is great value - the seafood (including lobster) is fresh and dim sums are really well cooked.
4
Totally exceeded my expectations! Intense cocktails accompanied an amazing menu! This was truly exceptional
4
Food was good, well prepared and taste was delicious.
Service could have been much better. I had to raise my hands several times before I was noticed.
5
Food was good although portion isn't huge. It was my Mother in law's birthday and they prepared longevity bun and candle for her. Everyone is happy
5
This is my third visit to the restaurant. I was first invited to the hotel to have lunch at Mitzo and immediately fall in love with it. Second visit was on Christmas eve last year. I was to introduce the restaurant to my husband and son so I chose to celebrate our Christmas at Mitzo. This visit, I select this place again to celebrate my husband's birthday. On top of our favourite dishes; namely the Crispy roasted pork belly, Mitzo special barbecued pork and Black truffle crispy roast duck, we tried a few other dishes on the menu... the black garlic in the poached cabbage was good. I love the fried rice with ginger, shrimp and tobiko too! Every dish comes with a pleasant surprise... I can see that the Chef puts in a lot of effort not only to present us with delicious food but the presentation of the food makes it very appetising. However, I have to say that the portion are pretty small... The service staff are very responsive and friendly too... As we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, we brought along a cake and have requested it to be kept in the fridge to be served after meal. When we were ready to have the cake, all of us have a pleasant surprise. It was not just the cake they have delivered to our table... What came out took our breath away... I am not going to reveal what it was, so if you want to know, try celebrating your birthday there. Needless to say, my husband was very happy and so were the rest of the 6 of us
5
Wasn't expecting the restaurant to wow me in anyway as i din really heard of it before. Upon entrance, i was greeted by smiley service staff and from tt moment on, everythg is mindblowing... I am not here to provide you with a spoiler so you have to try it yourself.:)
5
The next time I go to Mitzo, I will request to be seated at Wan Yee's station. She was the reason my dinner experience at Mitzo was the best ever in Singapore.There were 5 of us, and as soon as we were seated, we informed Wan Yee that we have brought along a bottle of red wine. Straight away Azlam from the bar came and offered to decant the wine. Then we bought a bottle of white wine, because it is better than paying $60 ++ for corkage. Wan Yee brought over glasses for the white wine and informed us that glasses for the red will come later when we are ready for the red.We selected 5 courses. The first course was a selection of 4 appetizers : softshell crab with curry (chicken) floss, which was quite light; deep fried seafood tofu coated with spicy seaweed, which was quite heavy; battered lotus stuffed with truffle shrimp, which was pretty good; roasted coffee pork neck served with crispy beancurd skin and Chinese pancake, which was seriously yummy. Everyone was truly impressed with the tender delicious meat and the crispy beancurd skin. The contrast in texture was fantastic.Our second course were 5 half Boston lobsters served in various ways. We selected 'oven baked with cheese topped with bonito flakes', and 'steamed topped with minced black and white garlic in soya sauce'. At $30 ++ each half lobster, it was reasonable value.Our third course were 2 dishes - half roasted duck with black truffle sauce and half roasted chicken with crispy garlic. At this juncture Wan Yee brought us glasses for the red wine. And on her own initiative she divided the meat into 5 two-portions and had them plated so beautifully the dishes tasted twice as good. Our fourth course were 2 dishes : stirfried wild mushroom with Chinese kailan and pine nuts; homemade egg tofu with crabmeat and mushroom in spinach sauce. Again Wan Yee on her own initiative divided the 2 dishes into 5 two-portions for each of us, with beautiful plating, making the course twice as delicious.By now we were thoroughly overwhelmed by the fantastic service. But the best was yet to come. The fifth course was a combination of 5 desserts. The Chinese assorted pastries, and the chilled avocado milk shake, were arranged so artistically, it was an 'ikebana' moment. When the dry ice was activated, everyone went "wow' . Even the next table was impressed. The restaurant had outdone itself this time. Wan Yee stood beside the table beaming from ear to ear. She was so pleased.Our dinner was elevated from a mere dining experience to a feast for the eyes and a feast for the palate, because of the fantastic service which exceeded everyone's expectations.And KUDOS to everyone in the kitchen. Thank you for a lovely meal

Great Food Chinese. If your alone you can eat at the Bar. The Italian Bar Guy will keep you entertained all night.
4
Nice Ambience, good quality of food. A pity the Crispy Pork ran out after 1 serving.
Some other dishes were not available too. A bit disappointed but will definitely go back for the Sunday Brunch!
5
Food is very exquisite and maintain high quality through buffet style.
Nice ambience and the tables are spacious,with good space before the next and by the side.
Attentive service too.
4
Prime location easily accessible!! Heart of orchard. Food is definitely worth to try. A little damage to your wallet but worth it. It's my 2nd visit within a month.
4
Awesome food but would be better if the portion is slightly bigger.... Service is alright but perhaps a bit short handed during lunch peak. Ambience was good but the grp of patrons behind us were rather noisy.
5
I have been to Mitzo a few times. The interior design is grand and the service crew is very friendly with superb service. The three dishes which I like is the signature char-siew, the fried rice and the signature dessert. I will return again.
1
I made a reservation a week in advance to invite my VIP guests for a lunch to try the char siew and truffle duck which was highly recommended by a friend. A waitress called to confirm my reservation made at 2.15pm but she didn't tell me that the lunch ends at 2.30pm. Unknowingly we came for lunch and they told us that the kitchen for the "dim sum" is closed. It's so embarrassing for me as I sincerely meant to give my guests a good enjoyable meal at Mitzo and it really disappointed me. I don't think I will bring my guests there again :
5
Visited Mitzo over the weekend with my family for Father's Day & we were all mighty impressed with the dining experience! Every dish that we had was excellent - the roasted char siew was the best I've ever tasted; the roasted pork was crispy and succulent at the same time; the truffle duck was fragrant and melted in the mouth... The price was definitely above average but we felt that the impeccable food and the service made the pricey meal worth every cent. Will definitely be back to visit!
1
Came to Mitzo for dinner. We had a 5 course meals booked. I'm vegetarian, when I asked for a no meat meal to be served, I was given chicken hot and sour soup! When I told the sever that the soup has meat, he simply replaced it with a bowl of bland and tasteless rice followed by dessert. No 5 course vegetarian meal!Terrible vegetarian food and very poor service. Would definitely not recommend for vegetarians
3
Visited for their weekend brunch, and also an early father's day celebration of sorts.When we arrived, there was no one at the reception, thus having to hang around until someone spotted us. As we were seated nearing the front, the location itself felt rather stuffy, which lasted through the entire visit.Food wise, stand outs were the cha siew bao, har gao, cha siew. Quality of food was rather consistent from a previous visit, but the range of items felt staid and boring after awhile. Taste wise, partner and myself were a-ok, but my mom felt that the dishes were overly salty. Their carbs appear to be their weakest link, and we did not like the udon nor hand pulled noodles. The scallop porridge, Cantonese style of course, was palatable. Overall, compared to our previous visit, this visit felt like a lesser experience. Service while adequate wasn't warm, and requests for water had to be repeated. The temperature/stuffiness of the place also marred the visit, making it a hasty meal for us.
5
Simply loved the place, food and service.
Highly recommended. Definitely worth your visit!
Will return for another feast
5
This place is good for dim sum. A must-try would be their famous char siew. Crispy caramelized slices of tender and juicy pork. I think it's the best Cantonese restaurant in town! And you have to try their cocktails too!
5
The ambience is great for family dinner, and the service is excellent. The most recommended dish is their sugar coated cha siew, best cha siew I have had in Singapore.
5
Great place for gathering. 2 of favorite dishes are.
1. Char siew
2. Lobster pull noodles
Those are dishes you must not missed!
3
The sauce for roasted pork with bun was too salty, and the char siew was overly sweet, overpowering the taste of the meat itself. I could peel off the layer of sugar glaze from the char siew. A pity as the meat was pretty tender. I enjoyed the lotus soup and desserts a lot. The other dishes were unique and looked interesting, however the taste were again nothing memorable.
5
This is where you will your tastebuds will be greeted with possibly the best char siew in the world. The crunch of caramelised bits send the sensation to heavens high. We were there for my son's 7th birthday lunch and the weekend brunch is such knockout value. There is simply no time for conversations to be had as we had a stream of dishes coming in and orders kept going out. Certain items are creative, such as the mushroom looking bun although lacking in taste or punch. The mock escargot that artistically is created to look like a staid garden snail is pure joy to look at. If you want some of the best dim sum in the world, head yo Mitzo. As they didn't have a bday cake, they whipped up a birthday dry ice dessert tray that was thrilling and dramatic.
4
Had dinner with my daughter and ordered their dinner 5 course dinner special. I have to say that the food was excellent! The starter consisted of Crackling Pork and seaweed prawn, both were good. However the prom was perfection. The other notable dish was the truffle goose, I don't like goose but this was done so well that I had to make the exception and devoured it with relish. Will be back! Presentation and plating was simple and elegant. Picture does not do justice as we were so greedy to tuck in that we had to put things back to take a picture. Will be back! Want a good meal and interesting cocktails? Mitzo is the place for good Chinese dinning. Decor of the place was a little too bar like
5
It was a busy Mothers day so we ended dining by the bar. It was the best decision we made because we got to meet probably the best bartender in Singapore. His name is Kentt. He is welcoming and pleasant. Knows a lot about his bar and the food he's serving. We also got a lesson on the beautiful live jellyfish tank they have.Tip:1. Order the Crispy pork. It's amazing.2. Order the Truffle duck
4
Matzo serves a Cantonese menu with a modern twist. Its weekend brunch buffet may not have an extensive food selection as per the usual international buffet but it certainly served good quality food. Each diner gets to enjoy a portion of each of the special items i.e. bamboo clam, lobster and abalone. The roasted char siew was the highlight of the menu - tender, flavourful and melt in your mouth. For me, the most delightful surprises come from the desserts. The mango with pomelo, an item that can be commonly found in dessert shops, was well executed with a good balance in texture, sweetness and sourness. Certainly the best I have had so far. Other than this, the osmathus jelly is certainly a must try. The only letdown perhaps is the yellow sauce that was used as a base in few of the dishes-repetitive and mixed comments on the taste. Service is attentive, relax atmosphere but a bit warm due to the lightings
3
During my lunch visit on 29 May, the exclusive ambience of Mitzo is being spoilt by a group of 8 rowdy loud talking customers. Such group should be assigned to a far corner away from customers who wants to enjoy the exclusive fine dining in a quiet ambience. Really spoilt my appetite n visit to Mitzo
5
Overall, it was a good ambience and food was awesome. Impressed with the customer service before during and after as well (: Highly recommended!
5
We had a friends gathering last week and had a pleasant experience with Mitzo. The handmade dim sum is delicate and delicious. Ala carte roasted pork and crispy skin duck could be one of the best we had in Singapore.The friendly bartender recommended me a gin base cocktail infused with crynsanthemum tea. I was blown away!The modern and colorful interior creates a cheerful ambiance. Service is attentive and professional. Special thanks to manager CK that took extra care of us. Will come back to try their dinner menu, and more cocktails for sure
5
So I came upon this chi chi restaurant on the 4th of the hotel not knowing much about it, but the food selection was B-L-O-W M-E A-W-A-Y. Each variant of the dish was markedly prepared in a different manner from the norm, and the thing is, it worked! Beautiful selections, such as the caramelized BBQ pork, Sakura ginger flavored cod, stir fry scallops with asparagus in osmanthus sauce. Divine
4
We had a family dinner at the restaurant after reading some of their reviews. We ordered the char siew and truffle duck as recommended and these dishes were delicious. Some of the other dishes that we tried were the vermicelli, prawns and soup and they were good too.The service staff were attentive and courteous and we enjoyed the ambience and food. The overall cost for the dinner was reasonable and we will definitely be back again
3
Food was average, roast pork was good but everything else pretty average.Service needs massive improvement. Forgot a table setting for one of us and despite reminders took ages to set the table; food came before we got the cutlery ! Staff also forgot our drinks order and took more than 30mins for our tea to be served.
5
I highly recommend Mitzo if you are looking for a Chinese restaurant with a distinct difference. We booked this restaurant for a birthday celebration and came away with a very positive impression for our first visit. Both the food and drinks menu have their creative lists of items with interesting names and we eagerly await each dish for its presentation and taste. Everything turned out to be a delightful surprise and our group was convinced this is a restaurant that we will return again for the food and service. They presented their own concoction of a special dessert dish for the birthday girl which was excellent. The wonderful service and attention by the staff made our rendezvous that evening a 5-star experience.
5
This is a great restaurant. The decor is very nice. The staff is excellent. The food is wonderful. Breakfast buffet is good. Dim sum for breakfast! ;-)I had a dim sum lunch where you choose 3 from the choices. The charred pork bau was delicious as was the duck roll.The absolute best was the black truffle duck. It is the best duck I have ever eaten. We had many other things on the menu as we were there for 5 days and ate there almost exclusively. Everything we had was delicious
5
Great food and great service! A must-try at Mitzo is definitely their Mitzo special barbecue pork (char siew). The caramelisation of the outer layer gives the char siew a nice sweet crunch when placed in your mouth. Absolutely to die for! Will definitely head back for more
3
We tried Sunday night a family meal here. Being six, we got exclusive seating in a mirror-embellished room all to ourselves! The entrance & interiors were modern & chic. We started with Veg Dumplings & Hot and Sour Soup. Though there were no Mocktails on the menu card, they conjured up a refreshing pineapple based fresh drink which went well with the sultry Singapore night. Our Veg orders took ages to arrive though it was simple Assorted Vegetables with Fried Rice.Clearly the polite staff felt challenged with our vegeterian order! Given the chic & smart setting, we certainly expected more
4
Ambiance is good, staff are friendly and food was delicious. Just some room for improvement suggestions and feedback. Maybe can let the customer know if the dish need extra time to prepare (Understand it is freshly prepared, but waited for awhile for the Hokkaido cheese tart dessert). One of the staff (Should be a leader or supervisor) quite pushy. My bad that I did not check my bill properly, ordered 1 for 1 cocktail drink but paid for 2 (1 for 1). At these dinning place, should have waiter available for a few tables, but find it difficult to call for waiter. That was quite disappointing.
5
Love the ambience and food, had a birthday surprise prepared as well which was really thoughtful. Will definitely go back again.
3
Had a lovely late supper with a friend - the food was excellent, especially the dumpling platter and the crab...but the beer was very pricey...my advice a place to visit during happy hour.
5
An absolutely fantastic dining experience.. a must have is the sea bass dish which just melted in your mouth as well as the truffle duck. Cocktails were slightly pricey but made better with the 1 for 1 deal till 9pm
4
Free flow upmarket dim sum where they do variations on the usual fare. Some interesting creations and combinations!
5
Very family oriented. They even have playroom for kids! Great service from Mitzi too. The food are of high quality and is worth it. High recommended
4
This is my 2nd visit to Mitzo . A nice environment and enjoyable free flow drinks on top up. Minor hiccup on the lobster initially served was not too fresh but service replaced us another serving. Thank you very much for attentive service.
5
Went there with my buddies during the last weekend and had the most mouth-watering cha siu and truffle!! As well as very excellent and efficient service team, led by Eazt! Thank you for the food recommendations too!will definitely pay another visit soon. Keep it up!!
3
This was my second visit to Mitzo. The first was pretty memorable thus I came back again for the dinner. However the food was served quite slowly and the venison i ordered was the osmanthus one, however they served me the black pepper version and insisted that it was the osmanthus flavour. It was served quite cold too. Will not return again
3
The dishes aim to be inspiring and creative, giving a twist to traditional favourites. They can be either a hit or miss in their flavours. For example, while the truffle duck was delicious, the olive fried rice was barely flavoured. The service of most staff leaves a lot to be desired. Some staff members were hardly audible and could not articulate properly. Due to the elongated layout of the restaurant, it was hard to get the attention of the serving staff. We could only be attended to if a service staff member was walking by. I frankly believe that the food has the potential to be amazing. The staff try their best in their job but fall short of high standards we would expect from countries like Japan.
5
I visited to your restaurant on 24 April 2017 to celebrate my birthday. The food and service was impeccable.One must try item is the special barbecued pork,the tender barbecued proved to be one of the better ones i have had.The truffle duck also very crispy.After the meal l call them to bring my cake over and l had a nice surprise;They steamed longevity buns on the spot and some desserts and placed them on a plate with all the Birthday Blessings written on the plate.The staff even sang Birthday song.l am very pleased with their attentiveness.l will definitely recommend my relatives/friends to this restaurant
5
The highlight of this restaurant is most certainly the delightful sweet, fatty char Siew that is unique compared to the standard roast.
5
the best char siew on the planet..
service was very good..
food was innovative and deliciously good..
5
I was there for business lunch. Tried the dim sum lunch set, it's v filling. Good food good ambience .......................
2
We dined there on a Sunday night and it was near empt, yet we were seated in an empty room. There was no music, no ambience.
Food was ok but far from memorable.
3
We heard it had good reviews - didn't realise it was during their opening year.Ambience's not bad - we were the only other diners there for lunch that day and 'hours'.To be safe we ordered the signature dishes. Of the three signature soups only I rather enjoyed mine - the double-boiled sea cucumber with chicken mushroom in pork consomme. I was urged to have a try of the Braised lobster soup with crab meat & tofu...by my trying-to-be-polite regular dining partner - my personal view: it was frightful - a total 'con-fusion' of neither east nor west! Even my colleague's Braised fish maw with seafood in carrot broth did not get it's 'signature' rating by her.Then, the least expected roasted coffee pork neck (I dislike coffee flavoured food) served with crispy beancurd skin and Chinese pancake brought smiles to all three of us - if we had known, we would have order two portions of this delightful dish. Indeed worth the 'signature' rating and the price/value.Unfortunately, the rest of the other 'signature' dishes went down the drain. While the Signature Roast Pork offers quality meat, we could literally hear the sugar crunching bite from the residue of the caramelised marinate - there goes the sugar level for the day.To enjoy the meat, we started scraping off the layer of caramel coating to reduce the exaggerated sweetness of the char siew.The Mitzo PREMIUM steamed dim sum platter at $25 for six pieces of three assortments was considered premium only because of the unnecessary dollop of black cavier, 'missed' baby abalone and what was supposed to be siao long bao semblance. We were three in a party, they could not oblige adding one piece more but we had to pay another $25 for another platter (mind you we were not told we could not just have one more piece each when we requested for it).I love red yeast and it's a rare treat to find this being offered but as in the PREMIUM steamed dim sum platter, in my humble opinion - the chef might as well dispense with the red yeast in the Stir-fried red yeast scallop served with lily bulb and seasonal greens.While I enjoyed the simple, no-nonsense Fried Shanghai spicy noodles with mushroom and bean sprouts my other two dining mates begged to differ - the only dish we differed in opinion.I simply cannot resist Egg Plant which I could have done without but I am on a quest to find the best Chinese Egg Plant dish, I requested for it with rice. Song He rice the waitress carried out the packaging when I enquired why the rice grain failed the rice test (I could reform the rice grain). The service was quite attentive and they tried to pacify us at best with complimentary desserts - mine was interesting - but when the diluted yellow liquid just gushed out with a bite into the bun - that was it - luckily it squirt not stain anyone.Like I mentioned, perhaps, we went on a wrong day

The quality of the tim sum at Mitzo is pretty good, especially the Chef-special dishes. We had their Easter Weekend brunch buffet, which costs $20+ more than their regular brunch buffet. However, we don't see much justification for the extra cost with the introduction of a few more egg dishes!Quality of service needs improving
3
Went for the weekend brunch. Most of the dishes were average, nothing to shout about. But there were a few dishes that I liked: BBQ pork, abalone truffles rice, stir-fried scallop with egg white and fresh milk & stir-fried beef cube. Ended the meal with some cheese tarts and a refreshing aloe vera with osmanthus jelly
3
The food was excellent but we found the service slightly wanting. While the staff were pleasant and polite, the waiter that attended to us had taken orders only of two out of three of us even though there were clearly three of us at the lunch. Even assuming there was some ambiguity as to how many sets we were ordering (which we feel was in fact clear), we would have thought that the waiter would have asked the third person what he would like given that she recorded only 2 set orders. This ended up in two out of three of us being served with a set course and the third waiting for an extended period of time until we spoke to the waiter again to clarify. A further request for condiments also took such a long time that we had to request again from a different waiter whom promptly served us. We ended up with two sets of the requested condiments when the first waiter some time later came back with the requested condiments

Delicate dim sums and an interesting pairing of cocktails for cocktails lovers or simply accompany the wide array of delights with free flow of champagne. What better way to spend Sunday ! And the char siew BBQ pork is not to be missed .. probably the best in the world.. it would earn it's own Michelin star ! Get to know the mixologist Azlam and you may be pleasantly surprised by his creativity!
3
In my opinion, the standard have dropped since my last visit, which was around nov/dec 2016.Their signature char siew was not as tender as before, and the service of the staff was not as meticulous as before. The staff did not initiated to change our plates even though our plates were dirty (we had to request for it). I do not know if this was their usual practice (probably saving water and not changing so many plates), but I do know that most Chinese restaurants change the diner's plates after every few dishes being served. Other than that, I guess the service was okay. Just felt that the turnover e.g clearing away dirty plates/refilling of teas was rather slow. Food wise, yes they were unique. However for taste wise there wasn't that "whao" factor given that the presentation of food was very appealing. Do not take this review as a genuine representation of the restaurant. All human perceive things differently so you may have to try it out for yourself to know! (:

Vegetarian dim sum platter was creative and tasteful.
Lobster with bean sauce was good, but too small a portion.
Tofu with minced chicken was on par with Summer Pavilion.
Worth the prices and atmosphere.
3
The Vermicilin and Char Siew could have been better. The noodles was not very frangrant, the Char Siew was a tact too sweet and not crispy and melt in your mouth.
4
Mitzo offers great food, service and nice ambience. Do expect to pay a premium for the food and drinks.
2
The Dim Sums were very sweet, lots of sugar, lots of cream, but overall not very good.
Too much cream, tomato sauce, sweet sauce, even on the lobsters !
Probably a bad day but an experience I shall not renew.
5
We had the brunch buffet. The service was excellent. Waitress attend to our table almost every 10 minutes to clear the dish and refill our drinks. The food were nice as well. Must try is the Char Siew.
5
Love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the chill out bar. The ambience is awe-inspiring and decor is full of energy fill with vibrant colors. Makes you feel like you are inside a kaleidoscope. The food are wonderful especially their famous signature crispy caramelized char siew. Cripsy on the outside and tender on the inside. Their cocktails from the bar is also must try. Have a lovely evening at this place. Would love to come back again.
5
Mitzo was selected as one of the 4 finalists in the Singapore Cocktail week and I knew it is time to pay a visit to try the Shiok Collins... totally blown me away with the very local creation.. who knows chilli padi and curry leaves can create such a distinctive drink that has so much Singapore personalities in it... Mitzo top itself again
2
The dim sums were ok, the service was slow, very slow, and after 5 cocktails I barely had a buzz. We tried the pairing menu and only the first pairing was served properly, the rest was incorrectly paired and/or served at such staggeringly different times we couldn't enjoy the pairing experience. Either one dish got cold as we waited for the cocktail. or a cocktail became watered down as we waited for the next dish
4
We had the dimsum set menu which was absolutely value for money. The dimsum was excellent. Beautifully crafted and tasty. Didn't fancy too much the braised vermicelli though. I will bring my family back to try more dishes.The service could have been better. They seated my friend and I separately even though we quoted the same reservation. Even basic things like giving us the menu took over 10mins. The main waiter in our section seemed to be more preoccupied by certain business tables rather than casuals like us. Restaurant decor was trendy and modern. Not your typical chinese restaurant which was very refreshing aesthetically.
4
Overlooking Orchard Road to watch the ebb and flow of the shoppers - the deco and atmosphere was very nice, relaxed and calm. Unlike many brunch menus, there's no 'buffet' style self-service - you do the traditional dim sum style of writing your quantity down on the form and they bring the dishes round as they make them - we where a bit caught out by everything coming at once (we later found out we could of paced the desserts to come later from a friend- but weren't informed by the staff at the time, so make sure you ask when you fill your order!) The waiting staff where efficient and 'ok' but not terribly friendly or overly attentive, and seemed to act like student 'weekend-jobbers' rather than the highly-trained silver service staff you'd expect at Grand Park. The one exception was the bar staff who where absolutely brilliant - both is service and quality of drinks. The cocktails where really delicious and very well conceived (especially liked the Gingsen Daiquiri ) - The top up of $60++ per person for free flow of cocktails, champagne, wines and beer was really good value.Finally - the FOOD. My lordy it was good! Some dishes where more hits than others - the special barbecued pork, bamboo clams, Caviar fried rice with crab stick and Hokkaido milk cheese tarts where all really superb... the buns, dumplings and wok-fry dishes where all of high quality too (but fairly small in size, which is good if you over order)
3
Nice atmosphere. If u r comparing w Hua Ting and equivalent, no fight. Didn't really fancy the remake of the duck (overwhelming truffle) and char Siew (too sweet and too much glazing)
4
Truffle pekking duck was delicious. Skin was still very crispy after a long time! Ambiance is great for all occasions.
4
The food was presented very uniquely with a mix or east and west. Ambience was good for both business and personal dining. Will come back for more.
3
Truffle duck was nice but portions at this restaurant are too small compared to the prices they charge.
4
Their signature char siew is a must have dish. Will come back to try out the rest of their dishes whenever possible.
1
On 2 occasions we called to make a reservationThe first time we were told that the kitchen is closed when it was 1045pmOn the second time we were told that there's no food and kitchen is closed again for a private event when the website clearly states open till 2am and that they had great food for supper after midnight! Come on be serious about your business and operating hours. You're making a mockery out of the F&B business The least you could do is update your websites and the other sites that you choose to help market your business.
4
Went to try out their dim sum buffet on a Sunday afternoon. Yummy! My appetite is always way bigger than my stomach, so I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes, which were small enough to allow us to order more variety, so we could try more items available on the menu.Everything was delicious! I especially loved the signature char siew, with the crunchy sugared exterior, but my bf found it too sweet. Also really enjoyed the cod fish dumplings, braised duck pulled noodles, custard moon buns, chocolate dumplings and longan treasure tea. Bf loved the steamed bacon rolls, we must have ordered 3 portions at least! Great way to spend a lazy weekend. Service was polite, prompt, and unobtrusive, which is exactly the type of service I enjoy. Will definitely be back
4
Another great experience at Mitzo. This time we did the ala carte dim sum platters, char siew and braised vermicelli. Everything was great but I must say that the usual lunch set fried dim sums or the buffet fried dim sums were much much better. The ones that I had, 2 out of 3 were surprisingly veggie and no meat. Hopefully they can serve the wider range a la carte as well!! For those who have an unsatiable appetite, go for the a la carte buffet which has a wider choice. That said, Mitzo's quality is still good
2
I received the email from the restaurant advertising their latest 50% off on main course(except signature items) promotion. Hence I went with my family (three of us) to have a try last night, This was my first visit to the restaurant since they renovated and changed. However to my disappointment after I ordered three main courses (50%off) and a signature char siew (not eligible for the 50%) I found that the service staff attitudes changed and seemed unhappy. I wonder was it because we didn't order the normal items or......I personally felt that if the restaurant unhappy with the customer to order the promotional dishes only , it should state clearly in their terms and conditions. And not show us their irtolerable attitudes. This surely will be my first and last visit to this amazing restaurant
4
The decor of Mitzo did not disappoint however on the night we went it was very empty. The staff were very attentive and knowledgeable. The food and wine offerings were good. We had the steamed dim sum platter and as we are serial dim sum eaters wherever we go - we enjoyed it. We then had the crispy roast pork belly which was gorgeous but too much sugar for our palates. We had the fried rice with the crab and dried scallops which was good and finished with the peking duck which was also nice. The staff did try and push their truffle duck but we had wanted the peking duck and weren't swayed. A neighbouring table of elders all on their phones were persuaded. We had a lovely bottle of pinot grigio to complement our food. The main problem was the lack of clientele probably as it is in a hotel and it was a Monday night
5
This was the best restaurant experience in Singapore. Very rewarding to see that modern and traditional are meeting.
4
The dim sum was fresh and succulent. The best was the char siew which was award winning good. Enjoyed all the dishes over at the restaurant.
4
Mitzo. I found and booked via chope.com, to celebrate with something new. Mitzo 'redefines the yum cha experience' through taste and presentation. Their signature roast pork is a burst of sweet and savory stickiness, and their specialty egg tart comes with a slice of lemon - in case you like to cut its richness. Desserts like osmanthus tea and mango sago are served in glass bowls, chilled for optimum taste sensation. It's not 'atas'/ haute cuisine, but definitely a treat.Note: for lunch, they set aside a room for the kids incl cartoons
4
Brought my wife to Mitzo for lunch on Valentine's Day. Food was great and portion size was sufficient. Great place for small business lunch talks as well as a quick catch up with family and friends. If you ask for any rooms for improvement, I would probably ask for a little more cool air to tables alongside the facade and little background music. That would have been perfect
4
Quality was quite good overall but a couple of hits and misses- Char Siew had a layer of honey coated - too sweetLiked the roast pork without bunEscargot cheese puff too richCustard bun was disappointing. Hokkaido milk cheese tarts were great. Lobster - liked the truffle one more than the spicy one, which was too sweet Servings for the appetizers and wok dishes were too huge, definitely more than for two persons.
4
Not my first time here so if I were to go back again, the food must taste good. And the food is amazing as always. Service is not too bad too.Overal, good for new concept of Chinese food. Suitable if you don't really wanna have the "traditional" kind of Chinese food.
5
It was our first visit after recommendations from a friend. Took the family there for an early CNY lunch and every one had a good time, including the toddler who enjoyed the play area. The service crew are attentive and able to make recommendations and brought along small bites for us to better sample their variety of dim sum. The tea gets charged per top up though, so that was a surprise. But we are looking forward to visiting again
4
We had a lovely reunion dinner at Mitzo, and the food was so good that every one of us had a different favourite dish!I loved the tea-smoked duck the best - it was a twist from the usual roasted ducks you can find all over Singapore. This one had a smoke-flavoured sauce which paired well with the nicely-roasted duck, and its uniqueness made the duck memorable.My father loved the seabass dish best. The fish was extremely soft and tender, and most important to him, boneless. The sauce was unique as well, probably thanks to the roast pork and which again, is not a commonly seen pairing with seabass.My mother loved the soup. The fish maw soup was richly infused with the flavour of chicken, with a nice crunch from the bamboo pith. It was so tasty that she was inspired to replicate the soup at home! I hope she succeeds. :)My brother loved the dessert best as he has a sweet tooth. It was an interesting mix of yam and sweet potato pastes with lychee pearls at the bottom, served with a fried pineapple pastry. It wasn't to my liking however as the paste was way too sweet.Overall, the dinner was fantastic and EXTREMELY GENEROUS in portions. We could barely finish everything served! I hope to be back to try their dim sum
5
We were there on 26 Jan 2017 for an early CNY reunion dinner. As it was our first time there, we decided to ask the crew on any recommendations. Their excellent menu knowledge literally helped with our orders, and the 4 dishes we had really blown us away! The presentation was awesome; bite size was just right for two, and the use of ingredients just blended in so well together. We also ordered a house drink, Garden of Eden. Wow it's so yummy and we wished we could order another, but stopped ourselves as we were driving. Will bring my parents back to try their dimsum platter next!
3
I went there to try the for executive lunch set the week before CNY. Unknown to me (this is not on the website), they stopped serving the executive lunch set due to CNY. This should have been stated on the website! Anyway I ordered a la carte, and the service was bad. The staff was inattentive and were walking straight up without checking left and right to see if customers needed anything.
4
The food is very good with excellent quality. We had a wonderful time and without realising we have actually spent 2hrs stuffing ourself with Mitzo yummylicious dimsum.will definitely bring my family there!
4
had a good meal ... the succulent duck dish is a must try, and the dim sums! dont miss the chilled pomelo mango dessert served in dry ice
5
Dim sum lunch menu is awesome! Handcrafted dim sum that is freshly made with items from frued and steam section to choose from. Totally a steal for $38++ with daily brewed soup, lobster beehoon and dessert. All made to perfection. Great place for business luncheon.
3
Our booking included breakfast. Hope they could widen the range of breakfast buffet offerings though
5
Top-notch service from the staff who patiently assisted us with our orders and, at the end of our dinner, helped us with my mum's birthday cake -- making special efforts to plate and decorate it with flower petals -- before unexpectedly presenting us a platter of birthday buns as a lovely surprise! Food was fantastic too, and the dishes we selected with the staff's helpful recommendations all came in adequate portions for our table of six. Had a most enjoyable time, thumbs up to the wonderful staff
4
Expect the unexpected dim-sum at this new age restaurant where the traditional dim sum is served with a twist. As a fan of dim sum, I think Mitzo did a pretty good job re-interpreting the Chinese dim sum.1. The double boiled soup of the day was very delicious. This delicious soup was boiled with chicken and unknown herbs. The flavours came together very well.2. Mitzo char siew, aka "special barbecued pork". Truly a nice honeyed twist to the traditional and ubiquitous char siew. I was told it is a best seller of the restaurant and that some patrons came simply to enjoy this dish.3. Wild mushroom and truffle bun was a wonderful sight. The pau were decorated like real Shitake mushrooms, served on a bedding of make believe ground. I am not a fan of truffles, but others in my group enjoyed it.4. Custard moon bun, aka liu-sha pau. Another aesthetic twist that is truly pleasant to the eyes. The custard itself flowed out freelyl but I think it tasted so-so. 5. Har-gow. A good Chinese dim sum must be judged based on 1 particular dish, that is the har-gow. I approve this restaurant based on its har-gow dish. 6. Other seafood dishes. Bamboo clam, lobster and braised abalone with tofu all looked enticing when served but all of them tasted average. Nothing to shout about.7. Crispy duck roll. While I'm usually a big fan of all things duck, I found this particular dish to be the black sheep of the restaurant.8. Hokkaido millk cheese tart. Super duper yummmmmmm. You must try it!Other than the food, there was a spacious private room with toys and movie to entertain the kids. The servers were warm and courteous. Kudos especially Ken who introduced us to the specialties of the restaurant and hosted us warmly
5
Thank you for the splendid dinner with excellent and personalised service. My nephew had a wonderful birthday surprise from staff of Mitzo. Special thanks to Ken for his usual fantastic service. He was caring to my dad who was wheelchair bound and hence he had been checking on our table consistently. A highly recommended dining venue with great food and service
5
We were a party of 6 having dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. We took advantage of the happy hour (until 9pm) when certain cocktails and wines were going for 1-for-1. The cocktails concoctions were innovative and delicious. We ordered an array of their specialty dishes and were impressed expecially by their BBQ pock (char siew), truffle roast duck and Chinese wine lobster. I had called in advance to arrange for surprise Chinese birthday lotus buns (shou bao) to be served at the end of the meal together with a birthday cake which we would bring. The restaurant exceeded our expectations by preparing a nice trolley where the cake was placed together with complimentary fresh fruits, sesami balls AND birthday lotus buns. There were even sparklers! Will definitely be back

Had special festive lunch on Christmas Day. Took a minute to find the place as it's actual on a side street off the main road. Greeted nicely and immediately shown to table even though we were early. Set menu arrived in good timing so no overly long delays. Dim sum platter was beautiful and so tasty.followed by, clams, then braised abalone, then wagyu beef, and finally champagne jelly. At S$88, a good price. Our waitress was lovely, explaining what everything was. She was once very rudely interrupted by another waitress ( perhaps more senior), who just butted in where she wasn't needed or wanted. Bit strange. A really lovely, special Christmas lunch, one we will a,ways remember
4
Nice ambience and majority of the food is tasty. Some how 2 of my hot dishes were entirely cold, guess it has been left for a while. Waiter were nice and immediately exchange the dishes. Almost all the employee greeted us when we came in but no one bid fare well when we leave. Probably because it was crowded
4
I went for ala cart lunch and the food overall was good. The dim sum look very special and it taste good as well - not all but majority are nice. I will return for the weekend brunch buffet next time.
4
Yummy dimsum, double boiled soup, seafood. I love the huge play room to deposit the little ones while mums can enjoy themselves 😀
4
food was good but some were served cold. service was ok. did not like the sofa as it was over crowded with cushions...
5
Excellent food with excellent service! The service staff were very attentive. Love the decor and ambience. Will definitely go back again! Highly recommended!
4
Really good food but they didn't capture my chope reservation and seated me in a noisy corner near the kitchen. When I asked to be moved, one of the staff refused. I had to ask again to be moved somewhere else.
5
I brought my mum there for her birthday and the staffs surprise her with the birthday buns and sing her birthday song, she is very happy and enjoy her foods.
Foods are good, staffs are friendly and services good too.....
4
Restaurant is well decorated and declicious food served. Except it needs to provide bigger portions for tim sum as they serve tiny portions and not fulfilling to our palates.
2
Heard about the char siew. which was good but not enough to warrant a second visit. For the price paid (about SGD88 per pax) and the qualify of the food served, one would be better off at other dim sum places like imperial treasure or crystal jade or wah lok. one could tell that the restaurant tries to scrimp on quality (e.g bamboo clam has very little meat, lobster appears frozen). Tea was add on on top of the dim sum brunch. When feedback was given that the food was either too salty or too sweet, one is told to try ala carte next time because dim sum brunch is mass market and cook probably cannot maintain consistency (i find this to be a very strange remark and a subtle agreement that the standard of the dim sum is not up to par)
4
Overall it was a good dining experience! The waiter who was assigned to our table was very attentive and has very good mannerisms. Food plating was attractive and some dishes were interesting. Prices were a little high for some of the dishes but acceptable for some! A good place for a romantic date or a cosy dinner for a family gathering
4
First time visit so that I can write this review. Mitzo is also restaurant for breakfast for Grand Park Orchard hotel. Each section is compact with mirrors on ceiling and sides so you get a 'reflective' ambience. Good service. Volunteer to recommend dishes for new customers. BBQ Pork sweet & nicely grilled. Truffle lobsters quite meaty and expensive. Safe choices are their signature dishes in the respective categories of dishes. S$50+ each person for 4 - 5 dishes
5
Food is tasty, ambience is good, price is reasonable. We had a really good time celebrating our anniversary there. Thanks Mitzo!
5
Wonderful gathering at Mitzo with awesome food!! The char siew is to die for!!! Will definitely be back again!
5
Attentive and helpful service, recommended dishes were truly special. Overall a great experience! Will come back for the brunch menu - heard the tarts are an absolute delight!
5
Fragrant rice in superior broth with crab meat and crispy rice is a must try dish! this is a dish that is off menus.try asking the crew for it. :)
4
Ambience is very nice and service is very attentive. However they should increase the portions for the price they charge as its too small. Taste is good and the dishes are quite unique.
4
Great experience. Impressive with the Chef, Dimsum are all well décor and exclusive. Love the roasted chasiew crispy and sweet. The waitress are very attentive. Nice environment for family or friends meet up.
4
instagramable food items. food is good even though i know this same location was just a cafe serving the usual buffet spreads before so i applaud the management for switching the concept in good time.
5
Alot of people will agree with me that Mitzo serves one of the best char siew in Singapore. This time round, I had the dim sum set and was impressed by the creativity and innovation. I chose 6 different types of dim sum and my favourite were the cod fish wanton and the duck spring roll. Yum yum!! I also like it that I can always find seats here and whether you come with your other half, with your family or with your colleagues/business partner, Mitzo is a great choice :-
5
Excellent food and friendly service. Highly recommended. I have struggled awhile to ask u this, Since i need to go down to my aunt house to pass her roti prata, " may I fetch u from airport tmr? I will just drop u at BT and go off. Will not disturb u do packing.'Since the next time u will be seeing me will be 7 mths later. Do consider my request lah. definitely go back again
5
This is the 2nd time that I have been to Mitzo for weekend brunch and I have to say that the revised menu is even more impressive than my first outing. The bamboo clam, lobster and abalone are creatively put together and well executed. The Hokkaido milk tart is even better than Bake Cheese tart IMHO. Small selection of dim sum but all are well crafted. This is not your typical run of the mills kind of buffet brunch, if you don't mind paying a bit more but with high quality Cantonese fares, you will not be disappointed.
4
Favourites were the char siew, chocolate liquor balls, hokkaido milk cheese tarts, baked lobster with lemon cream, aloe osmanthus jelly and mango pomelo sago.
4
value for money set offered. service staff was excellent. will be a great place for executive lunches and romantic dinners
4
Fancy excellent moves Cantonese fare paired with bespoke cocktails personally prepared by their mixologist, certainly a unique experience. The char siew here melts in the mouth and don't miss the truffle roast duck. Superb service in a lovely eminence.
5
We had a very good experience at this place. Food is amazing and we have enjoyed the food. So much of variety that you need to have appetite to try all. Nice place to visit.
5
The honey glazed char siew was delicious. They have maintained their standard since our last visit. Mitzo also has continuously and creatively designed their desserts. They have once again amazed us with delicious dessert. Highly recommend all to Mitzo.
5
Excellent and creative food presentation; Food was served fast, perhaps a little too fast; Love every dish; Highly recommended.
4
Nice atmosphere, good music, great food and great drinks. Overall service was good too. Good dining experience.
3
Applied leave to go try the Mitzo weekday 3-course set lunch. At 12.45pm, we were informed 4 of the selection items were no longer available. So we changed to just 1 set lunch and 1 ala carte half-duck for 2 of us. However, our food took so long to be served despite several reminders. The restaurant was about half-filled on 31 Oct, our food came around 2.15pm. You can imagine our hunger and disappointment that afternoon
4
Tried the weekend brunch there and was quite impressed with most of the dishes. Some weren't as good but most were. Some standouts would be the Stir Fried Beef Cubes & the Hokkaido Milk Cheese Tarts.Service could be a bit better though, due to the table arrangements, it's quite hard to find a service staff when needed. You just have to wait until they bring the dishes to your table
5
I found out about Mitzo while searching for a place to hold my dad's 60th birthday celebration. When I called to enquire details about the set dinner, I was offered a few options. The staff were very helpful and took the effort to find out our needs and requirements. It's quite difficult to find a place that could fit a party of 16 at 1 table in Singapore but Mitzo was able to do it. They sent me pictures of the venue and also gave us the beautiful room with the live jellyfish as they felt that it would make the occasion even more memorable. It certainly did! Overall Experience: Thoughtful and Personalized Dining Experience Meal: Fusion Cantonese Cuisine with a Modern Twist without any Compromise on Taste.Sylvia from Mitzo was incredibly helpful. She found out the dining and food preferences of my family members and took the effort to communicate these with the Chef. We managed to customize the entire menu for my family members, and those with dietary restrictions and didn't fancy pork were offered the Dim Sum Appetizer. 1. Appetizer Platter of (BBQ Pork, Roasted Pork Belly, Soft Shell Crab)2. Double Boiled Abalone Soup with Morel Mushroom in Chicken Consomme 3. Oven Baked Cod Fish with Lemongrass, Chilli and Spices4. Truffle Crispy Roast Duck with Stir Fried Asparagus and Scallop5. Braised Boston Lobster with Hand Pulled Noodles 6. Chilled Avocado Milkshake served with Depp Fried Chocolate & Wine Sesame Dumpling The food was individually plated and Sylvia would introduce each dish before it was served. Food presentation and quantity was consistent, and quality was impeccable. Pacing was perfect and not rushed. The BBQ Pork and Roasted Pork Belly were the highlights of the dinner. Those dishes were without a doubt the best I've ever tasted! Atmosphere: Contemporary interior that was sophisticated but cosyWalking into Mitzo for the first time, we were amazed to see the outdoor bar! Definitely made a note to try it next time. Our room was large enough to fit all 16 of us, comfortably spaced. My family instantly took a liking to the jellyfish aquarium, which really set the ambience for a relaxed dinner. Air con was a little cold initially but that was adjustable as well. Service: Indelible professionals with a sharp eye for detail This was what made our dinner at Mitzo such a success. The staff, led by Sylvia, welcomed us warmly and made every single effort to ensure that each of our guests were comfortable. I was very impressed that Sylvia actually assigned one of her staff, Eazt, a charming gentleman who could speak cantonese, to personally attend to my grandmother throughout the dinner. She picked it up over our phone conversation when I was just casually mentioning about my grandma. That level of detail is not something you see often in many restaurants in Singapore. The bartenders were also happy to create cocktails based on our likes and preferences, which I thought was a real bonus! Kudos especially to Azlam, who really made beautiful and tantalizing customized cocktails!At the end of the dinner, the staff rolled in our birthday cake, complete with dry ice effect and decorations! It was really a sight to behold and I could tell that much effort was taken! They also provided longevity buns for everyone
5
Nice cousin and great service especially from EAZT, truly warm heart. Atmosphere in restaurant is just nice, I also saw others celebrated their birthday with amazing cake and birthday song from restaurant staffs!!
3
It was an ok experience with the food and service. Nice presentation but the taste is a little too unique
3
I would rate Mitzo 5 for food - truffle duck and beancurd with crabmeat were excellent. It is no fault of the few staff who were there that there is absolutely NO SERVICE TO MATCH THE STANDING OF THE RESTAURANT. a) It is poorly designed with sections where you need staff to be able to SEE and ATTEND to you. That means they need a good STAFF to guest RATIO. b) Because of the lack of staff, telephone bookings are hard to secure (you can ring for a long time without reply) c) When you arrive, you need to CATCH a staff to take you to a table; then order and in between - good luck, It is like catching non existent fish. If you are lucky and manage to get one, they are very nice and polite. IT IS AN ISSUE OF POOR DESIGN AND LACK OF STAFF. A real pity as it is positioned to be an up-market restaurant
4
 We missed the ala carte dim sum buffet as we went at a later timing. However, thanks to the generosity of the restaurant's manager, we got to taste their new dim sum creation- baked cheese tart! The food was really good! Our favourite dish has got to be the BBQ pork- crispy and caramelised the way we like it! The psychedelic colorful acrylic panels and the music played at the restaurants did hype up the dining experience.

Went for the weekend brunch buffet with a group of friends. 9 adults plus 4 kiddos (<3)Was allocated a long table with ample space and perfectly situated next to the children play room. (Awesome!!)Food was simply scrumptious. Presentation of the dishes were beautifully done. Quality of the food was over the top. We were very pleased with the service (interns and the supervisor) and the timely arrival of our food. It was served at the appropriate temperature. Complimentary parking is available upon request. DEFINTELY will patronize again. Please call to make reservation as the restaurant is usually packed during weekends.One suggestion to the restaurant: The playroom has a good size however, there were hardly any toys for the children to play with. Perhaps something to take note of.Service: 4/5Food: 5/5 yummyliciousValue for money: 5/5Location: Needless to say, 5/5 (downtown) nearest MRT: Orchard statio

The food and service at the place was good, especially the char Siew and the Hokkaido cheese tarts. However, the overall experience could have been better if the food was served hotter, as some of the food served is already slightly cold. At times it's also hard to get the attention of the derive cre

Went for the weekend brunch buffet. Variety was good and we couldn't finish trying all the dishes available. However, the food were served a little slow, maybe due to the weekend crowd. A few of the dishes were a little cold too..maybe pre-prepared before hand. Overall still value for money.
5
waitress is very attentive and the food is excellent. Worth a try! Especially their signature char siew which is definitely worth the hype. The truffle crispy duck has a subtle smell of truffle too and the duck skin is very crispy and meat is tender as well.

Visit Mitzo with my friend as I heard so much about their interesting cocktail & great food. I believe we went on the wrong night for dinner. Being our first visit, we are lost where the Restn entrance is located. We were greeted with this big backdrop for an event, next to it was the host stand (which we almost missed it). The deco of the Restn doesn't compliment the Restn or concept. It feels more like a disco. Service is not at all attentive, they were having numerous private room event, in each room, staff were seen running in & out. There were also customers dressing in weird clothing (maybe company function of dnd happening at the bar as it is closed for private event). We have to keep waving to the staff to get attention for placing order & follow up on our orders. In term of food, their truffle duck is pretty good! The rest of the food is decent. Cocktail 1-1 promo is very worth it too!Overall, this is my first experience. Will I return? Maybe not.
4
Very nice food. Cosy environment. Portion is just right. Very fresh material used. The signature char siew is top of the world, must try. But the range can be increased. Should have more servings for clams instead of 1 per pax. That is nice and will attract return customer
4
A good fusion dim sum a la carte buffet. They have premium (abalone, lobster) and non premium items. The kicker is the unlimited alcohol buffet at $60 with cocktails, wine and beer
5
The experience was wonderful when dinning at Mizo. Strongly recommend to visit restuarant again.
We have introduced friends to the restuarant.
3
Only went here for breakfast and the food was average and very little choice too.
The service was good and the staff were friendly.
4
Fascinating decor with super-friendly bartender whipping up interesting cocktails at good prices during happy hour. They try to be innovative with the food, but they don't turn out too exciting and for that kind of prices (and portions), it was a disappointment. Our dining area was almost like a private room, thanks to the decor layout. Good place to go with your friends or colleagues for drinks and bites.
4
Evident there was an extra effort in every dish - even the appetizer nuts were not the usual that one would expect at a Chinese restaurant (a v tasty garlicky medley of peanuts, almond slices, cashews) The truffle duck was outstanding, char siu was memorable (though too sweet for me), gailan mushroom pine nuts tasty and well presented. The avocado cream and sesame ball dessert was both a visual and gastronomic feast. Service was good - interestingly the staff seemed to be from HK, Taiwan and Korea. Will come back

We tried the S$68 weekend alacarte buffet brunch today, with the S$60 top up option for free flow cocktails and champagne and wine. Both segments of the brunch were disappointing.First, before we discuss the food, the service needs to be mentioned. We had appalling service at our table. We were seated at the first section near the entrance alongside two other tables of four (namely a table of four adults and a table of two adults with two children). One Esther waited on all our tables. She changed plates for the other tables, offered them dessert before they ordered, and even brought a complimentary fruit juice to one of the adults who promptly informed her that she had not requested for it. On the other hand, for reasons only known to herself, she never changed our plates until we asked for it and when we placed our orders (for the ala carte buffet) twice they never arrived and she never bothered to check on our orders. The straw to break the camel's back came when at the end of the buffet she can to inform us that the dessert we ordered through her some 25 minutes ago is no longer available as the chef had (according to her) gone home. When asked why this could happen given that we placed our order 25 minutes ago she just kept saying the chef had gone home and she refused to explain what caused this mistake. Interestingly, when we insisted that she resolve this by properly explaining herself or checking back with the kitchen, she then disappeared and a male waiter came up to get our bill and serve us the desserts we had ordered 25 minutes ago (which she said was not available as the chef had gone home). In case you're wondering, this Esther never came back to our table to explain / apologies for her (at least) oversight.Second, the food was at best passable. We ordered a variety of dim sum and stir fried dishes. Save for the black cos dumpling the rest were but average Dim Sum which could not surpass Crystal Jade Kitchen standards. As for the stir fried, the stir fried scallop with egg white was just a swamp of egg white with barely one scallop sliced into bits in between, and five huge slices of broccoli decorations. Bland and uneventful, that was a total disappointment. (See photo of said dish below, you would be hard pressed to spot anything other than egg white and broccoli, what a rip off.) The beef cubes were average (you could get the same standard at zi char hawkers). The only saving graces were the stir fried fish fillet and the char siew. Stir fried fish fillet had enough wok hei and char siew was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. As for desserts, the dessert which we had to "fight" for, namely the aloe vera dessert, was refreshing (but no different from any Chinese restaurant), while the Hokkaido cheese cream puff was just a mouthful of cheese. Try the whisky chocolate liqueur puff if you are ever here - at least this is different from other Chinese restaurants.Third, the cocktails which we paid to top up for. The cocktails would at best pass for mocktails. As if to scrimp since this was a top up option for weekend brunch goers, ever drink tasted light and void of alcohol. Even when we asked them to remove some of the other non-alcoholic ingredients in the drink to try to help them improve their cocktails, the cocktails remained light and suited only for those who do not usually drink any alcohol. They have also done away with their bar counter where brunchers could make their own cocktails.In short, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Not while its service, food and drinks remain at above-mentioned levels.

Celebrated my son's birthday at he restaurant. Was quite busy during the weekend. Decide to choose the a la Carter menu rather than the buffet. Overall food was good and service was okay. But for the price, it will be on the high side. Be prepared to pay. Recommended dishes to try will be the char siew, truffle duck and vermicelli
4
Mitzo is a hip and modern chinese dining space. Designed for dining that can effortlessly slipped into a lovely lounge. The food is comtemporary chinese with a range of tim sum, noodles and soup. The servings were just nice with fresh ingredients and delicate flavours. The wine and cocktail menu range was tempting, and I enjoyed the Cinema Sour. The service was attentive, prompt and helpful. And the staff were smiling too when they served. Definitely a place to make it a regular hang-out
4
Exceptional Interior design - young, modern & mezmerising with exquisite variety of dumplings and other excellent dishes. Loved their signature mushroom look-like bun, a must try! All food came well presented at a nice portion and just the right amount of flavour, some dishes maybe average compared to other places, but i'd still say they were good. Their desserts were also interesting especially their avocado cream served with sesame ball with yummy liquor filling
1
Service was bad.Service crew were very dos organised.We were asked the same questions multiple times by different staff.We got the buffet, and many items that we ordered never came despite asking and reminding them multiple times. We eventually gave up.Food were extremely mediocre.The fried rice was literally tasteless.The only item that tasted good was the char siew.Will never return
5
Traditional Chinese fushion done very well. Recommend to try the honey glazed charsiew, crispy roasted meat and truffle infused roast duck. Service was prompt and service crew provided great service.
5
The restaurant is extremely child friendly, with great customer service and food. I will definitely return to try the signature dishes again!
4
UOB 1 for 1 set menu is value for money though didn't include their signature char Siew or roast meats
4
Fast and easy to make reservation with Chope. This is my third visit to Mitzo which serves Cantonese cuisine in modern.

The food was so good, highly recommend this restaurant for others to try. The truffle duck was my favorite, the dimsums were prepared so beautifully and tasted just as good as it looked. The soups were traditional flavours with a modern twist, very inventive and one of a kind. I will be back to sink my teeth into more delicious modern canto dishes! The ambiance was cool and trendy. My husband and i preferred sitting next to each other as the tables were a little too long for a cosy conversation, we might have had to speak much louder to one another if so.Only issue we had was with the service staff, a waitress unpleasantly surprised us with the bill in the middle of our meal. This incident happened at 10pm and we had just ordered more food. I refused to be made to search through my bag while eating and take out my card to settle a bill when I had not received my complete order or finished my meal. This was so off putting that it deterred me from wanting to order dessert and made me feel hurried to eat and leave. We told her that this was unacceptable, only upon insisting did she go away.Aslam, your bar staff on the other hand made up for that horrible incident. He took such good care of us, he was friendly, professional and provided faultless service. He deserves the highest compliment for his genuine good work attitude. He was the saving grace to our night.Thank you Aslam and to the excellant culinary team. I hope you will look into this matter and I look forward to a favorable experience the next time round

i ordered the fampous roast duck in truffle sauce and braised char siew, both standard has dropped from the last visit a month ago. The meat is not tender enough to melt in your mouth like my last visit. And the suace for the roast duck in truffle sauce, can'yt detect any truffle at all.The waitress can't even understand simple english like fetch me a pair of chopstick or bring me the dessert menu
5
First time there with infant. Despite the luxurious set up, restaurant staff is super helpful and courteous. Paid with chope vouchers, they didn't show a single sign of sour face , which is rather common in all other resto, let alone one in hotel. Food was excellent! Will always return !
5
Had an awesome evening at Mitzo with friends who love to have custom-made cocktails in a condusive environment. Mitzo never fails to surprise and satisfy our demands... who would thought that even chilli padi and chilli sauce can make their way to our innovative cocktails. Mitzo is for the adventurous who enjoy unconventional cocktails

Made reservation through internet for weekend brunch on 01 May 2016. Ambience of the restaurant is good. Food served is delicious and staffs were helpful. Special recommendation on the roasted pork and cha siew. Skin is crispy yet the fat beneath it is soft, the meat... tender. Serving staffs were patient and attentive especially with kids running around. Recommendation for family gathering with good food to go around
5
Been frequenting this chinese fusion restaurant since it was opened and the truffle duck and charsiew never fails to disappoint! Truly one of the best in SG and with the price. it wasn't too expensive considering the ambiance of the place. Have also tried many other items but I didn't think they were spectacular enough for a shout out!Tried the newly added dishes this time - Lobsters and I thought it could be improved much further on their taste though it was indeed fresh. Nevertheless, always an enjoyable dinner in Mitzo and the service is always superb! Keep it up guys, and I'll continue patronizing for their top 2 dishes (above) as well as their fried rice!
4
Pleasant place. Good portions. Ordered the chef's degustation menu - felt that the regular degustation menu was better but we were hungry and decided to go for more food !
5
Beef is nice. Dumpling infused with jasmine flower in teapot is unique and nice too. Congee is a bit salty.
4
Nice friendly service staff with quality good food. The portion of food is just nice for 4 pax. 1 for 1 promotion is worth trying.
4
The set lunch is totally worth it & the special Barbecued Pork is a MUST-TRY! Will definitely return again.
5
Food was good. Excellent service & great ambience. Perfect place for gathering w gfs. Highly recommendEd!
3
Ordered a good variety of dishes. Most of them were ok. But the BBQ pork really stood out. Definite highlight of the meal.
5
Had my sister's birthday celebration there. Staff were fantastic- very happy and enthusiastic! This is a rare sight in Singapore. Even sprang a double surprise- longevity buns and a mojito drink for my sis! In particular, Esther was a great host.Food was very good too. Ambience was avant garde but nice.Highly recommended

First time dining at Mitzo and it was a mixed experience. Hits: the specialty bbq pork was to die for!! A must-try for all who like char siew with a crackling caramelized sweet crust. The dim sum dishes and desserts were generally quite good (except the tarts were only so-so). Misses: the ribeye was tough and chewy and pork main course was quite salty. Service: was very good in the beginning and our server was excellent when we first arrived...however this faltered bad towards the end when the crowds came in and it was a long wait of up to 30-45 mins for some of our dishes and it was hard to get attention from the servers. Advice: try to order upfront to prevent long wait later
3
Mitzo is a nice Chinese restaurant within Grand Park Hotel Orchard next to Paragon. The hotel and restaurant have a groovy modern ambience ala W Hotel.Food was not served in order of soup, entree and mains. The lobster bisque did not work. But the double boiled herbal chicken was good.They should have clarified about the Peking duck with skin and meat.The crispy chicken was excellent. The dim sum basket was good too
5
Me and my partner went for the lunch set menu and some cocktails whilst on a visit to Singapore. The pork was amazing and the best roast pork I have ever had! The cocktails were also beautiful and the staff very friendly. The setting was great and loved the decorWill defiantly be back on our next visit
5
great place to eat with your loved ones. service top notch. food is superb. taste great. value for every cent.
5
Menu was customised based on our preference and budget. One of the staff, ken, was also attentive to what we didn't like and offered to change it. Excellent service with great food.

Ordered the "best of Mitzo new signature 7-course set menu" at $128++1.Double boiled soup was tasty but abalone and king oyster mushroom was tough (overcooked?)2.a) radish puff - mushy inside, hard outside; b) breaded shrimp - shrimp and coating hard, no taste of foie gras; c) pumpkin in custard - sweet so should be dessert3. Cod fish with ginger and soya sauce - can do with more soya sauce which was not available on the table4. Prawn in lemon sauce - ok5.Lamb chop - they were nice to change it to roast chicken which was ok6.Fried rice with prawn and tobiko which may be why no chicken eggs were used. Tasteless. Took it home and added snow crab meat and sea urchin seasoning.7. Avocado milk shake and sesame dumpling -goodToo contemporary decoration for me- red,green, orange etc with white tables and overhead mirrors with western music playing. No Chinese condiments on table. So did not feel we were in a Chinese restaurant. From the name we thought it was a Japanese restaurant.Service was good with changes of plates after each course. Sauces drips and pieces of food dropped on table not cleaned up shows clearly on the white table top. Black cloth napkin but no paper serviette provided until the end.

Great ambience with cool settings ... It was abit MTV like which I like for a modern canto restaurant ...Food was served in the right proportion for 2 pax. We were happily stuffed.. The only issue we had was food was being served too quickly and wasn't paced well... As we were busy chatting we didn't realize the food kept coming till our table was filled and had turned cold...However, I'll be happily back to try the other dishes... Thanks again for making it a nice International Women's Day dinner..

Dined here on 23/2/2016. It was a 7-course lunch. The food was terrible, only passable dish was the soup. The scallop dish, abalone dish and chicken dish were all cooked in the same brown sauce, though given different names, such as "chicken cooked in Chinese hua-tiao wine". The sauce also got saltier with every subsequent dish. Then they probably ran out of the brown sauce, because the steamed fish was absolutely tasteless, followed by an equally bland ee-fu.noodle cooked with crab and runny egg-white.Throughout the meal, Chinese tea was served cold, thick and bitter. We expressed our view to the captain, and he "hoped that the lo-hei would redeem our lunch". Yes, we had lo-hei though it was passed the 15th day of Chinese New Year. The lo-hei was a mess, can't even describe how bad it was.Then the dessert, sweet potato puree that was too sweet, with a rancid pineapple tart by the side. The captain and the chef and serving staffs should know how bad the lunch was, as everyone ( about 15 of us, 2 tables) left a large part of the dishes uneaten. I felt bad for the host who paid a high price for such a bad lunch, and also gave a bad impression to the guests that they were wanting to impress!I would have given "zero" star if I could

My first visit to Singapore's sexiest Chinese restaurant and it was better than expected! The dÃ©cor / ambience was supposedly the highlight of the dinner but I must say the food was also beyond our expectations. The seating of 12 pax in a long table was initially quite a put-off because it's supposed to be a Lohei CNY dinner. It turned out to be the best Lohei experience for everyone especially the kids! We were given a separate round table where everyone stood around to toss the yusheng. Innovative and very memorable indeed.The yusheng is the best I had this year after trying almost half a dozen fine dining restaurants. The rest of the set menu was very well executed. Guests were all very impressed. Three cheers to the chef! The duck, soup, abalone, rice , dessert were really top notched. Even the portions are generous compared to other similar class restaurants in Orchard. Service is also very good. Highly recommended!! Hope to come back next year for another yusheng dinner
5
It's the second visit to Mitzuo for my group. Apart from satisfying our craving for their signature char siew, we wanted to continue the food tasting experience (truffle duck and spinach toufu) amidst attentive & warm service. The food was generally wonderful and enhanced by the warm, attentive service team. Another plus was the ambience. We were seated at table 20 which felt like a private room in the open seating style space. Looking forward to be back soon
3
Our 2nd visit,. The char siew was not as great as the first time - hard and very fatty this time, but he roasted pork was great. The 3-egg spinach and lobster noddle were not as good as that as Majestic Seafood, and the Crispy Duck Roll was touch, The skin of the Peking Duck was not crisp and the thick layer of meat made it taste like roast duck roll instead.What made the meal great was the amazing fruit yee shang, with the wonderful mix of fruits, great flavour from the fruit juices and the lovely mix of nuts - peanuts, pistachios and seassme seeds, and the great service. We celebrated Ren Ri there and had a cake for the little boy to blow the candles out. Many of the staff, including the guys in suits came out. lit the candles and sang Happy Birthday with us. My son was suitably chuffed.Food was above average, but not as outstanding as our 1st time when we had their signature menu (although there were some misses there), but the service was top notch
5
We had a pleasant experience at Mitzo recently. Ken was attentive & has excellent product knowledge & serves with a smile. When I informed him that we were celebrating my friends bday he arranged for longevity buns to be given as a bday surprise & volunteered to help us take photos. Definitely will return to Mitzo again & will look for ken! Food was good & value for money esp if u have uob card. Their set lunches are going for 1 for 1 at $30+ for 2.
5
Service was excellent. Did not put the guest into an embarrassing situation when her VISA Card had some issue. The birthday request was presented very nicely and surprised to receive a nicely mocktail as well. Thanks to all staffs on duty that especially to Eazt Wong. Your effort was very much appreciated. Definitely will recommend to all my friends to go to your restaurant and will visit you guys soon.
4
my second visit , food is great! service was excellent! Esther was particularly attentive and helpful! will certainly go there again.
5
We have been many times and the food is both delicious and well presented . A best kept secret of Singapore
5
Nice place for a weekend dim sum brunch at the heart of Orchard. Nice and comfy ambience. Great service and more importantly, QUALITY FOOD.
5
only ate breakfast here (twice) while staying at the grand park orchard. looked small from the outside but actually had plenty of dining space. wide selection of food and the steamed veggies was the best ever.
1
I had the $168++ set dinnerThe StartersThe scallop was rubbery to cut through, I had to chew it like a beef cube !!The cod fish and lobster were so OVERLY DRENCHED with sweet sauce, all I can taste WAS the SAUCE !!The double-boiled stonefish soup was just about passable, although it tasted just like the soup my maid prepares. Beware the numerous ultra-sharp fish bones.The EntreThe king prawn was dry. The wagyu beef was the size of four small postage stamps and was also dry and very chewy.The baby sea cucumber was swimming in an ocean of brown sauce. The vermicelli was OVERLY SALTED.Desert was the only decent course.Service was POOR overall.Tea was brought in a large pot, placed at the far end, away from my seat, and JUST LEFT THERE for 20mins without being poured out.POOR QUALITY tea leaves. The drink was so dark and tanic, the pot had to be changed. The tea in the second pot was just as bad.There is really no possible excuse for all the dry and chewy seafood and meat. For the upper end price they charge, food MUST be good quality and FRESH. It was DEFINITELY NOT FRESH
4
After a disappointing failed first booking and slow reception upon our arrival at our second booking, we decided that the food, setting and friendliness of the staff made it a worthwhile visit. The highlight of the food is the sweet glazed barbecue pork that melts in your mouth upon each bite, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Dim sums were okay. The restaurant is also a good place to chill and chat over a weekend morning or afternoon. However, we were slightly surprised at one of the Staff's understanding in English as we felt that it is a necessity due to the restaurant's location in a hotel (service was good though). Overall, the experience is great and I will be back to try the weekend buffet as recommended.
5
Went once for a work lunch and decided to go again for another. There was a 1 for 1 offer which made it even more value for money. Food was great and as usual the char Siew and roast pork was amazing. Service always top notch too with smiles and the works.
4
We had lunch at Mitzo. This place is in the heart of Orchard tucked in Hotel Grand Park. Took the lift to level 4 which is also the hotel lobby. The deco in Mitzo is fusion. We ordered the special set lunch using UOB Credit Card. It is a set lunch starting with appetizer, main course and dessert. The food is nicely presented and food is good
4
I have been here for both dinner and lunch. They special dishes as truffle duck or the pork little bites with crispy skin are delicious. The cocktails are a mix of the usual known (as Long Island) but with a Chinese twist (you get Chinese tea instead of Coke!) and they are great. Lovely staff, very helpful and fun. We got a complimentary plate of fruits which was the perfect end to a great lunch
3
We had a family dinner at Mitzo, at Grand Park Hotel a week ago. As its name hinted, it is a total break from a traditional Chinese restaurant. There seemed to be a lot of fusion dishes although you still get the traditional roast pork and belly pork dishes. The presentation was excellent although I can say the same for the taste of some of the dishes. Besides the meats, we also had two serves of cod, cooked in different styles.The ambiance was dark and gloomy - you could hardly see what you were eating.The servings were extraordinarily small and I walked away still hungry although the dinner for 4 adults and 3 kids cost nearly $400.Not in a hurry to go back
4
Char siu was amazing. great food great service, a bit on the pricey side. regardless, i will definitely come back again.
5
We ordered 30++ Business set lunch (5 courses). Personally I will recommend their fried rice and beef. Both dishes are very delicious. The service is pretty good as well.
5
I have been a regular at Mitzo, largely because my favourite mixologists, Azlan and Marco headed up the bar, creating innovative cocktails that satisfied customers form all walks of life.So far, whenever I have visitors from overseas, I will bring them to Mitzo for dinner and drinks because it is centrally located, yet away from the buzz with chill out atmosphere, that makes the evening perfect for catching up on conversations. Azlan and Marco are some of the most talented mixologists who dare to experiment with different ingredients to create drinks to one's liking. Highly recommended to visit just on drinks alone.But, Mitzo is more than just a bar as its restaurant also serves innovative Cantonese cuisine with a twist. Love the Curry Pork Floss Soft Shell crabs, Black Truffle Duck (Best in Singapore so far), Honey Glazed Char Siew (even my HK guests find them to be devilicious), Ebiko Fried Rice and many more. Its weekend brunch is quite a steal for sampling some of its most famous dishes (not cheap, but food is of top notch quality), including Char Siew Bun which is to die for!I will definitely recommend this restaurant as a great hangout for proper dinner and pre/post dinner drinks

I have been to this restaurant for their ala carte Chinese dim sum buffet a few months ago. I came back again recently for a meal at Mitzo.I tried my first cocktail for the week. What makes this stand out is the truffle foam that the bartender (Marco) puts on top of the cocktail! The straw is made of lemongrass, which adds a nice touch to the drink. Here are the highlights of the food:I started with a trio of appetizers - Deep fried oyster with bonito seaweed seasoning, Chicken in 20 year old wine, Fried prawn with truffles and peanut mayo sauce and squid salad with spicy mint mango dressing. The prawn and oyster were good. Next up was the soup. I had the Pumpkin pork ribs soup with pacific clam and king oyster mushroom. It's amazing to have pumpkin soup done the Chinese way! The clams were palm-sized and cut into chunks. I thought I was eating oyster mushroom but it was soft and mildly chewy. Oyster mushroom were pan fried for a short while before cooking. Nice! This was followed by Wok-fried truffles lobster. The lobster was meaty and the truffle sauce was good!I then had the Pan-fried king prawn in asparagus skewer with truffle sauce. Prawn was fresh and juicy. Interetesting presentation was the 'sharpened' asparagus that looks like a pen/ calligraphy brush.I also had two pieces of osmanthus wagyu beef, which had good marbling and it’s so tender. I ended the savoury part of the meal with the Fried vermicelli (tang hoon) in mushroom broth with crab meat, topped with fried minced garlic that were crispy and added a nice flavor to the noodles. For dessert, I had Chilled cream of pumpkin topped with yam ice cream. Served in a dainty glass teapot, which you dip your spoon into. Nice.This is a tiramisu you can drink! This cocktail was served in two glasses: A tall glass with a 'Shaken' Cinnamon-Orange zest infused cognac with espresso coffee and sugar. The smaller shot glass holds the Espuma foam of Mascarpone cheese with eggs. Totally in love with this! Very good.Overall, a good Chinese meal in a modern setting. Nice
5
It's located in the Grand Park Hotel which is not the easiest place to find, and it's tucked away down the end of the hall on level 4, but it's worth the search. The Mitzo Restaurant is among the best in town! The menu selection and food preparation are excellent. Every item we ate on the menu was fantastic, but the glazed pork dish was to die for. I've already recommended this place to all my friends and I'm looking forward to returning
5
A very modern Chinese restaurant that is perfect for special occasions, entertaining. Great food with a great ambience, music and an extensive craft cocktail list. There is nothing like it in Singapore. Very centrally located in Orchard Road and is a great place to rest one's feet after all the shopping
4
Overall a pleasant dining experience. Very nice ambience, Staff were attentive and food was very intricate.I must say that they probably have the best cha siew in Singapore currently.The honey roasted pork was cut into a nice rectangular block and all 4 sides of the cha siew were perfectly caramelised and crisped!Other foods were tasty.Only downside was the presence of MSG in their foods, leaving me very thirsty at the end of dinner
4
We stayed one night at the Grand Park hotel at Orchard and had breakfast at Mitzo, which was included at the room rate. Food amazingly good and fresh. Service also quite good n prompt. However, the hotel was full so we had to wait for a while to be seated. Other than that we were satisfied with this restaurant
4
The recommended dishes such as roast char siew and pork were made to perfection. The servings were not big so we were able to try quite a couple of dishes. The truffle crispy duck and deep fried dim sum platter was tastefully done as well. The staff are quite knowledgeable of the menu and we had an enjoyable night thanks to their commendable service. Will definitely come back for roast char siew!

This is a 2-in-1 concept restaurant located at Grand Park Orchard Hotel, next to Paragon Shopping Centre along Orchard Road. In the day its There are 42 items on the ala carte buffet menu. The buffet costs $68++ per pax. For an additional $50++, you can enjoy free flow of cocktails, wines and other beverages. Here are the star dishes that I really enjoyed:- Mitzo Special BBQ Pork: This is especially good. You can't stop at one piece. This Mitzo Special BBQ Pork is really good. The caramelised outer edges and the meat that is flavourful and yummy! - Crispy Pork Belly served with bun: Roast Pork Belly in Chinese Bun. A good alternative to the traditional 'Kong Bah' (Braised Pork Belly) Bun.- Vegetable Bun: Bao made to look like mushroom. Break open the bun, and the smell of truffle entices you to savour it. Really nice. Presentation is further enhanced by deep fried vermicelli to look like hay and flowers. - Double-boiled soup of the day: Melon, pork rib and red dates. The pork is really soft and tender.- Braised Truffles Udon: Absolutely love this truffle wok-fried udon! I could eat this all by myself! - Poached Cabbage in Lobster Bisque: Cabbage leaves boiled till soft and a lobster bisque sauce poured over the cabbage. Its unique, and not bad.- Custard Bun: Definitely one of the better and more unique 'Liu Sha Bao' (Molten Salted Egg Yolk Lava Bun) that I have had. Pandan flavored salted egg yolk steamed bun with mixed sesame seeds. It's to-die-for.- Double-boiled almond cream with black sesame glutinous rice ball: Must try. The almond cream is thick and creamy and when you bite into the glutinous rice ball, the black sesame oozes out, giving a nice contrast.- Aloe Vera with Osmanthus Jelly: Served in a transparent disposable square cup, its refreshing. Other items I tried included:- Poached Dumpling with Sichuan Sauce: Dumpling poached and the sauce is mildly sweet and spicy. - Stir-fried Scallop with Egg White: Egg white beaten and folded with scallop meat. I hae tried this dish with fish meat before, but this is a first. The dish comes with a raw egg yolk, which the server adds vinegar and pepper before mixing them all together. Its nice.- Wasabi infused Baked Fish: Taste of the wasabi was mild. Plating looks good. - Braised Congee with Scallops: Would have preferred it to be more smooth like traditional Cantonese porridge. - Fried Noodle with Black Pepper Shredded Chicken: This is like Ee noodles, stir fried with chicken. Mildly spicy. - Chilled Mango Cream with Sago and Pomelo Topping: Served in small portion, Overall a nice meal, where there’s good variety of dim sum prepared to order. Location is also good, as its central

Restaurant is located beside NeeAn city, the most popular shopping district in Singapore. View from restaurant is not so impressive, but the dinning environment and service is good. Food are delicious and nicely decorated. Overall rating is great yet a bit expensive!

Service was great, food was good, drinks were good despite the price (but that's everywhere in Singapore). Lighting was very cool, restaurant has a modern feel to it.

Not your typical Dim Sum place for sure. Very original dishes and tasty. We chose the 8 course set menu. Amazing caramelised bbq pork. Dessert is one of the best i have had in a long time.

It was a good dining experience at Mitzo. Both the service and food was excellent. The deco of the restaurant is very modern yet comfortable.We tried their 8-course signature set menu (currently having credit card promotion). The barbecued pork, oven baked cod and the braised vermicelli with seafood were outstanding

We were here to try the signature set for dinner. It costs $108++ per pax which is okay if they had provided better service. Staff was polite but no one asked if we had an allergy, if we preferred a certain dish/ingredient or not. I wanted to change the avocado milk shake dessert for a royal jelly dessert which costs the same ($10) on the a la carte menu but they insisted that they could only change it for a lychee jelly ($8). So that puzzled me. But what was even more puzzling was that they requested we pay $5 per pax to have them serve the royal jelly dessert. The only delicious dish was the char siew which is really fattening (but good) although a tad bit salty. The other dishes have more flour and starch than required so you couldn’t really taste the dish.I hope that future guests didn’t have to wait like we did. We were served together with 3 other tables, also having the set menu and had to wait for each of the tables to finish with their dishes before we waited some more for the dishes to be served for all the tables at once. I think we spent more than 1 and a half hours on just waiting for the dishes and waiting for the waiter to bring our bill (we had to remind them 4 times over 30 minutes!)Do not think that it is worth the money, time and calories to dine there

service is good, the waitress and bar tenders are friendly. food is a bit too salty compare to the usual food served in other chinese restaurant, but not as salty as the food i had in Brazil. It has a quiet atmosphere that other chinese restaurants are lacking. would i come back again? maybe not. there are plenty other choices to have better chinese food, unless i really want that secluded atmosphere and savoring the cantonese food.

had a signature set with additional truffle roast duck and roast pork.The good- truffle roast duck. Skin was delightfully light and crisp. Truffle sauce was perfectly balanced without being overwhelming- bbq pork. Caramelised with a light crisp coating and ample fat without being cloying - noodles with seafood, flavorful and light- dessert : avocado shake and chocolate/Bailey Mochi ball - contemporary and refreshing- service was good and attentive The badThe signature set disappointed on almost every count except the above. The lobster bisque was more like a tomato bisque, the thousand layer radish cake reeked of old oil, but kudos to the restaurant for service recovery. Sea bream was only just acceptable. The prawns were done to death in baking soda as with the gamey lamb.PriceyRestaurant should review their signature set. As its name suggest, the dishes represent the standards of the restauran

We have our breakfast here while staying at Grand Park OrchardThe food is decent.Not so much varieties Some hot food, bacon, fried noodle, scramble egg, porridge, cereal, a couple variety of bread, croissant, salads, yoghurt, milk, juices, coffee and tea, a station for making omelette and sunny side up. No pancakes or waffle though.Not so much different one day to another.Must come early or you will have to queue

Very stylish & sophisticated Chinese restaurant that I have ever been. And so does the foods! The dimsum platter is very eye candy; very pleased to see. I ordered the steam dimsum which is stuffed with prawn, tiny abalone, lobster, crab & other that I may not recognize but mostly seafood, for $38. I found that the taste of these 4 types of dimsum almost the same & the disappointment is that not juicy at all. I also took the vermicelli (not your usual vermicelli; thick like noodle) with prawn, scallop & cod fish for $28. It was delicious; the gravy is like milk based but very easy to take. I feel most of the dishes should be very tasty & consider good deal for these prices, but the dimsum is really just pleased on the eyes only

Not much selection of western food, eggs dominate and fruit was sparse at time. If you arrived around 0900hrs, you could wait up to 20minutes to be seated due to occupancy. Staff tried very hard to be accommodating but people ate slowly.

I was attracted by the interior design first, they use a lot of colored mirror which give a fancy feeling.
For food, their signature dish Cha Siew really wowed me out, it's the best cha siew I have tasted so far.

Great location in the heart of Orchard, excellent service and food, and interesting interior. This Chinese restaurant is not like your usual ones with round tables and lots of noise. The food quality is excellent (order the lemon shrimp and char siew!!) and the service is perfect.

I decided to give a try to this Cantonese restaurant between meetings in the Orchard area. It was definitely a good surprise, from the interesting presentation to the quality ingredients. Some of the favorite dishes: a Crispy Duck Salad as starter, followed by the Poached scallop in lobster bisque, Stir-fried prawn with lily bulb and almond in curry sauce (spicy & delicious!) and to end our scrumptious meal a yummy Chilled cream of mango with sago and pomelo topped with ice cream. Definitely my new favorite on Orchard… and you can head over to the rooftop bar, Bar Canary, afterwards for a drink

We were staying at the Grand Park Orchard and wandered into the hotel restaurant for a late dinner for the two of us. It wasn't very busy, but it still felt comfortable and intimate in our section (the dining area is broken up into smaller sections with glass/mirror panes). The décor is modern with lots of windows, mirrors, brass pendants and coloured lighting. We had wonderful wait staff, they were helpful, personable and very attentive.The menu is quite extensive. There’s a great range and selection of dishes from this restaurant offering a modern take on Cantonese food. We decided to share a few dishes. We had roast chicken with crispy garlic, stir fried bok choy and steamed jasmine rice. The chicken was very tasty and the accompaniments cooked well. The standout for us was the Mitzo special barbecued pork. This delicious sticky BBQ char Sui pork was divine!We were also impressed the restaurant offered a supper menu available once dinner service had finished. Had we been later we would have been equally happy to order of this. Tasty meal in a modern setting with great service. Would definitely recommend

Both my partner & i love to eat cha siew. So we booked a table to celebrate our anniversary at Mitzo. On reaching, we were greeted by name which welcomed us tremendously. Food & presentation were fantastic and delicious. However, there were little flies flying near our table which was a little distracting

First impression upon entering - I entered a bar.We were shown to our seats and it seemed like we were the only people there. Later I realised there were other tables at other sections of the restaurant that was completely hidden by the glass panels. So that evoked a feeling of privacy as each section is rather small, housing probably 6 tables.After some wait to be served, our food came very quickly. Every dish we ordered, although small in serving, was very delicious and exquisite. I must say it is one of the finest Chinese food I have tasted.And like what some other reviewers mentioned, do not leave the place without ordering their mocktails. Aslam, the bartender, concocts really good mocktails, each glass customised based on the guest's preference

First impression was amazing, almost could not believe it is a Chinese restaurant. It is a fusion restaurant with Chinese dishes as main theme. The service was great and came with recommendations that are not always sales pushing for the expensive stuff but the good tasting ones. Be prepare the price is a bit high because of the location as you can expect. Portion can be consider small if you are used to dine on big platter. As I have tried a few dishes seems like their specialty is in roasted meats. I especially like the roasted pork and ducks. The techniques used for cooking these dishes are worth a try. Mentally you have to throw you standard expectation of Chinese dishes before you try this out

This is a sophisticated and beautiful restaurant which gives an immediate impression of colour and spaciousness that is sustained as one proceeds deeper into the long room. Tall glass panels tinted in various hues that divide the long space into smaller intimate areas; full height glass windows overlooking Orchard Road; tasteful mirrored ceilings; fresh and attractive soft furnishings; imaginative lighting.....Mitzo has the most creative decor of any restaurant I've been to in a long time, completely unique for a Chinese restaurant. We had the $28++ "have a break" 4 course set lunch. This was served very quickly as the restaurant had promised - good for people in a hurry - with all the courses arriving at the same time. The ingredients used in our dishes were basic (eg crabstick starter and dory fish main), but this was the lowest cost set lunch, and we had no cause to complain. The food tasted and looked good. The cooking was above average, and the presentation had an elegant, contemporary, simplicity that was pleasing. Each set lunch course could be upgraded for an extra cost (eg to a duck starter or a scallop main course etc), ranging from $5 for a starter to $14 for a main course. An upgrade of all four courses would potentially have added up to an additional $32. We might visit again to try the relatively large a-la-carte menu, which showcases the chef's repertoire and creativity, although prices looked somewhat steep. Dishes range from traditional Cantonese favourites to some interesting offerings that I've never encountered before. There is also an extensive range of cocktails, and Mitzo's hipness quotient is upped by a dramatically lit bar area with a large aquarium of ornamental jellyfish. The wait staff were personable and friendly (one bounded into the room with a semi-pirouette to greet a familiar customer), and lunching here was a pleasant experience

Went for a wine dinner mid-week, mid-April before its official opening. Did not spot any other patrons on the way in, only 2 on the way out quite late. Decor is cocktail bar/modern Asian with lots of glass. We were a big party in a large private room facing a jellyfish tank.Food was good to impressive, Cantonese with modern touches. Service was very good, particularly the wine service which managed to keep up.Would I go back? Probably not by my own choice as I stick to favourites. If you are looking for something different in Chinese dining along Orchard Road, this is worth a try
