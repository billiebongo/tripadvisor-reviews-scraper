This one-stall wonder is found in Japan Besar Food Centre, which runs parallel to Serangoon road. Nick Soon, a formal financial consultant learnt the art of making savoury steamed dumplings from his parents. I would recommend this vegetarian dumpling for breakfast or for a light lunch.Nick makes 3-4 varieties of dumplings:Koo Chye Kueh (steamed chive dumpling), Peng Kueh, Carrot Kueh and popular favourite, Soon Kueh. A hallmark of this Nick's dumpling is the almost almost transparent paper-thin skin, through which you can see the steamed turnip, chives and shrimp. While most places mass-manufacture Soon Kush with thick doughy skins, each dumpling at Nick's is hand-made.Due to the intensive preparation time for the ingredients and the huge number of telephone orders, One Kueh at a Time is open from Wednesday to Saturday, when Nick may have an extra pair of hands assisting him.I would recommend visitors from abroad to sit outside his stall (spacious and breezy) and watch Jalan Besar over a cup of iced coffee (Kopi ping) and have a dozen dumplings with the chili sauce or black sauce.Nick also accepts small group bookings on a dumping making master class this stall, which would be fun for families with children, or for anyone to feel Straits Chinese culture squishing through their fingers
