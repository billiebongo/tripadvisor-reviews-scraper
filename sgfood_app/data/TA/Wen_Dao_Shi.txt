Wide selection and variety of dishes to choose from. Come early otherwise expect to be seated outside the stall or to wait longer. Avoid coming in big group, hard to find seats.

Local restaurant where you sit on plastic stools and share tables. No frills, no fuss just great food at a reasonable price. No alcohol. Open 24hrs.

It is a neighbourhood store in one of the shop house at Geylang. 24 hours operations and very crowded in the morning, especially weekends and public holidays. No reservation, but the queue move rather fast (10 minutes +/-). If you drive, you could park along Lorong 17. There are hundreds of dim sum items, for dinning in or take-out. The indoor and outdoor seating could accommodate about 100+ guests. Don't expect any ambience, excellence service or high hygiene standard. It is simply efficient and a good fix to your craving of authentic Hong Kong dim sum. Less than S$10 per head

We had 10 dishes ranging from Pork, Prawn, Crab Fried Rice, Soft Shell Crab and all were delicious. The Sugar Cane and Guava drinks were very cold and refreshing. The only drawback was the seating on small stools was a little uncomfortable after a while. The place was packed showing the demand for this Dumpling style food. The total bill for four big eaters was only $66.

Funny that the previous reviewer had such a bad experience when I had a good food experience here when I came here for dinner with my family last Sunday. There were a variety of food including Today's Special (written in Chinese on a whiteboard- so if you can't read Chinese like me, just cross reference the No. with the Menu). The vermicelli (Tang Hoon) was good, so is the mango salad prawn fritters. Do pay a visit if you are within the vicinity. The drinks (eg barley, lime juice) are served in a plastic tupperware

I was looking thru Geylang for a place to eat breakfast when I stumbled upon this place when in TA it's given an average 4 stars. Mostly people said it's delicious and whatnot. Worth it yada yada. And off and on I saw a review or two that gave 2 stars or 1. Looking at them, and thought maybe these are naysayers. So I went ahead. Looked at menu, and its choices. I thought to myself, this is a 24-hour shop, how is it possible they have everything that displayed. So I proceeded to order. Of the 5 things I ordered, 2 was out, which was the Pao (dumpling). Come on. In the morning, Pao! How can you be out of them? Then came the meals. It's damn small. Nowhere close to what shown on the menu. And it's bloody expensive to think of the portion of the meal. On average it's $4 per plate. This is probably the worst breakfast I have in Singapore, considering the setup and food quality, the price is just too much.

Ordered the:1) sliced fish porridge2) mini pork bun3) friend man tou with chilli crab sauce4) prawn siew mai5) prawn chee cheong fun6) potato prawn rollEverything was really tasty, esp the sliced fish porridge. Prawn siew mai was not worth it coz the pieces were small. The gravy for the prawn chee cheong fun was not your usual kind; didn't really take to it. But overall the food was great! The ship had an authentic HK cafe feel to it

If you thought authentic Singapore disappeared with street hawkers and the bum boat, look again. Wash down endless steaming plates of deliciousness with huge cups of killer lime juice ah or sugar cane, sitting on a plastic chair surrounded by flip-flop clad locals at all hours, day or night. Well worth a detour

126 Dim Sum Wen Dao Shi (搵到食) serves good Dim Sum even at night. Parking car can be challenging due to its location, and being red light district you would expect more cars and human traffic somehow. But the resturant is able to hold up to 50 pax at one go. Also the food portion is meant to be small as liken to the cantonese phrase - Dim Sum (meaning "dot", "heart" - satisfy your heart a little with small portion.) This place sells small dumplings, usually steamed or fried with meat, seafood, vegetables, condiments, etc. A place for food lovers and supper with friends and loved ones

Supper place that opens late and always packed with people that wants to eat at night - that's the scene in singapore every night.Read great reviews but the place is overrated. A big menu with photos that makes it easier for tourists. The food is sloppily prepared, not fantastic in taste. The utensils will need to be cleaned as they are washed hurriedly.I don't think I would go there again

I ordered 5-6 things to try but the only 2 dishes thats worth to eat are Siew mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) and porridge with century egg. The rest were not so good or pretty normal (fried chicken-shripm hor fun-pork ribs-bbq pork bun).

Good signature fried tofu with mango salad dressing. Unique Bowl serving of sugarcane juice and longan with sea coconut.
4
We visited for supper at 12.30am and it was very crowded, almost full house. The dim sum was tasty and good. The Mantou with chilly crab sauce is definitely a highlight. Their drinks are big in serving. A little pricey though.

Different from HK as it blends China, HK styles dim sum with those of local Chinese settlers' taste like teochew and hokkien.
2
Not the dim sum I expected it to be as I saw people queuing at night for it. Slightly overpriced for the food quality.

Popped in for dinner to this place as it's well known with locals and this place never closes.It's open 24hrs a day.Relatively inexpensive options. They give you a photo album with menu items that are numbered which you write down on your order pad.Depending on the time that you go, there might be a long wait but we got our order in about 10 minutes.Loud and bustling with conversation.About $40 for 10 items picked from the menu and we left very full

This shop is actually quite reputed among locals. Maybe because it contains some memory. However, if you bump into any shop/restaurant selling dim sum in Singapore, you have more than 50% chance ending up with a better one than here.The food quality and flavour really disappointed me. They did not put their attention, energy and focus on making the food. Shrimp dumplings were dry and shrimp was hard. Most important of all, their Liu Sha Bao, maybe were bought from supermarket. But what I can be sure is that they didn't really put in much salted egg yolk inside. Just using the cheapest material and make sure inside the Bao the stuff is YELLOW. It doesn't flow!!It's not the worst though, still has room to get worse. If this is a normal shop, I will give 3. But here is so famous, the shop should have more attention and respect for the food they are making since for them the technique is not a problem any more.

My wife and I chanced upon this place by Googling "dim sum near us" at East Coast Park... and what a find this was! :) We love the slightly cramped and noisy setting; we love that we needed to walk through thick, greasy plastic hanging strips that separate the outdoors from the inside; we love the "oh you're here, have some food, then pay and go" service they do. No, we're not masochistic... we just love how unpretentious, and slightly reminiscent of HK this place is. Plus (big plus), the food is good. What we enjoyed, and will eat again and again: century egg congee, king siew mai, braised pork ribs, braised chicken feet, HK style char-siew bun, Teochew style chives dumpling (one of the handwritten specials on the wall). Ask for a pot of Chinese tea to wash down the greasiness. Rinse and repeat. Love it. Highly recommended. Nothing too fancy. For the price, very good food. We've returned a couple times, and we'll certainly bring our kids in future

This is the kind of coffee shop which should appear in '10 hidden gems in singapore' reviews. They serve amazing dim sum at very reasonable prices. Had their seafood white beehoon. Looked bland upon it's service, but it was savoury and generous with scallops and prawns. Will definitely go back again

There is nothing special about this restaurant itself. In fact, it's quite a shabby place - your typical hawker restaurant. Service is also very basic but adequate and food came at a reasonable period of time.However, the dim sum selections on offer are delicious! I lost count on what we ate as we ordered quite a lot of food. Between seven hungry girls, we spent $105 on food and drinks. Now THAT's value for money! The sugarcane with lemon drink is so refreshing in the hot and humid Singapore. They don't allow reservation so best go earlier than the normal meal times to beat the queue. Go hungry! :
