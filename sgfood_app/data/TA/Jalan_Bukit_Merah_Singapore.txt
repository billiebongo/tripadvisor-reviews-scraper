Value for money. The broth is rich and delicious, not forgetting its house made chilli powder! Do ask owner for whats on the menu. He can do cooking for you.

 Parking is not easy to find because lots of locals come here so good luck. Favorites for good eats are cereal coated prawns, fish head curry, sting ray, salted egg sauce with pork ribs ( closed Tuesday ) but the other stall on inner lane is good too. Carrot cake, satay, fresh fruit juice and shave ice help fill you fast. Enjoy the flavors. Pls bring wet wipes. Washrooms are not great but you are there for the real foods of Singapore.

You will find the best local snack of ang ku kueh (with an assortment of fillings and each in a different colour) at a traditional shop Lim Lam Hong in the area. These are the best in town in terms of taste and texture, way better than the better known ones from Everton Park

Any tourist new to Singapore wanting to experience what real Singapore food is without breaking the bank should visit this place. As a kid I ate at this place, and when I come back to Singapore to visit I have grown to appreciate this humble hawker center. It is nothing like the commercialized "food centres" in the main areas of Singapore like Lau Pa Sat; they have nothing against this place. This hawker center's atmosphere is old and utilitarian with cheap plastic chairs and tables, but not "intentionally" so, like in some more commercialized hawker centers. The last time I visited I tasted laksa worthy of a fine restaurant for just S$3.50. Near-raw cockles were placed in steaming, thin al dente rice noodles in a spicy seafood soup of fish cake and prawns (though, I must concede, a bit spicy for my taste). A few tips: While the food may be arguably 5-star, don't expect 5-star service; it is a hawker center. And like most hawker centers, they are not air-conditioned and is a bit dinky-looking. If you do not mind this, this is a great, authentic Singapore hawker center untouched by modern Singapore
