We came here on the recommendation of my three year old son. He just got tired of waiting and picked a place for us. It was a great choice. It doesn't look like a great deal - it's frantic and spartan, with a front that opens up right onto the street, but the place is very popular with the locals and for good reason - the food is excellent and very good value by Singaporean standards. It's a bit confusing - there's a buffet and an a la carte menu with many items (some of which might not be available) but the service was friendly, helpful and guided me to some new and very tasty dishes. Best Indian food I've had since I was last in England
