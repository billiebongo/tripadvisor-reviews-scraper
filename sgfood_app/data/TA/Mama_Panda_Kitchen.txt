we ordered coffee and bun with panda face on it. Even though my girl was full, she loved the bun and it was amusing. The quality of my order was good and it was a plasant place to take a break with a river view.
4
We have eaten in here once, it is a very simple cheap restaurant. No bell and whistles, but the food is good. We particularly like the soup dumplings. We usually order take away
2
It's a fast food counter concept except that the food cannot be ready made fast. Long waiting time for food during lunch time on a weekday. Definitely overpriced too.
4
Get your panda bao here. They are super cute and tasty too. You get to choose between a red bean one and a chocolate one. A bit pricey but since it is exclusive to the park, I guess it is fine.
4
It is a small little cafe serving very decent food in a very convenient location with a very reasonable pricing. If you are hungry and you happen to visit the Singapore Zoological Gardens, drop by, take a break and savour some good food here.
4
My "grown-up" daughters wanted to taste the Panda bun here so induced by them we went and tasted the food which was good! Prices were OK too!
Would recommend visitirs to Singapore Zoological Gardens not to miss this restaurant.
3
Nice small cafe in convenient location, food is good and filling. This was the perfect location for a relaxing coffee break and some yummy treats. Noting too extravagant but it surely his the spot!

If you had not tried the Panda Buns, you should. Despite it being very expensive, but what else can you expect from a tourist spot right? At least give it a try. The buns are smooth and although the fillings are not much, they blend in pretty good. The buns themselves are actually pretty great for photo.I tried the half spring chicken. It is not bad, but the green sauce really tasted weird for me. Maybe it is a things somewhere else, but really I had tasted nothing like that and I do not think it goes well with the chicken at all. Give me my tomato or chilli anyday. But it is still an experience.If you do not have much of a choice but to dine, this is probably the best place in River Safari

One of the biggest highlights of the River Safari is the panda enclosure, which (though there are red pandas as well) is dominated by two giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They can be seen sleeping and eating and generally pottering about; if they decide to be shy, you can spy on them through a CCTV feed; there’s a large souvenir shop devoted mostly to giant panda-related memorabilia; and there’s the Mama Panda Kitchen restaurant, right after. While this restaurant does offer main meals and snacks of different kinds (all mostly local cuisine), we—since we’d had a late breakfast and it wasn’t time for lunch yet—settled for Mama Panda’s somewhat kitschy coffee-and-snack specialty: the giant panda cappuccino (with a panda stencilled in coffee powder across the top) and the panda custard pau (a steamed bao filled with a chocolate custard). We paid S$18.80 for two each of the coffees and the paus. The coffees were good and strong, the paus a little low on the chocolate custard filling—but they both looked very cute, total panda kitsch. Our four-year old loved it all and was most disappointed when we stirred our coffees and drank them up

This place has the monopoly on food inside the River Safari. The noodles in the fried chicken ramen were soggy while the chicken was tasty. Pan-fried gyoza (dumpling) skin was too thick. The panda shaped treats were novel but were not that good. It seemed like they serve soft drinks in novelty cups only and you are charged a premium for it. Other cafes and restaurants are located outside the main Zoo and the Chinese restaurant at the exit of the River Safari has been replaced with a Starbucks. I guess this is it if you want to dine inside the River Safari
3
Food served are noodles, rice, wanton. Cooked in a HK style. Their sets are more worth the value. Toilet is a bit of a distance.
5
During our tour around the river safari and zoo we passed by this amazing restaurant and enjoyed a snack there. Loved it and even the kids loved their food and service. Staff are friendly and menu is in english. Great restaurant
3
Right after the river cruise, the kids were hot and hungry. This place has iced milo and chocolate-filling panda-shaped buns. Good for a short recharge!
3
It's like fast food at the zoo. The place is cute - kids love all the panda stuff, but the food is nothing amazing. Air conditioning is a plus
5
Ordered one of their famed chocolate panda cakes with a beef noodle soup and it was absolutely lovely.
5
The dim sum buns were delicious and served in the shape of a panda head.
The Latte was the best that i had in Singapore and with a panda picture in the Froth.
4
Mum long time didn't visit zoo so we bring her here to walk around and see Jiajia kai kai and new kangaroos
4
The concept for this place is really good for kids. The chairs are with Panda design and the kids like it and they also enjoyed the Panda bun.The panda bun is quite cute and it's a nice snack for a break. The coffee is also with cute Panda coffee art
2
Items price are marked very high, eg wanton noodle costs $17.90 with 1 mango pudding! Compared to zoo, you can have larger meal portion for just around $10. May be this restaurant is located near to panda area, hence they jacked up the price. Taste of noodles is below average. The only thing I would come for this restaurant is the panda boa, buns shaped like panda heads. Children will be very attracted to them. However the taste is just so so. Overall rating is poor, just go to any restaurants in the zoo rather than river safari for your meal. The only thing worth trying is the panda bun
5
Came here solely for the panda baos. I wouldn't mind paying $2.9 for this, cause where else can you get a panda bao? There's 2 flavours available- chocolate custard & red bean. I would say the red bean tastes better. Counter staff is very patient. We took a long time looking at the menu & also deciding if we wanted to add on other items, but the staff did not show any displeasure. Also, the restaurant had smaller tables at the side which has cute chairs shaped and painted as pandas. A good place to take a short tea break and enjoy the air-con
3
The chocolate panda bun is a must try. The rest of the dishes are quite tasty especially when you are hungry. The rice dishes are usually quite wet. However my Chinese friends from China finds it not too authentic but good enough for me!
3
Took a break here after our river boat trip.Nice food, quick service, and you get your free drink in a souvenir panda plastic glasses. Price is not too bad.
1
Very expensive, not value for money. But this is typical price for an eatery in a tourist attraction.
4
Must try "food" when you visited river safari in Singapore. Great location to relax after walking around in river safari. The panda pou are very sweet, average taste of Cappuccino, quite crowded in peak/holiday season.
3
Like many said, the price is triple than outside, even more expensive than the restaurants at the welcome gate. The portion is only enough for 1 adult and not too big to share. However, the restaurant design is nice with children tables if you want. Although place is small, but you can easily find a table.Take a look the menu attached and plan for your trip

This is the only proper eating place in the park. (There are food carts around the place and another restaurant at the entrance of the park) The store operates as a fast food place (place your order and collect it at the counter, find your own seats), but they are not up to par with 'fast food'. The service is very slow and the food is expensive. (price is as expected since this is a tourist attraction) We ordered very little food, just to try it out. The fried lotus roots were slightly burnt/over-fried but tasted ok.(no seasoning, so its bland) The panda bun looked super cute! We bought both the chocolate custard and the red bean version. The chocolate was not rich at all, didn't like it. The red bean version was much nicer, but more pricey compared to those I can buy at a coffee shop.(That tastes more fragrant too!

We had lunch here during our recent visit to the River Safari.The menu offers choices of main course and side dishes. We felt that the side dishes were priced reasonably, while those main course (mostly noodles and rice, with a drink and a dessert) were way too expensive, even for a tourist attraction.The side dishes we ordered, fried dumpling, pot stickers, spring rolls, were all tasty enough. The fried lotus root slices, however, were tasteless and over-fried. The Panda pau (buns) were nice.For some unknown reason, the line at the food ordering counter moved really slowly. While they had 4 counters, only one was open while we visited, and we waited for a long time before our turn, even though there were only 3 persons before us.Overall, we felt that the side dishes were OK, but otherwise this is a very expensive cafe that's not worth visiting
3
Visited The River Safari. Had afternoon tea break at Mama Panda Kitchen. It's a self service kiosk. No service. Everything you pay and collect yourself. This fast food restaurant served food related to the 2 pandas namely "Jia Jia" and "Kai Kai" showcasing in The River Safari. It's more of a kiddy place to make them happy.Recommended for families with children. Am sure they will have fun
5
Many of my friends posted cute panda baos in their Instagram. We purposely went to the River Safari to try the Mama Panda Kitchen, and of course, to see Kai Kai and Jia Jia.We were not disappointed with our visit. We enjoyed our tour watching Kai Kai and Jia Jia eating and playing in their den. They were so cute and adorable. Both kids and adults were enjoying taking photos of the Pandas.After the tour, we dine at the Mama Panda Kitchen. I love the ambience and the decoration. There were cute panda decorations everywhere.We ordered:*Beef wanton noodle soup*Panda bao (chocolate custard)*Panda bao (red bean paste)(Love both chocolate and red bean paste, especially the chocolate custard flavor. Definitely a must try!)*Big Panda Cappuccino(Not that great. However, the cuteness of the latte art, which was the Panda make it more appetizing.)Overall, Mama Panda Kitchen is a nice place to dine after touring around the River Safari. Both kids and adults will definitely love this place.

The menu choices are acceptable and this restaurant serves good red bean paste panda buns and the side dishes are rather decent. The main courses are nothing to shout about though they are alright and the prices are acceptable considering this is s tourist attraction. That is why I'm dismayed by the service offered in this restaurant. It appears as if the service crew received zero training in this respect as there is no basic service which is expected in a tourist attraction. If anything, I've had much better service from fast food restaurants and this is a shame as tourists will have a lowly impression of local service standards if this is one of the restaurants they've visited during their tour to Singapore. I hope the management of this restaurant can consider the importance of service and train her staff.

Before order we have to make a line within 15 minutes because of many people who want to eat here. But its worth when we eat the Chocolate Panda Bao, and drink giant cappucinno. With cute panda face on it.
4
This Panda Themed restaurant is inside the River Safari complex. Food is not cheap, but the Red Bean Bao which is made like a Panda's head is delicious. Drinks are also served in souvenir cups which you can keep.
4
A fun place especially for the kids. Right by the Panda enclosures and features some near Panda themed dishes (& cups). We had the Red Bean Panda Buns.
2
A Chinese quick service restaurant (self-service). Expensive with average food. A set meal is around S$17 excluding drink. The only thing cute is the panda bun.
4
If you are a panda-lover and have budget to spare, try the Mama Panda Restaurant in River Safari. The ramen and panda buns are good!
2
Located within the River Safari, it really has a captive clientele. There is a selection of sets. Meaning sets of food for example Wonton noodle with Mango Pudding, or Chicken and rice etc. The portions are small for S$18/- plus per set. The souvenir soft drink bottle with drink cost S$5/-. 2 spring rolls for S$3.90 and the list goes on. We had 4 sets, some Spring rolls, Gouza, 2 soft drinks and 2 Panda Baus. The bill came to over $110/-. Quality was ok, not great. But I guess one has a choice to not eat there
4
The panda bun is a must-try!!! It comes in cute panda face shape with ears, nose, and everything. There are 2 fillings to choose from: red bean paste, and chocolate custard. Both are really good though they are quite sweet you would need hot tea or coffee to go with it
4
If your going to the night safari then check out the Bongo bar for tea first. The night safari does not open until 7.00pm but the zoo (next door) closes at 5.30pm so most people have an hour and a half to kill before they can get in. Not much point in going back to town so have a burger while watching the amazing Thumbuakar Performance which is in the the entrance plaza of the night safari.Thumbuakar is a spectacular fire show that can be enjoyed outdoors with a burger and beer from the Bongo Bar
3
We order the fried dumpling, Siew mai, Pandan Bun etc. But i only like the Panda Bun and Coffee. The fried dumpling was too oily. Just grab some small bite and seat outside the restaurant to relax with the nice scenery. You can even see giffares which located in the Zoo
3
Their food is not so special but their Panda Bao really nice. While it hot is nice even when it become cold still nice. The bao still soft and not turn harder.Other than that we order set meal. We order bamboo chicken with mushroom. It comes with soup (i choose corn soup) and dessert (they provide mango pudding). The bamboo chicken taste nice. Chicken tasty and tender.I also order fried wanton that i think too oily
5
This is a fast food joint with panda style kids food and very clean . Enjoy won tons in a climate controlled room before heading back into the humidity .
5
Their panda pao is really good, soft, taste good specially when it is still hot. Nuggets is good also.
4
I love the Chocolate and Red bean buns, it was simply tasty! But the restaurant was big but the place was very cramp.
3
I had the wanton noodles and was disappointed with the expensive and bland food. The signature dish is the cute panda bun.

Got a few items and these are really park food prices. The food is not great but the Panda buns were very cute.
5
Everything here is adorable - from the panda murals on the wall to the chairs, Mama's Panda Kitchen is a great concept cafe! We went in at about 4.45pm after visiting River Safari for a snack and were quite happy to find it relatively empty. Service was polite and quick, which was great. I ordered a chocolate bao, which came out like a panda's face - it was hot and delicious. I could have had five of them!! My sister's capaccino came with a cocoa picture of a panda on it - also very cool. It's not too expensive and we were able to really enjoy the last couple of minutes we had at the Zoo. A great stop over at the end of the day
2
Came here to get the panda baos but was disappointed with the service. Only one counter was opened on a Saturday afternoon. There were quite a number of staff in the back kitchen just standing and looking at us while waiting for orders to be taken at the front. The queue was quite bad and there wasn't any proper staff management at all. Furthermore the staff were all showing black faces and not welcoming at all. I hope the reason to this is that they are still new. The panda bun tasted average but worth a photo taken
4
This is just after the panda exhibit. Wonderful stop. Food is so-so but the panda baos are a draw with the children. The latte is servied with latte art featuring pandas.Just outside is a glass viewing panel where you can see Inuka, the polar bear play in the water. She is in the main zoo. What a better way to entice you to return for the main zoo
3
It was a pleasant surprise to see Mama Pandas Kitchen for a quick cup of coffee and the famous Panda 'Paus' bun. Its about three quarters of the way through the River Safari trail, over looking the river. The coffee cups were the size of a soup bowl and it was blended well, the Panda 'Paus' was yummi and fresh. It was a good Pit Stop for a long walk. Do stop here.

This eatery outlet is located outside the Giant Panda Courtyard, inside the River Safari Compound.This is walking distance to the River Rides, therefore you have a nice view of the river as you dine.The place is quite spaceous and cooling. Quite a nice place to take a short rest after the first half of the journey before you proceed to the second half of the Wild Amazonia and Squirrel Monkey Forest.The food there are quite limited and the prices are relatively on the high side. Their signature dish is the cute Panda paus, served hot and soft with a choice of red beans and custard fillings. They served big cups for cuppa, but as a coffee lover, the cuppa was quite on the light taste. An extra shot of esspresso will be perfect.If you purchase a soft drink, you could also bring home the nice cup with prints of the R/S animals on it. The kids will love it.They also serves foods like Bamboo Rice, Prawn Dumplings, Wanton Noodles and Panda Paus, cold and hot drinks, etc. There is a self-service table where you could choose your choice of chillies, spices and sauces for your food.The counter crews are quite friendly but they served food fast. That I gave them an "A".Companies could also booked this place for light functions too
