Actually quite fancy, and nice location in a park. Decent outdoor area as well. However, beers rather bland as there is only the basic range.
4
Went with a few work colleagues and found KPO a great place for drinks and tapas. The place has a great buzz and all of the food we got was delicious (satay, wings, pizza, etc.) all in all a great spot for drinks!
5
We ordered a variety of starters and mains! Loved the prawns and the lamb. Good music and loved the ambience.
5
Great local bar! Had the pizza and a KPO Special cocktail. Very fun environment with good music. Visited on a Wednesday night and it was extremely lively. If you want a good place to get to know the local scene in Singapore then you wonâ€™t want to miss going here
4
Located in a nice area of Singapore. Visited after work a couple times and enjoyed the wings and beers. The wings had a great taste with light breading. Also tried the fries which were great. Service was just OK, needed to flag down the server to order additional drinks and food.At night it turns into more of a club atmosphere which would be fun if you're looking for that sort of thing
5
Not much of a live music venue fan but would make an exception for this venue. Great space to gather over delicious food and a great range of beers. Asahi black was a revelation. We moved indoors and live band sound was fantastic. Must have spent a lot and planned the music system really well. Spent a lot longer here than planned on a great night out
4
The new band is really good! Plays good music too. A tad loud though and can be difficult to talk when the band is playing. It's the first time I find the food in a club so happening!! The dishes are amazing. The roast pork, hokkien mee, mini burgers and the pizza selections are amazing. So good for drinks with friends and good for food. Absolutely recommend it. Parking is hell though! Park opposite in Orchard Central
4
So food was okay with a lot of snack food. But the reason to come is not for the food but the drinks and live music. Personally I didn't like the range of wines that much. The live music was great though and that really made the place very enjoyable.
4
Went with a few female friends and they loved it. According to them there was no shortage of well heeled charming rich guys. I was of course bored by the lack of female population. The bathrooms are unisex and there is always a line. It's a fun place to hangout overall
3
Decided to pop in for quick beer whilst exploring the city.Service in this bar seems to be quite slow, at least it was downstairs. Sat at the bar for about 5-10 mins being ignored despite several staff standing chatting a few feet away, it must have been quite obvious I wanted a drink, but they didn't come over until I started waving quite wildly at them! They weren't serving anyone else, just chatting amongst themselves, which didn't create a great first impression.Upstairs bar service was more attentive.Outside area was closed off for a private party and nearly every table inside had a reserved sign on it so do be prepared for the struggle of finding somewhere to sit if you want to go downstairs where the music is. When I asked if the tables were really all reserved I was told quite bluntly 'yes, why don't you check if there are tables upstairs'.Don't think I would return as there must be better bars around
4
We were looking for something out of a mall in Singapore to have a drink and an easy dinner. This place we good. Lots of choices in beer and wine, good food and atmosphere.
4
Went here looking for cheap beer during happy hour (circa $10SGD) good lively busy place, staff helpful, food good too. Would definitely return. Gets a bit loud downstairs in the bar when the live band are on.
5
Good band, good DJ music, beautiful architecture, good local and International foods. Double stories w pockets of comfortable spaces for smokers to chill. What's there not to like?
1
Went here with a group of girl friends. The service was terrible. The drinks were weak. We ordered vodka tonics and they tasted of nothing at all. The staff were surly and one behind the bar was downright rude.
4
Went there with my friends. Great songs were played that day! Good beers with very good price! Lovely staff!

ordered 50cl of Strongbow cider, asked for no ice. it arrived in a US 16oz rounded glass, with the liquid level about an inch below the top. US 16oz is 473 ml, so by serving it in a US 16oz glass, you're already shortchanging the customer. Next, it was an inch below, which means you only really serve about 40cl of liquid. Mark, the manager, insisted that a full glass includes the ice, which is ridiculous. i pointed out that the drink menu specifies 50cl of cider, and not 473 ml including ice. he then said the menu doesn't state everything. even if you gave me a full glass, that's still 25ml below what you claim to be selling. this is cheating on measures, and you thus cheat your customers of about 20% of the drink. i refused to take it, so i ordered 50cl of Erdinger instead - because the glass has a line for 50cl. it's a pretty sad state of affairs when your customer chooses his drink based on the glass marking to ensure he gets what he paid for. drink arrived, i paid in cash. change came back. ok.at 9:45 p.m. i ordered another 50cl of Erdinger. $16 so i didn't want to wait for the bill to come so i handed the server $50 in cash. i spent the next two hours waiting for my change and reminding staff to being my change. eventually the waitress brought Mark (the same crap manager) and they had to ask me whether i ordered one or two pints. eventually my $34 in change came back at 12.15 a.m. the waitress whom i'd asked several times and who eventually brought my change was in a pink teeshirt, wore no makeup, didn't wear glasses, and had short wavy hair not tied up. she was deeply apologetic. i'd spent over two hours waiting and chasing for my change while all the folk around me in my large group got their bills slowly but still within 30 minutes. 12:15 p.m. was past last trains and buses, so while i'd ordered my last drink and finished it well in time to go home by public transport, i now had to take a taxi.sure, Friday night is busy, but this sort of inefficiency and incompetence is inexcusable. i asked to see Mark the manager - who refused to see me. i'd seen the waitress (pink teeshirt, chinese girl, lipstick, round glasses, hair tied up) i informed go and tell him to come out, and i saw him quite clearly behind the bar irritatedly waving her to leave me alone. the girl waitress then found another gentleman (Chinese, about 40, black uniform) who came to apologize. i said because of their inefficiency and incompetence i had to get a cab home when i should have received my change long ago. he offered me a drink on the house but what was the point? i've worked in bars and restaurants, some even busier than KPO on a Friday night, so i know what is humanly possible. this was utterly ridiculous, among the worst service i have ever received in Singapore. AVOID THIS PLACE
1
Went here to meet a friend. Upon arrival arrival 10th mins eventually managed to order a few drinks after spending 15 minutes trying to get someone's attention. Friends drink came in 10 mins. Next they took my credit card as I wanted a tab. This goes again credit card recommendation, do they let it out of your sight. Still waiting for my first drink after 35 minutes. So gave e up went bar and spoke to pretty rude guy who wouldn't give me my credit card back till I got my phone out and said I was calling the police. One to avoid.
1
As i am writing now, my bill has not arrived since 45 mins. And when it came 15 mins ago, it was billed wrongly instead of what was mentioned 40% off for ladies night. I do not understand why it's so slow. In fact next table is complaining the same thing and almost got into a fight. Come at ur own peril
4
We found this place by chance near our hotel at the high end of Orchard Road It was then our local very friendly waitress service and great live music Did not eat here so can not comment It is also frequented by locals which is always a good sig
3
Kpo is a bar which turns into a very loud late bar at night serving the usual beers, cocktails and alright food at Singapore prices.Frequented more by locals than expats, it always comes across as 'one of the places to be' / rather pretentious / trying too hard (the people, anyway), but it's also one of the few bars that are open pretty late in the neighbourhood now (especially since Muddies moved back to its original home), so this is a bonus. Also KPO does very good burgers. Worth trying out, but better options not too far away.
4
The food is good and the offer is excellent especially during saturdays. would have given them 5 stars, but they were not accommodative despite my reservation.
4
A nice pub with a good selection of beers. Make sure you try the local brew 'Tiger' a very nice lager. Tried out the bar meals, steaks, which were very tasty but the service was a little slow. It is a very busy bar obviously very popular with the locals
3
Dropped in after seeing the outside and being intrigued. Wish I hadn't! The wine by the glass list consists of 2 white and 2 red, no rose. The whiskey menu is massive but I don't drink whiskey. Didn't try the food but looks very Aussie pub grub. Terribly dated music - 'Islands in the stream' just came on. Pricey cocktails. Staff have limited communication skills and as usual poor customer engagement. Good location, nights suit for a beer and pizza night but Iwon't be back again.
5
Location just off orchard is great. The drinks were good and prices 'ok for Singapore'. The food was outstanding. Service was not that great. Slow with even basic requests. The bill took forever to come even with an empty bar. Space for improvement but still great place.
1
Don't bother going down... I tried to call about 6 times but they never answer. Head down to the bar itself to place my reservations and they took down my number, was informed that a stuff will contact me to confirm my reservation the following day but that did not happen. I tried to call a final time and finally they answered. But to my surprise, the stuff that answered have such a bad phone ethic. Don't bother going down as they do not even have a host to welcome u there. Don't waste your time people
4
Went there for the 1st time for a friend's bday bash.Am quite amazed with the interior & the vibes there. Love it! Though the music is quite loud.We ordered drinks & foods.Surprisingly they also serve tzi char style of foods in a better way.The sweet & sour pork is delish, while the chicken wings is quite ok
1
I have been in Singapore for a long time now and never been to KPO but the chance arose last night to drop by with a colleague from Spain who was having a last drink before heading home. We arrived while still quiet but obviously it got busier quite quickly as was around 5pm. It was obvious there is a regular crowd with reserved tables etc etc. The place looks great, really good selection of draft beer and spirits so in my mind perfect combination. The one thing that will make me never ever return is the absolutely disrespectful attitude of the bar staff... Two staff in particular were very rude but I wont go into details. For a start glasses can remain empty even when sat at the bar and when you ask for another drink you are glared at as if you are asking for something strange, no can I help, what would you like, please, thank you just a what, yes, and a look as if it was something out of the ordinary we wanted, sadly a very common occurrence in Singapore now but for such a nice place with great selection of drinks it is sad to be let down by service. This was the 4th experience in 3 days this visitor who was here for the first time had experienced bad service so not such a good first impressionIf you are a regular here or are willing to spend time becoming a regular I think you may end up liking it, if a visitor from overseas head to Emerald Hill on the other side of Orchard where the reception was much better.Sadly even though everything else here was great for the simple fact certain staff have no manners I would never recommend
2
Nice building but really unfriendly unless you are a regular... and good luck trying to become a regular, because they hold all the empty tables on "reserve" and will only put you outside or at a crappy table if you just walk in... very unfriendly - spend you money elsewhere!
4
Went with friends to this watering hole on Wednesday (Ladies night with 50% for the girls) and enjoyed it very much. Busy place both inside and out. When the music was playing, or the live band, it was still possible to have a conversation which is not really very common anymore. 50% on drinks for girls means really reasonable bottle prices for Singapor
4
Met up with some old friends here almost on yearly basis now.Its located at one of the junction along Orchard Road next to Orchard Central.It has indoor and outdoor seating and 1st floor terrace seating.Ordered some beer and bourbon for drinks. And some Chicken Wings, deep fried Squid Rings and 3 type of Sausages.What can I say. Great location & place, great atmosphere, great companies and good food and drinks.Great place to meet up & hang out
4
KPO is a decent place to hang out after work etc, yuppies n working type fill up at 6-7pm on days like wed n Friday.
A plus is their decent food menu, with good local fare. highlights include the Nasi Lemak n hokkien mee.
5
A nice place to rest after a long walk through the streets of Singapore ן found a place to rest drinking beer and smoking.
5
Great place for a cold beer just off Orchard, good specials on food & drinks through the week. Indoors outside seating, also has separate smoking area that didn't impact on us enjoying our time outside. Big thumbs up to the staff too, very friendly
5
Great place for beer and music. Although beer can be ££ to UK standards. As we were only there for 2 nights we didn't mind at all. Pretty loud music upstairs and downstairs - wouldnt sit outside as its full of bugs.  Has a young feel - feels like its aimed at 20 - 40 year olds. Not sure my grandparents would like this place
5
Spent last Saturday night here, we were looking for a place to have drinks and a little pub food. The place has a couple of porches for al fresco dining/drinking. I liked the vibe as it was lively but you can still carry a conversation (from where we sat outside overlooking Killiney rd.)The only food I got to try was the bacon cheeseburger (SGD 18 as of this posting) kind of pricey for a burger for me, but this is Singapore.... and IT WAS GOOD!They had a one for one deal on the beers (SGD 12 per 25cl as of this posting of I remember correctly) so that was a pretty good deal since we're beer drinkers. The service was great! The serving staff (Alvin) who attended to us was very accommodating and efficient.I liked this place for its atmosphere, vibe, price and service. Definitely a must if you enjoy having a drink on a porch with greenery around. We will be coming back! Thanks to KPO and their staff
2
Nice place to grab a beer, but I won't recommend eating here. Quality of food is average, the most, way overpriced. We ordered 15sgd bowl of chips which turned out to be very small portion, which you would generally get for free
4
Came last saturday night and was greeted by a friendly chinese girl. Sat down on the sofa and ordered Erdinger. KPO on saturday night has one of the best deal in town. 1 for 1 beer. $16nett for 2 pints of Erdinger weis! I suppose no where in Singapore i could find such a good deal. Food wise is okay, considering the amount being served is just nice. Not too filling. Disappointing part is while calling for bill and i waited for more then 15minutes. Overall a nice experience. Will be back

Day One of a short visit to Singapore with my wife. We met briefly for lunch before she resumed her retail therapy leaving me to my own devices.I found this excellent Pub close to our hotel and stepped in for a beer. The drinks menu is just awesome - a range of draught beers, bottled beers/cider, KPO signature cocktails, single malts, spirits, champagne, port, sherry, tequila, et al.They also serve food and have an outdoor terrace as well as an upper level. Being by myself, I sat at the bar and drank a couple of pints of Old Speckled Hen - reasonable fare at Singapore Dollars 14/- a pint.The place was buzzing being after work hours. I would not mind revisiting KPO before we leave town
1
It has been 5 years since my last visit to KPO. We visited KPO on a Wednesday night at 6.45pm, and to our surprise, the place was quite packed. We ordered 2 signature cocktails, a smoked duck pizza and steak & eggs.Firstly, the drinks were very diluted. Secondly, the smoked duck pizza was just mediocre. It did not have much flavour, and I could not see if there was any sauce used as a base. Thirldly, the steak was extremely tough to chew. Next, when we ordered our drinks, we were told that we would enjoy a 50% discount since it was Ladies Night. When our bill arrived, it did not reflect the discount. It took a long time for the service staff to change the bill and bring it back to us. This was unacceptable, given that the female staff at the cashier was free and lazy to bring the bill to us. In conclusion, the service at KPO is slow, the place is cramped and the music is way too loud for my liking. The food and drinks here are mediocre. There are better places in Singapore for drinking
1
Always liked KPO's food, drinks and ambience. But yesterday's experience killed it. Waited 40 minutes and food is not served. Checked several times with the staffs and was asked to just wait. All other tables which placed orders after us were served. I was also asked to redeem my entertainer deal upon placing order. But we were so frustrated and hungry after more than 40 minutes of waiting that we just decided to leave. Really upset by the experience. Hope it's a one-off understaff situation
4
it's either you come here early or after 10pm if you want a decent place with good and comfortable seating. food is decent, music is great and the atmosphere is good.
3
Called around 4pm. Wasn't too busy. Staff were friendly & attentive. Nice atmosphere. Unable to get Erdinger by the 1/2 pint though!
4
I went into KPO just after we finished work together with a few colleagues. Beers and drinks are okay and so is the staff. It is a nice bar but just nothing exciting to get a "excellent" vote.
5
We found it difficult to find somewhere open after 11pm in the orchard road area but kpo did not disappoint. It's a bit pricey but even at midnight the food was fresh and delicious!
4
By Singapore standards not silly prices ($12 a beer compared to $18 in Clark Quay) and decent food.
Close to Orchard Road so you can escape the shopping madness.
Nice live music.
4
After a positive experience on the last visit I came here again with some friends for a few drinks. Once again we didn't try the food, but the Erdinger beers were very good. Service was friendly and fast in taking orders, but the drinks took quite a while to arrive
5
We ran in here of chance , thinking it was a dive bar or pub, and the sky's were about to open, as we walked in the sky's did open , but that wasn't our only surprise , this place is the ducks guts , a great trendy bar, yet a little casual too, we gladly decided to be stuck here by the rain, we had several drinks , very pleasant prices , and then decided to stay for a snack, we shared the satay , great service , pleasant people , will visit again if I get the chance , indoor and outdoor spaces to

Not sure why this is listed as an attraction since it's really a bar, located next to Killiney Post Office (and hence the name, KPO). As a bar, it's a great place to have a few drinks. Prices seem quite reasonable during happy hour also, which is not always the case in Singapore
4
I came here for some drinks with a friend who I hadn't seen for many years. We visited on a Wed night, fairly early in the evening, and were able to get a table outside without any hassles. Beer prices were reasonable and service was fast (ok so it was during happy hour). We didn't try the food. The place wasn't too busy and wasn't too noisy either - I'll be back
4
Had an after business hours meeting at KPO.Few beers and snacks.Everything normal, but in a friendly atmosphere, fast service, smiles, and pretty normal prices.Moreover there was a band, an acoustic guitar duo, that was really first class, with interesting choices of songs and very nice interpretation.Pity they only stayed 1 hour.Overall a nice place, quite close to the Orchard part where most of the offices are.Will go back to try dinner.Recommended
5
One of the best and very best hokkien mee I've ever tasted. Perfect 10. Ambiance is awesome.7-10mins walk from Town. Music is really fantastic. Surely you'll love the place.
5
We went here after a team training week in Singapore. Got caught in one of Singapore's legendary downpours so all were literally soaked on arrival. Staff were really helpful and didn't mind us dripping everywhere! Great service, good beer and some very nice appetisers available.
4
Nice surprise to find good local food (chicken wings, calamari rings, fried hokkien noodles etc) - worth checking out for a chill-out session
5
Very hospital, central located on the Orchard road. Good live music.
Open terraces with smoking places
Good beer, good food.
4
Had drinks here. Lots of ppl after work chilling out. Good indoor & outdoor seating. Good live band & excellent service.
5
Dropped by for a cold beer...several beers, food...later we left.Dark surroundings but much people watching to view, either on top deck or at ground level. Food was different, tastes, blending of different types of food worked really well, eg vanilla bean ice cream with kettle fried chips and caramel topping or deep fried prawns and wasabi Mayo. Service was friendly and excellent. Wine incredibly expensive $100 bottle for a NZ red or white. Glass whiskey $25. We drank German beer half pints @$8 glass
5
If you can accept the fact that you pay too much for eating out in Singapore you'll love coming here. That said the prices are 100% backed up by the quality. So you can go to a food court in this area and be cheap, or come to KPO and get great food, service and a really good experience. #yol

I'm extremely disappointed with the service standards in KPO recently. My friend and I are frequent visitors and this is one of our favourite hangout spot in Singapore. Obviously, we are not the biggest spenders but we open bottles every time and it's always our favourite Bombay Sapphire. Recently, we have encountered 2 disappointments and in very quick succession. First, our newly bought bottle (yes, Bombay Sapphire) was claimed by the bar tender to have expired when it was only one week old. The second, which happened this evening: the bartender claimed that we finished the bottle there was clearly (clearly) more than half left just two days ago. I recommend a no-go to this outlet until they get their act together. Frustrated.
3
Ok, to be fair, the design of the place is kinda cool, but that's where it ends for me. We went for beers and snacks, but ended up staying longer than we anticipated because of the roof patio. My girlfriend ordered one type of beer and they brought another and then wouldn't accept the fact that it was not the same thing (biggest hint being the name on the bottle was different). We then ordered nasi lemak balls and they brought a normal order of nasi lemak (which was delicious). The waiter was a bit spacey on these things and never acknowledged the mistakes. Lastly, I applaud the girl trying to sing cover songs all night, but she wasn't very good. I would probably revisit this place because I don't enjoy leaving mediocre reviews, but it would be an apprehensive visit...
5
If you are around Somerset area looking for local food paired with alcohol al fresco style, this is the place for you. Try the Nasi Lemak - coconut flavoured rice with condiments such as fried chicken drumstick, peanuts & crispy fish and egg. The rice is soft and fragrant and you must eat it with the spicy sauce. Goes well with beer or whisky. The upstairs verandah in the evening is cool and relaxed. Nice part about this place is the dress code ..... there isn't any 
4
good spot to share the first drinks after dinner and partying out. Music too loud indoor so most clients escape on the terraces. Beer food served with the drinks. (chicken wings, grilled kobe beef cubes, etc)
4
This bar sits in the old Post Office on Killiney Road, right next to Orchard Road. It's a good location and very popular. A little expensive but a good choice of beers. Service is average but this place is popular and gets busy quick!
5
Enjoy nice music, cold beer , whiskey and exotic cars parked out the bar. Best chill out place in center of Orchard Road. You get to meet local Singaporeans and permanent residents here. Nice DJ spin after ten.
4
Is a place can let child get in. Very convenience we're walk about 15mins from Grand Hyatt hotel.
Comfy sofa, have snack and main course menu....price are normal not too crazy.
Love their French fries.....not the skinny small one.
5
Food was good restaurant environment was good and service was good. I think the location was great and it is value for money.
1
Came in for a beer after the movies. After ordering the beer the staff started before closing time and without giving a warning cleanup and prepare the place for closing by putting chairs on the table.This was quite offensive and obviously they first wanted us to order and then go home asap. When we said something about it there mentioned they would stop cleaning. Unfortunately they started coming back every five minutes of the drinks (half full) could be cleared.The drinks were expensive and obviously the bar is not needing any guests.Not going agai
4
With a name like that you wonder ! when you get there you stop thinking about it and focus on the drinks which are the reason you are in this place.Decent service and crowd, you can spend hours with whosoever you go with while the live music keeps you company

I have always been curious about this rooftop bar / lounge that shares the building with Killiney SingPost branch - KPO Cafe Bar. Been there at least twice so far, and still like the place.Interestingly, its name, "KPO", does not stand for the Hokkien version of being nosey ("kaypoh") nor does it stand for "Killiney Post Office" - it is actually the initials for its location, being situated at the intersection between Killiney Road, Penang Road and Orchard Road.So, this little cafe bar boosts of a totally chilled ambience - unpretentious, relaxing and simply-decorated. I always try to snag a seat on level 2 - the rooftop bar that looks more classic and romantic. The music may be a little loud though, but for the patrons, it was probably what we needed exactly - something to lose ourselves in. The DJs are pretty good. It provides the ideal place for friends to gather for drinks and bites,or colleagues to unwind after a long day's work.That night, Sylvia* and I decided to chill out there, and we were fortunate enough to get a seat at the rooftop balcony that I preferred. Outside here, music was not as loud, and we could chat over drinks, food and a cosy alfresco ambience.Besides my Mapu Cabernet Sauvignon and her Somersby Apple Cider, we shared a variety of snacks.First there was a Wasabi Prawns - tasted like they were stir-fried? Succulent and bouncy in texture, basked in the tantalizing flavors of spicy-wasabi - this is a must have for prawn lovers. They made for the perfect snacks as each prawn was shelled and bite-sized. The Pork Cubes -coated lightly with flour / biscuits, fried to a perfect crispiness. The overall texture is crispy, firm, but not hard. The taste was a light saltiness that sat well on the tongues, and I loved the bite-sized cubes as well, so easy to eat.For more detailed information and photos, please drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/chilling-out-at-kpo-cafe-bar.htm

Ok, I live in Singapore... But really, 18 $ for a kronenburg? Average beer price here in singapore is 12-15s$ so this bar obviously fancies itself a bit. However, they then tell you it's happy hour/s for that beer and now it's 13$ .... And after 8 pm because its a special offer... It's 13$ until they close.. Confused yet? Me too.... But we stayed! It was a friends choice of bar otherwise we would have walked out on site of the price list!The interior is quite a dark, moody feel...2 levels. We sat upstairs outside as one of our party smokes. It was better outside than in! Good fans, interesting to chat and watch world go by. One waiter was hopeless... Kept forgetting orders... 3 glasses of water and 3 pints of beer....the water appears the beer we had to reorder 10 mins later.... Opens till midnight... But to be honest... The Irish pub over he road looked more exciting( the dubliner)..... And if you are on a beer budget ... My advice is go to the hawker food centre and grab a jug of tiger for 16$s..... Or a 600ml chilled bottle of carlsberg for $6.But if you want a nice place to go to meet up with your buddies that might not appreciate a meet up in a hawker centre...then this bar is ok. And it's probably the best you will find on orchard road

As bars are not places that I normally frequent, this was a unique experience when a friend from 30 years back recommended we meet there.Located just next to Orchard Central shopping mall in the Orchard road shopping district, the location is very central. Our friend highly recommended the KPO Hokkien Mee as well as the Bar Chor Thin Noodles.Loved the Bar Chor Thin Noodles but thought the KPO Hokkien Mee was pretty average. Seated at the balcony, it was not as noisy and cold as sitting inside the air-conditioned area
