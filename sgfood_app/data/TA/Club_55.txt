bravo!

Great service, great selection just be prepared for the queues. Worth doing it if it is part of your package.

Prebooked an amazing evening for the family and was overwhelmed by the variety, service and spectacular views of the city.
Highly recommended for great deserts and a sky view of the city.

The club 55 was offered to us for breakfast, afternoon tea & evening canapés.
Breakfast selection was brilliant and service was unbelievable.
Afternoon tea & evening canapés selection was not good, only cold snacks etc.
Ocean view from the Club 55 was fantastic.

We did not stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel so the evening buffet seemed like a great opportunity to experience this famous location. The views are great, the service was good enough, and we enjoyed the experience. The chocolate and cheese buffet was very tasty but a bit disappointing - there wasn't a huge selection so it did leave me feeling a bit short changed as it's quite pricey. But I'm glad we went all the same
2
Whilst the views are truly beautiful.......If you are looking for a romantic afternoon tea experience to be looked after and celebrate all foods this is not for you. lack of care from staff, queues and disorganized chaos you can do better and we as clients expect better from a well known oversized ego hotel such as the Marina Bay sands

I had my breakfast and evening snacks at this club lounge while staying in the hotel. The staff were courteous and served with smile. Enjoyed the food and drinks here along with the awesome view the restaurant provided on the 55th floor. The breakfast buffet spread could have been wider covering more cuisines.
5
We had afternoon tea and evening cocktails here.The food was scrumptious, there was a lot of variety and the presentation and quality were very good.The service was exceptionally high standard and the staff were very polite and made it a pleasant experience.Special efforts were made for my dietary requirements.  The views from the dinning area are fabulous. The skyline of Singapore is brilliant

I was so looking forward to this. We even made a reservation weeks in advance to insure we got a table! What great reviews! It was a special night, as we were celebrating an early Christmas treat together. I was expecting a lot more, whereâ€™s the chocolate fountain? It was basically about 4 displays of chocolate and some cheese options. I was not wowed or impressed at all and was actually embarrassed that I talked my family into coming here.. I thought we would be here for hours enjoying the wonderful chocolate selections. We spent 30 minutes here, and saw and tasted it all. The chocolate we tried was good, but it was no experience. Just a average dessert table . The service was excellent and they treated us very well which ups my review. I would not recommend this . This review is for the chocolate Buffett only and not the club!
5
As mentioned in my hotel review Club 55 which is provided ASM part of the club room is excellent and well worth the money. Food and service is fantastic. The views are also fabulous. Once the club room serice is finished (runs between 5pm and 7pm it opens its door for non residents. Well worth trying.
5
good lounge with good view service was good
they specially cook for us indian vegetarian and serve
good in all respect
5
Surprisd at range of canapes on offerreally exciting to try new food. Wehad a view of the city as lights came on, just amazing and staff areexcellent very helpful.
5
Great way to drink in the cocktails and views of Singapore, the Bay and the gardens. The rum punch for two has a kick and the staff were top notch.
5
We had breakfast here most days and evening drinks and canapés on a few occasions and found it great.
There was always a really good range of food options.
The staff were so polite and friendly and the views were absolutely stunning!
4
The cheese was outstanding and there were many chocolate offerings to choose from. However, the price was very expensive and the suggested wine parings were not of the quality expected. We reserved a window table, but when we arrived we were not seated next to the window, even though there was available tables. Very disappointing as the entire reason for going to this restaurant is the view.
5
I am currently staying at Marina Bay Sands with Club Access. Club 55 is really very special. The staff are very attentive and always refer to you by your name. Nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast in the morning is hearty with Asian, Japanese, Sub Continent and Western selections. You always have eggs made to your liking freshly. There is coffee, tea, juice and soft drink available all day. Afternoon Tea is wonderful with savoury and sweet options. Then at night canapÃ©s and two hours of alcohol is the perfect way to end the day. The view is amazing and you can choose bay view or harbour view. Highly recommended!
4
Combination of world best type of cheese and chocolate with scenic view of Singapore for the 55th floor. It is a buffet so can grab as many as can. The water and hot drinks are inclusive. Don't forget to ask for a parking coupon before leaving in case you come with a ca

Went for the Chocolate and Cheese buffet, I don't really like buffets but when you are offered chocolate and cheese one how can you say no?Food was nice, good selection of both cheeses and desserts. Everything looked amazing but was average in taste. The view made up for the food - we were seated with a city view (as requested) wonderful to see the city lights. Do not purchase the wine pairing - wine was low quality and awful, choose a bottle instead. Overall good experienc

Club 55 is located in Marina Bay Sand level 55, with great view over the city. The waiter and waitress there are all very friendly and help us both to take a few great pictures. Our seat is just beside the window with the great city view, restaurant is very romantic and cozy. All guest do not speak loud so the environment is just splendid. The buffet spread consist of 2 sections, the chocolate section and cheese section. The buffet offered a wide varieties and all are freshly made dessert, the bread is warm and the cheese is good. The restaurant suddenly gave us a surprise when lights are suddenly switched off and waitress just came out of the dark with the birthday cake and sing the happy birthday song for my girl friend. Very thoughtfulness and delighted, however for me I am not a dessert person, thus definitely a good restaurant to try out all the dessert, nevertheless would recommend the restaurant to serve other types of dessert instead everything to focus just on chocolate. Tea and coffee is free flow, so a tea with the dessert definitely help to ease all the sweetness, there also serve jack fruit, rock melon and grapefruit. Highly recommended to bring your girl friend or wife there, to enjoy this romantic moment with splendid view
4
We checked out Club 55 right after we got settled in our room. It was OK, though there was nothing much to choose from because they were serving afternoon snacks. I wanted to go back for the cocktails but we got too busy with swimming, and then got hungry and went to dinner. Breakfast at Club 55 was great. Good food selection and much less people dining in. The service was great, too.
5
Great food everything you would want for breakfast hot and cold ,lovely afternoon teas and great canapes.
4
We went on a Saturday night with some friends visiting. You get a good view of the city and 'Gardens by the bay'. Chocolate and Cheese does what it say in the tin.
5
I loved the chocolate brownie! I went there with a colleague that ordered a cheesecake. Good as well.
5
Absolutely superb. We couldn’t fault the service, food or drinks in Club55. The staff couldn’t have done anymore to accommodate my wife’s latex allergy, excellent
5
With the room package we got to access Club 55. It was great. The staff were friendly and very efficient. We visited every day.
5
It is an excellent restaurant on the 55th floor of marina bay sands in Singapore... offers breathtaking views of the entire city this place is a must visit and we were lucky to get a table there in the evening ... good for drinks and desserts this restaurant is really awesome... service was fantastic... reasonably priced ..good food ... excellent views and nicely maintained...that’s all we want ... absolutely nothing to complain... good work guys..

Unable to afford a room we decided to sample Marina bay Sands 5* hotel by visiting Club 55 and the cheese and chocolate bar during our 3 day visit to Singapore and for our anniversary. On arrival at 8am we were greeted and shown to our window table for two with stunning views across the city, then we saw the cheese and chocolate bar and we ecstatic and excited to try it all. As it was our anniversary we decided to try the wine flight and voila $200 gone. Then the excitement stopped as 30 mins later a family with two children (aged 4 and 7)!were placed beside us and the children ran around the restaurant for the next two hours screaming, shouting, climbing under tables (including ours) licking the glass windows and generally disturbing us and the other diners (mainly couples). The parents did nothing despite our looks and looked like did this wherever they went and couldn't have cared less their bad mannered children were ruining other people's evening. We did speak to a waitress to request help when eventually an ipad at full volume was turned on by one of the kids again just behind our seat. the waitress did ask them to turn it down but it went back up straight after the waitress went away and then she never returned to us the rest of our time and at the end the waitress never asked if we'd had a nice time which said it all. We had looked to move but as all the window seats were taken and the view was our main reason for being there we weren't able too and werebjust so upset and frustrated at it being such a ruined night. On asking for the bill I'd assume they would take the drinks off at the very least as it was obvious we were unhappy and stressed from our visit but nothing. The next day I emailed only to receive an email 2 days later saying they would investigate and a full week later and conveniently after we'd left Singapore another email inviting us back! Call that 5* service. I advised them we had left Singapore and they offered reduced room price if we came back! Really are you kidding! I would never ever return and give them 1$ more and shocked they couldnt offer at least some refund. Don't waste your money the emails were truly awful and it really spoilt our visit to Singapore. I attach photos just to prove we were there.. Note these Photos were taken prior to it being ruined by selfish others
5
If there is something you have to experience. Then this is it. A wonderful surprise for my 60th. We had afternoon tea at 3pm until 4pm, then at 5pm until 7pm drinks and canapés and wonderful desserts. I believe their is a chocolate event at 8pm .... we will do this as well next time.
5
We got access to this because we paid for a Club room and it was money well spent. The experience here was faultless from the second we entered for breakfast, afternoon tea or evening drinks and canapés. Service was first rate and the views are sensational. We liked the breakfast offerings and both afternoon tea and the evening drinks were great fun especially with the Champagne we drank. A great experience in Singapor
4
I am a frequent visitor of Club 55. I enjoy the wonderful view & sumptuous food there. The staff there are mostly very polite & helpful. The Head Chef Jim & his team are very nice too. Chef Jim is very pleasant & is receptive to feedback. Because of the good experience, there are many repeat customers. So much so that the crowd has almost quadrupled (I guessed) & very often, there is a long queue of guests waiting for a table. Unfortunately, the food quantity did not increase proportionately to the significant increase in the # of guests.
5
There doesn't seem anything else to say here, it was perfection at breakfast each morning and the afternoon canapes. We were personally greeted and it was something special.
4
We had breakfast twice there.There was a good selection of everything. The view is incredible and they also limit the people that can eat there. Staff were friendly and helpful.
5
Excellent staff. great food, great views. Thoroughly recommend the afternoon tea and evening canapes.
5
Worth every cent. The breakfasts, afternoon tea and especially cocktails are first rate and the views are amazing. Service is superb. Highly recommended
5
Two major points for this club lounge
1. The service is impeccable
2. The priceless view
That is more than enough reason for a good club lounge, and the spread quality is also good
5
Maybe we were lucky, but we had no trouble getting into Club 55 or getting drinks.The views from this place are amazing, no matter which side you decide to sit on.The food and service was also great, with everyone remembering our names (we only stayed for one night).Special thanks to Miles who looked after us so well during cocktails and canapÃ©s and made sure our glasses of champagne never stayed empty. We enjoyed the luxury, even if it was just for one night
4
This Club bar is very crowded both at cocktail hour and breakfast, and you will probably have to wait for a table. View is spectacular at all times, but especially at Sunset. Food is fairly standard fare for Club level, with a good selection of western and Asian dishes. Service is good, considering the number of patrons.
2
Paying extra for Club 55 is not worth it as there are clearly far too many people doing so! Managed to have afternoon tea (which was fine) but then didn't go back after we tried to go for a drink and were told we would have to wait 45 minutes. Understand the laws of supply and demand - but from a behavioural perspective you can make things worse by creating an expectation that you cannot then satisfy - and no-one is more disappointed than someone who is promised a free drink and doesn't get one :-)
5
Club 55 is a must visit in the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The food is great and the views are even better. With your choice of either garden views or city views, both are breathtaking. With breakfast at floor 55 every morning, its the best way to start you day with the infinity pool just 2 floors above you. Staff are very friendly and quick, making sure you are being looked after through your whole visit
5
Champagne is served while we are waiting to be seated during cocktail hours. The food served is tasty though the choices are a bit limited. It would be better if something like fried noodle or rice be served during cocktail hours. Would like to special thanks the lady ( Jesan or Jasen) who served us in the cocktail hours. The club room rate includes the access of lounge for 2 people. Kids is allowed in the club. Kids under 6 can access the lounge for free while older kids are charged for SG 22 ++, 18 ++ and 22 ++ for breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail respectively. Better arrive at the lounge before 5:30 pm for cocktail or you have to wait for a long time as the lounge is already full of people
5
if staying at MBS hotel..go here for breakfast..The staff is very welcoming and warm..the place does end up getting a little crowded..but its nice !!
5
We stayed at the Grand Club room at Marina Bay Sands with access to Club 55. Great afternoon tea, cocktails in the evening and breakfast was fantastic - varied choices with a hot station offering Asian styled breakfast too.
5
There doesn't seem anything else to say here, it was perfection at breakfast each morning and the afternoon canapes. We were personally greeted and it was something special.
5
The food was quite nice, a good selection of nibbles. The evening drinks were great, the staff were exceptional.
5
Food (snacks) here Is amazing - The desserts are so good, free drinks also from 5pm - 7pm - Really worth upgrading to a club room for
4
Service here is solid. Occasional lapses but overall it's good. Food selection is decent and quality is high. Just don't expect the full on breakfast buffet spread. Egg station but no noodle station. hot foods are limited too. it's good enough for a hearty breakfast. no complaints. only peeve is parents letting their kids run wild in the place. the staff don't really do much about it except to play with the kids. staff need to be firm and consider other guests without kids too
1
Club 55 is absolutely the worst club lounge we have ever used in all our travels. The selection of food for afternoon tea and dinner appetisers is so small that it is amost pointless standing in line to get in. Far too many guests with club lounge access for the size of Club 55 We arrived at Club 55 for dinner appetisers at 6pm, and it was completely full, with at least a dozen or more guests and groups waiting to get in After waiting for far too long we gave up and left. Staff are great but paying for a room with Club 55 access is terrible value for money and absolutely the worst financial decision we have ever made
5
This lounge was a nice place to relax with the family. The spread for breakfast and cocktails is decent. However the place is always crowded and that removes any exclusivity from the place. Charges for kids is on the high side.If I had to pay for visiting this place, I would probably skip it. This is included for the club floors and was a decent place to be with the family. The charges for kids - even between 6 to 12 are rather high and not worth it for kids
5
Our family of four (Mum, Dad and kids aged 5 & 8) stayed in a club room at MBS for 1 night in the middle of our 7 night trip to Singapore.We chose a club room in part for the benefits of Club 55, of which we utilised drinks and canapés from 5-7pm and breakfast (6.30-11am).We arrived at Club 55 at about 5.30pm on a Wednesday and were shown to a table facing Gardens by the Bay. We had quite a choice of tables, but chose this side as our room faced the city. The Club was about 20% full when we arrived, and upon leaving an hour a later there were a handful of tables available. I mention this as other reviews I read stated it was quite busy. We didn't feel this at all, and had very attentive personalised service. We all enjoyed a good selection of canapés which became our dinner, a stand out was the pork belly. My husband and I drank beer and champagne respectively, which was refilled readily!We had breakfast on Thursday morning at about 8.30, again nice and quiet in the Club. This time were seated facing the city, after again being offered a choice. Great breakfast selection, the kids loved having donuts amongst the pastries! Huge range of fruit, cold cuts, and American breakfast. I enjoyed waffles with bacon and maple syrup as a treat! The hot drinks were delicious, and we appreciated our waiter's suggestion of a hot chocolate for our daughter which she thoroughly enjoyed.Our room rate catered for two adults, and our son (under 6) ate free, however we needed to pay a small surcharge for our 8 year old. The staff always approached this charge respectfully, however we were well informed of this from booking and check in and were more than happy to pay. We felt that our club room gave great value and would definitely utilise Club 55 again.
5
The breakfast buffet alone makes it worthwhile to upgrade to a club room. They have a variety of western foods and local favorites, something for everyone to enjoy. Get there early as it does get crowded. We arrived shortly after opening and the lounge was full buy the time we left. Go to the pool first, get you pictures before the huge crowds arrive, then stop off for breakfast on you way back to your room
2
Both my partner and I had poisoning from one of the fish canapés served in the afternoon tea seating. The service and other dishes were world class, just very disappointing we both were sick.
5
Wonderful food, wonderful Singapore sling, fantastic service with staff who remember your name and address you by it every time you visit the 55
5
Due to the room we booked at Marina Bay Sands, we had included complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés daily at Club 55. The service was outstanding, food delicious and plentiful with views into next week. We really enjoyed all our meals at club 55.
4
A tasty choice of chocolate desserts and a selection of mouth watering cheeses set in a relaxed atmosphere on the 55th floor of the hotel. We had a table overlooking Gardens by the Bay & got a fantastic view of the super trees light show.
5
Beautiful small restaurant on top of the famous Marina Bay Sands. I can recommend the afternoon tea menu which is really fantastic.
5
We had Club 55 included in our room rate at the Marina Bay Sands.It has amazing Breakfast, High Tea and Evening Cocktails. Service is amazing and the views are so goood that even after our 4 night stay we didnt get tired of it.We chose tables at different corners each day.Overall Food and Drinks are all top of the range. And i was so happy they serve Fiji Water
5
My partner and I went there when we saw their ad at the hotel lobby / mall area and we were not disappointed. Their cheese spread is huge enough but their chocolate spread is magnificent! And the view from 55th floor is breathtaking - we can even see the Supertrees' playful lights from where we were. They also surprised my partner with a birthday cake and singing staff and chef! All this at no extra charge!If you're going, try to reserve for a good view, that one at the very corner. It's worth it
5
It's well worth it if you want to enjoy a beautiful 360 view of Singapore for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening happy hour. The staff will assist you in your orders and the chef does an amazing job on supplying delicious foods for all to enjoy. My best time was the cocktail hour, If you wish, that will turn out to be your dinner. Well worth it
5
We had a suite which included access to Club 55. What I didn't know was that we would be spoilt by the friendly caring staff, and not to mention the behind the scenes chefs preparing all this magnificent food at various times of the day......all included in the room price! And they remember your name each time! How good is that
3
Brought a friend here for her birthday and basically got what I expected. A nice cheese selection and quite a large chocolate spread. However you get what you pay for as at 49$ with such a nice view, this is actually rather cheap. This price point makes itself obvious in the sense that the quality of the chocolate, although pretty, is not that good. Also the cheese selection has a very limited amount of accompaniments so you will pretty much be just eating cheese/bread and chocolate (which is exactly what youre here for). Overall, I was pretty satisfied with what I paid for but I was far from blown away. Service was also rather inattentive and I felt rather slighted when the western couple in front of me got a much nicer reception compared with my somewhat lukewarm greeting
3
Exciting in theory but not that great when you get there. Very overpriced for what it is.
It is scenic and can be a nice outing....
5
It's busy for a club, but the majority of staff remembered and addressed us by name. Food is of high restaurant standards.
5
Club 55 because it is on the 55th floor across the elevator bank from the fitness center.We had the breakfast buffet each of the four days we were in the city. Service is spectacular and the food choices were many, all very good. We also enjoyed the window views of the city. We were hotel guests but it is a huge hotel. How they knew our names to greet us each day was amazingly impressive
4
Book this restaurant as I notice the ambience was good when I was doing my research. Though I didnt get a city view seat, I was escorted to a window seat facing the gardens by the bay I still feel content. The chocolate and cheese spread was just nice. The highlight of my trip here is when they switched off all the light and lighted up a birthday cake to surprise my girlfriend. Thanks to the ladies who serve it while singing the birthday song. My girlfriend had a great time enjoying desserts there and it couldnt be done without your service. Thank you.
2
There is nothing so special food and drinks just ordinary. Only because of location we have to queue up. Wasting time very rude staff I still remember finally after 30 minutes I got chance to go in , who bring me to the table ( Indian lady) very rude. And my table was taking care by one of the Pilipino girl ( kamille) kind enough to get my order for coffee But it was tea unfortunately. Such a nice hotel Doing this kind of service simply spoiling the name .
5
Loving the club room facilities here at MBS. You must get club room if you intend to make full use of the hotel during your stay - I had my 3 meals here, and they were all excellent. Only the afternoon tea fell short of expectations with the spread of scones (too hard), cookies, cakes and fruit. I had expected the same amazing Cheese section they have for breakfast and pre dinner drinks. However, the beautiful view and great service made it all the more enjoyable. They serve great coffee, a good range of teas and juices during afternoon tea. Wait for the pre dinner drinks and canapés from 5-7pm instead of taking too much food at afternoon tea 2-4pm..
5
How to get there:Drop off at Marina Bay Sands Tower 1 or Tower 3. Then walk to Tower 2. There will be 2 lifts at Tower 2 lobby, one which takes you to the 22 floor and the other which takes you to the 55th floor. Take the one to the 55th floor. Once you're out from the lift, you will be able to see the club.What to do / What to expect :Reservations are to be made online so as to not caused any disappointments. Received a complimentary cake for which i requested for my beautiful lady. Special request can be made on your reservation, try to ask for a view facing the city (limited number of seats), try not to get the view facing the gardens by the bay as you can partially still see the construction area for now. The city view is really amazing. Bring along a camera this is good in the dark, as the dining area will be quite dim. Complimentary drinks will be ice water, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Any other drinks will be charged. You do not have to get your own drinks (even the complimentary ones), just order from the table and they will send it over. Buffet will be chocolates, cheese and bread. Tips : Try not to eat before you attend the buffet
5
We had breakfast four times, afternoon tea once and canapés and drinks four times at Club 55 during our 5 night stay at MBS. We were impressed with the quality of food on offer and the vast number of options. Presentation of individual canapé items was of a high end restaurant standard. Choices were different every day and always included a selection of local dishes. We always opted for the Piper Heidsieck, which was topped up at your whim, but there was a selection of wines and spirits also. Staff were always smiley and friendly and made an effort to remember you by name. We were particularly impressed with Sheryl, but were also looked after well by Alvin and others whose names escape me! While it was sometimes busy, we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes for a table, and that wait was softened with a glass of Champagne! There are good views from every table, some facing the city, some the gardens and harbour, and a couple of tables give views in both directions - we enjoyed both
5
Such an amazing view! The staff were very welcoming and accommodating. The breakfast buffet spread was great but the long queue in the morning was a little unnerving. We also went for the afternoon tea and cocktails and I cant even have dinner afterwards because I was stuffed
5
This extra experience may be considered expensive by some people but I personally believe that it is great value for money. The quality of the evening and breakfast offerings far exceeds many of the quality restaurants we have dined at. The food and the service was fabulous, and the staff make you feel special. We will be back to truly enjoy this amazing experience again.
5
The selection at the buffet for both Breakfast and Canapés and Cocktails was varied and plentiful. The canapés were delicious and the Piper-Heidsieck plentiful. Most of all, I was impressed with the staff who were unobtrusively attentive and remembered who we were every visit.
5
I booked online and any my inquiry was answered straight away and we received a city view which was breath taking. Staff are amazing as was the food. We wold recommend this and would even think about taking our teenage boys next time.
5
Staying in a club room had access to Club 55 included and it made the whole stay just so good value. Evening refreshments are offered with so much variety, it literally replaced dinner. Plus drinks included.
5
If you book a large club room at the marina Bay Sands, you are entitled to access club 55. Breakfast, afternoon tea and 5 o'clock snacks and drinks are included. Very attentive staff. The champagne glass is always filled.
4
We went there on january 1st for the Chocolate and Desert Buffet.The buffet has quite a lot of choices, even cheese and bread.It was not crowded ( at $49 SGD so i guess not everyone wants ot pay the price just for dessert).The view of the Singapore skyline is amazing. And itis a very romantic place for a special ocasion
5
We recently stayed here for a romantic getaway and had 2 breakfasts and afternoon teas here. From the moment we arrived and were taken to our table, they remembered our names and that was just the beginning. The food and drinks are top shelf and well worth paying for a club room. Definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Singapore and to stay at Marina Bay Sands!!!!
4
Club55 is amazing for its overlooking view of the city and the Gardens by the Bay!We had a chance to visit Club55 during my birthday as we checked in and availed an Orchid Suite. They gave us passes for 2. They serve breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail hour. Sadly, we only had the time to check out their spread for the afternoon tea.They serve a variety of scones, cookies, bread, muffins, fruits, and chips. As well as free flowing fruit juices, coffee, and tea.It is a self-service spread, but there are always an available staff if you have requests. It was a great afternoon indeed.
5
The cheese is top notch: raclette, verbier, comte, shropshire, yarg and so on, all served at a good temperature and with nice accompaniments.Deserts are all high quality, patissierre and choclatier-made with a nod to some commercial favourites like M&Ms and baci. There's plenty of food choices and the views are stunning. The wine list is limited but reasonable. We had a NV Piper Heidsieck at $112. Soft drinks and tea are a little pricey and service was a bit patchy but overall this was a very pleasant experience
4
We came here with overseas visitors for the Cheese and Chocolate buffet. It's surprisingly affordable and the food was amazing. I think we had 4 servings of the Raclette cheese and uncounted different types of chocolates.And the view is amazing. You can't go past it as a way of wow-ing international guests
5
We had access here since we stayed in a suite at the hotel. During cocktail hours they had free flow of genuine french Champagne! Food was very good compared to other lounges one could have a full dinner here! Even if it was a lot of guests here during our visits, the service was perfect
5
This place has amazing views, attentive, pleasant and courteous staff and great food, What more could you want.
5
The breakfasts with a view are wonderful, massive choice of food, very fresh and the staff are attentive and friendly
4
You get different types of food on a buffet style in this restaurant. But eating with a fantastic view of Singapore is a great way to refill after a busy day!
5
We had breakfast, high tea and snacks at Club 55. It was part of our package at the Sands Marina Bay. Service was beyond outstanding. The variety of food choices, dim sum, congee, bacon, and fruit were outstanding.The mango drinkis terrific.They offered the best breakfasti have ever had
4
Staff remembered what we have ordered and how we liked it from the days before, found this amazing as there were hundreds of people to served daily. Great selection of Asian and Western foods, all fresh and topped up regularly. Complimentary drinks and canapés if requested from 5-7pm daily. Complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea.
5
We had the cheese and chocolate buffet. It was an unforgettable evening with mind blowing views and delectable selection of desserts. The kids had a rocking time gorging themselves on candy. Although by the end of the evening I would have killed for a French fry!!! Would really appreciate it if the establishment would keep that as a refresher for the tongue between the different sweet courses
5
Special night for my daughters birthday. I pre booked this months before our arrival.They were quick to reply and very informative with instructions of how to get to Club55.They even asked if I was celebrating anything special, they would love to know.This place is just wonderful . The staff professional ,friendly and very attentive.Sang Happy Birthday to my daughter and presented her with a cake & candles.The cheese buffet had a great selection of cheeses , crackers ,nuts &spreads.The chocolate buffet had a huge selection of chocolate desserts , chocolates and cake's . Please don't eat before you go. We had the wine package $19 (red ,white & port) which was good value, as wine prices can be quite expensive in Singapore.The views are stunning , we had a table that looked out onto the bay, other tables had views of Gardens by the Bay. It doesn't matter where you sit all views are wonderful.I cannot say enough about this place , I will certainly be returning next time I am in Singapore
5
when I heard about this buffet option I thought it was too good to be true, two of my favourite things... AS A BUFFET. I arrived hungry and worked my way through each and every piece on offer, all were amazing. I also sampled a dessert cocktail (extra charge) which was equally good
4
We love the canapés section during our stayed at the clubroom. The breakfast & and afternoon tea is boring however they have a good view toward the sea and the marina bay. They serve good wines and champagne during the canapés. We wish will return again

We visited for tea and were bowled over by the view. It was a pleasantly bright and sunny day, so we had a 360' view. The spread of sweet snacks sent me into a sugar high. We had lots of fruits and berries with Macaroons, cookies and other baked fare. All sweet! Wonderful service, but some savoury snacks would have made it a more enjoyable experience
4
I landed there taken by a friend, with no expectations. I loved the cheese, and could not stop very easy... then I dived into the chocolate and cookies and they were really good too. The view is super, too.
5
Booked hear for Easter instead of Easter eggs. This place is amazing a huge variety of desserts and cheeses with a fantastic view either over town or over vessels at anchor. The desserts and cheeses are just delicious.
5
We had dinner here for our wedding anniversary and have had a great time. Cheese was very good and so were the sweets. Take the wine and Porto offer, it is worth it!
5
Chocolate is a kind of first love for me and that is a fact but this place changed the way I look at things, in general, and my relationship with cheese and honey, forever!

We visited on a Wednesday night and had booked well in advance. We were surprised to see the bar was nowhere near full. We enjoyed our view and felt that compared to other options, this was the cheapest price for a view. Our chocolate and cheese buffet also included hot chocolate, tea and coffee within the price. We felt the food all looked beautiful. However, taste wise it was all simply acceptable. Still, an enjoyable visit

Cannot fault this dining experience at all, it's an absolute must for those with a sweet tooth!We arrived at 7:20 and were advised that the choc & cheese buffet starts at 8pm so they took our name and booked us a table. (I'd recommend requesting a window table for the fantastic view & there is a laser/light show you can view too at night) When we arrived at 8pm we were shown the chocolate and cheese buffet and offered a complimentary hot chocolate.There was a massive selection of desserts, I saw some previous reviews that said there was limited choice, which surprised me as you could have 3-4 plates worth of food and try something different everytime.Cheese selection was fantastic a great array of cheese types along with crackers nuts and dried fruit.The restaurant itself from the decor to the service was 10/10. Dim lighting created a relaxed environment but also gave it a real indulgent 5* kind of feel to it as well. The staff were so polite and attentive, no request was ignored and drinks were bought out quickly.There was a great wine and cocktail list to choose from but as we were a bit jet lagged we stuck to the hot chocolate. Make sure you pace yourself and don't have a big dinner before hand as you do pay S$49 + tax per person so it'd be a shame to stop at one plate.Yes it is pricey but it is worth it, sitting up on level 55 enjoying the view and eating some delicious food really was a highlight of my stay in Singapore!
4
We started off with the cheese selection trying to line our stomach. They have a good selection of cheeses available but being from New Zealand we are use to having a good variety as well. When moving to the chocolates definately recommend pacing yourself as although they seem really light and some in small portions it is really rich!When you are making your booking I would recommend booking the Sea view if you are already staying in the hotel. The sea view give you a the gardens and they have a light show at certain times which is pretty cool

This was my second visit with a fellow chocoholic. The view alone is worth the price, especially if you are able to get a table next to the floor to ceiling windows facing the Marina Bay. The unlimited servings of TWG tea (limited flavours) is good value considering the venue. My friend liked the complimentary hot chocolate.As this is a chocolate and cheese buffet, the selection of chocolate and chocolate desserts is not that big, but the rich desserts fill you up pretty quickly anyway. There are a couple of non chocolate items like macaroons and fruits as well. Can't comment on the cheese section as I am not a cheese lover but the gourmet bread in that section was pretty tasty.Service was prompt and efficient, if not always the warmest depending on the server.What would make me really happy is if ice-cream were added to the selection. Fingers crossed for my next visit
4
It's on the 55th floor. The views are magnificent. It's a really romantic setting. But it's also great for relaxing conversations and long catch ups. It may be a little expensive for many, but it's an experience worth paying for. The cheese spread was sufficient and delicious. The sweets spread was more than I can sample. I probably only sampled a quarter of the spread before calling it quits. There was an option to have the classic wine or premium wine. All came with a white, red and port. We had the classic Wine selection. Not something I would have gone for with the benefit of hindsight. The port of the only one worth drinking in my opinion. Better off paying by th glass for something you know. It's definitely a haven for chocolate lovers or someone with a sweet tooth.

So much has been written about this experience that it is hard to add anything new! So much praise has been afforded the Cheese and Chocolate Bar/Buffett and it is all warranted. So,e slightly different points to cover than other reviewers ...1. Some of our party had special dietary needs (medically necessary gluten free diet). We advised at the time of booking and special arrangements were put in place in such a way as to maintain the specialness of the night.2. It seems a person with a similar name cancelled their booking but ours was the one deleted. The service recovery was undertaken well.3. At the time of booking we mentioned our visit was for a special occasion. This was duly recognized on the evening.Highly recommend this venue for any visitors to Singapore
4
Chocolate and cheese buffet was absolutely delicious with huge selections of everything you could possibly want or need. Good wine list as well. The restaurant is lovely as well, beautiful interior and lovely views over the gardens or the city.
Definitely a must do!

For lovers and cheese and chocolate you will be in heaven.If you are going to try this buffet, have a late lunch and then go there. There are a range of cheeses, breads, crackers, fresh and dried fruit.Then the chocolate almost anything you wanted was there on offer.The views of course are spectacular, if you can ask for a window seat.It is unbelievabl
5
We came for a visit out of curiosity and we took a cup of tea and even so we were treated with great service by Kodie, it was our last night in Singapore before heading to Malaysia and we wanted to see if it would be worth staying at Marina Bay heading back home to Europe. That cup of tea and that service made us check in there for our last stop. Great view and great service (didnt try the chocolate or the cheese buffet but it looked great!
5
We stayed at MBS in a Club room and had access to the Club restaurant. The food and drinks are excellent, you can have breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés. Breakfast has a good range of food including both western and asian choices. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are very friendly and welcoming, making one feel at home. The level of service is of the highest quality
5
This was a really fun evening for our family - the kids flipped out over the chocolate bar. We've never seen anything like it. Pictures are so much better than words in this case.The cheese bar was just as impressive.Breathtaking view, Soft and hot drinks included in the price (add 10% service charge + 7% tax to the initial S$40+). Expensive but worth it for a one time experience.Wish they had some veggies or salad to go with the cheese, though. Cheese and Chocolate are such heavy foods, you really can't eat too much, which is good but also kind of frustrating with all the variety
5
We went to the Chocolate Bar on Christmas Eve for dessert with a view. Of course, it was much more than that. Located on the 55th floor of Marina Bay Sands, the view of the city and the bay is gorgeous. And the choices of chocolate desserts are more than four of us, combined, could sample, although we tried! There are desserts other than chocolate, as well. And we all loved the selection of cheeses to choose from, also. It was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend it.
5
The view over Singapore is amazing from the chocolate bar. We chose to go there with our kids, since a full dinner at a restaurant like c'est la vie is always quite an adventure with them ;) At the chocolate bar, we could enjoy the magnificent view, had great cheese and deserts and also time the visit, so it was appropriate for everybody. We reserved, but on a weekday it was not so full that a reservation had been necessary.

I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Cheese and Chocolate at Marina Bay Sands. It really is a very pleasant place to dine, with stunning (and I really mean stunning!) views of the CBD, Marina Bay and the Straits. Food:The food is fantastic; there is a large range of cheese and condiments to choose from all of which are very good quality and I enjoyed every bite. The range of chocolate has to be seen to be believed. I was in heaven. The sheer range of different chocolate options is staggering; I don't think I've seen so many different types of chocolate in one place before. There's fresh fruit available too if you're boring, but if all you're after is fruit you probably shouldn't be going to this place.Drink:Wines are available and there is a good selection that range from good quality, reasonably priced wines to much more expensive options depending on what you are going for. Soft drinks and coffee, tea, etc are all part of the buffet price.Service:Singapore has a reputation for having slightly shoddy service, however the service here at Cheese and Chocolate was exemplary and exactly what you'd expect from such a venue. The waitress was very attentive (but not overly so!) and we felt welcome and looked after during our stay. It is one of the best places I've been for service in Singapore. Staff are friendly and polite; I couldn't ask for more.View:Seriously, wow. Stunning views all round from the 55th floor. I don't think I could really do it justice by writing about it here. Go see for yourselves
5
This is expensive but well worth it. Some of the best and most varied chocolate I have tried anywhere in the world. They truly do wonders with the bean.
5
Awesome spread of chocolate, alot that I havent tasted before. Best to come at sunset to enjoy views. Never expected it to be so filling but very worth it. Can choose to pair it with champagne too.
5
You get to indulge in a over-the-top chocolate buffet while enjoying a magnificent view of the city. A great experience to share with a group of friends or family for a special occasion.
4
I don't know why some reviewers say it's expensive. For S$48 you get a great selection of mainly french cheeses, nice breads and lots of interesting dessert choices, tea, coffee or hot chocolate and a great view from the 55th floor of MBS. If you want wine to accompany your cheese, a large glass of a decent Aussie red is S$15! It's as if you've skipped the starters and main courses at The Fullerton Sunday BrunchThe waitresses were excellent and attentive, the buffet choice was always kept tidy and plentiful. There's no rush, just take your time and enjoy the food and the view. What is there to dislike, unless you don't care for cheese or chocolate

Perched high atop level 55, I was blown away by the stunning and sensational view overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the city lights of Singapore. The entire club lounge was flanked by floor to ceiling glass, allowing diners a fantastic view of the sights of our beautiful city! For starters, the wide cheese selection was spread along a table filled with assorted biscuits, crackers, jam and bread to pair along with. Cheese range from hard to soft, earthy to creamy. We had the cheese straight up and even went along pairing with the lavender honey coupled with some nuts. There were three types of bread available, of which the french loaf was toasted to such crisp the neighbours could have heard us munching away. The chocolate desserts comprised of cakes, mousse, tarts and so on. You could taste varying degrees of texture be it hard and nutty or smooth and velvety. The white chocolate passionfruit cake stood out as one that was both sweet and refreshing in each bite. I also loved the orange creme brûlée that contrasted the tangy flavours of citrus with chocolate. I was amazed to find one of the shooters with blue cheese foam and milk chocolate mousse, said unique creation! The entire experience was phenomenal. It was a quiet night with a wonderful view of the night sky

Went to chocolate bar at marina bay sands on 8/12/15 and had a great time , food was delicious and a great selection, we optedFor the wine to accompany the cheeses et and was well worth the money ... The restaurant was pretty quiet which is maybe why it seemed to lack a little atmosphere but service great and views out of this world . If you like chocolate and heights you will LOVE this place .
5
What a fantastic experience! One that will be remembered for a long time! Not just does this place have the most amazing view in the city, the range of chocolate and cheese is mesmerizing. Its made to perfection and wish that I could eat more! Fantastic, must visit place

Came here for our anniversary and we couldn't be any more decadent. We made reservations and since we were using the UOB card to pay for, we each got complimentary champagne.The selections were abundant and would appeal more to extreme chocolate lovers - there were milk choc, white choc, dark choc that came in a variety of beautiful packages!I did find a crack on my champagne glass when I was halfway through (closer inspection after being all full from the chocs) and informed the waiter. He immediately apologised and took it away only to return with a full glass of champagne. Oh my delight!We did witness them dimming the lights and playing the birthday song for one of the other couple and presented them with a cake. We ourselves got a slice as it was our Anniversary. We were very much delighted!The night was dreamy and beautiful (all the endorphins from chocs pretty much turned our moods into those slow dreamy romantic feel ala movies), we ended it with a stroll through the skypark (entitled to it when you dine at the bar/restaurants located within the skypark).It was a great night of pure decadence
5
Attentive service from the waiting staff, delicious gigantic indulgent, though pricey cocktails. Subtle, intimate lighting and fantastic views. All adds up to a very special treat. We treated ourselves to it on our last night staying at Marina Bay Sands. Our table was booked for 8pm. We arrived promptly and were met by very attentive and friendly staff. Always using your name for that personal touch. We were surprised that despite the restaurant being empty, we were shown to a table for two in the very narrow section of the restaurant at the back, overlooking the gardens. You sort of feel a little hidden away and almost like you are not really there. Only a couple of other people who arrived after us were placed in the same area, which felt like a through corridor with tables and nice lighting, but definitely feeling like an after thought or an annexe to the true restaurant. We were still served excellently by very professional staff. The cheese buffet is not as extensive as you might like, but most people come for the chocolate of which there is an abundance. The breads are very good, especially the cranberry bread. There was also complimentary tea and coffee making facilities if you wish to forgo the alcoholic options. The chocolate buffet is a mouth watering delight. Firstly you need to photograph everything and then you need to taste everything, which is no easy feat. The staff will encourage you to go back and try more, even telling you their own favourites. The only thing I didn't like was the hot banana pudding. The whole thing was amazing. I would pay airfare back to Singapore for that and Raffles afternoon tea. Both being a very luxurious treat. If you would prefer a table with city view, I would mention this when you book, else you might be seated in the back. Nothing wrong with the garden view, but the city view at night is something else. Even when we left there were plenty of tables in that section, so we felt a little puzzled why we were not afforded the opportunity to be seated there. This does not detract from the amazing food and service we received. Definitely recommended
5
If you love cheese or chocolate then you will love this place. Very romantic with a beautiful view of Singapore's skyline.Excellent selection of cheese with bread and many types of chocolate - actually, I expected less of the m&ms and milky ways but i suppose kids like that. Cheese and chocolate souffle and chocolate fondue were the highlights for me.The wine tasting option was a bit of a joke - two half glasses of wine and a tiny port - charge an extra $10 and fill the glasses! Eat a big lunch and skip dinner so you have plenty of room
5
Great coffee early in the morning with friendly helpful staff.
They do an absolutely amazing chocolate éclair that can substitute really well for an evening snack.
5
We visited this bar because it was big dream of our children,it was really very nice there! Very helpfull and professional staff,wide variety of chocolate and cheese possibilities,nice view,high recommended!
5
The most amazing experience ever! What a BEAUTIFUL location situated at the top of MBS over looking the amazing lights of Singapore :) I took my partner here for a surprise for his birthday. We arrived and were greeted by a lovely lady at the desk. As we were slightly early, we were seated for only 10 minutes in the lounge area before being taken to our table in the restaurant part. We had a magnificent window table which was amazing! As for the spread of food.... WOW! This was incredible! We both made ourselves very full but it was worth it! The tea and coffee was also all you can drink so this was great too! All the lights went off and staff then brought over a piece of cake and sang happy birthday to my partner which was very special :) The staff, the food and the location all faultless and it certainly was the most incredible experience for us both. Thank you so much for such a perfect evening.

After a late lunch we went here in the evening. s$ 48 a head but well worth it!Jax worked her way through the staggering array of chocolate delights with the skill of a long distance runner!Staff were very friendly and helpful. Personally not a chocolate lover so was a looking forward to the cheese selection. Had read there were 30 on offer so a little disappointed to "only" find 15! No biggy.......went round twice!Great experience with great views from the 55th.Awoke the next day with a slightly thick head.........Jax (as only a wife can) gently reminded me it was probably the bottle of Port we drank.........well it did go so nicely with the choc and cheese!Will go bac
5
Super love the atmosphere and the quality of the desserts served at The Cheese and Chocolate Bar. The food is of good quality, nicely crafted and super yummy. Dining with a great view just topped the experience. Service is super good as well and overall is wonderful experience. Price is slighlty steep in view of the selections but they are definitely worth it for special occasions. Tips: Request for window table with city view
4
Another food feast where we left in pain from too much wonderful food! We chose to pair with the dessert wines and certainly dented the extraordinarily large choice of cheese and chocolate. Don't go just for dessert, this is a full meal in itself. The chocolate soufflé was worth the wait, and the cheese choices to die for. The service was a bit blasé and we didn't get much of an explanation as the tables of young women took most of the waiters attention
5
Situated in Tower 2 on the 55 floor, it is for hotel guests only. If you stay in a club room it is included. Breakfast is from 7 to 11 AM. A large variety of food and drinks by choice, excellent quality of ingrediences. Tea is from 2 to 4 PM and drinks from 5 to 7 PM. Very kind and helpful staff
5
I am not a big chocolate fan but as my companion wished to try this for dessert after a dinner elsewhere, I was happy to go along and I am glad I did. We got a great seat overlooking the 'Gardens By the Bay' just in time for its light show, which set the tone. What can I say about a chocolate and cheese buffet? It was all good and there was plenty to choose from. If I lived in Singapore, I would definitely return there for a special celebration but outside of this it is a little expensive for the average person’s regular dessert outing. The service was first glass, as expected, but there was also a genuine warmth about our main waiter, which added to our positive experience. Before we left we took the lift to the 59 floor to view the city from the open terrace, very impressive. If we had known that the Gardens were still open that late, we would have taken a wander around them, as we didn’t get a chance during the day. 
5
Very expensive but oh so decadent.it's one of those things you just do on vacation.dark chocolate lovers will be in heaven.the only thing I thought was weak was the hot chocolate drink.it tasted like a watered down mix.the cheesecake has now ruined me for life as no one else will ever be able to reach that pinnacle of taste.I'm still having nightly dreams about it.my daughter loved the wines.neither of us are much of the cheese sine the chocolate and cheesecake kept calling
5
We got here a little early for our 20:30 reservation but that was fine. We were shown straight to our window seat. The wines were a little expensive so we ordered soft drinks (well of course I didn't as tiger beer was on the list). I had several goes at the excellent cheese buffet with crackers, bread and jams. I almost didn't leave room for the chocolate buffet but did manage to squeeze a few down,The food was good and the atmosphere relaxed but it's the views that really make a visit here worthwhile.Other reviewers have commented on not being asked if they wanted more drinks or complained they couldn't get a chocolate soufflé. My experience was that staff were very attentive and promptly cleared away used plates; and they were easily summoned for more drinks. Soufflés were cooked to order so no problems there either. Highly recommended
3
It was not worth the 48++ per person because i have seen much petter in other places, however the service, view and kindness of the staff is undeniable.
5
I love eating chocolates and I got to admit this is one of the best places that I adore. They have a lot of range of food esp. desserts which one can have a craving for instantly.
5
I much preferred the choice of cheese than the chocolate, as the latter was more about a choice of desserts than it was chocolate. Try the famous tea. It's great fun but expensive.
4
My family and I have a chocolate and cheese buffet for celebration of my sister birthday. But when we heard a birthday song from the staff, I found there is at least 4 celebrate the birthday ^^.For the view, there is 55 floor of Sand, the perfect view to see the Garden by the Bay at night.For the chocolate, actually, no special...., may be I can get a cake any else in other cake shop that better than here. But come with the free flow coffee, tea, chocolate mike, the wonderful view of Garden by the bay, all the nice staff here with birthday song, it is worth to have the chocolate and cheese buffet here.Please change the address, the bar in 55 floor, not 5
5
Went there with my Girlfriend just to try out all the chocolate in this place. It was like chocolate heaven. They had a great wine pair and an amazing collection of wines as well to match with the stuff. Staff was great but did not get the table i reserved for, but nevertheless it was an amazing place filled with chocolate
5
The Cheese and Chocolate Bar was a wonderful way to spend our last night In Singapore. I don't think I'd ever get to visit the Exec Lounge of MBS at any other time and the view alone is worth it! Great variety of cheeses plus breads, crackers etc. Oh, and of course the chocolate...cheesecakes, tortes, mousses, brulees, macarons, even a bowl of good ol' M&Ms. Hint - do not eat dinner beforehand. This IS dinner
3
The night-time view from 55 stories provided a truly romantic backdrop for an intimate occasion. The setting was private, quiet and opulent.The wide range of cheeses was not adequately supported by the range of condiments on offer in my opinion.The chocolate bar was very visually appealing however after careful scrutiny I struggled to find very much that tempted my taste buds. I tried twice to get a soufflÃ© from the buffet. Both times there none available and I was very disappointed that the chef did not offer to arrange for someone to bring one to my table when the next batch were ready, on either occasion. Very poor service I thought. We elected to have both of the Optional Wine Pairings: Classic (3 glasses of Classic wines for $19++) & Dessert (3 glasses of Dessert wines for $28++). The classic in my view offered more pleasing wines. Our drink waiter was very attentive throughout
5
The view of Singapore from the 55th floor of MBS is spectacular, but still surpassed by the five star service of the courteous and knowledgeable hostesses.There are cheese and chocolate buffets. The cheese buffet also contains dried fruits, and a wide selection of biscuits and bread. The cheese is refined and the chocolate is delectable. We accompanied these with Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile, a Portugese port, and Ivory coffee ground in front of our eyes from beans that were excavated from the digestive system of a Thai elephant.Definitely a 'must return
5
Husbands had a business conference, so on a day we'd a a big lunch, a group of us women did this at 8pm. Thought the cheese bar was very nice, great variety, my favorite part, as I enjoy savory more than sweet. Limited but nice wine choices by the glass, or a flight of their choosing. The chocolate bar was also very nice, the souffle was the BEST! Great view (55th floor) and very fun treat
4
As you would expect. Large variety of cheeses and chocolates. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan so I mainly stuck with the cheeses but if you are going for the chocolates you won't be disappointed. Service was good, they never once made me feel guilty for going up so many times. I guess my only criticism would be is they didn't have enough fruit or preserves for the cheese. And there was no allergy advice / notice for any of the products. But I would hope that if you had asked someone would have been able to assist.
5
The design and atmosphere was superb just as the taste and quality of the chocolate. We parents and all our kids liked it very much. Just drop by if you have a chance.
4
lots of choice and good value for money. We got full quickly, perhaps miss dinner this night! Not just chocolate but different cakes, cookies, fruit, cheese, breads, jams, hot drinks. A lovely atmosphere and recommended sitting overlooking the gardens all lit up.
5
What a brilliant idea! Cheese and chocolate! Huge selection of delicious desserts, and wonderful cheeses. Great view and helpful staff. This was our second visit and I would definitely go again
3
I had been looking forward to our chocolate buffet for weeks and weeks, but feel it didn't really meet my expectations unfortunately.When we arrived we where sat around the corner, I asked for a window table but was advised they where already reserved / booked.The chocolate buffet has a good variety of items. Most of them where good, a couple items we where not so keen on, but overall tasty. I found the cheese buffet ok - but not amazing. Would be nice to get some butter to go with the cheese and crackers.What really let it down for me was the service. We where sat right next to a waiter till / service area - which was a little disruptive. The service was very slow, we where served drinks but then no one came back over to us, no one asked us if everything was ok, or would we like another drink / tea. The staff look uninterested in serving us and instead more interested in talking to each other. From such a high quality hotel and restaurant I really expected great service, and I was let down. If I return to Singapore I would not return to the Chocolate Bar.Note - you have a great view from the Chocolate Bar but because of the reflection from the windows and lights its hard to get a good photo, there is no outside area
5
This is located on the top floor of Marina Bay Sands just below the floor with the infinity pool. The view is to die for. The chocolate can actually kill you if you have too much. We had so much chocolate that we needed something salty to neutralize our palate. Must visit if you love chocolate
4
Overall it's a fantastic place to be. The view was breath taking, and the staffs were great! Made a reservation the day before and told it was a birthday treat. (I was asked, more of that later.) the chocolate and cheese section was not bad could be better if there was an chocolate fountain. I mean Westin has it at their dessert section at seasonal taste. So mbs can improve on that. Half way through the buffet the stuff dimmed the light and present a slice of cake. (The other table had few staff sang a song for them, not that I'm complaining my sweetheart didn't had a song. But it's a nice touch. Kudos to the staff!!) One of the staff an old Chinese lady was very friendly and had a chat with us telling us the difference between the cheese and wish us a great night As well. The view of the Singapore central business district was worth the price alone. Do visit if u love chocolate and cheese!
5
The Club is divine...a cheese lovers delight.. comliment it with the taster of 3 glasses of wine..white/red/ortIf you can get through the cheese and still have room left..then indulge your taste buds at the chocolate buffet.....I have been here 3 times now and it never fails to imress the taste buds.

The Chocolate Bar is an awesome place for an evening out with friends to indulge in treats you'd normally not partake in on a daily basis. Certainly good for special occasions and such.Living up to its name, the selection of chocolates and desserts with chocolate as its highlight is extensive, and is really rather good. I especially loved the freshly made doughnuts and the immensely rich, made-to-order hot chocolate.If you're a big cheese fan, you may be a tad disappointed with the much smaller selection of cheeses on offer - most of them being pretty generic. The usual suspects - blue cheese, sheeps' cheese, aged cheddar, brie/camembert, comte/gruyere are all present and accounted for and aren't at all bad, but the selection simply pales in comparison to the range and variety of chocolates on offer. If there's one thing that I wish for would be a more extensive and "interesting" cheese selection.Nonetheless, this place fantastic views, lovely ambiance and more than enough sweet treats to make up for its cheesy shortcomings
5
Everything about this experience was fantastic!From our table next to the window, with the amazing view looking out over Marina Bay from the 55th floor. To the excellent service we received from all staff, including the wait staff and also the staff manning the food stations. Before we got there, my plan was to try EVERY cheese option first, then try ALL of the chocolate choices, and then go back for more of all my favourite cheese and chocolate options. Only problem was there were sooo many options at each station, I couldn't possibly try them all before I was too full. The variety was amazing!We also tried the wine flutes, which were delicious. A fantastic all around experience :
5
We were referred by our relative and therefore decided that we should go to the Club since my husband and I both love cheese as well as chocolate. We had high expectations and we were not at all disappointed. The buffet layout was incredible. They had very good collection of cheese and the chocolate desserts were completely sinful. We had a great time at the restaurant. This experience will remain in our heart forever. Not to forget, the view of Singapore that we got from the restaurant was adding another level to the experience. This place is highly recommended

This is a little treat we always do when travelling to Singapore. We enjoy the phenomenal views at the top of Marina Bay Sands while relaxing and enjoying delicious chocolate desserts and imported cheeses. Highly recommend as a guilty indulgence

I love chocolates and needless to say, the name itself was very evry beguiling for me and I found sometime during my busy schedule to visit the chocolate bar
4
I would call this a quaint little place specializing in, well, you guessed it, CHOCOLATE! A huge selection of chocolate infused drinks and desserts. Menu options were varied with complex structures of tasty treats. My wife and I both enjoyed our meals and a very elegantly presented and tasty dessert. Service staff was quite friendly and made recommendations. About $25 per person with soft drinks, dinner, and a dessert to share

I was taken there as a Valentine's Day surprise and all I can say was wow. The display was beautiful and the scenic views of the city was amazing. It was definitely worth the cost considering the location and views. While I am not a big chocolate fan, the buffet was great. They have a great selection of deserts and cheeses but just a small choice of bread. This is a really great place for an occasion. It was definitely the place I would have wanted to be on Valentine's Day during my visit to Singapore!!

Best to book in advance, but recently you can just walk in and register in the Marina Bay Sands hotel lobby tower 1.The place has outdoors seating facing Gardens by the bay and indoors seating right next to the infinity pool -- best way to enjoy the Singapore skyline :)and only 48 SGD including all you can eat chocolate and cheese
5
The buffet spread is awesome. Every single dessert at the bar tastes just nice. And the no. of crowd is perfect (not crowded). The management really control the number of dine in guest to maintain the atmosphere. I really applaud them for this. ♡Just make early reservations online to avoid disappointment.

I must say that I was an impressed of this restaurant.Their cheese selections are only from France, so not much to sa and as for their chocolate desserts they have no imagination at all...I don't think that Snickers and Milky Way chocolate bars should be found on any restaurant menu... Their wine selection is close to zero... as they give you 3 low towards average value wines for the wine pairing without having any other options, but their price is reasonable $19++... At least make it 30++ and let the customer have a choice?!?! don't you agree ?Only cheese and 3 types of bread you can find there... don't expect anything else and as dessert the same chocolate options you can find anywhere else.I can only recommend this place for their view and very good service
5
my partner and I wanted to spoil ourselves after watching Mama Mia the musical. We were ushered into the 57th floor... breathtaking views awaited us!!! the staff were fantastic and the food amazing. Chocolate and Cheese -what a combination, with a great selection of cheese such as Shropshire, Fourme D'Ambert and Blue d Auvergne to cater for everyone's need. Chocolate dipped strawberries, strawberry basil ,lollipop, chocolate brioche, macarons and the humble nutella to name a few. When in Singapore and have the craving for something different - one must try The Chocolate Clu
4
Chocolate and Cheese are my 2 favourite foods so I was happy! They had a great selection and I enjoyed the wines also. Friends recommended we come here during our stay in Singapore as you can access the famous Marina Bay Sands pool! Definitely take your swimmers and enjoy the pool after your meal! The restaurant is located in the middle of the sky deck and we enjoyed the view after our meal. You can't get up there without a reservation to the restaurant or if your staying at the hotel
5
All I can say is Wow!
Fantastic chocoholics delight.
Great cheese selection with wonderful soft breads.
Ate so much it was like willy wonkas wonderland.
Views amazing.
5
You will get the best service here, a great variation of cheese and chocolate and the best view of Singapore! 60S$ per person is more than worth it for this great experience and feeling! I would it again any time!
5
It's a wonderland for chocolate lovers — excellent selection of desserts! And of course, the cheese spread. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here — definitely recommend.

I made a reservation by Internet to celebrate my spouse's birthday - it was easy peasy. indicated that we were celebrating a birthday and email/sms confirmation were sent. there was no free parking, the hostess at Rise restaurant couldn't (or wouldn't) let us go up half an hour earlier. But when we went up, the view was breathtaking and we understood what the fuss was all about. All the staff were attentive, the food was yummy - cheese & choc, what could be better than that. we ordered 3 flute of wine for $19. free flow of tea and chocolate drink. we had a complimentary slice of cake with a birthday song. there was a 10% off the buffet with citibank card. we heard they might be shifting 2 floors below so we were glad we came (pay for buffet and get free view). will I visit again? only if it comes with the view
3
Firstly, my review might be a little inflated because I didn't pay for my experience there. I was invited by a friend for her birthday party there but if I had to spend on that, this review wouldn't be as positive as it is now.So when I entered the building, I was ushered to this booth type thingy where they gave me my card in order to access the skypark. Maybe I was using it incorrectly, but that card was made of paper and I'm sure I looked like a complete idiot tapping it in the lift so that the lift could let me pick a floor HAHA. Luckily, another hotel guest was going to the skypark too so I managed to hop along with her. Now the view is fantabulous. The infinity pool is breathtaking and it's really windy so overall, a very nice atmosphere! Then I entered the restaurant and saw a very impressive display of chocolate desserts and cheese platters artfully strewn about. Couldn't wait to dig in! This was my very first experience at a chocolate bar and evidently I'm no chocolate connoisseur so I expected myself to be blown away with this delicate and beautiful desserts made with the finest chocolates in all the land. Unfortunately, none of them really amazed me except for the strawberry-basil pop tarts, those were reaally interesting!! Some tasted downright awful like this pear thingy, tasted rotten. But most of the desserts had a pretty average chocolatey taste, maybe I was just expecting too much. I did like the cheese selection though! It nicely washes your mouth clean off all the chocolate so you're ready to dive into more desserts!Overall, I'm glad I went but I don't think I'd go again if I had to pay for this.

Sorry, I cannot give you a review of the choc bar.But I have now booked this place twice, over a 2 year period and visited the skydeck and pool with my friends / family.We tried to buy tickets to do the tour of the pool/sky deck but they were sold out.So we "booked" to dine at the Choc restaurant, which is located right near the amazing infinity pool. We checked in downstairs and they ushered us up to the top floor and pointed us in the direction of the restaurant. But instead of dining we checked out the pool area / the sky deck viewing area and then took the lift back down. Too easy. Sorry to have missed the restaurant book. I felt bad for a bit until I remembered the price of the chocolate degust'.They only take booking in the evening, but time it for the lazer show.It was great and free and it worked for me twice!I am only now mentioning this on TripAdvisor because I won;t need to do it again.Give it a go!! :

Dined here in October as a special treat for myself and some friends on a 2 day stopover in Singapore. Service was excellent, but it was not worth the price. The chocolate was very rich and the cheese selection not particularly inspiring. My friends and I ate very little as we felt quite unwell very quickly. We were particularly annoyed when it came time to pay the bill. The MBS website states the cost is $49pp, however we were also slugged an extra 10% service fee and 7% GST. By no means worth $66 per person for this experience
5
Went to The Cheese and Chocolate Bar after our dinner at Ku De Ta. The service was excellent. We were greeted by the staff and we were allowed to choose our preferred seats. After that, the staff will guide us to the buffet area where he will explain what is there. Milk chocolate, dark choco, cheese sections etc. Wide variety of chocolates and cheese. We ate until we can't walk! One of the staff, the waiter name Vincent was very helpful. We requested to changed our table, because we wanted a better lighting to take our photos. He helped us to change our table and even offered to help us take a few photos. From my observations, the staffs treat their guests very well. Even converse with them and ask about the food etc. which is good in terms of customer service. How I wish there was a fondue fountain at our table. and I wish there were more variety of fruits such as banana, apple and plain marshmallows for the chocolate fondue. Or even, it would be better if theres a cheese fondue like those in Switzerland!Overall, i'm satisfied! Kudo

The night was perfect. The indulgence of chocolate, cheese, wine and port whilst sat outside on the 57th top floor of the marina bay sands hotel looking out over the wonderful Singapore was simply outstanding. This was the finest collection of chocolate and cheese I have ever seen. The flavours were wonderful. And the additional of very elegant wines and ports for SG$19 was nearly the icing on the cake. However, that was left to the special surprise wedding anniversary cake the restaurant had gone out of its way to prepare for us. A special touch. Overall the service was the best we had in Singapore. Especially attentive. Next time in Singapore we will absolutely indulge again. Top off with cocktails in Ku De Ta. A great memory. If in doubt, don't be just go. You will be in wonderland for an evening
3
The location is great, up to the Marina Bay Sands. But, the quality of food is not as great as we expected in this type of restaurant. Cheeses, chocolates, cakes, wines are like we can find in supermarkets in Europe. Only breads are very good quality. The service is good and efficient
5
I very much recommend this restaurant. its fun to have an evening of indulging in chocolate, and when your done you can sneak out for some fantastic views of Singapore. Fairly expensive, but for the whole package (food, experience, cocktails, view) id definitely recommend.
3
We went here after dinner with a group of six. I thought the chocolates were generally lovely to look at but not very interesting to taste. Lots of highly decorated, but bland cakes. the cheeses were somewhat better. This is a very expensive (about $65SGD) which is about $50 USD. Service was so-so.I think you should give this a pass
5
Well, if you want to go to 57th floor of Marina Bay Hotel, enjoy great view and observe hotel guests in the infinity pool there, this is the only way. Great chocolate comes on top. There is a fixed price with like (almost) all inclusive. You can walk along the terrace or sit in in the restaurant and just enjoy. The view at night is the best and the only watchout is the rain as the area is only partially covered. The chocolate selection is very impressive, from white to dark, with nuts, fruits, cookies - you name it ! At the end, it is difficult to decide if the view is better or the it is the chocolate...Enjoy :-
4
Its at Marina Bay Sands Tower 1, Level 57. The speciality is that they serve 57 chocolate dishes in buffet style. Brownies, chocolate bread loaf with chocolate infused spreads, White choc nougat, macadamia cookies, dark choc coookies, peanut and pecan cookies, 72% grand cru araguani chocolates with orange and dark chocolate coated hazelnuts and white chocolate coated pistachios, chocolate profiteroles, cheesecake lollipop, mint and dark choc with light cream, strawberry panna cotta, black pepper pineapple with white chocolate were really unique in the buffet spread. Of course, the usual chocolate fondue with fruits, pastries, cakes, mousses were available too! Its beside the infinity pool and offers both city (front balcony) and the sea view (back balcony). Its open from 8pm till midnight, everyday. Reservation is highly recommended as you'll be given an exclusive/free access to the roof-top (thats where the restaurant is located). Pay $20 per pax if you choose to walk-in. The ambience is kinda posh yet romantic with candle lit table. Service is above par. Waiters and waitresses are quite friendly. They clear your plates and fold your table napkins promptly and use dect phones with ear-piece to communicate with each other. cool isn't it? As for the desserts, i'd say, chocolate indulgence at it's best!
5
I had wanted to go there for quite some time but was waiting for the right occasion. That occasion finally came, and I was not disappointed.First, the setting itself is stunning. The views from the top of Marina Bay Sands are breathtaking, especially at night. To get to the restaurant, you walk past the Infinity Pool and get an amazing view of the city.But the real star of the show is the food. The variety of cheese is impressive (and something that is hard to find in Singapore), and the chocolate desserts are delicious. Think 20+ high-quality desserts, made with top ingredients, in perfect small portions. If you are a chocolate lover, you'll leave this place rolling. We also took the classic wine flight, which nicely complemented the cheese and some of the desserts.Yes, it's a bit expensive but all things considered (and given that this is Singapore, after all) it's well worth it. The kind of place that you should go to once
3
It's a nice enough idea and setting, and I am glad we went. But unsure I'd go again. As long as you go there to have a nice experience, see a few nice views off the pool deck, and don't put too much emphasis on the food, then I think you'll be OK.Price was appropriate, given the location and hotel. The cheeses were good, although they could have diversified with some more options. Felt like too many of the same thing. More accompaniments too, as it got old shoveling cheese and bread. The chocolate options were terrific, and a nice touch with the chef preparing ice cream designs.The staff was very attentive and polite, so another plus. Although, I discourage you from sitting in the back patio, as the waiters from the adjoining restaurant used our area to walk back and forth to the kitchen ... even taking carts with big garbage pails back and forth ... which is hardly appropriate thing to do in the middle of your official restaurant. Really distracted us to have so many waiters pacing back and forth all night, making so much noise, and almost ruined the evening. I recommend the three tables in that pathway be removed from circulation
5
This buffet was a real highlight of our trip. We did not stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - but this is at the top next to the infinity pool so the views were outstanding. The chocolate and cheese were excellent and we ended up completely full of really yummy dessert. A must do
5
Amazing experience!The service is very good, polite staff and the buffet is great. So much choice and its not sickly chocolate that you can get too- its of a good quality and there is a lot of variety! Its right by the infinity pool aswell! We didnt stay at the hotel so this allowed us to actually see the pool and admire the scenery. I couldve actaully gone for a swim aswell and they wouldnt have noticed. (The alternative if you are not a hotel guest is to pay a load of money to go to the observation deck to one side where you dont get to the pool and frankly isnt so good)I would recommend both for the view and the food
5
Eating at the chocolate buffet was a great experience for chocolate-and-cheese lovers such as myself and my two friends. The buffet consists of 25+ different chocolates, including a few fruits, and a cheese buffet with bread. Tea, hot chocolate and water is included in the buffet, but you have to order it from the waiter. The combination of chocolate, fruit, tea and cheese gave the buffet a nice balance.We followed the advice of other reviewers and booked a table outside in advance. We didn't regret it. The view is magnificent and worth the relatively pricey buffet. Eating at the Chocolate Bar also gives you access to _view_ the Infinity Pool, though actually taking a dip in it is reserved for the guests of the hotel. Dress code is smart casual, meaning no shorts or t-shirts and more along the lines of long pants and shirts or dresses. It can get a bit windy outside so don't wear a fancy hat that will dissappear into the sunset

We went one evening in Febraury at 8:30pm so we could watch the Supertree light show.On balance I've given this place an average. The good:- great views and an opportunity to get to the top of Marina Bay Sands without paying for a room.- a good selection of cheese and chocolate, I did not count but I would think at least ten cheeses and over twenty different chocolate items.- staff were friendly and attentive- good views of the sound and light show, although the sound did not carry all that well.The not so good:- the wine pairing advertised was not really paired at all. I had expected recommendations if what cheese and wine to eat and drink together but received nothing of the sort.- the desserts are not as exciting as I had hoped, the items were nice, but nothing blew me away.- the price was quite high and while I enjoyed it, I am not convinced it was worth SGD $100 each (approx).It might be obvious it some but it's windy up there. I did not tie my hair back and as we were outside I should have
5
It's the place I always go with my friends when I travel to Singapore. Going to a chocolate buffet as a woman might be dangerous but I just love the food in combination with the view. A really great place to be with friends :)
4
I was very impressed with number of items and presentation of buffet, everything I tasted was lovely! You certainly won't go hungry, it was nice to have some fruit and chutneys included with the cheese too. We did the wine pairing and given cost drinks in Singapore it didn't seem a bad price, €19singapore for 2 glasses wine and a glass of port. Make sure to sit outside with views over the city. Service was great, very attentive and friendly
4
The views is what this place is all about. The Marina Bay hotel is beautiful and the views from up top are amazing. The pool area is also one you must see, which is possible if you have restaurant reservations. The chocolate spread along with the cheese spread is also impressive. It's a must do for your first trip to Singapore. Drinks are a little too pricey so don't go too thirsty
4
I echo many of the other reviewsI have a sweet tooth, love chocolate and love cheese.The food was good but not great, however the view is spectacular.This is right at the top. You can't go any higher and you walk by the infinity pool when getting to and from the venue.Price - $48 per head, however that does not include the additional 17% on top for tax and service charge.We had a wine flight each which was a glass of White, a glass of red and a glass of port. This cost us an extra $19 (plus the 17%) per person (they were small glasses though)Wine is dear in Singapore so we thought thus was reasonableSo all in all we spent about $160 (about £88) so it's not cheapIf you can afford that do it - the food is okay but OMG the view is breathtaking

First of all, i love chocolates in any form. Me and my family had chocolate buffet at 'The Chocolate Bar'. It is expensive no doubt about it. I don't mind spending if i am satisfied with overall experience. NOTE: do not forget to mention, table for outside view at the time of reservation. There were many options to choose from with free flow of TWG tea. I tried each and every dessert available except doughnuts because no one is there on fresh doughnut station till we were there. I heard from some of our friends that, after buffet they serve chocolate ice cream but, we did not get any. 2-4 desserts were very good. Rest of them were just average. I am gonna try other famous chocolate buffet. It is not for chocolate fan like me.I recommend buffet at 'the chocolate bar' only for those who want combination of high floor view and just good to average chocolate desserts
4
Located at the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands hotel. The Chocolate Bar has a good spread of chocolate desserts and cheese. Comes with coffee or tea (TWG tea). The view was just spectacular. Night view of the Gardens by the bay and the Marina Bay is awesome. Choice of indoor tables and outdoor tables. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Worth a visit if you are into chocolates. The presence of M & Ms and Milky Way brings the standard down by a few notch
5
Staying in Kitchener Road caught a cab for an 8.30pm reservation. Cab cost $14.Report to Rises Restaurant in Tower 1 check your booking and they give you a card to take to Level 57. Chocolate bar cost $38 pp and you get to the pool level. $21 gets you to the observation deck, not the pool level.Our sons birthday was highlighted by our visit to the Chocolate Bar. The selection is absolutely over the top. Anything and everything chocolate. Some favourites around the table were the Red Velvet cup cake, the chocolate coated almonds, strawberries and teaspoons of mocha ganache.Tea and coffee included.Finished the night on a high with staff singing happy birthday to our son, he was suitably embarrassed.If you want to go to the top of the Sands go for the chocolate
5
My husband and I went to the chocolate bar for my birthday, it was amazing! So many desserts to try, all in bite sized portions so you can fit them all in! The range of flavours and textures were great, all of the desserts were innovative and there wasn't one I didn't love! The view from the top of Marina Bay sands is spectacular as well, we really enjoyed ourselves and will be back next time we are in Singapore :
4
Considering it's only about 20ukp for the chocolate buffet with a drink, we found it really good value. Located on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands, the views to the south of the city are excellent. The food was good, if not a bit too much after a while!!!!!!! I would certainly recommend it. We made a reservation online, I would advise it. Try and get a table outside, or a window table inside
3
You know what they say abiut places with great view... that the food is not great.this is thru for this place as well. the chocolate was OK but not more than that. the espresso was very good. but the view south was amazing. go for the view and for drinks
4
Since it costs just a little more to go up and have all the chocolate you can handle. Why not bring out-of-towners for an impressive view with their dessert. The pool always draws oohs and aahs.
5
I took my wife for a treat of Chocolate,Champagne and gave her a Red Rose.It was a very good evening to say the least.
5
Well, we really went there to see 57th floor of the Marina Bay with the famous pool and spectacular views. The Chocolate Bar is all you can eat indulgence for Sing 44$ all in and the combination of a spectacular location and fantastic little chocolate bites/cakes/fruits and you name it is really worth it. A must go if you are in the area. The service is nice and efficient, you have dessert and something the drink in the price. The outside might be windy but it is really no issue
4
Yummy Hungry Chocolate Lover Must try The Chocolate Bar at MBS.The Chocolate buffet cost $38++ and you get Yummy good choice of Chocolate dessert with the bestTWG tea or freshly brew coffeeMake a reservation before you go as the place is pack with Tourists that willing to pay $38++ for Chocolate buffet than pay $20 just to see a nice view of Singapore.Must Try as below.1)Strawberry-Basil Truffle Pop2)Rosemary-Infused Milk Chocolate and Caramelised Pineapple3)Botanic
4
First night at Singapore,we head straight at chocolate bar to see the roof top view at the same time.The reception fom lobby very welcoming.Staff at the bar entrance fail to greet us but the guy who led us to our table serve us well.great ambiance and delicious sweet treats.Overall we are glad that we booked this bar for our MBS experience though we didnt see much due to hazy condition
4
We really enjoyed our visit to the chocolate bar! We left feeling extremely full though! The service was great throughout the evening with the waiter ensuring we always had drinks. My husband had the hot chocolate but it was a bit rich for me to have with the other desserts. I enjoyed the tea and iced water. There are so many amazing chocolate themed desserts to chose from so we decided to have half of everything each. We couldn't get through everything because we were absolutely full but we gave it a good shot. Some things were amazing, some were so, so and some I didn't like at all. I enjoyed the fresh fruit and used that in between eating more chocolate items! The hot donuts were yummy as was the ice cream. We loved walking past the pool and stopped to take some photos. It was a great night out! Just remember to book in advance. I booked online with no problems
5
Little word are needed to express the great evening we had there. The first night was full so we made a reservation for the next day, and it was seriously worth waiting for it. Being in the same industry I know how difficult it can be sometimes, but the amount of pastries and chocolate served every night and with that level of quality makes it a must go place in Singapore. If I leave there I wouldn't go every week but I would certainly bring every visitor coming my way. It is a bit expensive at first but the whole experience make you forget the price. The tremendous variety of pastries will satisfy every single taste you may have. The trick is to recognized that if you taste it all (like we did) it will seem sweet, too sweet eventually... But do not necessarily blame the chef yet... If you eat pastries after pastries everywhere every plate anywhere would seem too sweet... The view is fantastic, and it's not often but there the service was outstanding. They were helpful and smiling, and everything you could want from a service side. At firsts hot chocolate came and I was disappointed and asked if it was served usually like this, and the waiter looked at it and told me that he will make another as his colleague did not go it right. The one that came was defenitely better, thicker, richer, cocoa lips licking good...Of course I did not like everything but it did not mean it wasn't good, it only mean it wasn't to my personal taste. But don't worry there is enough choice to find happiness for everyone. I would give two thumbs up for the pastry chef, for bring able to serve everyday such a great quality of pastries. Two thumbs up to his team too and of course to great service team...

We debated over spending the $35.00 each to have dessert. After a resounding yes votes to my plea on Facebook, we made reservations. Wow, what an experience. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, the experience was almost magical. The staff was friendly and attentive. The view of the building top pool overlooking the high rise buildings was really incredible. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, easily maneuverable and softly lighted. The chocolate, oh the chocolate. It was rich, decadent, and flavourful. Everything we had was dreamy. My favorite, lavender infused moose served on a single spoon. I have never tasted anything so lovely. There was cake, candy, ice cream, mouse, pudding, anything and everything one might want. I wanted to eat more than a plate and a half, but the desserts were so rich, that is all I could take. I will go back again for sure!!! If you find yourself in Singapore and want to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, it will cost you about $20.00 to go to the top. This only takes you to a small, walled in area at the top of the buildings. You do not have access to the pool area and cannot see the pool from this platform. If you spend the $35.00 to visit The Chocolate Bar, not only do you get all the amazing desserts, you get to walk right by the pool area and linger as long as you want. This is definitely the better deal.A tourist must!

Went to The chocolate bar for someones birthday celebration. Exchanged few emails with them for some birthday surprise. When i reached the tower 1 reception counter for the chocolate bar, the person was well aware of the birthday surprise and was quite pleasant giving us a very fast check in to the lift.The lift went up quite fast ( blink my eyes and it was already like 20+ storey) Only hotel guest and restaurant guest are allowed to enter the skypark with swimming pool area but i noticed that even hotel guest have to go down to the lobby and exchange for a pass to enter as most guest were asked to go down to exchange it...(its from what i saw..maybe i was wrong..)okei so as i reached the entrance of the chocolate bar, they immediately greeted me with my name..i guess i was famous for that day as i kept calling them to change the timing and kept emailing them on previous days..(i know i dun have a name tag on my clothing for them to know my name..so i assume thats the reason..well from what i can say is the service for the welcoming part is excellent as they kept smiling at us and when we enter the restaurant, the person explain everything to us...of course we nothing he says really got thru our ears as we we so happy to see chocolates all around...turn right chocolates..turn left chocolates..turn 360 degrees all chocolates...As we sat down the waiter ask what drink would we like..i know the only drink that would drain the chocolates from my throat is either tea or pain water...coffee and hot chocolate is a no no...and since im not a plain water lover...and of course the tea is from TWG..i just had to get their teas..they got a few selection of teas..maybe around 6-8 if im not wrong..i forgot to share the tips with my partner..so she had hot chocolate..oh well at least i got to taste their hot chocolate as well..their hot chocolate isnt something to be amazed..its just that its a bit more chocolaty but quite watery.Okie time for the chocolate review...actually theres not much chocolate..i mean the real chocolate we buy from supermarket..its more to cakes, cupcakes, muffin..etc fused with chocolate.they say they have 57 types but we r just lazy to count it all..lets just summarise the whole chocolate tasting...we r totally not impressed by any of the items..okie only one item i think is nice is the cinnamon cupcake that were give for the birthday cake..even the chocolate donut is very hard like stone..the worse item was the chocolate pudding cake..or is it the bread and chocolate pudding..the moment it went in my mouth..it automatically came out..its really bad to me...i managed to try every single non-alcoholic item (i cant take alcohol)...but by 2/3 of tasting the menu..im begining to feel full...talk about chocolate overload..anywaes the portion is just right only that some of the cakes are too big a slice just for tasting...well the only thing that saved us was the ice cream...really chocolaty and nice...we knew the chocolate is not worth the 38++ we paid so we kept changing the TWG teas and tried every flavour to satisfy ourself..heeee..service wise..was ok..maybe coz theres not much people..the place had a very nice environment tho..can be said a romantic set-up..So overall all this is like a 4 in 1 offer....u get loads of chocolates + u get so call free access to the skypark + u get free access to the swimming pool + you get free TWG teas without even having to sit in the TWG restaurant and fork out a lot of money for only one teapot..if ure still not satisfied with the food..then just get out and immerse urself with the view from the skypark...that will make ure money worth..

It's been 2 days, and I'm still feeling the effects of the chocolate bar.For the price I paid, I find that there was a good selection/variety of chocolate dessert to taste. It comes in small bite size pieces so you can pretty much sample them. I wish they had a few more selection of non-chocolate dessert snacks to balance it out. Felt quiet sick of having just chocolate that night. Also, there was no hot chocolate bar like the one at The Fullerton.However, the view of the Singapore skyline makes up for the above. When making reservations, do ask for the city view unless you want the view of the ocean instead.As for service, the staff were not very attentive and we had to get the attention to clear our plates but other than that, no issues.I'll recommend this to anybody who loves having decadent chocolate with a view
