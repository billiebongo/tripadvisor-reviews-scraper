The is the second time I host a few friends. Each time the food was delicious and use quality ingredient. All the four
Crabs we order for the group have egg roe! Coffee ribs and tofu with pumpkin source was delicious.

Went with friends for dinner. The place is suitable for big groups. Crab bee Hoon and coffee spare ribs are their signature. The only down side is that dishes are slow in serving. Need reminder on some.

Must try dish- crab bee Hoon soup! It was a dish that appeared on every table. Had steamed cod fish which was a so-so. Other dishes are not as fascinating as the crab bee Hoon I realized.

Super tasty soup and that beehon soaked all the flavours in !!! The crab is fresh and sweet - amazing bowl of happiness. The deepfried pork skin and lard also gives a nice touch to the dish.

We Had lunch at this restaurant and it was superb. Loved the crab bee hoon and the coffee ribs. The place is clean and the staff were attentive. Not the easiest place to find, but the food makes the searching worth-while. At lunch time it was not too busy, but I think the evenings may be different. The price was very reasonable for what we had, and we will definitely return when we are next in Singapore

So this restaurant faces a parking lot in the hipster area of Tiong Bahru. It’s just nice to bring tourists here and talk about the times of yester- years and How singapore has progressed. This restaurant has also been here for a long time. Food was good - crab bee hoon and fishhead fried with bitter gourd. So it’s just fun.

Real good seafood restaurant that deserve to be Singapore's food ambassador instead of stuff like claimed Originator like Chicken Rice and Pork Bak Kut Tell.The Crab Mee Hoon is insanely awesome, the rest of the food is really good, too. Service was good and attentive, without being intrusive, price, I felt, was very reasonable. 5 dishes, including their signature Crab Bee Hoon (gigantic fresh crab), Coffee Pork Spare ribs, etc, for 7 pax, at S$176.Great awesome place, with lotsa street parking

Golden Spoon seafood is located near Tiong Bahru market and famous for its crab beehon, which does taste very nice and enjoyable. Besides this, their curry fish head is also pretty good, we also had chicken and some vegetables plus tofu dishes. Ambience and services are average, try to get the sitting inside as outdoor seating may sometimes too hot. Pricing is definitely not cheap but if you order the right dishes then it's worth it.

This place in Tiong Baru vicinity is a hidden gem. The crab noodle is simply divine. The noodle soak in the crab stocks with secret ingredients is yummy. The succulent crab is fresh and sweet. There is also the bamboo clam and many others. Prices are reasonable and mostly local patronage. Worth a visit

Second Time to this place. We went to J***o Riverside day before. Environment---------Typical Chinese restaurant environment. clean but a bit cramp. inside air conditioned seating and outside celling fan seatingFood----We Ordered must have "Bee join Crab, Cold Crab, coffee ribs, beancurb and veg. we did not order chilli crab as we had it before and would like to try new style of crab.Bee Hoon Crab is a "Must Order" and you can ask for more soup(free). Very Good.Cold Crab is simply delicious. You can still taste the pure sweetness of the crab without any spices or ingredients. Highly Recommended. rest of the food are good too.Service.------Shorthanded but attentive staff. You need to get their attention but they responded rather fast.price----Again, I did not manage to pay but I am quite sure it's not as high as J***oReservation is a must on Friday and weekends

This is my favourite place for crab bee hoon. Introduced to me by a local friend, it is now my go to. Highly recommended. Slighty hidden off the path. Recommend you make a booking if you're going on the weekend.

Fresh crab, shrimp, clams that are prepared to perfection, Cantonese style restaurant that is better than Hongkong. Very friendly staff with professional services. About 15 minutes by taxi from downtown Singapore.

and vegetables. Recommend book in advance for dinner.

I had one of the best crab dishes here during my Singapore trip in March! The crab bee hoon in soup was simply amazing! the crabmeat was juicy and sweet and in huge bouncy chunks! Other seafood such as salted egg yolk prawns were really nice tooThe non-seafood dishes such as chicken and pork ribs were standard quality but those crabs - i will be back

An old favourite until the pleasant owner cum manager left but I will give it another chance. When Alfred the manager was running the place he will give us top service and ensure our crab dishes came out on time. He would also select and weigh the fresh crabs and give us an estimate of what our food bill will be like. Always gave us good value

I've been here a few times before over the years but never found the food exceptional. This time is no different. Their signature, crab rice noodles, was messy to eat but not "wow". It was enhanced by the generous use of lard and lard bits. The razor clams were fresh and chewy but cooked Chinese style. My personal preference is for something a little spicy with lime and garlic. The coffee spare ribs were a little too strong with the coffee. Pumpkin tofu was more salted egg yolk tofu but tasty. The salted egg yolk prawns were the best. All in all decent but nothing memorable. The old school decor is interesting though

Having previously lived in Singapore I had a list of meals I desperately wanted to taste again. A local friend brought me here and the Chilli Crab was an absolute delight. Came with some Mantou to take up the delicious sauce (although I was just spooning it down!!!). We also had a portion of coffee ribs which is something I had not tried before but glad I have now as they were very tasty.We were lucky to get a table (so would recommend booking) but the delightful host gave us a couple of seats and I had a nice Tiger beer until a table became free. Superb all round and very enjoyable return to Chilli Crab addiction. I was so hungry for the dish I forgot to take a photo so have posted one of the post meal debri

When we want to get our local Chinese food fix, we usually come here as the food has been consistently tasty over the years and prices have remained reasonable. The food here isn't from any particular region in China we don't think - rather it represents how Chinese food has evolved in Singapore.For visitors from outside Singapore, Golden Spoon offers the opportunity to enjoy local Chinese food more typical of a suburban family style restaurant in a central location.Their greatest hits in our view are:1. Crab bee hoon - steamed crab served with thin rice noodles in a tasty seafood broth. 2. Crab fried with salted egg yoke.3. Coffee ribs (crispy deep fried pork ribs that have been marinated in coffee and molasses)4. Deep fried crispy squid5. Razor clams - steamed and served with glass noodles and garlicThe restaurant also has a modest selection of wine. You can bring your own as well though we forget what they charge for corkage.Last night we had the chilli crab with deep fried man toh (bread buns), the crab with salted egg yoke, coffee ribs, razor clams and spinach with 3 kinds of egg. All the dishes were delicious. Complimentary dessert of aloe vera jelly and chilled logans rounded off the meal nicely.We were a table of four and our meal which included a bottle of wine (French Chardonnay) totalled SGD300 (USD220).Service is friendly and efficient

Their signature dish, crab bee hoon is a must on the order list. You can taste the familiar delicious "Wok hei" in the bee hoon or the charred flavour, which is enhanced with a large broiled crab. A light gravy completes the dish. Each portion can satisfy 3-4 persons. Service is exceptionally good and advance booking is necessary

This restaurant is set in Tiong Bahru, and it is recommended that reservation be made ahead of time as the place is not too big. Good dishes include sweat and sour pork, fried prawn roll (Hei Zhou), steam fish, coffee Pork rib and crab bee hoon. I find that the crab bee hoon dish is too soupy as there is a lot of soup which may have diluted the taste. Service is prompt, and you can BYO for wine.
