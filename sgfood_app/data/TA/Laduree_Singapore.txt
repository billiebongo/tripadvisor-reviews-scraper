Im a sweet tooth. Could swap lunch for cakes and i went down here for a treat. Very very fancy and love the colors. Everything seems so cute and legit.

Basically I don't really like sweet foods, but Laduree is exceptional! I love their macaroon especially salted caramel. The texture and the filling of macaroons were marvelous! Laduree is the best macaroon that I ever had.

I love sweets but not macaroons except those from Pierre Hermes or Laduree. My first taste of Laduree is from the outlet in Paris and i really love it. Unlike some franchise whose quality differ from their original outlet, Laduree (SG) quality remains and for the price paid , i think its worth it

It's not just the Takashimaya La Durée, it's every single one of it let it be in London, Dubai or Paris! The macaroons are to die for. Even though Takashimaya has just a stall normally La Durée has a cute little cafe along with it where you could spend hours chilling.. Oh and the boxes are so cute and something you could reuse as well! If I'd ever go missing you'd find me here

Obviously terrific macaroons but rather poor service, especially in the kiosk at the entrance of Ngee Ann City, where staff is usually downright rude. Some items are outrageously priced for what they are... quite inexplicable.Otherwise, good quality macaroons and lots of flavours to chose from

I've had Laduree macarons in Paris, London, New York City and now Singapore. They have all been consistently wonderful. They may not be the best in the world, but until Pierre Herme and/or Pierre Marcolini get to Singapore, Laduree is the best here. You get what you pay for

If there was a store elsewhere in Takashimaya, I didn't find it. What I found was the designated takeaway kiosk located in the first entrance of Ngee Ann City you would see if you were walking down from ION and Wisma Atria.I was there early afternoon on a Saturday, I didn't encounter any long lines. Which was great because I couldn't really decide what flavours to go in the Singapore edition pink hard box (which survived the trip back home in my checked luggage - they're cracked, but otherwise still edible). And the staff were really patient with me and helped me along with suggestions of flavours to try. I suspect that they have a rotation of flavours, so I might go back again to see what those are, but I dunno if I could spend so much on macaroons

Visited Laduree at Takashimaya to sample their famous macarons. The place was a girly dream's paradise...quaintly French, pastel colours and dainty touches. I purchased a box of 9 macarons and the attendant was accommodating to tell me more about the flavours. They were well-stocked too. There were also a lot of merchandise (candles, keychains, tote bags, etc). I wanted a key chain and candle but they were quite pricey. The macarons tasted great (better than Pierre Herme in my opinion). The flavors were simple and straightforward but the taste delivery was excellent. My favorite is the Marie Antoinette. The strawberry was the least favorite (I think it had jam in the center). Overall, I would definitely visit again

The macaroons are delicious. My favorite was the matcha flavor. However, it is quite pricey as compared to TWG, which offer similar quality French macaroons. The prices of the boxes to which to put the macaroons are cute, however expensive, so we opted to buy just the macaroons instead. But no doubt, they offer one of the best french macaroons. I hope they soon offer seats in which customer can stop in to grab a cup of tea/desserts just like TWG

A charming fairy tale like shop in shades of pastel on the second floor of Takashimaya Shopping Centre. Right in the middle of fashion brands and next to Tiffany, it was almost missed. Wonderful macaroons at S$3.80 each. My favourite is the salted caramel. Perfectly made with crisp exterior but soft and chewy insides and rich creamy filling.
