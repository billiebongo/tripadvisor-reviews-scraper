Few places that sells good fried hokkien mee that uses thin beehoon. Ingredients are average but it is the taste of the noodles that stands out. However there is always a queue that may take 20 minutes.

Noodle too soggy and wet, but goes well with the chilli sauce , generally not enough to wok ha, Long queue , not worth the wait.

Uses the thin bee hoon with the prawn sauce it creates excellent taste. With the use of lime and red cut chilli it is really a good dish. In the 70s onwards, the fried hokkien mee hawkers started using the thicker bee hoon for their convenience as it does not stick to the wok, but there is preference by the older folks for the thinner bee hoon. However there is normally a queque that can take 10 to 20 minutes wait

Whenever I visit Singapore and that is several times a year, I always eat from this stall and it has never disappointed. I cannot get a better fried Hokkien prawn mee anywhere. The cook/owner has been making this dish for over 20 years and the lines of patrons he generates every night is fully deserved and worth the wait. I suggest you eat here while he is still able to make this special dish. 4 SGP. This stall puts to shame all those pretend prepackaged food stores in Singapore's department stores and chain restaurants.

Been there several occasion , although the the noodles is a little soggy , but still taste good with a lot of the Chilli, Long queue. If Long queue, he will reduce cooking time, thus affect the taste. I will not wait if queue is too Long.

This is one of my regular stalls that I frequent whenever I have a craving for fried Hokkien Noodles. In my opinion, its the best fried Hokkien Prawn noodles in the West.The stal has a constant long queue in front of the stall and people can wait up till 20 minutes for their order to be fulfilled. I usually order the $8 portion, which is good for at least 2 pax. The stall holder cooks the yellow noodles and thick vermicelli in prawn stock with egg and beansprouts. The stall owner will then add in sliced squid and prawns for each order.What I like about the noodles is the stock that he uses to simmer and cook the noodles. There are days when the noodles taste so heavenly, that it can be my last meal. There are also days when the noodles are sub-par, But thankfully the sub-par standard are few and far between. I put it to long hours of working behind the hot stove, as the stall owner is the sole person cooking 6 days a week. His off day is every Wednesday. The chilli is also unqiue, as it has fried ikan billis mixed in. It goes very well with the noodles. If you canâ€™t take chilli, ask for the chilli to be packed separately.They also give cut lime which adds flavour to the noodles, when you squeeze the lime over the noodles.Highly recommended
