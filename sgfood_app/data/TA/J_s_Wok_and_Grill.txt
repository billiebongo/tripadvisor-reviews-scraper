For the price, Its worth the quality of food! Only if it comes with discounts from fellow merchants.

We went to this restaurant with the help of the fave app which gave us a good discount. Great food for its price and hearty portions.

Was here with my mom for lunch. Ordered the salmon carbonara and beef lasagna. Portions are big and generous. Food is tasty and nicely done. Highly recommended!

Nice affordable western food that's halal. Great services as well. Watch out for Eatigo and Groupon promotions whenever these are available!

Visited the restaurant a few day ago after many good reviews on J wok and grill.
The price was somehow reasonable and the food wise was very nice and tasty.

That will be our 3rd visit. We ordered the Humuz & pita bread, beef ribs (very tender and BIG), mushroom steak (a bit like McD layout) and the chickpea soup. Yummy....

Love the location, central yet a quieter part of Tampines. It's facing the new Our Tampines Hub.Simple ambience and friendly staff. Mainly western delights with a few local dishes e.g. Char kway teow and mee rebus. Prices are mid-range but better for those on promotion. Enjoyed the fragrant spicy shrimp spaghetti. Tenderloin beef was ok, liked side cubed potatoes but not the sautÃ©ed capsicums. Buffalo wings are juicy but could not appreciate the cut raw cucumbers (the smell & taste....was vinegar added or something?) Lasagne has generous portion of beef.Overall, decent experience.

This is a halal social enterprise restaurant and got quite crowded and noisy for Saturday dinner. After waiting a while, I decided to order at the counter. Fortunately the food came quite fast within 15 min for our seafood Au gratin and chicken quesadilla, iced lychee. The waitress dropped the salad on the seafood dish and had to return to the kitchen to replace the salad, But she never bothered to clean the salad on the floor. Food was average but perhaps we should have ordered the beef ribs as I saw many ordering that. Besides western, they have Asian dishes from Thai, Malay. For the payment, I had to remind staff we had a discount from eatigo. Our bill: $28 after 20% discount for a 7 pm slot , reasonable bill but poor service!

Prices are reasonable and dishes taste pretty fair. Good ambience to be honest. It felt warm and welcoming. A good place for a family meal and friends. Would prefer to have the Braised Lamb Shank's sauce to be more flavourful. It lacks the body and character. The Buffalo Wings in the other hand really need to be spicy. It's more like Tomato Sauce Chicken Wings. It's just sweet and has a strong hint Maggi's Tomato Sauce. No particular heat or spiciness to the wings itself
