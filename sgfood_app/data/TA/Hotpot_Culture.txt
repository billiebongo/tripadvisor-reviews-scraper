The quality and prices in the restaurant is acceptable.
The heart and soul of a hotpot depends a lot of the soup, which in this place is .... nothing to talk about.

We enjoyed the full buffet steamboat which offers more than 40+ choices of alacarte dishes and it was a good variety of food to try. Have been celebrating my moms birthday for the past 3 years with my family. She enjoys the food here especially the tom yam base soup, garlic fried rice, asam fish and prawn paste chicken. It's a family friendly place and the service was normal. For dessert we enjoyed the wide variety of ice cream we could choose and mix. It's more for value for money

Excellent food. Prices unbeatable in all of Singapore. Services unmatchable. Mr. Lim as owner will take time to chat with his customers and make them feel at home. The experience here makes me feel Singapore after all is home away from home. 10 out if 10. Minh Ho, Canad

There are a good range of food to choose from for your Hotpot. The service staff are attentive and friendly.
Everyone gets an individual small Hotpot to customize your soup and ingredients.

Great place for steamboat buffet and ala carte buffet dinner with family and friends gathering at a good cost, value for money.
If you want comfort go for the porridge buffet from 12 noon to 2.30 pm - simple home cooked food.

My sister and I enjoyed swirling the free-flow of fresh meats and greens in the many choices of flavorful soup broth. Homemade dipping sauces and condiments added fire and kick. Delightful side dishes tasted like our grandma's secret recipe!

Perfect for lunch or dinner outing with family and friends. Very authentic and great value oriental Hotpot. Very balanced. My favorite is the Tom Yam soup base, which infuses the Hotpot items with a flavorful spiced taste.

Just had dinner with my family there last week. Hot & spicy soup is great! Good range of variety for steamboat :) Ala carte dishes are pretty tasty too. I personally like the sambal sotong and crispy bacon prawn. Will bring my friends over next time ^
