Fresh Seafood, wide varieties of selection and with reasonable price. Nice place to go for dinner and must try their Chendol!
4
Just ok, not really special, but the taste ok, the bakuteh soup delicious but the meat a bit hard, fish mao very good,
4
It was overall a fantastic dining experience, spacious and with a wide variety of sauces/dips selection for your customization. Soup bases were great too and dishes were affordable, especially generous with their meat platters. Will definitely re-visit again!
3
The ambience in the venue was quite chilled and relatively quiet, and service was quite prompt. Would recommend the fresh fish maw, fried bean curd skins. But the pricing for the set meal was really costly for the quantity of the food served.
5
Service staff were mostly friendly and ready to serve at the restaurant. Nice place for individual hotpot
4
Food was good. I like how the individual pots allowed customers to try the different soup bases. Reservation required, do book in advance
5
Staff member do explains on the rewards membership that they're having as well as pretty attentive to our callings and our needs.

Came back to celebrate a couple of birthdays. Service here is very friendly and they even give you plastic pouches for your handphone in case of spills.You get individual pots of soups, and you can choose from a variety, including herbal and their superior chicken stock. The weekday set lunches are around $17, and come with some seafood, vegetables and a choice of pork collar or chicken slices. There is also the option of ordering ala carte dishes like liver etc.This includes free flow soft drinks, or barley and lohanquo
4
I like that every individual have their own pots and can order different soup. They have multiple soup choices which all taste good. Food is ala carte. Drinks are self-service, which I find it troublesome. Price is not very expensive but my friends think that, with the same price, they can have better quality food at hai di lao.
5
I should say WOW! I really don’t know which part of the pork does the seasoned pork belongs to BUT it’s very soft! Even without my creation of dipping sauce it taste wonderful! The Yong Tau Fu are so good! The meat is sweet! Not to mention that the soup base taste wonderful without MSG! I don’t find it thirsty after we hav finished our lunch for a very long while! The spinach tofu is the most tasty that I’ve ever tasted & the pork cheese balls are sooooooo goooood! Though overall we spent 110 for 3pax, my kids never stop mentioning till now! We will be back
5
I like this place.. comfort food for the stomach & very warm customer service.
Food slightly on the pricy side but definitely worth it. Will dine again n again!
4
Wish they still had the duck and salted veg soup. However it was still very good. Fresh seafood was excellent
5
Reservation service was prompt. we were early by 15 mins.. food and service was good.will recommend the service app to my fiends and family. Thank you, Thumb ups!
5
Comforting meal to suit the cold weather. Hearty soups with fresh food and a great selection of chilli
4
Food was good but should always have new varieties. wasn’t informed that the soup based that i chose was not available till i sent my order.
3
Food was quite delicious, service was fantastic. But I thought it was quite expensive though. The dishes felt like what a usual hotpot stall would have. But prob you're paying for the superb service and it's speedy refills.
5
Tried on the new Chilli crab soup base. Very fresh crab and nice sauce. All food are fresh. Good service too. Just that it limited to 1.5hrs, which I have to rush at the end

My boyfriend and I had dinner at JPOT Tampines 1 on Friday night and resulted in food poisoning. We both suffered from severe diarrhoea and vomiting that midnight at 4am. I went to the doctor and had an injection. I was asked to emit to the hospital by the doctor to get IV fluids and I was highly dehydrated. I have been advised by my GP that the food poisoning almost certainly resulted from the food which had been eaten at your restaurant. On the other hand, my boyfriend was down with diarrhoea the whole day. That was the last meal we had at your restaurant. In light of this matter, we will lodge a complaint to NEA about what causes us to suffer from food poisoning
5
My preferred steamboat restaurant as it is situated at Tampines 1, near my house. My favourite is still Hai Di Lao now they have opened at Bedok Mall and I have personally tried. But due to the waiting time and the queue, Jpot is fine as well
4
As usual, find Jpot staff courteous and helpful in enquiries. Dine with my young son 4 1/2 yo in presence and he was not required to order a soup base for himself. Made reservation through Chope which was handy. As visit was on Christmas eve dinnertime, was limited to 1.5 hrs dining. Food was good and fresh. Delightfu
4
Always in my list of steamboat restaurants! It’s been competitive and they have been up to it with food n services. Never disappoints. Thumbs up to attentive service staff, good environment and great food!
5
food is more hygiene and presentable. service and atmosphere are good.
restaurant is suit for young to old.
5
2nd visit for birthday celebration , good environment and enjoy the food . Good idea for the individual pot, no sharing.
4
The soups are awesome! Surprised by the chilli crab soup... homemade prawn balls are nice, must try.
4
Timing was perfect no delay for the booking n service n assistance regarding ordering of food was also good
4
Overall good dining experience over at JPot Tampines One. Food served were fresh and whole lot of condiments to choose from to make your own little concoction. On a slight note, food items were slightly pricier compared to other hotpot restaurants.
2
This is an a-la-carte meal, not even a buffet. why do they need to restrict how long we can eat in the restaurant? This is supposed to be a meal for my parents as my mum's birthday just passed and i was not in SingaporeOnly 6:30pm and 8pm is available for booking as all the restaurant cared about was turnover. I wanted to book at 7pm because there is no way i can reach at 6:30pm.8pm is way too late for my 70 year old parents. I asked my parents to wait in the restaurant as i reached only at 7pm. by 7:45pm we were reminded that we had to leave in 15 mins and we were not even near done with our meal. We had to just throw everything in and finish up our meal. We cant even order anything else. As mentioned, this is a la carte. Not Buffet
5
This is one of the go-to place for my family to enjoy steamboat. My kids enjoy having their individual pots with whichever broth they prefer and there is a wide selection of food to order. Service is always good and the overall experience has been a enjoyable. That's why we keep coming back
4
Food was ok but abut overpriced for the types of food we had. Service was considered very good _ auto top up, quick and personable response despite using technology to place order. A bit screwed up when they couldnâ€™t find my reservation until I showed them my reservation sm
5
This is 1 of the best place for hot pot. Warm customer service, fresh food and good broth. Just that you have to book a table early and they will ask you for the table back if you are taking the 1st seating. Slightly pricey but still worth a try
4
Went to the restaurant for a meal. Whole experience was okay except in the beginning where I was given the wrong table and have to move to another table. Service wise was okay and soup was good.
4
the food and soup base is nice. staff is friendly too. but it would be better if the price could be lower
4
Some of the dishes already sold out at during dinner time 6pm!
Should replenish the dishes instead of sold out so early.
4
Only down side is that the fish tank is under renovation so there were no live seafood. Therefore they should have advised customers upon booking.
4
When we arrived, we needed to change our number from 5 to 3 and there is no fuss at all. Everything works well. Food was served fast and efficiently.
5
Great service and food was fresh and good! Order was very fast and staff were attentive in topping up the soup.
4
Quality of the pork and beef is very good. Good value. Also loved the chilli crab seasonal offerings.
4
Service was good. Food served quite efficient and sauce selection is good. However, the soup base standard dropped. Quite disappointing no salted veg duck soup.
4
This is a steamboat restaurant operated by the Jumbo group. As a member of Jumbo, I was entitled to a Birthday e-voucher of $50 for a minimum $100 spend. We ordered a set menu for 2 and a pot of soup for my young son, plus a chilli crab. The crab is cooked in pot of tomato-based soup for at least 5 minutes. This soup can be transformed into the signature chilli crab sauce by adding egg and special corn flour. No worry, the staff will do it for you in your presence. Overall the food is good and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable to advise on the menu
1
Your cashier at Tampines One really not flexible. Was there with my Wife for her birthday treat. We didn't know that we have to spend $100 sub total bill as it is not stated in your birthday card/voucher. Our bill was $86 sub total so we ask if you can add any item that worth that amount to reach $100 to get the birthday treat. The response was a rude NO! What a destroyed birthday celebration
4
Food was pricey, but justified by good quality and freshness. Comfortable and spacious restaurant. However, whilst the restaurant tries to be tech-savvy and encourages customers to order food using the tablets, there should be an option to order via the staff on site.
4
J pot has always been of high quality and they have kept their standards high.. Great soup base...always gr8 after a long work day
1
Always good always fresh food!
A lil pricy thou, but definitely worth the price. Love dining here every time
4
Make resveration. Parking at Tampines One is difficult. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is fresh and selection is wide. Quality is consistent with other outlet/s. But the stove heating at our table was a bit problematic and slow. Overall, had a great meal.
4
Overall good experience, the reservation through Chope save us waiting time. The food was delivered fast and value for money.
3
Traditional and ordinary soup base options. Ingredients are a bit pricey. Not too many choices too. Service is prompt though. This had been the case since years ago when Jpot came into the market. They haven't changed since.
4
Good steamboat. Food were delicious and fresh. There is free flow of soft drink at additional cost. Will revisit agian.
4
Speedy service with a good variety of food, soup and sauces. Just no ma la soup. Perhaps the digital menu can be more friendly - as least it should correspond to the analogue menu.
5
Must make reservations, otherwise be prepared to wait for over an hour to get a table. Fuss-free dining for families with kids.
5
The overall experience here was fantastic! Loved the freshness and tenderness of the food items for the steamboat. Their tom yum soup base was good too! Liked the good service provided by their wait staffs and it is similar to haidilao but at much cheaper and value for money prices. Would highly recommend!
3
Soup was quite salty but many types to chose from. Variety of food was lacking. Sacha sauce could be better. But will return.
5
Great food! Fabulous service! Birthday voucher for members is great! The price can be more affordable, though.
4
delicious broth, fresh meat and seafood and GREAT choices for condiments (love it!). A bit on the pricier side and the environment/ furniture and fittings could've been better.
5
Nice food value for $$$. Service is good too... Many choices of soup base to choose from, especially my Favourite bak kut teh.
4
Is was a good place to celebrate birthdays. Food was nice, ambience was great but the servive was average as the food was served too abruptly.
2
Food served haphazardly -
Starters/appetizers served only after everything else. Orders forgotten. Portions are very small for a $68.80 set.
4
Service is good.
Food preparation is fresh
Value for money
Good location
Jumbo members get discount
Lucky Draw
5
Fresh fresh fresh food. We had a huge promfret & lobsters. Food is still amazing & the staff working very hard, especially Kelvin. All the staff here are so friendly and courteous. Smiling even when it gets so busy. We enjoyed our dinner. Thank You!
5
Jpot was one of my favourite steamboat restaurant. Been there a couple times as I really love their laksa pot and all ingredients were so fresh. Decided to bring my overseas friend for dinner at Jpot as itâ€™s really highly recommend. Friends had a great dinner and said this is so far the best laksa steamboat pot they ever tried. They loved it ! Thanks Jpot ! I will definitely be back again
5
Upon arrival, was immediately ushered in as we had made reservations. Service crew was very attentive without us having to beckon much. Service crew kept asking if we needed refill for our soups. I have patron this outlets many times as it was the closest to my home but have found it to be the most satisfying as compared to the other branches. Overall, it was a very comfortable and pleasant dining experience
3
I have been a JPot fan for many years, however I feel their standard has dropped over these couple of years and pricing has been increasing continuously.
Management should review and compare with the current competition.
5
Thank you Jpot for the amazing food and service. As a frequent diner at jpot, i truly enjoy my time there during every visit.
3
Did not like their soups. Food variety was good but taste average. Service crew were good. Wouldn't go back though.
4
Good environment and location is near mrt station. Will come with family next round. Food is fresh too.
4
Made reservations for 8pm, was showed in to our seats quite quickly. Everything was good, except for the food variety which was alright and the price could be better.
4
Been this restaurant more than 10 times . Always enjoy their steamboat . Out of 10 visit , 1 time the soup was more diute
5
Many types of soup base to choose from, all amazingly tasty and goes well with all the steamboat dishes. Super good customer service, attentive and polite (the moment we were seated, the friendly servers brought us zipped bags for our phones). All the steamboat ingredients are very fresh, price is very reasonable. We were there when there was a promotion and got ourselves 20% off ! Good deal !
2
Went for dinner with colleague. Food is rather good but pricey. Tables are close to each other, lack of lack of privacy, not suitable if you need a place for meal and serious discussion. Service is simple, for this kind of price, i would expect more
3
Table was not ready when we arrive at 8pm. Waited for additional 10mins for our tableAmbient is good, chair are comfortable, sauce table are clean and presentable.Serving of food is fast, as usual fresh and tasty.They used to serve free Ice water, but not is chargeable (Mineral water).However was super thirsty after the dinner (too much MSG?
4
Has a wide variety of dishes to choose from.The herbal & bak kut tea soup bases are very good and true to its taste.Service staff were friendly and helpfulIf you are doing single pot, it is not conducive for big groups as you can be quite far apart
4
nice food, good service but pricey.
Selection of seafood is lacking and afternoon sun sure shine in on certain areas making the place hot and almost unbearable having steamboat
Chope vouchers should have less restrictions!
3
Food was decent. Service was not bad. I had high expectations from this place but I wasn't really wowed by the food. It is nonetheless decent. Food can be quite pricey.
4
Went to the restaurant to celebrate my son 2nd birthday. Was a bit disappointed as 2 of the soups we wanted were not available. Other than that, the rest of the items were but the soup is thr main star. Service was friendly and nice.
4
Love that they have many soup base to choose from and that they have a wide spread of food. Jpot had always been one of my to go places when I have cravings for steamboat.
5
The lunch sets at Tampines branch are worth it especially when you can use the J vouchers too which was what I did.
The DIY dips let you create what suits your taste. Love the range of condiments provided.
3
The food was ok. Spent around $35 per person. Didn't have much food. The lean pork and beef is quite tough. The marinated pork is better.
4
The food have many variety .. the soup is good. It have many choices to chooses too. The source is perfectly good and many choices..
4
Was allocated a table with aircon blowing directly from the top, and requested for a change of table despite peak hours, with near full house. Staff accommodated to our request politely and were efficient in attending to our needs.
4
Everyone gets individual pots, there is a sauce bar you get to create your own sauces at. Dishes we love to order, the fried bean curd skin and yam slices. Prices can go a little into the higher end but if you come for their weekday set lunches, it's good value.
4
Their salted duck soup is sooooo good! The best thing is the refill for soup is legit the same as what is given in the first pot. You know some places will dilute subsequent refills and spoil the taste of soup. Meat and others were delicious and fresh as well. Im a fan!
4
Like their local soup bases, always bring the family and friends here. Their seafood is very fresh and service is quite good as well.
3
The quality of the food is relatively reasonable but the service staffs need to be more meticulous towards the customers
5
Booking was easy and food is fresh. Seating place is comfy and place is quite spacious for kids to walk around.
3
This steamboat is one of those that i will patronize. Taste is good, food is clean, brooth is nice. Just the price is on the higher side
5
Very fresh ingredients; clean place and wide variety of soup base and food and hotpot ingredients to enjoy
1
Bad service. Impolite staff and lack of initiative. Refilling of soup was not prompt and hard to get the attention of service staff.
4
The service is good, staff are polite. Total 10 of us went for the set lunch, with free flow of drinks.
4
Enjoyed the dinner at Jpot with friends and family. It was a good dinner with variety and we love the soup base. Service was attentive.
4
The food is really fresh and tasty with delicious broth base, especially the laksa broth. The place is clean and spacious, so really comfortable dining at the place.
4
Overall the quality of the food is fresh, wide variety of selection and great service! Tables were moderate apart from others as well, just nice for private talks.
5
friendly and attentive staff. Service was Good. Clean Environment. Foods served within 15 minutes after ordered.
5
We visit the outlet at Tampines One once a month in average. The restaurant is spacious, the servers are polite and attentive and most importantly the food they serve are fresh, great variety and at affordable price compared to some of the famous steamboat places.
5
The Bak kut teh never fails to hit the spot. Really delicious and the selection is wide, love their choices of food and their crispy you tiao.
4
Good service & staff are friendly & helpful, will bring family the next round. A nice place to have family gathering or celebrations!
3
Been to this place couple of times. Food are fresh but pricy. Overall still fine. Have a nice side counter to do your own sauce etc.
5
The staff was great when I requested for soup with no MSG. The refill soups were no MSG too. Thanks a lot!
4
The broth are nice especially ba kut teh.
The food are fresh and are served in good portion. Just that the price is on the high side.
5
There are multiple choice for the soup base. Each person get to pick their own soup and cook on their own on their side of the table!
5
I enjoy dinning at jot as the food are fresh and good. The staff are also very attentive and responsive. Great place to dine with family. Bad thing is that your clothes will smell of the steamboat after leaving the place.
3
Staff wasnt attentive. Moreover it was rather empty in the restuarant during the HI tea time. There was a couple of staff around but no one really attend to us. Our soup was almost finished but no one asked if we want a top up. There is no bag storage bucket provided and we got to put the bag on our laps throughout the mail. The only good thing about jpot is the seasoning.. other than that, food is expensive and dont even deserve to charge us service charges..
5
At 12.80++, the lunch set at Tampines Jpot is good value for money. It even comes with free flow drinks. The star of cos has to be the dip you can create to suit your taste. Mine has lots of sesame seed and garlic!
5
My parents enjoyed the set lunch meals very much as the ambience was comfortable and having an individual pot makes eating steamboat an enjoyable experience. My kids were happy to be there again slurping instant noodles with chicken broth.
5
Environment was good and the food is fresh and superb. Service was good as well, friendly staffs and very attentive.
5
Excellent service.. Food as usual was good and fresh. Broth selections were good and yummy. Value for money
5
The experience was excellent. The staff response when help needed and also didn't wait long for the table to be cleared.
3
Been a while since I last visited this outlet. Service is fast and prompt. Soup based are good. Freshness of the seafood can be improved. The fish paste noodles I had tasted funky and the fish balls were fishy and not fresh at all. My previous visit was so much better and I love their fish paste noodles, hence I ordered again this time round. However, I was disappointed and in the end left the fish paste noodles left untouch and removed from the soup based after one mouth. Hope they can check daily for the freshness of the seafood.
3
Find the place too overpriced. Food quality was average and the customer service has lots of room for improvement. The ingredients came before the broth and we were waiting for the broths for 5 mins until we called up to one server to ask about the broth. Turned up that the broths were placed on a trolley beside us all along.
5
Jpot has always served quality selection of food since I started dining at this restaurant. The service by their staff always exceeds my expectation. Even though the price can be a little pricey, but it's all worth it with the comfortable ambience, good quality food and excellent service. It's my fav steamboat place!
5
Jpot never disappoints with their rock solid good soup and ingredients. The only time it is a good bargain is when you dine during their high tea promotions; three of us spent $100 (before 10% service charge and 7% GST) for our dinner.The recommended dishes to order would be the mutton strips and the handmade pork balls (which we added garlic and chili padi into the mix before boiling). The pork belly was not bad, but the chicken and beef were of an acceptable (but not fantastic) standard if you eat it plain without dipping sauces. The immense spread of the dips/sauces that you can mix to your heart's delight should satisfy most self-proclaimed food critics and home chefs
4
quality of food is consistently good and staff are mostly attentive and accomdating. it's worth the price if you're willing to splurge. but they usually have promotions so it's still wallet friendly. 4 of us just visited a few days back and the bill came out to be about $220. it was my birthday month and being a member, they gave me a $100 discount voucher. so effectively only paid about half of what we ordered.
5
fuss free with discount when using chope, recommended. look out for discounts on chope website to get value for money deals
5
Good and premium meat available, overall good soup base. Slightly on the high side in terms of pricing but do take advantages of chope vouchers or register as a JUMBO REWARDS member!
3
Went there for a simple dinner with one colleague. Spent $90 for simple ordering. Can try the porridge soup base
4
Food were fresh and very delicious. However, I wouldn't say it's value for money because it can be quite expensive. But for the food I ordered, I thought it was okay. Service wise.. staffs can be more attentive. But overall, good experience, definitely coming back!
4
The seafood really fresh & the original soup base is so tasty. You do not feel thirsty after finishing the whole pot. Though the price is a bit pricey but it's really worth to eat!
5
Enjoyed the experience, comfortable ambience and efficient service.
Nice spread of variety of dishes.
However the induction hot plates needs servicing or replacement
4
It was a bit pricey for the amount of food, but the environment was reasonably comfortable. Did not enjoy paying for water though
4
Ingredients are fresh and served fast. Hassle free experience and nice dining ambience for steamboat.
5
The food is fresh and there's a pretty good range to choose from. Love the sauce. You can create your own special dip as a tasty accompaniment to the meats and vege.
5
It seems like better value than Haidilao. Worth a visit to check things out. Didn't break the bank. Soup base was salty but maybe that's me, ingredients fresh. Good for big gatherings and such. First time visit. Didn't know it was run by the jumbo group
4
a little expensive but affordable ya requested for a bigger round table as sharing the pot.good and crowded.
4
Reservation was hassle-free. Mostly self-service. Depending on where you are seated, you might not get good service as service staff seldom walk by. Food is nice but pricey.
4
Dinner with friends for steamboat. Was a great time hanging out with friends at jpot. Food and soup was good.
5
The service was good. Staff accommodated my last minute request. Food was fresh and variety was good.
4
Nice variety but the place is very busy and their insistance that every person has their own soup makes ut hard for communal eating.
5
Excellent food, service was good. Reasonable pricing. 4 pax dined for $120 (including gst and service charge)
4
As usual, they are consistent with their food quality. Service is good too.
Just that they dun serve free plain water anymore.
5
Jpot offer Excellent Food and Friendly Service. Many handmade or special items available and fresh seafood if willing to spend more. Wonderful experience.
4
A nice hot meal on a rainy day. Good broth, fresh seafood & nice dip created the way you want it. Yummy!
4
Service quite impressive except the staff at the payment counter extremely slow and bad attitude. I was queueing up for payment and when it's my turn she told me that there's another guest she need to attend to who is not even queueing up. Food wise they have at least 6 types of soup base for you to choose from, the food is very fresh. They have set menu for you to choose from but I order ala-carte
4
Enjoy my dinner experience with a good friend. Very good experience and my friend love the food so much. Pricing a bit high, but overall I will still happy to grade them 👍👍👍
3
Need to prompt the waitress to help clear the plates when new food delivered. Also many items are sold out despite going around 12.30pm.
5
Reservation was fuss free and we were seated immediately upon arrival. Service & food was good too. Would book through Chope again.
5
Always enjoyed the food at jpot which could order individual soup base and seafood was always fresh and fried stuff are pipping hot. Waitress we're very attentive and always fill up our soup without asking
5
Went jpot twice in a week. Their soup selection is superb and I especially love the laksa and fish head soup base. Price is affordable and definitely a must try
4
Service was prompt and the waitresses were very attentive to me and my little girl. They come by a few times to offer us containers to place my bags, zip lock bag for my phone. So sweet!!!
4
Service was ok as the restaurant is not very crowded. Food is fresh and set lunch is pretty worth it.
5
great food.. the soup base and ingredients.. fresh and good in quantity.. and the sauces are very nice too! :)
3
It's been a while since the family ate in Jpot Tampines. Anyway, we chose to dine there recently after the kids school holidays start. Food still good but the prices are now higher. They also started charging for corkage. And now, they have even stopped serving free water. So you either pay for bottled water or for free flow drinks. So it's a lot more expensive to dine here
3
Food from Jumbo group is always good. However we feel that the tables were too near to one another. We can listen to the exact conversation of our next table...mind you...they are not shouting! Having said that, I presume they also hear ours. It was a weekday afternoon which was not crowded, so tables occupancy could have been alternate, rather than squeeze all diners at one row
3
Freshness is guaranteed, however its too expensive. Seafood platter is definitely not value for money.
4
Service was prompt and appropriate. Food quality is also above average as compared with other hot pot restaurant. Become a member and you will get more benefit.
4
Tasty steamboat! Good soup base and variety of sauces.
Just that the price is the the high side else would be perfect.
4
Attentive and helpful staff who chased all the way out when my friend didn't even realised she had forgotten to take her laptop after our meal.
5
The service was good. Well attended to.
Food was served fast for cooking after ordering.
Nice overall experience
5
Food is fresh espically the seafood. They gave small bags to put handphone and did not charge corkage for wine.
5
As above, service has been consistently good at Jpot and I like the freshness of the food served. Pricing is decent as well, especially to look out for promotions/set-lunch/dinner deals.
Good for family and friends.
5
It was a first time visit for my friends to visit Jpot. The turnout was great. Food was good and everything went well. Will visit again !
5
always enjoy the food there with good ambiance. but the price is getting higher. overall, will still go back again.
4
Jpot has always been serving good quality food, though it's a little pricey.
And they have recently stopped providing water at.no cost.. =(
4
Good ambience and helpful staff! Food selections were good with many varieties. We had a table of 12.
3
It used to be my favourite till they did away with the free flow of water. Now its just overpriced with small portions. Its saving grace its the variety of soup bases and good staff.
I wont be going there in a hurry.
5
Food was fresh, service was fast. Jumbo restaurants live up to their reputation. Highly recommend buying Groupon vouchers - value for money!
5
Nice food with nice soup, and service is good too! Soup has many varieties and food is very fresh. Service is tip-top, and waiter and waitresses are all friendly. Very clean place and nicely arranged.
4
No more free flow plain water from August, $0.80 for water, expensive. Usually I will order $3.80 free flow soft drink and take plain water when feel too sweet/salty with drink/soup.
3
Good service. Restaurant is clean and well Organised. Plenty of sauce options to choose from. However, soup stock is quite lacking for steamboat. Some soup stock is quite salty. Result not good when adding ingredients.
4
Quality of food is above average compared to many other steamboat restaurants of the same price range. The soup base was good, although the superior soup may be slightly salty according to my friends. Portion was on the small side for the price, so the dollar value is a negative point, but overall it's a great place to have a meal with family and friends. Had the seafood platter, and the freshness is lacking. But everything else was great.
4
We went there previously without reservation and was made to wait as it is the peak hour (8pm). However, we left because the waiter was unable to inform us how long we had to wait as they had a full reservation for the day.The next time round we went after securing a reservation. Process was fast, from queue to getting the seat. Food came pretty fast as well and we felt that they are quite fresh! We had the dinner set meal which had quite a good variety of seafood, poultry and vegetables. Will go back again
4
sets are good value although still a bit steep. regretted selecting the marinated beef and chicken meats though, as they tasted rather strange. i guess steamboat is still better with non-marinated meats. but we were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant honoured our reservation even though we were very late (due to being held up in traffic), thumbs up for that
4
I've always like to dine here as the DIY sauce at JPOT is one of our favourite. It's not chargeable like some other hotpot restaurants and the special soy sauce is so addictive. Price is reasonable and I would say it's value for money. Waiters just need to pay a little more attention to diners as we need to wave a long time before we get their attention.
5
Food is very expensive, should consider reduce price. Quantity very little. Can't eat full kind unless spend 50-60

Had arrived earlier than scheduled and the place had not been filled yet. Service in general was good and serving of food within 15mins of our order. Had a great dinner. Thanks
4
Delicious soup base and fresh food. Good service. Did not have to wait long for the food to arrive at our table.
4
Nice presented with fresh ingredient. Comfortable environment with free wifi.
Sad to know that they will not be serving ice water with effective from 1st Aug.
4
Nice place for individual hotpot with a few broths to choose from. love the peppery bak gu teh broth in particular, but the rest are tasty as well. Nice place to dine in for family or big gatherings.
4
Good food at reasonable cost. Really like JPOT's superior broth and the selection of food. Was in luck where the iberico pork was on promo which was even better value for money. One of my top few choices for steamboat.
4
All the food were fresh and the soup was very flavorful. However the price is very steep, especially for non-meat items like mushrooms and vegetables
4
Nice place and good environment, food serve was fast. A lot of soup to choose from. We visited Tampines Jpot, what we like best is the black pork
4
Nice to partner with Chope for the reservation. It was easy to reserve seats.
The food quality is good and their variety is quite ok.
However, pricing is steep and there is an obvious lack of serving staff.
4
Having patronise JPot for some years, one can't help to observe that the cost of dinning has gone up tremendously. A set meal for 4 amounts to a whopping $175 now, compared to less than $100 some time ago. Customers will think twice again if the price is getting out of hand
4
Nice food and soup base! One of the best steamboat I tried! Would be best if they could offer more discount! Den I would patronize often!
1
My husband had food poisoning and still vomiťting and diahrrea till now! I was a little lucky to have just diahrrea only. I wonder what went wrong in this meal
5
Fresh food! Excellent service! Value for money! We used to patronize VivoCity branch. Came here once in Mar 2016 & my mum likes the staff service here. Came again in May 2016.
4
Expensive as usual. 3.5 of us were there. Bill came up to about $160. For that, you can get lots of food for steamboat. Only thing great is the pork. Lol. Shabshabu and eat.
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday there. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and accommodatinh with our request for a good table and birthday surprises.
4
two Australians getting a Singapore feel with one Singaporean and one local American. hot pot was very nice and wish we had one in the states!
2
Choices were limited, and costly.. Wouldn't go for second visit... Tables separation beside each other was too huge
4
Great food, excellence service. We tried 4 soup base, laksa, superior soup, silky porridge and fishhead. All taste great but the silky porridge need to be stir constantly to avoid burnt and was difficult to handle. We burnt the first pot and the restuarant change that for us. So glad they did. Thumbs u
5
I tell you ah, I go J Pot anywhere also never disappointed one. People say it's because you cook your own food- how to disappointed! But I tell you ah, the service very fast and good one. Always polite, and got very "can do" attitude one, never say "cannot" unless really cannot. We were seated down so fast, I order food also my soup come in less than 3 minutes. It took longer for me to punch in my order in the tablet than it did for the food to come. Very fast! The new place is very spacious, so you don't feel like it's very cramp like sardine. The branch at parkway very cramp, this one very nice. Must die die visit! But of course make booking ah... jumbo always crowded one! Shiok shiok Shiokadoos!!!
5
We were seated in minutes (we made a reservation), and our orders arrived within 3 minutes of us placing them (ordering is self-service and automated). Fast, prompt service, and the staff were quick to respond if we had any additional inquiries. The ambience was one of the best; its new, and very spacious so you don't feel like you're packed like sardines close to other guests. Always a pleasure eating at any J Pot branch
5
Yummy food. Loved the sauces and the home made drinks. Great variety. Love the soup bases as well. The Laksa soup base was the best.
4
Good food and service. Just that food prices are slightly exp. Had this before so good to know they're maintaining the QoS
5
Jpot is one of my favorite restaurants. The service is prompt and friendly. Food is always fresh and tasty.
5
We love the ambiance , fresh food , quick ordering & most of all the attentive service everytime we visit this outlet.
We are 2 different families who meet up for dinner here on a monthly basis.
4
Food varieties were wide and good selections especially the sauces.
Able to self order which speed up the ordering process.
4
Found the food and atmosphere excellent. Had a good weekend lunch with my family. Pleasant experience that I would recommend to others to include in their 'makan' plans.
5
Family of six at a round table. Food was excellent. Service was prompt and friendly. Recommend that booking is made prior to visit.
2
soup wasnt really fanatastic. esp the j pot soup base. not value for money. order lou hei, the portion was smaller than last year i visited
5
Definitely one of my favourite hotpot restaurants! Prompt service by friendly staff. My 3 choices of soup would be superior broth, fish soup and bak kut teh. And they serve awesome fish skin! I also like that they have a sauce bar.I would strongly recommend to make a reservation at least 3 days before should you wish to dine to avoid the long queue.
4
Everything is fine except portion getting lesser. Ordered a whole geoduck which cost about the same as G7 so consider price ok for me, very gd of the staff to intro me to the geoduck eggs which I never try before elsewhere. Overall experience is fine
1
Should not restrict timing for customers. If not enough seats or tables then should not accept so many reservations. Price also too expensive. A decent meal will easily add up to 100+ for 2 pax.
3
Table space is too cramp to have more varities of food selection. Food portion can be more generous.
5
Food was fresh and really tasty. Service was fast and ready to cater to our needs even though the restaurant was packed. A little pricey though for the amount of food we get for the price we paid.
5
If you want a great shabu shabu / steamboat experience better go here.
Soup base are unlimited we always choose bak kut teh and ginseng.
What I love is the diferrent sauces you can choose and the unlimited drinks.
5
The food is really good. Really enjoyed the hotpot with my family. The service is excellent. The staffs are very helpful and friendly. It is a very pleasant experience.
4
1) Staffs are serviced oriented.
2) love the perks ordering additional meats, vegetables and deep fried fish skin at half price!
3) Overall, had an enjoyable family dining experience.
5
A very authentic selection of broths to team up with fresh steamboat ingredients. The Bak Kut Teh broth comes with a slice of pork rib! Simply fabulous. The herbal broth is one of the greatest. The sauces are free to mix and take.
3
My friend and I just went there last week. We didn't order much but the bill was $70+ after 20% discount for membership. Will not recommend to go there unless you like hot pot very much and don't mind the price. Food so so only, nothing fantastic
4
Our family of 3 had our steamboat dinner at JPot (Tampines 1) recently. The soup base was great, especially the bak kuk teh and superior broth and ingredients are fresh but, I find it slightly expensive. We paid about $160 for 3 persons and that's only with 1 scallop item. The high tea set will probably be more worth it
4
First visit to JPot.Was feeling under the weather the days before and hence I wanted something soupy for dinner. As we were in Tampines, we'd decided to try JPot and we were pleasantly surprised!The ingredients used were fresh, the sauce choices were great - loved the shallots and fried garlic, which is not often offered elsewhere! Broth was amazing and made all the food really good. One thing that's keeping me from going back though, was the price. We didn't order much but still it came up to SGD 35 per pax
5
Highly recommended! Booking was easy. Crew received us with confirmation of our booking. Got a nice area that is private and quiet. Food was excellent as usual.
3
Everything is great and awesome. Quality is up to standard and satisfaction. Could be improved on having more variety choice of food
4
Serving is fast, broth is very good.
Food is fresh and sauces are unique.
But prices are on the high side.
Average spending per pax is about SGD35
4
food was fresh, service good as usual. prices seem to have gone up abit since the last time i was here.
4
Always enjoy ourselves at this place. Love the soup. We come at least once a month. Price is slightly high but worth it.
4
My family truly enjoyed the food. Loved the meat selection. My daughter ate a full belly. Atmosphere was good.
5
First time using chope for reservation but it is really very easy and fast for booking reservation! Love the app! Will continue to use!
5
The food was fresh and service was excellent. Good place for steamboat. Overall experience was very good!
4
I love their premium broth, and usually will order 6-7 ingredients to go with the soup. Ice water is free of charge, but other drinks will require charge.The only downside is that it is ala-carte pricing and hence the total bill can shoot up if you are not conscious of what you order. However, a catch is that if you are a Jumbo Rewards members, you can offset up to 30% of your bill with your Jumbo$.Maybe because of the ingredients I usually order, my average bill is $50 (before Service Charge and GST), but offsetting it with Jumbo$ can reduce my bills by $10+ dollars
3
i know when i've been shortchanged as i have been frequenting JPOT many times very often. The prawns and scallops were minuscule this time. The amount of cabbage had decreased by so much and they forgot to give us our mushrooms (which are supposed to be included in the set) For the amount of money paid, it's truly disappointing. You will be better off frequenting an eat-all-u-can- eat decent buffet with this type of inconsistency. At least u can have value for your money at those places. i hope it is a one-time off bad experience. Only another visit will tell! Although i'm hesitant to waste my money again.
4
Good selection of menu items, quick service but a bit pricey. I love the choice of soup bases and the items were fresh.
4
Table was allocated according to wat I wanted. Seafood is reali fresh and good. Will always come back for more.
4
Their service is good. Food is fresh and the place is clean. They even provide a basket to put our belonging.
5
Awesome, however, hopefully the set menu can have more portion or variety. After all is still good!.
4
Could be better if there were more counter staff to deal with bill payments. It resulted in a long queue.
4
I have brought my family and foreigners to taste the foods and enjoy the ambience.Our opinion is :1. Cater to various type of customers' taste due to soup base.2. Vegetarians can order their choice of vegetables3. The ingredients for the mix of sauce available allows clients to make their sauce base as they like to enhance their taste bud. 4. Foods can be cooked to suit the clients' liking be it well done, raw, medium ect5. Comfortable seating arrangement.
4
Been to JPot many times. As usual you can expect good quality food (not too pricey) and good service. However hate it when they stick two pairs of strangers sitting so close to one another that there is no privacy at all. Instead of the wood panel that slides in or out to separate the tables, maybe it should have a fixture with a partition between. Hate the feeling of some strangers talking loudly next to me or feeling like my partner can't talk about anything private or personal or else we will be eavesdropped
5
Jpot isn't exactly Japanese like what the description says, but that's not important because it is AWESOME! I tried the Jpot superior broth and the porridge broth and I like them both. I usually do not like pig liver, but their liver is well sliced and good to taste when you boil it in your soup! The peanut sauce also taste like dessert and it taste very good with your lean pork slices. This place is great if you are looking at something healthy and light for lunch or dinner. Children and the elderly can eat it too. I love it!
4
Good quality of food, great selection of sauces and being allowed to customise your own sauce is great. Service staff a little harried - this should be improved upon - you guys need more waiters/waitresses! Pricing was appropriate given the quality of food served. Altogether a great experience as usual
5
Love the local soup favor. Food presented is very nice and tasty too. Everything looks clean and appetizing. Service is very good too. It is like a restaurant type of setting and all air-conditioned. I find it value for money as I do remembered i went to one hot pot at bugis but the price, service and food was not valued for money compare to Jpot
4
Nice food! Great service. The only dismay is that there is timing (about 1 hr) restriction to our dining.
4
Good services provided, soup bases porridge one is plain but others are good. They have herbal, laksa, Tom yam, jpot and vegetarian soup choices. Will go again.
4
Soup bases were definitely gd comparing to some other steamboat restaurants...variety n quality of food was gd, including selection of drinks..
5
With the Chope app, making a reservation has never been so easy. Floor staff responses quickly with our food orders through iPad, and they clear our used utensils fast!
5
Great service as usual although serving of food was a little slower as compared to other days. My request of extra seating was met. Thank you
4
The waiters and waitresses are efficient. Food was served fast. Quality of food was fresh and good .

Went down to JPot @ Tampines 1 yesterday with my family.This is the 1st time that we are visiting Jpot whereby it is similar to any other traditional hot pot dining areas in Singapore but the only difference is that each diner will have their own hot pot whereby they can choose any 1 of the 6 soup bases available: JPOT Superior Broth, Bak Kut Teh, Herbal, Laksa, Silky Porridge, Tom Yum and Vegetarian.There are also quite a wide varieties of cooked and raw food ranging from pork, chicken, mutton, beef, live seafood, yong tau fu, vegetables, mushrooms and noodles. Soft drinks and hot drinks are free flow at $3.80 and $1.80 per pax respectively.What I like best is their Sauce Counter whereby there are a huge selection of sauces that you can mix and match according to your own taste OR you can also follow the recommended recipes listed at the counter.The service was fast and the staffs are also very friendly and prompt in topping-up the soup and clearing the used plates. Talk about the soup, this is 1 of the things that I do not like about Jpot is that they used the same soup base for all the soup i.e. Superior Broth. I ordered the Herbal Soup and it tasted fantastic in the initial stage. However, when I requested for a top-up, I was given the "default" soup base and not the Herbal Base. As a result, my pot of soup tasted like plain water with a pinch of salt and soya sauce (very disappointed).The other minus point is the price. It costs me around $120+ for 4 pax and we did not even ordered much food cos the pricing for each dish is quite expensive especially the seafood section (8 prawns = $10.50++).This is one place whereby I will only visit once just to experience the different dining setting
5
I have been to this place for four times and everytime i had fantastic experience. Very different concept for me as an Indian and that too vegetarian. There are number of veggie options and have veg soup base as well. Its worth spending and that too not a costly place to dine
5
Very fresh steamboat ingredients - pricier than many steamboat shops but you can be assured of the quality.1) Recommended soup base - Herbal; Bak Kut Teh and Vegetarian2) Recommended ingredients - Jumbo pork ball, fish slices, prawns, marinated pork and chicken3) Recommended cooked ingredients - fried bean sticks, fried fish skin and fried wanton4) Recommended drink : LuoHanGuo/ Barley drinkJpot also has a huge spread of condiments and sauces, and yummy fried garlic, sesame and peanuts for you to choose from.
4
JPot is located at 10 Tampines Central 1 #03-16, Tampines 1, Singapore 529536.The nearest MRT statiion is at Tampines.This is another traditional Singapore hot pot dinning place. The different is each diner will order their own preference of soup base for the food. There are 9 types of soup broth to choose from: spicy, non-spicy, vegetarian etc ...For the food, you could pick from under :Dim Sum section, the meat which includes pork, chicken, mutton and beef; the Live Seafood and normal seafood, the Yonf Tau Fu Section, the Vegetables, Beancurd section, the Mushrooms and Noodles Section ... There are desserts and soft drinks to go along with the meals and soft drinks are free flow.The best at JPot is their Sauce Counter : you will be lost for choice of sauces to pick from, or you would like to mixed the sauces together and create your own taste.You could order steamed rice or noodles to go along with the food.The food were freshly served and you could dropped them into the soup broth to cook. The service at JPot is also fast and staff are friendly.During peak hours, it is always full house, unless you have make a reservation beforehand. The pricing for each dish is quite high too, especially the seafood section.This is one of my favorite dinning place as you could opt for different food each visit.May 201
3
Food is ok. Price abit expensive.
Service is warm.
The soup choices were good especially the herbal one. But later the soup top up made it very blend.
4
Not my first time here so overall experience was always good. It was my boyfriend birthday and with the help of the staff, I managed to surprise him with the cupcakes I ordered externally. Food was always good because of the superior broth soup base.
5
This online booking is easy to use, fast and trustworthy. I would recommend everyone to use online booking more often.
4
Well is okay but the problem r chair to low for person sitting on wheelchair..or sitting wheelchair table to high...
5
Manager,Serice Staff, Supersvion,Counter Staff, and up ALL Staff are very Good Friendly IN Singapore.Only Tampines Jpot.Thanks
4
Average value, good service, very good atmosphere, good food,Average value, good service, very good atmosphere, good food
4
It is what you can expect of a steamboat place, but you have your own pot. Although this is not a new concept, but the food served here is fresh and the setup is well thought out.The only thing is that we have to finish the meal within a certain time, although this was highlighted to us when we we seated, it was quite a rush in the last ten mins..
4
I've been to all the 3 branches and Tampines outlet is the only branch with big round pots to share for big group of 7 pax and above. The rest of the outlets only have individual pots and kids below 10 years old are allowed to share with an adult. By having big pots, we do get to save abit. Comparing Tampines and Parkway branches, Tampines seems to have more service staff and staff are more attentive. Highlights of the dinner are mainly the sauces which we can mix on our own as well as the crispy fried fish skin
3
Went there for lunch with the family and it was not bad. You get a personal pot of broth, which you can choose from their signature, herbal or tom yum soups. You can order ala carte, but the sets are a better choice and are based according to price/number of people. We went for the 4 person set for S$88 (before taxes), and it was quite substantial. It came with a choice of pho noodles or rice, a selection of seafood such as prawns, fishballs and fishcakes, vegetables and chicken, beef or pork.There is a side table where you can select and mix your sauces such as chilli, sesame oil, chopped nuts and scallions, among others. You can also help yourself to water at another station.Service was quite fast
3
Good place for get-together though I won't say the variety of the food is good coz most of what we want to order, it's out of stock. Overall, the prices was abit ex.. depending on what you ordered. I would not really want to go back unless it's for a group gatherin
4
The hotpot is quite nice. I enjoy mixing the sauce. The customer service is okay. However, sometime I wonder how clean the food is!
4
Been there a few times, love soup so much & the food is very fresh. A bit costly but worthy. Individual pot, can choose your own favour.
4
The seating style of the restaurant is more suited for friends gatherinf and couples date, with each diner having his own hotpot.
5
It's my 4th time at Jpot and I really loved the food, service and atmosphere there. Their online booking reservation is very user friendly. I can make reservations and amend easily.
3
Good taste for the sea food and beef.
But so expensive, 3 persons cost 270S$, about 90 S$/person.
Time limitation is so disappointed to us with so much cost.
5
Been here countless time. Fresh food, good soup base, friendly staff.....will definitely be back again and to infinity and beyond.
3
Food is nice and fresh but choose is too little. If possible to have choose of 2 flavor of soup base for each person will be great.
4
I ordered the 88++ set dinner for 2 persons. The seafood platter was quite fresh, and the bean curd was delicious. Highly recommend its duck with salted veg soup base, the JPOT soup base was not as good as expected. Service was fast and effective.
4
The food was awesome! Vegetables and meat varieties were abundant and plentiful. The thin slices of melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu beef is a must try. One thing I like about JPot is the DIY sauce. I can concoct my own chilli sauce for my meat. Though some hotpot restaurants also have DIY sauce, the ingredients are pathetic compared to JPot. Another good thing about JPot is that everyone will get his/her own pot of broth and there are i think 6-8 types to choose from. With your own pot, you do not need to stretch every time you need to dip your favorite food into the pot to cook it. There are a few branches in Singapore, and I have tried 2(Tampines One and Vivo) and both were great. To me, it is a tiny bit on the expensive side. For 2 persons, it can easily go above S$80
5
Our favourite steamboat place for good reasons. 1. Individual pot of soup which is hygienic & convenient for one to cook and eat. 2. Customisable dip to go with food with aplenty condiments. 3. Variety of fresh food which is ala carte style, order what you need. 4. Variety of soup bases to choose from which are yummy. 5. Good service & ambience which is better than buffet style establishment. 6. Occasional Groupon promotion which defray the costs. Thumbs-up
4
Loved the wide range of condiments and the very tasty soup bases! Thank you for a great dining experience
5
this is not a japanese restaurant.. o think trip advisor put it wrong category for it. this is steamboat chinese style. there are so many soup base u can choose...the sauce is also really nice. die die must try if u came to singapore
5
JPot has been my favourite place to have steamboat since a year ago. Will continue to go back there.
5
We had a $54 seafood lunch set for 2 and added on some ala-carte items ie. beancurd skin and fried tofu only. was more than enough for us 3 girls! Great value for $. only going for weekday lunch in future!
5
Very nice food! Food was fresh and the soup base is very delicious. Good customer service. will come back again!
5
With a great spread of food added with great attentive service from the staff, I'm really happy to have celebrated my birthday with Jpot!
4
- Individual pot (variety of soup base to choose from)
- Fresh ingredient
- Must order (fish/meat paste)
- Good to have additional sauce bowl
- Slightly on higher cost
4
We enjoyed the food at Vivo JPot, the ingredients are really fresh. But the restaurant always fully booked, must be booked in advance.
4
A place where we frequent..quality of food is good..jus that some dishes run out pretty fast like the baby bayam..
5
Was here for lunch with my son & sister. Like the atmosphere & it's an ideal place for piping hot steamboat with aircon.Impressed with their selection of sauces & condiments. Very fresh. I had their fish head soup base, thick & creamy. Shows the stock base have been boiled for long hours. We ordered prawn ball which is fresh n bouncy, the marinated pork was tender & tasty. Do try it. It's good. Next, we try the gigantic meat ball, it's really good. The crispy beancurd was delicious after soaking in the stock. We love it. Vegetables are fresh. Tips from the staff, told us to buy the coupon from deal. Very good deal for delicious & healthy steamboat. Highly recommend, will definitely go agai
4
Food was fresh and good. Many sauces to choose. Free flow of drinks for $3.50 per pax.
Set lunch will have better value.
Service was slow and staff was not so friendly.
5
My favorite ala carte steamboat joint, people I have introduced to JPot have praises for it too. Fresh food with unique soup bases. Bak kut teh is my favorite soup base. Love the fried tofu with seaweed toppings.
5
fresh ingredients. wide selection of ingredients. good price. superb soup base. nice ambient and seating. efficient service. great D.I.Y. dipping sauce.
4
Jpot offered a great variety of soup base, regardless of whether you want a strong tasting one or just a clear soup. The ingredients are very fresh and not too expensive. impressed by the options of sauces and condiments. Make your own pick at the sauce counter.
4
I love this place. it is always a good place to get a steamboat fix. the prices are affordable and the soup bases is incredibly delicious. it's a pity they no longer have the sharing pot and now insists that each individual has their own soup. quite silly if both of us only wants one kind of soup base. ingredients are always fresh and of good quality and portions. should you (if ever) face with an unfresh portion of orders, they are always happy to change it for you or cancel it off your bill. no questions asked. DIY dipping sauce bar at no extra charge and cost. always a place for an awesome steamboat fix
5
This is simply the best value steamboat joint in Singapore. Sure, it's pricier than other places but the quality of the food is way better than any others I have eaten at. The set price alternatives make ordering very simple and easy (using the iPad provided fixed to the side of the table), and the food all arrives very swiftly. The mid priced set we had included beef strip loin and marinated chicken plus scallops, dumplings and fish balls, and lots of fresh greens and different kinds of mushroom. All the different stocks available are tasty and comforting, and the sauce bar is really first class.Will keep coming back whenever I'm in the mood

Bot groupon voucher. Took a frenz there for birthday celebration.Online booking of table was fast and easy. Service was good, bring us to the table and explain how to order using the ipad i assumed, embedded onto the table drawer. Ordering of food was simple and easy for me. Should be easy for those who is users of ipad. Food items are well organised with chef recommendations in one page followed by different category of food in other pages. The amount $ was stated clearly on the page. It even adds up the total amount so you know exactly how much you have ordered. My voucher is worth $50, so I know exactly the point where I have reach the amount. That is very good. I like the system.Each of us could order a soup base. We tried the laksa and the bak ku teh, nice.With $3.80, can have free flow of home make drinks and soft drinks.Place is quiet and nice for a nice lunch. Overall i like the place
4
We went to the Tampines outlet for lunch on a weekday. Even though it was a weekday lunch hour, you could still see quite a number of tables occupied.Being our first visit to Jpot, the staff showed us what needed to be done in order to order the food. Thought that the idea of keying in your order on the i-pad was an interesting experience plus a productivity booster for the outlet.Though this is our first time at Jpot, we love the variety of food for the steamboat and will not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to those who love steamboat. Hubby normally likes bak kut teh (pig bone soup) but surprisingly over here, he preferred the herbal chicken soup base... :
4
We had booked a table for 9 persons for gathering and group birthday celebration, a few of us reached the restaurant first and was led into the restaurant by the staffs, they were very courteous, one of the waitresses was very patient when we kept on disturbing her while she was preparing our tables, and she even gave advice to us to order a 4 person set steamboat and then if not enough then some ala carte dishes. And she had made a good recommendation, the 4pax set was quite a lot and we only need to order some more dishes to fulfill 9 pax portion. Food wise, the soup base varieties was quite good, they have bak kut teh, Jpot special broth, tom yam, vegetarian soup, Laksa etc, the taste of the soup is so so only, but the food are quite fresh, sauce for dipping also nice, you can choose and mix yourself. Other than that not much to say about the taste. We kept on chitchatting during our meal and stayed until quite late, in fact we were the second last table to leave, yet the staffs did not show any sign of impatience. This place is great for big group gathering as there were so many people in the restaurant(but the place is big) and noisy and even if you joke and laugh nobody will bother about you. We had lots of fun that night. Price wise, is reasonable, each of us paid around S$30, but also depend on what you order. Anyway, the experience is not bad, quite enjoyable. Will be back again
4
went to another steamboat at liang court week before my visit to jpot. Cant stop myself from comparing both. i would say Jpot definitely the better one. The soup base, the food and also the price. I am never a steamboat go-er, but i dont mind going to Jpot again. You can order place your order via ipad, everything will be served fast. and You will be able to choose your own soup base, as you will have a little pot for your own. I tried the laksa, it is nice
