2nd time here, and the food is still good. Tried the large plate of chicken this time, along with the dumplings and noodles.

Overall the food is good, though did not like the pepper crab too much. The place serves good shaanxi cuisine which is on the spicier side.

We went here for lunch. The food was very good and the location along the river was very nice. Service was quick and polite.

Visited here with parents a couple of times for lunch.Great riverside location and whilst Boat Quay is an area that attracts a lot of tourists, this is a pretty down-to-earth place without the hard sell - reasonably priced food, and possibly the cheapest beer in the city centre - $2.90 mug, $14 jug (1.2 litres).Would recommend.

We stopped here as it was the only restaurant along Boat Quay that didnâ€™t do a hard sell as we walked by, and it was full of Chinese customers which seemed a good sign. Quite spicy northern Chinese food, decent quality and a very reasonable price given the location overlooking the water and service was friendly. Would happily visit again

Situated next to the Singapore River, in a prime area among other F&B establishments, is this unassuming Chinese eatery. Fact that the menu is predominantly in Chinese words does restrict the clientele, unless your friendly Asian colleague offers to bring you there. However the menu does have some pictorial recommendations of the more popular dishes. First time there, and we had the classic Dan Dan Noodles, and shared a plate of the deep fried dumplings (Guo Tie), both were quite delicious. Noodles were already mildly spicy, and there is an option of adding more chili, with the jars of chili available by each table. Final bill was $18 nett, which works out to $9 per pax, a very affordable price tag along this popular stretch. #WorthI

It is surprising to find a niche Northwest Chinese style noodle shop at Boat Quay. The meal is served in a container usually seen in a buffet restaurant. The ingredients are stewed chicken, potatoes and onions with a mild spicy flavour. The noodle, finger wide and thick, is added later to the stew. A simple yet delicious dish worthy a try

Happened upon this place and loved the la mian! Sauces are slightly oily.Portions are well sized and great value.The spiciness level was very good although a bit challenging in Singapore heat at times.Seating wise is a bit of a pain - typical Chinese style where you have a meal and eavesdrop on your neighbours conversations

If you love Chinese food ,especially from north of China , you will love this restaurant. The look, the feel, the service and very important the food were very much like you would find in Xian. To be clear this is not 5 star restaurant! Not 4 either... Some of the folks in our group were speaking Chinese and that helped, as staff had limited English skills. Good thing, the menu has pictures. Portions are large, better suited for sharing in a larger group. One interesting observation, was that this restaurant was full while other area restaurants were mostly empty. Also most of the customers were Chinese , or at least speaking Chinese ....We had a great dinner and we will definitely return when in the area. Strong recommendation !

Ordered the pepper crab (at $90) and frankly, probably the worst crab I've had in the US or Singapore - yes, we were ripped off. Very limited English or service. What a way to start our visit in Singapore. We visited around 2:30 and they demanded payment before they served the crab. They quickly backed down when I told them to return the crab. Apparently they were trying to close down at mid afternoon but happily took our order. The waiter had a severe bi-lateral eye infection and I couldn't believe my wife tried to consume the meal...I had a single claw and the meat had no consistency, was dry and tasteless. The bottled beer was fine however...what a colossal waste of time and money

The price is considered cheap within Boat Quay region. Variety choices of China cuisine and taste good. View is also nice if you can get the table with river view.

must try the chilly noodles there. The prawns were to die for . Big jumbo prawns. Excellent veg food as well. Had some yum coconut water. Reach early as these restaurants shut by 11 PM.

It will be pleasantly pleased with the quality of food served here. Authentic and delicious.
Their menu have items that are not easily found in other Chinese restaurants in Singapore! Portions are big and of good value. Recommend the "pulled noodles".

In a beautiful location overlooking Clarke Quay, this serves authentic (and very tasty) Chinese, particularly Xian, cuisine. Definitely worth a visit!!

Although it is a small restaurant and looks a bit cheap, the meals can be highly recommended. Especially food with "spicy" in the name are made in very delicious ways (hot and garlic). The food is way more than the pictures show - only order one course per person maximum.We had little misunderstandings regarding water (hot instead of sparkling ) and one of the main courses (beef instead of seafood), but they quickly replaced it.The prices are ok facing the amount you get

Located at 56 Boat Quay, go and grab a table at this chinese restaurant and there will be 1 woman out of the 20-30 staff who can reply to you in English. An elaborated menu with numbers and pictures for respective dishes makes life simpler before you could order. Point out to the steward what you want and thats it..We had ordered Sliced Pork with spicy sauce & spicy minced pork...Well the quantity was so much that I couldnt finish it. I recommend that 2 people can share a bowl of noodles / sliced pork and you will be happy that you dont get sleepy in the afternoon at work. Filled with corporates around, the restaurant promised you a very fast service. You may try this restaurant if you are looking for chinese cuisine.

Quick summary below. I know this type of food very well and I will guarantee that all those who praise this restaurant in their reviews have no idea. Or alternatively when I went there, the chef was sick, but this is not my problem.+ Great Chinese food theme, in theory (but needs good execution)+ Good location on boat quay- Xinjiang chicken. This was the best dish we had. Yet it was poor, chicken all pre cooked and dry, strong soy based sauce.- Terrible YouPoMian. Bad oil taste, no chili, had nothing to do with the original dish. And taste was horrible.- Green vegetable, overly oily, super salty. Yes chinese food can be salty. But this was too much for any Chinese too.- Hot inside. Aircon not working- Dodgy interiors. Dirty. Feels like eating in the street in Thailand (at a very different price)In summary: forget it. Any food court will do better. Guarantee

This authenic Chinese restaurant is at 56 Boat Quay on the Sinpapore River. We were the the only western people in this establishment. The rest were locals. During the week days it is open fron 11:30am to 3:30pm and on the Saturday for both lunch and dinner. Sunday is from 5:30pm to 10pm. The service and food is second to none. All dishes served were as described in both Mandarin and English. The Peking Duck is served and carved at the table and as a bonus the remaining bone and meat is served as a soup. As in all Singapore restaurants the drinks area bit expensive compared to Australia (local tax). There was 5 in our party including a child who was especially catered for. Total with beer and cocktail S$170. Excellent value and wonderful food

It was a nice experience to sit outside at the riverside Boat Quay in the evening at our arrival in Singapore. From the terrace we enjoyed the beautiful view on Singapore and the light show of Marina Bay Sands. The food was excellent; all dishes we ordered were very well spiced. Service was good. Prices at Boat Quay are relatively high compared to other Singapore restaurants, but the location is fantasti

This place serves excellent Xian style Chinese food. Not being from Xian or even Chinese myself, I can't say I am an authority on this cuisine, but I went with friends from Xian who assured me that this is the best Xian there is to be had in Singapore.The Spring Chicken Noodle, the small is a huge platter, is a must have. The handmade, thick fat noodles are delish! Another must-have are the cold noodles (not cumin noodle) - divine. The spicy noodle is really spicy (and I am an Indian who loves her spice). Chive pancake is another good choice. (It's like a onion and chive stuffed paranta/prata). Advise to avoid all Sichuan items here, and concentrate on the Xian items. The food here uses a kind of peppercorn (called Mala?) which numbs the tongue, so don't freak out if suddenly you can't feel anything your tongue, the feeling passes away after 1/2 an hour.A few local Singaporean tips for you to know. Boat Quay is an overpriced "tourist" location. Knowing that you are a visitor is going to get the shop owners here to hard sell you all the expensive items and make you order way too many things. Another BIG trick is that most westerners prefer to sit "outside" next to the river, so there is a price difference between sitting "outside" and sitting "inside". Once you are aware of these subtleties, eating at this place is enjoyable
