Been here five or six times and the pizzas are consistently good,the pasta looked average.
It’s in a good location and has a pleasant atmosphere.
Service was slow and a bit disinterested.
Would still go back
4
Place offers decent Italian food - tried home made pasta and pizzas. All food was fresh and well preapared.
4
Consistently good food through the years, good service from Helmi... although facilities could have been better maintained.
Can't go wrong with the cold cut platter & pizza choices, although pairing of salad ingredients could've been improved.
5
This place served great pizza, enough to share however was so good wanted my own! - already got next visit to this place sorted.
4
The place very cosy on Tuesday nite. Not so many people as it was on my first visit there on the Friday night. Service was good.
5
Went there for lunch with my two sons. Enjoyed ourselves. The service was very thoughtful and attentive. We each ordered the pizza although there were folks having pasta.
The pizzas were very well done, sizeable and Super yummy.
Would highly recommend the Pizza Bar!

Went there to celebrate my mum’s birthday recently. Granted, we dodo t make any reservation but the wait staff seems very indifferent to us. There were obviously plenty of table around and they put us at some small corner next to the wine shelf and toilet. Truth be told, when we left, there were heaps of table available for a party of four. The place doesn’t provide any air conditioning nor fan. We “suffered” through the heat and humidity of palmy Singapore with barely any air circulation. (Should have taken a table outside)Wont be back again for sure.

We have eaten or or had takeaway from Da Paolo on many occasions while visiting family here in Singapore. the pizzas have always been freshly made and baked crispy, with good generous toppings. They will make a good range of standard pizzas and will vary ingredients to taste. Their accompanying salads have always been fresh tasty and dressed with good olive oil. Service has always been brisk efficient and friendly, and prices are reasonable for Singapore.A very good restaurant when only a pizza will do
4
I have eaten here several times. Service has been prompt. The salads and pizza are great. The pastas have been less predictable with respect to quality, ranging from excellent to just OK. Desserts are overpriced at $15 each. Great value for money is the 3 course lunch that costs around $25. Ambience is good. Definitely worth trying.
3
It has good food and good ambience but price is slightly steep. We asked the staffs to serve the birthday cake for my friend and they didn't inform us that there will be extra charges. In the end, they charged us $30 just to open the box of the cake and to serve to the table
5
Super friendly staff. Great pizza (white or red...) which goes great with good wine and friends to enjoy it all.
5
Fantastic tuna salad followed by pizzas - the Parma Ruccola recommended by the waiter exceeded expectations. Peronis at exactly the right temperature.
4
Good setting for big groups. Food came fairly quickly. Will deft patronise again. Not sure why I need to type Min 100 characters though!
4
We went there with some colleagues for lunch. Pizza of course! What I always liked about this place, is that there is plenty of choice to eat outside and it's really comfy there. I really like that. We all had pizza and although they were good, they were not like they used to be when I last visited them a while ago. We have been here many times already and I'm not sure what happened, but something changed. Mind you that you cannot go there for a lunch if you only have a one hour lunch break because we had to wait for 45min for our pizzas and we were one of the first tables in the place that noon. So when we complained that it took so long, the waiters just shrugged and said it would come soon. Anyway, OK food but the long waiting time and waiters not being very attentive, I give it a somewhat lower score this time.
1
Shocked. Have been patrionizing this place for years and have always been provided shaved Parmesan with the pizza. Asked this time and was told it was chargeable. Regulars at all other pizza places in Singapore - and not talking about the fast food variety - and have never been charged. Considering we ordered 2 pizzas in excess of $30 a piece, really disappointing at how myopic they are. Time to just go elsewhere. No shortage of pizza restaurants and lots of which have better food and service

Went for dinner and drinks on a weekday evening. Arrived 10 minutes earlier than their opening time but was welcomed by a friendly staff.It is a nice restaurant with outdoor tables next to landed property and a quiet road. My Friend and I enjoyed the al fresco dinner and the serene environment very much.We had Rucola e Crudo pizza (wild rocket, Parma ham, mozzarella &a sheared Parmesan), which was not bad. The thin crust is still crispy even after 30 minutes.Happy hour starts from 530-730pm and beer and house pour wine are 1 for 1. The draught peroni was chilled and smooth. The Cabernet Shiraz was not bad too, though it would have been better if there are more choices by glass.Overall 3.5* and I will be back to enjoy a quiet evening under the sky
1
I have been to this place a few times in the past and I always likes the ambience and the pizzas. But this time it was just disappointing in any way: even there have been just a few tables taken the service was very slow. We ordered two starter and two main dishes. The main of my partner was already there but mine was not coming even after we asked 2 times for it. The pizza arrived almost 15 minutes later without any excuses. The pizza itself offered 3 tiny pieces of chicken for 28 S$, by far over priced even for Singapore
5
First, the bar is very accessible (within walking distance) from the train station. Second, the services provided are impeccable. From the time they remember your orders and request for a proper table, prompt and efficient. Third, the food is consistently yummy and at affordable price range. Fourth, the ambience is very cosy. It is so easy to wind down after a long tiring day. Do we still need a fifth reason? ;) P/s, my favourite pizza is available here, Fiorentine (salami, spinach and eggs).
4
Came here with friends for dinner.Actually we're not that hungry. So we decided to order 2 pizza and chicken wings for a starter.The chicken wings is not so bad, but it just lacks of flavour. You must dip it into the sauce to eat it.As for the pizza, I love the quatro cheese which is made of four types of cheese. The other one comes with parma ham and rocket leafes also quite good.Within the second slices, I already felt full.The ambiance is good, though it's a bit hot. I think they need to service their aircon
2
Visited at Da Paolo Pizza Bar on 26 August with a friend who stays in Holland Village. We ordered the Al Granchio and Diavola. The Al Granchio was great but the Diavola was really, really salty. We had to ask for refills of drinks. We commented this to one of the server and his response is "Salami is supposed to be salty". We told him we know that salami is salty but my friend, who stays around the vicinity frequents the restaurant a few times find the pizza extra salty than most days. Instead of accepting the customer's comments, the waiter's odd comment is "Your taste buds have changed". Looks like Da Paolo is treating their customers like idiots! What a pity, the location is good and the ambience is nice but other than that, nothing much to rave about. You can find better places elsewhere
4
Been patronizing this place dos years. The quality of food and the taste has remained consistent through the years. This is where I get my comfort food. A place you can count on
4
Staff were friendly and accommodating.
Ingredients used for pizza tasted fresh and we especially like the crispy crust.
Will be back!
4
Ordered ham pizza and lasagne and both were very good, flavourful and not too salty. Service was very good as well, with sufficient attention and responsive to requests.
4
This is a nice place to chat with friends and eat. This place has many varieties in Italian cuisine,and I especially loved the spaghetti. It is a must try place in Singapore.
4
I'm Italian....as an expatriate, sometimes I need to get a good pizza. My friend brought me to this restaurant and I got what I need. The place is nice, quiet and good to enjoy a good pizza in a very relaxing place. Very good service. It's one of my place in Singapore
4
I had a really great time here, the food and service was of great quality and the ambiance was fitting. The food was extremely delicious. They had a really great choice for vegetarians which was amazing for me. The Pasta, pizza and salads were fresh and well served. Service was great. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it!! It's a great place to hangout with friends or even to spend time with family.
5
I have probably been to da paolo abt 10 times as it is walking distance from.our place. Usually go on sunday afternoons or week evenings. I always order the caliprawnia or black tuna salad. I love the salads Fresh and tasty and huge portion. My husband always gets a pizza and as a big pizza love he is never dissapointed. Service is as service is in Singapore so dont expect to be blown away by excellent service but other than that its a great place for a casual and relaxing meal!
4
Our first visit to this restaurant in the upper reaches of Chip Bee Gardens in Holland Village. Incidentally, there are other Da Paolo outlets, such as Gastronomia, on the same street. As the evening was pleasant after rain showers, we chose alfresco seating. No problem getting a seat when we arrived at 7.15, but the restaurant was full by the time we left at 8.30. Not sure if they take reservations, probably not. Despite it being a "pizza bar", we chose pasta dishes which were entirely satisfactory if a bit pricey. Service was friendly, but the food did take quite a while to come; we noticed that pizzas were served faster. A pleasant evening with nice ambience. Parking available nearby, though it may be hard to find a space on weekends. Would visit again for special occasions

Ate here with a friend for a casual lunch - haven't been here for quite a few months and was very disappointed. We ordered the bruschetta, - the tomato topping looked old and certainly didn't taste fresh: the caprese salad was ok however the lettuce leaves weren't crisp and fresh and many of the leaves were off - not sure where the basil was: truffle fries tasted stale, were dry and had no real taste. Sad to say we left most of our meal on the table and won't be rushing back
1
Just posted a Yelp review about this place but figured more people in Asia look at trip advisor. Ordered the spinach chicken salad and meatballs. The salad had way too much balsamic and wasn't dressed, the chicken tasted like it was frozen and then the meatballs ........ Tomato sauce out of a can for sure ..... I don't know how else you mess this up. Overall ambiance and service was good but for 80$ (2 half full glasses of wine included) I highly discourage anybody going. I live in the neighborhood so rather restaurants with good food quality be around the corner .
4
We love the pizza and ambience of this venue, however, the service is always terrible. Strongly suggest placing your order when the waiter seats you to avoid a lengthy wait to try and grab the attention of staff.
3
reasonably good italian restaurant/pizzaria! nice setting!good atmosphere! tasty food(pastas)! and good service! don't mind going back! open long hours=positive!
5
Had 1 pasta a and 1 pizza to share.
Pizza took a slightly longer time to be served but it was so good that it made the wait worth it!
Good value as we used the Entertainer 1-1 app too!
5
The truffle fries were divine, I loved the pizzas and also the salads. Highly recommend the place for a nice, not overly priced meal. The helpings are hearty and large so be prepared :)
4
This place was a regular for our family as the food is very good, service efficient, and great ambiance. But it is expensive - 2 pizzas and 4 non-alcoholic drinks will set you back around $95.
1
We ordered a Warm Goat Cheese Salad, Pasta Aglio e Olio and a Pizza at the Holland Village branch on a Sunday evening. After 10 minutes we got 2 of our main dishes - the salad and the pasta. The salad was described to be served with warm goat cheese, however, the cheese was cold! So it was not quite worth the $25+ we paid for it. After finishing these to dishes and waiting for another 15 minutes (so total waiting about 30 minutes) we asked, whether the remaining pizza is supposed to be delivered. We were told by the service staff, that the Pizza is in the oven and will be on the table within 3 minutes. Waiting another 15 minutes (so total waiting time adds up to 45 minutes) - the Pizza was still not there. At that point of time we decided to leave the restaurant. In pricy places like this, you would have expected a notice while ordering, if it takes longer then usual. A waiting time of about 60 minutes for a Pizza - come on, that is not what you expect in a place that is called "Pizza Bar". So we can't comment on the quality of the Pizza as this was not served to us. There are much better places for Pizza and Pasta in Singapore
1
I went to pizza twice this week. When I was enjoying the place for many years, it seems they adopt a new strategy serving frozen dough. Pizza is sloggy and didn't enjoy anymore. A pity as place remains busy but for how Long??? Get back our neighbourhood pizza bar
4
The restaurant located a little bit away from MRT but the services there was great from every people who works there. Food tatse is very nice but I was a little bit appointed by cake of the day as it was only fine comparing with food
2
Dinner out with the family but every step of this meal took way too long. OK it was CNY but if you can't get enough staff then don't open.Started with a phone call to book - was told we don't need to book but that a good table would be saved. We arrived to be told "we don't take bookings" after which I said that they did and I had. Luckily there were tables available so no need to panic. Next was the wait for ordering a drink - time passed and I grew older. Eventually orders for dinner and drinks were taken. What happened next was a miracle of biblical proportions as our starters arrived quickly (still no drinks but I was able to hydrate from the tomato sauce that came with the meatballs). Drinks and pasta for 2 out of our party of 5 came soon after. After the pasta was as good as finished the remaining 3x pizzas arrived. Manna from heaven because I was frankly starving.Kids then played for a while and then I asked for the bill. More time passed. Eventually was was able to pay - 263 bucks. Man this place is not cheap. When I mentioned service was not great I was given some excuse about only 4 servers being on and could I be more specific for the "boss". My reply "drinks took too long, food took too long, check took too long and my kids need to go to bed". Can't blame the waitresses if the management doesn't put enough staff on during a holiday.Will we go back. Doubt it.Oh - and the food. Actually one of the best pizzas I have had in a while. What a shame
5
One of the best meal I have ever had. Thin crusted pizza with great toppings. Tasty and tender lasagna. Excellent dessert. Thank God nowadays there is a train station nearby this restaurant. In the past you need to walk quite a distance to reach this place. I keep coming back every time I want to enjoy a good quality pizza. Highly recommended if you appreciate great pizza and dessert.I truly recommend the isola verde pizza. I was a bit skeptical about this pizza at the beginning because I am a meat lover and I don't really enjoy vegetables. But when I tasted this pizza, it was unforgettable....great experience for your taste buds
5
Good pizza in Singapore used to be impossible to find, and Da Paolos was one of the first to deliver a great product at a reasonable price. Great for families too with supplied paper and crayons.
4
Likely one of the best pizzerias in the Holland Village area. Early in the night there is a happy hour two-for-one promotion and the place can fill with expats and screaming kids. But again food is excellent and the place is always full.
4
I really like this part of town and this is an easy pizza place to go to, the pizza is always good and the service is fast.
3
Came here on a whim for dinner. Ordered chicken wings and chicken/avocado pizza. The wings were undercooked inside. The avocado was unripe. All symptoms of a sloppy or distracted chef/kitchen staff. Will avoid in future
4
We went there a Sunday night and even though it was kind of full, we got a table after 10 minutes. However we waited around 45 minutes for the food and the restaurant is not that big so the wait felt a little too long. However the pizzas were really good and fresh! But one pizza cost around 30 SGD which is expensive for a pizza... The restaurant had unique topping alternatives like salmon and also pizzas without tomato-sauce.
4
A very Italian bistro vibe at this trendy pizza and Italian restaurant from the Gastronomia chain of restaurants. A good place for weekday evenings and weekends, ideal for a casual bite to eat with your loved one or dinner with friends. Also very kid friendly so if you are there early evening you'll see people eating with small children whilst you are enjoying the excellent happy hour wines.Pizzas are good and they also have some (a few) options beyond pizza that are good too.The restaurant is open fully along the front so whilst there's a terrace even if you are sitting inside you feel like you are outside. Lovely at night when the air is clear but not ideal if you want to get away from the haze
3
Sometimes I get a serious craving for pizza which won't go away until I get a fresh pie. I've tried most of the pizza delivery companies and there is none that I have recorded from after the first time. My favorite place is a local joint called the Da Paolo Pizza Bar for two reasons: they have a decent take away menu; they have decent, authentic tasting Italian pizza (albeit for Singapore) and great salads. I usually call in my order and by the time I get their it's ready. My favorite is their four seasons pizza and the arugula with goat cheese salad. (Note the Hot Tip #2, below if you're ordering a salad, too.)Hot tip: #1 If you want to avoid the same old, same old try ordering their pizza of the day. #2a if you order salad remind them NOT to stack the salad on top of the hot pizza box.#2b If they forget and the bottom of the salad box is hot, request that they make you new salad. Bon appetit!
5
Da Paolo is situated on a tree lined road a couple of minutes walk from the heart of Holland Village. What is so pleasant about it is the restaurant 'half in, half out' dining that spills out onto the pavement and external dining area. Chunky tables in heavy wood, it is family and child friendly, but at the same time a place you can go to as a couple as evening settles in with subdued lighting. Great pizzas and selection of wines (at typical Singapore prices), and desserts for two (oversized for my liking)
4
Excellent pizza's, some of the best in Singapore probably. Nice atmosphere as well and easily accessible. Good service too. The only negative is that if you go there one evening before say 8:30pm, it's full of couples with kids who couldn't care less they're in a restaurant. That means shouting, climbing on tables, standing on chairs, and playing around like they're in a big garden or something. This was at many tables, so I guess it's something people know where to go if you want a place where your kids can roam around and bother the other guests. So you can avoid that by going a bit later in the evenings. Otherwise one of the best pizzerias in town. We've been many times already and we'll keep going, but not too early though
5
We turned up without a reservation on Mother's Day, and managed to quickly get a table for 5. Perhaps a tip is to leave your visit till the rush is over - 2pm for us. The food was very good as always. Service....usual standard, but fine. Enjo
4
A nice al fresco atmosphere. Casual restaurant to relax with friends. I liked the simply grilled chicken as well as the fresh mango with icecream. Excellent wine though expensive.
5
We had a lovely dinner in this beautiful Italian restaurant. We loved the pasta and the tartare, the wines were excellent and the dessert was one of the best we have tried. The service was also good. We will be back.
2
The pizzas are very good.
The service - especially by the manager - is biased, rude and racist.
The local manager loves white skin so much that he snubs and abuses locals.
I will NEVER go there again.
3
Whe wemt there for a coold Italian dinner. We had to wait over one hour to get some of our orders. The exuise: "we had too many take out"...where is the Manager...Tried to find him to no avail.
3
Weird place. As I asked for a table I was informed by the hostess that the pizzas would take 20-25 minutes, which I thought was quite okay. We sat down and were informed that the pizzas may take 45 to 50 minutes or maybe even longer. Surprising because the restaurant wasn't even full! Nevertheless we stayed there for dinner, ordered a ton of appetizers along with our pizza order, thinking that the pizzas would take long. Surprise, surprise.....the pizzas arrived even before some of the appetizers. Still not clear what was going on with the guys. Food was just average. It's a semi outdoor place and sit in the covered area if you want to feel cooler
2
Cute semi outdoor place, nice for a long weekend lunch. Pizza is more like a cheese on toast, very dry with hardly any tomato paste. The cheese tastes synthetic. Service is very biased with makes the manager totally comical. They obviously haven't read their own reviews; all the customers notice .... Gourmet it certainly is not!
4
Our daughter and her family have been living in Singapore for nearly 10 years and this is their favourite pizza place. We have been with them about 3 times and never been disappointed. The calamari was worth the exoense, pizzas plentiful and staff attentive.... altho .5 ltr does not equal 1 pint
4
A little disappointed with the Calamari Starter but Olives and happy hour made up with that. The pizza was nice, a nice thin almost crispy base with a generous topping. It was around $25 for a pizza so probably not bad atmosphere was good and a good mix of people from family to couples
3
Biased and unfair service. I asked for a table for 2pax at 715pm but we were told to wait for 15 min as the restaurant was full. Guess what? 5 mins later, a Western couple arrived, asked for a table and was shown to it immediately. I understand very well that Pizza Bar has no reservation services which meant that the waitress had attended to the Western couple even though they came after us. We were furious that a good restaurant of Da Paolo Group could provide service based on the colour of one's skin! When we raised this issue up, the waitress was not sincere in her apology and quickly scrambled to settle a paying customer in order to usher us to their table which had not even been cleaned.Food arrived quickly (10-15 min) but service remained poor overall. I noticed that their staff would give preferential or better services to customers who were non-locals. Foodwise, to be fair, I enjoyed it. I ordered the Fiorentina Pizza (Salami, Spinach, Egg) which I'll highly recommend. The thin crispy crust was well balanced with the saltiness of the salami and generous amount of cheese. For small bites, I got the Truffled Parmesan Fries (S$15). It was sprinkled generously with truffle but the fries were way overdone. This killed the fluffiness of the potato, so basically it tasted like crispy sticks soaked in truffle oil. I found the fries towards the bottom of the bowl to be greasy. Other tables had similar fries so the over frying definitely wasn't a one-off event.My advice: Dress well if you're going there so that you get better treatment from the staff. Also, stick to the pizza and skip the fries
5
Have been to eat at lunch time on a number of occasions. The most recent was lunch with my husband.The set menu ($23++ @ March 2014) includes a salad, pasta, desert and coffee / tea. The food is of high quality, and this is great value for money.Can't book lunchtimes (or so I was told when I rang through). Does get busy on, e.g., a Friday but if you're there around 12 - 12.30 then there's always plenty of space
4
i enjoyed the food and wine. the ambience was nice even that night was so busy (aug 30) maybe bcoz the service is good and the food was great.... me and my friends will definitely come back here! highly recommended place to eat and drink...
4
Enjoyed a few meals here when staying in Holland Village for a while, the pizzas are very tasty and I would recommend a visit if you're in the village for lunch.
5
Been in Singapore for about 15 months. My experience with wait-staff has been less than enthusing but this place had staff, pasta and pizzas like I have not experienced here.Not open when we got there (20 min early) but happy to let us arrange ourselves and provide menus until they were.Usual reaction in Singapore being "..No, cannot..come back later..."The waitress knew every item and could explain them. Unlike the usual experience in Singapore restaurants where the main focus of the staff is their phone or what is happening with the "team" behind the bar/counter.Her attention could be attracted by the raising of an eye-brow. We didn't even have to raise a hand.And the food?Easy Italian, but the best I have found so far from Aus to Italy and beyond.Yes, you do pay. But no more than I have been so far at Kovan or Hougang or Punggol.Holland Village is Ang Mo central on steroids so you can expect to be bent over and pay for rubbish. Not here.Loved it
5
I pretty much a pizza snob, and I thought the pizza here was very good. I had the Diavola, with salami and red peppers. Great flavor, and the crust was thin and crunchy. The restaurant is located in a really cool area of Singapore, Holland Rd. You can walk around after eating and visit the shops and other bars in the area. Not too far from where I was staying, so it was easy to get to
4
It was my partners birthday so I decided to grant her wish as she wanted to eat pizza. Thankfully we came in before the norm Saturday dinner crowd, so we'd consider ourselves lucky. Service was friendly and warm upon entering. Somehow I just wished they could spend a little time to explain or tell us the specials of the day, albeit the blackboard out front, just a little mile more of attention.We shared the buffalo wings with tallegio fondue($14) for the antipasti. They should have stuck to the traditional BBQ coated instead of separating the sauce as it made the chix totally bland, inside and out. A pass for me.Than the mains came along and this deserves mentions. I had the Truffle Mushroom Lasagna($20) and it was earthy, creamy and each mouthful was loaded with truffly goodness. Seductive at first but overwhelming at the end. A very rich option.My other half had the Isola Verde pizza($25). 12" or 14" Gorgonzola, caramelized onions and baby spinach, plus we requested for additional mushrooms(+$3/4). Awesome I tell ya!! White based pizza, loaded with gorgon cheese with some chunky bits as well. It's a cheese lover paradise.Well, we spent about $95 for 1 starters, 2 mains, and 2 drinks. Hell, I don't care how much but I will definitely return for the pizza!Love it
4
Food was good. Service was good but it depends on who is serving. The price was high - almost $60 per person. we each had a starter and a main. The only thing i did not enjoy was the marinated olives - which i thougt i could do better. I would go back there again since it is convenient and a more chill-out atmosphere than other restaurants around chip be
4
This incredibly popular pizza restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating has a thriving atmosphere and is popular with expats. Service was great, but I thought everything on their menu aside from pizza is way overpriced. For example, a salad with sliced chicken, although better than the appetizer in most establishments in Singapore, was over S$22. Bottled beer is between S$12-14, and desserts were very high too. Pizza was good but it was certainly a little too salty and oily. I'd give this restaurant 3 star but bumped it up because of excellent location, ambience and service. Also, if you change your mind last minute, there are 3 more excellent restaurants next door. Street parking is available
2
Service was so bad we turned it into a game. Service was slow, basically absent ... but food was ok to good. Starting platter of smoked chorizo was great, as was ham with buffalo motz; but pizza was just ok (too salty with minimal flavor) wines good but over priced.
1
I didn't even get the chance to taste their food before I was completely put off by the rudeness of the staff member on the phone. I called to get prices (because their menu on FB doesn't display them and there is no other place online to get their menu) and to ask if they deliver. When I asked the guy, he said no, they do not do delivery in a disgusted voice and told me to call Pizza Hut.Thanks for the tip Da Paolo. I'd way rather have Pizza Hut any day. At least they have good customer service and consistent value
3
I would think Da Paolo's pizza bar at Chip Bee Gardens would impress since i love their desserts from their deli, a few doors away.My friends and I waited rather long to be seated, standing in a somewhat small queue at the entrance. The waiters took their own time to slowly clear tables and busy themselves with god knows what.For that price i was paying for the two pizzas we ordered to share, i was expecting something tastier and satisfying. Not only did we wait rather long for the pizzas to arrive, we had to remind the waiters of our orders once. and finally, when they served us, my first impression was that they were REALLY STINGY with pizza toppings for both pizzas.It was so obvious that the cook has literally calculated the number of toppings to go on each. slice. of pizza. a very pathetic- looking pizza dinner indeed.However, when i was there i did notice many families with kids, so i would think this pizza bar provides ample seating space for families who just want to shut their rowdy gang up with average tasting expensive "fast food" in a restaurant setting.this is pretty much a disgrace to the Da Paolo chain. I rather die than return again
4
This restaurant is right on the Circle Line (Holland Village) and this makes for easy access. The food at Da Paolo's is good and it is child friendly which is a real plus.
5
It serves great wood fired pizzas for about $20. It is located in Chip Bee Gardens in Holland Village, so on the quieter side of HV and a great spot for dinner.
3
Da Paolo Pizza Bar is my first choice for pizza -"BUFALA E CRUDO" It's a little more expensive than most others but it's worth it for such a delicious pizza.
4
Delicious pizza...
4
The cosy outdoor makes the meal really enjoyable
3
Went to De Paolo for their weekend breakfast with two friends. With an empty resturant, we waited 10 minutes to place a drinks order and another 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive (some sub par coffees). After negotiating a small change with one of the dishes, ordered and spent some time enjoying the outdoor location. This is a good place to meet friends. The food was better than expected, quite nice French toast with berries, and a breakfast hash brown stack (hash browns were pretty poor). Not too sure if I would go back. The breakfast is not worth making a trip for. The location near Holland Village is great, and it is in a string of solid restaurants. It is an ok option if you are in the area and want a pizza.
4
We are regulars at this restaurant in Holland V and it's quite a favorite for us. Lots of choice for pizza toppings, good food and excellent service. They don't take reservations so there may be a wait on the weekends. The decor is simple and tasteful with one wall displaying their wine collection. There is enough choice for vegetarians. The price is not cheap and a meal for two can easily set you back by a hundred dollars if you order drinks, a starter and 2 main course
3
The service was very attentive and warm. The location & atmosphere were great.The pizzas (a smoked salmon and a buffalo mozarella with parma ham) were decent enough, with quite generous amount of toppings and a crunchy, crackling base, but for one fault: they came out only warm, a few degrees above room temp.Don't know about y'all, but lukewarm pizzas seem like a blasphemy for me
5
Located near the end of a quiet tree lined restaurant street, the pizza bar produces excellent, thin crust pizzas. With seating outside and inside, it's a comfortable, laid back place. You often need to wait for a table on busy evenings, but it's worth it. The lemon meringue pie is also worth a try. The restaurant is closed Mondays
4
Visited for lunch on a Sunday. Indoor and outdoor seating available, with the indoor secrion opening out into the patio, giving a relaxed atmosphere. A mid-sized menu with pizzas, salads, soups and some meat dishes. The prosciutto et funghi pizza was very nicely executed, on a crispy pastry. The 'steak' was sliced into thin pieces and placed in wraps, like a taco. Prices were reasonable
3
Great italian. Outdoor seating in a nice neighbourhood.

Excellent pizza and the best calamari fritti I have ever eaten in Sinapore. Don't try the calamari in Da Paolo Ristorante though, it's not as good!

yummy yummy. However the use of spotlight at the row of table near the kitchen makes it a tad too warm :(

I love this place.
Their firewood pizza is simply divine. And their service too.

bread is soft & fluffy, wished they didnt serve commercial butter though.
The deep fried calamari was very fresh, and the carbonara I ate had a good consistency. Coffee was a tad too bitter tho. Service is tops

the lagsane that i had there once was slightly raw plus too much cheese.. it just kills the taste and turn me off for dinner.. otherwise.. pizza is still great for sunday brunch...
