You can count on fingers when we talk about the north Indian restaurants in western part of Singapore. This is one of the best with very reasonable prices.

OK to eat, if you want spicy ask them more spicy, so that atleast you will get some spicy.
Overall I can rate the food as 3.5 for 5.

We were happy with food quality. specially Naan and Malay Chicken tikka was good. Prices are reasonable. is overall clean. when we asked for cold water, they served from used plastic water bottle from fridge which was unprofessional and we didn't drink it. Rest was good

Went to Phoenix Indian restaurant for a quick meal with friends. Food is fresh and tasty. We ordered rogan josh and butter chicken, along with assorted naans. Both the dishes were nice and portion size was decent. I found fish head curry to be ordinary but again I don't expect a North Indian eatery to serve best fish head curries. Overall, we had a pleasant experience

I didn't know this place existed although I am residing about a km away. It was my son who suggested having our dinner at this restaurant which is within walking distance from my home.This restaurant is tucked away in a private housing estate. If you are taking the train, alight at the Phoenix LRT station, cross the road and walk towards Phoenix Road.The restaurant is small but cozy. The staff is approachable and the food delicious. Service is good and it is also reasonably priced. We enjoyed our dinner on this first visit. Will definitely go back again. Surprisingly while we were there, there are many local Chinese diners there too.

This was our 4th time there and it keeps getting better. In addition to the delicious variety of nans and curries, there are a couple of wines to complement the meal. Great place for a family meal. No problems with parking now with a cash card system installed. Recommended for a good meal with attentive service.

It's the only place in the area to get north indian food. The food is alright but is nothing special. Considering it's located in an open car park near the HDB, the prices are high. It is clean however.The service has gone down. There is no warm welcome and no friendliness from the staff. I would suggest you take a bus or a cab and have north indian food in little India.
