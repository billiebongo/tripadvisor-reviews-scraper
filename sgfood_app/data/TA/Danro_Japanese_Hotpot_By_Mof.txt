Large variety of choice in menu and it includes japanese, chinese and western cuisine. Staff were responsive and service are good.
3
surprised that they’d changed the concept, combining juhao with danro which meant we could order from both sides. food was ok.
5
We always go to danro Bugis because of the myriad choices and prompt services provided by the staff.
3
Only have ala carte options, personally I feel that it should offer set meals.
The food and service are average, nothing really impress me.
4
Another cool Japanese casual dining concept by MOF~ The guy behind MOF is always innovating, taking fusion cuisines into play~ =)
5
repeat customers to the restaurant. Food is satisfying and staff are prompt. Always a pleasure to dine here
4
Our usual place for dinner, nice place, quiet and clean. My children like the hot pot set and the refillable ice green tea.
2
Many things unavailable at 7.30pm on a Saturday. Wait time was long, food was so so. We spent alot of time thinking what to order even though menu was a huge variety. But also because many options weren't available.
4
Good food choices. By combining the store with 4 of its brands, it offered a variety of food to choose from
1
We really wouldn't recommend this place. Mediocre food, small cramped seats and the hotpot (supposedly tagged to their name danro collagen hotpot) only allowed a single soup refill, not a full refill, just a casual big bowl with soup poured into the hotpot. Not a pleasant visit
3
Food is ok. Service is passable. Price is reasonable. Menu is comprehensive, with japanese, chinese and western food.
3
It was value for money, wide variety of selection. Food quality was acceptable, service crew was not very attentive. Tablet for ordering wasn't user friendly, most of the dinners were not using the table.
5
My 4th visit to this restaurant. My children enjoy the hot pot with pork belly. Ingredients and meat are very fresh.
4
Huge menu, like over 200 items I think. Can be confusing for customer. Food however was surprisingly good, dessert was average.
4
Food is value for money and although not the supreme grade of freshness, it justifies the bill. Repeat visitor. Only thing is you may have to wait for quite a while on a Fri evening when it's crowded
4
We go to danro when we can't decide what we want to eat because there is a wide selection of choices. That said, food is rather mediocre, so don't be too particular
4
Great casual Japanese dining place with lots of variety for you to choose from!! From hotpot to sushi/donburi/ramen, to even Chinese food!! =)
4
Chirashi don was pretty tasty with lots of sashimi. Not too expensive either. Waited half an hour for my food though.
2
Well-served by the staff, but the variety of the set meal need to be reviewed, The atmosphere was good.

Ministry of Food has set up 2 buffet concepts at the corner of level 1 at Punggol Waterway Point. We’ve visited Daessiksin (大食神) Korean BBQ Buffet previously and thought it was not worth a review. This time, we visited Danro Collagen Hotpot Buffet Punggol Waterway Point to try out its 美人锅 (Beauty Hotpot) and thought it was well worth it.The price of Danro Collagen Hotpot Buffet Punggol Waterway Point is actually pretty inexpensive. At $24.90++ for adults (and $13.90++ for kids) for dinners and weekends, it’s not too bad. But if you’re able to make it for lunch during weekdays, prices goes as low as $15.90++ for adults and $11.90++ for kids! Now, that’s a steal! Do note that you’ll have to top up $5, if you’d like to try the collagen soup base.Read more about our review on 2bearbear

Went for the collagen hotpot set and was pretty disappointed with it. It probably pales in comparison with the buffet outlet at Nex. The soup wasn't as nice; vegetable serving was quite a bit. The place is rather clean though service a bit slow.
3
From its name, this restaurant is a Japanese restaurant, but in addition to Japanese food, it also provides a western menu. The quality of the price appeal is average. Nothing special from the restaurant.
4
Chinese dishes (from ju hao) + western dishes (from MOF) also available, in addition to the Japanese hotpot from danro. We were spoilt for choice
4
Centralised location. Sofa we sat on was torned. They have menu from MOF chains. So a great variety of food for people who wants choices.
2
Honestly speaking, nothing fantastic about this hotpot.
And it took them a long time (or never?) to refill the desserts(cocktail/ice cream etc), and yesterday, there were totally no ice at all for the drinks.
Not much of satisfaction eating there.
Spent $68 for 2 pax
2
My family waited quite a bit to be served despite booking a table through chope.
When we walked into the restaurant and it was quite empty!
2
Supposedly, they should have hotpot. However, the Bugis outlet doesn't offer hotpot buffet and we have to order ala-carte nabe.
4
We get to choose from Ju hao, danro and Lena's menu. Able to have favourite dishes from different cuisines.
3
Recommend their curry rice, the gravy is thick and taste great.the price abit costly compared to others, and their service still can be improved, as we pressed the service bell for couple times, nobody serve us. and we ordered coffee, ended up came with a tea.
5
It was my first time using chope application to make a reservation. The experience was good , and the process went well and smooth. Went in and was serve by the staffs and was directed to my reservation tables. Food a was nice and ambiance was good.
4
their collagen hotpot is awesome but the location is abit hot.
a grp of us (7pax) went on fri night and there is abit shortage of staff, but staff is quite attentive.
5
Both, me and my girlfriend enjoyed the food tremendously. Cost of food was reasonable, and so was the serving. Will definitely bring my friends there for our gatherings.
4
Serve good food with very wide selection. Chinese, western and japanese cuisines. Food is served fast and hot.
3
The Pork Collagen soup and Sukiyaki soup is nice. They have a healthy bar of vegetables, tofu, some mini seafood but no fish or prawns. They have a unlimited serving of meat which I find it okay. Beef Chicken Pork.. I like very much.
4
I've never been to a restaurant that offered such a wide variety of food within each categories of Japanese, Western, Chinese menu. Great for family with members of different preference.
4
the service is quite good and the food quality is good too! though it can be quite pricy! might try again!

If you have eaten the collagen hotpot at Bijin Nabe you will find the one at DANRO (Bugis) with a weird taste. The veggie serving was huge but there was not enough soup to go around. If you dont want to waste food you would be forced to add more soup (7$). At this point my Friend and I were not keen about savouring it because it didn't taste nice. Customer service was disappointing as well, the crew had no idea what to do with the hotpot, at one point improperly placing the pot on the stove. We were honestly afraid that the pot might topple and scald at least one of us. It was faster waving them to our table than them responding to us pressing the bell.
4
The buffet is great with free flow drinks + ice cream + 1 cooked food which is noodles.The vegetables selection is acceptable and the ala carte meat cut is good and tender. It's worthy if it's 1 for 1.The sauce selection is tasty and delicious.There are a couple of soup bases and we had the sukiya and enjoy it loads
3
We booked the Danton Bugis for the chicken collagen steamboat, but was confused when we were given the menus of others, which after that we realized it is a combination of different cuisines into one place under MOF. The steamboat is quite disappointing as it was quite bland. We were told only one free top up of soup and it was top up with normal soup instead of the collagen. It was quite expensive as well. Service is ok though
2
Food and drink took very long to arrive, and only start to appear after manager was alerted. If you are waiting for drinks or top up - expect to really wait. Our bowls never appear even after two reminders. They are too busy to serve diners
5
App is easy to use, since it is a Holiday, longer waiting time for food (didn't inform use before we are seated)
4
Good selection of food . The Yu sheng was good at $28.80 and good for four persons. However, the tempura which showed up was only half the size shown on the menu
2
Service was bad. Waiter and waitresses are not responsive enough.
For reservation, may i know why we cannot reserve seqts for more than 6pax?
1
It's a great disappointment for their service. Very disorganised and staff are very short for a lunch time even after 145pm. Can see many customers were very unhappy as well that prompted me to write this feedback.
4
Went there with my partner and we ordered the hotpot for 2 pax. Portion wise just nice for two and they have lots of variety ranging from Japanese to western to Chinese cuisine. Lastly, the staffs there were friendly and polite.
3
Danro has a good variety of Japanese food to choose from. I enjoyed the hotpot best. It's also what their specialty. I would go again to try other food items.
4
Nice and portion is good for 2-3 persons to share... No extra charges for topping up of soup.. Will definitely go back again...
2
We tried the party nabe steamboat and was quite disappointed at the quality of the food. The addition salmon wasn't sliced instead was just Two fish tail portion from a very very pale salmon(think more white than red). With a total gross bill at 50+ dollars with two ice lemon tea, the quality should live up to the bill. Not recommended to try party nabe. Perhaps other

Had a MOF Danro booking using chope app for 4 adults and 1 child, on Monday evening. Booking was easy. However, sadly, the collagen hotpot which we plan to eat was not available. Instead, we had charashi don with a complete meal. It was yummy and fresh. Environment was pleasant and cosy. The manager was helpful in guiding us to download poket rewards app to get 10% disc using the in-app voucher.

There are a couple of outlets in Singapore. My wife and i went to the outlet at Pungool Waterway. Was ushered in by the service staff to have a look at the food they provide first then decide on if we wanted to try. When in an have a look at the buffet line and decided to go for the buffet. Before we are assign to a seat, we had to pay first. After payment, i was assigned to we were assign to our seats and told that we had 80mins to complete our dinner. Sounds reasonable to me as there was only 2pax. Soup base came and was briefly introduce by one of the waitress about the different meat they supply free flow however, she couldn't differentiate between beef and chicken. Other than the Soup Base, there is really nothing special. Here is my actual reviewService: 2.5/5 ( Soup not topped up promptly, unable to differentiate meat, plates not cleared promptly)Food: 3.5/5 (not much choices for buffet line, only drinks they have is Lemonade, Water and coffee machine and green tea. Plus point ice cream bar)Value: 2/5 For $63 for 2pax with very limited choice is not really value for mone
