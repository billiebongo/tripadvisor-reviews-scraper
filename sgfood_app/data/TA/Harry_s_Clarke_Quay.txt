Just had a snack here in the evening, but very tasty. Drinks are no more expensive than anywhere else and the service isn't good.
5
Good food, reasonably priced, good service, I had the flatbread with basil and tomatoes, my husband had pasta, both were well prepared and very tasty. Will go there again if (or hopefully when) we visit Singapore again.

This is a burger joint along the Clarke Quay waterfront. The food was okay but not great and the service was awful. We were a party of eight and meals arrived at different times with one in our group not getting her burger at all. Very disorganized in service and in paying the bill
3
The choice of dishes is varied and tempting; Indian, Mexican, Chinese and European. Everyone should be able to satisfy his buds.The food was good although the chicken and beef satay was a bit dry and the meat tough.Service was very slow and somehow too relaxed.I think we won’t go back
3
We decided to have fish and chips as we had long not arrived in Singapore and didn't have time or energy to keep walking to find something other than Asian food to eat.We sat outside down overlooking the QUAY. Our fish and chips turned up, which was not exceptional, the only thing that was the BILL. The problem is time you have added the extras on like service charge and tax it is very expensive, and not worth the money

We went on a business meeting to the Harry at marina bay financial center. We reached at 4:51pm but were told that happy hour starts at 5pm. So we hung around and came back at 5pm. We got a table and asked the waitress about the happy hour and were told that we can get a pint of the house lager for 9 bucks. We ordered 2 pints and when time came for the bill, we were billed full price. That’s because the time of order on the receipt was 4:58pm. We requested the waiters to consider our case and let us pay the happy hour price but were denied.Misled into believing that happy hour had started. Ended up paying full price. Avoid this place. The house lager is probably anchor beer. Nearby Boshido and Erwin’s are much better for ambience and drinks quality.

Went over with my partner for lunch and we ordered fish and chips and 1 chicken dish as per recommendation.Fish tasted old and smelt. Could hardly get the attention of the staffs there during a non peak hour. Overall it was a disappointment.Harry's was one of my Favourite hangout place, but now it's definely not a place I would like to visit back

Drinks is pretty standard with a slight variation of prices along this watering hole, so service standards would be a key differentiating factor. Unfortunately, this place has pretty average service, with careless interactions with the patrons. We were regularly and rudely interrupted and asked if we wanted more drinks before we finished our round, not to mention the frequent bumps by the staff, though seemingly unintentional, can be really very irritating throughout the night. Hope the service improves

On my latest visit for the visit to Harry during the Liverpool and Man City, I was pretty upset on almost everything. I guess the furniture though looking new, they probably need to be replaced. It stinks badly. The " scent " were accumulative amount of perspire stays on the fabric and penetrate to the foam. I was really uncomfortable but thats the best spot i think i can find for the view. On the food itself. I've ordered fish and chips battered with beer...something like that. I was expecting the taste can be richer, it doesn't taste anything, not even seasoned with salt. The chips were sprinkles with spices, salad was just okay. Somehow you its up to you to buy it or not, that Harry was really good in the older times. Perhaps, restructure required. Beers and atmosphere are absolutely fine. Personally, it should be maintained and quality of the food

Dropped by for a few drinks pre dinner drinks on a recent trip to SP. Staff and service were great and to be honest we should have stayed for dinner given the food we saw coming out to patrons. Will be trying out Harry's for dinner next time in SP

Harry Pub in Clarke Quay is good place for Happy hours as the prices are reasonable. However, the music is far to deafening
4
Been here a few times when I visit Singapore, always a friendly welcome and good food and drink. situated on Clarke Quay popular place to visit
4
Food was tasty and portion size good but You're paying too much in our opinion because it's on Clarke Quay.
Staff friendly enough.

After a very hot boat cruise this was a close , ideal location for a cool drink overlooking the river. Efficient service and reasonably priced.

We chose to eat at Harry's based on the Buy 1 Get 1 deal they had on Monday lunchtime, and the wide choice on the menu. The restaurant was not busy at all, just one other table eating. We ordered quickly (Signature club sandwich and Harry's burger) as we wanted just a quick pit stop before carrying on sightseeing. The burger came out after perhaps 25 minutes, which we thought was quite a long wait but no problem, we were planning our afternoon on the free wifi! My husband started eating whilst it was hot and I waited for my club sandwich...and waited...after 5 minutes I asked the waitress how long my food would be and off she went to the kitchen to find out. After a few minutes she came back to apologise that the order had not actually gone through to the kitchen due to a system error, and it would be another 20 minutes. She did bring my fries out to get started with. When my club sandwich finally arrived it was ok, the kimchi slaw was nice, certainly not worth a 45 minute wait for though!I was really disappointed by the service as if I hadn't had called the waitress over to chase up my food I don't think they would have even noticed it wasn't out, they seemed disinterested in their customers. We were in the restaurant for significantly longer than we had expected to be due to this issue and ate in shifts! It would have been nice to have had something offered as a goodwill gesture, and if the meals had not been buy one get one free I would have pursued that further

A fantastic location and a good European menu. I had the soba salad and was very happy, the husband had the pizza and was very content with the quality. My only negative is that portions were a little smaller than I would have preferred. Normally a salad would satisfy me, but not on this occasion - I had to order a side of chips (kind of wrecks the idea of having a salad).I would go back
3
We came across Harry's while wandering around, and they had a game we were interested in up on the screen so we ordered drinks and sat to watch. The atmosphere was casual, but service was prompt. However, $25 for a beer and a glass of wine seemed a bit excessive
5
This bar is right in the middle of Clarke Quay near the fountain. We usually went here for happy hour of an evening. They have live entertainment and the service is good. Gets busy around 7 p.m. when everyone finishes work. It is surrounded by many other bars, its a happening place to be

There was a very friendly environment and the view is lovely. Sitting by the river eating and drinking, we went during happy hour so the one for one beer was good value.The slow cooked beef was so good as was the rest of the meals.The only downside is the toilets they are very small and untidy. The men's toilet had no toilet roll which didn't help when one of the children wanted to use it.
3
If you come for the 5 pm Happy Hour you get one drink free when you order one. The location along the river is nice, and there can be a nice breeze. The food is not bad, but nothing to shout about. The flatbread pizza's are pretty tasty
3
A typical bar but I have to mark them down for their idea of poutine - it was closer to nachos. Canadians would not be happy AT ALL.
1
I bought 2 Asahi draft beers here which cost a staggering $38.
Never again.
Avoid this place it's a rip off.

I looked through the menu and as soon as my eyes alighted on "Fish and Chips", the decision was made. And what a decision it was! Two lovely opieces of haddock, cooked just right, and an abundance of crispy fried chips ... Beyond awesome!!

April 9th Met at the door by a very disinterested lady.Went inside to a gloomy dining area. We ordered 2 steak with egg and it looked ok until you tried to eat it. Mine was mostly fat and almost impossible to cut never mind eat. My wife's was not much better.We complained to the Manager?and showed him the meat but initially he said that it was cooked as we asked not understanding that I was complaining about the meat itself, not the way it was cooked. The meal cost $29 each plus tax plus service charge though why we had to pay service charge is beyond me. we did recieve a 10% discount because of the complaint. Within 1 hour, I suffered a serious bout of stomach cramps followed by severe diarrhoea and I have no doubt that this was the result of the meal at Harry

Like all the eateries / drinking establishments along the river you need to pick your time.ie happy hour. Otherwise expensive Singapore becomes unsustainable when your on a holiday budget! Drinks, service and food were all very good combined with a riverside visa. Try the Chiptease for a quick and filling snack
5
We went to the place near the fullerton hotel. Best is to walk around a bit on the promenade & may be take a boat ride on the river.They have a great selection of drinks, will satisfy most. But don't expect it to be a top of line specialist bar.The food is decent & has a few veg options
2
Our waiter was not at all friendly or pleasant. The prices are quite high, and prices change according to the time of day, and of course higher at lunch and dinner.Beer prices were twice as high as another restaurant tow blocks away.We would not go back
4
Stopped off to eat on a busy Friday Night with friends. Service was pretty good, food was served quickly with friendly smiles. Kill Bill cocktail was delish I have to say, and the overall bill for Singapore was reasonable. It was easy to find a seat at about 9PM, so check it out if you're in town

First I want to apologize I came to this place on this rainy Sunday afternoon. I am so sorry I came here with the intention to grab a beer and some food with my family. I am so sorry to make use of your service on a Sunday. My goodness, skip this place by all means. Attitude of we have to be grateful to take place at this crappy place.please close this business for good. Wings were to oily to handle, burger with some thing that seemed to be have the intention to be meat. Mayonaise.... Question mark on her face, no we don't have.... WTF. Thanks for wasting my sunday

Visited on a Sunday afternoon. We were "greeted", for lack of a better word, by a grumpy staff member that sort of threw the menu at us, with a "can't you go somewhere else instead, I really don't want to work today" kind of attitude. We ordered drinks, she took off, came back with the order and immediately presented us the bill. I said we didn't ask for the bill yet.Her rude reply: "I'm working alone so I'm giving you the bill". That is just so rude! And it wasn't even busy. The staff was just lazy, ruined the experience and had absolutely no "can do" attitude to make the experience a pleasure. Too bad I don't remember her name, because she should be reprimanded. Not going here again

the food, place and ambience is nice, fast, efficient, friendly, promptly, courteous, cheerful and clean!

Ok food good drink and nice service-- overall enjoyed though far from a memorable meal-- excellent ambiance
5
Happy with the set lunch.
The wait staff is attentive.
Menu is expansive & price friendly too.
Enjoyed the quality of food.
4
Great spot for a quick drink, or a longer meal. Meals looked good, but we only had drinks. Staff were friendly. Just across from the hub of Clarke Quay. Not a fan of smoking in pubs & restaurants, even though it was outdoors.
4
The food is consistently good across the different branches. Try their signature wings, ribs, satay, etc. It's a great place to be with friends.
5
Found this place on our first night in Singapore. Staff were great and remembered what drinks we had the previous night (always a plus in my book) food was good and we ended up visiting Harry's several times during our stay in Singapore. No complaints at all about this place. Remember Happy hour until 20:00

I loved Harry's at Boat Quay when they had a house band. This was the only reason I went to Harry's. For me, it's a typical expat bar, which means everything on the menu is overpriced. On this visit I was lazy and just ordered a burger with fries. The entire place is open air so all the seats are riverview. The staff is great. If you just want a quick drink and chill, this is not a bad plac

Had dinner here for our last night in Singapore and it was awesome. My mother, daughter and I all had ribs which just fell off the bone. We were lucky enough to order before 8pm and only paid $15s each instead of $30s. They also have happy hour which made the night one if the cheapest in Singapore. The staff were friendly and service was good. Highly recommend this restaurant

Shared the tandoori skewers for a starter which were the best I have had outside top Indian restaurants. The ribs were my main and they were excellent. The fries were good and the accompanying salad fresh. Lots of restaurant choices at Clarke Quay but out of the 4 or 5 I have tried this was definitely the best

I've been grabbing drinks at this bar for a long time even before when it was previously Marrakesh. I can say they have the best and nicest staff around the area. I even became friends with the previous bartender and one of their staff. All smiles happy to take your order or speak to you with some funny banters if you are alone.They always have a promo which lasts till 8pm. The location is right in the heart of CQ. You can be entertained by the TV sets outside or inside for Football or Rugby aficionados (which makes the place packed during game seasons). It is right in front of the fountain where you can see kids playing. Also next to the hippest clubs in the area so live music won't be a problemI highly recommend this place for a chilled beer session. Come and visit them at Clarke Quay !
