Latte Latte Latte from craftsmen
Spend $8.90 every morning is a heavy but the latte becomes addictive in a good way

Location is just right opposite to Siglap center..
variety of food and drink selections. Coconut Latte taste good.. we ordered buttered croissant.. truffle fries and Aglio Olio Prawn Pasta, was all delicious and big portion ..
will come back and try other menu next time

Well crafted everything, coffee, selection of beers, restaurant's details and amazing brunch food our of the tiny kitchen. Best almond croissant in Singapore, much better than TBB!

Ordered two cappuccino and 2 pastries to go with. The pastries arrived relatively quickly but the coffee took ages and when arrived the waiter was having on his hand two take away cups. We were surprised and we said that we ordered cappuccino to stay but the waiter said that they did not have anymore cups (I assume clean cups). It would have been nice to be asked if was ok to have take away cups or if we wanted to wait more for the cappuccino. Of course they charged 22$ for those cappuccino e pastries like stay in rather than take away! Thieves. Wrote to the customer service and waiting for an answer plus a refund of my money! If I wanted to have a cup take away I would have gone to Starbucks which is around the corner. You need to learn a lot in Customer service guys.....

we come here too often because we live around the corner and every time we are here for brunch, the service gets worse and worse. You don't get a " Good Morning " or even a " Hi" from anyone. For $60 every weekend, they should really be a bit more polite to their regular customers or customers in general. Good food good coffee Cold bake beans and even Colder Service.

After our dinner nearby, we decided to look for dessert and we happen to pass by this cafe, so decided to go in and give it a try. We have ordered a mango lavender cake and a lychee oriental tea, the tea bottle is unique though so we decided to give it a try. After payment and the cake is being served fast, the cafe is not very crowded and it is very cosy with a lot of fanciful decoration inside. The mango cake is very smooth and soft, the mango cream is superb. The lychee tea wise is a bit bitter but after sipping more it eventually became more sweet. We will definitely be back to try out its breakfast menu on one of the weekend, highly recommended

Portion size of breakfast is never consistent especially on week ends in this joint! Quality suffers too over the week ends! Salad without dressing is a norm....Never visit over the week end, it's over crowded and the smell of greasy oil simply put you off your food! Please improve on your ventilation for the price u are charging. For A cup of coffee latte large with soya milk, one need to pay a whopping $2.80! The new system where there is no system requires the waiters going round searching for customer's order! This place had truly disappointed me again and again.

Twiddling thumbs and decided to come here for a weekday lunch. Nice quiet venue in Siglap with cool decor inside. Friendly staff, a few other customers but not busy.Ordered some scrambled eggs and an iced flat white at the counter, went to sit at table and they bought it over. Pretty tasty and enjoyable. Worth a repeat visit

Went for lunch today but waited for more than 30 minutes for a plate of beef stew pasta. Went up to 2 staff to check on my order after one of them didn't get back to me. Got the usual 'its coming soon' reply. When it finally came, I asked nicely how come it was so slow and the waiter just shrugged his shoulders. I didn't give up and asked him to check with the kitchen. Then he said there are many orders of pasta and not enough hands to serve. Wow. From what I can see, your staff are laughing and chit-chatting away. I used to like your food and staff. But standards have dropped. Alot. The pasta is definitely not worth waiting for over 30 minutes. And your service definitely won an award for being terrible

We wondered in by accident to be honest while looking for a Starbucks. We decided to have a look at the menu. And we stayed. We had a small bite and I tried the house made lemonade and my husband tried the cold brew. The spot has a nice atmosphere, a lot of locals, which made us feel like a part of community. It is delicious, so it is worth a look
4
Had very good breakfast there. Some items I believe are overpriced. Otherwise I would have given 5/5.
5
A must have breakfast/brunch. A great place to chill! Coffee is one of the best i had in singapore! Will visit again!!
5
One of the many quaint coffee shops with a Uber cool ambience . Though limited space , the food is delectable both for breakfast or just for a coffee conversation too. Must visit in siglap
4
A great little coffee shop that attracts an interesting mix of people. Delicious food, fantastic caramel lattes, good staff, some interesting pop music and a nice relaxing environment.

This coffee shop looked interesting and friendly and we just wanted a quick coffee and something small to eat before we set off to explore Singapore on a one day there (yes, I know you need more than one day but it was only a quick stopover). We went in and ordered two large coffees and toast with jam for one plus a small patisserie for the other. The food came straight away then we had to wait 30 minutes for our coffees. So much for the short stop. We could see the barista behind the counter standing there with small cups of coffee and madly stirring the contents with a spoon, then about every 5 minutes or so we would hear the gurgles of the machine. We noticed that the customers coming in getting takeaway had priority over the guests at the tables - perhaps short staff - one to make coffee for the takeaways and one to look after the customers. But not, they had one efficient guy serving the food and either a beginner or someone who had no idea of quick service on the machine. When we finally received our coffee the food had long been consumed although the toast was warm bread not toast. The coffee was luke warm and uninspiring. Won't be returning.

Have been wanting to try the food here and finally went over with colleagues for a quick lunch today. Ordered a plate of sautÃ©ed mixed mushroom spaghetti. The food presentation is wonderful and the portion is generous. Am so full after finished the plate...tried the churros with ice cream and the taste is just melting and wonderful. Will definitely try it again, especially the coffee.
4
I felt almost as though I was at home in Melbourne at this lovely little spot in Singapore. The menu, coffee, food and staff were all great, with no complains really.Not quite at a Melbourne standard, and as is the case in most Asian countries, there are no changes allowed to the menu. Pricey, but standard for a good place like this in Singapore. All in all, a great spot and I'll be back
4
The atmosphere is very vibrant and cosy. Seats are very limited so high chance you will need to share table with others which I did. Staff are very friendly to ensure you are fine and items are served quick and hot. My friend had a cappuccino and I had churros with ice cream. Loved it. Staff event old my friend that the coffee will not be as nice once bubbles start forming so it was something new to us
5
Good experience in this cafe !!! They provided good customer service as their staffs are very friendly and always show a "smile" face when they are serving their customers. Other than that, food and drinks are delicious as well! Their service was higher than my expectations RECOMMENDED !!

The cafe itself is in a nice location and offers a relaxed environment and setting. Unfortunately, that is where the positives end.We ordered a summer salad which was supposed to come with beetroot, feta and pomegranate seeds, and a veg burrito (mushrooms, cabbage, salsa and cheese). The salad was the biggest disappointment. For $15 we received what looked like one cube of feta crushed over the salad, two slices of beetroot and a smattering of pomegranate seeds. We decided to send it back and ask for more toppings as was what we had received was a joke. In return, we received a small helping of pulled pork plonked in the middle. We couldn't be bothered to complain again and left half of it.The burrito arrived after, and was essentially full of cabbage, a crispy wrap and unmelted cheese. Again, a disappointment with most of it left.The company is either having financial problems or just don't understand how to please customers. Avoid!
5
This place has never turn us down. The only thing I would complaint about is their pricing. Full breakfast cost over $20.
Coffee is good.
4
This place is usually crowded but has a very good location. The staff are very friendly and food was very child friendly. They had very nice coffee and eggs.
5
Less variety in the food menu, but the existing options are good. The coffee is absolutely great, and this is my goto source of Joe in the neighborhood.
4
Great place for coffee and dessert was good too, food is above average, chocolate cake is great and a must try. Will repeat for the coffee
5
Love the food there, never fail to amaze! Love the window seats though the decos are getting a bit dusty.
1
Unfortunately a common reoccurring theme in so many establishments in SG regarding truly pitiful personnel...The café itself is quaint and the bill of fare is engaging enough however the whole experience is ruined by the impertinent, ignorant staff on hand.. Are manners and social graces really that difficult to grasp? Evidently so in this abode..

We arrived at the place just after 9AM, and placed our order:- Craftsmen Full Breakfast ($24.00)- Smoked Salmon Savory Waffles ($19.00)- Iced Chocolate ($7.00)- Long Black ($5.00)The drinks were so-so, there was nothing special about it. The raw sugar was found near to the door, and were all clumped together (sign of humidity, or being left in the sugar jar for too long).The food - it arrived after a 15-20 minute wait, and was completely cold. I can't give any good comments at all. We did not return the food because we were hungry and did not want to return it to the kitchen and risk another half-hour wait.The place was bustling with the morning breakfast crowd, most of which seemed to be expats or the more affluent locals who live in the neighbourhood (came dressed in flip-flops and PJs). There were also those who came decked out for an afternoon cocktail party (at 9AM in the morning???).Very weird crowd indeed, and not child-friendly at all due to the tremendous amount of noise (felt like an evening drinks/bar crowd actually!)Can't say much about service, since they didn't charge for it, but the total bill came to $55.00, which was VERY overpriced considering the fact that the food came cold. I can understand the fact that the kitchen is swamped with the tickets from customers, but cold food normally means there's a de-synchronization between the kitchen and the servers.Oh, and if you do patronize this "hipster" cafe, just waltz right in and take the first empty seat you find. Nobody will come up to you and seat you down

Amongst the rows of shophouses at goldhill centre.Went in. Studied the menu Should think about getting new menus. Paper was wearing thin.Tried their smoked salmon brioche.Not bad. Poached eggs were uneven.Bread was soggy after a few minutes.Will probably be keeping my regular jaunt to TCG nearby
4
I prefer table service for brunch and lunch, but as hipster café community is growing, it is kind of expected of the costumer to take part in the serving. Other then not being served, I liked the ambience the coffee and the food too. Desert was a hit and miss. My chocolate cake was super yummy but my hubby's salted caramel cake hasn't tasted as caramel at all. It gets crowded during brunch hours, better to book a table the day before you want to eat there.
4
Nice small coffee shop I found while cycling. Cappuccino was good, came with a small chocolate on the side. Had a breakfast / brunch menu. They need to keep it a bit cleaner. Food scraps on table with far too many flies. Open from 0900 to 1930.
3
Tried this for the first time for lunch. The pasta was a little small in portion. The Gentlemen's platter has a bit too much ham in my opinion and would be good 2 pcs of ham were replaced with some eggs instead. Sausages were yummy.
4
Good coffee and tea selection, and full cafe menu with ample seating for kicking back solo, for business or with friends. Recommend the iced espresso late!
4
Better coffee and music, more variety of food, compliment with wifi. This is absolutely better than the Starbucks nearby!
5
Very food tea (I tried some, but only one I didn’t like, the Nil tea) The fresh made waffles are great!
5
This is a modern polished cement floor black steel work...you know the look. Friendly smiling staff, fantastic food and great coffee. It is a "top end" type pricing and it should be because it is top quality done well done right. First time. Near the tax office ("inland revenue") and in the Novena area it trounces the likes of the Star Bucks franchises
5
One of the favorite coffee shops near our house in Siglap that we frequent for breakfast especially with friends and kids. Like the stylish ambience and the good english breakfast spread. Very trendy but then can get cramped for space especially on sunday mornings. Must try for their coffees
5
I love this place. The coffee is gorgeous the drink options are endless. The food perfect waffles are the star but there eggs are perfect and the smashed avocado tasty.Love the surly quick efficient service. All staff are clearly good at what they do. But cool with it. Music is great. They offer wifi so it's a great place to hide away from the world and get your caffeine hit. Shhh Don't share with anyone else.

This place in Siglap came recommended by friends for a tasty weekend brunch. Compared to other local lunch places like Rabbit Carrot Gun and Cafe Melba they don't offer table service and the staff weren't very chirpy either. The menu was a hit & miss of options and the fact that there's no real kitchen made me worry about the outcome.I had the sourdough with avo and feta and it was ok. No real feta unfortunately. My wife had the poached egg with avo and tomato on a muffin and that was unfortunately a disaster. The egg was poached in a mold that tasted bland, was too runny and it still had some cooking water with it. Terrible way to cut corners, it's really not difficult to poach an egg properly.Coffee on the other hand was quite good.Overall, won't recommend and likely won't be back for more than a coffee
5
They served good coffee and breakfast all day long. Fresh squeezed orange juice machine and beer if you are not a coffee fan. Their pricing is slightly expensive but the food are good. Try the bacon with waffles or the salmon poached egg with thick toast!

We went to this place at Novena branch yesterday. We ordered ;- Flat White - Salted Caramel Latte - Butter Croissant Flat White came in ugly which I was quite surprised as for "Craft, Speciality" tags on this place. I speak out loud to my hubby how ugly his coffee is and as table was close to the counter. I bet the barista heard it. It was only 3 tables occupied (including my table). The other tables were there and got cups of coffee already. It was no excuse for rushing to make it. So, the second cup of coffee serve in proper way it should be. Both of coffees only lukewarm which mean the temperature wasn't right. The measurements of espresso shot and microfoam was off balance. We weren't impressed of quality of coffees here. The butter croissant which looks quite right on the outside. It turns out inside wasn't and tasteless. The staffs here somehow needed a motivation to pay attention to do their job properly. Nice ambiance, cute decorations and ruined by the taste of coffees and pastries
3
...to slower days. I've never encountered a slower barista in my life. Once the coffee arrives, it's pretty good.
The fact that they they reheat leftover pastries from the previous day's delivery has turned me off from ordering food here.
2
Had the croissant sandwich with scrambled eggs and salad in it. Wasn't well toasted and didn't taste as good as it looked on the menu. Had cold drinks, which weren't special at all. Perhaps only their coffee is worth trying
4
Craftsmen at Siglap center is our preferred place for breakfast in Singapore. The coffee is excellent. At the weekend it tend to be quite busy. However, during the week we enjoy the quiet and relaxed athmosphere,
4
Had a nice morning coffee in this cafe catering mostly for foreigners in Singapore. It was a quite busy Saturday morning. The latte art for the flat white is impressive. The Almond Croissant is delicious as well.
3
At Mount Elizabeth Novena blurry eyed after eyes exam was happy to spot a Starbucks right in the lobby. Disgusted after TEN minutes wait only one attendant chatting away with two ladies to heart's delight I walked home stopped at Craftsmen, United Square. Sales rep pushy but friendly talked me in to an almond croissant with a double espresso. Both average. My loss but don't regret missing the Starbucks blueberry crumble muffin and espresso. They need to understand customer service and overall experience.
3
At this boutique coffee shop? Family owned cafe - and usually some of the best coffee in Singapore. Ok you pay premium prices but normally its worth it. Latest visit and the coffees were served barely even luke warm .... No problem - every place has its bad days - but nice feedback to the team was met with .... Well you should have ordered extra hot ....It's a great cafe - just hope the standards don't slip furthe
5
My first visit to this place and it definitely will not be my last time. A wonderful experience with friends, nice place for chitchatting, and food are delicious and fine with good quality and fresh ingredients.Variety of main dishes and beverages are a lot, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks for you to choose from. Not to mention my favorite Tapping Tapir sodas. And the desserts are yummy too!Price wise is reasonable, with that kind of service, food and environment. So glad that they have another branch at 173 Thomson Road which is nearer to my home. Will definitely go there and breakfast together with my husband!Keep it up with the good job and maintain your high standard of service and food quality. A wonderful place and I will be back!!
4
A good following even on a wkday after 2pm thinking you will be able to avoid the office crowd is a wrong belief. A lively place to hang out for good expensive small portion barista coffee.We chose the pulled pork burito which has cinnamon stewed pork tossed with purple raw cabbage and baked beans. The spicy taste is very light against the hollande sauce, it really build up your next savory bite.The smoked salmon croissant was very fresh and the croissant didnt flake out like some do with fresh salad.A good place for brunch at S$34.80

I have been to Craftsmen a few times, but was disappointed with my last visit. We ordered and our drinks and my partners food was delivered. We waited and waited seeing everyone else being served. My partner finished his food and then decided to talk to them. We were told that my food was prepared but an ingredient was missing and someone had gone to fetch some. He was then concerned that my order for hot food would be cold. The manager was called, she also explained that the food was prepared but waiting an ingredient! Then said "we are not a fast food outlet give us some love". Our problem was no one had informed us of the delay, and my partner had long finished his meal before I received mine. We should have been informed and also given the opportunity to enjoy our food together! Neither of us would have minded a delay in receiving both dishes! We are not at all happy with how this was handled.
4
We love this place, one of the best coffee shops around Siglap.Quality of the coffee like in Italy, sandwiches and other dishes delicious.Once you try this place, you will never go back to TCC, Coffee Club or any commercial franchises such as Starbucks!The only negative point and that's why we rated 4 stars but not 5: service time is way too slow! Might have to wait around 15mn in order to get your cappuccino! But at least you get the quality
5
Excellent coffee, the toasted almond latte is a must-try! Unlike the typical flavored drinks, this one does not have any artificial taste or chemical after-taste. It's not sweetened either, this is truly the first flavored coffee I like. Cakes are just ok though.
5
A great place to have coffee and a cake. The hot foot also looked good. Quiet during the week, but busy at the weekend.
3
Lots of drinks and sweets to choose from. If you like coffee, you should try out all types here. cool hang out place in a quiet residential area.
5
Enjoyed the visit. Good hangout place. Coffee and breakfast are worth the visit. Especially liked the roast almond coffee.
4
Good brewed coffee awakening you when you have brunch here. Come early as the crowd stream in and you have difficulty finding a seat.
Appetisers and quiches, tarts with Benedict sandwiches are choice that awaits to spoil you for a lazy Sunday brunch or breakfast.
4
If you are a coffee lover, you would appreciate this place. Aesthetically pleasing, great aroma, and they make fantastic latte art as well. We spend more than 3 hours there to relax and enjoy their coffee. A great place to relax and have a nice chat with your friends. The only thing is, I wish they have more space inside the shop. It is a bit difficult to find a table during weekends. But overall this is a nice place to be, highly recommended

My husband and I frequent Craftsmen Specialty Coffee quite a bit as we live nearby and my husband likes their coffee. Admittedly, the food is usually quite good but the service is average at best. On this occasion, however, the service was so poor that we will probably not return. One of the staff, in particular, was rude and gave us the impression that he was not interested in serving customers (although this should be his primary job since he is working in a cafe after all). We arrived at about 7.20 pm and it was a Friday night. There was only one couple dining there and they had already been served and one other man was waiting for his takeaway. We ordered 2 open sandwiches and waffles to be served later. There were 3 staff working - a girl who was in charge of making the food and 2 guys (regular staff) whose main job seemed to be building highchairs for children. I say this because that was what they seemed to prioritise.After we had placed our orders (which included a flat white), the guy who took the order proceeded to stock the shelves at the back of the store with packets of coffee. After doing so, he made the flat white for my husband. I commented that it seemed strange that he would choose to do something that was obviously not urgent, instead of making the coffee right away. The open sandwiches came, one at a time. We had already finished the first one before the second one was ready. This is understandably so because the girl was the only one making the food. The other guy was building the chair. The guy who took the order helped him in between taking orders. I couldn't help but wonder why they were so busy building the chairs especially when more and more customers started coming into the cafe. At one point, there must have been about 10 to 12 customers.What I am most upset about was the fact that the waffles did not come even after we had long finished our sandwiches. We did not ask about it at first as we did not want to stress the girl up. We could see her rushing about fulfilling the other orders that came after ours. However, at about 8.15 pm (at least 30 min after we had finished our second sandwich), I asked the guy whom we had ordered from about the waffles. At this time he was still building the chair. His reply was rather rude. He said, "I told your husband to tell us when he wanted the waffles. Since no one came to tell us that you wanted the waffles, how are we to know that you want it so it has not been made." I told him that we would like to cancel the order as my husband had a business call to take and we had already been at the cafe for close to an hour. I also said that we would like a refund. He seemed angry when he heard this and stomped off to the cash register to get the cash which he handed to me with impatience and a curt "thank you".I think the management of Craftsmen need to train their staff better. Firstly, serving staff need to know that their primary job is to serve. And they should do so with courtesy. Staff should check on their customer's orders and not expect customers to have to ask for their food. Secondly, members of staff need to learn to prioritise their work and help each other out. Building chairs when the cafe is full of customers and leaving only one person to do all the cooking is just not right. Thirdly, when a customer enquires about his order and you realise that something is amiss, it is only right to apologise and try to make it up to the customer. Being rude does not help matters.There are other cafes that serve equally good coffee, if not better, in the area, namely Penny University and The Dutch Colony. Those places are where we will be taking our business next time

Situated at the corner of the building in Siglap and relatively brand new perhaps. I came in with a group of friends yesterday in search for drinks and desserts to hangout on the Saturday evening. The cafe was crowded but seats were easily available. We ordered drinks and 2 desserts; Pistachio Choc Cake and Churros. Highly recommend the churros and definitely the best ive had so far. Wouldnt be complete without ordering my coffee. We stayed there for a couple of hours and had a great time
3
The place is quite small with a simple setting, but no problem in getting a table for 4 during lunch. Order and pay at the counter first then get seated and it took quite a while to get all the orders served one at a time, perhaps due to the lack of a proper kitchen on the premises. The food are well crafted for presentation and tasted good, but find the Burrito Pullpork Wrap and Brioche Sandwitch rather pricey at $15 for a casual eatery like this
5
We went to this cafe after a really heavy lunch, but the big piece of red velvet cake looked too good to resist! They serve the best red velvet cake in Singapore and it is a must try! However I didn't like their Himalayan tea, thus I do not recommend it.
5
The owners are friendly and beautiful. The food that I ate pull porked burrito is delicious and healthy, full of arvocado and veges. The place is nicely decorated
4
I went on a weekday morning during my day off but was quite surprised that the place was very crowded. Be prepared to join/share your table with other. Good place for good coffee and short chill.
4
Great taste, good choice for vegetarians also and so fresh and so yum!
Must try. yes the service is slow but the food just covers up for everything.
4
I popped in for breakfast one morning. I can certainly recommend one of their all day breakfast selections. I had brioche with poached eggs, and it was delicious and generous with 3 slices of brioche, ham, cheese and avocado as well as 2 nicely done poached eggs with a salad. The coffee is also good. Not the cheapest place though, my whole breakfast and coffee was $20.
3
Visited the cafe on a sunday morning. Crowd was average in the cafe when we reached. When we stepped into the cafe, we had no idea it was a free seating or please wait to be seated concept cafe. After standing at the entrance for a while we finally asked the staff who told us it was free seating (shouldn't the staff ask us first?) We sat at this table which was not cleaned up. Took them a while to come over and clean up the table.The place served quite a variety of breakfast from waffles to toast to your regular spread. I would recommend the waffle as it was crispy and tasted just right.However I waited 45 min for my food to be served. Checked with 2 staffs before they realised that they did not key in my order. The food came out in a jiffy after that. The staff kept repeatedly brought out food which my friends ordered and which were already served to us. Probably the cafe still needed better ordering management despite the number of staff that they had.But the good thing was that the manager did come around asking everyone hows everything and he did apologise for the earlier situation. That did help to ease some frustration off on a sunday morning. :
5
Tucked away off the main East Coast road is the Craftsmen coffee shop. It's not huge but it's usually possible to get a seat provided you are willing to wait a few minutes!Coffee is very good but where they knock it out of the park is the food. Really lovely cakes and croissants and their waffles are superb too.All in all, it's one of - if not the best - coffee shops in this part of town. Definitely definitely worth going
4
We were lucky that our host (our close friend) in Singapore lives at Siglap Centre which was surrounded with different restaurants.Just a few blocks away from where we live lies Craftsmen Specialty Coffee where she told us that their Ice Cream Sandwich is a must-try.We ordered After 8 flavor. It was very similar with Mint ice cream. It was delicious, thick, and the cookie was chewy. I wish we had time to try their other flavors. I guess I have another reason to go back to Singapore. :
4
Went on an early saturday before the crowd came in, service was acceptable, didn't have to wait too long. Overall food was good, coffee almond latte is great. Dessert is acceptably good too. A recommended venue for brunch if u have no where else to check out.
3
Siglap - fine (hence my overall scoring of 3). Bedok/Eastwood road - ridiculously poor service. If a customer is ordering food and, as the server, you know there is a wait of over 30mins, you tell the customer before they hand over their cash. (I waited 50mins for two poached eggs on a muffin FYI.) If a customer orders a coffee and a coconut water and you bring the coffee, they should not need to ask 3 times for the coconut water. If a customer tells you they have been waiting 45mins, it's safe to assume they have a) finished their drinks and b) are not happy - OFFER THEM A FREE DRINK! It's not rocket science. (...or is it??
5
I would like to summarize my first experience at Craftsmen in a couple of words...Breakfast after first bite: "yum!!". Fresh flaky croissant, eggs done just the way I like it (which indicates there is communication amongst the staff!), a very tasty recipe. Coffee after first sip: "hmmm..."Coffee after 2nd sip: "yessss!"I will be back for sure & tell all my friends too
