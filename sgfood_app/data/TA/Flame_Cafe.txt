The staff were attentive and kept asking if the soup should be refilled. It was easy to dine in and take the items to eat. It was also very delicious!!!!

It was a perfect lunch with my family from melbourne. Suitable for my baby girl too. Nice food and also the atmosphere. Staffs was very friendly and also very hwlpful to explain what are the menu.
5
The restaurant could use new songs with respectful lyrics as the ones being played were inappropriate for kids

We loved the wait staff. they are all lovely and great. food is above average but not exactly exceeding expectations. may return.
5
The food selection is just nice and the place is convenient. The waiters are all friendly and efficient. We received a warm welcome.
5
was here for my second time, bought my halal colleague here, and she like it a lot.. you can make your own pizza toppings and they have many flavour of meat choice . good place for halal gathering
5
Good place to catch up with friends. Variety of ingredient to choose from with the base price. Good service too and unique type of hotpot mookata style.
5
It was our first time at Flame Cafe and when we arrived the staff were welcoming. Our server, Luke was very articulate, attentive and assisted us with everything! I will definitely recommend Flame Cafe to other friends and family! Keep it up!

4 tier Pagoda BBQ w fondueThe Flame Cafe.Much hyped.3 tier price.Normal -$19.90Deluxe - $38ish w free flow seafoodSupreme - $more expensive than the above 2.My opinion - Its just OK. Go for the chicken stock or tomyum.The Mala soup have no body in it.For the fondue...i even wondered why its there? If u planning to dine,just choose the normal serving price $19.90.As the others,even with free flow of seafood,crayfish,salmon,scallops included,DO NOT. i mean it DO NOT go with any of the seafood option. None are fresh(almost vomited). But the others(meat veggies n whatnots) are ok.But i wont return again. 3.5/10Lest their serving staffs were very courteous. 7/10 for tha
5
Worth the price. I got the Supreme sets. The oysters were fresh. The baked oysters were yummy. I especially liked the mala soup. The fish fillets were also fresh. Did not get the make-ur-own-pizza coz I was too full. Drinks were also be esp the Thai milk tea and the dessert ice cream was nice. All worth the money really. Will come again for Sure
5
Felt very welcome with all the staff!!.. so friendly and efficient .. very memorable for me and my Husband. Keep it Up!!
4
Our first time here and overall is good. But more variety will be better and i think vegetables should be put on top of seafood.
5
Had an enjoyable dinner experience. Will definite return again . It will be good if there are more variety on the drink
5
went there for gathering with friends . glad that it is halal.. seafood is very fresh.. especially the crayfish! prawns was abit small thou. overall it’s good!
4
The basic package is already enough to fill your tummy. Very spacious and great for huge groups to have a meal together.Staffs are attentive and explains the dining mechanics well. But it may take a longer time for them to tend to you during the busy periods of lunch and especially dinner, but they act fast though so kudos to them!
5
Sat for the Supreme buffet package. Soup: Tom Yum & ChickenDip: Salted EggSeafood are all fresh, wide range of choices of food, salted egg dip is FANTASTIC. Which buffet actually serve you free flow thai iced milk tea? FLAME CAFE! fresh oysters was amazing. fat and juicy!
1
Order their premium buffet and submitted the a la crate order a few times. Only came ONCE. And it wasn’t even a complete order. When we ask the staff, they said still cutting and it never came at all. The buffet counter was messy and really looked dirty, cups still had soap on them. The entire place was worse than a hawker. Seats were cramp and tables were small that I didn’t even bother to chase the al crate order anymore as dining there was unpleasant. Waited forever for the pagoda because they ran out, and staff sent the wrong soup orders causing more delay. Pagoda concept was interesting but it doesn’t work. The grill took forever to heat and food took forever to cook. Soup was boiling like mad and steamboat became overcooked. Overall dining there was worse than eating street food in Bangkok.For the premium buffet we paid, we didn’t even get the seafood we ordered and should have just gone to mookata or steamboat establishments
1
The restaurant is Super unhygienic, dirty and service is Extremely slow. Ordered seafood buffet but many seafood items were out of stock. Spotted soap on glasses, totally unacceptable. I received numerous calls and WhatsApp message to get oustanding payment in the middle of night from them due to their mistake in billing. Utterly disappointed with their service. Will not recommend anyone to visit this restaurant.
4
Seafood are fresh, food not bad, a bit disapointed for the steamer, after a while it got a very stronggas smell, barbeque aluminmum foil get burn very fast, needs to bring the whole steamboat to change.Tomato soup a bit salty, pizza needs to wait for very long to cook.
3
It is a good deal to have a buffet steamboat that this price. However, the place is a bit small. After putting the pagoda steamboat on the table, there is no much space to put other ingredients. Table to other customer's table behind are very near and cram, especially when want to take another round of ingredients or drinks.The self making pizza corner is pathetic. Only one oven and take long time to queue. And need another 30mins to wait for the pizza to bake, Since need to take such a long time, I left my pizza in the oven and go back my table to eat the steamboat. However, when coming back, my pizza was taken by don't know who....Should have a server at the pizza corner to help to bake the pizza.3 stars given is because of the price and varieties of food. The environment, ambience and service are not up to there yet
4
For that price, the food and the service is justifiable. However, it'd be great if they can ready cooked food such as fried rice, mee goreng and fried finger foods. Nevertheless, still enjoyed my experience!
5
The little pizza making corner is actually really cool, and the four tier pagoda is a good buffet concept. The basic package of $21.90+ per pax on weekends is sufficient with fresh prawns, meat and veg available, along with free drinks and also ice cream.
4
employees there are quite friendly and helpful. choices wise there is a lot of processed food. variety for seafood good.
4
food was average but great staffs!
there are more choices
imo, get the $19.90per pax is enough.
the rest was just additional food u get when u order
2
Nothing to rave about. Food wasnt very fresh. Bad ventilation. The main entrance seating where the food was placed was very cramp.
5
My muslim colleague was overjoyed to now know that there is additional place for steamboat consideration!
4
Was attracted by the four-tier pagoda, and turned out to be extremely value-for-money and satisfying!
3
this took steamboat to a new level! might be a little pricey but might be just worth a visit if you're a cheese lover
2
The quality of food is average, the tables are too small to fit the pagoda pot and plates food that needs to be cooked. Moreover the space is cram because the tables are close to each other so it's quite difficult to get out for refills
2
Will I visit again? Probably not, unless they do some adjustments to their restaurant. The number one reason for my poor review of this restaurant (and I rarely have poor reviews) is simply because of the ventilation of the place. It was stuffy (partly also because I went there on a weekend). We felt the heat from 2 pagoda steamboats on both sides, the one on our table and the other couple's table (which was pretty close to ours as well). They're right about one thing though, to name the restaurant as flame cafe, because it sure was hot and I was sweating throughout. I'm sure they've thought about this as they installed portable fans all around, but frankly, those didn't help much. They should really consider the space layout of the restaurant as well because it was quite a turn off to squeeze through your way through every path with everyone crowding at the buffet area as their staff with their pushcarts to serve the seafood for those who have ordered the supreme buffet. (Was thankful we ordered the least expensive one that evening). The pagoda steamboat in itself was also a problem for us because the grilling tier did not cook as fast and as well as we thought and my partner refused to eat the chicken meat even when it has been on the tier for an hour. The dip, however, remained hot the entire time, but their taste of the salted egg yolk could seriously do wayyyy better. For me, I personally loved the top tier, where I got to steam the tiger prawns and they turned out juicy as expected. That was the only thing I could rave about after experiencing a few other steamboat restaurants I've been to. Their addition of har kow, siew mai and other dumplings to the buffet list was a good choice. However, they seriously have to consider including a pair of tongs for every selection. Firstly because it is only hygienic and it will reduce food contamination. Secondly, it is only considerate that the same tongs are not used for both beef and chicken, for our dear friends who do not eat beef due to religious reasons. The only other thing I enjoyed was their Thai milk tea. You can enjoy that endlessly, provided if you are patient enough to wait for them to top up the beverages and ice for you. The ice was running out almost instantly and the beverage didn't stay cold no matter how much ice you place because the drink that comes from the dispenser will be hot. Not to mention, a bigger glass would be good if your ice cubes are gonna be big and also, it will save people the trip of going to the drinks section again and again (and it really doesn't help that your place is already super cramped!).

Good selection of buffet items. Reasonably priced. Actually very flavourful soup stocks. Staff friendly.
4
The premium steamboat buffet is value for money. Free flow of mussels and crayfish. The salted egg dip is also tasty.
3
Food serving size is big but abit short handed. Overall service is still not too bad. Soup bases are good too! Seafood are fresh too!
2
Ventilation is poor. Service is bad with orders for item taking very Long time to arrive. Food is really so so with a lot of spicy items. Utensils look dirty too!
2
reached there late and yet my table is not ready at all. food took quite some time to arrive. had free flow of salad but wasnt inform when we arrived. know about it only when we are halfway eating. kept taking the wrong order too.

I ordered the Stripling Steak, medium rare. But turns up very well done. So asked to change, and end up 75% done, gave up and just eat.Steak is super bland and tough, I can't bring myself to finish them.My friends order the Seafood Pasta but very dry and tasteless.Salmon Burger was not any better!The salted egg fried chicken, you cannot taste any salted egg at all, just some yellowish paste! OMG it is really bad!I saw the website it is by this Chef Shawn, but the way the food is cooked, I do not think it is by any decent chef!The whole place made your clothing stink too, so if you go there for lunch, make sure you can change your clothing else when you go bad office, everyone can smell your BBQ body!All 3 of us concluded, we will not go back there again, ever

Was on the way to lunch at a nearby coffee shop when our eyes caught the big banner outside the restaurant promoting their lunch Special of Szechuan noodles for only $5.90. Decided to give it a try and also ordered the grilled rosemary chicken. No regrets... love the food here. Nice place with good food.
3
I personally think the food was average. The place was under staffed and sometimes it took a while to get the server's attention. I ordered 2 sets of the 4 tier hot pot for 8 pax. On hind sight, I think just ordering ala carte would have been better value for money - given my group had 2 kids, 2 grandparents and 4 adults. The server was not very helpful and didn't or couldn't make good recommendations. The buffet was not fantastic. It was an experience but it likely will not be repeated. And we smell of the place after we left.
2
Please don't try their steamboat especially the Seafood & Meat Combo. Was there with my brother to try it and was extremely disappointed. The combo cost $48.90 and the portion was pathetic. You have to pay for the soup base so that is another additional $10.90. Their service is not good and yet charges "service charge" of 10% amounting our total bill to $65.78. If you have nothing better to do, then pls go waste some $ there. Never gonna head there again

On a whim decided to go for breakfast with a business colleague and after an online search found the website that stated open from 8am. We drove over and arrived just after 9am but on walking in, found the place deserted. After wandering around for a while, we found a staff member in a corner with her feet up on a chair and chattering on her mobile. When she saw she simply waived her hand in a dismissive fashion in order to shoo us out...Lousy service attitude and a poorly run business. Dont bother wasting your time with this place...
3
Meat & seafood selection passé, vegetable selection was good and crisp, ice cream at buffet section was great. Cheese fondue was a disappointment
3
Came in with high expectation but the Chilli Crab Pasta was covered in overpowering salty dried shrimps & chilli
Unsure we want to try the pagoda tower ?
4
Nice new steamboat place in this area! Like the fact that there is free cheese top up - good for any cheese lover!
3
Waiting time for the food was quite long and the ventilation was quite bad.
Selection of food is quite a lot though.
3
Some of the food not fresh, vegetables n clam not wash thoroughly, should have some air ventilation system as is indoor.

Just went there in the afternoon to try out this 4 tier cooking: boiling, frying, cheese dip and steaming. The concept is ok and actually everything is quite standard until the cheese dip part where u can dip into the chesse andenjoy the chesse!. But other than that... really nothing fanatastic about it.Quailty of the food is average, like those normal street steamboat where the ingredient is not the freshest and the fishball taste weird, i.e the fishball is very firm.. too firm in fact that i find it strange.Anyway, this is my first and last try.. just to share

We went for the lunch buffet on a weekend and we chose the seafood and meat combo buffet. This cost us $30.90+ per pax. The refill for the buffet portion is so generous we almost could not finish our order. So do take note to put in 1 portion for each refill. It is not by number of pax portion. Food are fresh and huge variety of choices. They also serve ala carte menu like all day breakfast, pasta, western food etc. I will go back again to try the other food. The 4 tier pagoda is interesting especially the steamer.
4
Went for a weekday dinner at $29.90+. The food is decent with a few different variety of meat for BBQ. Chose tom yum and chicken for the soup. They were decent. However, the structure of the pagoda pot makes taking stuff from the soup pot a chore. The BBQ tier is at face level and as expected, me and my brother were hit with splatting oil on a few occasions. The 3rd tier is for dipping sauce and we went for "Spicy Mongolian" as it tasted unique and quite frankly, the other 3 (cheese, salted egg & chocolate) were not up to standard. There were about 4-5 staff around but don't think they can manage a full house. Staff were however helpful and friendly. It was a decent experience trying the pagoda pot but not one I will frequent for steamboat and/or bbq craving
3
Nice ambience and cafe style concept. Amazed by the looks of the 4-tier steamboat. However one of our steamboat takes forever to boil or heated up. Thus didn't like the experience. Free flow of drinks and Ice creams. But drinks runs out pretty fast before they send it back for refill. Spacious and air conditioned place

Overhyped. We had ordered supreme buffet combo.1)Service is poor. We had a hard time trying to get the attention of the service crew.2) we had filled the order chit but the orders for meat and seafood items took a long time to deliver. We had to get hold of the service crew to check on our order twice. We were told supreme combo has free flow of oyster and king prawns but after chasing for our order twice, other items had came but not our order for King prawn. We had to check with the service crew again which they took very long to deliver again. When they deliver our order for King prawns they did not serve the number of prawns we had ordered. By this time, we are tired of waiting for our orders
