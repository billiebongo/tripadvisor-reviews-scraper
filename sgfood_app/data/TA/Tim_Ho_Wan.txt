Visited for lunch, it‚Äôs a fairly limited menu, but the famous pork buns lived up to their billing. Very, very good.
4
For a casual and quick lunch with Dim Sum in Orchard area, Tim Ho Wan is very well located right behind Shaw Centre and it is usually relatively easy to get a seat. The food is always served well and the staff is trained.
4
A good place to eat if you are in a group of four or more and Dim Sum is your do do. The food is good and tasty. Expect noise and bustle, but do your own thing and it all worrks out. Value for money.

We had been on a mission to find the best pork buns in the Orchard Road precinct and we found them here at Tim Ho Wan. Crispy coating with sweet meat, we also loved the chilli oil dumplings. Amazing and wish we lived in Singapore so we could have them regularly.

Been to this restaurant quite a number of times. Highly recommend for the above Char Siew (BBQ pork dumpling) Bun and also many of their steamed dishes. Ask fellow Singaporean diners if you happens to be there, (if you are a foreign tourist), they will sure to help recommend the various nice dishes. I will recommend Spinach and pork dumpling, fried carrot cake, prawns or Char Siew (BBQ Pork) wrapped with Vermicelli flour & topped with their special soya sauce, Steamed Siew Mai (minced Pork mixed with prawns)dumpling, Prawns Dumplings, their soups are also nice. Many choices including deserts.
4
Overall the experience was positive. Highlights were the shrimp dumplings and the spicy pork dumplings. I also ate the vegetable and prawn dumplings which were good and a portion of vegetables which were average. Given the choice of places in Singapore I think this is somewhere I would do occasionally- but versus options in china town for dim sum and also hawker options and din tai Fung then it‚Äôs a good to do, not a must do

We visited their outlet at Katong 112. At 11 am, it is quite and no queue. Service is fast and food is piping hot. Their famous heavenly four are: BBQ pork buns, Fried turnip cake, steamed egg sponge cake and vermicelli roll with pig's lever. The Hong Kong style wonton noodle is also delicious. Four of us shared 10 dishes, which we could hardly finish all the food, at $15 per head only. It is much cheaper and greater value for money compare to Din Tai Fung. Highly recommend

New Years Eve and it was crowded, we waited for about five minutes and was seated.we had six dishes, the usual Dim Sum eats and the food was ok. My wife showed me a poster that siad, it is a Michelin Star eatery...but we found it to be lacking in taste. The seating was very cramped felt uncomfortable. Service was ok, Price wise, it came to S$34.25. Pretty Cheap
1
Heard lots is good story and read the review! It seems good.However, our visit wasn‚Äôt fantastic nor even near to comfortable dining. The staff were rude and they don‚Äôt care, too many staff and took them 20mins to take our order.When the food were served? The waitress just dump it on our table. Seriously? If I dine at the back street like at Hong Kong? I will accept it. This is a Michelin‚Äôs star restaurant? LOL..why is there a need of service charge? Food for thought!...Food is average and our mood wasn‚Äôt great to have it. Before you can finish your food? Waitress come to clear our plates..wth? Ok, just 1 try and go figure
5
Can't say it's the best dim sum, but it was the best in a long long while. The siew bao was good - I prefer the steamed version which this dimsum chain doesn't offer - and the cheongfun, chok cuon, glutinous rice and goji berry in othmanthus flavour jelly dessert very good.Crowded, but we were not rushed, and service was friendly. We didn't order our dishes at one go as preferred here, and instead ordered as we went. No dramas. Recommended
5
Read the review not so good for THW for Plaza Sin, just try it this early morning 9.00am (1st customer) haha, in fact is Good for us. Price sure is not cheap because is THW. Dim Sum serve very hot and very fast. üëç

Located at the popular and convenient Orchard Road and Scott Road intersection.
Tasty, good service and reasonable value especially weekdays for seniors.
Great for Chinese di sum brunch and lunch!
4
just my second time to dine at this particular branch and it really satisfied my craving for dumplings...food was well prepared and presented nicely...service crews were friendly.
5
I had a quick business lunch in Tim oh Wan and I had the best Pork bun I had never had and the din sim were excellent and so testy.
4
This is the second time I tried Tim Ho Wan
Different outlet but the food is still great
Love the Pork Bun, Siew Mai, Shrimp Dumplings
Will come back again

Very disappointed with food & service. Alarm bells should have rang when there was no long queue like there used to be. Tables very cramped - no gap between the next table, only thing stopping foods getting mixed up was the condiments making a mini divider. Didn't feel clean as floor was sticky. Service poor with dishes practically thrown on to the table. Out of four dishes the fried rice was tasteless & hard, radish cake soggy & tasteless, spicy & sour dumplings nothing special & wasabi salad prawn dumplings were ok. Sorry to say won't be returning
5
This is one of the best yum cha restaurants I've been to.We had the siew mai and bean curd which was to die for, and full of flavour.The fried carrot cake was a bit of a miss as it was very soggy and falls to pieces as soon as you try to pick up with a chopstick - however according to my Dad it isn't always like this.Reasonably priced for the quality
1
Was at City link branch of Tim Ho Wan for brunch with family today. Place was quite empty and staff were alright when step in the restaurant. Ordered dim sum and food came. Family tasted the fried carrot cake and found the dish tasted weird. It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tasted right cos it seemed like it had gone bad kind of aftertaste. Alerted the staff and the female waitress said will bring to kitchen to try. Waited for quite awhile, no response from the female waitress what action she will take. Thought she will come back to let us know the dish will be replaced or what or otherwise.Another female staff was pacing up and down our table, wonder what she was doing. Though there was a table with customers at one corner, why was she pacing around our table unless customers asked for her service; which we did not. Only till I asked her why then she stop doing that. Hope the management will look into staff services and food standard. Doubt I will bring any overseas friends to the restaurant though this was my third visit. Very disappointing experience
3
Met up with a friend for lunch and decided to have some dim sum...We proceeded to Tim Ho Wan as there was no queue at that time..We ordered the usual and all the dishes were excellent.The problem was that the two of us had to share a two-table space with two other strangers with a gap of about 1 inch between the two tables.The waitress when serving dishes or tea to the other table, did that from our side of the table which was extremely annoying and rude.And the worst was when they collect the used tissues or finished dishes for the other table from our side, as at times drops of water or bits of tissue drop onto our table while we were still eating.I have been to this restaurant several times but this was my first time experiencing such rude and unhygienic behavior as I usually come in group of 4 so never had to share tables.Food was excellent but service ???
5
We'd forgotten that Tim Ho Wan had opened in Singapore and came across it when we were out shopping one day. We'd already eaten, so decided to return for breakfast/brunch the following day. We ordered up big as everything on the menu sounded too good to refuse! Absolutely delicious ... every morsel. And their sour chilli sauce is unbelievably good, if they ever decide to bottle and sell it I'll be lining up for that alone
5
Very affordable dimsum! WIde range of yummy dimsum to offer. I love their sticky rice! THeir mango dessert with tapioca. I also love their pork siomai! Everything is my favorite!
4
very good yum cha, what did you expect from the tim ho wan brand. went for the usual char sui bao and chung fan. still at the high standard it is, but just not as good as in hong kong.
4
when I visited Plaza Singapura I was very excited to see this restaurant in Singapore. Having visited it in Hong Kong, I can only dream of the specialities I was going to devour into. We went at 12:15 and I was lucky as there was no line to enter. We were promptly seated and the food came quickly after. The baked pork buns were delicious and the gluten rice was another winner
4
We ate late, and the place was half empty by the time we rocked up.Still we managed to eat quite a fair bit in the last closing hour. The food was well cooked, the staff fast and efficient and the bill only came up to $40
3
Another Tim Ho Wan dim sum restaurant originating from Hong Kong has another outlet in Singapore - this time in Pacific Plaza. Don't get me wrong, the food is good - some say their dim sum is the best but there's plenty of restaurants that offer great dim sums.However, I'm not a fan of their famous char siu baked pork buns. Unlike the fluffy white baos these have a crumbly topping which imparts a sweet taste that contrasts to the filling inside. Also they've messed around with the spring roll adding egg white which gives it a rubbery texture
3
The food is generally very goodBut the problem is when the waiters bring you the food, they throw the plate in front of youI understand that it is a restaurant that has many covered,But a bit of attention and respect for the customers they are eatin
3
Restaurant now is not as packed as the early days post opening.Ordered takeaways which took 13 min. When we opened up to eat,discovered portions had shrunk so insufficient for adults.Staff were not properly trained to look after customers like in their HK outlets where tea was served to waiting clients.Customers should check their bill as here they charge takeaway buyers 10% service charge
4
It√É¬§s a very busy, shopping centre set restaurant, offering take-away as well. Good catering chairs and tables, relatively comfortable. The staff are very helpful for ordering the different Dim Sum that arrive promptly.The taste of the food is wonderful and leaves you wanting more.For me, a person that is "easy to see", the portions can be a bit small, and to eat yourself full will take a while as well as be a bit costly, but for a medium lunch on the go, Tim Ho Wan is perfect
4
Had dinner here tonight prior to the movies with my local friend.We shared and enjoyed six dishes:Bean skin with shrimp.Bean skin with prawn and shrimp.Char Siew noodle - yum!Chicken, mushroom and riceSpicy and sour dumplings - yum!Fresh lettuce with a really good sauce.This is a popular chain throughout Asia - certainly recommended for the taste and many choices
5
We were very lucky and did not have to wait long to be seated. We ordered way too much food, but made our way through our selection. The dumplings were delicious and we would highly recommend the baked bbq pork buns. The size of the steamed egg cake was a bit of a shock - it was a huge piece, light and tasty. If you decided to have a meal there - we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
5
Went for breakfast most mornings. Their dim sum selection is small but all so very tasty.Quick service and my only observation is you pay 60c for tap water which I think is a bit naughty.
4
Order their signature char Siew bun. Taste great no complaint service is excellent also will eat in next trip. Lots of people hence the takeaway.
5
This is a casual dumpling/dim sum restaurant across from the Marriott Tang Plaza. It is a must for lunch, snack or dinner. Fast service and reasonably priced.
3
The prices had a slight increase compared to my last visit to Tim Ho Wan. The Baked Char Siew Bao and the prawn Chee Cheong Fun is still the best!
4
I like Timhowan food's taste. My favourite foods are shrimp dimsum, dumpling, roll inside shrimp & soy sauce, and especially is cake salted egg. But remind order before go or go soon, because will have to line up at noon.
5
Very tasty food. Quick service and very affordable, must go if in the area! Pork buns delicious, rice rolls & of course dumplings. Fresh, subtitle, super tasty!
5
It's always a must to visit Tim Ho Wan whenever you're in Singapore. Michelin-starred restaurant at its best. Dumplings are tasty and perfectly cooked. Really delicious food and will always come back for more.
3
Went there after a movie. Not bad food at all.
Staff is little bit not that service minded. We haven't even finished eating and they were busy cleaning the table.
2
From the first visit when this restaurant opened in Singapore, a stark contrast could be seen just by looking at the line of queue outside the restaurant. The 5-10m line had disappeared now.Unfortunately it seemed that the probable cause of the dying popularity was the declining quality of the food.1. Yang zhou fried rice was bland.2. The vegetable fried rice was too hard, undercooked.3. The jelly fish salad lacked identityAs for the rest such as the siew mai, har gow, etc were very ordinary. Nothing stood out.Maybe it's a good idea for the brand owner to do some audit on the outlets to maintain the quality and consistency across the outlets?A couple of western tourists were seen with their travel booklet ordering dishes which were recommended by the writer of the travel book.Hopefully they were not disappointed by their experience
2
Been patronising Tim Ho Wan for sometimes since it's open in Singapore, although THW In Singapore not as nice as the original place in HK. But now after they changed their menu (no more beef ball also rice with beef and egg) to lesser options, I Guess I need to find another dim sum place to eat. BBQ pork bun and lesser selection for Chee Cheong Fun not a strong reason to come back to THW anytime soon. No wonder it was no queue during weekends at Toa Payoh branch, indeed only few (<5) tables occupied
5
Excellent dimsum as always.
Wish they would provide Chinese mustard as a condiment.
Eat too much. Need to go on diet after going to this place.
3
So recently I had a very pleasant experience at the Pacific Plaza branch and when I was in the vicinity of Plaza Singapura, I decided to stop by for lunch for the dim sum that delighted me.Alas, the standard was not the same. This round we ordered Congee, Beancurd Skin with Pork and Shrimp, Spinach Dumpling and Vermicelli Roll with Pork.The century egg in the congee tasted off and for the congee itself instead of a fragrant taste of the other branch this turned out almost bad. The flour of the vermicelli roll was overly soft it was limp and a let down. The spinach dumpling was good and the beancurd skin was not bad.Environment wise the Pacific Plaza branch is my preference too. The Plaza Singapura branch looks older, is more squeezed out and offers a less pleasant dining experience. I won't rush to visit this branch again
3
This is a typical Hong Kong Style dim sum place. Service is efficient and robotic to turn around customers quickly, dishes are standard 3-pieces that cost between $4 to $6, with a few signature items (BBQ Pork Buns) that make you keep coming back for more. If you missed the nosy in Hong Kong's dim sum places, this would be nostalgic for you. For small eater the cost per head is between $15 to $20. All the dishes are tasty and freshly prepared. Great for Sunday morning family gathering, if you like Dim Sum
4
This casual dim sum restaurant has earned one star from Michelin Guide. You need to try their Baked BBQ Pork buns to know why. Expect long snaking queues during peak hours especially at Plaza Singapura branch and elbowing for food at the tables too. Service is always prompt and quick across the branches I have eaten at.This place has elected several dishes as their ÂõõÂ§ßÂ§©Áéã or simply The Four Heavenly (dishes), which is the Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Egg Cake, Pan Fried Carrot Cake and Cheong Fun. I have been a THW patron since its opening in Singapore and sad to say, though the dishes taste awesome same till now, the prices has not, it's risen by at least 15-25%.
5
My husband had never had a chance to dine here, so I took him along. He and I have lived in Hong Kong for many years and are no strangers to dim sum. He used to eat at the China Club every week. So far the dim sum in SG has been so, so. He kept on saying "this is really good" and then at the end when we paid, the cheap price was really a bonus.Also their staff is really nice and friendly - something rather unusual in SG
4
Of course you're here for the Baked BBQ Buns. Tim Ho Wan has great buns! but(t) don't be boring challenge yourself with some innards - Marinated Crispy Pork Intestine. Go ahead. Good casual dinning options. Has long lines during peak hours but if you come before 12.30 or before 6pm you'd get a seat quickly.
3
Had always wanted to visit Tim Ho Wan and try the Michelin Star offerings. Its good but not great. Am sure that the Original one in HKG stands out. I went to the 112 Katong outlet on a weekday evening and it was deserted. So my order did not take time and the Sour and Spicy dumpling was the star for me. Rest of the items were pretty normal and i can easily forget them. If its some expensive Dim Sums that you want, head here else it can be given a miss
2
Had been here sometimes ago, just disappointed the place are so noisy and narrow, imagine you could nearly mix up your dishes with next door customer.No matter how good is your food, the environment also play a part, which let people feel comfortable and got privacy, but the concept of this restaurant are wrong.Will not go back again unless improvement on their environment although the food is acceptable
5
We went here after a recommendation from our Lonely Planet book and it was well worth it. We did not like Orchard Road but this restaurant made our day! Good choices, especially for pescatarians - the menu highlights which foods have meat in which i always appreciate! If there is queue don't be put off, it disappears quickly, especially if there are just two of you. Great prices too! Would definitely recommend
1
Went here on positive recommendations and because Michelin star was mentioned. They indeed have all kind of articles on Michelin on the wall, but that applies to the one in Hong Kong it seems. Our experience was just bad. Very unfriendly staff, food was mediocre at best and the place hasnt much atmosphere. Also, they serve hardly any drinks. We should have been warned as there was a fence to control the waiting line, but no-one was waiting. Place probably has seen better days. Much better to go to foodcourt at Wisma on the other side of the road one mrt stop further (somerset / orchard)
5
Had lunch there . tried the pork bun ,was so tasty I took two extra portion back to the hotel . the rest of the dim sum were good . just make sure to try the BBQ pork bun and enjoy it
5
Absolutely delicious dumplings. The pork buns are ridiculously tasty. Their food is a must for any foodie, and the takeaway window makes it so easy.
4
This is a very famous Chinese Restaurant. You should try the Dim Sum in variety menus. The porridge is also good too. Please visit before the lunch or dinner time. If not, you have to wait for a long time.
3
I have patronised the outlet at Toa Payoh, Lavender and Katong but personally I think the main brance at Plaza Singapura is least impressive. The food is less tasty for some reasons, I will not go there again but other branches especially Katong is nice
3
Foremost, if you don't benchmark your review against HK, Spore and Malaysia standards of dim sim, your reviews could be as wide as an ocean Most locals would give this 3 stars or 2 (for poor service). most foreigners esp. from countries which does not have sizeable cantonese restaurants would think of 4 stars and great dim sims here.Given my local benchmark it is only 3 stars for many dishes. Cheong fun is a bit skinny and baked bbq buns are laced with sugar and not that good a population that has increasing incidences of type 2 diabetics.Just average and pricy, with the GS
1
My worst dim sum experience in Singapore. Prices of dim sum expensive and sittings are not as comfortable as competitors. Food came out cold inside and it was not properly heat up. It doesn't deserve a Michiglin Star. With branches in every corners we cannot expect tasteful handmade dim sum, not surprisingly made from central kitchen. There are many choices in town, Crystal Jade and East Ocean etc
4
A Dim Sum joint like no others, a chain with multiple locations in Singapour which all offers same products with an inspiring consistency! No alcohol is served there but the homemade barley drink is delicious and refreshing. Initial Concept consists of small plates of chinese snacks such as dumplings, congee, Rolls... which costs around 5$ each. I have been many times (also in Hong Kong where it is from) and never been disappointed so far! I like the take away option so I bring back home a taste of THW for the next day.. Service is efficient, diner style, with bill to be paid at the counter, small tables, very close to each other, noisy, plenty of locals, seafood, pork, begetarian options available, original desserts...Great place to enjoy excellent food at a descent price in Singapour
3
They advertise themselves as one of the best places in town, so I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t resist entering. It was a quite hour with few people around, so the servants took their time. When I finally could order, I took two dishes. The taste was very good and I will certainly come back another time. The service is slow and although they had a Wi-Fi signal, they were not willing to give the access code, quite old fashion but on the other perhaps it is better to concentrate on the food
1
Its my 2nd time dining in this restaurant and seriously what a great difference in the service and the standard of the food. I was actually looking forward to have the char siew bun which i feel that its delicious when I first tried it few years back when the restaurant is just open. From the moment I was being seated to my table up till the food standards, the whole experience is thrashy. First, I dont know whose or what concept you are following for the seating arrangement, having sharing tables with not even a small gap in between two parties that dont even know each other. Maybe should ask any of the staffs to try, sit there sticking so close to someone you havent seen before and having our food together like some kind of friends or family. Its very UNCOMFORTABLE and RIDICULOUS. A server even has the cheek to tell me that all their tables are for sharing when I asked for our table to be separated. I cant believe it, is that how you all are doing all the way to make your customers comfortable? Then, im sorry to say that its pathetic.. Before you just throw any people or customers to share a table ,pls have the courtesy to ask if we mind or not. If your restaurant does not have enough table, you cant just cramp everyone together sit side by side. Yes you might think that you dont want to reject business, you wana tk as much customer as you can, but whats the point if your customer end up walking out of the restaurant unhappy.. Customers will end up losing their mood to eat there, end of the day they wont ask to order more because they just wana get out of the cramp and uncomfortable space. And your char siew bun was not hot, just a little warm, not crispy and feels like its either been left out there for a while or the chef simply didnt cook it properly. Im not going back there any more. And if these kind of things continues and you all dont bother to improve, then i believe i wont be the only one customer that you will just lose
3
Took lunch here on my way to the National Museum of Singapore. They have very limited items on their menu which is placed in paper on top of each table. I think there were less than 30 items on the menu.The restaurant is always packed but food is quite average and a bit expensive for such small servings. I ordered their only noodle dish on the menu which was a spicy prawn noodle and their Spinach with shrimp dumpling. Except for the noodles which was a bit salty , their dumpling was OK
5
Always go there for a quick lunch on my own or with friends. Very fresh Dim Sum, prawns, or prawns and spinach. Simple but excellent. The restaurant has one Michelin star in Hong Kong. It is very popular with Singaporeans, hardly any tourists.
4
It's a very nice Chinese Restaurant in the centre city, Orchard Road. All of Dim Sum Menu (Hing Kong Style) are great and got Michelin Star. You have to come early to get your seat. (If not, you have to wait for a long time.)
2
Was very disappointed with the lack of choices. Have never been to a tim sum restaurant with so few varieties. Nothing special compare to other restaurants serving tim sum. BEWARE they checked you for WATER.
2
Brought our visitors from Australia to try at this outlet for comparison to the one we visited in Sydney mid last year. This place was crowded and noisy and there was a queue. Even their famous bun was not good at all. We had almost identical items as were in Sydney and more but was totally disappointed here. The lotus leaf glutinous rice lacks fragrance and nothing much other than the glutinous rice. The steam chicken rice's chicken doesn't look like it was properly cooked. The century egg congee were so "watery" other than the wasabi prawn fritter just passable. We ordered more than a dozen items for our party of 5 and almost all were disappointing. For sure will not return to this place again, it's just over-rate
5
Compared to Hong Kong, the dim sum served here were a tad expensive. However, the quality of the food is as good as it's Hong Kong outlets. I especially love the polo buns! They are to die for! Service was average, there was no sign of putting extra effort in making us feel comfortable
1
Was at Tim Ho Wan I12 Katong last night. I don't know what the fuss about this restaurant. There is nothing much or fancy on the menu. The food tasted rather bland. Usually, I won't not even have to dip soya sauce or chili sauce into my Har Kao ( Prawn Dumpling ) but had to do it at THW, not sure if they had don't any quality control on their food stuff. But will definitely not recommend to friends and am not going back even if I have strong craving for prawn dumpling
5
Yum! We tried in HongKong last year and luckily discovered there is now a restaurant in Singapore. You can either dine in or there is a takeaway part on the outside of the building. If you do nothing else sample the pork buns, so good to eat
2
Was disappointed with the choices of Tim sum that was available. Not the usual style of tim sum. No trolleys going around could it be lack of space? The only dishes available were on the menu. Very very limited dishes, lack of choice. My first and last time going to Tim Ho Wan
2
This place usually has a 1 hour Q to get in at weekends so we thought that we'd lucked out when we saw a 15 minute Q.It is the authentic Hong Kong TWH experience - by that I mean you are given a menu whilst waiting and told to tick your chosen dishes to speed the service time up, the food is then slapped down in front of you whenever it's ready by waiting staff that then ignore you.The pork buns are Super tastyEverything else is utter slop.AVOI
3
THW came with a big bang with crazy long queues. Now that it has settled a bit, I took the opportunity to try at Plaza SG. Seriously, it is nothing to crow about. One big disappointment is that being a HK brand restaurant, it does not serve "chilli with oil". which HK restaurant does not have this condiment? and the chili that is served is sweet and salty and not one bit spicy. Other similar establish have the chili oil so i do not understand why THW does not. However, i am told that other branch might have. ?? . Another blunder from THW .. the menu as written in English states "Dried Fish with Peanut porridge" however, this came with Pork. Isn't this misleading? The Chinese inscription did indicate pork but the English did not. I do not read Chinese and i am sure there are others of the same. Overall, it was disappointing. The food was just normal and does not surpass establishment like Imperial Treasures. Better go to the one in HK
4
This place could be very crowded at lunch or dinner. But the service is fast, the quality is good. The bbq roast buns are excellent, my favorite.
3
Feel that their food is not worth the queue. Had Siew mai, Har gao etc but they are just too much seasoning and doesn't taste up to expectation
3
The pork bun is good. Rest is average. Oh the lotus rice is good as well. I have this at plaza singapore. Other branch i am not sure.
5
Been here twice since getting to Singapore. The pork buns are just outstanding. Just discover the place yourself and enjoy what is on offer.
5
Not familiar with most of the items on the menu I let my Singaporean host order a selection. Great tastes I discovered and friendly service!!
3
I was here for an early lunch with my four year old granddaughter who is a dumpling expert!At eleven we were seated without delay and our order was promptly delivered and tasted delicious.However this is not a relaxed environment, the tables are cramped together and eating is purely functional rather than a pleasurable social experience
4
I took my family to celebrate my daughter's passing her CPA exam at Pacific Plaza. The queue at Kam's roast duck and Tsuta Ramen was super long on Sunday night. Luckily, our favourite dim sum restaurant-Tim Ho Wen, has opened a new outlet there for 1 moth.
3
Not impressed. Food , nothing out the common . Just standard . And this from Hong Kong !! Basic things like carrot cake poor quality and standard , anywhere in Singapore selling Dim sum make a much better and nicer carrot cake ! Egg tart .... same thing . Prices overblown, and misplaced arrogance 
5
My local friend suggested dim sum at Tim Ho Wan (Pacific Plaza outlet Scotts Road)We were not disappointed - we ordered the following dishes:Beancurd Skin Roll with ShrimpPan Fried Radish CakeBeancurd Skin with Pork and ShrimpBaked Bun With BBQ Pork (Just the best - far better than steamed Pork Buns)Spicy Prawn Sauce Char Siew Stew NoodleLettuceTaro Coconut Milk with SagoGreat service, friendly service - we enjoyed every dish - we will be back...this restaurant chain is well recommended
5
My friend works nearby your outlet at 112 Katong. I didn't have a good impression with Tim Ho Wan, except for your pork buns. But this outlet totally changed my perception of you. The staffs here are friendly and genuine. They have ensured that they give personalised service and that's something rare in Singapore
4
Its hectic but service is quick. I like the buns in particular and the carrot cake. May have to queue but price is not that cheap afterall
5
Food is excellent. I suggest the spinach, mushroom and shrimp dim sum. Steamed prawn is also good. Crowded so prepare to wait early mornings
4
We went in the night . Shift changing time . 2200hrs .Had to just understand the China staff ;there was no delay in service . Dim sum excellent The stuffed bun was excellent too .chicken were good too .in summary Hong Kong or Cantonese food credit to the organisation -branches in china too There are other branches in Singapore to
3
Celebrated my good friend's birthday here. We had dinner on a week day but it was full house. Grateful that the queue moves very fast so that we did not have to wait very Long for a table. The century egg porridge was very smooth and delicious. We ordered quite a few dim sum and most items come in a plate of three. The egg tarts were sumptuous. There was also quite a few dessert to choose from the menu. You could also request that the dessert be served after the main course. We had quite a lot to catch up as we last met in February and my good Friend just came back from Perth. The ambience was great and the food was sumptuous. I would recommend this to my classmates and family
4
Always stop there when I can in Hongkong so to have one in Singapore is a bonus . I will say that the chicken feet were better , same for the rest of the dishes I had . My favorite is the congee with preserved eggs and chicken . I think too many people used to it now so it will be nice to see a change on the menu ! Also many other places do fantastic dim sum like Din Tai Fung
4
I was attracted by the accolade (One-Michelin-Star) of the restaurant and decided to give it a try when I was around the vicinity of the restaurant. I ordered the standard dim sum dishes: Pan Fried Radish Cake, Shrimp Vermicelli Roll, Prawn Dumpling, Pork Congee with Century Egg, etc. To me the best dish is the Pork Congee which was really very delicious and I can't imagine any other congee that can be better than it. However, I would rate most of the other dishes as between 3 to 4, with 5 being the best. Another negative point is that it is very pricey! I can get dim sum that is around this quality in many places in Singapore and Malaysia. You can easily find cheap and excellent quality dim sum in HK
5
Can it get a michelin star like that of H Kong? I think yes. I could not leave singapore today without tasting their dim sum. Note however the long queue before you get a table. The baked pork buns are simply killers. The crust is divine just like the filling sweet and fine.

I never thought I'd give Tim Ho Wan a review but after going there for supper snack at 10pm at the Asperia Kallang branch (for 3 consecutive Saturday nights ) which opens till 3am, I must give it a good review. I've my favourite snacks such as the roasted bun with char siu. Almond soup. Stewed bean curd. The prawn dumpling is so so. They charge 60 cents for water. For dim sum in the middle of the night. Excellent. For afternoon dim sum at a more leisurely pace, Crystal Jade, Imperial Treasures at Great World City is better especially with the rush and it's brand name. Service is good and very prompt but the place is cramped. One Michelin star? I'm no expert on dim sum but the Singapore branch quality is not better than Imperial Treasures. If you've friends with SICC membership, dim sum is cheaper and better than Tim Ho Wan Singapore.  Brilliant move to open at night. Patrons are less hurried.

News says it's a michelin star restaurant in HK. Maybe it's just a news. Tired several 5 dishes, and only the spinach dumpling is acceptable. Other are rather mediocre in flavor and presentation. Maybe not one of my favorite restaurant. Service is also lack of attention. Had to look for staff several time for assistance.

Had a late dinner here last night around 9 pm. They were closing at 930 pm but the staff did not pressure us to order, eat quickly and leave.We had the signature crispy pork buns, which were very good. The char siew cheong fun was a little overcooked, but was okay, while the glutinous rice was not enjoyable, being too sweet and sticky. The siew mai was tasty and the wasabi prawn wontons were also okay.Must say it was okay, though a pale comparison to the ones in Hong Kong
3
Expect a quality and true authentic HK dim sum from this restaurant. But, it's just an average dim sum joint with tastes hardly match the ones in HK.
5
This place has been one of my family's favourite Dim Sum restaurant since I was small. There's this authentic distinct taste that Tim Ho Wan offers that you can't find in any other Dim Sum restaurant. Must try: Baked Bun with BBQ Pork
5
Thursday at 6 pm we walked right in 2 persons without any reservation. Otherwise a reservation is recommended at this place because of it‚Äôs popularity.
The food was great as expected.
The tables are very close to each other, so private talk is not possible.
1
They forgot my water and didnt seem that busy. They refused to refund me one item that was 15 min late to serve. I told them I would write a poor review and they didnt seem to care. Small portions for the price. Decent ingredients and taste but too hot at over 40 Celsius steamed and being served in a nice bamboo dumpling dish. Over 12$ sgd with tax and GST for 2 appetizers. Not worth it and poor service. They blamed it on the kitchen and chefs.

@TheKuoKnowsIf you are after some lightening-fast dim sum, then Tim Ho Wan is the place for you. The wait for a table might be a bit long at peak times. So try to avoid lunchtimes. The food does get from kitchen to dining table in double-quick time, though.The quality of the dim sum is acceptable. It may not be some of the finest in Singapore. But it does the job, if your body is telling you that you are badly in need of a Har Gau-fix.Instead of the more traditional Char Siu Bao, Tim Ho Wan serves Char Siu Buns. It's ok, if you like glazed baked dough rather than the more traditional fluffy steamed variety. A change is as good as a rest, as some might say.The Cheung Fun tends to be a little on the thin side, which is ok if you don't like a whole lot of rice-flour pastry. The Fried Carrot Cake was substantial but it could do with a tad more savory ingredients to bring out the flavour.On the whole, Tim Ho Wan does a reasonable job. It is convenient; it is not overly expensive and it is, unquestionably, very fast - perhaps a bit too fast at times
4
I have been to Tim Ho Wan at Plaza Singapura many times, at least once a month and I always am satisfied with their food and service. Their service staff is fast, efficient and attentive in seeing to the customers' requests. Well done, keep it up
3
The brand made a splash when it first opened in Singapore and the queue was long. Now there are at least three to four of them coming up to capitalise on the popularity but craze is over. The issue is that the food is not that different from the other non branded HK style dim sun place in Singapore at all. I was told that only the original one in HK is worth a try
4
I went to Tim Ho Wan on a Singaporean friend advice. The menu is basically Chinese style. I ordered pork congee, pork noddle soup, and baked barbeque pork buns. As a side dish some dimsun (small dishes) like beancurd with pork skin and shrimp siew may. The menu is pleasant
5
We went to Tim Ho Wan for lunch on recommendation of a local Singaporean. It didn't disappoint. We had a really great lunch. Don't miss the pork buns - delicious! Well worth it. You will find Tim Ho Wan in a number of locations. If you come across one, try it.
5
Great restaurant! The dimsum menu is not as varied as some other restaurants but all of the offerings are solid at worst and heavenly in some cases (bbq pork buns and chicken sticky rice!)You often will find a long queue, but Tim Ho Wan is amazingly fast at turning tables and so I've never waited more than 15 minutes for a table. That being said, the staff are extremely efficient and food starts arriving almost instantly upon order so this is not the place to go if you are looking for a leisurely dinner. All in all, my husband and I love going here for a quick, delicious bit to eat. We are never disappointed with Tim Ho Wan. There is also a take-out counter at this branch, so you can pick up your BBQ pork buns to go :
5
Wonderful dim sum. We ordered dim sum with shrimp, spinach prawn dumpling and a sort of pig liver cannoli. The biggest surprise were the spinach dumplings. Great balance of spinachi, garlic and prawn..
1
By recommendation we had dinner in the Singapore restaurant. We both got food poisoned...
Hence being biased a food review is hard to give but one word sums it up. Sweet. Most of the dishes are sweet, bordering sugar rush sweet.
3
We went to Tim Ho Wan cos we wanted a nice dim sum. Actually we found the dimsum is quite standard at this Kallang branch. Nothing special. However, service was fast despite of very busy and crowded night.
4
dim sum were fresh and tasty, portion is huge and overall experience was great.
Definitely, value for money and will frequent this place again.
5
Our first time here and managed to get a table for three rather quickly amidst a packed crowd. Friendly waitress recommended some of the favorites here. Baked bbq buns are a must while laksa wonton are for those that like some local spice twang. Ordered the pork liver rice roll (great taste n smooth), chicken feet (excellent) spinach dumplings with dash of garlic n spring rolls with egg white (so so). All in all, interesting offerings from Michelin starred chef. Prices reasonable.
5
Great food experience was expected in a place boasting Michelin star appraisal. And it was there. Pork buns like nowhere else, chicken feet melting in mouth and I still cannot forget their laksa. Well done and I wish I did not have to go thaaaaaaat far to get some great food
2
It is 3pm and we decided to go a tea-break. It was the worst tea-break ever. We ordered the Pork & Scrimp Siew Mai which was salty. The carrot cake was disappointing, mushy and tasted salty too. Only the Baked BBQ Pork Buns tasted good. One service staff push the chair next to me without lifting the chair and it gave out a horrible screeching sound. What a disappointment!Rating 2/5 I am never coming back here again.
3
I managed to try this restaurant because it was no queue, while it always Long queue, so I was in a good timing :)For dim sum, it was same to other dim sum restaurant, the bun with pork is most popular, and yes, it's nice They miss out my order of noddle and I can't be bother to ask them My rating is good, but since there no good option in this review, I gave average.
4
I brought my Korean friend here with trepidation (as I've tried the Tim Ho Wan in Jurong East - was not good at all and HK - sporadic quality). I was glad there wasn't a line. Which is good for me. We sat down and ordered. The food came quickly enough. Everything seems fresh enough and hot. Which is great. Guess what? the taste is equally good! I was surprised! And very happy about it. We ate everything on the menu. Everything was good. Thank you, Tim Ho Wan for not disappointing
4
I had lunch with 2 of my colleagues here yesterday. We arrived at around 12.30pm and there was a short queue, but it moved fast and we were seated within 15 mins.We ordered quite a lot of items including the Cha siew bun, liver chee cheong fun, cha siew chee cheong fun, laksa dumplings, har kow, siew mai, pan-fried radish cake, century egg porridge, etc.The Cha siew bun here is still the best I had had. I have yet to find a better one in Singapore. Other dishes worth a mention are the liver chee cheong fun which is unqiue to this restaurant and the laksa dumplings which is this months special. It is actually chives dumplings in laksa gravy. Quite an interesting dish.Together with 12 takeaway dumplings for our colleagues back in the office, the meal for 3 of us cost S$100. We had so much food we had no more room for dessert
4
Sumptuous Lunch. If you have time to wait in the long queue it's worth the wait. Their warm barley is indeed one of the best I had. The siew Mai is fantastic and the noodles is mouth watering indeed.
5
This was the best pork buns, prawn dumplings and spring rolls we have ever had. Amazing compared to what you would get in Australia. Quick service and polite staff, and reasonably priced. A must experience.
4
Just had dinner at Tim Ho Wan with family at Jurong. For the price of the food. Worth it. Go for carrot cake, siew mai and porridge. Nice and quiet weekday. No queue nowadays as many outlets open in Singapore.
4
Pork BBQ Buns, Pork BBQ Buns & more Pork BBQ Buns please!!! Get it! A must try also is the Bean Curd with Chicken and something roll & the Beef Tendon Noodles! Woooowww!
4
The signature char siew bun is a must try as it is different from the usual bun. There is a wide variety of dim sum to choose from. They serve desserts too.
4
If you're looking for a quick dim-sum place without the hassle of queuing...this is the place to go to. But if you're interested in having a bowl of the best collective Congee (concoction of pork, century and salted eggs) and a single serving of 3 portions of Fried Pork Bun, then look no further :-)
4
Being a Dim sum lover, in my life I have never and the word I used is NEVER praised any restaurant, stalls or establishments to have the best Har Kow. One day I went to their Branch in Lavender since I do not to fight with the crowd, and I went there late dining cos they open 24hrs. I would say this branch had so far not disappoint me for their Har Kow they served. Unfortunately, their branches in Plaza Sing and Gateway, serve mediocre quality Har Kow. Their signature items is their Char Siew bun, can't miss it
4
Stopped by at the Westgate outlet for a quick snack with a friend. Service was prompt. It is rather no frills- write your order on the piece of paper provided and we did not wait long for the food. All the items we ordered were good -Porridge, Siew mai ( pork dumplings) and the pork buns were good. However, there is no chance to linger around longer for a chat. Better to make way for the next customer in queue
5
Pork pork pork!!! Everything pork and shrimp is beyond words here.. It's a must try if you are in Singapore. Not only because its a Michelin Starred Chefs restaurant but because it's a whole different experience which is totally worth it.. There is a queue to get in but it's saved up on the time you have to order because they give you the menu to order while you are outside it self which makes the whole process faster. Definitely coming back here when I visit Singapore again!
3
Even though this is a 1 michelin star restaurant with supposedly authentic Hong Kong food fare, I found it appalling as the taste is not even close to the real mccoy that I tried in Hong Kong.also, I do not see the need for the queue as the waiting time can be up to a few hours
3
Having steamed spinach dumpling, steamed seasonal vegie, and beef balls. Just average. The place itself is very full.
4
We visited for the pork buns, which were served warm and very yummy. Just wish we'd got a takeout rather than sat in to avoid the service charge and the staff who obviously didn't want to be there.
5
This was my eating highlight in Singapore. The pork dumplings are amazing as are the other dishes I tried.
This cafe is located right at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT so it is very easy to find.
4
Came here for their famous pork buns but although the crust is amazingly tender and flaky, the filling was too sweet for me. The Carrot cake was bland and so was the vermicelli roll. Why the very good rating? because food here is moderately priced. and for the price, the Peking Duck Rolls, Congee and Dumplings redeemed this restaurant. The service was fast and just as excellent as it was in a more pricier Chinese restaurant we visited the day before.This will definitely on our must eat list
4
We tried the new menu Smoke Melon Roll, it was a good choice, something different with unique taste. We also tried the favourite pork bun which is always perfectly cooked. Others food is also well prepared. Service is very quick and with typical old days chinese restauran
4
Ate at the HK branch a while back, and loved it. He's expanded the operation dramatically in the past few years, so a lot of the "wow" factor has been sacrificed owing to needs. However. Still fresh, still fantastic and high quality ingredients, and great friendly staff. After just a few days of breakfast visits, we were greeted with smiles and 'nice to see you again', which is always a buzz in a foreign city! Good prices, dependable quality.
3
We thought we might try a different dim sum place other than our favourite. We had to line up, whilst in line we where given the menu to order on. Honestly, nothing really grabbed me as being amazing. We did choose the recommended BBQ buns and a few other pieces. As we where a couple we where seated quickly. However when seated I was literally on another mans lap in the back in what seemed to be an old office or private room. Im ok with close but this was really close. Not sure if this is worth the hype in a city with so much competition, especially from Din Tai Fung
5
I like to try dim sum and I found the perfect spot to do it - TomHoWan! great choice of various foodies, nice service, reasonable pricing even for Singapore.please note that you will be seated at common tables and with limited privacy, but while you anyway visiting this place to enjoy the food and you can have a lovely chat with strangers..
2
Most of the time we go for new experiences and new tastes. We actually went inside and sat down, but after checking the menu a bit closer and looking at the tables around, there is just nothing "good" on the menu.I'm sure a lot of people like it, but to be honest - its ugly and I'm quite sure tastes like it looks. Went to Sushi place close by and it was like a day and night difference
4
Visited this particular branch of Tim Ho Wan quite often because it is very near to where I live.The service is always prompt, the food served piping hot and adequately cooked. The flavors and portion sizes are just right and very authentic.The only issues I'd have are their seasonal items, which tend to be a hit and miss. Items that are especially created to try to recreate Singapore flavors tend to flop more often than not, such as the Laksa Wanton (where the 'laksa' soup is too watery) and the Chilli Crab Taro Ball (where the chili crab filling is overwhelmed by the sweet fried taro pastry shell.)Definitely good to come back constantly for authentic dim sum, I think I'll just avoid the seasonal items for now
4
Visited this Michelin star restaurant for lunch with colleagues. The ambience is average but service and food it real good. It offers variety of food from mainland China.
5
If you want to skip queue, order for take away it will save you a lot of time. Chicken feet and the pork bun is the family favourite. Ate here many times.
3
The baked bbq pork bun is delicious. So are the siew mai n har kao. However the choice are limited and they hv only 1 congee in the menu. Should increase the menu selection
3
This is a michelin one star restaurant. It sells Chinese dim sum. It is pretty expensive and it does not have a nice dining atmosphere. Be prepare to queue up for a seat.
5
I was glad to know that Tim Ho Wan opened spots in Singapore and 68 Orchard Rd was my obvious choice after strolling along that street doing some window shopping and a bit of a real one.At about 14.30 there was no line at all as well as no particular noise (it is ridiculous to expect silence and relaxation from a cheap shopping mall eatery).IT IS A MICHELIN STAR (AND MICHELIN QUALITY) DIM SUM JOINT!!!And I agree with those who love Char Siew Bao - it is not steamed but baked and that's what I and my family love in these particular ones.And regardless of anything else on my order list BBQ buns are always there
2
Perhaps our taste buds are different, but it was a terribly disappointing trip to Tim Ho Wan. The place is very cramped, very noisy and you are seated very close together to other guests - but all that can be explained away by the possibility that the restaurant wanted it to have an authentic feel of busy Hong Kong.But the food - I am sorry but this is not what Dim Sum is. Yes, dim sum in Hong Kong has a different slant to what we get in Singapore, but this was neither good Hong Kong dim sum nor was it good Singapore dim sum. When the menu is so limited, you would expect that every item on the menu is of top standard. The only thing that came up tops is the Baked Bun with BBQ Pork, which was undoubtedly the best we have ever tasted. Everything else was bland, poorly done, and even dry. Regardless of how dim sum should taste, it should never be dry and that was how our pork dumplings came out
3
Had lunch with a friend at the Bedok Mall branch. The food was okay, though it was definitely not as good as the original stall in HKG.We had the glutinous rice, carrot cake, Pork buns, harkow, beef balls, siew mai and charsiu cheong fun. Nothing exceptional about most of the dishes, though I did like the glutinous rice and the siew mail.Service was very good and the staff came round often to pour our tea and to check if we needed the plates changed.When it opened last year, there were long queues sitting on the stools outside - I remember having to wait for over 45 minutes (we also had to wait for three hours in HKG). Though it is not as crowded now and we managed to snag a table on walking in withiut waiting, it can still get rather packed at lunchtime
4
One of two Tim Ho Wan eateries in SIngapore and both serve excellent dim sum. It is not cheap but does boast a Michelin star and probably deserves it. Not possible to book and the waiting time can sometimes be a bit long (it is very popular) but do not let that put you off. It has a good atmosphere for what it is, basically very good fast food
3
I'm surprised that this place is so popular. The dim sum is ok, but really it's not worth waiting in a queue. Service is efficient and the outlet in the City Link mall is quite convenient. There are better choices for dim sum in the vicinity
5
For an authentic Hong Kong dim sum lunch nothing beats this place. Fast, furious, always packed with customers. Short menu with only a dozen options.Really good food at reasonable prices -in fact, it is widely known this is the cheapest eatery in the world with a Michelin star. But service is average at best and the place is not good for large groups (waiting times can be frustrating) or for business lunches.If you are looking for your dim sum fix this is the place to go. The rice with beef and egg is delicious and not to be missed
4
This restaurant offers decent dim sum at reasonable prices. They don't offer the biggest variety, but focus on limited lumber of items....
Personally recommend the
- prawn with spinach
- fried with egg white (be careful as the inside is hot)
5
I am a fan of Din Tai Fung whereas my wife's favorite is Tin Ho Wan. The only thing I can say is that every time I go there, I am never disappointed. Great food.
4
I am a big fan of these restaurants in Hong Kong and was happy to find them in Singapore. Not as good as Hong Kong but still great quality at a great price
5
admittedly, i think this might have been the first time i've had dim sum outside of the US; but it was the best dim sum i've ever had. there wasn't a line when we arrived just before noon on a weekday. my favorite was the dim sum that has a bit of soup broth in it.
4
It's all about pork buns. I'm not sure what else people come for although my other half said that she visited the other evening and the radish cake was a revelation.The buns are different from standard char siew pau and variations. The shell is sweet and slightly crispy but very light - almost somewhere between cake and macaroon. The filling is also sweet - they have piled on the salt and sugar here. It's sort of like pork bun crack.To be honest while I'd happily eat then again I find them just a little cloying and too sweet. But hey, try for yourself. They make countless thousands of Singaporeans very happy
4
The bbq pork buns were outstanding, best I ever had with its buttery crust and sweet bbq pork meat. However the rest of the items were pretty mediocre, the siew mai in particular were quite disappointing and cannot compare to any of the dim sum in Hong Kong. I enjoyed the chicken and mushroom with steamed rice too. Would visit again for the pork buns if there isn't a crazy queue
5
I visited with my wife and 3 kids as I had read that they were the only Michellin star winning dumpling house in the world. The food is wonderful. The fried pork buns that a number of others have mentioned was brilliant. The dumplings are tender and the rolls delicate. It is quite cramped and you will need to leave strollers at the door. however service is quick and friendl
3
The pork bun was delicious, I always ordered it during visit. I have tried the rest of the dim sum, not bad but not really like very outstanding either. I would say the rest are average, personally not willing to take time for the long queue. Will still visit for the pork bun, crispy outside and delicious inside
4
Try the baked bun with BBQ pork (first dish on the menu). We avoided the pick hour queue, and found a table easily. We tried several dishes. We heard it was a one star michelin restaurant and a great place to try dim sums. Not bad but very noisy place
4
Went the one in the City Hall underground around 8pm. Order a lot of things: fried buns, siomay, hakau, fish maw + shrimps, chicken feet, congee, and rice bowl. All goods except the chicken feet, the style a little bit different compare to the one that i sed to eat. I have to choose: fried buns and fish maw are the best
5
I visited this restaurant during my holiday in Singapore with my wife, 3 year old daughter and my friend. We ordered:Rice with beef --> it is rice with egg and beef, taste so yummyBbq bun --> skin of the bun is so crispyHa kau, siew may --> taste OKChicken feet --> my daughter very like this, make all the server amaze because 3 year kid like this menu and can eat by herselfThe restaurant is not very big, interior is good, service is nice, and clean
4
in the centre of Singapore near Orchard road, is in a shopping mall at the ground floor the Singapore version of the original michelin star awarded Hong kong dim sum restaurant located. It is a very simple decorated small and very busy place. Except to queu up for 15 min before getting seats at one of the large tables. The Dim Sums are worth the wait, worth the noise and worth the "non romantic" setting; there quality is very, very tasteful. We have tried a selection of 8 and each was different, surprising and delicious
5
Saw a program on TV about the bbq pork buns where everyone in the place was raving about them.Having now tried the buns I can understand why. They are crispy but not greasy sweet and savoury at the same time.This truly is a must try dish
5
Went with family. Line looked long line but was much faster than other dim sum places in Singapore.Family of four, we had about 8 dishes (each one is about 4 bite size servings).Make sure you get the char su bao...bite into the sweet, warm and toasted bread into the pork stuffed bun.
3
Had brunch at this outlet at plaza singapura to try out the char Siew bun and the other signature dim sums of Tim Ho Wan. But the best is not the char Siew bun but the beancurd roll with pork. And the next nice item to try is the osmanthus cake which is very light and not too sweet dessert to end the meal with. Definitely this is not the best din sum as the price is not cheap as compare to dim sum places like yum cha
5
Had been wanting to try the famous Michelin-Star restaurant but not prepared to wait in line too long. My wife and I went on a weekday at 11:15am and there were less than 10 people in line. We got our table within 10 minutes. The dishes did not disappoint. Best dimsum I have ever tasted, especially the famous pork buns. Not cheap, as can be expected, but definitely can't wait to go back to try other dishes I missed
3
Heard many people say it was very delicious, so i decided to come to try out with my friends. i think most of the food are quite normal, the only special one is the BBQ pork bun. It really yummy. MUST try the BBQ pork bun
4
Just went to the Aperia/Kallang branch for brunch. Ordered a few dishes, all very nice and certainly not a notch better than many other Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Perhaps my expectation was set much higher with the Michelin rating. Still a very good choice for Yam Cha
4
Pork buns worthy of praise indeed. Cheong fun rice rolls smooth and soft too. Overall dim sum quality good for the price, just selection is limited. 3 Fried dishes (incl spring roll), congee (porridge) limited to one type of century egg.For casual fast lunch it be good. So come early to get in and out quick. I wouldn't que for it.
4
Pick your time or be prepared to queue. A very busy establishment but service was very quick once seated. We tried the Big 4 - the Baked Bun with BBQ pork being the winner here, a little bit salty a little bit sweet. Unusual. We also enjoyed the Steamed Egg Cake. Not a cheap meal but worth locating
5
i think pork bun here is different taste if compare at hongkong. i love all the dim sum and beef rice here.
3
The baked bbq pork bun is delicious. So are the siew mai n har kao. However the choice are limited and they hv only 1 congee in the menu
4
Best baked bun with BBQ Pork. The bun is so fresh and tasty. Very fast service at reasonable price. Good place for having quick and light lunch. Space is a bit small like Hongkong style
4
Good dim sum. Good menu selection, tasty food. The ambiance is like a fast food restaurant with close seating and there can be a wait to be seated. Worth a short wait but I'd never want to wait more than 20 minutes.
3
Perhaps, standard has dropped. The famous tim sum offer is not as wonderful as claimed. Seating is tight and you better eat fast and leave. It's not cheap for the quality. The queues happened to common when the outlets were opened are just no longer there
4
Ever since Tim Ho Wan opened at the Plaza Singapura, I have always seen long lines outside during lunch and in the evenings. Not one for waiting in long queues, I gave up on trying this famous restaurant chain from Taiwan.By chance I realized that they opened for breakfast and that there was no queue to get in! So finally I got to try their food.We ordered the baked bun with BBQ pork which was delicious, the spinach and shrimp dumplings, which were good, vermicelli roll with shrimp which was very good, the chicken, sausage and mushroom rice which was average - too much rice, too little meat. And the fresh seasonal vegetables. Overall everything was quite good, but I've had equally good food at other places in Singapore. The prices are reasonable and the service prompt
2
We were a family of 3 people which is just nice as most strays come in threes. The menu is very small but covers most of the typical Hong Kong dim sum items. We tried quite a number of items including the highly publicized baked bbq pork bun. Nothing was outstanding, more like run-of-the-mill type. Prices are high, comparable to restaurants in hotel. This restaurant is more like McDonald's 24hrs outlet. It is a place to go if you need a supper in some odd hours. If you are thinking of some fine dim sum dishes it is nowhere near there. There are some better restaurants elsewhere. It is incredible how such restaurant can be Michelin rated!
5
I had a reunion with friends at Tim Ho Wan. The food was delicisious! We met mid-morning and were able to catch up with each other while enjoying the fresh and tasty dim sum. I can't tell you which dishes we had because some one else ordered and I am not familiar with the names, but I can tell you that there were no bad plates. Yum
5
Plaza Singapura is one of those ubiquitous suburban Singapore shopping malls. It's actually on Orchard Road, but not in the most fashionable part. Take the MRT two stops further and get out at Dhobi Ghaut, from where you can reach it without going outside with luck! This branch of Tim Ho Wan is on the ground floor and is hard to miss. There's a long row of chairs outside for the queues, but we arrived around 10 minutes before the lunchtime rush and only waited 10 minutes. The menu and the system is essentially 'yum cha' except that you choose from about 15-20 dishes on a menu with pictures and then await events. They are not long before arrival and the dishes are simply excellent. We feasted on prawn dumplings, shrimp vermicelli rolls, glutinous rice dumplings (never mind the name, just eat!) and more - and the dessert we chose (mango pomelo sago), a smooth, pale yellow creamy mango with small pieces of peeled pomelo, all set in a sago base, was so utterly delicious that we had a second one. And all this was as "cheap as chips" - $S40
3
Queuing up for a spot in the restaurant may take up to an hour especially during dining hours of a weekend. Tim Ho Wan does help alleviate any impatience by having stools readily available and having its staff manage the queue by taking orders right before your turn is up. On this they really do a good job compared to most other restaurants with a similarly length of waiting diners.The main reason we came was because we expected a good dim sum spot but we were sad to say Tim Ho Wan fell short of our expectations. That is not to say they are bad. They offer a decent enough fare but nothing to scream about, and I had tasted dim sum that is done better. To their defense however, I did not try their Big 4, so I may missed some plus points for the restaurant.Despite all that negative opinions, the casual diner in us still enjoy the basic dim sum dishes meeting the minimum standards of our finicky taste buds. In my opinion, Tim Ho Wan's fare is decent enough but not so much to get me into the queue for a second round. Trying their dishes only earned me the claim of ever dining in a Michelin star restaurant but not enough to satisfy my taste buds
4
Prepare to queue especially during weekend lunch hour. Conveniently located at the Plaza Singapura. Quick service and good food.
5
This is definitely one of the best bun I've ever had in my life. Crispy but soft outside but so tender and juicy inside. Not to mention how delicious the pork inside.
1
First time eat here, receive horrible service! Keep chasing people for eating.
Keep interrupting people during communication by taking empty plate.
4
I had lunch with my Sister and Niece at Tim Ho Wan, Plaza Singapura today, table 10. We had to queu up and there were about 15 people ahead of us. However, the queu moved very fast and soon we had seats. While queuing, we can actually ticked the food we wanted to order. We had bbq pork buns which is crispy on the outside and moist bbq pork on the inside when you bit it. Next we had rice steamed with chicken and mushroom. We also ordered pork vermicelli, congee cooked with pork and century egg. For dessert, we had mango pomelo sago. For beverage, you can have a choice of home cooked barley or Chinese tea. The best part is when I went to the cashier to pay the bill, the cashier gave my Niece a welly egg. It is a pleasant surprise for her cause she is always curious what toy she will get when she opens the egg
3
Ambiance is food court like though the dim sum is pretty good considering the price. Pork buns and glutinous rice dishes are very good. Prawn and pork dumplings were disappointing though, you can get better at paradise or even peach garden. I would say this is the Cantonese Dim Sum equivalent of KFC or McDonald

Excellent pork buns- they definitely meet their award winning reputation.Food is reasonably priced you can order a lot of different plates to share and try.Staff are friendly and efficient. There is usually a line outside to wait for a table but it moves very quickly, they are also child and family friendly.Best place for this food in Singapore hands down

Was there for a late lunch. Was expecting a long queue, but there was none.After experiencing Tim Ho Wan dim sum in HK, it was important to see the difference. Order a number of the same items as what we had in HK, and overall, there is a little difference, notably in the BBQ pork buns, felt that the HK ones where slightly much nicer with more charred meat in them.But overall, was happy with the experince

Don't expect too much from words like "Michelin winning"... If you regard this dim sum restaurant as one of those Hawker or food court, it surely is a great place. Quick serving, Good taste (I especially like the bun with sweet pork inside), fair service and price
3
I came here in the morning, about 9am with my 4 others including my wife. Queue is quiet fast, they serve their food really fast and if you order Chinese tea, they will quickly fill up your glass when it's empty.I ordered baked bun bbq pork, vermicelli with shrimp, congee with pork, century egg and salted egg, glutinous rice with lotus leaf, spinach dumpling with shrimp. The best taste is baked bun bbq pork, the others is have a normal taste because the taste is same with others restaurant who serve dim sum

I visited the Plaza Singapura branch with my dad back in August 2015 for lunch on a weekday and we were surprised at how quickly we were seated, despite the queue. We ordered the following dishes: baked char siew pau, har gau, spinach dumpling with shrimp, pan fried carrot cake, vermicelli roll with shrimp, and congee with lean pork, century egg & salted egg. The star of our lunch was definitely the baked char siew pau though! It's no wonder it's one of their top 4 signature dishes, as stated on the menu. One serving comes with 3 of the paus, which is great for sharing (or having two for yourself, which is what I did!). Other great dishes to order were the har gau and spinach dumpling with shrimp. The skin of the dumplings were nice and thin, allowing better taste for the filling, which was delicious! The pan fried carrot cake was quite average, nothing exceptional about it but still yummy. However, we were quite disappointed with the congee. Perhaps it's because we aren't used to having a quite watery and runny consistency but it didn't suit our tastes. We quite liked the fact that they did take-away too though, which we noticed many customers were doing. They ordered additional servings to take away at the end of their meals. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant for brunch/lunch/dinner and an order (or two!) of the baked char siew pau is a must! Sticking to the top 4 signature dishes is a good idea, as they are probably signature for a reason
3
They serve delicious dimsum, but for what i heard i believe they are a bit overrated i personally think that crystal jade is better, but overall their dimsum still worth a try
3
All I can say is I Love the Baked Bbq Bun.. it was warm..crispy outside..moist and tender.. Amazing!!!wanting more.. üòäüòä
4
Good service, a variety of dish and delicious food. Different branches around Singapore which can be found easily. Sometime have to wait for a long time if come at "rush-hour"
4
Quiet full, so please consider that you have to Q.
Order the Bun is a must ! Really nice !
The Rice with Chicken also quiet unique.
The other menu is consider ok / average.
2
The food is nice and we enjoy the dim sum at this restaurant. Always long queue in business hour. However, the staff was not nice and friendly at all.
4
This place usually has very long queue... and the long stretch of stools just outside the restaurant are just for that....We were early and there was no queue so decided to go in and try their Dim Sum... This is the 2nd time I am frequenting the place.Tried the usual dim sum such as cheong fun, ribs, bean curd skin, etc, etc all delicious...The last dish I tried was their baked BBQ bun.... The bun just melt in my mouth... its the first time I have tasted a bun so perfectly cooked and has all the right taste, texture, etc....Will definitely come here again if passing Singapore..
4
My second time to taste Tim Ho Wan, but this time is located in Plaza Singapura. Inside the mall and quite a bit queueing. The services still fast though. My fave always been the pork dumplings. Range of the price are 4-6 SGD. I've tried their beef rice and it was delicious too (surprisingly) because I thought they only good for the dimsum?Overall, I recommend Tim Ho Wan if you go to Singapore, delish
5
We came to Tim Ho Wan upon recommendation by a friend, and are very glad we did!!! I recommend going a little early (perhaps 11:45/12) to beat the lunchtime rush as the queue gets very long! The atmosphere in there was great, the service quick and business-like, and the food was beyond incredible. The pork buns are out of this world, and the prawn wasabi dumplings were absolutely delicious. With a continual supply of tea to wash it all down with, we left feeling extremely full and extremely happy. You have to go here
3
The food is good, but really nothing special. If this gets a Michelin star, then the dim sum at say, Imperial Treasure Shanghai or Royal China should get three! The signature bun is good (if you like it sweet), but not nearly as good as the charcoal bun at London Fat Duck at Scotts Square. What they get a star for is in restaurant management; that part is certainly not dim! Even with long queues, the wait is 15-20 minutes max, and you could be out in 15 minutes. And they are capitalising on the Michelin star to open eateries everywhere in the Asia-Pacific region
5
First time tried Tim Ho Wan wondering why the people would wait. And after i tasted the food... the wait is worthwhile. The baked bun with char siew... v roll... and porridge and rice with beef and egg.. The taste was amazing.. just love it so much
5
Their signature dish the bun so delicious .. really want to came back for more. Im ate at plaza singapore the environtment was nice and service fast too
4
Went back and did not disappoint.
It is a factory of Dim Sum but by a 2 Michelin Star chef and the food always delivers.
5
Fantastic dim sum that melts in your mouth and at a good price. Smallish place so choose your time to get there as it is popular. The more dim sum you eat the cheaper the branded umbrellas are ( a necessity for Singapore)
3
love their bbq buns and siew mai. but everything else were ordinary,the chicken feet are good but a bit tasteless. the place is overcrowded and noisy that we have to talk pretty loudly.price were quite expensive, but overall i'm pretty satisfied with this place.
2
Fast service and so on do not redeem the fact that the dim sum was pretty poor. All felt premade and lacked in both taste and texture. The bbq pork, as an example, was overly sweet and too dry. The bun tasted like premade sponge cake. We chose to leave even though we were still hungry. Many hawkers and caf√É¬©s beat this easily
2
This is our fourth visit - we were so excited to be going again that we went straight from the airport (dropping the bags at the hotel on the way but not even checking in). The food was just as good as previously ... until about 30 minutes later when we were gasping for water with a headache starting - the usual signs of an overdose of MSG. A real shame they've resorted to MSG rather than real flavours
4
I've been to Tim Ho Wan a couple of times already. To be honest, the dim sum is just average and there's nothing spectacular about it. HOWEVER, it still has one of the best BBQ Pork Buns around in Singapore. So if there was only ONE thing you'd order, I would highly recommend that!Service is prompt and efficient
4
Queue was there with patrons waiting patiently. A pool of spilled water was at the entrance and the industrious usher quickly wiped it with some tissues after it was highlighted.We waited about 20 mins for a table which was good. Our order was processed quickly despite the chattering crowd. However the noise is still manageable as compared to the authentic dim sum noise in HK ... We will learn as they read their newspaper besides meeting with friends and family.The stewed chic feet are softer here and not deep fried. The bean curd with prawns and meat are stewed with chilli and is good. Carrot cake is fried with a fried base but maintaining its softness. The rice dumpling in lotus leaf was very flavorful you need not eat it with chilli paste. Siew mai is moist. The steamed beef balls and fried bean curb rolls with prawns need improvement. The egg century congee was too thick ... reminds me of baby congee ... Disappointment as it is my favourite.The star of the dim sum here is their roasted crispy pork bun ... Wow! Crispy thin skin with moist char siew oozing into your mouth with every bite ... Yummy!To my surprise the Toa Payoh branch was good and was better than the original one I visited in HK .... Thank you chefs and also to the smiling, composed and passionate server, Alice whom I thanked for her gd service before I left with a very heartening meal
2
If you nothing to do and not very hungry, go wait for a seat. You may have a chair to sit while queuing if you are very lucky.Best point was food was delivered less than 5 minutes after placing order. Need to check what brand and model of microwave they're using. Luckily there was only another short queue at the payment time.happy that all cc was accepted
5
We like Dim Sum having been brought up on it in London's Chinatown and then Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.Our curiosity was aroused by Tim Ho Wan's Michelin star and we ate a couple of times in the Kowloon branch. Most recently we were in Singapore. First of all there is consistency between countries. This bodes well for what seems to be an expanding chain.Personal favourites were Baked Bun with BBQ Pork, Vermicelli Roll stuffed with Pig's Liver and Pan Fried Turnip Cake. By the way it is common, but pointless, to mis-translate cheung fun as vermicelli. Lasagne is the nearest European equivalent but surely by now the Chinese names are familiar and attempting Italian adds nothing.Every choice on the menu seems to lift Dim Sum from the reliable and the classic (nothing wrong with this) to new heights. Still Dim Sum, selected little dishes touched by a chef's genius but firmly rooted in realit
4
A little bit cramped but service was quick. We had the bbq buns which was fantastic. Ordered the steamed rice, glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf, siew mai, har kaw. Doesn't offer a lot of choices but everything we ordered tasted ok.
5
I love Tim Ho Wan and make sure I eat there every time I go to SIngapore. If you like dim sum that is reasonabe priced, fresh and delicious it is worth the wait for a seat.
4
The food was great. The dim sum was awesome. Order the siomay and the vermicili. It will blow your mind. Have a great lunch here. Just come early, cause the place is super crowded.
5
Their dim sum is really good but we really went there for the pork buns. They were very crumbly and good while hot. Each order contains 3 buns. We enjoyed it so much we ordered 3 sets!
4
I ate at the original outlet in Hong kong, and the standard is much higher. I feel the food here is manufactured somewhere and brought to the restaurant outlet to be cooked. So that to me is wasted.
4
Really excellent food. Many of the individual dishes were the best of their type I have had in Singapore. The choice is relatively small. Staff were pleasant and efficient. We walked in. I would not recommend waiting in a long line. It will take away your enjoyment of the meal

** This review is for Tim Ho Wan in Aperia **W went for an early lunch on a Saturday and the queue was not horrendously long - about 15 minutes to get a table. It was fairly crowded and we were given a small table by the what-seemed-to-be-the-entrance-by-the-main-road-but-the-management-probably-decided-last-minute-to-close-it floor-to-ceiling window. We ordered a few of the signature dim sum, e.g. the baked char siew bun, turnip cake and steamed egg cake, and our usual dim sum like siew mai, har gou, steamed rice rolls etc. Service was really quick, which was great since we were hungry. I was keen to try the baked char siew bun since it's their signature and heard so much about it. I took a bite, and ... It's sweet!!! That kind of puts me off... I know char siew is sweet but I know it as sweet-savory, not sweet-sweet like a dessert. I tried the rest of the dim sum, hoping to like them but felt that it was just ok, nothing spectacular. There are many better dim sum places in Singapore.The prices are not exactly cheap, and with the quality, I'm really not impressed. Would I go again? Probably not, unless someone really wants to go. Would I queue to eat? Definitely no way

This was my first ever experience of the famed Tim Ho Wan dumpling house and I was so impressed that we visited twice. We dined at the Plaza Singapura restaurant and it was amazing both times. The wait times to get a table weren't as steep as I thought they would be, and the quality of food along with the price was exceptional. This place gave me the appreciation for pork buns, as previously I was yet to try one that I enjoyed... until now. If it's busy, be patient as it's worth the wait. The pork buns were amazing. You are in for a treat. I cant wait to try the original in HK
3
Heard so much about this joint (miss the outlet in HKG due to long queue) and managed to sample it in Spore. Went there about 5.30pm, and there is already some minor queue. Even though our table (for 4 persons) is ready, we were made to wait outside as one of us haven't arrive yet. Later was ushered to our table. Ordered and dishes came out quite fast. The shanghai BBQ bun is the favorite, lotus leave glutenous rice is tasty as well. the cheong fun is good and the rest of the dishes, are forgettable to me. Total cost for 4 persons about SGP 99
4
Went to the branch at Plaza SG twice during my visit. Both times, no queue (must be the timing ‚Äì mid-week, early dinner, late lunch). There‚Äôs not a wide menu but what they have is very tasty and good quality. They seem to have a good system of ordering and keeping track of what‚Äôs been served. Will go back next time I‚Äôm in Singapore
3
Tim Ho Wan always had a long queue, so if you really want fast, do not go in large group, preferably 2 person is the best as you will be able to jump queue faster. Tim Ho Wan is very famous in Hong Kong, thus create the frenzy among the people. Not every dim sum is great though, so far I only found the cha siew bao and the chee chong fun nice, other was just very average. The price is a bit on the higher end also, recommended to try at least once
4
Went to the Aperia Mall outlet, which is new and has shorter waiting times. Awesome dim sums, particularly the spinach and prawns. The spring rolls were very good too. Clearly the stool seating suggests that they do not want you to hang around for too long
1
RegularIy visit Tim Ho Wan at Plaza SG, and although the dining experience is generally chaotic and basic, the food is mostly quite tasty. The service is never good, but I guess that's the HK Dimsum way. However today my GF twice had what looked like pubic hair in her Dimsum, which is disgusting. After the 1st find, they replaced, only for the next to also have more thick black hair - unbelievable! As usual a sorry do you want another was the response - no offer to cancel the bill or provide any real compensation for a ruined lunch - so instead had to refuse to pay. One day Singapore restaurants will learn to be proactive and think about how to get returning trade. Not a good advertisement for Tim Ho Wan and how they clean their kitchen or treat their customers
4
Service was alright and the serving of food is pretty fast! I won't consider ALL of the food as fantastic, but some of them are REALLY GOOD! Theres always a queue before we were seated, so be sure to go early :) Definitely worth going another time
4
If you're going to spend time waiting in the queue to be seated, do visit this restaurant for their delicious and beyond Pork buns, Egg tarts (not always available) and pork vermicelli rolls. These 3 dishes was what make me stand in the queue worthwhile. The pork buns are not your average steamed buns with glutenous dough, rather they were coated with something sweet and they just melted in your mouth. The egg tarts were great too, the pastry was like a very loaded shortbread cookie (P.S - ONE PORTION HAS 3 TARTS SO DO NOT OVER ORDER LIKE I DID). The pork and vermicelli rolls were also beautifully flavoured, although these have only 3 rolls a portion so order accordingly as they're very light. Decently priced dishes. Carrot cake a bit of a disappointment
2
Hmm, I absolutely love dim sum and regularly seek it out all over the world. Encouraged by the chairs arranged outside this restaurant purely to accommodate the peak time queues, we dived in and basically ordered half the menu. From the BBQ pork buns to the Spinach and Shrimp dumplings each dish was bland and uninspired
5
Having visited a large number of places serving Dim Sum, this is my all time favourite. If I could go right now then I would as I think I have an addiction to the BBQ buns, Wasabi crispy prawn Dim Sum, Har Gau served at Tim Ho Wan. Yes, if you arrive peak time expect to queue, arrive a little earlier or later and you'll have a 10 minute wait, but, it is really worth it for the flavour and the quality of Dim Sum (or Yum Cha) served. I can't wait to go back and hope one opens in the UK soon
4
I went to the branch in Plaza Singapura at Douby Ghaut on a couple of occasions. They offer a limited menu but don't let that put you off. This dim sum restaurant has a Michelin Star and they deserve it. The food is some of the best dim sum I have tried especially their roast BBQ pork buns. The usual favourites of steamed prawn and pork dumplings and prawn hau gau are on the menu as well as some dishes that I would describe as traditional Chinese such as chicken feet which seemed very popular with the locals!And don't forget to try their chunky chilli dip with the dim sum.
5
Excellent. Simply outstanding food, service and value. This HK icon is spreading throughout Asua. The menu is simple though all items are of incredibly high quality. Be prepared to queue at peak times though mid week at 2pm was fine. Went with a party of 7. Note, no alcohol on the menu and limited options for Vegetarians
5
i must say, it worths to wait, the queue is quite long, but it worth, it is one of the branches from hongkong, and the restaurant certified with michelin star, really recomended to try
4
Seriously the best baked pork buns ever! For the others, taste like any other dim sum. Make sure you come to this place either early (brunch) or late lunch. Place is super packed!
5
We went to the one out in Jurong (Westgate) in Singapore. We arrived around 11am....it was packed!. That popular! We ordered his top 3 speciality dishes - Baked BBQ Pork Buns, Pan Fried Rice Cake and Egg Cake. We also got other dishes, Glut Rice, Sui Mai, BBQ Pork Roll, Congee and another dumpling. I have tasted a few pork buns in my time and these Baked Pork Buns were AMAZING.Carrot Cake and Sui Mai is also my favs and they tasted amazing. They had alot of flavour.The dishes are slightly more expensive but worht every penny if you are a Dim Sum fan!The service was excellent and didn't wait long at all.Highly recommend this Restaurant - but make sure you get in early so you don't have to wait
3
The BBQ pork bun was the only item we ordered from their "Big 4 Heavenly King Dim Sum", and it really was the best we'd ever had. Everything else we ordered, however, was a bit of a let down. we had the siu mai, BBQ pork cheong fun, beancurd skin rolls and one other item that I can't remember, all of which was nice enough, just nowhere near what I had expected from all the hype the restaurant has. Queuing for a table wasn't too bad (3pm on a Sunday) and the service was prompt and efficient, as expected at a busy dim sum restaurant. Having eaten dim sum all over the world (seriously, I LOVE dim sum) I have had my fair share of both good and bad, but unfortunately I won't be dreaming of going back to Tim Ho Wan's anytime soon
5
Amazing food with quick service and delicious local flare. This was recommended by a local taxi driver and it was well worth the wait. The dim sum was delicious and frankly I would've stayed and eaten longer if I had any room left to consume more of that delicious food
5
The original TimHoWan Dim Sum restaurant is situated in Hong Kong. A businessman from Singapore acquired the rights to this brand and opened the first TimHoWan Dim Sum restaurant outside of Hong Kong. It is the most successful restaurant story that I know of. The queues where three hours long! Then he had T-Shirts printed stating: ‚ÄúI stood in the queue for three hours at TimHoWan Dim Sum‚Äù and dished it out to everybody standing in the queue. Then the queue became five hours long! That is in any case the story that the laminated newspaper articles tells you that you can read while standing in the queue at TimHoWan Dim Sum restaurant in Singapore. I am a Westerner and does not have the love for Dim Sum as the Chinese. After the TimHoWan experience I like Dim Sum much more than before. The queue at TimHoWan Dim Sum is worth the wait and thousands of Singaporeans agree
4
Celebrated my birthday with my sister at this restaurant. There was a queue but it moves very fast cause we only need two seats. Love o at the mango sago pomelo, century egg and salted egg congee, the baked bun with bbq pork, carrot cake, braised chicken feet with abalone and prawn dumpling. Will definitely come again. Heard from my sister, my niece love to eat here with her university friends too
4
I went for dinner with friends and had to queue up for about 20 min but it'd be better if you go as a couple because it's easier to find seats for you. We ordered almost everything on the menu from the famous BBQ pork bun, harkao, shrimp rice roll, carrot cake, mixed vegetable etc. the taste was okay but not exceptionally different from other good dim sum place
5
I had the opportunity to eat here at boy was i blown away by the quality of their dimsum. This was my first time to eat at a dimsum place that has a michelin star to its name and it truly was gastronomic heaven for me especially those buns that they are famous for and that mango-pomelo dessert was to die for. I can't wait to go back. The staff members were friendly and very efficient
3
Went to this yum cha restaurant which is from Hong Kong. Their speciality is the baked pork bun. Although the bun looks special (baked) but think the pork char siew is just above average. Another nice dish to try is the chicken wrapped with lotus leaf. Seats are a bit cramped though. Also be prepared to wait as there is always long queue
5
The bbq pork buns are divine and well worth the wait. Cannot wait till they open a restaurant here in Sydney.
4
Just came for the pork bun and it didn't disappoint. Very nice, crunchy on the outside, hot and goodness on the inside.
5
Baked pork buns - delicious!
Worth the wait when you're served by lovely helpful staff and delivered tasty tasty dim sum!
4
Long queue but really worth it. Pork Bun is a must. Good place with great taste for dim sum. Will be back again when visit SG.
3
Our friends took us here knowing that I love Char Sui Bao (a fluffy light steamed bread bun stuffed with BBQ pork)The Char Sui Bao here is not like any I have had before, the filling is tasty but rather rich and the outside is more like a oven baked pastry than steamed bread. They were very nice but not what I was hoping for. I think I would have liked them more if they were named something different, It is like saying you are going to make an omelette but without any eggs. The rest of the dishes we had were also very nice but other than the "carrot cake" I am struggling to remember what else we ate which can only mean I wasn't blown away.Even though the prices aren't massive I have had better for cheaper
5
Finally a reasonably priced high quality dim sum place in singapore. Very authentic Cantonese. Prices more expensive than Hong Kong but that is singapore. Lives up to acclaim of cheapest michellin starred restaurant. Nothing fancy but charziupao and harkao shumai are excellent. Don't expect white table cloth but rather just really good dimsum
4
Tonight, The Beau and I decided to have a light dinner, and since we were in the vicinity - decided to pop by Tim Ho Wan @ Aperia for a try. This outlet is new, and opens 24 hours a day; closed on Mondays for maintenance. Other than that, same procedure of short queue followed by menu checklist in which you tick the items you would like to order.After the BBQ Pork Buns, we had the Yam Dumpling with Chilli Crab Meat (SGD$5.50) - crispy and flakey yam dumpling fried to a pale golden hue, filled with Singapore's favorite chilli crab in its wombs. The combined flavors and textures of the yam - crispy on the outside, but sweet with hints of stickiness on the inside, made for a good contrast with the chilli crab. The only complaint was that the "chilli crab" fillings was too sweet and not spicy enough.Then the Jade Wanton in Laksa Soup (SGD$5.00) was served. Now, this was more like it - I enjoyed this very much, with the thick laksa gravy, resplendent with traditional laksa taste. The soup was filled with succulent dumplings as well as dried beancurd (taupok) soaked deliciously in its gravy.Finally, we concluded the dimsum dinner with desserts - Tonic Medlar with Osmanthus Cake (SGD$3.50), a jelly textured delicacy filled with goji berries and has a very lovely osmanthus fragrance to it; it was like eating smooth, chilled cubes of flowers.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/dinner-at-tim-ho-wan-aperia.htm

I visited the branch at Aperia (the recently opened branch near Lavender MRT). Despite all the hype on this restaurant, I seriously think it is being over-rated. There was totally no queue when we went on a Thursday evening. The place was pretty cramp and the menu was quite limited. The dim sum that we ordered was considered so-so, just normal where we could get anywhere. Really nothing fantastic. But it was expensive. 2 of us which we only ordered about 6 dishes with no mains cost us $40. The only good thing was their service. They were quick in clearing the empty plates after we finished. When the lady at the door saw that we had a baby with us, she was attentive enough to give me a sofa seat at the corner. Tried once, enough. Won't be back
1
The food is, contrary to their claim to a michelin star in Hong Kong, disastrous! I strongly suspect that food here is not freshly made. Instead, they were frozen from HK and shipped to Singapore for re heating at the kitchen. Hence I feel that we are paying a lot for frozen food. The place is very small and seating is tight. There is a great sense of rush at the restaurant.Even before I finished all my food on the table, the waitress asked if she could remove some empty dishes from my table, which I agreed as the small table was a bit crowded for the amount of food I ordered. While I was fiddling with my phone, I realized suddenly that she had totally cleared my table and advised me to make payment at the counter, and they have meanwhile put another customer right in front of me waiting for me to leave the restaurant. I made some noise and said I haven't finished my food. The waitress said I agreed for her to clear my table, which meant, to her, I wasn't eating any more. She was totally unapologetic and put the blame on me!For the price of the food, seriously, with such nasty service, I strongly recommend any one with the right mind to NOT even consider approaching this place with a ten-foot pole
4
Q-ing during peak hours is mandatory as this place is always crowded. But We've been there on non-peak and was immediately seated. Surprisingly, once seated you don't have to wait long for food. Some items are hit & miss. Our fave are classics like century egg congee, prawn dumplings, crispy bun with pork filling, and chicken, mushroom & sausage rice. But we have to always ask for more sauce coz the server usually pour only a little and takes the sauce away. Duh!!! Mango dessert was nice and sweet. The steamed cake was also not bad
3
Limited items on the menu, but still go with couple of friends or the entire family and you can have the entire menu. Do try the pork buns
Cheers
4
Tim Ho Wan is my go-to restaurant for dim sum. Quality consistent and good. Selection limited but the menu is varied enough to have an interesting meal. Food delivered quickly, but in no particular order. I like that the dim sum is very fresh.
2
We went to the branch near Lavender station. A modern, clean environment and we were shown quickly to our table. The fried noodles & BBQ pork was very good, as were the dumplings and baked buns. Everything else was pretty average.The service started off well, but as we were about to eat, a waiter was distributing full bottles of soy sauce to the tables, and unfortunately distributed them over me instead. We didn't make a fuss, despite the fact that I was soaked in the stuff. When we came to pay the bill, I had to argue for a discount for the mess they had made, and was given a $3.39 refund. Not much towards a ruined shirt and trousers The stains remain to remind me not to return
4
I first tasted Tim Ho Wan when I was in Hong Kong last July.My friends took me to this newly opened branch in Singapore (@plaza singapura) when I visited there this December.And the taste is just the same as the one in Hongkong.I have the Must Have Dim Sum meals such as Bakpao, Leng Hong Kien, and siomay. But, what makes me come back are the signature dishes such as Steam Egg Cake (it's so fluffy like you are eating cotton) and BBQ Pork bakeBun (yumm, i like this better than the Crystal Jade). My friends order the Ciongfan with two different tastes (i kind of forgot what they are). The other one which I think is just OK is the steamed rice with beef and egg. Only the egg that caught my attention as it's fried with medium done. I always have a thing with medium done egg where i would enjoy the simmering of the yellow liquid comes out when we cut it out.About the price, well it's more expensive compare to Hong Kong. But it's worth in Singapore.
4
Visited tim ho wan in sg.Queue was quite long.Service was efficient just like in hk.However,I think its still not as good as the ones in HK.Char siew pau was kinda sweet,the carrot cake was also not thoroughly fried.And a cup of barley costed $2 and chinese tea for a shocking $1.30.Still one of the best dim sum shop in town though
3
I find the food here pretty normal. The gravy for the glutinous rice was too bland for my tastes(heard that it's because they don't use MSG). Service was prompt despite the crowds as our food arrived within 5 minutes after ordering. Be prepared to queue if you want dine here
4
I love small crowded places with a long line. The usually hold a promise.At first glance (and fairly long wait) I was feeling that I'm going to get disappointed. Service is NOT nice, very slow and impatient. Menu is small (but interesting and creative, I must say. They charge for water and charge service (not regular in Singapore). They were going to get 2 stars...But then the dumplings arrived.AMAZING. The best I had. They won 2 stars back, easily. Enjoy
4
I ate at this place with my wife and son. We are attracted mainly by its reputation and long lines. We were there at around 11:00am (before the lunch time crowd) on a weekend.The lines was not too long and it was quite easy for the staff to get us (small group) a table quickly. I think our total wait time is around 20 mins which is decent.When we are seated, we ordered almost immediately as we already know what we want. The menu is very simple and there are very few items to choose from. And while waiting for 20 mins, we already picked what we wanted.The food that we ordered came almost immediately. Even though there is a wait to be seated, the food came almost immediately and the overall 'waiting time' is relatively short. With a hungry 4 year old son, this is very good for me.The food is tasty but honestly it does not taste fantastic for me. It is a nice dim sum meal at a reasonable price but that is about it

The queues are shorter now so decided to give it a go. Ordered the char siu bun, glutenous rice, seasonal vegetables, century egg porridge, pork ribs and a mango sago pomelo dessert. The food was pretty average with the exception of the century egg porridge, which was well seasoned with a generous dose of century egg, and the vegetables, which were cooked beautifully and the sauce on it was tasty. The char siu buns were nowhere as nice as the ones in Hong Kong, the pastry was flat and the filling was lacking. Should not have ordered the dessert, the pomelo was almost non-existent, the mango sauce was this artificially bright yellow colour and tasted just like it came out of a bottle

At the time of holidays, often seen long queues. I was lucky to come on weekdays, not at mealtimes. No need to queue. Fast service (restaurant was not crowded). The menu is not much choice. Recommended Food: Baked Bun with BBQ Pork, Lo Ma Kai (glutinous lotus leaf wrap with pork), Beef Ball with Beancurd Skinl, Pork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce.Will definitely come back here

Yes you have to wait to get in. Seating is not that comfortable. But it is absolutely worth it. Loved the food. Love the cuisine
4
Standard maintain as per what I had in HK, in love with the special cha siew bao there.
But every outlet in Singapore seem like long queue...
4
The 4 signature dishes were AMAZING! A major gastronomical delight, especially since I've never tried anything of the sort before.
Only negative comment is the queue is quite long. Worth the wait though.
3
Was there at the Plaza Singapura Branch, food was average, only the Fried Char Siew Pao is really special, the rest of the dim sum are just average level.
Dont order the beef ball, soggy and doesnt even taste like beef. >.<

My family visited the outlet today at aperia,Singapore. It was not an experience I would ever want again.All the food we ordered came rainning down on us within seconds.We were a party of nine but with three small tables to sit around.We managed to add another one after some dinners left but was met with a very unhappy and rude restaurant manager who was against it.Towards the end of our very quick dinning experience, she came back and removed the table while I was still drinking my chinese tea. It seems that all she was interested were getting more customers in and chasing those ex customers out! What a let down!!

We visited the 24 hr Tim Ho Wan dim sum restaurant at Aperia in Kallang. While chewing my food i bit into something hard thinking it cld be bone pieces. To my horror i realised it was a rusty steel short and thin wire. We called for attention and the staff offered to replace the dim sum which we decided to cancel the order. The restaurant offered free dessert which we did not accept as the matter relates to food safety and it affected my confidence in the food content. Im not sure if the staff or the chef or cooks understd the seriousness of tge matter. I observed that tge patrons are mostly older folks and families. The restaurant seriously needs to review the safety and hygiene process in food preparation. this is not acceptable for a restaurant that claims to originate frm Hongkong and that its 1-Michellin. Thefood appears to be no better than dim sum in a gd chinese restaurant in Singapor
5
Sit on your plastic stool in the queue for an hour or so, shuffle along with the crowd and pour over your selection tick list whilst you wait. Its worth it......BAKED BBQ PORK BUNS, even if you just do that, your wait will have been worthwhile. Could easily have rejoined the queue and gone again hoping the hour long wait will have created some more room
5
Oh how I miss Hong Kong! But that is another review. Tim Ho Wan has come to Singapore in a big way and it is fabulous. Baked Bun with BBQ pork is why there is a Michelin star on the original restaurant. The cheapest Michelin starred restaurant in the world. I have some pictures but they just don't do it justice. Come hungry and be prepared for a line

Tim Ho Wan has been hailed as one the top restaurants for "dim sum". It makes this goal from its restaurant in HONG KONG and now have several branches in Hong Kong. Tim Ho Wan then set foot in SINGAPORE; with it's first outlet in PLAZA SINGAPURA. The media rave about it; and the queue snakes around the restaurant almost daily. There are now several branches in Singapore. TOA PAYOH outlet is one of them. Their house speciality are: 1) Char Siew Pao ( bun with roasted pork); 2) Ma Lai Goun (steamed plain rice cake with brown sugar).......However, the recent visit to above outlet finds the quality of both the items are well below par!!! The bun has more air than fillings; one literately tasting AIR then filling! The steamed cake is not as light as it was and should be; and no difference from many stalls selling the same thing and at much lower price and some give better quality!!! There is probably lack of good chef, due to extreme expansion by the outlet. This would likely be very costly for the GROUP, if not review quickly

This tim sum chain is opened by Michellin Star Chef. The outlet I visited is at Plaza Singapura, opposite Starbucks at ground floor. Queue is a must and they do not take reservation. They will only allow groups in when all patrons arrive at the queue. The crispy skin bun is a must try! Porridge is excellent and the prawn dumplings and siew mai are the best I've tried
4
singporean likes to queue and based on their long queue, it shows how great the foods are.. hehe, for this dim sum place, choose non lunch/dinner time.. and i recommend their casio bao, 3pcs/portion and it tastes awesome... dont think twice to order more :)
4
We came down early in the morning for breakfast and ordered about 5 selection for two of us. The food was tasty but the place noisy like a regular chinese dim sum place. We saw a line for large groups of people, I don't think it'll be the best choice to be left waiting for a long time to get a table. Two is a good number
5
We are rice, baked buns and egg cake at PLaza Singapura! All of them were really good, but the baked buns were outstanding. Best of all, the food wasn't terribly expensive -- food for 2 cost us as much as one 7/11 run did (around SG$30)
4
Okay, so maybe I was not completely bowled over in the I-must-have-it-everyday fashion but I thought my first-ever Tim Ho Wan experience was delicious. After months of nursing my curiosity for the much raved about dimsum and always feeling dejected each time we see the ridiculous queue outside the restaurant, I thought I was pretty lucky when one day I passed by the Plaza Singapura outlet and the queue was manageable. Even luckier when I was ushered to a seat in less than 3 minutes. Ah, the joys of dining solo sometimes.:)Since they don't really have a plethora of dishes on the menu, and anyway, I already know exactly what I've been dying to try, I wasted no time in ordering the famous pork buns and opted for prawn dumplings and the deep-fried tofu skin spring rolls to go with the buns. As though I had forgotten that I was dining alone that afternoon, the quantity of what I ordered and its impact on my easily-satisfied stomach hit me when I came face-to-face with my food. So what did I think of the pork buns? Oh they were sensational! The soft, warm, tasty bread that sort of comes apart gently in your mouth with each bite, to reveal a dollop of delicious pork at the center. Just beautiful. The prawn dumplings and tofu skin spring rolls were likewise tasteful but honestly, I can't really tell the difference from other good dumplings I've tried elsewhere. I was expecting the food to come with a ridiculous price tag, what with the hype and all, but it was surprisingly very affordable. So that's another plus point for Tim Ho Wan. In the end, I managed to eat everything I ordered and even made a mental note of other dishes I'm going to try next time with my husband. Hopefully, we will get just as lucky with the seats.:

Shortly speaking, the best dim sum I have ever had! Awesome ! Michelin star I can see why it earns Michelin one star! Moreover, it is not pricy, too. A valued place to dine! Highly recommend to people who love dim sum. However, the space between tables is just too narrow, we could not even pass between the tables we seated and next to us. Perhaps that's the reason why I considered it is a bit noisy. You have to speak aloud. So! Avoid this restaurant when you want to have a romantic date because you might have to shout to make yourself clear. Queue is long during lunch time. Tips for people who want to try decent dim sum but hate queuing : Arrive there before 11:00 am( they start at 10:30am), and have dim sum as brunch might be a good choice

I went to have an early dinner with my mom and daughter in the Plaza Singapura branch of this dim sum place. We had to queue for about 15mins to get a table for 3 in a packed place. i placed my order and gave it to one of the staff. The first batch of what i ordered came after about another 15mins. And everything followed after that. Service was fast because im sure the staff are looking at the long queue waiting outside for their table. If you are expecting that you can take your sweet time eating their nice food, then you are going to be disappointed. Staff will try to clear your table even if you still have some food to finish to sort of remind you that there are people waiting outside for their table. That's probably the reason why instead of giving my experience a high rating i only gave it a 3. The price is a little high for dim sum. The reason probably is the Singapore branch is riding on the Michelin star given to the Hong Kong branch. Food is ok...price is a little high for dim sum and the overall dijing experience not so good. I don't want to feel im being rushed to finish my mea

After hearing all sorts of reviews about TIm Ho Wan in Singapore, most of which stating that the dim sum is overrated, I decided to give this place a try. To my surprise, the dim sum was actually pretty good. The highlight of the meal is the baked char siew bao. It has a nice crisp texture and good crunch; the rich char siew juice oozes out after every bite. The other dim sum dumplings such as the Har gow and siew mai are also pretty good. Price performance-wise, I think the quality served and prices they charge are fairly reasonable. I am aware that locals like to have their dim sum meals at restaurants such as Swee Choon and 126 Eating house because the dim sum served is significantly cheaper and therefore seen as a much better deal. However, it is important to note the lower quality of the dim sum served at these restaurants. I don't think Tim Ho Wan is overrated at all, and in fact, is one of the better quality dim sum restaurants in Singapore

If I could end this review in one sentence, it'd be - Curiosity kills the cat.I told my partner, "I'm always curious about where the fuss over this and that restaurants at PS. Why the long queue?"And we peeked, asked, and got a table immediately past dinner time. We felt lucky.We were shoved to a corner, which we had expected some claustrophobic condition at any other dim sum place. But we were quite depressed when the wait staff just threw our order chit on our table after she had keyed in to the system.Not to mention they got one of our orders wrong and dished the correct one to another table. the wondrous thing is, the other bugger happily ate our food. (slap forehead)But we got ours replaced and apologised almost instantly, which was acceptable.We ordered adequate food amount for a dinner for 2. There were good and the bad.The Pork Vermicelli (Chu Chang Fen) was good, but the sauce is too bloody salty. It felt like they ran out of sauce and just replaced them with Soy Sauce. Maybe that's a strategy to encourage us to order more drinks.The Carrot Cake was bland. Absolutely tasteless. But luckily we had the sauce from the Vermicelli, and outrageously....they actually match perfectly!! You should try.The Rice Beef & Fried Egg - The Beef, simply awful. To me, it tasted like beef flavoured pudding.But not all was so mind boggling. We were both hooked on the Congee with Lean Pork and Century Egg. The portion of Century Eggs were just right. It does not overwhelm your palette with the "stench" (tho I love it). The texture of the congee was so moist and well cooked, we couldn't bear to swallow them.Prices were reasonable. Barley Water or Soft drinks are at $2 each, which is even cheaper than the fast food joint in the basement. Comparatively for an eating place in a mall at the heart of town, in Singapore, the pricing is reasonable. Which, that alone could explain the long queue. Sitting capacity is the other.Return to eat? No thanks...No photos this time. Couldn't be bothered. Sorry

Last night was the second time there with my family. Seeing that it was a Sunday evening, we were seated rather quickly. No complaints there.Food was also decent but do not see/taste what all the hype is about. The BBQ pork bun was delicious and the other item worth a shout is the Porridge with lean pork, century and salted duck egg. Have had century egg porridge many time abut last night was the first time I tried one with salted duck egg thrown in.I must admit that this was nice, very nice indeed. In, there was a man sitting next to us who had two orders of the porridge and after tasting it, I can understand why.Apart from the two items mentioned, all the rest were average or slightly above average.Total bill for 4 pax came up to S58.60. Not bad for value, considering we ordered 10 items in total.If not from the ambiance, I would have given Tim Ho Wan a higher rating. It was very noisy and we felt like they were rushing us thru our meal. Then again, with the line of dinners waiting to be seated, I cannot fault them.The noise level was something else. Cannot really hear what my daughters are saying, even when they were seated across a rather small table.Overall, decent food, quick service but Michelin Star....... I wonder......

This dim sum place is Amazing. I swear there's no dim sum place better than this.When going here, there are some tips, that I want to share : 1. Order the Bake Bun with Barbecue Pork ( if you eat pork )This is the best menu and one of their signature dish.2. To avoid long queue please limit the number of people you're going with ( max 3 ) the less the people the faster you'll get the table.3. When queuing don't go anywhere because when one of your friend or family member is not there with you, they'll need to re-queue again. 4. And the last one is, try to come early in the morning (9-10 AM preferably 
3
ate here two times already but the only dish i was excited to eat was their bbq pork bun,its sweet and toasted bun compliments well the bbq pork inside of it...their other food are slightly below in terms of taste compared to the other dimsums i have tasted in other restaurants,nonetheless anybody who haven't tried eating here who are willing to fall in line for 15-30 mins, can freely do so just to experience first hand why other people are crazy about it:
3
I hate queue-ing, and I've always stayed away from Tim Ho Wan because of the famous at least half an hour queue, seriously, they're just dim sum, half an hour is really too much.Anyway, there was a day we passed by Tim Ho Wan at the off peak hour and there was no queue so we decided to try.Yes, the char siew bao is special with its crust, but seriously not something to shout about. The char siew fillings are definitely not the best i've ever had. The rest of the items are not special too. The har gao skin is too thick for my likings and the chicken mushroom rice is worse than a home cooked one.The bill didn't come out very cheap, with this price, I'd rather dine in a better ambience and food quality dim sum restaurant. Definitely not tim ho wan

It was a 45-min wait to get a table, but the excitement of finally conquering this Michelin-starred restaurant kept us going, as we missed going to the original outlet in Hong Kong last year. The branch at Plaza Singapura is just like any typical dim sum place -- loud, no-frills and no atmosphere. Who cares --- we're here for the hero dish, the pork barbecue buns which cost SG$4.50 for 3. We had 3 orders of these and they were unlike any bbq buns I have ever tasted. The dough was toasted, with a sweet and savoury twist that worked well with the smokey meat. We tried a number of dumpling options --- all of which were good, except for the soggy wasabi fried dumplings #epicfail. Wasn't happy with the server who told me I couldn't drink my bottled water (because they charge 50 cents for their own water!!!) Would I queue again? Yes, those were buns of pure joy
3
This dimsum shop used to have a longer queue. Is it because of people getting overly satiated with the opening of other branches? Has the food quality dropped? Could it be both?I have to admit that on first try of their version of the baked pork bun, my best friend and I were disappointed. We both agreed that the Mongkok version will always be the best, although now a distant memory. Don't get me wrong, it still is ok, but we found it too sweet for our liking. But if you haven't tasted the original, you can't really know what you're missing out on. We also ordered the glutinous rice and the vermicelli roll. Again, HK versions win, hands down. So the next time another friend asked me to go here last night for a light dinner, I was intent on skipping the pork bun. We ordered congee, rice with chicken, mushroom and sausage, spinach dumpling, chicken feet, steamed egg cake and Chinese tea. To be honest, the chicken feet and congee tasted so good that they caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting a simple congee to "blow me away" but, well, yeah. It did. Two things that I wish for about THW: 1. That they add to their usual sauces, the chili garlic oil commonly found in dimsum shops in HK. They make the good taste so much nicer plus, it adheres to making the place more authentic and true to their HK heritage, IMHO. 2. That their staff didn't act so rudely by throwing the receipt at your table. I understand that they are running here and there, but that's no excuse to forego manners. Food = some average, some above average; Congee, really tasty!Service = bit on the rude sideStore cleanliness = very cleanEnvironment = place is well litTable alignment = too crowdedService = dimsum took longer to serve than congee and rice dish, and when the food came, they are piping hot; staff very attentive on refilling Chinese teaPrice = very affordableI give it a 3.5 rating.
3
Finally had the chance to try out this dim sum restaurant in Singapore, having seen so many times with long queues at the restaurants island-wide. Though not the one located in Plaza Singapura, but another branch in Toa Payoh. Seriously, what's the big deal?? The food is of mediocre standard and my biggest question is, where are the egg tarts?
2
Well, i hated queues.. so i tried it when the staff says maybe 10min or so instead of 3-4 hrs when it 1st started.. what i will sum up is that, it is absolutely possible to find similar style dim sum in the hawker centres, some passionate chefs, or tiong bahru area. So, to sum up, no big deal..
5
Passed this restaurant many times while at Plaza Sing and for days I couldn't get in as the queues were insane. My curiosity as to why this venue is saturated with customers irrespective of the time of day only heightened my need to try it out. Finally on a Sunday afternoon I managed to join the queue. Fifteen mins and in I was at a table. The menu is rather extensive and is very welcoming. Greed to try out a host of items on the menu can get you ordering way more than your wallet or stomach can handle. So beware, be smart and pick only those that excite your curiosity and taste buds. The dumplings were the finest I have had the pleasure/honor of trying. Attention to detail is astounding. Moreover the consistency, is baffling. A MUST TRY FOR ALL DIM SUM LOVERS. Expect to pay approximately 40 SGD per head.

I heard a lot of good reviews about this dim sum restaurant and managed to try it last weekend when I was there with some friends. I was told that there was always a long queue, so we decided to go there early to skip the queue. We arrived there around 11am and only had to wait for about 15 mins for our turn. However, as a person who travels around and trying different dim sum restaurants, I thought the dim sum was so-so and nothing great or special, but it was very pricey. The bakes char siew pao was supposed to be the popular dish but it was too sweet for some of us, but a few of friends loved it
4
Well, you can judge the restaurant from the queue....The char siew pau is extraordinary! Soft in inside, and crispy on the outside.The pork is well marinated and melting in the mouth...The rest of the dimsum were quite ok. They are fresh, juicy,smooth and nice.( chee cheong fan, dumpling and the rest).I just don't really like the chicken feet as i feel the taste is not daring enough if you compare with the char siew pau filling.Dun forget to end up your dimsum with sweet and refreshing osmanthus jelly.... Perfect
4
The char siew bun is the only item that live uo to its name, the rest of the dimsums are just normal which you can eat in kopidiam.the menu have such a small list of items to choose from. and the queue is long. xiao long bao is missing fron the menu too. better to just "take away" the char siew bao, and find another nice restaurant and eat with it. I will come again just for the bu
4
Baked Pork bun was v good. Chu chong fun with mayo is diffrent.remember to try congee and raddish cake. Delicious...
5
Visit this place for the baked pork bbq buns! It's worth the try. they also have good dumplings. :) Go there around 2 in the afternoon to avoid long queues.
5
It is a Michelin star restaurant where you line up - no reservations! Amazing food - a must do.
The food is great and the people watching is fantastic
4
Must try the pau and chicken feet...sauce and seasoning just perfect..Advise dont go on Sat/Sunday/Eve holiday....or be prepare to Que for atleast 45min to 1hour go on weekday between 2pm to 5pm less crowded 10mim que.happy eating
4
I suppose the queueing problem also occurred in Singapore--not only in Hong Kong. Was fortunate that we didn't have to, when we visited this place. The Baked Barbequed Pork Bun tasted similar to the ones we tried in Hong Kong--its signature dish.Nevertheless, in particular on this outlet, I find that the Sticky Rice (wrapped in lotus leaf) was a bit too sweet.In general--dining here at the mall was much more convenient from its origin in Hong Kong
3
location - just beside HDB hub, 2nd floor. it was empty when we went b'cos it was only 530pmpremise - not too bad but very tight.staff - we were served by 1 RUDE waitress with no smile on her face! telling us that we cannot have a bigger table b'cos we were only 2 pax, however, another couple had a 4 seater, so i cannot understand her comment to mefood - we ordered quite a bit for 2 pax but 2 of the dishes stood out: Pig's Liver Chee Chong Fubnn and the OSTHAMUS flower dessert. other than that, it's your typical food, nothing to shout about really.cost - yes, it is cheap. and that is what the hooha is all about to be honest, there are other better Dim Summ places in SG.crowd - mainly couples and some families.Verdict: go else where, cheap is the only reason why people say it's good. Mich Star? sorry but only the original place deserves that, the food here were prepared by Malaysian chefs, so it's just us consumers being suckers for such labels...
4
Have heard sometimes there can be a wait but not for us. This not central location is great I understand the Orchard Road on can be chaotic. Only westerner there and most tables changes 2/3 times with locals that says a lot.Loved the selection, presentation and taste. Very smart dim sum, some classics and new ones, loved it. Baked Pork Buns are a must have, so is the Steamed carrot Cake and Prawn dumplings
4
There is always a long queue even as early as 11.00am on certain days but today I decided to be patient and joined the queue . The staff is good at "crowd" control and our party of 3 was seated quite quickly. The "star" item is the baked bbq pork buns served piping hot. The service staff is responsive to our several requests of additional orders. The spring rolls with egg white is another item unique to this restaurant - although I find it a little too sweet
1
An ordinary dim sum restaurant, offered overpriced ordinary food with limited choices and poor service. A party of 2, despite having some tables that were not occupied, we were ushered to join a small table for 6 of which 4 seats were already occupied. Never had this kind of experience in Singapore. Spent a hefty sum of SGD52.00 for an ordinary dim sum dinner for 2 - Bad dining experience
5
Actually I find this restaurant by accident as I walk into plaza singapura and see such a long long queue then I search in the internet after read some comment we just want to try the dimsum there and we go back in the morning around 10am and just in time before they open. The review is so rite ...... indeed it s deliciou
1
Finally get to try this well take about Tim Ho Wan in Singapore. Well, I would not visit them again. Food is only average but price is first class. At the price, there is many similar one to pick.
4
Had to queue to get in but the line moved quickly. Orders filled in while in line and food arrived very quickly. Steamed dumplings are sensational. Great food and a must try - but the restaurant (in a shopping centre) lacks ambience.
2
We ordered the usual dim sum, like prawn dumplings (little prawns that's not up to mark), pork dumpling with shrimp (more like pork fat with little shrimp), beef ball with beancurd skin (more flour than beef, making it soggily soft), vermicelli roll with shrimp (passable, 5/10), beancurd skin roll with pork and shrimp (overpoweringly sweet, and where's the pork n shrimp?), and baked bun with BBQ pork (for once, nicely done).I can't understand the fuss about below average Dimsum. Or maybe their chef was just having a bad day?? Or maybe I'm just too picky? I think I'll just stick to Taka's Imperial Treasure
4
When Tim Ho Wan first started out in Singapore, the waiting time in the queue can be as long as 2 hours! Now that they have 2 other outlets in Singapore, the waiting time is definitely more manageable. If you have to wait more than 30 mins, I would suggest just going over to Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure for your Dim Sum fix as you can have a more relaxed and longer meal there. Among the 4 heavenly, we like the BBQ pork bun best, followed by the Mai Lai GAO ÔºàÈ©¨Êù•Á≥ï). Other dim sum worth trying are the prawn dumplings (ËôæÈ•∫Ôºåfresh prawns and thin skin), spinach dumplings Ôºàmust try!) and their braised beancurd skin. They are so delicious that you probably will go for second helping. I tried their glutinous rice in lotus leaf recently but not sure the order came out right as it doesn't taste one bit like the Á≥ØÁ±≥È∏°that I tried in HK or other dim sum restaurants. The meats were far too salty and wasn't the cooked chicken, sausage etc.. though there was a tiny piece of mushroom though... Won't try this again definitely.I also realized that Tim Ho Wan now has a takeaway menu which is good news for those who doesn't want to join the queue. But the items for takeaway are limited and they are still subject to GST. In the past, no takeaway are allowed and one can only dine in and pack their own if they want to take away (subject to GST and service charge).The seats in the restaurant aren't exactly comfortable, food are usually served very promptly, thus it's not a place where you feel comfortable lingering around after a meal. The turnover in the restaurant is very fast. I usually avaoid the peak hour as I hate the waiting... So choose to have an early lunch and dinner to save you some precious time.Tim Ho Wan is easily located at Plaza Singapura shopping mall, nearest MRT being Dhoby Ghaut MRT. If you haven't been to HK and love to try this one star Michelin rated restaurant in Singapore, it's definitely a restaurant worth visiting. After which, you can also do some shopping in the mall or take a short stroll down Orchard road

We just had to visit after researching great dumpling spots in singapore - and we were not disappointed. There was a queue but it moved along quickly and we were kept busy filling in our order form and selecting from the wide variety of choices. The food was served quickly and it was amazing! We tried about 6 different dumplings, all flavourful and so tasty. I loved the simple prawn dumplings, and the pork and shrimp were wonderful! We had the pork buns that they are famous for, very nice but I actually preferred the steamed dumplings! Worth lining up for, I loved it
4
Love their BBQ pork bun and i can never get sick of them... My 3 years old girl love their ma lai gao and she can eat almost 2 on her own...Do note that they dont take in reservation and usually need to Q before u can secure a seat.. however, it is worth it!!!! The Q moves quite fast so will be able to go in within 30 minutes even during peak lunch hour...Pics and review:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/06/eat-tim-ho-wan-westgate-singapore.htm

The best dish - Char siu bao (bbq pork filled bun)The rice with beef and egg was great. The spring rolls and shrimp dim sum were excellent. Some things were ok, like the carrot cake, probably because I've never tried it and didn't know what to expect. Overall, great dim sum meal even for the uninitiated.
5
We were fortunate to have queued for a very short 10 minutes on a weekend lunch at Tim Ho Wan Plaza Singapura. The service was efficient as they would conveniently sit you at your designated table, get your order, send it to you in a jiffy and monitor what was out and what is not. Food was great and consistent with their Hong Kong and Manila branches..favorites include the bbq pork bun and the mango pomelo dessert. Will not be tired of queuing for more!

So much hype about it and I am a dim sum lover so its just an attempt to find outService : acceptable and swiftambience - acceptable , table close to one another but its Hong Kong style so its acceptableFood - average but have to acknowledge it is served piping hotFavourite : beef ball, spring roll with seafood egg white filling, Osmanthus jellytip: they only seat you when everyone in your group has arrivedgo during off hours - before 1130AM and after 2PM to avoid the long queu

This review comes from the angle that great food exists all over the world, and so a review should not be confined to just a local experience and a local comparison. That is the spirit of tripadvisor and a review with a global reach. With this, I compare Tim Ho Wan with its price equivalent in a global sphere and I confer that this restaurant herewith in the venue of Plaza Singapura as "NOT MUCH COP".Tim Ho Wan (plaza Singapura) is on the high end of pricing for Dim Sum even in Singapore. Service is meh and lifeless (at least in hong kong there's that energy), long queuing time (for heck knows what), cramped seating arrangement (where you spend your time politely eavesdropping on everyones conversation by force. Look, PEACE is needed to accurately taste food, as SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN) and generally food that doesn't have that extra dimension. You could feel a sense of complacency in the atmosphere within its crew members and you could feel that (other than the great BBQ Bun) the pride of serving the best just isn't there. Tim Ho Wan is known for its Michelin label, which brings my expectation level to that of a Michelin dining experience (or close to, since this particular branch isn't Michelin certified I think) and though the BBQ pork bun is divine and made me feel good about living, the rest of the dishes, the service and that dining experience leaves so much gap in my satisfaction level. Great dining comes with so many factors - good atmosphere, great service, extension of services, great uncompromising delivery of food, good company, only using the freshest ingredients etc etc. Compared with the better restaurants of the world (at this price group), you can get much better value elsewhere. Again I stress - GLOBAL COMPARISON.BBQ pork, again is the saving grace of this restaurant but not much else. In the streets of KL Petaling street you can get much better chee cheong fun for tons less damage, in Hong Kong a strange backstreet cafe can serve tastier dishes with more depth, anger, tears, exuberance and all kinds of other emotion. Seeing the energetic movements of a waiter zipping around benches in a hong kong establishment in itself is entertainment while you eat. The thing with Dim Sum is, you can taste GOOD and be CRUDE and POWERING in taste like glutoneous rice, coupled with street side store atmosphere ala "The Infernal Affairs scene where they are at a street side store", or you can go exquisite dining style with great fresh ingredient reminiscent of all other MICHELIN level restaurant. This branch just doenst marry the essence and atmosphere of DIM SUM EATING nor does it have the elegance of fine dining yet the price says it is! It is a decent restaurant selling good food at best, but by the standards of GREYSKULL level of AWESOME HYPE (and price range), it really isn't that great. If I were asked to write a book or shoot a movie with my central characters in this Tim Ho Wan branch, I'd say "Don't waste muh time gov'. It aint much coppa"REMINDER - Globaaaaaaal comparison

The food is average; price is a little steep for a normal dim sum. The queue was a little long and the menu variety is very limited. Definitely not worth a return visit.
4
I like it and will be back again. The BBQ pork bun and other dishes are really good. Its an ordinary decorations nothing fancy like other restaurants but good foods. Not recommended for business meal due to lack of facility.
3
Everything else is average but the charsiew bun is indeed special.
If you were to come here for BEST DIM SUM in town, forget it if you need to wait hours to get in.
The remaining dishes are just normal standard. Not the best.

Went here for brekky, queue was just started so didn't have to wait long. The only unique & notable dish was the BBQ pork bun.
4
This is definitely worth a visit. The BBQ pork bun is heavenly (only the first time when I had it).The other heavenly dishes ...hmm ... it was fair. The service is good even during peak hour. The price for a meal is competitive.However, this is not a place to relax as I cannot find myself relaxing when I am seeing 30 people waiting outside for their turn to eat.There are many good Chinese restaurants in Singapore and comparatively, I would say that each restaurant has its own attraction. Hence, I am not too gung-ho about this restaurant though I will still visit it once in a while. My HK colleague has not even tried the place back home as there are so many different choices back there.Tip: 99% of the time, they do not mix up the orders but when it is peak period, do check what you ordered matches what you are paying for
4
The perpetual long queues I witnessed outside this restaurant every time I walked past kept me away. This one evening though, being half an hour before their last order; the queue was short. I took the opportunity to try out what the public was raving about. Although not a true-blue fan of tim sum due to the fact that I do not favour red meat, I am pleased that the outlet at least offers a variety of non-meat items. Service was swift, as befitting a tim sum joint, with the tables arranged close to each other to maximise seating capacity. Privacy is obviously not what people came for. An order chit was placed on the table where items are checked off. A pictorial description of dishes was evident on their placemats so you know what you are ordering.My choice of tim sum was wasabi salad prawn dumpling, glutinous rice dumpling (with chicken bits), vermicelli roll with sweet and sesame sauce, pan-fried carrot cake and steamed egg cake. Dessert was mango pomelo sago. A refreshing hot barley drink washed down the food. The quality of food was good, not too oily and each dish did not exactly fill you up. Overall, a satisfying late night meal. I can also say, that if the quality of food is as consistent daily here in Singapore as it is that evening, I cannot wait to savour the same when I am in Hong Kong in the near future

Finally had a chance to eat at this singapore branch after eating and loving the HK ones a couple of times. So this is orchard road and 1st branch, there is still a queue after 1 year, but the queue moves very quickly. There were 3 of us and we had our own table, though the tables are very close to each other. If you're a couple, you have to share a table with another couple, that's how tight they pack you in hereWe of course ordered the BBQ pork buns. Crispy yet soft on the outside, with a nice sugary taste, and the insides filled with a generous oozing serving of well-BBQed pork. Very goodWe tried the other chef recommendations and signatures dishes: - vermicelli roll with pig liver, average- crystal dumpling with truffle, with no hint of truffle whatsoever- chicken feet - good- glutinous rice dumpling - average- carrot cake - averageI think the trip is worth it for the BBQ pork bun alone, and the rest are fillers. Overall, it's only $20 per person for lunch and these days, this is considered chea

Earlier this year I was in HK with my girlfriend searching for this restaurant. After a long search we finally found it and enjoyed it so much. Today I was just strolling around Singapore and I did not even know that Tim Ho Wan opened here as well, so this time no need to search, queue up, order an enjoy:-). My buns did not have the quantity of meat in there which I expected, but other than that I enjoyed it. I am still in town for four days, so I might go back for a 'last supper

After months of waiting, in the hopes that the crowds would die down gradually, I finally got to eat this Hong Kong style dimsum at Michelin Star Tim Ho Wan. Even though there was a long queue filling up all the seats at the waiting area, as well as beyond the queue-line set up, the line moved pretty fast and soon Edwin* and I were ushered to a table. In fact, we already selected the items we wanted on the order form while waiting in liine. The interior of Tim Ho Wan is brightly-lit with a very open dining concept, filled with diners happily digging in over chatter.The first item was served shortly after we sat down - the Baked Buns with BBQ Pork. In fact, we looked around, nearly every table ordered this signature item. The exterior of the bun was somewhat crumbly and fluffy, and the sweet-salty pork oozing out from the bun's centre was tender and simply lovely.Next, another item from the Big 4 Heavenly Kinds list - the Pan-fried Carrot Cake - which was crispy on the outside and fine on the inside. The carrot and radish flavors were very prominent here and one could actually find tiny bits of carrot and radish within the pan-fried pastry itself.We had the Glutinuous Rice Dumpling - it smelled so good when it was being served so *Edwin and I eagerly tore the pandan leaf apart to attack the delicacy. While the dumpling was filled generously with tender pieces of meat and shiitake mushroom, we were a little disappointed that the rice was a tad soggy and the entire dumpling tasted rather bland.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/dinner-at-tim-ho-wan-restaurant-plaza.htm

Wow, the queue here was really unbelievable. But the food was average - not as fantastic as one would expect, looking at the queue. Again we were sort of being rush along because of the crowd outside. Not a place for a leisurely breakfast or meal
4
It is a must try for their pork bun and osmanthus jelly However, some of their monthly special is not to my liking.
4
We have visited the restaurants at Plaza Singapura and Toa Payoh Branch. a few of the signature items were great but some are just as good elsewhere. i believe its the value that forms the Qs.
5
I'm not really a fan of long queues, but then again, who is. The dim sum over here is a must try because they provide real quality handmade food unlike other outlets that is not worth mentioning. It's a no nonsense restaurant as you sit down, take your order, eat your food and pay. Will be returning for their pork buns. My wife really appreciates the jelly

Words like ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù, ‚Äúnot worth a visit‚Äù roll off the tongues of Tim Ho Wan‚Äôs naysayers. Sure, you can cavil at its operations ‚Äîlong waiting time; service standards which at times can be sublime for a casual eatery‚Äî but one thing you cannot deny: most of its dim sum dishes are laudable. Three other outlets have sprung up in just one year following the launch of the flagship at Plaza Singapura in April 2013. What was believed to be initial hype surrounding the then nascent outlet has yet to peter out. Snaking queues are still a common sight on a weekday morning and the establishment experiences an endless flurry of activity from day to night.Surely the establishment is getting its dim sum right. The following dishes make me a willing repeat customer. The Baked Bun with BBQ Pork ($4.50) is simply sui generis. The exterior is a sweet, crumbly dome. Pry into it and wisps of steam will billow ‚Äîa positive sign. How hot a dim sum dish is when it is served is a litmus test: cold dim sum will never measure up. What then ensues is the outflow of luxurious pork filling. Sweet but not cloying, the meat is diced into petite cubes.I have been to Tim Ho Wan several times now and it is just so fun watching my friends take their first bites of the mother of all buns. A glint enters their eyes and excitement sweeps their faces‚Ä¶ that is usually followed by coos and nods of approval. For all dim sum aficionados, this is the one dish you have to savour.

We had eaten at Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong and were excited to hear they'd opened in Singapore. While the lines weren't quite as long, it was still a 55 minute wait for a table. Of course, it's the Pineapple Pork Buns that are the reason many come here, but the other items are just as tasty. And yes, they're worth the 55 minute wait
4
I have always wanted to try this restaurant (branch of the Michelin 1 starred restaurant in HK) but put off by the long queues. However, I got a table after less than 15 minutes of waiting in the queue. Service was efficient and food was served very promptly. The famous baked char siew buns and steamed egg cake were excellent and lived up to the hype. The vermicelli rolls were also very good but the other dishes including the siew mai, har gao and wasabi salad prawn dumplings were a bit too salty for me. This ambience was typical of a dim sum restaurant. Tables were quite close to each other but not too uncomfortable. Surprisingly, we only paid less than $20 per person.I would definitely come back to this restaurant for dim sum
4
Having been put off by the queues outside the Plaza sing outlet it was months after the renowned dim sum reached our shores that I finally had a chance to try it.I visited the bedok mall outlet just before opening time at 11. A queue had already formed but we were all quickly seated within five minutes. I noticed a few empty tables still available. The staff were friendly and service was efficient. In fact it was like having fast food as we were in and out under half an hour which suited us fine as our parking was almost out of time. Love the signature char siew baked buns! We also had the century egg porridge, carrot cake, chee cheong fan, laksa dumplings, lotus rice and one or two more. I felt the quality pretty good though my brother and sis in law found the one they went to in HK cheaper and better. Will I go back? Sire as long as I don't have to queue for more than 15 mins
3
The buzz is there - small restaurant, new, strict queuing policy to create the rah rah.After trying almost every dim sum on offer, here us the review.The much touted baked char siew bun is pretty ok but not fantastic. The ones at Wah Lok are better.The siew mai and har gao are ordinary. The rolled flour dim sum are pretty good though with wide ranging filling including pork liver.Bean curd roll is average as was the porridge.Service was quite good as staff was prompt to turn tables fast for the next customers.Price wise, on the high side
4
We were a group of 2 and had to wait in line at the Plaza Singapura branch of Tim Ho Wan for only 10 mins (there were over 10 people ahead of us but they were in groups of 4 or more and had a longer wait). We were seated on a longer table for 6, but already occupied by 4 other customers.There's a only a limited number of choices. We tried Har Gao, Prawn Cheong Fun (wrapped in rice flour and drizzled in soy sauce), fried carrot cake, Century Egg-Pork Congee and their signature Char Siew Buns. The latter 2 stood out - the sweet confectionary covering the char siew buns was heavenly, and the rice in the congee was grated till it was soupy in texture. Other dishes we so-so. Service staff were not particularly courteous or helpful/talkative (typical in Singapore) and only there to ensure you order fast, eat and leave, so they can serve more customers.If I were to return, I'd avoid the so-so dishes
5
We went to Tim Ho Wan at the recommendation of the hotel manager. After hearing about the long line, we went there at 10.45 am on a weekday. The restaurant was already packed and there were ten people waiting in line. Fortunately within a couple of minutes we got our table.We ordered baked bun with BBQ pork, steamed egg cake, vermicelli roll with pig's liver, har kou, siew mai, glutinous rice in lotus leaf, pork bean with black sauce and wasabi shrimp dumpling. The baked buns with BBQ pork are to die for. They were so good!! The bun was soft and the BBQ pork inside was very flavorful. I noticed the vermicelli roll (cheong fun) was thinner than most that I have ever eaten. So were the har kou skins. Even when they cooled down, the vermicelli skins were not chewy but soft because they were very thin. This is what separates Tim Ho Wan from other dim sum restaurants, the ability to make very thin skin. The wasabi shrimp dumplings were crispy outside and not oily inside. Similarly the siew mai was not oily. At first I thought they were using chicken instead because the meat was white but I was told it was pork. I suspected it was very lean pork because it was not greasy. Lastly, we did not feel thirsty at all afterwards unlike many other dim sum places we have been to before. Service was very good and efficient. Tim Ho Wan is definitely worth the wait for the excellent non-greasy dim sum. But go before 11 am to avoid the queue
3
The tim sum served here is okay but nothing to write home about. Better food available from elsewhere without the long queue and noisy ambience.
3
Tried the new outlet at bedok mall... The food was just average coffee shop dim sum standard, nothing fantastic... In summary, the quality doesnt justify the price... The saving grace was probably their good customer service...
5
When Tim Ho Wan was first awarded a Michelin star in Hong Kong, we spent about 7hrs queuing for a meal. We counted it as part of our holiday - just sat and enjoyed the street life - and the food was so good, cheap and plentiful that we forgot the wait as soon as we sat down. The Singapore mall recreation is not the same experience, but the food was excellent and still very good value (7 dishes and tea was about S$40). Plus we only waited 30 min this time - the service is efficient and pleasant. We are consider in returning for another pork bun fix before returning home :
4
Finally made it to Tim Ho Wan, the Wan (one) at Westgate Jurong. Food was ok. We ordered lots, ate all we ordered, so we shouldn't complain, still we were left with itches that didn't get scratched. But to be fair, it's hard to put Michelin stars to Asian meals. I've eaten at a few Michelin-starred Asian restaurants and have gone away feeling that the whole Michelin star thing for Asian restaurants just isn't quite right. Anyway, food was over-rated though service was pretty good and efficient - maybe a tad too efficient with waitresses coming to the table every now and then to check on the status of our orders. Chinese restaurant wait staff obviously have a lot to learn about the art of being invisible! Clearly the one winning dish is their char-siew polo bao - trust me, that is one dish to die for. That is one dish worth waiting in line for
3
We were recommended this place by one of the staff in the hotel. Don't be afraid of the queue, you will be given a table quickly. The food is typical Yum Cha, however there are subtle flavours - the pork buns are almost sweet bread style.It was an interesting experience (based on the more traditional China Town Dim Sum experiences) in the sense of the rapid delivery of the food (as opposed of the more traditional trolleys being wheelled around the restrauant). Would I go back - not sure. Perhaps if I had a craving for Yum Cha and I was in the vicintiy. I think this place is trading off its "newness" and the owner has been awarded a Michillin star
4
the food was something different. haven't been able to try this resto in HK...the fried bun is a must try as well as the other dimsum dishes...line was long but was moving quite fast...it was an afternoon snack that we were after since we had just arrived...not too pricey.8 pax sgd90 considering it was a heavy snack...:
1
The food is good, but the overall experience is marred by the poor customer service received. The staff spilt tea onto me and could offer a 'oh, is it hot?'. Though serviettes were provided shortly after, they had to be told to wipe the wet floor which it was slippery. After requesting for the bill, I highlighted the incident to the staff and told them that I had to get home to change as a result of the incident. The staff retorted with a nonchalant attitude and had the temerity to state that it was just tea and isn't sticky; insinuating that I was lying. I asked the staff if she wanted to validate my claim by touching my attire and she kept quiet. The staff then followed up with an unapologetic question: a 'so what do you want me to do?'. Horrible horrible experience. They should reflect on themselves and ask if they have trained their staff sufficiently to handle such situations. I'm disappointed with such deplorable service standards and attitudes and am pretty sure I won't be visiting this chain of restaurants again. Any restaurant worth its salt should be equipped to handle such situations to make the customer feel at ease
2
After months of hearing raving reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. Food was just average at best. The only saving grace is the Pork bun which is quite good. The rest of the Dim Sum just went downhill. Price versus taste, you can find better Dim Sum around for a half the price
3
Out of curiousity, why the long snake Q n Facebook status I got recently for the past few months so decided to give it a try at the Westgate outlet todayWaited 20mins n got our table for 3 paxOrdered 13 choices Food quite ok but so so only Nothing superb at allService ok Price above average Enjoyed the Steamed Egg Cake, Pan fried carrot cake, Glutinous Rice,Osmanthus Cake(Dessert),Baked BBQ pork bun out of the 13 choicesWorth a visit for a new experience

I've reviewed my sad experience while dining at the Toa Payoh outlet. Just as I thought things couldn't get worse, it did - at the Tim Ho Wan Westgate, Jurong in Singapore.I joined the queue that was snaking around the entrance. After 20 minutes, I was still about 10th in line to be served, It was the lunch hour crunch and diners were sitting easy after their meal and not in a hurry to leave.. Still in my 10th position after another 5 minutes or so, I approached the Queue Controller (thats the only QC component applicable to them in my vocabulary).I asked that dine-in patrons in the queue be identified so that those in line for takeaways can place their order. Why? Because existing diners are content to laze around after their meals and not vacating their tables, dine-in patrons can't be admitted. Takeout patrons, however, should be allowed to place their orders in such a circumstance. That way, things can keep moving. Takeout patrons don't need a table... and tables are not being vacated.Tim Ho Wan's reply is that, even for takeout orders, you need to join the queue, wait for your turn, sit on a table, order tea, while you wait for your order to be filled.Its the Season To Be Merry! I'm sure lots of Tim Ho Wan's competitors are having a tummy aching guffaw over this
4
i visited the outlet in toa payoh central at era building. went on a sunday evening for dinner and a snaking queue greeted our family. decided to return again on monday afternoon around 2 plus. good idea as we were ushered in immediately. standard menu, like in hong kong. quality is similiar but prices are a lot higher. the bbq pork bun, carrot cake, cheong fun and glutinous rice did not disappoint. very yummy. but sitting is very hong kong style. cramp and you are practically sitting alongside strangers. the service staff however were very much friendlier and helpful than in hong kong
3
I find the price over-rated even though the food are quite good. The best is the BBQ pork bun. The rest of the food are just average. I ordered quite a number of items & I couldn't finished it. I asked the staff to pack them for me. To my surprised that she passed me a box & plastic bag for me to pack on my own. I thought this is a basic service that they should provide since we pay for the service charge. Not only that, when she was pouring water for the customer next to my table, she spilled some water onto my side. She didn't even apologise, wipe the floor & walked away
3
If I'm in Singapore and I'm craving THW, I make sure I queue on weekday and at 9:30. I'll definitely seated right away at 10:00 and order the pork bun right away. I've tried other dishes and I can find others serving them better. The fried egg white is somehow nice and you should order it too. Overall, the price was not that cheap and the pork bun is to die for
4
This is the first store in Singapore. The dim sum is more expensive and smaller portion that that in Hong Kong, but good quality nonetheless. Their Char Siew Bao and Gultinous rice are must tries. The taste is unique to the store. Other dishes are so-so, but freshly prepared and steamed upon order. The queues are amazing at this branch. If you are able to venture out of the city area, try their other branch at Toa Payoh. The queues will be shorter. Otherwise, be prepared to wait 30 min to 1 hr to get in. And no takeaway orders at this branch. Hopefully when the hype dies down, takeaways of the yummy char siew bao will be allowed
4
We decided to try this restaurant because of all the hype that we read over the Internet regarding it being the cheapest restaurant awarded with a Michelin star. We were expecting very long waiting lines but fortunately for us, we only had to wait for 30 mins to be seated. We ordered so much food because we were starving that time. Good thing service was really quick. The food is okay although a little bit pricey. The only one that really impressed us are the pork BBQ buns. They were perfect- very savory filling. Since we ordered too much, we got to bring home the leftover buns. To our pleasant surprise, they still tasted great even after several hours. We didn't even have to heat them. We might come back just for these buns alone when we visit Singapore again
4
Tried getting in there once, but public holidays are not a good time to try. Brought my mother there on a regular Monday for lunch as she works in the area. Second time lucky--we queued for 30 minutes as the queue was not that long at 11.45am. Ordered the beef items to try them out and I must say that the beef balls are good--savoury with a touch of citrus on top. The char siew pau had sweet pastry, so if you don't like sugar with your pork, it might not be for you. (I can have two or more buns if I didn't have the rest of the lunch to eat.) The spinach and garlic dumplings and the fried carrot-cake were good--they were served hot and also allows for a vegetarian option. The rice flour rolls were lukewarm when they got to us, which did not add to the experience. The Osmanthus jelly cubes were refreshing after all that food. It was around $45 for two people, drinks, GST and service charge all in
4
Most of the dim sum dishes consist of prawns and I must say that the prawns are pretty fresh. Taste is not really that fantastic as most reviews claimed, but ok not too bad. There were four of us (adults), and we ate most of the recommended dishes, cost us about $20 each person
3
the first few times I passed by Tim Ho Wan at Plaza Singapura, I was way too tempted to really cue because of the long lines of people patiently waiting for their turn to be seated.Finally, I had the guts to cue last week since the line wasn't that long enough. Hubby and I were immediately given a seat since there was just the two of us so we actually had overtaken the others on cue.When our food finally came, yes, they were good dimsum, but I have tasted quite a few number of dimsum which apparently tasted just the same.It was a good experience though but I don't mind not being able to go back there anymore
2
I went toa poyah branch , the queue was long , waited 30 mins, we will ushered In and made to sit in seat that we do not want , but have no choice , sitting right next to the food counter, with the waitress spilling the food infront of us.The food is ridiculous overpriced ,charging restaurant price too ,and saltish and soggy .They are in a hurry to get us out after our meal, all the food came together and it turns old pretty cold.Whatever it is I will never go back again, there are so many nice dim sum out there.I don't need to eat these outrageous overpriced soggy saltish dim sum
3
First off I thought the food was good and service was reasonably fast particularly given the place was full packed right from opening. I came quite early on a public holiday so from the time I arrived 'til I got my seat was just about half an hour. I ordered the pork buns and siew mai. While the food was ok, it was certainly not "knock me out of my socks good" however way I look at it. So definitely not something I would queue for much longer than what I experienced. As I was exiting I caught a glimpse of what was now perhaps more than an hours worth of queued people. While I respect that some people have varying opinions on what is exactly queue worthy food, I think most people here are simply caught up in the hype. As for myself and whether I would come back? Possibly but not if I had to queue again
4
Prepare to wait 1 hour during lunch/dinner hours.
The bun and siomay are as good as in HK, but the vegetable hakau and bacang are not.
5
The pork buns alone are worth the line up! Service was a little rushed but the food and prices were fantastic!!
4
The BBQ pork buns here definitely live up to their Michelin star. They are light and crispy on the outside, yet soft, warm and moist on the inside. My friends and I couldn't stop eating them.As for the other dishes, some were quite good, but others a little disappointing. I enjoyed the prawn dishes in particular - such as the prawn har gow and prawn chee cheong fun, as the seafood inside was really fresh.Didn't like the beef balls though, as the spices in there were really quite strong and i didn't like the taste.To see some pictures of the food and read more in-depth, check out my blog post: http://www.prischew.com/food/good-michelin-starred-dim-sum-tim-ho-wan
4
Expect a really long queue, even at the Toa Payoh neighborhood branch. I think the only off peak time is 3-5pm. I like how they have modified some of the dishes like the BBQ pork bun with crispy skin and the Carrot cake having some Lup Cheong inside. Adds a bite more twist to Singapore's common expected dim sum. Slightly pricier, but good award winning dim sum!Skip the monthly specials (which taste like my dog's armpit. wait how would I know what that tastes like? HMM.) and go for their popular dishes.Chef Cheung has also indicated the next outlet will have more local infusion dim sums, so do look forward to it!For mind blowing dim sum photos and review click below:http://sethlui.com/food-review-tim-ho-wan-singapore-toa-payo
3
The Char Siew Pau is a combination of Buo Lo pau pastry with char siew filling. The bun is fluffy and soft but I find the fillings tad too sweet. The more you eat, the sweeter it gets as the bun is also sweet. What I love most is their Century Egg Congee... Very traditional Cantonese taste, smooth with just the right amount of seasoning. Brilliant! The bean curd skin roll is fresh and crispy. Har Kau is good, soft while the skin doesn't stick to the teeth. Unfortunately Beef ball is a total flop... Tasted more like a mushy blotch of floured meat. Couldn't taste any beef at all! Chee cheong fun's skin is too thick. Doesnt qualify as a Michelin star dish.Overall, the dim sum is good, not sth that you can get anywhere in sg but I wouldn't say it's such a great eatery place that worth an hour queue.

Tim Ho Wan received tons of hype and press for opening it's first outlet in Singapore at Plaza Singapura, afterall this is the very first well-known HK dim sum restaurant that is opening an overseas store. Went to check it out on a Saturday afternoon and to my dismay the queue was absurdly long. Looking at how crowded the place was and how so many people were willing to wait quietly in line, I decided to test my tolerance as well as I believed that the good dim sum was worth the wait. Waited in line for over an hour and 30 minutes before I finally got a table. Ordered it's most famous BBQ buns, fried carrot cake, har gao, siew mai, cheong fun and glutinous chicken and wasn't disappointed. The BBQ buns were delightfully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The crispyness complemented the bbq pork very well and it was a pity how only 3 buns were allowed per person. The fried carrot cake and siew mai were great treats as well. I left a satisfied customer food-wise on my first visit. Upon the second visit, the food suddenly didn't taste as great as they were the first time round and I found it absolutely a hassle to queue like a fool just for the food. Value wise it's alright but you'd be better off eating the real deal in Hong Kong for a quarter of the money.To sum up : Good food that is probably worth a 30 to 45 minute wait, definitely not over an hour though. It's getting kind of overrated recently with the queues and hype
5
We are a party of 4, but since 1 of us is still not present, we were not allowed to enter even if we are next in line. I think this is just fair, so not to waste time waiting inside. So love the polo bun and the ha kaw and glutinous rice. Everything was served hot from the stove. Will come back again
3
I am sure many reviews would be also mentioning this word - Overrated.BTW THIS IS NOT A MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANT! ONLY THE MAIN STORE IN SHAMSHUIPO, HONG KONG IS!!! Very poor and misleading marketing phrases used by them.When this first started in Singapore, the queue was easily 2 hours. Now we only spent 30mins queuing even though is lunch time so that is why we decided to try it.Anyway, I will share quickly what is really good and what is ok and bad.Excellent: BBQ Char Siew Buns, Rice rolls (any type), Osmanthus cake/dessert..you just got to try it to know how delicious they are!Ok: Siew Mai and Steamed Malay Cake - just make do with it to fill your tummyBad: Glutinous rice - overcooked with no flavourWe were served by this lady call Mimi (a middle aged lady) - SUPERB service from her. Like to say thanks via Tripadvisor.Other than that, I will not visit this place again even if there is zero queue
4
I think it'so busy because of the publicity generated n it's still quite new in town, dim dum quality is reasonably good but I won't say it's the best in town, menu is also very limited. However, the bbq pork polo buns are out of this world, a must-try
2
I went there because my friend came back from Aussie and wanted to try it, I would never queue for more than 10 min for any food, but since my friend wanted to try it, i was there at 3.30pm on a Saturday. As my friend was slightly late and was not with me, the waitress did not even bother to give me the order menu and totally ignored me. Horrid first impression of the service.The famed char siew bun was way too sweet for my liking, har kou and siew mai is ok, I can get these at any higher end Cantonese restaurant with the same price. The silliest thing is that we were told that we cannot buy take away, so they provide styrofoam boxes and plastic bags to you so that they can serve you the dim sum on a plate to you table then you pack them into the styrofoam boxes they provided. Which we find was outrageously ridiculous. Oh one more thing as I did not know that this is a michillan restaurant in the beginning until we queue to pay for the food, my non impression about the food is totally non-bias. I would give the food 3 1/2 star, and take 2 stars out for the rude and then ridiculous rules imposed on its customers.Not coming back anytime soon. That's my conclusion

be ready to queue, it open at 10 in the morning but there were line queueing since 9 in the morning. Go for the Pork Bun, it is very delicious.

Full reviews and photos: http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com/I had a lot of expectations for Tim Ho Wan, because of all the buzz created about it. Authentic Hong Kong dim sum and a Michelin Star restaurant, just thinking about all the dim sum like baked char siew buns, chee cheong fun, siew mai and har gow just made me drool. But when I finally tried it, I was a little disappointed. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the food was good, but just not ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù.First, the baked char siew buns. I realised it‚Äôs either you hate it or you love it. For me, I really disliked the cloying sweetness of the char siew fillings, it was just too much for me, and so I struggled to finish the bun. The second time I didn‚Äôt give up on it and ordered it again, hoping it was just an one-off slip in standard, then I realised, nope, this is simply how the baked char siew bun tastes for Singapore. (Apparently the main chef adjusted their recipe according to Singaporeans‚Äô preferences, failed on me though.) But of course, it‚Äôs really just about personal preferences.To be honest, I think the har gow, or prawn dumpling, was very ordinary. In fact, the skin was slightly soggy and broke too easily, and hence I felt that it was in fact inferior to the har gow from Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade. The siew mai scored better, because the taste of prawn and meat fused together nicely, but it was still not amazing.One of my favourites at Tim Ho Wan though, is this ordinary-looking and often underrated dim sum ‚Äì the shrimp chee cheong fun. Tim ho wan‚Äôs shrimp chee cheong fun contains the garlic chives (gau choy/Èü≠Ëèú), and the fragrance of the garlic chives enhances the overall smell and taste of the chee cheong fun. The prawn used was also very fresh and succulent, and my friends and I enjoyed it so much that we ordered another plate of it.The second dim sum that thoroughly impressed me was the steam beancurd skin roll , which is actually pork and prawn fillings wrapped in beancurd skin. It‚Äôs so good! Seriously. The beancurd skin has its own unique taste, and when steamed, the juice of the meat and prawn is absorbed by the bean curd skin, creating this extremely juicy meat taste when you bite into the skin. Very, very satisfying. Note, order the steamed one, not the deep fried bean curd roll, because the flavour and juiciness is completely lost in the latter.As for the rest of the dim sum, I really think they‚Äôre good but not that outstanding, because Imperial Treasure delivers similar standards for their dim sum, just without the annoying long queues.Full reviews and photos: http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com

Hi. Went there about 915pm and there were 2 groups of peeps still waiting as they were 4-5 people in those groups.The queue during peak hour seem endless as they stretch rather long. I wouldn't queue for more than half an hour for food so that's my own personal opinion.Dim sum was tasty and the BBQ pork bun is presented in a crusty bun but yet delicious. Prices are reasonable since its in orchard after all

Went there for brunch with the family and loved it ! Similar set up to the original branch in Mong Kok Hong Kok but on a larger scale and with much more efficient and friendly service. Had to wait about 30 min for our table but it is worth it just to eat their char siu baos! They have a limit of 3 pieces per person thank goodness, otherwise I would have eaten more!Not a place you sit around after eating, they like to move you on ad there is usually a line of people waiting to get in but well worth going to

We waited for the dim sum (about 1 hour) and I thought it was OK - we could take turns shopping and waiting in line. The service was friendly and the food arrived rather quickly. The food was fantastic and here's an item-by-item review:The four "heavenly kings" from the menu:1. The char siew buns are even better than the reviews have claimed. The pastry is wonderfully light and just crisp enough. The generous char siew filling is tasty with juicy tender pieces of meat. 2. Malaigo (steamed cake) - very light texture with just the right amount of sugar. 3. Liver cheongfun - the cheongfun was very smooth and the liver filling was nicely cooked with tender pieces of liver.4. Lo bak go (turnip cake or "carrot" cake according to Singaporeans) - Again the texture is smooth and you can acutally taste the turnip. It was just adequately salted - not too salty - which is perfect. Other items:Siew mai : the best I've had - there is a smooth and succulent mouthfeel to it. There was an interesting addition of a goji berry on top (rather than crab roe or carrot or a red ink spot) which imparted a slightly sweet note to the siew mai. Har gau - there was a lovely thin skin and such a lovely juicy prawn filling, one of the best, if not the best I have had.Spare ribs with black beans - the pork was cooked to perfection - very tender.Century egg, salted egg and pork porridge - very delicious. My mother says it tastes like the good porridge from days gone by. My British friend, who does not eat eggs, ate half the bowl. Spring rolls with egg white - very crisply fried and the filling remained moist. Chicken's feet - very tasty but not as outstanding as the other dishes.Beef balls - the texture was good but the flavours were a bit weird - the orange peel overpowered it a bit. My sister liked it very much though.Lo Mai Gai (glutinous rice) - deliciously flavoured rice. Desserts:Osmanthus jelly - beautifully flavouredYam with sago - a lovely rich yam paste mixed with coconut milk. Very fragrant and not too sweet.Overall experience:The food was excellent. I have eaten dim sum around the world from places such Hong Kong (but not Tim Ho Wan), London, Manchester, Singapore, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, New York, LA, San Francisco, Washington DC, Vancouver, Toronto.... but this is the best so far. I guess the original Hong Kong THW outlets would have even better food but that will have to wait for my next trip there. Singaporeans are food lovers and they aren't stupid. If the food isn't top-notch, why would people be waiting for up to 3 or 4 hours for a meal

Decided to check out THW on a weekday hoping the wait would be shorter. But the wait was still about 2 hours. The restaurant is not very big which may be a reason why the queue is so long. The service is above average. They have ample waiters and waitresses. They also tried their best to help those waiting in line feel comfortable - ensuring those who were waiting outside get to come in as soon as the queue allows it. The menu at THW is rather limited. Of the four recommended dishes (Big 4 Heavenly Kings) we tried 2 - baked buns with bbq pork and carrot cake. THW's infamous baked buns are indeed very good. The best in Singapore. As for the carrot cake it is also good. The prawn dumplings are also one of the best in Singapore. I find their Spring rolls with egg white to be quite impressive and delicious. Tried only one dessert dish - Tonic Medlar & Osmanthus Cake (cold). Quite like it. Overall it is a good caf√© selling good tim sum dishes. However considering that it is more like a caf√© then a high end restaurant, the price is a little on the high side. Overall we had a good afternoon and enjoyed our meal. Be prepared to wait so do not join the queue when hungry

We queued up before the restaurant open and waited 1.5hours with a long line beginh us. Similar to my experience in HK, only the char siew bao was worthwhile. Rest of dim sum so-so only. But surprised with the nice and friendly service despite the crowd.

Landed up on a Sunday evening having heard praises for this small eatery. It is a good place to visit if you are in the vicinity.I was forewarned of long wait, so was prepared as were several others. We reached some time after 7 pm.We waited economy(standing) then business (seated on plastic chairs) lastly 1st class (on wooden chairs) for about 45 minutes after 7 pm.in the waiting area ,on the walls they have plastered the extensive coverage in local media before their launch in April 13.We ordered a lot more than three of us could eat.9 dishes which were recommended. Egg cake-unexpectedly sweet in the middle of the meal, carrot cake, teochew dimsum, mushroom spinach dimsum for vegetarians, prawn dimsum, Chicken Rice with sausage, Vermicilli roll and BBQ Pork buns.Of the lot the pork buns were the best, then the rice followed by the mushroom spinach dumpling which I am told were created for Singaporeans who would not eat meat. The other food was average.The tables are smallish as also the chairs and is bit of a crush designed so, I guess so that one doesn't linger around, after eating. The food arrives promptly as you have to pre-order at the entrance with the captain of the waiting area. The Chinese tea was flavorless and we should have ordered something else. We requested for take away (TaoPao) and were given 2 coffee shop Thermocol boxes. One suggestion if the mgt reads such stuff from laypeople;If I was the Manager and the star of my restaurant was the BBQ Bun,I would surely not allow three buns to be squeezed inside the run of the mill boxes used by hawkers. Will I go again...yeah not a bad place. The staff is nice and don't make any mistakes,though you feel morally obliged to eat and go. The Michelin Star can be discounted, having eaten at some others with this star, this isn't one of the top end but it is a good place to go

I went to this restaurant on Wed -25th June. Queue for an hour+.The food is nice and value for money. If you don't mind to wait and queue. This is ok place to try. Dim sum very nice especially BBQ bun and fried carrot cake. Space is very narrow and number of table limited. Not as describe in their website. Overrated despite being cheapest Michelin star.Tim Ho Wan should consider open another outlet soon with bigger space. Current space not suitable for family with young children.If you are couple and love dim sum. This place should not be missed, but if you are more to service and spacious. This is definitely not the place.Put this into consideration if you are choosing this for dim sum. Nothing fancy. Just nice for the rate as no service restaurant

Just gone to THW restaurant in plaza singapura on Wednesday. After hearing rave reviews about the food.. And it was touted as the cheapest Michelin star restaurant. The queue was crazily long. We waited for almost 1 hour to get seated... I was told it is worse during week ends.The 4 heavenly dishes are... Crispy bo luo cha siew bao. It has really nice texture, full of cha siew, and tasted really good. Although I think it's a little bit too sweet. However the kids love it.Egg steam cake. I think it's very good. Soft and fluffy.. And sweetness is just nice.Vermicelli roll with pigs liver. It's interesting... But its not for me. Unless you are a pigs liver fan, the way it's cooked and rolled into the roll just doesn't appeal to me.Fried carrot cake. This is very good. Soft and tasty, not too salty. Other dishes that we ordered are...Siew mai.. It's good.. Better than most places.Har gow, (prawn dumpling), it's quite average I thinkLuo mai gai (glutinous rice with chicken) wrapped in lotus leaf. This dish is very good! FavouriteBean curd skin with prawn rolled in.. Deep fried.. This is good!Beef balls, steamed, this is quite nice.. Some orange peel inside. Nice and soft and chewy.. But my kids did not like it.Century eggs porridge, quite average.Overall quite nice, but the queue is a bit of put off. Otherwise it's a nice place for dim sum. The menu is limited, but they are good dishes
