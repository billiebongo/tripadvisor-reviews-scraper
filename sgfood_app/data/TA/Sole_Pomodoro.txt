I really liked the food here and it's right on the water so great people watching. Just around the corner from the W hotel so a great alternative to hotel food.
5
Great pizza and pasta with great hospitality! The view was also beautiful overlooking the marina! Worth a vist!
5
Very good service as we went very late and still helped us with some pizzas like ham and rucola. Delicious! The place is simple but confortable and waitress very friendly.

Following a cruise, I was staying at the Singapore W just a short distance from this restaurant. Because we had been eating "in" every night on the cruise we decided to eat out. We walked along the Quayside Isle and inspected several restaurants but decided it would be nice to eat Italian. All of the other restaurants were very busy but just a few customers in Sole Pomodoro and now I know why. This so-called "Italian" restaurant fell far short of our expectations. The shared antipasto starter was reasonable but badly presented. For my mail course I had the king sized prawns which were over-cooked and made separating the flesh from the shells almost impossible. My friend had chicken which again was over-cooked and would not have been out of place in an Indian restaurant. The service was poor and the food overpriced for what it is
3
We took our friends to this restaurant and beside it was raining, it was nice to sit down outside covered by a roof with nice big fans.The food was ok, the pizzas looked great but I think they should be more crispy and were missing more amount of food in these ones. They were Ok but not a wow.The carpaccio’s size was just small, it would be nice just to have this one a little bit bigger as size. Taste was nice! Food came very fast. The pasta was good and my calzone was just ok, not too much filling.Service was proper and price was according to the product.It is fine but I will not go back, perhaps will try the other restaurants in the area
5
We go there with our friends and families and one main reason is that the service by the ladies from Philipine origin as well as Owner of Restaurant is attentive enough plus we feel they know us. Luxury is going to a place where you do not need to read the menu and the staff knows what you like. The pizza is probably the best we know here in Sentosa, salads they need to work on and probably price lower as the portion is small and it is not a great salad, Calzone is my friends favorite mine is a more regular one, the kids also have the pasta there, be mindful, pricing is a little high, but quality is there. It is also the sort of place where you would go sit at the side walk and have a nice glass of wine or beer and watch the people go by We will continue to go there as it is pleasant to sit there with family and friends
2
Service was slow, food is overpriced, portions are small...food is ok, some hits, some misses...pizza dough was undercooked and the toppings kept falling off, seafood spaghetti was fishy and “al dente” was objectively undercooked, steak was on the dry side...calamari was good but portion was ridiculously small for the price...won’t be going back
5
Ate here multiple times during our stay and WOW! Amazing service, amazing food. Little bit pricey but totally worth the cash. Pizza is wood oven and fresh with a nice thin base. Antipasto platter is generous and has a good selection of fresh ingredients would highly recommend eating here 10/10
4
Located next to W resort, we went here for a quiet and easy meal with the kids. The meals were fresh and tasty. If your looking for amazing food this probably isn't the place to be but for a casual dinner without the fuss, it's great! Oh and they offer 10% discount for W guests
3
We were staying next door at the W hotel and saw this restaurant early in our stay. The menu looked good and it was always busy so we went there on our last evening. Unfortunately the service was poor. We had to wait ages for our order to be taken and even longer to get the bill. However the food was fine with the standout being the eggplant Parma. The pizza was also tasty
4
Visited the Quayside Isle area of Sentosa and found a pleasantly located pizza restaurant with relaxed indoor/outdoor dining options. Although the service was a bit slow, they tried hard, and were pleasant. Food and wine very good, unpretentious for such a stunning location.
3
Took a stroll from W and found Sole Pomodoro. We were in desperate need of some Italian food. Unfortunately, the food was just okay. But it's in a nice upmarket location, a retreat from the hordes.
4
Its linguine with clam & white wine sauce is must try, I almost lick my plate, so delicious. You can taste the white wine sauce in every piece of the linguine. Its Calamari Fritti is also yummy. However, I hope the waiter/waitress are more kind.
3
Pizzas are nothing exceptional
My grilled fish was pretty good, and the menu has a lot of choice
But overall value is pretty poor
2
We were going to eat at this restaurant one night. When we got there the waitress took us to a table she took an extra plate from the table and we set down. Then we waited....... only when we got up to leave did the waitress realise We were there and started to bring some menus. Based on this experience I wouldn't suggest it. I suggest you go to the mexican and italian place which is only two restaurants away.
5
I love Sole Pomodoro. The ambience is great. The crew are fantastic - shout out to Yanti and Jeremy in particular. Food is fresh and vibrant - really delicious. Pizza out of this world - thin, crispy and super delicious. Divola the favourite. Prices are OK - Singapore is never the cheapest, but it won't break the bank - and you are having dinner on the Marina so it feels like you are on vacation. Try it out - you will have a great time! 
4
Stayed at W hotel & decided I wanted to dine out with my family. Garlic bread for starter was delicious. I had a calzone my daughters had a Hawaiian & my wife a pasta dish. Calzone was really good, Hawaiian awesome & the pasta dish tasted great but was just a very small dish. Served super quick which was great for my girls(as they don't like waiting) & was located very near the hotel complex
1
The linguine was ok... the rest was tastless.. it is food but it has little taste even the suaces they provide are very bland.. if your after food for survival.. great... if you want a culinary experience skip this place... note we did not have the pizza.. they might be ok
3
Sorry have been a regular guest for the last 4 years , both for dining in and take away. Food has always been good but lately unfortunately quality and quantity goes in the wrong direction - pizza is now almost half the size as it used to be , price is the same , but the worst , no authentic taste ??? You can surely do better
3
Pizza was so-so. Spaghetti noodles was pretty hard. We were wondering if thats supposed to be the standard. We finished it because we were quite of a hungry bunch lol. The menu if u were wondering consists of mainly pizzas and pastas and its pricey for that food standard.
4
just facing he marina at Santosa Cove, you are on vacation .try the pizza, best in singapore. good service.
5
Beautiful view of the Marina, excellent food, friendly, helpful staff; conveniently located right next to our Hotel
3
We ate pizza and it was okay. Nice setting by the Sentosa Cove marina and friendly staff. The grade could be higher if it wasn't for the price level, which is significantly higher than your basic hawker market food in Singapore.
4
Tried the lasagne, had pizza, had salad, kids pasta. Great value, accepts credit cards, nice seating by the marina (amazing views), solid service. Well worth it - good value. Highly recommend
1
The worst Cesar and Caprese salads we tried. They did not have ravioli at the lunch time, thus we had to take salads. Considering the unreasonable price for food and beverage, tiny portions it's better to find another place for lunch or dinner.
2
Soggy French fries that were probably leftovers, really poor pizza, even by the generally poor Singapore standards. Nice bread. Really really wouldn't recommend eating here. Disappointing.
4
Been there recently for lunch on the weekend. The outdoor area has a nice view to the Marina and breezy seats under the huge fan. They also have a little kids playground which is very nice for the little ones. Food is authentically prepared and tasted good. We all had a pizza which were all pretty tasty. I know it is Sentosa Cove Quayside so I shouldn't talk about the prices but 28$ for a pizza each I find a bit too much.
5
Its by the marina with all the yacht's parked & the breeze is just lovely for/from the usual hot & humid Singapore weather. You don't have to be dressed up. Just be comfortable & enjoy your meal in a quiet & peaceful place away from the city. My second time here & I must say, I love this place for its aesthetics, atmosphere & best of all, the food. MUST TRY their wood fired pizzas & lasagna.
4
Quayside Isle Sentosa is a superb place to spend a few hours for lunch watching the world go by. After some deliberation (spoiled for choice with the numerous restaurant options) we landed on Sole Pomodoro and took a table for 6. The pizzas were excellent thin crust authentic Italian style
5
Ever been to Sentosa on a lazy working day for lunch? We did just that and avoided the crowds & the lazy overcast cool afternoon was in stark contrast to the " typical Singapore weather"!... & we were not complaining! We had the Quayside all to ourselves practically, but for the few families & babies in tow, possibly residing in Sentosa. Sad though that several restaurants and eateries were closed for lunch weekdays but once we got the see the picturesque setting of Sole Pomodoro with those quaintly painted tables & chairs, we were reminded of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings in Amsterdam! With the row of yatch parked on Quayside, we could well have been in Van Gogh land!? Coming to the food, we had Bruschetta & Burrata Cheese with Cherry tomatoes & rocket salad for Starters & settled for 4 Formaggi Pizza which was delicious beyond words! We had a Shirley Temple and bitter lime for drinks. The quiet leafy ambience, quick polite service & the few birds. chirping away in the trees provided a lazy back drop to a fabulous Italian meal. We had a memorable afternoon with my working son taking the day off to spend time with us!! No better place in Singapore to do just that, far from the maddening crowds
3
Went there few times as it was near to my working place. Food especially pizza was nice but not the Aglio Olio. Service was good and very friendly staff.
5
Tried a couple of times dining, loved the pizzas and the risotto (even though they only have the mushroom risotto). The view facing the dock is just amazing..
3
Service was okay.
Food was okay.
Price was okay.
The place is simply okay. It doesn't excel at anything. It's just... Okay
5
Just had a fantastic lunch with the family consisting of 3 pizzas and a lasagne. All were beautifully made and very tasty. The service was excellent. All in all would definitely recommend.
2
Very unhappy experience, we had two pastas, they told was for two people each, unfortunately was not even enough for two.
We will never go back there.
I went to talk to the manager, they didn't even call me to apologise
5
Sentosa Cove is a bit like a little country on its own. For our anniversary we decided to head down there and see what we can find. The restaurant we started at had bad service so we decided to go to Sole Pomodoro instead. What a blessing. Pizza was great, view is fantastic. We sat outside on the deck area. A must try in Singapore. We will definitely be back. We had our own wine we brought back from South Africa. Corkage was $30 and they opened and served it to us. Great experience
5
As an Italian, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions of the food. Had a beef carpaccio to start with a artichoke and prosciutto pizza as a main. Very filling and tasty. Dinner for two set us back S$200 with cocktails and wine. Would visit again
4
The location is special together with other restaurants just next to a yacht port that makes you feel you are at the Cote D'Azur. Nice. Nicely decorated and a big wood fired oven. All good, all the way to the burrata. Pizzas are nice, so the pasta and the Italian beer. Only downside: the prices are on the very high side, but then this is probably the corner of Singapore where prices don't matter.

I first visited solo pomodoro around 6 months ago when a friend from Sardinia hosted a party. Loved the place. In April I hosted lunch for around 15 of my friends. Location was superb - kids could run and play around near the water. Service was outstanding. Food was very good - they do the simple normal dishes but do them very well - lasagna, pizzas. Their tiramisu is very fresh and superb. Have been there 4 times since and pretty much all my friends who came for the party visited again in less than a week after my party Highly recommend!Ps: last month I was at a Greek restaurant Mykonos which is 1 restaurant away from solo pomodoro. My 8 year old wanted a particular lemonade from solo pomodoro and went across and asked the maitre de for it. Guess what - 10 mins later I see the maitre de walking across with the lemonade from solo pomodoro and served it to my Daughter who was with me at the Greek restaurant. I was blown away by the service
5
Wanted to take some guests to eat out and decided to head to Sentosa so to have a nice view of the Marina. We choose Sole Pomodoro as we walked by just because they had some nice tows available for a 3 year old to play.The service was very good and attentive at all times. The food was delicious and their tomato sauce is fantastic. We ate from Pizza to Pasta and it was all really very good. Will sure be going back for more !!! Well done , good job !!
2
Mushroom risotto and lasagne (no salad or fries served with it), a side of fries and a bottle of sparkling water for $100!! Terrible price, small portions!! The food was tasty but the price and portion size is ridiculous!
1
It's miniature sized serving portions would have been justified if the taste was good...but it didn't...
Severely understaffed as well.
$18.90 for 7 pcs of calamari...zzz
1
You don't often not finish a pizza when you have an appetite but this place did it. Mine was tasteless and the kids' margarita was equally bland. Lots of leftover, no thanks don't need a doggy bag. Avoid.
4
authentic pizza and pasta
Visited at lunch time and enjoyed the view
The pizza is a tasty thin crust and fair share of topping.
The pasta is al dente
Risotto was too cheesy
1
Food was ok, service was not great at all- slow and lacking commitment and detail. My main which was a burger came out 20 minutes after everyone else's - won't be back.
3
We had dinner with a couple and two children, ordered some mussells, pizzas and drinks, all aerved promptly, pizzas were fresh and presented well. Service was good and staff friendly and cheerful

Whilst this place looks good on the outside, entering paints a very different picture. At first glance the menu looked very interesting but unfortunately this place simply doesn't live up to even basic expectations.My partner and I visited earlier this week. As I suffer from allergies my first question was "do you have an allergen menu?" Shockingly in this day and age (and even more so being on Sentosa & on the door step of a 5* hotel like W) they didn't and when the waitress was asked whether certain dishes contained dairy, the response was "I think so". Which led me to push her to confirm by speaking to the chef. I subsequently had to ask which dishes were dairy free. There was no pro-activity to actually provide any level of service.Upon returning from speaking to the Chef and discussing what to order I was informed that pretty much the entire menu was pre-prepared - 3 items were explained to me to be dairy free. I ordered something and asked pine nuts to be added. Would you believe that I was told that something as simple as pine nuts could not be added to a dish as the sauces were all pre-prepared. Sadly what looks like a decent restaurant was nothing more than place with a man in the kitchen warming up dishes for those visiting. Finally the waitress (possibly in an attempt to impress us) took our order down mentally without writing the order down. I was horrified when the dish I had ordered arrived and found it to be wrong - seafood instead of the aglio olio - we had waited a pretty substantial amount of time waiting for dishes to be heated up as it was. Instead of apologising she had the audacity to imply I had ordered a seafood dish (when I hate seafood) and clearly had said aglio olio.My patience had worn out by this point and I simply walked out. We paid for what had been delivered correctly. When I asked whether the service charge was mandatory she said yes and made no attempt to even offer to discount the food to avoid me having to pay for the absolutely pathetic service.I've travelled a pretty substantial part of the world and this has to be the worse place I have ever visited and by far the worse service I have received.Simply put avoid this place at all costs. If you are staying at the W (or even if not) you are better off ordering room service or eating elsewhere
1
My family and I have been to this restaurant 3 times before and every time we get very disappointed. The only reason why we came back this third (and last) time is because I am Italian and my family loves Italian food.The portions are very small, food is absolutely overpriced and the service is simply appalling - they are not understaffed, simply extremely disorganized, not attentive and confused as the level of English of some waiters is just not good enough.Even tonight, we received the first 2 pizzas after 25 minutes we ordered, then 1 more pizza after 10 minutes and the last one after 10 more minutes - by the time I started eating, my kids were done. Just bad service and coordination as mentioned. We hoped that the first 2 times we were just unlucky, but now we can say that this is unfortunately not the case.Prices are also high, even more so given the small portions.We will never come back
2
Wish I'd seen the reviews before eating here. Would never have eaten at a restaurant that is 4909 out of 7800 in Singapore. However, it was so expensive for very small portions. The portion size of my husbands spaghetti was particularly challenging. On mentioning this to the waiter, it took him 20 minutes to return and tell us that we had our 90 grams of pasta and basically .. Tough ! The size of the portion is company policy. No apologies. Terrible terrible terrible ..... If you are hungry don't even think of eating here as you will be starving
5
The restuarant has good seating out side & inside.We were seated outside with a view of the sea & luxury yatchs parked.The food was amazing & we enjoyed couple of beers & red wines.A must visit for tourist, this is located near the W hotel
5
Nice atmosphere on the marina. The chef is to be complimented; very high quality food. The calamari were something special; very fresh and expertly fried. Spaghetti aglio I olio very good. Great find
1
I had the worst Lasagna Bolognese ever in my life. Not to mention the 30-min wait. The lasagna was charred, dry and the layers of noodle hard. I literally struggled to finish it because going hungry at Sentosa Cove isn't a good idea. Foods from the other restaurants here are all so pricey. It was definitely not worth the S$27.90 I paid for. My wife's Spaghetto Aglio Olio didn't fare any better. The noodle was also hard. At S$22.90, all she got was a plate-full of spaghetti noodle, not even a little piece of meat of any kind.The restaurant gave me the impression of high quality food. But it turned out deeply disappointing
3
Dinner at 9.45pm and there was no crowd on a Thursday night. Typically when there is no crowd, the service goes to sleep, waiting for closing. Had the eponymous pizza, with the sausage being the let-down on what is a good base. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana, and it was like a puff pastry souffle with small slices of eggplant inside. Not special
5
Back to the hotel for a quick change and down to the quay. 30 seconds out the door of the W and there it is. A very family friendly restaurant. Excellent appetizers. Calamari/Caesar were very good. Chicken skewers and pizzas - top quality. And the service was friendly, not overdone, yet attentive.
5
This is a late review coz we visited this resto with my friends on May. Sole Pomodoro is strategically located in quayside isle just near W Hotel so it is very convenient for us that time staying in that hotel. We all love pizza and pasta and we appreciate that this restaurant serves it fresh. I would like to commend though the crew named Symer for it was very busy during that time and he is the only one smiling. He attended to all our needs and even if he is running back and forth he still manages to pass by our table and check if we like the food. I am also a restaurant owner before and this kind of employee is surely worth keeping... Thumbs up to Sole Pomodoro!

We stopped in here for Pizza as my daughter had enough of the local food. I gave in and have to admit this was a great choice. The ambiance was fantastic sitting out on the patio with spectacular marina views. To start with we had the bruschetta and it was cool and yummy, temperature was very hot that day. We then had the Calamari and it was a bit subpar so I would probably leave this off. We finished off with the Pizza Margherita and it was a perfect ending. One of the best pizza's I had. We had a few glasses of wine and lunch was over S$100 (for 3 people) which was a bit pricey but no regrets
1
First time visited sentosa cove. Planning to have a lunch on a weekend. There's a whole stretch of food and beverage establishment along the harbour.After walk through the harbour, we decide to have Italian food. It was warm sunny day the indoor of the restaurant doesn't help to cool me down. Ordered a lagsane and an alio olio. We do expect much from the Italian reataurant.Food served after 10 minutes. Presentation was so so. Lagsane was ok. Alio olio was disappointed. It was too oily and tasteless. The speghetti is very soft at the outer layer but quite hard in the inner layer. I don't think that's al dente. Is just speghetti and a lot of olive oil with some garlic that cost more than $25 a plate. Which is ridiculous.
3
As we live so close to this restaurant I wish I could say it was awesome. But it's average to good. Service is always hit and miss, pizza's are good though. Some of the pasta dishes are ok, beer selection is poor (only 2 to choose from). Due to the proximity will always go there and the location overlooking the marina is hard to beat. Service just needs some work
1
We were 4 of us, 2 adults, 2 childrenWe ordered 2 entrees, 2 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes.The entrees (Bruschetta and Mozarella caprese) were good, only the portions on the small sideThen came the pizzas.. very average.. in particular the grilled vegetables on one of the pizza were not really "grilled", more like "unfrozen" .. but then, we had to wait 25 minutes more for the 2 pasta dishes ..We were supposed to eat together, not one after the other.All said, never again
4
We had dinner with another couple and our dog a couple of weeks ago at this Trattoria in Sentosa. The location is lovely at the corner of the pier and the restaurant is spacious. It's a Trattoria and does not pretend to be otherwise. The food is hearty and filling. The Pizza was reasonably good, as was the lasagna. The staff were very friendly and welcoming to us and our dog. We stayed back for a bottle of wine with cigar afterwards and had a lovely evening overall. We shall definitely be back
4
right next to the W Sentosa at Quayside Isle, great ambience, pizzas good, pasta (had ravioli) was very small but that was what I was hoping for, it was okay but have had better.
4
What a great day after spending the afternoon at a private club to them go and have a great pizza at this place served by lovely people with great friends. I will be back. The Diavolo is marvellous!!!!!
4
We ate here a couple of times whilst staying at the W hotel next door. The food was good quality. We had calamari, antipasti and pizza. Good wine. Friendly service. Not cheap but that seems to be a Singapore trend!
1
too salty, tomato canned soup used as a sauce base. Worst meal I think I have ever had...it seems they use a microwave for everything. Garlic bread had no garlic and was dry...avoid like the plague!!
4
Had dinner there while staying at W Sentosa over the recent long weekend and it was lucky we were there early as it got pretty crowded thereafter. We selected this place amongst the long stretcg of restaurants there as it was the only one that had pizza for the kids.I had the seafood pasta which was surprisingly good but my hubbys vegetable aglio olio was sadly rather plain. The kids cheese pizza was surprisingly good too! Was worried that they couldnt finish it but they liked it so much they finished one pizza each and it's 8-inch. The only thing was that there was no proper entrance as it has an open concept so people were walking in all over the place and seating themselves which made it rather confusing for the staff. We were also confused as to where we could wait to be seated. Being a busy night, the staff appeared hassled and it was difficuly to get their attention at times but its ok, we were in no hurry either.
4
First time to Sentosa cove and we chose to dine in this restaurant because of the pizza and pastas. Food was great and service staffs were nice. I am surprised by the previous review. We had the seafood spaghetti, sole pomodoro pizza, Calamari and the special pizzA of the day As recommended by the staff. Most Importantly mother was happy :
2
Had a similar experience to some of the other reviewers -- walked by at around 8pm, only one other table of diners, was ignored by the staff for some 5 minutes. I am normally quite impatient & would have given up and moved on but my kids wanted pasta and pizza so eventually I just took a table. The food was pretty average, although by this stage the order was only for spaghetti bolognaise and margarita pizza so not easy to judge. Despite this simple order it took forever and then no one was interested in bringing the bill or checking how we were. Eventually I told my children to go and find the waiter and tell him I was leaving. He sauntered over & I still had to walk over to the desk to enter my PIN and then eventually take my card out of the machine & leave without a receipt as had been abandoned once again.Crazy crazy crazy stuff!!! The staff must be revolting
2
I came here last Monday for dinner, and had planned a great dinner experience. Not usually compelled to write a review, but this dinner experience was so bad, people need to be warned before they decide to come. It's not worth taking the troublesome trip into sentosa!First, we had trouble getting the attention of staff to get seated (it wasn't even crowded), and had to wait unnaturally long, almost like they were deliberately avoiding eye contact. Later, when I asked to change the pasta type, the lady serving us told me high-handedly that the Pasta type was specifically chosen for that dish (I always change my pasta type and I have never heard this pasta theory). For the price, the food was way below average (both the pasta and the pizza). And they forgot our pizza, but attempted to make it up by giving us a discount. The only thing I'd give this place is it's ambience and you can give sentosa cove credit for that
3
We went over for lunch while having a staycation in Sentosa. We ordered some calamari which wasn't alot but not too bad. The lasanage was nice but we were very full.. The pizza we ordered was very delicious. We ordered the Sole Pomodoro and it was great to share for 2. Overall, good food with mid pricing. I guess that's what u get for dining by Sentosa cove?
3
We had dinner while staying at the W. Place was fully bookef, so we ended up with reservations at the bar. Antipasti and mixed salad were not bad but bland, so was my wife's pizza margherita. My penne were ok though unremarkable. So were the Shiraz and Chianti we ordered. A busy place in a good location, but it is about all there is to it
4
Good Italian food in a restaurant directly on the bay. Nice place to have dinner. Also try out the gelato shop just next to it.
4
The location was fantastic and near to W sentosa cove. We had seafood pizza, calamari etc. It was really delicious and fresh. My family really enjoyed it. Kudos!!
3
A walk along the quayside opposite the W Singapore Sentosa Cove brought us to Quayside Isle and this row of restaurants serving a range of cuisine from Italian, Greek, Mediterranean, Chinese, etc.This restaurant sits at the beginning of this row of outlets. The open-concept is inviting and the entrances are at the side and front. Nevertheless, we asked for a table of two and picked; and were given a table we liked. Outdoor and indoor seatings were available. The walls of the restaurant were filled with photos. A chalk board displayed the 'Special of the Day'. As soon as we sat down, our water tumblers were turned over (they were turned the other way round for cleanliness). When the menu was presented, we were made known items that were unavailable that day. Well done!The menu was comprehensive and well-categorized. I did notice a spelling error in the menu (mocktails were spelled as moctails). We ordered the Margherita Pizza, Penne Pesto and Spaghetti Arrabbiata. The portions were a trite small if you compared size to price, but I guess that would be acceptable for a Quayside Isle restaurant. Service was acceptable but not fantastic, but let the sights of the yachts do the talking.
1
Meat came undercooked. Staff said will reheat. Excuse me? Is this McDonald's? I overheard the staff telling the other table this is an italian restaurant, we serve al dente. Even McDonald's gives u a freshly made burger. Like the other reviewers said, stay away. Place is flooded with rude pinoys, almost mistook for pinoy restaurant and ordered a balut.
3
Reached W hotel sentosa cove at 1pm, hungry looking for food. Sole pomodoro is just outside of the hotel (there is a very nice stretch of restaurants - quay of isle). Sole pomodoro looked the most presentable and it served Italian cuisine, so we gave it a try.Ordered the bruschetta for starters (after all "tomatoes" is in the name of the restaurant) - the tomatoes were really good and sweet, sgd11 for one big piece.We also ordered the peppered mussels bouillabaisse, which served a generous portion of fresh mussels but the soup was too salty.For mains, we had porcini mushroom risotto and prosciutto pizza. The risotto was good, buttery and flavourful. But the pizza was just average. Overall, the experience was just average and we paid sgd100!
4
I was thrilled to come to this part of Singapore because I've always wanted to visit the new area where the W Hotel is located. The area is luxurious and pleasantly soothing. Anyway, the restaurant doesn't struck me as anything fantastic because there were not many tables occupied (weekday night). Apparently on weekends, this place is packed and reservations has to be made in advance! We sat outdoors facing the marina. Directly opposite the restaurant is the One Degree 15 Hotel. Anyway, we ordered 2 mains and 2 soups and to my surprise, the portion of the soup is rather big! It looks like a main meal to me. The waitress who attended to us couldn't believe her eyes as well. She's really friendly and very attentive to our needs and she her recommendation on desserts is spot on! Soup : Minestrone soup; nothing can possibly go wrong unless your vegetables are not fresh, so, nothing fantastic but I was surprised with the huge portion.Main meals : The pizza is nothing much to shout about. The pasta definitely taste better than the pizza and if I have my way, I would have my spaghetti cooked another 2-3 minutes longer; I prefer my spaghetti to be well done. Desserts : U have to try their home-made gelato because apparently they are a MUST TRY! Yes, I do agree on this and we tried. I tasted the pistachio one while my friend had the chocolate one. The Pistachio is extremely yummy. Chocolate could never go wrong. If I have more room in the stomach, I would have tried the original flavoured one. Darn

My wife and I visited for dinner after 8pm on a Saturday night. We had to search for someone to ask if there was a table available and the welcome was hardly friendly. The waitresses were all running around like headless chickens and demonstrated no enthusiasm or enjoyment in their work which detracted from the experience. I ordered beef ravioli which came as a small serving of small pieces around one inch square, very little beef to be found and poor value at $27. My wife had the chicken skewers and fries which were average but hardly value for money. Won't be rushing back. The place could do with a decent manager who can organise the staff, inject some enthusiasm and a create an atmosphere that makes the customer feel welcome
5
On our second visit here we just had dessert. But really my most favorite in their menu is the burrata salad. It is the best i've ever had and on our 3rd visit i am really excited to have it. And it is still as good as before.The Penne Arrabbiata is very nice as well
1
Family of 5 came here to dine during weekends. Ordered fries for the kid, one calamari as starter, 2 pizzas for the adult and one spagetti. Firstly, the fries for the kid is oily and soggy. The calamari is nothing but flour, and the pizzas is worst then pizza hut. My mum had the spagetti and it was like instant noddles with cream. When I feedback to the restaurant manager who is a pinoy ( in fact the servers and cooks are all pinoys!), she insisted it was al dante! Really poor quality and service. If you have money and no where to spend, feel free to try here

If you feel like a light meal & a few beverages away from your hotel then give this excellent trattoria a go. Wood fired oven, pasta, calamari fritti & an extensive cellar contributed to a great night. Not to mention the fabulous location on the edge of the marina

I quite like the food here. In particular, the pizzas are tasty. Expensive but good quality. Very nice setting and great service. They always try their best to find you a seat when it's busy and you haven't booked.

My wife and I brought our kids here for lunch. We shared a pizza, the parma ham with melon, fried calamari, and a carbonara pasta. The crudo e rucola pizza was made before our eyes and popped into a fire oven. I enjoyed the “crudo”, which was generously topped with parma ham. The tomato base wasn’t too overpowering. My favourite of the meal. My wife preferred the carbonara pasta which was rich and also good. My son liked the calamari and polished most of it off. Plus point being that they provided kid friendly plastic utensils, plates and cups for the little ones. They also provide a kids menu. The waiter also brought out a high chair for our youngest one without prompt and immediately removed the metal utensils. Very pleased at how proactive the staff are

We overall very much liked the time at this restaurant, as we spend a relaxed time with some friends (incl small kids playing around) at the outdoor seating area. The view is cool, if you like seeing small to medium sized yachts. The food is average, certainly good enough if your focus is on spending time with friends. The staff is friendly and quick

This is the first in the parade of restaurants opposite the W in Sentosa Cove, it is the last in quality and service.The food was very poor I had a whole sea bass which tasted awful and with it came the soggiest sorriest bowl of chips I have ever seen I think they were a least a week old I ate two.My wife had the vongole which she pronounced dreadful.That is really all there is to say, just avoid this and head on down the parade to the other great spots

Decided to visit the exclusive Sentosa Cove to celebrate a friend's graduation and we kept walking along Quayside Isle till I noticed the bright and welcoming Sole Pomodoro. I remembered reading about their wood-fired oven. And the staff confirmed this!We went in and ordered 2 pizzas to share among the 3 of us. The portion was huge! (although the waitress told me this is the standard 10" pizza) We had a Capricciosa which had the lovely, stringy mozzarella and fresh mushrooms with ham and salami. I'm not a fan of artichoke so I picked mine out. The crust was thin and blackened slightly, really good flavour. Toppings were adequate too.We also ordered a Solepomodoro (named after the restaurant?) which had mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, ham and onions but also, interestingly, potatoes and cream! That was the first time I had a non-tomato base pizza. It was yummy :) As we left I saw the table next to ours having some pasta. I will be back for some for sure
3
I have just had dinner with guests at Sole Pomodoro on Sentosa where I live. Sat at the end of the bar where 2 Italian guys who I presume are the owners by the way they were speaking to the staff. IF YOU READ THIS you are the tall bald headed one strutting around the restuarant and walking backwards & forwards behind the pizza counter. 1) You were wearing outdoor clothes & flip flops. 2) You never once washed your hands once but continued to handle food3) You picked up a piece of chicken that I presume is used on the pizzas, broke a piece off and threw the main piece back onto the counter whilst chewing on the other bit.At this point you STILL hadn't washed your hands when entering a food prep area!Whether owner, chef, waitress or pot washer the same rules should apply to everyone when in food prep areas......... Yes I am speaking from experience. Not impressed at all

We went to Sole Pomodoro last week with friends who were visiting Singapore for the first time. Sentosa Cove is so lovely that we thought this would be the place to wow them some more. We picked this restaurant because it's pretty difficult to screw up Italian food but boy, were we wrong! The tomato topping on the pizza was some funny orange colour and the cheese which should have been melted on nicely was still in a lump. Everything looked like it was dumped on in a hurry and it was so salty it was inedible. We ordered a mozzarella salad and twenty minutes after we placed our orders, we were told there was no more mozzarella. Why didn't they tell us this right away? So we ordered something else. Needless the say the starter arrived way after the mains. The pasta was limp and the ingredients not fresh. We were so annoyed that we complained to the staff. Their response was that they were extremely busy! HELLO .... you're in the restaurant business, you should be geared up for this!To be fair to them, we said we would not pay for the poor food and they charged us only for the wine and water. I can only surmise from past reviews that they must have two chefs because we got the bad one that day
1
This restaurant has decent food, amazing location but sadly the MOST rude, inconsiderate staff I. Btw, upon writing to the owner Mr.Corrado Riccio....the response was not very positive and wanted to defend their staff suggesting that "on weekends the place gets too busy" ...... guys, that is the time your customers are dining and expect service + value for their money. Right ?.....so if you expect service, this is NOT the place to be

I have eaten in a lot of restaurant all over the world, i enjoyed this one very much. Though a bit expensive i thought. Enjoyed the food, wine and company, the view was at night so not much to see.If im in Sentosa again ill go back, loved the Pizza

We stayed at W Hotel and we had our dinner here. It was a lovely salad, burrata cheese is my favorite. It is a big serving, good for sharing. We orderd pizza margherita with salami but the chef forgot to put the basil leaves. When we asked for it he just bring us the basil leaves on a small saucer
3
It was a nice meal. Great and relaxing ambiance. Pizza was really good. Didn't take that long. Unfortunately, it's not a fabulous restaurant but nice place to grab a pizza on a relaxing day. Will I go back? Yes.

Tried this restaurant during one of Singapore trips. We stayed at W Sentosa which is near this restaurant. We decided to try and in my opinion their food are good and prompt friendly service as well. One of the best Italian at Sentosa.

Nice views to harbour. You can sit inside or outside terrace. They serve reasonably priced tasty authentic Italian pastas. wood oven pizzas etc. If you are staying for example in Resorts World, you had to take free bus to here
3
The spaggetti is well received but the pizza toppings were kind of stingy and felt like someone just pelted it with what ever they had left. The dough was very well kneaded but could do better with more toppings

This restaurant does not deserve to be in business. We waited at least 20 minutes for someone to serve us after being seated. No one did, so we had to physically approach a waiter to ask for service. We placed an order for a bottle of wine and a starter. The starter arrived within minutes, but the wine did not arrive. 20 minutes later still no sight of our waiter, so we walked up to another waitress to ask her to check. She said they were getting it from the cellar. Really?About 10 minutes later I spotted our waiter and again walked up to him to ask where the wine was. He said he would check, and then came to tell us they didn't have the wine in stock. I asked him to wait at the table while I ordered another bottle. I was fuming. He then switched us to another waiter who it seems should have been looking after us all the time as we were seated in his section. Perhaps nobody told him he had a new table? After that the service was fine. The food however was abysmal. The buffallo mozzarella salad came with a few cherry tomato halves and a smidgeon of pesto. The cheese itself was good, but it was not really a salad, just a ball of cheese. The grilled prawns were served with a choice of sides, so I ordered salad. The prawns were served without any sauce - just dry prawns on a bed of steamed brocolli. They were distinctly fishy and I couldn't eat them. The salad was nothing but a pile of dry lettuce leaves. No dressing, no other ingredients. My husband's pasta was undercooked.The ambience is terrible. Club-style music playing inside the restaurant, kids making a noise everywhere. Painful to sit there. And then the bill. Over $220 for a bad meal and average bottle of wine. On top of that, at first the bill was wrong - we were charged for the wine that was not in stock. They could not void it on our credit card so had to give us the cash back. I should have read tripadvisor before going here. Never again

Went with a family of six with a 3 year old child. Took them more than 60 mins to bring the child's meal, which did not come until after all the adults had finished their meal. Additional drinks ordered was slammed on the table as though this was the worst task asked for.

Attracted to this restaurant by the sight of the wood fired oven. Pizzas are priced at about $24 each for a 12-inch pizza. My partner and I shared a meat and seafood pizza, calamari fritti ($15) and were quite full. The complimentary olive bread served at the start of the meal was very tasty. Heineken pints at $10 is good value. Service is prompt and perfunctory. No complaints. the restaurant is located within a short walk of Little India MRT station. It's a pleasant place for a quick meal if you're in the vicinity shopping at Sim Lim Square

Ordered a Campari to start as an aperitive; lady did not know what it was then asked me to point it our from menu ! What I got was a very small glass (half size from d one on d table) with a very light pink water no taste of Campari whatsoever so she did not know how to measure! For 13 dollars? It was not worth to stay for lunch and elsewhere to eat!

had the best pizza here ever, with the best seat in quayside aisle! I usually go for pasta in an Italian ristorante but having seeing the woodfired oven and the chef at work, I thought I should give it a try. Glad I did :) best pizza crust
3
Have eaten at Cuginis and the city Sole Pomodoro before, and both were really good.The Sentosa experience left a little to be desired. The whole Quayside area is taking time to grow, but it was quiet so not very lively. Others may enjoy the peace.Some pizza was good, another was undercooked and came with wrong ingredients the first time around. Calamari was over-cooked.Wait staff were very nice though and tried their best to be helpful and attentive.Definitely willing to give it another shot, but its not cheap and quite far away
1
Extremely pricey restaurant, that offers at best average food. Also, portions are far from generous. You eat just next to a busy road. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing (Food, Location, Service, etc) which would justify these prices. Hence, pls avoid this place.

Feel ripped off. Got a plain looking dul pizza. Not impressed. I can make better pizzas in my oven. If you made that pizza in Itay they would cry
3
I've tried this place a couple of times. The menu isnt that inspiring and most of the dishes you could whip up at home. Quality is good though.Location is also good sitting on the marina . Service ok.In summary cant really get excited about it . Actually struggling to write this review
1
A french cut lamb chop priced at sgd47.50 served in 3 pathetic slices with only mash potatoes as side dish in a non existence presentation. The lamb slices were burnt, salty and so thinly sliced you would be wondering where there rest of the portion is. I was shocked with the meat portion vs the pricing I am paying. Risotto is pricey at sgd 34.90 and does not look appetising at all.Service was terrible poor with staff putting on a sulky face.A place to AVOID because it is ABSOLUTELY not worth the money
4
Overall a good experience. The place is bright and cheerful. The pasta we had was tasty and of decent amount. Dessert was a bit of a let down. The chocolate soufflé, while good, was accompanied by ice-cream which was unfortunately not of good quality. Service was just okay.

I read a blog extolling the deliciousness and authenticity of Sole Pomodoro's pizzas, so was very keen to try it out. We went to visit the Sole Pomodoro on Mackenzie Road (opposite Rex Cinemas). My family are very keen to check out new Italian places, so we were quite excited. What a disappointment! The restaurant is located in an old 'shophouse' on Mackenzie Road. There were already complaints that it is too hot in Singapore to sit in this stuffy restaurant (windows, doors, all open but you're indoors so it gets very stuffy. They have air-con that barely works and of course, all the cool air goes straight out due to everything being open). The pizzas were unpalatable, lacking in texture, flavour and visually, was a mess. So much for the so-called wood fire oven! The caesar salad was drenched in caesar dressing, and the seafood pasta sauce tasted like it came straight from a store-bought bottle (perhaps even worse). The pasta was overcooked - way beyond al dente. We had plenty of leftovers and had a disagreement as to whether we should take it home because it was that terrible (I hate wasting food, even bad food). The next shock was the bill - it was hugely overpriced - for 3 people, it was over SGD$120. We decided if we're going to spend that money, we're better off going back to the family favourite Italian restaurant (Lafiandra) in Bras Basah, and vowed never to return to Sole Pomodoro
1
Location is great, decor is ok. But the food is tasteless despite a wood-fired oven for pizzas. Service is mega-slow and inefficient. Food and drinks are way overpriced. And the bill was wrong (prices on the bill were very different from prices on the menu - higher of course). In short: avoid.

A pretty setting such as Quayside Isle, one would think the landlord would be more selective with its tenants. The service was mediocre, but the food was just horrid. We ordered from the kid's menu, the meatballs ($9.90 I believe) and a pasta with tomato sauce ($13.90?), and for us adults we had a seafood pasta and a capricciosa pizza. The meatballs arrived and we wondered how the serving of three miserable meatballs was considered a main course for any kid. The pasta was only enough to fill 1/4 of my son's 8-year-old tummy. So we weren't surprised when the seafood pasta arrived - the plating was terrible, and we could easily make out two miniature mussels, one small prawn, two morsels of fish and a handful of anorexic clams. The pizza was nothing to shout about. The fried calamari was ok too. The four "mains", starter and a beer came out to about $130. The food cost was probably $1

Living on Sentosa we have been very happy to learn that along with a couple of good restaurants a sibling of one of our favorites club street restaurants "the Cugini" also opened in our new preferred dining strip on the Quay side. However, we unfortunately had to endure the worst dining experience here ever, which ended with a 100 SGD bill for nearly nothing (because of the serving) and also nearly untouched (because of the taste) food and another dinner in one of the other restaurants. To start, please note that already a few weeks ago, we went with another coupler to this place for some pizza, which compared to the competitor on the quay side was quite tasteless, if it was not for the burned crust. The cheese seemed to be from a cheap supermarket and the salami was hard to find. Loving the Cugini, we thought that maybe the pasta is worth another try. Unfortunately it just got worse. We started with a burrata salad (33 SGD ++) which should have been enough for two to share. However, with pure shock, we have been receiving and OK portion of burrata cheese, loveless placed in the middle of a nearly empty plate, decorated by not more than 3 half tomato slices and maybe also 5 leaves of rocket salad. No Bread! We have seen this already so much better and would have not expected that you can get it that bad anywhere. Ok, if you ask for bread you’ll get it and with some of the good olive oil and the Aceto Balsamico they have on their tables, it finally was Ok but remained overprized. Our pasta arrived while we were still enjoying some bread and olive oil, which was no reason for the service not to take away our plates away !While eating! Now coming to the saddest moment of the evening, the pasta. We had “Raviolo Ricotta e spinaci” and some penne with ragout sauce. The penne have been OK, if you would be eating in a canteen, taste and presentation was similar to the presentation in our office canteen (and I prefer the hawker). However, it is still an unsolved mystery where the very strong fish taste on the 5 ravioli we got for 25.50 SGD was coming from. The waitress meant that there might be some fish sauce in the “freshly chopped tomato sauce”. Why? Outcome was that for the first time in our life, we didn’t finish our food although we have been very hungry. I hope this review is helping rather the Management to improve the standard very quickly or you folks to just enjoy one of the better restaurants around the Quay side. So far all others are worth a vsit depending on the occasion and the budget you want to spend

we have been a few times to Sole over past 3 months...but with every visit our enthusiasms has been vanishing. they have a great location on Quayside Isle with a relaxing view on marina and nice interior design toping the ambience impression. I like their ravioli (both versions) and risotto is also good. Pizza is decent but there is a better one in a nearby Picotin restaurant. Now, over time their service has been getting on my nerve. they treat you like a necessary evil. zero smile or warm welcome despite us visiting this place few times. also looks like some of their kids menu item was not too fresh last time as our kid felt bad after the visit. net, off my list for a while. if you find this review useful I appreciate you letting me know. also check my other reviews

Excellent ambience (smoker friendly, though hardly anyone smokes in Singapore). Really good food, Italian-worthy espresso. The white chocolate pannacotta was good, though very rich after a heavy meal. Wouldn't have minded sharing mine. Not the cheapest place, not for the ubertightfisted.

I actually live on sentosa cove, and it is by far the worst restaurant on the island. Food is never served on time and the service is as bad as it can get. The owners are rude and the staff are not trained. Do not go to her

Unusually located in Little India accross from the old REX Cinema on Mackenzie Rd and Niven Rd, where you can find a real brick oven pizza. Calamari fritti is utterly mouthwatering $14.90. We had Pizza Capricciosa and Diavola ( not sure if that Asian green chilli really goes with the pizza for Diavola effect ) for $24.90 each. A glass of vino $8. a pint of Heineken $ 10.There are more choices of pasta and dessert. Our pizza dinner costs $ 115 for three. Service is average- although I personally feel they are too fast and too eager in asking if we wanted another glass.Bear in mind the pizzeria is not airconditioned. There are tables on the walkway close to road partially covered by slanting roof and indoor with many fans that we did not feel warm. The lighting is somewhat on the dim side. All in all it is a good alfresco dining for a real Italian.We took bus 65 from Orchard and hopped out on Selegie and found taxi easily in front of pizzeria to go home

Great service and good food! .. We had homemade ravioli and seafood spagetti .. Excellent ! and to finish the homemade pistachio ice cream ...possibly the best I have tasted. ... And even better .. Dog friendly .. Water bowls and toy bones to play with ... Nice touch ,Will most certainly return

Family visit of four on a Sunday. The place was busy but not packed. We ordered a mix of pizzas, one pasta and a salad. The pizzas came within 15 minutes and they were good, but we had to send them back for slicing, as they were too hard to cut with the table knives provided. The salad, a caesar, was well presented but totally lacked any flavor, no doubt due to the fact that the dressing, as it turned out basically mayonnaise, was small and served on the side. The pasta almost never arrived. It took an hour, in the meantime, everyone else had finished their dinners more than a half hour before. Several inquiries from the staff were met with white lies like 'just one more minute'. When it did arrive it was ok, nothing special. Juice drinks were very small, not fresh and overpriced.If this place lasts a year I'll be shocked. The Italian owners were scurrying about looking stressed and with dark faces, providing an overall negative vibe to the place. It seemed they were most preoccupied with serving wines, which is no doubt how they make their money. I would recommend to avoid this place unless it really gets its act together

..because suddenly the good flavour of the beef carpaccio, parma ham/melon, calamari and the pan fried veal was lost in the bad taste of service. Dining experience will always be special at Quayside Isle - Sentosa Cove because the whole atmosphere of dining by the marina where superyachts can be seen berthed, is exciting. However let's talk about the service at Sole Pomodoro at Quayside Isle - it left the whole family 'wanting'! In spite of letting the waitress know that being seated in the corner would mean we need a casual look in once in a while, this was not once met. We had a choice of 3 side plate with the main but none of these was offered as choices to my husband ordering the main. When he finally asked for extra mashed potatoes, it was hardly a dollop by the main! The ground pepper never made it to our table, the salt pot was empty, our request to have food packed for take away was not heeded and we had to ask for the dessert menu 3 times - even worse, it never came. We went to Note di Sicilia for best icecream 3-doors away. When explained to a gentleman (who popped up to serve us) about our experience, he responded that they were 10 days old and have teething issues (challenged with the 'authorities' for good help) - Why open at the expense of service?? Business vs Sense

We had dinner at this restaurant right in front of the W Sentosa Cove, its right by the pier and the whole ambience is perfect. We didnt know what to expect really, but let me tell you the food was wonderful!! Its one of those places where you can feel the quality of the ingredients. Pizza Capriciosa was perfect, with the ham, the mushrooms and the artichoke plenty and fresh, I had some beef raviolis freshly made and my wife had the frutti di mare which she said it was excellent. For dessert we ordered a white chocolate creme brule which they sadly didnt have so we ordered the chocolate suffle and it was the cherry on the cake!! absolutely amazing! Really recommend this place, good luck in Sentosa

We enjoyed two wonderful pasta dishes, great wine and Tiramisu and Gilato.It may well be the cosiest restaurant on the Quay side, because it has a verypersonal decor, fun furniture and great china with a true touch of Italy.Very nice service, we welcome yet another great restaurant to the neighborhood

I have been coming here regularly for the past years, and I reccomanded it to friends and collegues, especially for pizza and atmosphere. They cook pizza on a real brick oven with wood fire (almost unique in singapore). Unfortunately lately they changed menu, main chef and pizza guy...result they removed or modified some of our favorites and the pizza is almost unedible!! quality became poor but prices stayed same. never, ever again then
