Excellent coffee (espresso, cappucino, latte, etc.) served in a casual setup. I love the neighborhood café atmosphere. The wifi is free and unlimited.

Dogs allowed, which we like. Maube because if the barling they got our coffee order wrong? Took forever to get it too.... The place is clean, even though there are plenty of dogs running around. Apple crumble was very nice.

Brought my baby and dog to lunch at the dog cafe and would definitely come back again! Food was pretty good:)

They have good service staff and good food too! Both for humans & furkids.

We went to have dinner at this so-called pet friendly cafe as I have heard good reviews about it. Upon entering the cafe, I was standing at the entrance waiting for 10mins before someone showed me to an empty table. The cafe was only 3 tables filled. After ordering our food, it took us close to 20mins before our drinks were served, and another 15mins before our food were served. 2 of the other tables had already finished their meal, and only one table with a couple already had their food served.Although it claimed to be a dog friendly cafe, but all the dogs have to be leashed and tied to their owners chairs. The dogs cannot roam freely in the cafe. I didn't know I have to leashed my dog, thus I forgot to bring my dog's leash. The waitress just told me to keep my dog by my side and not let it roam around. Then how is this a pet friendly cafe if the pets are not allowed to roam freely?! I was shocked as I have went to a few pet cafes and the pets were allowed to roam and mingle freely without being leashed to their owners' chairs.I will not go back there again as it doesn't allow my pet to roam and mingle freely. Disappointed

The entire cafe was very clean despite the presence of many dogs running around. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and customers also do their part to clean up after their own dogs to ensure a nice environment for everyone. My friend and I were not expecting much taste-wise for the food, but we were pleasantly surprised! We ordered the Prawn Aglio Olio and Salmon Pesto Pasta and both tasted great. Would love to go back

Been a regular at Sun Ray Cafe and hope to see monthly specials or change in food menu every now and then or else will be eating the same old items again and again. Both the human and dog food are equally delicious and presentable! Always a fun place to be with your little furkids or friends. Keep up the good service and standard of food quality

It's dog friendly which is fine but it's a small, dark and dingy setting which doesn't smell very pleasant. The food was poor and despite ordering coffees 15 minutes before we ordered breakfast, we had all finished eating by the time two drinks were finally brought over. Won't be going back - there are much better dog friendly places in the area, which have an outdoor setting

everything i ordered so far tastes awesome!
salad, soup, coffee, omelette, bread...
prices are reasonable as well.

I was there with my team with recommendation from a colleague. The lunch promotion is a great deal. The mushroom soup that we had ordered taste good. I've ordered the risotto and it's was good as well. And the coffee taste great. The price stated is nett price, not tax and services charges.There're two section at the cafe, 1 is the pet section for those with pets and another section without pets. This is great as some might not feel conformable dinning with pets around and would like to try out their food.I'll be back again especially for their coffee
5
Firstly, the pet section of the cafe is spacious enough for the dogs to roam and play. Secondly, the food and coffee is nice! (As you know, most pet cafes' food are mediocre). I even bought a loaf of freshly baked wholemeal bread. Delicious! I will definitely go back again

Was here with a friend from Msia. Ordered a Wagyu burger, Saffron Risotto and Matcha Tiramisu. Wagyu was nicely done, juicy and pineapple compliment well with rest. Was told that the Risotto was so so. And the match tiramisu dont seems to goes well with us. Parking is a chores as space very limited. Pets friendly and my dog roam around freely. Can have a bottle of beer while your roam around mingle with other dog

Have visited many dog cafes including Hapenstance which some blog commented that it's the best in S'pore. I much prefer Sunray.In my opinion Sunray is still the best. Have been to Sunray many times for the past 2 years, almost once a month. For a dog café, Sunray's food standard is very high. Service is very good too. Have recommended many of my friends to try out this café and their comments so far is very positive

Another great hangout with friends and furkids!Been there a few times, love their food and service staff. Will continue to visit them with our furkids! For those who has furkids and not sure where to meet new friends? Here's the place besides Happenstance Cafe which I like too

Lovely little pet-friendly restaurant that has no airs or graces, just very good food, great coffee, warm homey atmosphere - and your dog will love you. They have a menu for your pets too. From our dog's reaction, the food is most definitely K9A1. Prices are very reasonable doggy dinners are about the same price as a canned meal, but freshly made with fresh ingredients. The dogs roam around freely in the restaurant with an outdoor balcony type area that is also fenced so your pets can wander around while you sit outside rather than inside if you like. There is a separate area if you don't want to dine with the critters. There is out door and indoor seating for that section too so all catered for. Nice way to wander around the neighbourhood, walk your dog and have a dinner or coffee, Lunch, breakfast - whatever - whenever you feel like it. Really nice little place

We have been here couple of times before. Food was good. Especially good with our dog around. Price was very reasonable. Staff friendly. Will definitely be back again

Cosy cafe hidden in the heartland. Furkid friendly. Service was acceptable as they are a little short handed. Very friendly staff and helpful in explaining the menu. Took away a bento set and muffins for my Furkid, he loves it. Our food was fine but I recall our previous visit was served with better (more delicious) food. Guess the kitchen was really busy on christmas! Will return on a casual day next time

Food was good the coffees could use some work. Staff were friendly but not proactive. Overall alright experience would go bac

I do not usually write bad review on a restaurant but the service here is not acceptable for such a small scale restaurant. I visited this place few months ago. What happened was a group of us visited this place for brunch and I ordered Yorkshire pork while the rest of my friends ordered from the brunch menu. After 30mins, my food is still not arrive yet, while all my friends finish eating their food despite constant reminding the staff that there is still 1 food yet to arrice. Moreover, the same thing happened to our beverages (ice lemon tea) that we ordered. It was on the bar for a good 5 mins and my friend decided to take it from the bar instead of getting serve by the staff. After 45 mins. as my food STILL isn't serve. I decided to cancel it off. At the end, I did not even have a bite of anything from the restaurant. Hopefully, you guys can improve after so long, but as a person from the same industry, I could not tolerate this and will likely will not visit here again

Celebrated our dog's birthday at this cafe. We think our dog enjoyed his dinner though he wasn't in the mood for fruits as dessert. The food for humans was yummy, especially the desserts.The cafe has a section for humans & their fur kids and another for humans only.Price was reasonable too

Sunray Cafe is my favourite cafe to visit whenever I bring my dog out. Half of the cafe is dedicated to customers with pets! They have a variety of food there. Different kinds of cuisine. I cant say they serve the best coffee there but it is good enough. The owner is friendly and the staffs are very helpful. They have the best music there too. Will definitely go back

Had a nice dinner here on 7 Aug. I had the duck leg confit with orange sauce and my wife the seafood aglio olio. Finished off with the lava cake with ice cream washed down with a beer. Has a dog friendly area so if you have an aversion to the occassional bark, you might have an issue with this restaurant. Not for me as I love animals in general

It's rare to find pet friendly cafes in Singapore, and this is one of them. The food is also surprisingly good, on par with the most expensive restaurants in Singapore. The owner takes his coffee seriously, which is evident in its quality. Finally, the price provides good value, especially the set meals.Big gripe is parking. There are just a lack of spaces to park. If not for this I would give it 5 stars

This place is interesting, and seems to be known for its' coffee. There was a platter of complimentary chocolates on the table, which delighted the children. Staff were friendly, greeting us as we came in, and chatting with the kids throughout. The cakes (rainbow and chocolate lava) were a hit with the children, although the adults found it too sweet. The coffees went down well, the barista customised an iced chocolate, and the honey lemon was a treat!However, the breakfast platter was bland (consisting of mushrooms, eggs with Hollandaise sauce, and couscous), and the service was patchy. We had to ask for napkins twice (none were provided) and it took 10 minutes after the second request for it to arrive. I was not too impressed.The pet-friendly section was crowded with dogs of all shapes and sizes, and their owners. Lovely ambience

Visited Sun Ray recently for brunch on a weekday. It was quiet as they just opened at 11 am. Great personal service. Knowledge about what they serve. Barista even share her Omakase coffee concoction. The experience is like being with friends. We had Pesto Prawn Linguine, both prawn and pasta was tasty. The vietnamese inspired lemongrass alio olio which is vegetarian is a surprise and yummy. Generouse portions. Go try
