Absolutely my favorite place for family dinners.. Great Szechuan food in a cute, small neighborhood. The food is consistently good, and the mango pudding is top notch. Been going there for years, and always make it a point to visit whenever I am in town.

I re-visited Seletar Hill Restaurant today after my first dining experience there many years back and the restaurant, tucked away in a quiet corner of Singapore near Jalan Kayu, remains frozen in time. As soon as you walk in, you'll feel as if you've been transported back in time to the 60's as you're greeted by the restaurant's traditional decor, furnishings and furniture. It is nevertheless a clean, quaint place that exudes a nice welcoming vibe.The menu is quite extensive with average pricing and food that satisfy the palate. No complaints about our order which were:1. Claypot Seafood Beancurd (small) S$20 with deep fried egg-toufu, fresh scallops, prawns, fish slices.2. Kai-lan with Prawns (small) S$16. Fresh kai-lan that is young and tender. Big prawns.3. Hotplate Ginger Onion Beef (small) S$16. Tender beef slices in very delicious fragrant sauce. 4. Garoupa Fillet in White Wine Sauce (small) S$18. This is something different and not usually available in other Chinese Restaurant. Clear and soothing sauce. Fresh, thick fish slices.5. E-Fu Mee Mushrooms (small) $8Plus their desserts at S$1.90 each were all delicious and value-for-money..Mango Pudding (made from Indian Mango), Durian Pudding (made from D24 durian) and Double-Boiled Snow Fungus (melt-in-your-mouth snow fungus).Service is prompt and attentive. There are only about 10 tables, ranging from those that can seat 4, to the biggest with lazy suzy that can squeeze up to 12 pax. The restaurant opens from 11.30am -2.30pm for lunch and 5.30pm - 10pm for dinner every day except Saturdays when it opens only for dinner. Paid (including Sundays) coupon parking along the road outside the restaurant

This restaurant is tucked away in Seletar Hills and is very much a place families go. We have been many times over the years including for many celebrations. Generally consistent and good food. Signature dishes are good. Braised pork ribs also good. Reasonable prices but you may need to book at busy times if you want a seat inside

This restaurant is about 25 minutes drive from the city and is located in a private residential estate. It was opened more than 20 years ago. There are 4 signature dishes (among others) that you must try - Camphor Tea Smoked Duck, General Tso's Chicken, Tung Po Pork and the Dry-sautÃ©ed Stringbeans. In addition, the Lemon Chicken is tender and worth trying. If you like desserts, go for the Double-boiled Snow Fungus or the D24 Durian Pudding.Staff is helpful and courteous and service is unhurried.
