Restuarant is in Paragon Orchard. Nice location. Staff are helpful, food is great! Good place to have an upscale chinese food.
5
Came here for dim sum with friends along with kids. Food was excellent especially the scallop dumplings and the xiao long bao which we thought was much better than din tai fung and paradise. Service was excellent and responsive
4
This restaurant is one my favorite because of their home cooking style of Teochew cuisine. I prefer Teochew food over the Cantonese because it is less oily and heavy. Service standard is high and attentive.
1
Terrible service and not quality not worth the prices. The staff didn’t understand English and the food was not that great. Would not recommend it at all
4
revisited the restaurant after two years, and i daresay the quality of food and service has improved alot due to the fact they won the michelin star. prices were reasonable
5
Came here a few days ago to celebrate my mom’s birthday. The few dishes that we ordered were all very well done. Even my mom, who’s a picky eater commented that the food is very good! Will definitely come back again!
4
As usual, the food and service at Crystal Jade Golden Palace is excellent. It is always crowded and well patronised, so reservations are necessary.
3
The food was good except the pork which had a bad smell. The service was Ok just that it took ages to order. But overall was ok and will go again next time.
3
Design and ambiance of the place is good. Food is slightly above average. All the food is not bad but nothing worth mentioning.The service is good however they do not provide WIFI for customers even though they have network.Price is on the steep side but is expected due to the nature of its location
4
This is an illustration of how clueless (or ‘financially motivated’) Michelin inspectors are when it comes to rating Asian restaurants. Golden Palace is the most high-end restaurant in the Crystal Jade group, and that’s probably why it received one Michelin star. The décor is sober and elegant; the food is very good without being superb; while competent, service has lapses and is not as personal as at the Imperial Treasure outlets. There are many unstarred Chinese restaurants in Singapore which are as good as CJ Golden Palace
4
Food was excellent, service wasn’t the best. I was expecting more up-market service but it really was not excellent. The food however, was very good!
5
Excellent food and ambience. My guests were impressed that we had a private room but that comes with a minimum spending which they were not aware of. However, they enjoyed the food and the wine we ordered.
5
the food,service,atmosphere are all top class. highly recommend eating family style/ luckily we had a food expert ordering!!!
5
Great service and delicious food.i would highly recommend this place. We ordered chun fun, a bbq pork dish and other little plates.
5
It was just the two of us catching up together. We wanted to try what we want to eat but a little too much too order. We have good recommendations and sincere service. Cannot wait to be back to try more.
5
Elegant restaurant with fine food certainly worthy of its 1 Michelin star. The suckling pig was magnificent.
4
The Beijing duck was great in every way. The roasted chicken dish was a let down compared to the one I had at PU TIEN. Felt like it was kinda overrated due to it being a fine dining Chinese place. The food was okay and I might dine there again. But it definitely is not on my MUST dine list.
3
Table for 2 walking . We didn’t know this restaurant had 1 Michelin star when we came in, so we were a bit skeptical at the beginning we didn’t want to had a dining experience , just eat . We were surprise with the reasonable prices and items on the menu . High quality products and nice combination compare to other Chinese restaurants . So we sat down .We order the typical crispy pork , double boiled chicken soup, Dumplings , we try the scallops and the abalone, we didn’t enjoy the taste and texture What really disappoint was the tasteless, blend and warm fried rice . We inform the supervisor that we didn’t like it at all ; and the answer was “ everybody like it “ . In the end we pay for all . Some of the service staff were very good just one person decision, can ruin any experience and make the guest to don’t go back again ( just saying ... )
4
Elegant, with well trained staff who look after all your dining needs. They have nice spacious private rooms. The menu is extensive and interesting. We enjoyed their Roast Goose meat, braised goose web with mustard green , and the fried dried sharks fin was amazing!! Their Poached Soon hock fish with Bean Paste and radish was delicious. The stewed mee Pok with eggplant in XO sauce was disappointing. The taro with ginkgo nut dessert was a tad bit too sweet
5
Want a good Chinese food heading to Crystal Jade singapore , we very happy with the service , food was delicious, the restaurant is clean , friendly & fun service nice ambient high ceiling great view too We enjoy the food so so much Highly recommended
4
My family goes regularly to Crystal Jade Golden Palace. The food is always very good. Service is also good.
5
Came here for lunch with a friend. Pleasantly surprised to be given the small private room which can sit four people. We ordered some dim sum and a few dishes. Quality of food is excellent!
5
My wife and I had a great time here. The Peking duck was amazing and the service was perfect. Price was within expectations. We totally recommend here.
5
Great chinese restaurant in a mall on Orchard road. Very cozy ambience, we had a great evening. Excellent peking duck, but not only. Good service
5
we were there with our beijing friends. they were impressed with the food & ambience. a great venue for entertainment
5
It was a Michelin 1 Star restaurant so all 18 of us (mostly from US; also Friend from Japan, Korea & Taiwan) were full of expectations.
It didn’t disappoint us - both food & ambience. Service was great but not outstanding. Thank you.
5
This is probably the best branch of the Crystal Jade group and the only one with a Michelin star. It specialises in Teochew dishes such as cold crab, pomfret porridge. Cantonese dishes served here like dim sum and barbecued meats and assorted seafood dishes are superb too
4
The Crystal Jade outlet is truly "the jewel of the crown", based on our experience and visits to the restaurant.There was a wide selection of yummy appetizing dim-sum and other Cantonese fare. We ordered our favourites: scallop dumpling, seafood pancake, deep-fried yam-balls, beef-balls, lotus-leaf glutinous rice, egg-white-crabmeat seafood dish and yam-paste with gingko nuts dessert. Artistically presented and prepared! Though priced higher than the market.For those who like spicy-hot dips, do ask for the shrimp chilli paste
4
This Michelin 1-Star restaurant serves delicious Cantonese cuisine and Dim Sum at friendly prices. The trifle angel hair pasta and dim sum is my usual buffet order. They also have set menu which is good for business lunches. Service staff are attentive and always ready when u need them. However, do note that they are always full during lunch hour so the place can get a little noisy. I will definitely visit again though
1
We took our family here for a meal to celebrate a birthday. We told the waiting staff we needed help with navigating the menu and their only suggestion was to order the banquet. We then asked the to explain the various dishes and had very poor rushed explanations from staff with very poor english. No one in our group liked the bean paste dessert which, when paying $100++ per head, is disappointing. Would def never go back and recommend they employ staff with great english for those who aren't familiar with traditional Chinese dishes who don't speak mandarin
3
Surprised that this is a one star Michelin restaurant. Many better tasting Chinese options available st much better value. Service was surprisingly average at this price point
5
This restaurant serves a good range of dim sum for lunch. The dim sum was refined and tasty. The atmosphere is pleasant and staff efficient. Will certainly go back.
4
The decor is the biggest draw to this place. Food is good and service is excellent. The Dim Sum is tasty.
5
My third time here. The service and food here never fail me. Ordered the $108 set menu for my wife and I. The prawn and shark fin soup was superb.
5
My mum and I had dinner at Crystal Jade Palace to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent and service was also excellent! The waitress and host who attended to us were attentive and good with their recommendations.
5
By far one of the best I have had. Prices are a little more than other restaurants but it was worth it. I especially liked the wu kok, fu pi juan, char siew bao and xiao long bao.
4
Service was superb, it was not too quiet for family events, great location & amenities
Love the birthday surprise, but our allocated table could be at a better place for birthday event
4
The service, food and ambience is befitting of the reputation of this restaurant. It is known for its quality Cantonese and Teochew cuisine. It is furnished in a luxe decor and the tables are well spaced.
5
Went to this restaurant to celebrate a baby's full moon celebration. The private room was big enough to seat 16, with space to spare. A waitress was dedicated to serve this room for the whole night and her service was simply excellent.On the whole, the food in this restaurant was excellent. As many of the guests were vegans, many vegan dishes were ordered. Most of the vegan dishes were excellent.The Peking duck had such a beautiful appearance before it was skinned. When served with a layer pancake. the taste of the sauce was a little overpowering. Perhaps less sauce should be used. I prefer to the duck meat to be served plain and not fried with some vegetables. The duck meat was tender and tasted great. The roast chicken was excellent and was very reasonably priced. Almost half the price of the Peking duck. The fried beef cubes were excellent. It was much better than many steaks I have tried in western steak house. The braise beef brisket were sliced thinly. The taste was excellent but there should have a little more beef. The fish in Chinese wine was another winner. The taste of the Chinese wine was just right and not too strong. Perhaps the best dish of the night is the tofu in truffle sauce. Almost all of us voted this to the best dish of the night. It was so good, we ordered a second helping.I have not been to this restaurant for many years and I am glad I am back. The food has improved so much. The ambience of this restaurant was good. The staff were very polite and friendly. Definitely coming back again
4
The service and ambience in this restaurant is excellent. It is elegant without being shouting loud. The service team work together as one, and dishes are served smoothly and on time. They listen to your requests carefully, and follow up. All our questions regarding the dishes were well answered. All our dishes turned out very satisfactorily, except for one - the oyster omelette - the oysters were over cooked and tough. The Steamed Turbot fish was perfect- fresh and tender. The Beef cubes with garlic was deliciously tender and just right. The Fried rice with olive vegetable was aldente and interesting. The So La Mien was excellent.
5
Had dim sum with the family, most memorable dish was the cheong fun filled with fried salted egg yolk prawns
4
The waitresses were very patient and attentive in taking our order, making suggestions / recommendations, including advice on portions for 3 of us, and serving us the dishes.
4
Our go to for Peking Duck in Singapore! Outstanding service makes this Michelin star restaurant shine!
4
Decided to go to this restaurant after the recent Michelin announcement. Chose the Celebratory Dinner Set. Excellent food, except a strand of short hair was found in my son's noodle. But it was promptly replaced.
5
They gave us a good table, the service staff was knowledgeable and very helpful, food was good. Had a very pleasant lunch.
3
Had a set menu, most courses were actually very good. Wasn't impressed by dessert and drinks nor the service provided however. Staff's English was poor and they were not particularly friendly, for a place like this, just very disappointing.
5
This is my family's go-to place for important celebrations. The food is excellent, there's not one dish I can complain about, service is prompt and courteous, esp the manager at the front desk, and for this standard, prices are very reasonable.We had the sake foie gras, roasted quail, wasabi prawns, frogs legs in garlic sauce, champagne seafood rice and trio taster dessert. Everything was lovely and executed to perfection. All meats are tender, the wasabi prawns was creatively presented, strong (but not over powering) taste of sake in the foie gras.If I had to choose a fav, I'd say the foie gras and champagne rice. But u can't go wrong with any choice here
3
It was so bad at times that it started being really amusing.We ordered the tasting set and it indeed was an adventure - new angle of the Chinese dishes, interesting tastes and unexpected combinations.At the same time - a tablecloth with obviously old tea spots. Massive communication problems with all the waiters - English seems to be unpopular here. We were offered the drinks right after we were seated, we refused and asked for a couple minutes to decide - and got the drinks offered again. And again. And again.The set items were just brought to the table without any presentation - we had 2 different but similar sets and believe me it's not always easy to tell where's what. But even if you explicitly ask for explanation - is this the pork chop or the pork bone? - they just disappear, so we had to do the research by ourselves. I put my credit card into the bill, it gets carried away and then I get the sms message that the operation got declined - of course it was, I'm supposed to enter the pin number! Turns out they don't have the wireless terminals, which is not a problem at all, I'm ready to go to the bar counter but turns out it's not there either - I had to enter some utility closet where it's located.Ok, an adventure - both gastronomically and otherwise, but can't recommend. Especially can't understand how they obtained the Michelin star. It might be that the inspector spoke Chinese..
2
Fantastic service. Food was very good.But they have shark fin on the menu and so are complicit in the appalling shark fin fishing industry and trade.High time shark fin was banned in Singapore by law, but Crystal Jade are perfectly capable of getting out of this morally indefensible trade unilaterally by themselves.But clearly their management are evil.I won't be dining with them again
4
The foodhall that brings a gastronomic satisfaction from the Cantonese and Teochew cuisine. This restaurant did not disappoint me on this visit after several years passed. I still remember the time when I stumbled upon this restaurant that surprised me with fabulous dishes when most accidental dinners in Singapore did not. I was still lucky to find the quality has not been diminished. We arrived here near the closing of the lunch time, last food order. So there were only few dishes that could be selected. We had the Chef's Special - Soup of the Day, Seafood Fried Rice in Abalone Sauce wrapped in Lotus Leaf, Pan-fried Cod Fish with Black Truffle Sauce, Signature Roasted Suckling Pig and Tieguanyin. I always like the soup here, from the fancy-looking to the simpler one like the soup of the day. All food tasted really good, but one dish that sums up my experience was the seafood fried rice. Although the dish is written as 'fried rice', the taste and look was a bit similar to 'zongzi' where the rice is steamed and wrapped in leaves. The rice soaked up all the flavors from the beautiful ingredients mixed with the rice and formed a complete and savory meal for me to enjoy. There is almost no change to the interior of the restaurant. I still found the elegant and exclusive ambience of a Crystal Jade restaurant. The service was adequate, but it was not as good as my previous visits. The price is also a bit high with relatively small portion. Overall, I am happy with this experience and looking forward to visiting Crystal Jade Golden Palace again in another occasion
5
Never had any service issues at CJGP their services is wonderful and so far never fails throughout my years of visit. Kudos to the team.
5
The best dim sum I have ever had.
I took my brother a few weeks back and this dinner was just as amazing. Everyone must try the lamb!!! Cannot wait to be come back!
3
Roasted pork and drunken prawn are very excellent! Tim sum so so! Soups and desserts average ! Peking duck good
4
Having dinner in crystal jade never dissapointed. We always have ordered suckling pig and pork belly. Sweet sour pork also good. Taste is good and staff just averege.
3
Great food with a very good atmosphere. Staff are also very helpful but struggled to understand english and were not very good at giving suggestions. But they were friendly. THe dishes we had were nice although overall we felt the place was a bit overpriced
4
We tried the dim sum menu on a weekday lunch. Overall, the dim sum was of good quality, pricing was also reasonable for the quality and ambience. The cheong fun was particularly memorable as the texture was just right and melt-in-the-mouth.
5
Came for light lunch and ordered mainly dim sums and some ala carte dishes. Enjoyed every dish.
Food is consistently good.
4
I went to the restraunt in Takashimaya Department.
Nice atmosphere,and dim sum memu is good but not expencsive.
5
Please book ahead, this place is rated on Michelin and can get very crowded. I was lucky to get a table after walking in. The ambience was arresting. I picked the Celebration tasting menu which was good value. The food was exotic, subtle and delicious. Service was good, but sometimes they brought the next course to my table even before I was done with the previous course. The Black truffle noodles is a killer ! Lovely dinner
3
I was with 2 friends having simple dinner. I ordered 4 dishes to go with Teochew porridge. When 3 of the dishes put on our table, we had to wait for quite a while (between 10-15 minutes) for the arrival of porridge to go with the 3 dishes, that caused the 3 dishes not in the best conditions to be taken
4
Lovely internal decoration despite being located in a shopping mall, they offer all the classic Chinese stir frys, BBQ and dim sum.
The food and service is at a good level but targeted for the masses.
5
Had a business luncheon for few clients. Food was pretty good, service is good as well. Set menu was amazing.
5
The choices of dimsum for the starters of our supposedly lunch in this 1 star Michelin was endless. We made the right choices; everything was sumptuous and service was superb but we couldn't eat more. We'll definitely be back for the main entrees!
5
Nice ambient and excellent service.Foods were delicious with elegant presentation.
Prices are of good value.Highly recommended.
4
Enjoyed SGD 78 set menu, good enough to enjoy with family.
Likely visit again to try dim sum at lunch section.
4
We were here for dinner @ Paragon centre on 5th floor. There are 2 veg dim sims but only for lunch. The alovera soup, 2 starters we tried & crispy noodles with veggies were nice.
A little pricy though!!
5
One of the most delicious Chinese restaurants at reasonable prices in Singapore. No wonder this restaurant has been awarded "One Star Michelin", which means as the best restaurant in its category. All the food I uploaded here is very good. Highly recommended for Chinese food fans
4
If you need a restaurant with great ambience where you can have a good business discussion over lunch,'crystal jade at Paragon is my preferred choice. The dim sum was very good and selection is great. Restaurant is big but thankfully not too noisy like a lot other Chinese restaurants. Service was great and we had a very good lunch
4
It was nice that we were able to get seats for walk-in. It had a 2016 Michellin star poster- so why not try it out.Dark and really expensive looking. So expect to pay up.Food was good but serving size small-ish for the price. Fresh garoupa with soya sauce, chicken cashew, hot and sour soup, tenderloin with garlic were all top notch! Worth experiencing..
4
The food here is very nice. We're vegans and they have vegetarian dishes in the menu. The pan fried beancurd with truffle sauce and their soup in a coconut are particularly good. The steamed teochew dumplings are also delicious. Their manager Nigel is great at recommending. However, prices are not cheap
4
The food was delicious and pretty decent but could be of better value for the price paid. Portion was very small. We paid $250 for 4adults & 2 young kids under 5yo. Service was prompt nonetheless :)
4
Treated our US visitors to dim sum brunch here. Based in HK where good restaurants abound, they were impressed by the food. The service is not bad too. We will be back for more.
4
Went there with my family when we were in Singapore. We all enjoyed the food and the service. The restuarant was easily accessbile and the decor was very pleasant. The ambient was great. Food was excellent.
5
Excellent service from the team. We celebrated our daughter'a birthday there and the team ensured that we enjoyed our evening throughout.
5
This Crystal Jade has been my favourite! Never failed to impress my guests when we dine there, ordered the set menu 6-course set lunch and we think that it's value for money.
5
This is probably the best branch of the Crystal Jade group and the only one with a Michelin star. It specialises in Teochew dishes such as cold crab, pomfret porridge. Cantonese dishes served here like dim sum and barbecued meats and assorted seafood dishes are superb too! Happens to be the rice dumpling season, so we had the roasted duck and salted egg yolk today and it was 
5
We booked private room for 8 pax and the teochew dinner was exquisite. Totally deserving of the Michelin star. CJGP is one of the few Chinese restaurants that have ambient lighting, very nice setting and dim enough. Most Chinese restaurants are way too bright to be elegant and have zero atmosphere. This Chinese restaurant has the best of both worlds: too notch Chinese food with teochew and Cantonese cuisines + beautiful ambiance that has dim enough lighting!! My favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore
5
We enjoy dining at Crystal Jade Golden Palace for its quality food that is prepared with a touch of refinement. Getting the proper balance can be challenging for Chinese cuisine as flavors tend to be complementary. For us, refinement is about the subtlety of tastes. The chefs do a good job here.The restaurant's interiors are well decorated. The chandeliers from high ceilings are elegant. The tables are well spaced out and provide diners with a sense of privacy from the adjacent tables. This is unlike typical Chinese restaurants where tables are cramped together, and diners and staff take turns to navigate the passages. Yet, for all its upmarket ambience, it is not pretentious and one feels at ease dining here.Service is good. Soiled plates are changed. Staff are conversant with the menu offerings and happy to make recommendations. Despite the usual small, medium and large serving orders, some dishes are even prepared to suit the number of diners. Nice touch.Prices are higher but they reflect the quality of food served
5
Love the atmosphere here. Looks grand, elegant and yet comfortable at the same time. The roasted pork belly and fish maw are to die for. The salted egg baked live prawns and XO carrot cake are simply divine. I wish I could have more of it! The desserts - combination of plum jelly, pandan cake and black glutinous rice with ice cream - are somewhat of a lack buster - tasted well, but I expected much more especially coming from a michelin star restaurant. Nonetheless, their cook dishes are very well executed and delectable. I will not hesitate to come back here again! "
4
I visited the restaurant with a group of 6, no reservations and restaurant was full. They had us share a room private with 3 other tables. Our order for half a suckling pig, peking duck, crispy prawns, a couple of veggie dishes was served in less then 30 minutes. My group was happy with the food and service and we left filled and happy
5
The atmosphere was conducive.. Food was sumptuous. Soup was very tasty. Dim sum was very good. Service was excellent. Was ushered to the table. Waitress who served us was courteous & friendly. Highly recommended.
4
Discovered this restaurant more than 20 years ago and have been coming back whenever I am in Singapore. So far I have yet to be disappointed.
5
Its been a while since I had dinner in this restaurant.. So I was amazed with their new menu: the angel hair pasta with seafood and truffle was a refreshing and delicious addition. Definitely, a come back!
5
Excellent food and very attentive service. Staff helpful and willing to accommodate vegetarian choices not on menu.
5
This restaurant offers fine Chinese dining, and even though already around for quite some time, they have some excellent dishes on offer that are really worth a try. It's peaceful environment adds to the experience and the staff is experienced, efficient and pleasant.
4
We and 3 other couples had a delightfully dinner last night.
Excellent Cantonese style food, birds nest, shark fin, live fish and others. All cooked to perfection.
Excellent wine selection and service was top notch!
4
My good friend ( well connected local foodie) took us to this restaurent 20 plus years ago , located within the high end mall at the time Ngee Ann city , it was then regarded as the best Cantonese cuisine in Singapore . The experience at that time was excellent both for dim sum and dinner , we were treated very nicely because of my friend connection .Crystal Jade now has over 100 franchise in 25 cities over the world , I have tried the ones in HK, Bejiing , San Francisco and in airport terminals in HK and Singapore . The level of food and service varies , generally good . For this original place in Singapore , the dim sum hours hectic , try to get a private room , or else you may not get good service , food is on par with the better HK dim sum places , soup dumpling always good . DInner get a private room too , high level banquet style cantonses food , expensive . I will not go by ourself( always go with locals) , I have heard service and wait can be inconsistent
5
Crystal Jade Golden Palace often gives me fond memories. Over the years, many years, it delivered, failed to deliver and was even so, so only during my visits.But, last week, lunch at Crystal Jade Golden Palace was a superb treat for a group of 7.The verdict, a feast par excellence.Everything, especially the dim sum starter of fried beancurd skin with seafood was so fresh and non-oily - the best I have had in eons. Peking duck was fragrant, the cod was also excellent. Am definitely going to make many more trips there to try out more of their dishes.She's at her peak and it's a thumbs-up for anyone, local or tourists to experience both the food and ambiance
4
This restaurant is ideal for a larger group so that you order across the very large menu. Since it was just the two of us we had just the one dish â€” Peking duck.It was excellent, the staff very friendly and service quick. Will surely visit again with friends
4
Having not been back to Crystal Jade Golden Palace for some time, I was looking forward to dinner there with a good friend. The meal was light on the palate, yet very flavourful. The other key highlight was the impeccable service; the staff was polite and very patient with our requests. I am looking forward to my next meal there, hopefully in the near future
5
Wandering around an ordinary shopping precinct came across this place .decided to book when I noticed the Michelin star sign.What a delight.Great food including Peking duck, pork in a sweet sauce and wonderful fragreent rice.
good service and reasonably priced for the quality.
5
One of my all time favorites anywhere in the world. Belies it's shopping Centre locale. Amazing quality and brilliant service it really is one of the many diamonds in a city awash with superb eating destinations.
4
Nice ambience and good quality, consistent food. Service was also good. But it has a M star so it should be good!
A good option for overseas guests to experience Asian food in a nice environment.
4
I love the sucking pig. Crispy but the portion is a little. Try their sweet and sour pork. It is really good. The melon soup is sweet and refreshing. If you dare, frog leg is super. Huge and meaty.
4
Nice Ambient to enjoy Teowchew cuisine. Service personnel is thoughtful, however is insufficient to cater the customers, we need to wait sometime before they can answer our call. Nice food worth a try
5
Restaurant has been accorded the "Michelin 1-Star" and the reasons are obvious: excellent food, attentive service, and first-rate ambience. Quite disappointing however that Crystal Jade now imposes a Corkage Fee. We found ourselves having to decide between opening our own NZ Marlborough or buying the Margaret River Sauvignon Blanc from the restaurant's Wine List
4
We visited the Crystal Jade Palace at Paragon Singapore on 30 December. Service was good, friendly and efficient. The food was lovely and there was a good wine selection. Overall cost was pricey but that was mainly the alcoholic drinks. It's a Michelin star restaurant and you get what you pay for
5
Had dinner here and must say that this is probably one of the few Chinese dining place that can match the western michellin places in terms of service and food. The service staff gave us full attention from star to end and were not distracted by the numerous children that were present. Food was great especially the suckling pig roll with glutinous rice. The skin was so good, it is worth every bite you put to it but rather sinfully. The service staff were excellent and our glasses were never left empty. Keep the flag flying Crystal Jade Golden Palace and let other Chinese places emulate your quality in terms of food and service
4
There were 4 of us and we ordered half a Peking duck, Mustard Greens with crab meat, Crab Meat Ee-Fu noodles and Sauteed Grouper. For dessert, we had a 2 Or Nee and 1 Mango, Sago, Pomelo with Coconut ice cream. The Peking Duck was quite small and each of us had only 2 pieces wrapped in the pancake with scallions, cucumber and sweet sauce. The duck meat was bland but to be fair, they had forwarned us that it would taste that way. The Mustard Greens with Crab Meat was nicely done with some mushroom and egg white garnishing. There was a generous portion of crab meat in the Mustard Green dish. The Grouper meat was sliced and fried with scallions and onions. This was expertly done. The Ee-Fu noodles was nicely done, not too dry and just moist enough with adequate amount of crab meat. The 2 desserts were OK but not outstanding. Portions we felt were a bit small especially the Mango, Sago Pomelo with coconut ice cream. All in, the standard was fairly good and consistent with my previous visits. The charge for Chrysanthemum tea was $3.80 per person which we thought was quite stiff. The total bill came to $189 for 4 of us
5
It was difficult securing a weekend reservation since the restaurant earned a star, so it was great that we managed to dine on a weekday. The service that day was exceptional. It was politely suggested to us when our server thought we might have over ordered. In addition, when we queried on why the steamed rice rolls (cheong fun) was thicker than what we usually have here, we were old it was to cater to the general feedback. However, we can request for thinner rolls next time we dine, which is great.The place also looked brighter with new chandeliers, making it inviting.
5
Great food , great service and reasonable Please try the baby oyster porridge with prawn roles and stewed yunnan ham cabbage

Crystal Jade, i was at this resto last Sunday on my three days trip to Singapore, the xiao long Bao was really nice, as well as the pork belly ramen,, slurppp slurppp... yummy.. but price was not cheap a..

We eat yum Cha at this restaurant yesterday and it was fantastic. The service was attentive and the food delicious! Try the shrimp dumplings and the chive ones too!
4
My kids love this restaurant for the fried rice and kungpao chicken...they have nice sambal as well...there is a beef item which we regularly order, cant remember the name, which is also very tasty...
the service is awesome...
5
Server was attentive and courteous. Food was terrific and it really impressed my parents a lot. If was a good choice that I have made to celebrate my mother's birthday there!
5
Had a fantastic meal here and as I'm a fan of Peking Duck, had to choose this. Absolutely delicious. I chose the smallest size but it was huge. Also had some dim sum which was very good. Recommend this as a reasonably priced restaurant which has high quality foo
1
First of all- it's a mall- so act like it 2nd of all - food isn't good at all and overpriced- I get it, they try to have nice surroundings and it's all about the atmosphere... but c'mon... there are tourist in shorts sitting next to someone,who hasn't washed for 3 days- if you want to go to the bathroom, they'll show you the way out of the restaurant into a mallbathroom... and so on3rd- most of the staff is watching you very closely, some will feel comfortable with that ,because the staff reacts to your every need - but for me, it felt like they're trying too hard, they behave, like a white person never has been to a nice restaurant before...so my personal advice- there are better and cheaper malls or food courts in singapor
5
Was there for lunch. First time there including my guest. Had high expectations of the food since it has been awarded the 1-star Michelin award in Singapore. Took the set lunch and requested to change the appetizer to the one from the other set lunch menu but had to pay extra. Overall, food was great and service was good too. One thing to caution is that the pickles which was placed automatically on the table is chargeable and they are expensive considering the small portion. If you don't eat it, request to remove them. Had chrysanthemum tea for both of us and it's S$3.80++ per person and that's exorbitant. This place has got good ambience, great place for business and family
4
I have entertained three times lately and the service has gone from bad to worse and we ate early from noon. Our dim sum dishes did not come at once and in ten twenty mins intervals. I was embarrassed as my good friends complained of the service. The food is good - no complaints but just late and slow
5
Located within Paragon Shopping Centre. Restaurant, when entered, looked inviting with grandeur. Double volume and spacious unlike rest of other CS Jade Kitchen outlets. Service was ok, not outstanding like CS Jade Prestige- probably due to dinner crowd. However the food we ordered were simply delicious- Garoupa with Chinese wine, seafood fried rice, Kurobuta pork and foie gras starter. Prices were reasonable costing $130 with 6 dishes + tea.
5
This restaurant has been around for many years but the interior is still impeccable. They have good, attentive staff. I love the dim sum here, especially the Xiao long Bao. The stone bowl sharks fin has a very generous serving.
5
By sharinWe were 7 of us and we went for dinner. We arrived only at 9.30 and the staff were excellent.
The food was amazing and the service great . All in all we had a wonderful time
4
Service is good as usual food can give 8/10 dim sum so so only , above average but not so memorable.
5
Food is good and we have enjoyed. Good for non vegetarian where you have lots to choose. One will enjoy having food at this place. I recommend one to visit.

My first meal after I arrived in Singapore was dim sum at Crystal Jade. As usual it was very good. As it was Sunday, things were a bit crazy, but the staff handled it fairly well. The dim sum was tasty and the vegetables I ordered on the side were also good, though they cost more than all my dim sum
5
Become a Jadite for Sp$38 and enjoy discounts in the chain of restaurants in Singapore. I had delicious dim sum lunch including thinly sliced, crispy suckling pig, fresh and slightly crunchy fried prawn ball and delectable hot and sour soup at the Paragon branch. I have been to the Takashimaya restaurant and it is equally good. The restaurants are well managed and employ older staff who are highly motivated and empathize with 'senior citizens'. A highly sensible policy given Singapore's ageing demographics. Keep it up, Crystal Jade managemen
5
Elegant surroundings, excellent service and delicious food. Nestled in between the high end shops on Singapore's famous Orchard Road this restaurant is not to be missed.The cereal coated prawn and the 'melt in your mouth' cubed beef were my personal favourites, although the crispy belly port was a delight too. A light, tasty Mango dessert finished our meal off nicely. Westerners should embrace the atmosphere in what I would suggest is a locals 'best kept secret' restaurant. Book in advance
5
This restaurant is a must visit every time I go to Singapore. This is a Chinese restaurant that serves delicious dishes at all times. Service is quick and efficient . Staff are friendly and helpful and extremely knowledgable with respect to the menu. You can always rely on them to give you great advice on the specialties of the house. Peking Duck is served here and very delicious. Great dim sum here also. The place is quite spacious so should be a great venue for large dinners and parties. You can reserve areas for special occasions.Great Food. Great service, Great ambience. Ideal location on Ochard road, the main shopping area. Shop the whole day and then walk here to enjoy a great dinner

Came here with family for a dinner. We ordered the Peking Duck. The first serving was the Peking Duck skin to go with the crepes. Instead of laying out each wrap nicely on a larger plate, they were all stacked up on top of each wrap on a small plate, resulted in the wraps being stuck to another. This is unexpected especially for one which has a Michelin star and one which serves Peking Duck as a specialty. This disappointment was later compensated with better service from a lady captain.
4
It is located in the high end Paragon Mall in the heart of the shopping district.Professional and prompt staff. A bit dull and dark interior, but very well maintained and decorated.We had some dim sum, Peking duck, stir fried greens, pork belly, hokkien noodles... Very well done and presented. The taste was consistently very good . Overall, certainly worth a visit for a formal dinner for some authentic Chinese Singaporean cuisine
5
Great dim sum. Quality. Value. Ambience. Suitable for most occasions. Service was attentive and efficient.
5
I took my date for a birthday Dinner and she loved it a lot. I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends. It was amazing!
5
Outstanding Asian Cuisine par none! Yum yum in a big way! Truly one of the great restaurants in Singapore!
5
The restaurant serve very good suckling pig even when we ordered it on the spot. We had an excellent dining experience with this restarant.
4
We went there for dinner. Table was ready as per reservation time. Cozy ambience. Foods were delicious. Served quickly. Service is average. A little bit over priced.
4
The servers were super attentive to our dining needs and were around to constantly supplementing our food and tea.You gotta try the garlic beef, it melts in your mouth as you try them.Even if you are not familiar to traditional Asian cuisine the types of food that this restaurant cooks and serves is easy for Westerners to enjoy
5
I once again re-visited Crystal Jade in the Paragon, Orchard Rd. This restaurant is so consistent in its food, presentation and service.We enjoyed Duck with crepes and then in a salad combination, the Crispy skin chicken, which is just to "die for" and the green beans with pork mince, a real delight;Accompany this with an egg fried rice and you'll be back for more.The service is casual yet attentive and the atmosphere quite serene.Highly recommende
5
The hot stone shark fin soup is so delicious that I can't express in word. Try it out! The food is awesome . The soft bone pork is fantastic also. The pot of tea need improvement. Not hot after 10 min left on table. Probably need to place the pot on top warmer with candle
5
Popped in for a late lunch dim sum between shopping and really enjoyed the food. We ordered about 10 dishes off the a la carte dim sum and they were all really, really good. Had chicken feet black bean, seafood dumplings, Xiao long bao, pork belly and the bbq pork in pastry. Service was quick and attentive with water and tea constantly filled. I loved it
4
Despite having 12 people having the dinner, we were offered a shared room. Service was good. But broke some plates which I think was bad because it is a birthday for my mother. Otherwise, the rest was above average but not fantastic. Food vs price, only the suckling pig was awesome. The rest, is all about the brand.
4
Good food though dining later in evening mid week seemed to mean less attentive staff. Peking duck very good and all food on the money.
5
located in Ngee Ann City, this is one of the most decent Chinese Restaurant with good dim sum in Singapore. Price a bit higher than that of Hong Kong, but quality is good and roast pork is the best.
4
We patrionise this lovely restaurant quite often and we consistently recieve excellent food and service always. Thank you and keep up good job
4
Our soups and duck were very good. The coconut icecream on mango puree also nice and refreshing. Casual atmosphere, will go back.
5
We had the ala carte menu as it offered more variety then the set meal. The food is yummy and I especially like the pork chops. The service is good and the staff gave helpful recommendations on which dishes to order.
5
We went for Dim Sum. There are many Dim Sum places in Singapore and also many that are good. Crystal Jade Golden Palace was just even a bit better with most of the dishes. And that in a beautiful atmosphere with a high ceiling. Really good were: roasted pork belly, glutinous rice in lotus leave, bbq pork bun (less sweet and much better than any I had before), amazing (!) egg tarts, very good hot and sour soup. I wouldn't order the Xiao Long Bao again - their taste was fine but each of them broke as the skin seemed too thin. But maybe I waited to long which made them stick to the basket.
2
We had a family lunch for 8 people on a Sunday. due to the number of people, we had to take the later session starting from 1.30pm. It was quite a bit of wait outside the restaurant. My dad found it tiring.Food was the usual dimsum fare in a semi- private room. Buns were too sweet though fluffy and light, deep fried 'elephants' came with biscuits that were too hard to eat but pretty to look at. We couldn't forget the 'mango' packet which is , horror of horrors, mayonaise wrapped with deep fried crepe. We had mustard greens garnished with scallop floss. They were the biggest stalks we have ever eaten, because they were big and chunky. Eating them wasn't glam. Worse of all, the sauce became very liquid after the dish cooled down.We were deafened by another group in the room and tolerated the din until they left. Had it not been for them, I would have given an extra point for ambience.One more thing. The restaurant had black tiles on the walls and floor. It made walking difficult esp for my elderly father who almost fell.
5
Eager to check out its offerings (mainly because it was recently awarded one Michelin star), I opted for the Executive set lunch. The food was delicately prepared, and was a visual and gastronomical feast. The portions were also generous - I came with a hearty appetite but had to takeaway the dessert, and I could not manage anymore. Service was attentive (e.g. prompt tea refills). Very nice, classy ambience too. Doesn't come cheap, but worth the occasional splurge
4
Crystal Jade Golden Palace has always been my top chinese restaurant and so I was delighted it was awarded Michelin star recently! Most chinese restaurants are too bright with harsh lighting which makes it very difficult to relax and have a nice slow meal. CJGP is different, it's ambiance is beautiful and I love their standing chandelier lighting and elegant atmosphere. Lighting is soft and romantic and can be recommended as a nice romantic date place too (which is rare for chinese restaurants). Food is competent always but service is inconsistent (sometimes good sometimes not so good). My family loves this place and will continue to support them
4
we tried one bird (peking duck) and had the meat fried with yee fu noodle. in addition we ordered fish maw soup, hot and sour spicy soup and crab corn soup. also tried the cereal prawns, long beans in minced pork, fried carrot cake in xo sauce.overall food taste and quality is good. but timing of serving the dishes have plenty of room for improvement. we ordered the signature fried carrot cake with xo sauce which was the appetiser starter but it came after the soups and duck in wraps.somehow everything was served on an ad hoc basis. it was like whats cooked first served first. hope there could be some order in our next visit.service staff was friendly and experienced. no pressure at all. helpful and we had a good family time over meal
5
Food quality excellent; reminder of possible over order; staff services at high standard; especially soup and peking duck which are the best dishes we had;
4
Crystal Jade Golden Palace is a great chinese restaurant located in the Paragon Centre. The wine list and menu is extensive. We choose a yum Cha which was delicious
3
Food OK but for the price and Michelin star, we fully expected course timing and hot food to be the normal. Instead , food was not served in any good order e.g. Duck went cold waiting for pancakes etc. Staff need to think this through much more carefully. They should also make clear that dim-sum is NOT served in evenings
4
Went to this restaurant with friends. Large and nice ambience with good service. The lobster in Singapore sauce is nice, cod in Thai style is good but the prawns in soy sauce were average. Loved the vegetable fried rice and mango pudding. Didn't get Dimsums in dinner which I was looking forward to.
3
This restaurant got its 1 Michelin star. I have to say I am rather surprised as I was neither impressed with the food nor the experience. Maybe they did well when the Michelin inspectors were there. I was there for a celebration with my colleagues and booked the private room. Though the no of waitresses were sufficient, they did not have the attentiveness nor the notion of fine dining.Though it is a private room, and I can understand that the door has to be opened and closed with each dish, the door remained open majority of the time for the convenience of the waitresses. This take off lots of points in my opinion. The objective of having a private room is to have privacy and out from the ambiance noise. The waitresses took out the privacy from this celebration.I have to say the majority of the food was at least above the average you would find in regular restaurants. But there were a couple of dishes which I find it short of a Michelin star restaurant. When they served the chilli crab dish, it was a crab claw doused in the chilli sauce. The taste was good. We finished this dish and my colleague was telling me that its a waste to the sauce and we should go and buy some bread to go with it jokingly. At this point of time. all of us in the 2 tables have all finished this dish. To our surprise, the waitresses then took in 2 plates of Mantou. The Mantou should have been served with the crab claws and the waitresses forgotten about it for about 10-15 mins. The dessert was also a let down. It was chocolate ice cream with avocado cream(i think). I was looking at my scoop of chocolate ice cream with many ??? when it was served as the ice cream was already melting. This dessert definitely did not look good and taste good. To me, there may be a limit to the cost of the food but its the experience that make the meal one above the rest. This chinese restaurant definitely did not rise above the rest, in my opinion
4
I have been eating here regularly since 2005. Quality and service have been consistent. Good Cantonese cuisine. Is it deserving of one Michelin? Maybe.Not too creative with food offering. Certainly excel at flavour. I was impressed with angel hair pasta with truffle oil, Szechuan chicken with cashews and peppercorn, and miso cod
5
The restaurant is right at the top of the shopping mall so you either have to take the lift or ride the escalator up all 5-6 floors. I've been here with my family for weekend dim sum lunch a number of times prior to it being listed in the Singapore Michelin Guide 2016. Oh yes, this is rated 1 star on the guide! I've never selected food outside of the dim sum menu - which in itself already offers a good variety of food. On the dim sum, I would say this is by far the best dim sum restaurant in Singapore. Stone me, hate me, but I am certain this is the best dim sum place in Singapore. Coupled with hospital staff, cosy atmosphere, ample seating, (did I also mention the Shanghainese themed deco with multiple layers of seating? - pretty awesome!), and child friendly.Must try (dim-sum menu only):- Steamed dumpling soup- Teochew sliced fish porride- Pan fried carrot cak
3
The roast duck for two was $22 - the portion measly and the pieces were full of bones. The dimsum was okay, but nothing to write home about. I think this place used to be great; but it is now very expensive ($70+ for two for dimsum brunch) and really quite mediocre. Sad
3
@TheKuoKnowsI went to Crystal Jade only because its better-known competitor at the other end of Paragon Shopping Centre was fully booked. It was a revelation.The waiting staff was ultra-attentive; the tables were well spaced and the decor bordered on palatial. That should all add up to pleasant dining experience.The Peking Duck was superb. It was as good as its arch rival's. I asked them to chop up the duck, rather have them prepare another dish from the meat. It's more economical - zero cost. I also think that eating the meat off the bone is altogether more enjoyable.If I had one complaint, it would be that a few more pancakes would not have gone amiss. I asked for more and the restaurant charged $8 for them. A little excessive, I thought.The Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs were delightfully tender. No complaints there. The Kai Lan was cooked to perfection too.All in all, a pleasant experience, save for the additional charge for the pancakes. It spoilt an otherwise enjoyable meal.But that I guess is what can happen when a Private Equity company is running the show, rather than a customer-focussed restaurateur, who is looking for repeat business.It takes years to build a reputation. But it can be ruined in a second by a bad penny-pinching decision over a basket of pancakes

We had the birthday dinner for my teenage son at Crystal jade. It looked like we booked it a bit too early as when you come at 7:30pm the whole place is full with parents w young kids and it is prey noisy. Nothing at young kids but every table was with young parents so the whole atmosphere was more like a family restaurant and the dress code of this parents were amazing: tank tops for the guys, shorts flip flops , caps etc... So pretty much like a beach place. I had the golden palace more in memory of a stylish place. So after 8pm the crowd changed. The food was outstanding and exquisite , every dish we had was great from Peking duck, cereal prawns to chicken and cod fish and green beans. Hence my overall evaluation. The staff was also mixed. When we ordered the waitress didn t even look at us. When we paid we greeted very friendly. So my verdict: food very good but service needs to improve and pick the right time if you want a more elegant evening setting

Business lunch
Waiter was confused with our order
Wrong dishes turned up
Staff helpful in bringing correct order eventually
Food good quality
Restaurant has a good reputation locally Think just unlucky on the day we got the wrong dishes
5
yum, yum yum yum yum yum
is all i can say about the food that is served here, the ambiance is beautiful, The service is excellent.
5
Had lunch here today with friends - their special 40% discount duck - dim sum to start, crispy duck, duck rice and duck with noodles. Food was delicious and service attentive. A really good value and delicious lunch. Love the orchids at the entrance.
4
I see another reviewer thinks the food is a bit expensive. Eight of us had lunch for $25 each which seemed fair. The food was good and nicely varied. It's in Ngee Ann City on Orchard Road
5
Great dim sum and many of the dishes, though our server was a bit lack of attentive.
We had great lunch.
Highly recommended.
1
Went there for lunch on Sunday at around 1130. Was at the reception and asked for a table for 6. The counter told us that there was a table but we need to finish our dining by 130pm. That was fine with us. When we were ready to go in, they told us that we now have to finish our meal by 1230 as they just had another reservation! Halo!! We are not here to swallow our good in an hour just so you can make $$$ and put in as many reservations as you can! We were upset and of course did not go for lunch there. We walked across to the Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant - Paragon, service was AMAZING and we were not chased out nor told we have to eat as fast for the next diner
5
As a fan of yum cha I decided to take Mum to this place. We were firstly told we may have to wait 10-20 minutes to be seated, we were then seated in 5 minutes. The service was amazing and our server was so attentive. We then ordered the yum cha and a couple of entrees and the food came out in good time even though it was super busy. The food was sooooo fresh and the flavours so amazing. When we received the bill we thought it was a little od you have to pay for absolutely everything from the hand towels to the condiments, but in the end, we didn't care as this place and the food was so amazing and so worth i
5
I have been coming to this restaurant for many, many years when I visit Singapore. It is the first place I want to eat at as their food is consistently exceptional. The BBQ Combination Platter with belly pork, roast duck and roast pork is made to perfection. Peking duck is always good, along with their dim sum (Ha Kau and Shanghai soupy dumpling is my favorite). I recommend this restaurant for authentic Chinese cuisine, it will be an unforgettable culinary experience.

brought an oversea visitor to dinner the other day. It was either crystal jade or imperial treasure. so i picked crystal jade. we were shown into the nice huge restaurant, and seated in the middle of the room, even though there were tables at the side. nevermind, perhaps it was because we had no prior reservation. they have a good extensive menu. lovely photos and price wise, decent - to be expected in an orchard road hotel, situated in a shopping mall. I selected 3 items, 2 items of which I pointed to the waitress who took our order. the second item, i gave her the item code without showing her the picture. she did not even write down the order nor repeat them. wow.. great memory right she has right? wrong! only 2 of orders arrived. so we waited for a while. nothing.. So my visitor asked the same waitress who took our order what happened to the other dish. Her immediate response was 'she (meaning I) did not order'. Such audacity to not even apologise but to put the blame on me! i was taken aback, but did not correct her, just in case. so while the food was reasonably good, the service totally spoilt the evening for us
5
Whenever I stop in Singapore, this is my go-to restaurant for Dim Sum. It has delicately made dishes and a huge variety. I also like to order from the main menu which has so many dishes to choose from that I usually have trouble deciding what to order. Even the dessert menu is fantastic. If you are going on a weekend, please remember to book as they are always full. All their dishes are amazing
4
My visit to crystal jade was a very good experience as always . Only this time they messed up serving one of the main dishes last after everyone had finished their food it was really odd . But overall their standard has been maintained.
4
Crystal Jade Golden Palace is used to be one of my favourite places for Chinese Food, however, after the downsizing of the restaurant, food standard and services seems fluctuate up and down. Nevertheless, they still serve good food.
4
one fo the better dim sum in the city. very typical chinees setting and excellent food. service is fast and efficient
2
It's a shame because the food is good but the service is terrible.The waitress brought us the bill during the main course. We hadn't finish our meals yet !We don't understand why the restaurant accept late reservation if it is to kick you at the end 
1
The food here is very good but a bit expensive. I especially liked their teochew duck and combination platter. I have been a regular to this restaurant. I found hair in my food and told the manager about it. They offered to change my food, but since the hair was found after the food was half finished, I told the manager that it is alright. The restaurant did not charge us for our desserts as apologies. But, on a repeated visit, we found hair in our food again. We have decided that we don't visit the restaurant for a while
4
We have been to Crystal Jade many times and never disappointed. We travel quite a bit, and therefore prefer a place to eat that we are comfortable with and familiar with. We return to this restaurant as we always feel welcome and are looked after very well. Great staff often suggest daily dishes. We started with a small portion of crispy pork and cha-siu, followed by an incredible steam fish with ginger dish (an all-time favourite), and a simple garlic and soya sauce vegetables, and finished with a very refreshing mix fruit of mango, rock melon and water melon. All in all very satisfied and left happy !
5
Travel on my own quite a bit, and therefore eat on my own. I return to this restaurant as I always feel welcome and am looked after very well. Great staff often suggest daily dishes - I had an incredible beef dish and a very refreshing dessert served in a chilled coconut. This Crystal Jade has a very elegant interior
3
This is for the the one in Paragon. My family has been coming here for years and on a very regular basis and only recently, specifically today did we notice a change in menu, quality and quantity of the food. They seem to be pushing for expensive set menus. We ordered a many dishes as usual, however the quantity of the food was exceptional small to the point that i thought this was a tapas restaurant. We made a comment to the manager and the rest of the dishes seems slightly more adequate. Unfortunately, i think many have expressed the same views and many of us probably won't be returning
4
great dim sum tried many of the dishes they had the service was excellent our server was very attentive and friendly ..we had great sticky pork bun, different soups and in the end ordered too much food. We took the left overs home and even the packaging was done so well.Recommend it but with reservations as it is very busy I am not sure about the different foods from Hong Kong, Shanghai as we had the dim su
4
Best was the service from Ms Goh Chai Hong who helped me to carry a bag all the way to the entrance as I was in crutches. So kind of her.White bait - lovely; light and crispy and not oily - very good.Teochew crystal skin dumplings with chives - good but I don't like the taste of chives, can be a little green.Meatballs - not bad although I am not into meatballsPomfret fillet porridge - goodDried Chilli shrimps on rice rolls - very niceXO sauce carrot cake with egg and bean sprouts - goo
5
Nice Cantonese restaurant serving tasty Cantonese dishes and good choices of wines. Recommend dishes are the roasted pig, the herb double boiled soup and beef.
Good service and clean place with reasonable price.
3
Good place for dim sum, ambience is good, service is good. But nothing great and exceptional. Can try if you like dim sum.
5
Visited this place at paragon mall recently with two friends both vietnemese nationals.Being a vegetarian I was not happy with the menu card although my friends were really excited with the items on offer.I have to make a special mention for the manager on floor who customised a fantastic vegetarian menu for me.It wasn't as if I made any compromise. Meals were sumptuous and delicious. Ambience was good and the location obviously on Orchard Road cannot be bettered.Will visit again when in town.
5
Work colleagues and I ate there last night and we all felt it was outstanding. The restaurant is much nicer than what it looks from outside the Paragon mall, however once seated, we were presented with a very exotic menu to choose from, so we stuck with what we knew.We had half a Peking duck, then a duck meat and asparagus stir fry, beans and minced pork, fried rice and finished up with noodles.All were delicious and we left feeling very satisfied. Would definitely go back
5
The food was well presented and taste delicious. jelly crabmeat, mince pork, crab glutinous rice, all. Rey well made. The ambience was good as well as we were given a semi enclosed area. However, the waitress wasn't too patient to introduce the food to us and went off mid wa
2
Located at Paragon. Can be quite a disappointment if you do not like citrus peels. They include this in many dishes. What is frustrating I have to request for changes and they only got it 3rd time right. That is very bad for a fine dining restaurant. Also , staff put their fingers in when I requested for a spare bowl. Yikes
4
we called in to the CJGP as the restaurant we were aiming for was being refurbished. My local friend ordered some cold crab, goose wings and many more foods and Dim Sum's that I enjoyed but had little clue what it was. It was all great and the service was very attentive. I saw the Peking Duck being served to many tables and it all looked fabulous
4
Very very good Peking Duck - perfect skin- and the meat was then ground and cooked and served in lettuce wraps. The shrimps in garlic sauce were amazing as well. Thought the food was very fresh. The service was competent and friendly. Nice large dining room where you can have a table and still each other talk.
5
The restaurant has a classy atmosphere to it. We ordered some dim sums and a peking roasted duck. All items we ordered tasted very good.The service was excellent. One of the waitresses really took good care of us.The price was reasonable and we came out of this restaurant full and happy
3
My friend chose this place for lunch. Very crowded but the food was good and the service was attentive - actually alittle too attentive as the server was barely 5 feet away from the table, so I am sure she could listen into the entire conversation. What was a put off was that we were told 3/4 of the way through lunch that we had to finish up and get the check in the next 15 mins as our allocated dinning time was up and another party was waiting. Huh - why weren't we told when we were seated ?? had to gobble down the remainder meal. 2 stars off

'
Saturday Dinner
Waited 40mins for food to be served
Waited 30mins to settle payment
Why would we bother to eat here again ?
We were disgusted with your WASTING OUR TIME.
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.
4
Wonderfully fresh dim sum and perfect service given our guests arriving at different times. Lovely dumplings, congee and veggies. Definitely return.
3
We were a party of two and ordered soup, fried rice, roasted chicken and a vegetable dish. Bill came to just under S$110. This is pricy in my opinion considering the chicken was dry and the soup were 2 small individual bowls. Maybe dim sum would be better. Would not recommend because of the dry chicken and price. Service was fine
5
No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the Crystal Jade Golden Palace at Paragon on Orchard Road. Whether you are looking for a quick meal or a more leisurely paced one, just tell the staff & they'll oblige. Efficient & courteous service + consistent & good food = good experience every time.
4
Had dinner with family ordered the Chilly Crab and few other dishes for 4.First time trying Crystal Jade Chilly Crab, a bit disappointed with their unique recipe using ginger flower that giives a very pungent taste to the sauce. I prefer the traditional chilly crab .Other dishes were good as usual. Price is on the high side, but quality is good
5
Loved the food. We were primarily vegetarian and found lots of options- all fantastic. Especially loved the kiddy- decorated bao- one being a custard cream bin and the other a red bean paste bun (I think). I don't remember what we ate but everything from the dimsum to main course was exemplary.
4
This is the top Crystal Jade outlet in Singapore, and for good reasons. Service is impeccable - polite, helpful and foreseeing customers' wishes. Some dishes have ridiculous names (like the one with Evian broth!! Was it designed for MJ??), but overall the food is very good, even if it's not too creative. The decor is a bit chi-chi, but does convey class. To be commended, especially since the food standards at almost all the other Crystal Jade outlets in Singapore have deteriorated noticeably in the recent past
5
It is located at 5th Floor of Paragon Shopping Mall in Orchard Road, just next to Lucky Plaza or across Mount Elizabeth Hospital. There are several branches of Crystal Jade restaurants, and this Crystal Jade Golden Palace is for fine dining, but they also serve dim sum and casual meals. Most of the meals here are very delicious, don't mention about shark fins, bird nests, sea cucumber, steam Garoupa/soon hock fish, Peking Duck which are quite expensive, you could also order ordinary dimsum, the best roasted pork, fish congee, seafood with celery, or also black pepper beef with more economic price. So, when you go to Singapore, don't forget to visit one of Crystal Jade branches with your family or with business partners
5
I always enjoy coming back to this restaurant and it has never let me down.Took two friends for lunch on our short visit to Sinapore and had a pretty big range of yum cha, which was all very good. Service was also very good and had not dropped since my last visit two years ago.Will be back again one day
5
We had dinner here before we headed to the airport. The food was amazing! The menu very different to an 'Australian Chinese' menu, which is not great when eating with kids, but we found something for them and we all loved the dishes. Service was very quick and attentive. Would definitely eat here again when in Singapore
4
Good selection of well prepared Chinese cuisine and good ambience. Good dinning experience. The Beijing duck was good but a little cold. The Teochew cold crab and yam dessert was very good.
4
The restaurant has a intimate atmosphere, wide selection of chinese food. The food was very tasty with fair price.
5
You can't really go wrong with the Crystal Jade Group. They're always consistent, across their whole range of restaurants catering to different budgets. We had the set dinner to celebrate a family member's birthday at their higher end restaurant,Golden Palace, today. Menu was standard, more or less what you would find in a set at any Cantonese restaurant, including competing chains like Imperial Treasure and Tung Lok. Dishes were well executed though, and service thoughtful. Decor was also very tasteful. Recommended.
5
Loved this place for its awesome food. I highly recommend you make reservations when you get here as this place could be packed. Since I was a guest here, I do not know most of the dishes I had, but listing a few I didKung Pao Chicken Prawn Dumplings Sesame Prawns : Very nicely done. We had 2 portions of this Spinach Tofu : Never had this dish and simply loved it for its tenderness and tasteOverall highly recommended and a must have meal restaurant. Please feel free to ask any questions regarding this place :) Safe Travels!Make the most of it
4
I went for dinner and was very pleased with the food. The yu Sheng is just excellent ... Crunchy. The marble gobi fish was also very good. Very fresh. My favourite was the dessert. The coconut jelly. Do try if you go there. Overall quite happy. However, waiters should be more careful when pouring the red wine. Some drops fell on my eating plate. For the price you pay you expect the service to be perfect
2
What is high-end Chinese dining:- many plate changes, diet sized portions of food, delicately sculptured pieces of chicken, tables spaced far apart, high prices. It's on the fifth floor of Paragon, dominated by red chandeliers and private rooms lining the walk to the main dining area. Overall, decent food, not memorable for me to rush back to order any one dish

It does help to have a local guide to get through the maze of options, the end result was a spectacular selection of tasty dishes that well complemented each other. I see from reviews that it used to be even better, pity I have not found it then :-) There are long queues outside for the opening, do book your table in advance. The dining hall is big and it fills up in minutes

Gone are the days when Crystal Jade produces good dim sum. Nowadays after the sale of Crystal Jade to LVMH's private equity arm L Capital Asia, the food standard keeps on falling. Although they revamped the menu with more new offerings but the standards are far from good. They are more focused on generating revenue nowadays, eg they start charging sgd4 for a small saucer plate of dried shrimp chilli when it was complimentary last time. Even the plate of roast pork looks pathetic and small. For those looking for good dim sum or Cantonese food, you are better off going to the Imperial Treasure group of restaurants. They maintain better standards and the food taste much much better.

Eaten here a few times in the past and had no issueFood is very good, tasty and qty is sufficientDecor is standard Chinese restaurant fare and prices are what you expect for a higher level of this popular chainWhat let us down during this particular visit, was not the service itself (the waitresses for pleasant and empathic), it was the length of time it took to actually bring any food outMy host is a vegetarian and we all agreed we would keep it simple and just eat veggie!Big mistake - it took almost an hour before the first dish came out - and the next batch only came out fifteen mins laterShame as I used to like this place - all it takes is one episode to lose a custome

Crystal Jade Golden Palace at Paragon is a modern restaurant; itâ€™s one of the most popular Chinese restaurant chains in Singapore with a sexy and dark tone. Crystal Jade Restaurant is a familiar name to locals and expats alike. Most Chinese restaurants are quite boring when it comes to the interior decor. Not Crystal Jade Golden Palace. It is definitely one of the most attractive Chinese restaurants that I've been to. Our favorite dishes here include the Steamed Bamboo Clams, Peking Duck, and its range of Chinese boiled soups. The Sweet & Sour Pork is also one of the best we have had in Singapore. Prices are certainly not cheap, and it is not a place for every day dining. However, for times when you are celebrating an important occasion with your family, Crystal Jade Golden Palace is worth the treat. The prices may be steep, but the high standard food, the friendly service makes a meal at Crystal Jade Golden Palace flagship outlet in Paragon so reasonable. For our expectation it was a worthwhile gratifying dinner

A good place to take oversea visitor for lunch. Elegant ambient and reasonable service. Easy to choose from a variety selection of Cantonese cuisine. BBQ pork, duck and chicken as appetizer is rich but light as the serving is small in size; something very pleasant.
5
Been here last week because a friend promised to take me out for dinner. Surprisingly, I feel in love with their dimsum and I will surely comeback and bring new set of friends
5
Really enjoyed it. True cantonese with careful preparation, excellent ingredients, thoughtful design and plating and a warm comfortable atmosphere.
I liked it so much we went back with another set of friends the next day.
5
I'm Chinese, but this restaurant re-invents chinese food to a new level of delicious! I've been eating chinese food all my life but the food never gets boring here. It's too good!
5
Had an awesome dining experience at this restaurant. Would recommend this place for those who are looking for authentic exquisite Chinese cuisine. A must-try are their dim-sums and stir-fried beef hor fun.

Love Dim Sum, with lovely company.
The restaurant is fantastic, the food to die for, and the service was wonderful.
Price, im not sure as my friend paid, Whhoooo.

Located at Bishan Junction near the MRT, its yum cha and duck rice are superb. The environment is clean and the staffs are friendly. Overall, the food is good at reasonable price

Saw good reviews on this place, went along and had a rubbish evening. Service was awful. Starters and mains arrived in the wrong order, then 2 dishes were forgotten. Waiter blamed a computer error, then 1 dish arrived and not the second. All side dishes and rice were by this time stone cold. Refused to pay service charge, this was honoured.
2
We book a table for 8 pax. Still had to wait for 30 mins. I dun understand why it's so poorly managed. Most of servers are senior people which is a problem in Singapore nowadays. They work hard but I dun feel the 'luxury' or 'class' from their service. Will I visit again? nope. There are so many choices out there. Overrated.

For an unrushed and peaceful meal, visit Crystal Jade Golden Palace on a weekday afternoon. On a weekend, the place is packed and difficult to get a seat without a reservation. And rightly so.They sat 10 of us at a table, and the service was excellent. 3 staff were there to make sure we were ok. During the meal, they changed plates and refilled our tea regularly. Crystal Jade also serves the best dimsum. Try the Xiao Long Bao - minced pork and broth wrapped in dim sum skin. Other places serve this with thick skin which makes this a doughy experience. But at Crystal Jade, the skin is very delicate so you taste more of the delicious filling.Their roast pork belly is a must try as well. At $9, you get 9 small squares, but it's the best roast pork I have ever tried. Crispy crackling tops quite lean and non-oily cuts, to be eaten with the mustard. This is an experience that should be savoured slowly.One surprise was the glutinous rice. I never order this, but thankfully my friend did. The rice isn't overly sticky or oily and it has a generous layer of minced meat. Superbly flavourful and I think I found my new favourite dish!If you still have space, order the Liu Sha Bao (Salted egg yolk custard bun). The filling can be hot so eat it carefully. For ten people, the bill came up to about $25/person, which I thought was great value for such excellent service and food

The food was really good. service was wonderful. the price is reasonable for the kind of restaurant. Highly recommended.

This is a very good restaurant serving quality Chinese food. There are a lot of differences between Chinese restaurants in the East compared to Western countries which can make ordering quite confusing. At Crystal Jade the staff were very patient and helpful in guiding us through the menu and making sensible recommendations for our order. What we got was spot on both in terms of how the dishes complimented each other and the quantity. I can thoroughly recommend the Peking Duck - delicious served 2 ways: crispy skin in pancakes plus the duck meat in noodles. This was especailly gratifying given our earlier very poor experience at Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck restaurant (see my review to find out why)

This review is for Crystal Jade Palace at Takashimaya. It's been quite some time since we visited Crysyal Jade Palace. This time, we were given a small room for our company of four - 2 adults and 2 children. It was good as it's quiet and the children was able to "walk around" in the room when they get restless. The ambience in the main hall is more happening but I prefer the peace in our room.The waitress (auntie) serving us was attentive to our needs and service was impeccable! Roasted Pork Belly is highly recommended... A small plate cost $13 but the pork skin was so crispy and the meat so tender that my daughter asked for more helpings than usual. Dim Sum such as Steamed prawn dumplings (Har Kau) and steamed dumpling with convoy and vegetables were excellent.. First time trying the steamed cuttlefish with garlic - the cuttlefish was tender and fresh and the sauce was tasty too! However, I find the steamed beancurd skin roll rather lacking in ingredients and size... Perhaps I have been pampered with the generous portions offered by Tim Ho Wan.There are also a wide selection of desserts and one will be spoilt for choice - from the usual herbal jelly to Snow appear with ginseng and honey as well as ice cream with glutinous rice and grass jelly. All in all, we spent about $120 for 2A and 2C. To be honest, I have not been particularly impressed with the Crystal jade outlets except for the one at Takashimaya and paragon. They have expanded too fast with so many outlets across the island. Quality and service are not consistent across the different outlets and dining concept.If you want authentic, Cantonese food with good service, then just hop down to the ones at paragon or Takashimaya and you won't be disappointed

This is a review of Crystal Jade Palace Restaurant at the upmarket Takashimaya Shopping Centre, surprisingly missing on TripAdvisor! This seemingly upmarket restaurant bustling with local clients serves authentic Singapore Chinese food at reasonable prices. The ever- smiling helpful staff are perfectly willing to deviate from the published menu to accommodate several mouth watering vegetarian dishes as well. The place's bustling activity only adds to the colour, not diminish the speedy & courteous service! No wonder one finds whole families partaking of the fare on offer with lots of children in attendance! An excellent choice if you're weary of shopping in busy Orchard Road
5
High-end Chinese restaurant located at Level 5 of the Paragon Shopping Centre. The ambience and decor are first-rate. Service is unfailingly efficient and friendly. We found the food tasty and well-presented, from Peking Duck to the humble Dim Sum dishes. Prices are high but not unreasonable for such a classy restaurant. And we could bring our own wine to enjoy with our dinner, without having to pay any corkage fee (for first 2 bottles)

This review is about Crystal Jade Pristine at Scotts Square. Over a year after this restaurant is open, I don't understand why it still hasn't been listed on TripAdvisor, and neither the company nor the site seems bothered about it. A very different concept from the other CJ outlets, this one is in a quiet and subdued, elegant surrounding. They serve simple dishes with healthy ingredients. Quite refined, but like most healthy dining options, of course it's not exciting and full of flavour like say Szechuan cuisine. Pristine replaces a short-lived Crystal Jade Kitchen, which used to serve a delicious dish called QQ Rice (a mixture of fragrant and glutinous rice topped with scallion and ginger paste - simple but scrumptious!) As with the last incarnation, this one doesn't attract many customers. Hope it lasts, because it does offer an interesting eating alternative
5
We came here with our daughter and absolutely loved this place. This must be one of the top chinese restaurants in Singapore without a doubt. It can be pricey, but I don't think you would be disappointed. So if you are willing to pay top dollar, don't miss out come and enjoy diner and experience you food, not just eat it

This very conveniently located Eatery on the top floor of the Paragon Mall on Orchard road is a consistent favorite with friends and family …… The Chicken Corn soup and the Hot & Sour Seafood soup are the best I have had anywhere !!! Wasabi Prawns are also very good, The Sliced Black Pepper beef also a hot favorite , The chicken with cashew nuts another great choice, The crispy Noodles with seafood are my personal favorite dish at this eatery!!! The Peking Duck with pancakes and hoison sauce is also very very good but tends to run out sometimes so go early or book it in advance …… the vegetable fried rice is a house special and the Kailan with oyster sauce is my recommendation from the selection of veg offerings!!! This place has something for everyone as the kids love the soup and the duck and there is a great variety of offerings for the more refined palate!!

We bought our parents from both sides for a lunch get together at Crystal Jade G.P & we had a wonderful time. We had yum cha which was reasonable priced & pretty good. The food was served promptly & the customer service was wonderful. They were always attentive and efficient. We loved the interior decoration - very romantic & classy. We will definitely return

Hi the restaurant is nice and modern, the service was fast and very good. They take care of my 2 kids in the restaurant.The dim sun were very good, and lot of choice; I strongly recommend, there are always better dim sun...but these ones were goodThe fresh apple juice was good also. The fried rice with chicken is expensive 20 boxes and not terrific.You can even eat alone at the bar..very modern, or 2 folksThe only thing is when you get in the restaurant the Welcome from the lady was not nice and I felt that I was queueing in a airport...be nicer and don t judge peopl

I was treated to dinner at the Crystal Jade on the occasion of my wife's birthday. Generally speaking, the food was good but it was very expensive - indeed, overpriced. The prawns coated in spice but then served in their shells were very unpleasant. The service was a mixture of the coldly professional and the absurdly incompetent. The first dish arrived about 5 minutes in advance of everything else. A waitress then tried to snatch a plate from me as I was eating up and she then hovered over me so that she could grab it at the first available opportunity. Beers that we ordered (in tins - the choice was very limited) failed to arrive until we renewed the order and (although these things do happen) there was no apology. The lowlight, however, was when a different waitress actualy physically wrested the serving implements out of my hand as I was taking food from a dish in the middle of the table and then proceeded to serve everybody else (even though nobody else wanted anything) before she let me have them back. I found that little short of astonishing. Another problem was that it was very chilly in the restaurant and people at the next table had to ask for blankets. The restaurant does not have control of the air conditioning in the shopping centre, so it was not their fault - but it was cold nonetheless! Finally, I suffered from an upset tummy during the night and the next day, although to be fair five of us ate the same food and I was the only one to suffer - a rogue prawn perhaps

Paragon is a child friendly mall and the restaurant is right next to an indoor playground. In hindsight that was probably why the restaurant was so sensitive to the little guests' needs. The restaurant itself was very elegantly decorated - chandeliers and such. In spite of that the staff was very friendly and professional. Without blinking an eye they put us - including two cranky kids - to a corner table that was spacious, with good view and relative privacy.The food was of high standard. The suckling pig bun was a bit on the small side, but the Teo chow cold dish was great. The 5- year old loved the recommended pan fried cod fish, and the steam meat loaf was nicely presented. Overall the place was not cheap - it came to S$180 for two adults and two small kids. Still, it was well worth the money to be able to have an elegant good meal with kids
5
Have been here several times for lunch and dinner but never wrote a review. Any dish is excellent, as is the service and the ambiance. Chinese Food with a twist, good choice of wines and excellent main and dessert menu. Our favourites would be Crispy Chicken with Mango (Appetizer), Asparagus with Black fungus and Chinese Yam, Steamed Fish, the soups, the desserts. Peking duck also very good.Suitable for any time of the day. Solo, for couples, with friends or family. Reasonably priced. Reservation for peak hours recommended
4
We dined here with some business friends for dinner last night. We had the set menu for 4 people, though eventually we had 5 people. The extra person was only an additional $77 though. The set menu came with sharks fin, and cod fish. The brown rice was also quite special. I can't take wine, so changed the red wine fruit dessert to jelly with mango sago. My mom said that the red wine was really strong in the dessert. The set menu for 4 people was quite filling though

I wish restaurants like this exist in the UK. I'd consider this a fine dining place but they are very child-friendly. We took our toddler and did not feel out of place at all. The staff were very accommodating and they even had an area by the bar where you can park your buggies. A special mention should go to the gentleman who took our order (I did not remember his name..). He guided us through their extensive menu and advised us what dishes would go with our choices. Unlike many other restaurants, he advised us not to order too much - we were glad that he did as the portions were big! We had the Peking duck, which was one of the best that I have tasted so far. We also had steamed live Green Wrasse...I have never heard of this type of fish before but decided to try it on the server's recommendation, and am I glad we did! The fish was tender, soft, melt-in-your-mouth and the sauce was very delicate - complemented the fish perfectly! We also had their seasonal vegetable, pea shoot in garlic sauce which was delicious and a few items from their dim sum menu. Their char siu puffs were otustanding! It was an expensive meal bu the quality of the food and service made this one of the most memorable meals I've had in a long while. Would definitely come back for special occasions

We had dim sum for lunch today.Their signature steamed pork dumpling with whole mini abalone is very good.The texture of the abalone was excellent. In fact, we had 1 order for each of us.The roast pork knuckle slices wrapped around cucumber baton is unique and very good.The steamed rice flour roll with beef slices was very good.The rice roll was silky.The deep fried dough fritter stuffed with prawn paste eas done very well . Crispy and non-oily.The baked egg tart with birds' nest was very good . Other standard dishes are good. A very pleasant experience. Must try.Will revisit.

After our grandchildren had a nice play in the childrens' amusement area (just outside the Crystal Jade - Paragon SC) our son and his wife invited us to lunch at this restaurant.The restaurant is very spacious and elegent. The decor is very warm with a lot of attention to detail.There are lots of areas where little diners can eat at their own pace and not disturb other customers. Service was very attentive which is a plus when little diners have requests.We were there for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was almost full. It has a great menu with lots of choices. Food was tasty and it was served in large portions. The Chinese tea was served in great tea pots!!Try this place you should not be disappointed with the quality of the Chinese food

We ate at the Crystal Jade in the Paragon shopping centre on the first night of our Singapore stay. The food was delicious - we had soup as a starter (me the spinach, OH the hot and sour) and then shared 2 mains and a veggie dish. This was more than enough for us (though we were tired and not overly hungry). I forget one main, but the salted egg yolk prawns were absolutely divine. Price was fairly reasonable for Singapore we thought, but we did select carefully from the menu as otherwise it could have ended up very pricey. The ambience was lovely, very smart and quiet. Service was speedy and certainly polite - but could certainly have been friendlier
3
I almost left before eating. I went there for lunch. I asked for a table for one and before I could finish my sentence, the lady allotting the tables looked right through me at two people behind me, who had walked in after me (also without a reservation) and attended to them first.Having planned to try this restaurant, I decided to go in anyway.The menu was elaborate and fancy with a lot of interesting dishes. I tried the Barbecued pork with honey, sautÃ©ed chicken fillet with cashew nut, and the Peking duck.The food was good though I expected better. The service, other than the the entry episode was pleasant.The deep fried Quail with salt and pepper looked interesting but I'd had too much to eat already
5
We ate here in the summer of last year, and what an amazing meal we had!As a group of three, we ordered a whole Peking duck which proved the perfect size for our group. The duck was cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce was some of the best I've experienced in my travels across Asia. All in all the duck was incredible, and we also ordered some dim sum as a starter which were equally as good. The service was excellent and the ambience welcoming and very stylish.Amazing meal
4
Ambience is superb, especially good for bringing business and family guests. Food is good quality, but slightly overpriced. Staff can be even sharper in their service. Overall good dining experience, thank you!
4
Had a business lunch there and enjoyed the egg white with birds nest as well as the sweet and sour kurobuta. Quite disappointing though as did not get to taste the real taste of the pork.
4
Yummy dim sim, try the appetizers as well. Service was professional and fast. Prices were much higher though especially in the land of the hawkers. However I still regard it as an excellent place to wine and dine friends and business partners.
3
I have been to this restaurant twice and both times, the food was average. It was not memorable yet passable for an average Chinese restaurant. However, service was good and the interiors were classy. Prices were slightly on a higher side, but I guess you are paying for the ambience
3
We went there at lunchtime for dim sum and the food was average without really being exciting. I have had a lot better dim sum meals. The service was excellent and the staff was very helpful and made some good suggestions. I judge a dim sum by their pork buns and they were good without being memorable. It is a long way up there in the building and lift was very slow in coming. I hope that I can find better in Singapore next time. For three people the cost was $63 SIN. The Chines tea was not cheap, but quite good. Tacking on a very small plate of pickles which we did not ask for and then putting it on the bill was not that good. The steamed sweet potato dumpling was very nice
5
We managed to squeeze in at 10pm! All retuarants close on dot at 11 hence very reluctant to take in customers after their set timings. We however managed and were their last customers. Staff friendly and nice... Food was good and in huge portions. The wine by the glass excellent
3
I am a huge fan of Crystal Jade Golden Palace at Paragon mall , Bangkok, Thailand. When I had a chance to visit Singapore. My goal was to try the original Crystal Jade. I visited this restaurant with such high expectation and was well disappointed. The dim sum dishes were not that impression. Everything was just an average. The one in Bangkok is much better in everything - food, decoration, and service. I wouldn't go back to this place
4
Ambience: Nice dark decor, with faux lamps. Its very different from your usual crystal jade with a touch of class. Food: Dim sum on the weekends. Its cost a bit more than the usual crystal jade. You won't go wrong with the fried prawn roll with beancurd, the congee, beef stew, har gao,...Add a lovely pot of tea in a lovely pot. You can easily enjoy a few hours away
4
I went there with my family to savor their beggar chicken, which required advance order.The ambience is great, classy and very well decorated with chandeliers. We were given a nice corner as we brought along our baby and a stroller. We have made this request earlier during reservation.The gentleman serving us is Ken, who is always polite and smiley. Business is good taking into consideration its a Wednesday (Boxing Day).As the beggar chicken is meant for 8 to 10 adults, we ordered some dim sum to complement the dish.The beggar chicken turned out to be a huge disappointment. To those who are thinking of trying this,you might need to set your expectation. The chicken was not totally cooked. It is huge and the inner part was not cooked and some parts even abit bloody. The filings are just some mix of vegetables and nothing spectacular. The taste is quite blend. Even after Ken returned with the re-cooked chicken, it doesn't improve our appetite. Ken was apologetic and explained that this $98 Beggar Chicken promotion is relatively new and probably accounts for the not-so-well cooked chicken. He compensated us with 2 free dishes of desserts.We don't deny this is a great and classy place for dining and special celebrations. For us, overall food is slightly more pricey (of course as we are also paying for their great ambience and service) but their Beggar Chicken is a huge disappointment
4
I ad dinner at he Crystal Jade with some friends in Singapore on a recent visit. I've eaten in a lot of Crystal Jades over the years and this was by far the best. I can't understand the huge variations in ratings of this restaurant as I thought it was really excellent. We had a range of dishes starting with soup all the way through to dessert.All the dishes were good but the fried marble goby was outstanding
4
Service was very nice, but tables were uncomfortable with nowhere to put your legs.
Food through made up for it.
This is a chain so maybe the seats are better elsewhere. We had duck, a spicy beef, scallops and rice and it was very reasonable
4
The place is elegant and the food is exquisite, that mean expensive.
But really, the food is very well done and presentation is really nice, the service staff are nice to a fault.
5
Only the best and fresh ingredients! On the pricey end but definitely worth it! We had chili crab, steamed fish, braised mushrooms, noodles. Everything tasted so good! We literally finished every bit!
4
A very popular place for lunch, Food is excellent, particularly the dim sum. Unfortunately this is also a very popular restaurant and often have to queue for a table. Service is good, price reasonable. Good ambient too...
5
Just go and try it, that's all I'm going to say! the room to the right side with the curved ceiling is a nice place to dine too.
3
This stalwart of chinese food on orchard road has been around for 8 years or so and i've been here more than 10 times, but this is my first review for golden palace i believe. As we were there for lunch, a sensible and tasty option would be their dim sum. We ordered the chicken feet, BBQ pork buns and pastry, the crystal dumplings, custard buns with egg yolk which were quite tasty. Don't order their "QQ" range of sweet buns which came with panda and mouse faces, they look better than they taste. We ordered the carrot cake too which never arrived so their service has turned slightly spotty over the years. We didn't order the boring usual siew mai, ha gao and xiao long bao. Overall, an ok place to eat if you are in the area and not too fussy. There are better places for dim sum and chinese food, and then again, there are worse places to
4
Been told to try Crystal Jade Restaurant by a number of locals and decided to give it a try. Overall did not disappoint.Food:We ordered several dim sum dishes on top of regular items on the menu to get a sample of Crystal Jade. The dim sum - we had char siew bao (BBQ pork buns), siew mai (pork dumplings), har kau (shrimp dumplings) and xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) - were OK. I personally felt there were better ones out there for less the price. From what I read from earlier reviews, seems like the quality may have come down in recent years. We also ordered ther fried hor fun with beef, steamed seafood vermicelli cooked in chinese wine, fried stuffed tofu with shrimp, and BBQ pork. We thought these were excellent. The quality of ingredients, the execution and presentation is top notch and worth the price considering the environment and location.Service:Very attentive. The waiting staff is trained to tell if the customers prefered to be left alone or are open to receiving attention. We were there as a family with an infant and the staff gave us lots of attention which we did not mind. However I have also noticed that there were couples perhaps on a date and they were given their own personal space except when there is a need to fill up the tea cups.Environment:Its OK...decor looks tired but we appreciate that tables are not squeezed together like sardines. You could have a proper conversation in this place.Overall recommendation:Crystal Jade is decent. It is a bit pricey but we were not rush and sat for a nice leisure meal which lasted around 2 hours. We appreciated that and for the quality, we would return

Been quite a long time since we visited this long-time Crystal Jade branch, the highest and priciest within the chaiin. Inside decor and excellent service remains the same,,,Food-wise, we ordered the following;1) Shark bone soup and fish maw soup,,,,the shark bone soup was clearly superior to the fish maw soup,,,,the milky white murky shark bone was well-bodied whereas the fish maw tasted clear but ordinary,,,,2)Fish with bean sauce,,,fish was firm but the flour mix made it a bit sticky and soggy, nice taste but wrong texture,,,3) The fried rice was a complete letdown,,,,the art of eating fried rice in a nice upscale restaurant vs cooking at home was the requirement and expectation that the rice be stir-fried and tossed to a heavenly dry-ness not achievable with the domestic home kitchen,,,with the accompanying wok-hei. Alas, the Crystal Jade fried rice was soggy and a bit bland and tasteless,,,,4) The stirfired beef with 3 mushrooms was the champion,,,the mushrooms were fresh, firm and succulent and the beef was soft and robust taste,,,,,5) We also ordered a few dim sum (chicken feet, carrot cake, 3 musrhooms springroll) which was okay and the only unique one was the radish with rice-roll and pork floss. It came with a dip and the combination of glutinous rice covering, crunchy radish, the saltish sauce etc, yummy,,,totally enjoyable.We always had the expectation that Crystal Jade was able to retain its commanding lead amongst the other Chinese dining chains because of its ability to consistently deliver amongst all its outlets but somehow, at this premier outlet, food standard has became almost complacent,,,, and for that, we paid 200 (without any fish or peking duck, which we consider to be on the unusual high side).And it is freezing cold inside despite temperatures at 35 degrees outside, a lot of diners were rubbing their hands and those in the know, were all wearing sweaters,,,Perhaps it is to do with the efforts of the management to make patrons stick to the 11am, 1215pm and 130pm sittings on the weekend,,,,no one would stay long in North Pole to chit-chat,,,

family friendly dining plc, my kid loves it. Soup is tasty, generally the dishes r not salty nor oily hence provides rather healthy meal for kids n old folks. beside, the cooks are flexible with orders outside their menu list, they are able to dish out delicious vegetarian dishes as well
1
Wow this place was quite an experience. It was very large and very busy and freezing cold. I asked the waitress if they could lower the air conditioning and she did not seem to understand me.I eat a lot of chinese food but this was like nothing I had seen before. Lots of very strange dishes which tasted horrible.It was also very expensive. I do not recommend this place unless maybe you are a native
3
Avg Chinese food, yet charged you an arm and a leg... the food basically is in small serving but priced very high
3
The ambiance is exquisitely Chinese. Nothing like Hong Kong. Food is as good as any of their other branches.
4
Their private dining space is good - we were a group of 20 and had a lot of privacy to make noise and have some fun! :)
Good food - they customized and accommodated my dietary needs (with some difficulty!)
4
Enjoyed it. Good food well done. Had crispy pork belly..terrific, whole fish very good and asparagus and scallops was superb.
4
Interesting dishes, only worthwhile if entertaining.
4
Food is authentic, but people who waited looked irritated as if they were not paid their salary. The Floor Manager was bad. Food was good but in small portions. Meal for 2 costed us SG$90. There are better local restaurants around near orchard road.
4
Over the past six years, we have been back pretty much monthly to the dim sum lunch at the Crystal Jade Golden Palace in Paragon. In our opinion this is one of the best dim sum places in Singapore. We always book a table in the main hall as there is otherwise a risk of being shown into a rather scruffy back room. Price levels are reasonable and having 7 dim sum plates for two people plus tea usually comes in at just under SGD 50 in total.We have also visited the restaurant a few times in the evening. Price levels are much higher during the dinner service and the food good but not outstanding
2
I've been here for attending our friend birthday. We are about 20 peoples booked a private room for dinning.Yeah, as per subject, we need to wait 2 hours until our menu reserved... Ooohh dear, if that was not my friend's birhtday i think i will get out of there...But i must admit that the food is delicious... We like it.
2
My daughter and myself decided to try this restaurant for lunch, and had an underwhelming experience. Our table was in the mirrored back room, not the much nicer main dining room. It was not a busy time, so not sure why we were placed where several large families with children were parked. We were both wearing dresses. Absolutely no help with neither the dim sum menu nor the regular menu. The food was okay, prices were okay, but the service was nonexistent. Had we had more help with the menu, tea cups refilled, etc. we might have had a more enjoyable experience
2
We ate here after being on the road for over a month and in need of someone to "wait" on us. So we tried to choose something with a solid reputation and reliable food.Having dined at Lau Pa Sat Festival Market the night before for less than $40 between the two of us (this included six kinds of dim sum which were fantastic, chicken satay, green beans with chilli and four beers), we were ready to be wowed for $100SGD+.It was sooo dissappointing!! The wait staff were surly, the menu convoluted, the room where we sat was lit with ultra-flourescent lights and there was a corporate function in the private room next door so there was very loud, wailing karaoke wafting in. Not the special expensive meal were hoping for.Ambience gets a zero. Service gets a zero. Food gets an 7 though. The peking duck was lovely (not better than any I have had in Melbourne however) but the way they cooked the meat of the remaining duck (after using the skin for the pancakes) was out of this world - one of the best duck dishes I have ever had anywhere. Was simply stir fried in their ginger sauce...really beautiful.It is a shame about the service, for the first time in my life I felt completely uninspired to leave a tip. And I got a "tut tut tut" noise made by the waitress for it!! Simple fact is that it is sooo easy to eat well in Singapore, don't bother with this place - head to the Hawker markets (or even Food Republic) instead and use your money to head to one of the rooftop bars and enjoy an expensive cocktail instead!

Recently tried this restaurant for the first time. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meal and the value for money. We were entertaining an elderly relative (90 years old!) and she enjoyed the meal too.
A good example of a well run chain.

Great Dimsum.
Ask for the Dimsum Menu, the selection is more Affordable and the Selection is great.
Everything is good.

We went to the Crystral Jade restaurant for a Dim Sum lunch. It was very well priced and great food. Will go again.

As a first time tourist in Singapore we visited Crystal Jade at lunchtime for Dim Sum and thought the decor, food and value were fantastic. We immediately re-booked for a romantic Valentine dinner. On arrival we were not shown into the classy restaurant but were taken down a corridor to a huge, drab 'barn-like' room with no atmosphere and worse still a room in a dirty condition -- totally unfit for a top restaurant. There was clear evidence of food smeared on mirrored panels next to our table (perhaps by another unhappy customer ?) Perhaps we should have thrown a big tantrum and demanded to be moved - but we were tired and jet lagged and didn't want a fuss. We ordered the minimum amount of food, ate it in misery and left as soon as possible. We would never go back if this is how they treat tourists

This is definitely one of the top chinese restaurants in Singapore without a doubt. Though agreeably, it is and can be pricey depending on what you order. But you're willing to pay top dollar, this is what you can expect. The restaurant offers private dining and is well-known for its Chinese cuisine

Ok, this review is for all you folks who dub yourselves as true "foodies" and are always on the lookout for "knock your socks off" food gems. My husband and I have eaten some pretty amazing food all over the globe and were thrilled to both agree this restaurant has the best dumplings we've ever had. No question, this restaurant is the real deal....it's food is authentic, quality and has lots of flavor (I emphasis the flavor as most of you foodies know that most often the biggest thing lacking in a dish is the blow you away flavor ;) This place is inside a mall (don't let that deter you....trust me....it's top notch). There will be about a 20 minute wait as it's a super popular place that has won many awards for it's dim sum and dishes. Here's what we had: dumplings in chili sauce (our ABSOLUTE favorite....you will be in food heaven with this one), steamed pork dumplings (also simply amazing), long beans with minced pork (a total flavor explosion), sauteed eel and chive shoots (amazing flavor and texture) and the steamed veggie dumplings (really good but not as amazing as the dumplings in chili sauce). If you're looking for authentic, outstanding Chinese look no further....this restaurant will not disappoint! Bon Appetite

One of the top chinese restaurants in Singapore, their signature dishes include the roast pork, duck, promfret, sharkfins, dimsum, and my favorite dessert, ohrnee(taro with ginko). the location is well, in Orchard road Paragon (ask anyone around, everyone knows this place). The sad point is, well, the delicious meal does not come cheap, so be prepared to burn a hole in your pocket for the best chinese food

My Singaporean colleague took me here for a dim sum luncheon it was wonderful, the array of dim sums where very good and also the Chinese tea selection.I recommend Crystal Jade for who loves dim sum and since I have to be back to Singapore often, I will definitely drop in oftenWell done

During our 12 days in Singapore in 2008 we enjoyed dinner at this local gem. We were with our daughter in law's family and they ordered in Chinese. Everything was delicious especially the porridge of rice and meat. Yum! Didn't wait long for a table but we went early. Located in one of the big malls

I first had this in Singapore and I liked it so whenever I go to singapore I would dine there. They have a varietty of delicious chinese cuisine especially the bean curd with sea food..... Now I learned that there's one in Bangkok at the Paragon and it's as good as the one in Singapore so in term of an authentic chinese food, I think it's one of the restaurant that comes in my mind when thinking of the chinese. However they donot serve everything all in one. Things come one by one so if you order a rice. It comes the latest! I surely would go back again

The place was fully booked but nevertheless the service was efficient and friendly.
We had excellent Peking Duck, and also the Seafood soup in the Melon was
of first quality. Price is appropriate for the qualitiy and the setting up.
4
we had a busy Sunday Dim Sum on Mothers Day. The staff was very efficient and the food was quick and fresh.
5
We've eaten there four or fives times as we pass through Singapore and have never been dispapointed by the range and quality of the food and its presentation and service.

The ambience complements the food. For casual dining, visit the lower end versions of Crystal Jade.

Great food but a little pricey. Alternative: Crystal Jade kitchen for more value

service level is lacking

Great ambience, great service! My fav dish there is actually the Pekking Duck! It is unique and different from the rest that I've tried. Even their sweet & sour fish is unforgetable!

Nice outlet...

always a solid place to go for affordable, yummy Chinese food

The best pepper crab I ever ate in my life. The service was a bit rushed though. Very popular so you must reserve.
4
Decent food and decent price, what more can you ask for? And it's at Orchard Road.

so -so

Good ambience with a unique look comparing to most chinese authentic food restaurants. Cutleries also compliment well with the environment. Food quality is the same as jade palace in takashimaya. Pricing wise is still cheaper than palace
5
Their dim sum is the best so far on the island of Singapore. Price acceptable, food presentation and taste are great.

Tis one of my fave Chinese Restos...there are quite a few of em; Centerpoint, GWC, Taka...i love the Sauteed Beef with Kailan, Battered Prawns, ohhh nohh!

One of the better Chinese restaurants in Singapore - you can't go wrong here. Dim sum is ridiculously popular - don't even think about showing up on weekends without reservations.
4
as usual ...never fail to dissappoint me
4
oooh.. truly fantastic fine dining.. love the dark interiors and soups!!

I had my congee custom-made and service was impeccable.

Food only comes in 1 standard portion size. Seats are too close to each other and the wait staff always get the orders wrong. It used to be my favourite Chinese restaurant but not anymore.
4
Just as tasty and cheap the Camy Dumpling Restaurant in Melbourne, but super classy to boot. Not that that makes it better than Camy :)
4
Nice environment, I like the standard of the food, especially the dim sum
