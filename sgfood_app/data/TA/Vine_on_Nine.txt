After reading about Vine on Nine in the Expat Living magazine March edition we thought that we would try this spot out. First impressions were good although the place was empty (Tuesday night around 8pm). We were served promptly and the staff were friendly enough. We ordered a glass of the Shearwater S/Blc $13 and a Little Creatures Beer $12 and both arrived really chilled which was important as we chose to sit outside.We ordered the Beef Lasagne and Spaghetti Aglio Olio (both around the $15 mark). The lasagne was great - healthy portion size, loads of cheese and it arrived straight from the oven. The same cannot be said for the Aglio Olio. While it looked good, it was the size of a starter. When we spoke to the waitress about this she advised that this was the standard size and that there was nothing she could do. In the end, we ended up sending the dish back as the size did not justify the price at all (actually pretty cheeky and the usual indifference you get from so many restaurants in Singapore if you complain).The rest of the evening went well and the vibe picked up a bit as a few more patrons arrived. Word of warning the final bill arrived around 22h15 and they were pretty keen to get the place closed up for the night by this time.Overall a fairly good midweek night out. The question is would we go back? Jury is out on that one given the number of eataries up and down the length of (Upper) East Coast Road that still need trying and the fact that it wasn't just around the corner from us. Probably leaning more towards yes than no
