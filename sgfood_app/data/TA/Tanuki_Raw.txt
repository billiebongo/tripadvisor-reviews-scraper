Love the food here - every dish is well-thought of. Lunch is extremely value-for-money, and my family had a great time as always.
5
I loved the tanuki kaisen don which I felt the various sashimi were pretty fresh! Oysters and truffle sweet potato fries were yummy as well. Great date spot with interesting drinks!
5
We ordered two dons (the truffle gyudon and unagi hotate don) and they were both amazing. Another favourite of ours would be the foie gras donut.
3
Friendly staff and prompt service. Food is OK only. Surrounding is too noisy during lunch hour.. Too crowded
4
Good quality food and reasonable price. Ordered 12 pieces of oyster at half price due to happy hour. Service staff was very attentive. Inner restaurant ambience is better. Unfortunately we were seated at the entrance area.
5
We ordered the bara chirashi and beef yakiniku , both very yummy and the ingredients are fresh and tasty.
3
Food choices here are more than the Kapok outlet, but more crowded. Food quality is still good, only fried salmon seaweed is too hard to bite, need to work on that dish. Was sitted at the table next to the automatic sliding door to the outdoor seatings, HORRIBLE seat!!!!! Whenever the crew serves dishes or guests walk through the door, it opens and the strong gust of wind can literally blow a pair of chopsticks flying away! Imagine those dust it sends onto my food, hair blown all messy, food turns cold like immediately. The management needs to do something about this, meanwhile, advice to REQUEST to be seated away from that sliding door

We were looking for a break from shopping on Orchard Road, so we stopped by this restaurant to get some snack and drink. The salmon sashimi was average but the garlic miso edamame was good. The drink was decent although the price was a bit high

Since sumiya closed we decided to look for another place for chirashi. Tanuki raw ! We dropped by for lunch on friday . We did not have any reservations but as it was after 2, there were tables..close to the entrance.We ordered the signature tanuki kaisen chirashi bowl . Water is complimentary and is placed on the table. But there is a lunch offer.. for 2$ you can add hot/ cold green tea, salad and miso soup.We ate all the rice and chirashi.. it was so delicious and fresh. Nice pickled ginger too. We were seated, served and satisfied.. very promptlyWe liked it so much..We went there the following sat and made reservations and was seated in in the middle of the restuarant. Definitely better seating inside.Anyway, we had two yakiniku bowls..one with foie gras and truffle, the tanuki chirashi bowl and truffle sweet potato fries I was not disappointed with the bara chirashi but found the beef tough. I would not order that again, not our preference. The sweet potato fries were good..but hardly tasted any truffle.Tanuki raw serves good quality fresh chirashi. Worth a visit

There are many choices for Japanese grub in Singapore and at different price levels. Having heard of Tanuki Raw and never really stepped in there, we decided to give it a go.Ordered the Salmon Kaisen and it was delicious. The mixed rice base and the various salmon parts made it tasty. Given that the space is rather limited, the seats are close. Then again, real estate prices in Singapore border on the ridiculous.....so that is to be expected. But the availability of balcony space allows the extra breathing space and view if you so require it
4
Good crowd during weekends however service is well maintained by the staff. Food was okay and Worth trying.
4
We had a few gatherings there a few times. We basically tried almost most of the dishes there. The salted egg yolk duck is really my least favourite. It can be quite warm in the restaurant (maybe cause its always crowded).
4
Other than the foie gras, we enjoyed the rest of the food other. The portion is just nice for a pax. Ambience is casually nice as well.
5
Expect to queue during dinner on weekends . But it's usually quite fast :) average spending per person with drinks , salmon , oysters is about $50ish . Value for money !
3
Localized Japanese food, not really authentic taste but still yummy. Pricey because of the location.
クオリティの割に高い印象。OC4階のテラス席は心地よい。
4
We were in the mall and noticed they had a happy hour with $2 oysters and decided to check them out. We enjoyed their well-mixed cocktails (the apple martini type one in particular) and the oysters were fresh. They have both indoor and outdoor seating to choose from. The outdoor patio is a nice spot to hang out, unless it gets tooo humid. We didn't check out their dinner menu since we already had reservations somewhere else but the restaurant was busy with diners as the evening went on
4
first time visiting and it's a popular place. ordered a Bara Chirashi don and I thought it's rather delicious. not exactly cheap but the serving of the sashimi is good. we had salted egg duck rice too, interesting mix but the meat is a little dry.go during happy hour, you get an interesting happy hour selection of more than the usual beer.Nordic feel.. quite a good place for gathering with friends
1
Had a reservation for 4 at 2pm. Arrived by 2.05pm (their reservation form mentions that they'll hold the table for 15min) but no table was available. Had to wait additional 20 mins for a table. I was at the front of the queue when there was a pair of customer making payment. The (I assume) RM (guy wearing checkered shirt) was attending to them. Another pair later then came to make payment. Instead of arranging for a staff to assist with the growing queue / attending to customers in the order of arrival, he went on the attend to the 2nd pair of customers making payment. Worst of all, after the 2nd pair of customers, the RM walked away without even attending to me or a single word. Thankfully, an attentive waitress was nearby, came over and attended to me and those in the queue. She then found out that no tables were available and apologized to my friends and I. All these while, the RM was no where to be seen near the entrance.Table location was bad as it was right beside a sliding glass door. No common sense was applied in putting the table beside it as the sliding door would come into contact with table items or any bags on the floor. We had to move the tables to avoid contact with the glass door.The food came in batches based on the largest set of food items the kitchen was receiving and decided to cook first. Our mains came before the salad and miso soup. One of our sides came after everything else was served. The serving tray one of the waitress used was so worn out and the plastic coating was peeling badly.Food was below average for the price.The peas inside the spicy miso edamame was pretty much devoid of taste. Amazing how they managed that.Too much rice in my foie gras yakiniku don that didn't balance the amount of foie gras and beef slices. Rice was bearing on the cold side.I also had the grapefruit tonic which was bad.The salad had too much sauce that was dripping over the table when picked up
2
First time here. Service was fine. Ordered the foie gras, eel and scallop rice bowl. I've eaten lunch out a lot since I started working 20 years ago but this is the first time I've had rubber eel. The skin of the unagi served was inedible with a thick gluey texture. The flesh was dense and reminded me of overcooked chicken. I wondered if it was eel or some other sea creature. The rest of the dishes were fine given that it is not fine dining. I would probably not go back. There are so many restaurant choices out there.
3
Went for dinner to try out this place since it's one of the Jap places I haven't gone to for a casual dinner. Ordered the Truffle yakiniku don, Tanuki kaison don and instagram this maki.Truffle yakiniku don- This dish had an onsen tamago, beef slices and the normal teriyaki-ish sauce over their rice with some japanese seasoning mix. What I hope for would be more flavourful beef because the sauce wasn't able to deliver on that especially once the yolk was mixed.Tanuki Kaison don- Sashimi slices that were cut not so nicely as though it were trimmings. Negitoro was probably kept for awhile, the colour has changed to a dark dull not even red or pink almost looks like uncooked minced pork seasoned with some dark soya sauce. Julienned daikon was really bitter. Instagram This Maki- Though did not look that neat, it's the only dish that was okay this dinner. Was still crispy and portion size was quite large. Service was very monotonous staff didn't really bother, just place your orders, pay and leave kind of attitude
4
First time trying Tanuki Raw! Very value for money and sizable portion! We ordered beef and salmon bowl and their WHAM fries. Not bad! Would come back again next time :)
5
Went there with my family to introduce them yo the Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku. It costs $23 but definitely worth it for its price, really filling bowl with tender short ribs and flavorful rice. You need to try it!
1
Food - went for the famed Chirashi, tried both the signature and Bara Chiraishi. In short, it was unsatisfactory. Some sashimi was fresh, most was not, leaving it with an unpleasant eating experience. Rice seasoning was decent but not consistently seasoned. Service was average, turnover is slow and the queue was long.Perhaps I can accept the above if I were eating at a budget Japanese restaurant, but the price is about $30/pax.I would not recommend this, nor would I return

Was at Tanuki Raw at Orchard Central for lunch.   Had the most ridiculously outrageous service experience ever.  We placed our order for two bowls of FOIE GRAS TRUFFLE YAKINIKU w/ FRESH TRUFFLE.  Not only did it take about 25 minutes to come at a time when there were very few orders (I could tell, since I was seated near the serving point and could see how many order chits were still up on the clip against the wall), one of the bowls did not have any foie gras inside.  I stirred the rice and flipped under the beef, thinking it might be buried deep inside, but no, there wasn't any foie gras.  I called over a food attendant, who then turned to another called Axle/Axel.  When he came over to check in with us, what he said simply smacked of uncalled for rudeness.  He asked me to check again, which I did, and insisted that there was foie gras sauce inside, that he delivered the dish himself, and that there should have been a piece of foie gras inside.  I told him that I checked carefully, and that I couldn't find it. Neither could he, and he then proceeded to say that I could have eaten it already.  Pointing to the bowl, I indicated that I had not even eaten, and that I would most certainly not want to waste time arguing or lying over a missing piece of foie gras.  All he responded was that it couldn't have been missing, since he delivered the dish himself.  WIth that, he walked away abruptly without telling me what recourse could be offered to this situation, and without checking with the kitchen behind me.  After about half an hour, when my friend and I finally finished our meal, we asked for the bill.  At that point, he mentioned that the kitchen was already making preparing a piece of foie gras for me.  I asked why he did not tell me about this earlier, and waited till both my friend and I had finished out meal.  He did not have any good response.I was hoping to enjoy the famed dishes of Tanuki, but ended up with a destroyed lunch, with my meal missing the signature ingredient, and with insinuations that I lied to the waiter so that I could get an extra piece of foie gras.  This is really uncalled for from a restaurant situated in Orchard Road, and surely has sealed my decision never to come again to be derided nor scorned at.

The quality and quantity of the salmon kaisen bowl did not disappoint. Salmon was creatively prepared in four ways without losing the freshness. The signature mixed rice peppered with sesame was equally tasty.  The rice bowl is priced at $12.90, with an option to include miso soup, salad and green tea for an additional $2
4
Arrived there around about 12.40pm or so. There were only about 2 couples or 4 frenz in front of me so waiting wasn't much of an issue. The restaurant was well packed. Waited about 10min before I was seated. Lucky to sit inside the aircon becos outside was HOT like mad. The moment their glass doors opened to the outside the gusts of hot wind just flew in. Normal water is self serve via a bottle on the table. Orders were taken promply and without hassle. Ordered a beef short rib don and a salted duck egg pork belly don and topped up the 2 to make 2 sets. Salad had a refreshing gingery tang. The miso soup could have been saltier or tastier with its bits of shiitake mushroom but personally thought it was alittle bland. When the mains arrived THAT was the STAR. Tender beef short rib slices with a perfect onsen egg and nicely complemented yet not overingly powerful truffle sauce drizzled on top. Well worth the wait i say. As for the salted duck egg sauce pork belly don, it was acceptable i suppose. Didn't really feel as though the salted egg sauce complemented the pork belly, but thats a personal preference. However, i do think if the seasoned rice used in the beef short rib don was used in the pork belly don that itself would have been quite tasty. Didnt try other sides or items but thats a good idea to return to try them soon
2
Quite impressed with the food so decided to head down before dinner crowd. Was not busy at that point of time. Ordered 2 premium donburis 1 of which never came. Almost done with the foie gras and unagi donburi to find out that our hokkaido scallop donburi was forgotten. Service staff did not even apologise or rushed the order. For 76 bucks for 2 donburis and a beer, would expect more.. all the hype i had about this place is totally gone
3
They have indoor and outdoor dining, but from 1 table to another, it is quite crampy. Be prepared to hear your neighbour table's conversation, or let them hear your conversation.We ordered Superstar roll which is Mentaiko sauce seared salmon over crispy mozzarella cheese, topped with seasoned tempura flakes and Tanuki’s oko sauce. I love the mozzarella cheese, so big chunk like korean rice cake size... The mentaiko sauce is yummy.We also ordered the TANUKI KAISEN CHIRASHI, but we were told that they ran out of Uni, and replaced us with something else. I don't really like their signature mixed rice, and I feel if it is with jap white rice, it will bring out the flavour of the sashimi. We did notice that neighbour table ordered SALMON KAISEN and it looks really nice, but we were too full to try out that.We ordered TRUFFLE SWEET POTATO FRIES too, and there is nothing special about it. Just sweet potato fries, with not very strong truffle smell and taste. The truffle aioli is not bad though, but its just another dipping sauce...Dinner crowd comes in about 7plus, and there will be a queue, so get ready to queue if you are dinnering at that time
4
Love the jap fusion Donburis...My first visit was memorable enough for me to suggest for an adhoc lunch as we were in the vicinity. I had d seasonal foie gras, unagi n scallop while my Friend had the Uni. Food delivered as before! Just a comment on their layout... we seated close to the glass panel and d bar that separates the outdoor from indoor dining. It gets a tad bit warm when seated next to it. Maybe they can lower the aircon tempt which hopefully isn't centralised especially in d later hot- sweltering arvo, and it didn't quite help that the waiters were walkin in and out and the draught was escaping.

We visited this eatery on a weekday during lunch. When we arrived at noon, it was already almost full and we were told only seats at the bar counter were available. Luckily for us, a table was made available and we took it.We ordered rice bowls, including unagi with foie gras and char siew with onsen egg. Both were delicious and presentation was nice.Word has been getting around, as this eatery is one of the very few in the building with queues forming, as we noted on our way out, including tourists lugging their luggages along. One thing though, do check your bill before you pay, as we were charged for an additional rice bowl we did not order.
5
I ordered one of their healthy menu, salmon donburi. Lots of salmon and their signature rice is superb. Tasty and nice! :)
4
Value for money , casual dining place . Go during happy hour , oysters are $2 for for each cocktail ordered , order up to 6 oysters per cocktail . ;) and a plate of salmon sashimi is a must ! Truffle Beef bowls are dope ! But they don't take reservations , so expect to queue 
4
visited for the first time! this place doesn't accept any reservation and i can clearly see the reason why. there's a queue even before 6pm! be sure to be here early to grab a seat! oh ya! the daily fresh oysters are first come first serve basis, by the time we ordered, it ran out :( orderd the Truffle Yakiniku which was highly recommended by the service crew. got some Uncle Hiro's chicken as well.overall, a very pleasent experience, be it if you sit at a counter top indoors where you can see the chefs do the magic, or outdoors where you can bask in Orchard's limelight. both offers a different yet positive experience.
4
We had a big group of 6 adults and 1 baby and had to wait quite a while for them to get a table together. They don't allow for reservations, unfortunately. I had the don with wagyu and foie gras, spam fries and 6 happy hour oysters ($2 each, maximum 6 pcs with any alcoholic drink). My only complain is that a couple of the oysters weren't very fresh (or clean?) and i had a mild allergic reaction. Really loved the rice with wagyu and foie gras. Much more affordable than other places that serve the same thing
3
I seldom rate a place below 4/5 but I'll justify my grade in this way: great setting, average food and bad service. I stood at the counter a good 3 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. The 3 members of the restaurant staff that saw me were very careful to avoid my gaze as it would probably need to be accompanied by a long sentence of the style 'we will be with you shortly' and that was obviously too much to ask for at 12.05PM or maybe it was too early into their shift and they were still warming up. Someone finally came to ask me if I needed a table for one and without a greeting, took me to the bar counter. I had a salmon dish with some signature rice that was completely anonymous and I was out in 15 minutes. The restaurant setting is very nice though so I'll come back when an investor with a flair for the F&B industry takes over

Wow, Japanese Fusion just got better! Lots of people try but these guys just hit a new level. Way to go! Must Try!!! From the Wham Fries (Sweet Potatoes and Marshmallows) to the Foi Gras Donuts, to the Fusion Rolls and Fresh Fresh Fresh Oysters! Well done and thanks very much for the tantilizing meal Tanuki!
4
Tanuki raw is conveniently located at Orchard Central close to Somerset MRT in the shopping district of Orchard. It serves a nice array of Japanese inspired dishes. The foie gras truffle beef rice bowl is excellent and if you come during a cool evening, sitting in the balcony facing Orchard road is a sight to behold. Just be prepared to queue and wait for your table
4
Food is great with big portion! best to go on weekdays for lunch as the lunch menu's set is rather worth it! Food is tasty but not the best for people who don't fancy truffle as they don't offer other sauces to go with beef. Would be better if there were other sauces to go with!
4
My friends and I managed to grab a table at the alfresco area. Even though it was just 6.15pm on a Saturday, the place was crowded. Almost all the tables were taken up. Their happy hour promo runs daily from 5pm to 7pm, with oysters going at $2 each, and cocktails and beers at $10-14 each. I had their popular foie gras and beef yakiniku donburi. It didn't disappoint. The portion was good enough - I couldn't finish it, since I had half a dozen of oysters for my appetiser. Service is lacklustre, which is common in Singapore... but it's okay. Will be back for the donburi. Price-wise, it's not cheap, but it's not back-breaking expensive to dine here
3
I love the whole concept of Tanuki raw, as they have a slight modern twist to the traditional Donburi. The concept reminds me a little of Momofuku, simple food and unfussy service yet still presenting something that is elegant and tasty. Service though was slightly off, coming off as snobbish and rude. Servers with black faces and banging food on the table. Service has to improve as both food and service comes hand in hand. Unless dining at a hawker stall, service like theirs should be extinct
4
You definitely have to come here 😘, this is simple but nice food. The environmental is nice and friendly staff to serve us.
5
Went during cocktail hour and oysters are $2/piece. Food was excellent! Service was really friendly but staff were too busy and it was hard to get their attention. There are long queues after 6.30pm so would recommend coming early!
4
came here on weekend night for decided to drop by. their food is expensive but flavours of it made up for it. i had the beef truffle with the foie gras, honestly awesome food. but service was rather not up to expectations, as they had like 9-10 service staff that day but we couldn't even get ice water. tables were not set properly and to finish off the meal, the bill took long enough. you can do better for service with your huge team, tanuki raw, buck u
4
Came here for dinner after making a last min change of venue and was pleasantly surprised. Had yummy healthy chirashi don paired with yuzu gin (SGD$44). What I like is the rice used which is mixed grain rather than the usual white rice. It's Tuesday so there's a live band. Good food, music and a beautiful evening! Sit outdoors and watch the sky darkens as you have your dinner. Friendly staff made it all the more an enjoyable evening. Will be back soon!
5
The experience here is worthwhile. The food is quite expensive, but to die for. The beef truffle bowl is great. The rice they use for their bowls is also special and tasty with any of their sashimi. Be sure to order their sushi rolls too! This is a great place for a lunch with friends because it gets way too crowded at dinner time.
3
My Wife was the one who brought me to this restaurant because she have visited before with her friends.Before we went there, she told me that we have to arrive early as the restaurant is packed at every meal period and she knows I hate queuing for food regardless how good it is.We arrive at 11:30am and was ushered to a tiny and shaky table which was fairly uncomfortable.The food in general was decent (not fantastic) and it's definitely crowded coz it was pretty much filled up by 12:15pm.I wouldn't say I'll travel all the way back to Orchard just to dine here and definitely will not queue for this restaurant BUT will return if I happen to be around and there's no queue
4
This is such a busy restaurant, as we left there must have been fifty plus in the queue and even more for the adjacent Genki sushi. Almost everyone under thirty which made me feel ancient!The food is an imaginative spin on sushi and virtually all that we tried worked well, occasionally I think not so good but I love the experimentation and the bottom line is that the place was buzzing with happy customers.This restaurant has balcony seating and a great atmosphere, we chatted to the charming and informative American manager who seemed to have the whole thing under control and was a great advert for the company.The waiting staff were brilliant
5
We went to Tanuki Raw and had their lunch set - The Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku and the Chirashi. The quality of the food was outstanding and their service was forthcoming and friendly.The Foie Gras Yakiniku was amazing. It came with a huge piece of pan-seared foie gras that was fantastic and was huge indeed considering the price! It also came with generous slices of angus short rib which were tasty and tender. The combination of the ingredients with the rice and the onsen egg with the truffle soy was phenomenal. We couldn't help but exclaimed how delicious it was!The Chirashi came with salmon belly aburi, salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi, scallop, sea bream, white tuna, yellow tail, swordfish, ikura and tamago all in one bowl of happiness! The ingredients were all exceptionally fresh and that's all you need for a great chirashi indeed! The service was great, one of the waiters was enthusiastic about serving the customers and initiate to offer alternatives to seating as some areas were quite cold. I thought it was a good gesture. The rest of the staff were friendly and patient with their service too, even though the place is getting quite crowded with long queues forming outside. To us, a great restaurant should be judged based on the quality of both the food and the service, and in this respect, Tanuki Raw definitely meet the mark and do hope they continue their excellent practice. Cheers

Was invited to lunch at Tanuki Raw at Orchard Central, and apart from getting a bit lost in the maze of shops and restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. We ordered the Negitoro Don and the Salmon Kaisen lunch sets, which came to only about S$18 (or just Â£10 or USD 12) per person, including miso soup, a green salad and green tea. Being a salmon sashimi lover, I think the Salmon Kaisen was a better option as there were generous chunks of salmon while the Negitoro Don had the tuna minced so finely that it didn't look or feel substantial enough.The place has a nice vibe and is quite spacious with lots of natural light. It's seems really popular, judging from the chattering lunch crowd that packed the restaurant.
3
I heard a lot of positive things about this place. The food. The crowd. The price etc. went there one other time but it was long Q, so we left. Went again yesterday at 2pm, after the office lunch crowd. But it was still packed with people although there's no Q. We got a corner seat... Er, close to the toilet entrance. Not that pleasing. Anyway ordered the food - 1 CHIRASHI don and 1 salmon bowl with lunch set. They asked about the drink several times after the order but the drink never came until halfway through the meal and many reminders. Frankly, the portion looks small but it's quite big. There's a lot of rice. On first few bites, the flavored rice was nice. After awhile it was abit overbearing in taste and the rice was really mushy (too much water). The topping for salmon bowl was quite tasty but I wish there was less rice and abit more fish. Miso soup with the lunch set was so so in taste. No wow factor. The salad, I HATED the dressing. It was awful. The sesame oil in the dressing was over powering and seemed to taste abit off. The green tea is very watered down. Cold or hot (it was served Lukewarm) both tastes like water. I'm not impressed with the food or service. Salmon bowl lunch set was $19+ after taxes. Not too expensive but there's other better lunch sets around for this price too. Will I be back? Maybe to try other lunch bowls... But no real push factor.
3
The chirashi and beef sliders are the only saving grace. The rest of the food are not as appealing. The service needs to improve too

2016 May 3 Our Lunch @Tanuki Raw, Orchard Central. Set Lunch Was Good & Reasonable Price. Restaurant Not Very Big So Be Prepared In Queue.
3
Saw lots of good reviews online and decided to try the foie gras beef bowl. Foie gras was very average and the beef was rather tough. The mentai roll was good tho
2
We found this restaurant to be a bit confused with their menu arrangements. The mixture of ingredients didn't work well together.Food was just average. I had to send my sushi roll back to the kitchen because there was a hair in it. We got no apologies from the staff or management due to this bad mistake.

The Good1. Location in the city with a nice ambience and bar2. Cheap 2$ oysters with a cocktail3. Generous servings for the priceThe BadFoie gras truffle yakiniku - Sauce had good flavour with hint of truffle not overpowering, but was inadequately served . The beef was tough and chewy and could be mistaken for any normal cut. Serving of foie gras was generous but lacked any flavour due to inadequate sauceUni donut - uni was not fresh, and was overpowered by the other flavours, might as well have not been added (but I guess adding uni to anything on the menu makes it sound hip). What does Tanuki style even mean? It just tasted like a glorified donut - which was a good thing but could have perhaps been less hyped up.Spam fies - You can't really go wrong with spam fries, although the thick cut 'fries' make it harder to fry and thus was not as crispy as some others I have tried. But spam though..Golden WHAM! Fries - Sounds cool, but nothing special, flavours blended together quite well, reminiscent of loaded fries I have tried in the past, but actually tasted quite similar to my uni donut minus the uni and donut, which was disconcerting.Mini Truffle Beef Sliders - Was unexpectedly the most enjoyable dish out of everything tried considering it was just a slider. Beef was of better quality than the beef don, if you want mini beef MOS burger with truffle this is for you.Oyster- Ordered together with cocktails so that it was 2$ each, good value. Meaty oysters but lacking any flavour (creaminess or otherwise). If meaty pacific oysters are your thing this will be great for you.Uncle Hiro's chicken - First thought, Big Hero 6. Second thought - why is this rancid? If this is what Tanuki's special recipe with spicy brown miso butter dip tastes like I think ill stick with Popeye's. Was left untouched for the rest of the meal.Spicy negitoro roll - Ordered this as a saving grace after all the food had come so that I could give praise to at least one dish in this restaurant, but it seemed that it was not to be. Otoro is just so easy that you literally just need to serve it. However, the tuna:scallion ratio was dismal, with the quality of the tuna itself disappointing, tasting just like normal tuna. No hint of spicy mayo and since this wasn't one of the saucy maki's, I was presented with a dried up tasteless maki since the tuna was meant to bring add flavour to the dish, with the cucumber giving the crunch and the avocado giving the creaminess. The Ugly Service was to put it plainly, not very god. I scale the level of service with the setting of the place, so lets just say I was not expecting hotel like service or friendly chit chat. Ironically when my sister read the reviews and warned me about the service, I dismissed her and said that the food will satisfy my tummy, not the staff.I was greeted with a very moody looking waiter when we placed our order for appetizers, which was still acceptable, followed by a waiter who had no idea when the restaurant is supplied with their seafood ( I usually check as uni usually does not taste good after a few days) nor did she care to find out, commenting that "only the chef's know", I guess with that attitude only the chef will ever know. The real issue occurred after I was brought a spicy salmon donut (not another donut) instead of my spicy salmon maki. The waitress evidently thought it was my fault and was very accusatory, which I guess is fair since maybe some patrons might not be knowing what they ordered, however I asked her to check with Mr Moody faced man who took the order in order to clarify. Upon realising her mistake, she told me to wait as it was coming. Perhaps i'm spoiled, but an apology would have been nice.Fast forward 20 minutes and i'm still waiting but my table is still lacking of a spicy maki. Upon checking with the staff again, it appeared within 30 seconds. So either they sent my order to the back of the queue instead of prioritising it (which I feel they should have since it was their mistake), or they left it on the counter for quite a long time (I would like to believe it was the first option), still not good either way.ConclusionI was honestly most excited for the beef/egg don, as Japanese rice, beef and onsen egg is such a good combination, but might have to stick to Fat Cow during lunch times to satisfy my wallet and cravings in the future

We went for lunch with few colleagues as our office was nearby. Incidentally their stove was broken but thankfully the raw stuff was available. Would like to go back to try the various set meals. Salmon was plentiful and portion overall was generous. Price was justified. Recommended for casual lunch in a nice corner of Orchard central.
4
Had to queue 45mins to get seats for a table of 3. This was on a Friday night at 7pm. The food did not disappoint. They had interesting truffle fries with marshmallow. Wagyu beef don was delicious. The sushi were fresh too. Better to come at off peak hours
4
I was here with my friends to have a birthday celebration. One of my friend took time off to come here and queue early, otherwise it will be long queue. Queue before 6.30pm.We ordered Truffle Yakiniku, Salted Duck Egg Char Siew Don, Salmon Don and Chirashi Don. If you are not a beef and raw food person, then you can try Salted Duck Egg Char Siew Don which was tender and soft. Usually, I will get rid of the "fats" from the meat but this was really too yummy and it melted in your tongue. I just put everything in my mouth.For drink there will be happy hour before 8pm. Each oyster was $2, fresh and delicious. each We ordered Sake Honey, beer, white wine, Kyoto Protocol, Yuzu Gin Fizz, Lychee and Rose. My favourite and recommended drinks were Kyoto Protocol and Yuzu Gin Fizz. It has a light and smoothing taste
5
It has a long queue by 7 pm but managed quickly. Very friendly staff and we loved eating by the bar. I have an adult son so we enjoyed our drinks. Food was wonderful! Our faves were the Sweet Potato Fries, Truffle Yakiniku and the Salmon Sashimi!❤

It was a very unexpected but pleasant experiece at this restaurant. We went for their dinner menu. They had a promotion for oysters with every 'alcoholic' brewerage ordered. And we tried their signature dishes. Wow! Wow wow. Very delicious. Will be going back again.Also like that they serve all sorts of cocktails.Have to be there early else once the dinner crowd starts the wait can be long
3
Came here to try the oysters during the 5-8pm happy hour. Limit of 6 oysters (at $2 each) per drink. Had some salmon sashimi also. The sashimi was decent but the oysters were pretty average. Service was friendly and reasonably efficient.
3
Need to queue, food overall ok.
saturday come with lunch set, nice.
recommend the foie gras truffle yakiniku-donbur, so full.
4
I liked the food but just glad we arrived around 6 and missed the insanely long queue that magically appeared right after! I don't like fois gras so just had the yakiniku don, meat was a bit too chewy but tasty, couldn't finish the rice. We also got a maki and spam fries. Cocktails seemed nice and not too pricey either, payed around 30sgd with no drinks. Less one star as the second jug of tap water is chargeable and staff is not friendly.Might just deliver home if I feel like it again
3
Went early before the lunch crowd started flowing in. Tried the recommended foie gras truffle yakiniku and tanuki kaisen chirashi. The angus short rib was flavorful, but I did not like the foie gras. The sauce was slightly too much and made it very salty. On the contrary, the chirashi was blend, however I liked the thick cut sashimi, but not all were fresh
3
We were expecting much and...we got little!Actually food-wise, the restaurant is mostly good (foie gras donburi is great but don't waste your money on the duck confit).I just found the service to be lacking and the food good but NOT delicious...I would recommend for quick launch maybe
4
Went here with a group of friends and family. Tried their famous Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku, the beef was juicy but i'm not really liking the foie gras. My husband tried the Truffle Yakiniku (without foie gras) and he liked it. Though space was a bit challenging, they still provide baby chair. For me the star of the dishes that we ordered was their Sweet Potato Truffle Fries, it's my recommendation of what to try from this restaurant. We went for dinner but it was packed and the queue was very long. Tried again the next day for lunch and we were the first customers there. If you don't like waiting, try coming for early lunch/dinner, maybe the queue isn't so bad
5
We 3 came from pretty afar across the island to have the bowl of foie gras truffle goodness and what a delight it was. Knocked back some 'back to work' drinks and wished we could dwell a bit longer if it had a larger dessert menu. Will be back

I'm a rather well-traveled gourmet, having dined at a vast multitude of 3 starred michelin restaurants and street-side food stalls all over the world and I can say with confidence that Tanuki Raw serves quite literally the most disgusting donburi I've ever tasted. I'd encourage people to go try it just to experience how bad it is. So, I proceeded to try out their appetizers, one look and you could tell they have been sitting out for a long time, overly salty, mushy fries, I'm quite literally taken aback how this restaurant manages to screw up even the most basic items. I ordered their salted-egg yolk donburi as recommended by their staff and the rice is spiked with i don't even know what, it tasted overwhelmingly sour with this strange taste that is reminisce of food that has gone bad, the salted egg yolk sauce was savory but lacks a distinctive salted egg punch and the entire dish as a whole, tries to blend the savoriness of the sauce and the sourness of the rich together but fails completely, what you get is this terrible mess where you taste the savoriness then it quickly snaps to that sourness which makes you quite literally gag and feel like puking. I only had a max of 5 mouthfuls, believing that it'd get better but no, it didn't it only got worse. Service level is horrendous too, slow, unresponsive and the staff looked as though they're being forced to work. I understand that there has been some hype about this place but my personal experience was a disaster and the food served, well lets just say I'd rather forget how it tasted to save myself from this traumatic memory. like how can you screw up plain rice
5
The only set back is the long queue that you've to wait before dining in.Asides from that, the food is of tip top standards and the beef was really cooked to perfection. Foie Gras was of the very generous sizing which is surprising and the cooked result was very impressive.Had Happy Hour Wine that goes with the $1 Oysters offered. but the quality was not spectacular. It was small and flat oysters and probably only satisfies taste craving wise
4
The lunch sets in Tanuki are winners! I recommend the Negitoro Don, the Foie Yakiniku, and the Salmon Kaisen Don. They are served with miso soup and cabbage salad. By topping up 5sgd, one can choose a premium beverage (such as Cooler Than Lychee, or Ginger Lemonade). And why not? Tanuki began as a bar:
4
The negative - long queue as the place is popular. Once seated, good service, good food, good drinks and good music. Value for money
3
Located in Orchard Central . Very popular so expect long queue . Open bar concept . Indoor and outdoor seating . Specialise in sushi roll and sushi bowl . Different from conventional Japanese sushi roll or bowl . We had foie gras and beef with truffle oil rice bowl which is quite special The rice that they use is not vinegar rice but brown rice .
4
I love the food, especially Salmon Kaisen. The price is very reasonable for big and good food. I would love to go again sometime. However, the service is actually fine, but there is some staff who will give you that "look" - fierce. haha.. which is unpleasant yah..Overall, I dont really care, overall I love the place and food. TOP
4
Stopped by a few weeks ago for lunch with a friend at Tanuki in Orchard CentralOrdered for the Angus Short Ribs Don. Got exactly what was expected. Good solid well done donburi. The portion is sizeable. Nothing extraordinary but very good stuff. A tad overpriced in my opinion but hey...this is at Orchard Road in Singapore. Someone has to pay for the rent.Will return
3
I wouldn't say they're very good. If you can eat beef, the signature truffle beef don with onsen egg is the best!DON'T order the Salted Egg Pork Ribs bowl! It's nowhere close to salted egg taste at all. Tasted more like rotten egg to me than salted egg really and it makes my stomach feel funky after since I have no idea why salted egg in their mind comes with hint of sour taste. So if you're expecting rich intense taste of salted egg, forget it! It makes me want to throw up after...The mentaiko roll is really good with generous mentaiko sauce
4
The (not so) new anymore Tanuki Raw is almost 2-3x the size of the original outlet, comes with outdoor seating and live band. Ambiance was so good! My friend took me there for birthday dinner treat. We ordered quite abit to share:1. Old Fashioned whiskey - didnt have as much alcohol as my friend had hoped.2. Sake Honey - liked the taste, refreshing3. Raw oysters - during happy hours, it was a mere $2 each! We ordered a dozen of them to share. They were fresh but was not handled properly (washed cleaned or opened properly), there were alot of oyster shell on the meat.4. Superstar roll - very good, tasty and addictive!5. Spicy Tuna roll - soft and tasty, we loved this dish as well. No fishy after taste at all!6. WHAM fries - this one was a little disappointing. There was very very little cheese (if at all) and sour cream was not generous as well. We asked for more and they graciously obliged :) Taste was flat. Overall bill came up to be about $80 which was not too expensive. Would go back again during off peak hours, cos we had to queue for quite awhile before we had a seat
5
Tanuki Raw has the best deals for lunch! A bowl full of sashimi at less than 20 dollars along with a set of miso soup, salad and free refill of green tea! If you are a fanatic of oysters, oysters are at the way way cheaper price during happy hours from 6pm onwards with the purchase of an alcoholic drink! However, it can get very pack during lunch and dinner and no reservation is allowed, so get there early!
4
Foie gras truffle yakiniku was the best and must order for every visit. Tried salted duck egg char Siew, truffle sweet potato fries, wham fries, and Uncle hiro's chicken for differents visited, and their just so so only compared with the foie gras yakiniku. Instagram This Maki was good and big portion, worth of money if u don't expect any seafood species for ur maki. Will come back very soon.

What a disappointment!After reading all the reviews, I was excited about trying something 'new'. We arrived at the restaurant and like most 'good' (apparently) places in Singapore you can expect a queue. It went pretty quickly, so that was a good start. The cocktails and choice of beers (which got our vote) aren't too bad. So far, so good! Food time! Everything looks so amazing and yes, it is mouthwatering...but there is a catch! Do not believe the descriptions of each dish on offer. We ordered a bit of everything from the menu, including chicken wings, char Siew, spicy vegetables, sashimi, duck tacos.... Chicken wings tasted as if they were taken straight out of the freezer, and deep fried. Spicy vegetable weren't spicy, had no flavour and instead they walloped on a table spoon of A1 sauce mixed with Worcester sauce. What a waste of calories.Do I need to describe the other dishes? Be wise! Make a good choice
4
We enjoyed eating here on a Sunday night. Surprisingly no queue. We had the Truffle Sweet Potato fries (yum!), Truffle foi gras yakiniku (very good), salmon sashimi kaisen (good) and bara chirashi (good and plenty of seafood!) and the white house wine. All good, portions were rather generous! Very enjoyable, and food was served pretty fast. Service was good
4
I always order Bara Chirashi from Tanuki Raw, because they are cut up into pieces which makes it easier for consumption. Lunch set are really affordable.
3
Gyu-don was average in taste, service was good. Egg was done spot on and so was the ambience (bar by night). The hint of truffle was there but the beef lacked in quality of the Fat Cow (favourite Jap beef place), then again it's buck for buck.Overall, lunch sets are affordable and gets the job done. Still, the hype of long queues for Tanuki is still pretty much overrated
4
Honestly, I have a doubt when came here for dinner. After we tried the food, I was a bit surprised...... Most of the foods are quite good. The Bara Chirasi was awesome!! Very generous with the sashimi portion. The salmon sashimi also very fresh and good quality. The yakiniku with the foei gras is to die for. Don't order the beef sliders.... Honest that was the worst food that we ordered
3
The happy hour at one location has free appetizers and the other location doesn't. This leads to expectations problems when doing research on the web to decide where to go. The two locations should do the same offer. We arrived only to start disappointed. The seating staff was a abrupt and not concerned with what the customer wants, only what they wanted to fill in seats. On the positive - bar staff are great and food is quite unique and remarkable.
4
My first time in Orchard Central after a long time. Tanuki Raw is on the 4th floor and not on the 2nd if you've read some reviews that indicated the unit number incorrectly. Being a solo diner, I was placed at the bar counter. It's nice sitting at the bar, where you can see the bartender preparing drinks, but just that you get waves of heat coming through the glass doors, behind the bar counter and from the patio for outdoor seatingFood was good. I had the Chirashi don, with 5-6 different fish and scallop, with tamago sitting in a bed of Tanuki special rice, which I think is lightly seasoned brown rice. I would go back for the Foie Gras Truffle rice bowl, which I saw my Neighbour having and there was a giant slab of foie gras on top of the rice. Overall, a very nice dining experience.
4
Came here on a Saturday for a quick lunch, after a pleasant experience at their "parent"-restaurant Standing Sushi Bar.Queue moved with acceptable speed, service was fast and no-frills. Place was crowded but well laid-out, and the food could have been awesome.Except it wasn't.Well, truth is, I loved the tender beef slices and that delicious hint of truffle in my Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku Don. The foie gras was also very tasty, save for the fact that its natural sweet, buttery flavor was utterly ruined by this horrendous, overly-salty sauce which they generously heaped all over the foie gras.This sauce was definitely too salty to start with, regardless of what it's poured over. But to pour it all over the foie gras was unacceptable and a sin. Why would any decent cook destroy the natural goodness of foie gras like that?I was really turned off by the sauce, even though I had so been looking forward to trying this dish at Tanuki Raw. Rather disappointed at the outcome of my first visit there.Will I go back? Perhaps. But next time I'll remember to tell them in advance, that I want no sauce in my donburi
4
Knowing that the restaurant does not take reservations, we arrived expecting to wait in line for an hour. The host was very friendly and understanding as he tried to accommodate our large party. We didn't have to wait very long and were seated in time to enjoy happy hour and the live performance. The food is not typical Japanese but rather, an adventurous fusion. Try the Spam Wham. You've never had anything like it

Recently the casual Japanese restaurant has reopened at the shopping centre. It is now located at level 4, with a bigger dine in area. Similar to its previous location, it has both indoor and outdoor dine in area. As the restaurant was crowded, I decided to ask for outdoor dine in area, which was still has quite a number of tables as most felt that it was quite hot to dine outdoor. Compared to indoor, I felt outdoor was better as indoor was filled with cooking smell. Sitting in outdoor, one also can enjoy the great view of the busy Orchard Road. While looking through the menu, I was served iced water. A bit disappointed as the water was not refilled. Maybe sitting outdoor was not so good after all, as it was difficult to get the attention of the staffs.Although it was weekend, the restaurant offered lunch menu. Just add $2++ to the main dish to make it a lunch set. I decided to have a Premium Set by topping $5++. The set included miso soup, green salad, and coffee or "Back to work" beverage. Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku ($19.90++)pan-seared foie gras, US black angus short rib, onsen egg, truffle soy, black garlic brown butter over Tanuki's signature mixed riceThe foie gras was quite buttery and melt in the mouth. The beef was quite tender and moist. The mixed rice was tasty on its own.Shio Smooth (a la carte $5++)fresh shiso, matcha green tea, lemon, blended with iceIt was my choice of "Back to work" beverage. It was light and refreshing in taste. Just the right to have during such a hot day.Overall the food was not bad. But the service needed to be improved as it was quite difficult to get the attraction of the staffs

came for dinner not really planned with a small group of friends. we thought to eat somewhere midrange in town and decided to try Tanuki's range of happy hour deals and dinner. Not a bad decision! Arrived around 7pm without dinner reservations and JUST IN TIME to miss the sudden huge line that developed as soon as we sat down! I think some people probably waited at least 15-20 mins for a table. the restaurant itself was quite sizeable though with indoor, outdoor and bar seating available. we were able to nab a table for 4 which was idealhappy hour deals - we went straight for the $2 dollar oysters (one friend ordered the honey sake cocktail which was $10 during happy hour to suffice for our order of a dozen oysters). oysters were nice and fresh! with a dash of tobasco and vinegar slurped them down in no time.our mains took a bit longer to arrive - 2 sushi bowls arrived first (guess minimal cooking) with very decent portions of (if i remember correctly, 4 salmon cuts and added roe on top). there was salmon sashimi, 2 types of seared salmon and i think some cubed/mentaiko dressed salmon. seared was the tastiest but the sashimi was also of adequate freshness! we had them with the salad base to be healthy (need to top up $1 for salad). the other 2 got the char siew pork belly with salted egg sauce and onsen egg on rice - was another beautiful bowl. flavours were super rich and tasty but by the end with all the rice also got slightly gelat (but worth it). we almost ordered another dish or 2 to share but by the end of the servings were decently full. went for dessert AFTER though of course - tanuki didn't really have dessert we were looking for.only con was that the pork bowls took a bit too long to come (staff seemed pretty rushed around the place). one pork bowl came first then waited a few minutes for the 2nd one (the salmon came almost 10 mins earlier). but it was a pretty packed seating so OK i guess...still would recommend the place and there is LOTS more stuff on the menu that we wanted to try another time
3
Came here for dinner last week and had a few cocktails during happy hour (at $10++ before 8pm) supplemented with a selection of food dishes and some oysters. Overall bill was around $130 for 2 which seemed a bit expensive for what we had and the quality
4
Seared foie gras, US black angus beef, onsen egg, miso soup, green salad and mixed rice. Oishiii😋
5
Enjoyed the happy hour & oyster hour. (5-8pm) Oysters at only $2 each (6 max) when you get their drinks! Apart of that, the mains were also a delight. Must try the chirashi!
5
Hands down to this place. Look at the huge size of the foie gras.. Everything here is just so good. Would defo come here again :)
4
Trendy and yummy!
The donburi sets were great in terms of taste as well as value.
Definitely will be back. I saw they have a wicked happy hour too.
4
Quite an interesting concept with outdoor seating facing the busy Orchard Road.
Must try their Truffle yakiniku don and Steak tartar
4
Newly opened at Orchard Central. This place is packed with queue forming even for Sunday lunch.I would rate this as casual dining and we both ordered truffle sweet potatoes fries as side. Nice and love the fries. We have both ordered Salmon Kaisen and Bara Chirashi both sashimi with rice set. It comes with miso soup, salad and Japanese Green tea. Salad dressings are unique and the miso soup has added mushroom. Both the don unique due to the rice which was tossed with sauce.The bill comes up to $50 plus including all taxes. Generally value for money but the price of the sweet potatoes fries is expensive.
3
Had the famous Tanuki beef Bowl as per recommended by most that goes there. The standards of the bowls defer from time to time. I had been there twice and tried 3 bowls from them (3 because i tried my friends) and notice that the cut of the meat there are quite different.The overall taste of the beef bowl is good with decent tasty sauce and perfectly cooked meat (on one occasion). The other 2 occasion i was serve meat that was full of fats and it makes one wonder if there were any meat at all. The Fats are also not the kind that melts in the mouth but the kind where it is hard to chew with tendons everywhere.side dishes are slightly expensive but it comes in great portion. Takes 3 people to finish the spam fries. All in all, if the quality of the beef bowl is improved, i wouldnt mind having meals there more ofte
3
Staff were friendly and quick to respond. Tried the truffle yakiniku, foie gras version, chicken, duck helmet and the sushi. The donburis could be warmer. Mixed the egg and rice and it was fantastic just by itself. The beef was a little tough. The chicken was quite succulent and tender. Duck helmet was interesting as I wasn't expecting it to be cold dish with seafood tacos. Should come during happy hour to try the oysters and drink
3
The place was known for oyster, but unfortunately as one who had been to New Orleans and experienced the top notch oyster galore, this one was utterly disappointing. The oysters were not that big, tasted not so fresh either. Moving on to donburi, we ordered Yakiniku Donburi and Eel Grilled with Foie Gras Donburi. Both were nice, meats were tender and juicy with good amount of sauces. Foie Gras size is large, made it very worth of the price. Try to come on happy hour too, 6 to 8 pm. Drinks list is not so exciting, only couple of beers available, but at least they got Asahi. Services is something discouraging here, we ordered chirashi bowl as well and asked to exclude the tuna yet it was still served. Bartender (female) was shouting rudely, not clear whom she was addressing her speech but she was asking to place last order urgently otherwise she would not entertain it afterwards. Very unpleasant to hear and awkward as the guests were still there. Overall we might return for the donburi and happy hour for its sashimi but to bear with the service would be something to think about

Went to this restaurant this evening with five friends and had a horrible experience, and left without bothering to get a table. While queuing, we asked the waiters if they could arrange a table for six as we noted that most of the tables were small tables meant for two. The waiters were reluctant to give us a definitive answer. Shortly after when we had reached the head of the queue, two tables became vacant and we asked if our group could get those tables joined so that four of us could sit down while we waited for the third table next to it to be vacant. The waiters refused, claiming that it would block the passageway (when it clearly didn't appear so). They said they would give the two tables up to the customers behind us who were dining as a couple. They became agitated when I asked again if they could arrange for a table of six in the restaurant, since it did not appear that they were able or willing to do so. We decided to leave since they were so rude and did not seem interested to seat our group of six. Didn't get to try the food but if the service standards are anything to go by, we didn't miss much. Will never return.

Loved dinner at Tanuki Raw. As far as we know the only place with oyster happy hour, which makes the oysters very reasonably priced. The fantasy maki's were also great. Good wine also at a decent price. Good service, so we'll be back!
5
We were here on a Saturday and were lucky to get a seat outside to enjoy the view and the live band.
The oysters are delicious.
5
While it's not cheap and the bowl looked deceptively small, Tanuki Raw actually delivered value for money. I tried their beef yakiniku rice with onsen egg, foie gras, sauteed mushrooms, topped with truffle sprinkle. It was the best version of gyuudon I've ever tried here. The drink selections are quite good too. The ambiance was rather nice and mellow, a good place to wind down after a hectic day at work. The staffs were nice and friendly. Definitely my new favourite
4
Visited Tanuki Raw for the truffle yakiniku don and it met my expectations! I've had better beef don, but this wasn't too bad. For its price (during lunch), it's worth a try. Portion might not be sufficient for big eaters though.Service here was just average
4
Ordered the instagram-worthy Truffle Takiniku Don which definitely did not disappoint! The black angus short rib was beautifully complemented with truffle soy sauce and a delicate onsen tomago. There are special lunch rice dons available with prices ranging from $12 for a Salmon Don to $17.80 for a Bara Chirashi Don! Service was rather average but the comfortable atmosphere and fresh quality food definitely makes Tanuki Raw a place worth visiting
3
Have visited Tanuki twice now, once as a couple and another time with a friend. Both visits the service was subpar, very typical of Singapore service at most restaurants. The menu is creative and the food and drinks are good. Will be back and would recommend Tanuki if in the immediate area, just don't expect much for service
3
Main attraction was the happy hour promotions. Oysters today was ice cold and tasty, frankly having been to oyster bars overseas and at hotels such as Ritz, Hyatt and Shang- the deal at $2 is value. Yes, not the most plump and creamiest I have tasted but it's definitely stellar for the price.Instagram This Sushi Roll however tasty was soaked in oil at the base of the plate as it wasn't drained throughly before serving. A costly mistake
2
I'd still prefer Standing Sushi Bar, the same brand that brings Tanuki Raw.I just feel it is trying too hard to come out with new, modern sushi, which in my opinion, is not nice at all. The happy hour specials must be ordered with alcoholic drinks, otherwise, one might just pass it up if it is on usual price.
1
The manager was useless and rude, didn't follow up regarding a menu question. The staff could not wait for us to leave. The food was adequate, however they charged for extra ketchup and did not get the order right....didn't bring one of the items and got another item wrong. Good music though, I suppose.
4
Would have given this restaurant 3 stars based on its service and price, but the quality of food deserved an extra star. Service left much to be desired, waitress barely said a word to us and relied solely on nodding and the prodding of her pen on our menu. I tried the Salmon Mentaiko Don and Truffle Yakiniku Don (beef) and I was brimming with delight because both dishes were palatable and I finished my main rice bowl (Yakiniku Don) within minutes and I stared longingly as my friend was still savouring the Salmon Mentaiko bowl. Personally, I felt like Ratatouille when he tried the cheese and strawberry together - there was a burst of flavour in every bite - and I wish I was rich enough to go there every alternate day for their rice bowls.However, I found the portion to be quite small for $18 and $20. Overall, I feel that the price and service could be more impressive to complement their food
3
I ordered a Salmon don for dinner. It was tasty and nice but the portion was too small. Very little salmon on a bed of little rice. For $20, it wasn't very worth it. Service was okay but slow. Tasty food nonetheless.
4
good food, service attended promptly. However, i was shocked when the waiter replied about $2.50 per person to be charged if to consume cake in restaurant. Better if to be told that no outside food to be allowed...than to be charged.
5
Food. was. awesome. All their rice bowls were delicious (tried it all more than once). Most of all, I love their service! :D They were all warm and welcoming and I was so glad I celebrated my birthday there. Special thanks to AXL who made my night magical!MUST TRY dishes apart from their donburis are the Fish Taco and American Cheeseburger sushi
4
Had heard about this beef don and I had to come try it.They are located at Orchard Central Mall, with indoor air conditioned and outdoor alfresco seating. On the menu, it’s the Truffle Yakiniku Don: $16.30. Its actually beef short rib, cooked sous vide and pan seared before being sliced and placed atop Japanese short grain rice. Its has chopped up truffle and a half boiled onsen egg on it with some slices of pickled radish. You break the egg and fold it into the rice and eat it together with the beef.The beef is rather fatty at some parts. Taste-wise, its yummy and I finished the bowl in 5 minutes
5
We ate at Tanuki Raw in Singapore on the last night of our vacation. It was one of the best meals we had during our stay. The restaurant is not that large but happily accommodated our party of 10. The food and service were excellent and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant when visiting Singapore
2
The happy hour $2 per oyster is pretty much overrated. You're likely to get a paper thin oyster! For happy hour you're better off at kpo or Malone nearby. Though the rice bowl here is pretty good ! Picture of the oyster is at macro mode !
3
Dined on a date. Fancied the $2 oyster attraction. Got conned, big time. They can only be bought if you order alcoholic drinks. The catch - we don't do alcohol. The merchant should be specific with full details of their promos. What a bummer!We had Salmon Sashimi. 5 skinny pieces at $17 was a let down. Should have option for chunkier cuts. Having double orders would taxed our appetite. We need room for variety.The Garlic Fries, also at $17 was "ok" .... but nothing to shout about. Having been weaned on McDonald fries it just wasn't the Real Thing. We abandoned half of what was served in the basket it came in. Crazy!The Rock Star (sushi rolls) was deliciously divine. Scorched salmon slice atop the rice, the rice bursting with mozzarella cheese within - infinite yum yum. Great! 4 pieces for $10 just about to break my bank... but certainly worth it. For Sure!We also had the Truffle Yakiniku Donburi - 13 slivers of pan-seared black angus short rib in soy sauce. Yellow pickled daikon radish - all 3 slices ...plus a soft boiled egg (claimed to be onsen egg). This bowl dish costs $18. This was indeed a wonder-full dish. We wondered if it was too pricey for what we got. We wondered if they really had a Japanese spring in the premises to fashion the egg. We wondered where the truffle went for we tasted none. We wondered if we should have wandered to another diner. We are still wondering..
4
Had rare Happy Hour with better half and the hangover was well worth it. Superb drinks offering during Happy Hour at Tanuki Raw. Lycée Martini rated Class 1 and definitely concentrated and value for $ unlike the diluted versions commonly found elsewhere. Sake Honey equally good when paired with the succulent salmon sashimi (I would pay more for thicker slices). Albeit the oysters were sadly minuscule but hey! what can you expect when it's S$2 per shell. Everyone must try their sushi rolls esp. Chicken or the Sea, the Don's are skippable. The new Banana cocktail lacks power though and need better quality and riper bananas. We sat outdoor which was refreshing cooling after the rare January shower and we had a ball of a time
4
Casual eatery with the unique specialty of serving raw food. All very fresh and reasonably priced. Their lunch sets are great value for money from $12 plus $2 to add miso soup, salad and green tea. We had the Salmon Don and Truffle Yakiniku Don. Both came with specially prepared Japanese rice with herbs - very delicious! The salmon came in 3 different ways of cooking and even with the roe. The Yakiniku had a very decent amount of tender beef slices and a soft runny egg. A surprisingly enjoyable lunch and quite a find. Service was helpful and friendly.
4
Had a great time at Tanuki Raw and will definitely be going back. Probably one of the cheapest cocktails in Singapore, definitely anywhere near Orchard Road, but still a decent martini despite the price. The oysters were cheap, fresh, tasty and plentiful. The setting above Orchard Road allows you to escape the melee, and sitting on the terrace you can forget that you're in a shopping centre! Only criticisms would be the slightly, but not unforgivably, slow service, and the terrace outside was looking a bit tatty when we were there.Highly recommen
