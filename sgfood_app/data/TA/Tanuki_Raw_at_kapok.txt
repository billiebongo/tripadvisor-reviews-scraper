Visited Tanuki Raw before 3pm as there are lunch deals on their rice bowls. However even after GST and service charge it came up to $17 for the truffle beef bowl. Bowls are delicious though!! So worth the splurge somewhat.

Sushi was the only disappointing dish. Should have taken it first before the flavorful rice from the main dish

What should I call this cuisine? Japanese tapas and Japanese hipster bowls? I had a toufu rice bowl which wasn't too bad. A bit dear at $14 for toufu and rice but it was tasty and the toufu had the same texture as agadashi toufu.

This cosy branch is housed in the arts district and popular with students, offering economical lunch sets and a bar for happy hours drinks after work.

Reservation was easy and fuss-free. When we got there early, we were shown to our table promptly. Food was definitely very instagram-worthy. I've always wanted to try a few of the donburi(s) but always get swayed when I see the generous portion of salmon on the Mentaiko bara and end up ordering this. This time, I tried the foie gras truffle yakiniku. Was a bit disappointed with the beef used. Would have been perfect if they had used good grade wagyu instead, which I suppose will come at a higher price. Just my 2 cents worth. Friends were very happy with their Mentaiko bara and unagi foie gras donbur

I was there for lunch with for 2 occasions. Once I had their beef bowl and another day I had their maki rolls. Both were good, but the maki rolls portion aren't really huge. We went on a Tuesday and the rolls were on 50% so they were a good deal, but I am not sure about paying the full price for the same rolls. The staff are really helpful but it seems not everyone is aware of what current promotion there is at the moment. Best to check their website or Facebook

A great place to hang out after work in a sophisticated dining place. For every cocktails, martinis, pint of beer ordered, you get to order 6pcs of oysters at $2. Itâ€™s of great value. Tried the signature dishes such as Sweet Potato Truffle Fries, Truffle Yakiniku, Superstar roll and instagram this maki. They are worth giving a try. But will I go again, probably when I miss the valued oysters.

I had the Foie Gras Truffle Beef Don and the serving portion was quite big for a bowl. Visited during lunch on a weekday but it was quite packed though not full, considering its hidden location within the National Design Centre building. They have a wide variety of dons to choose from the menu and we also had the truffle sweet potato fries which was super good! It is quite pricey but I'll revisit again to try other dishes on the menu

Would you pay s$15 for a coffee and cake set in an unassuming cafe in Singapore? (You have to pay about s$7-9 for coffee or cake individually.) Worse, the cake was so dry that I had to gulp buckets of water to make it more palatable. One saving grace was the amazing, flavorful green tea latte. And, of course, plenty of empty seats; no need to Q here.

Very special concoction of traditional Japanese dishes with a twist of western favor. Value for money .. Must try

Ordered oysters, waited 30 minutes.
Ordered donburi, waited 45 minutes - was then told "we didn't take your order"
Best to phone ahead 2 days in advance to ensure your 5 minute preparation time donburi is ready!

First and foremost, WARNING: the portions are HUGE! So if you are a small eater, I hope you have a companion who has a bigger appetite.
Interesting choice of food, though the range is limited.
Pretty casual layout, and very comfortable ambience.
Price wise: reasonable.

I had the salmon skins and the tuna donburi. Salmon skins were very tasty. But the donburi was lacking in flavour. The service was average and not overly attentive.

Three of us ordered mentiko don and foie gras+ beef don which tasted fresh and nice !The happy hour for oysters and beer also made us quite happy! $2 per oyster is quite a steal in Singapore . The only wish is the oysters can be creamier.The place can get quite noisy when it is full as space is of constraint, so tables are near one another. The plus point is you can adjourn to other cafes near Middle Road and Bugis after dinner

We were walking around middle road area and chance upon this restaurant. It has a nice ambience. The food is nicely presented. Very tasty. However a little bit ji lat. Too flavourful till loss appetite. The craft beer on tap are very refreshing. Food is mid range price. Mainly japanese fusion typed food

Tanuki Raw is nestled right in a cozy corner of Kapok (designer boutique store)We ordered 2 donburi (Japanese rice bowls - Charsiew and Yuzu Chicken) and a cold brew. Honestly speaking, air ventilation there was quite bad , when we set foot into Kapok, we were greeted by a strong lingering pesky smell of food (eggs + sauces + whatever) I wouldn’t call that an aroma (like coffee). It’s just the kinda smell if you eat strong smelling foods in an air conditioned place. It was my third time stepping in Kapok , and I never thought I would ever settle down for a meal there because of the smell , but i did anyway..Their cold brew was good - not too acidic for an intolerant stomach like mine.... but it was a chore finishing up the donburi. The first few spoonfuls were...hmm not too bad.... but it gets really tiring as you dig in further and attempt to finish the entire serving. The chicken was really stiff - it was exercise for my jaws for a good 10 mins or so.While I was battling to finish up to move on, there was a gathering of staff (yes the cafe staff) chitchatting just next to my table (less than 2m away). They were so loud that I could hear their conversations very clearly - sharing about their daily lives - before and after work etc etc. All I only wanted was to have some peace eating my dinner?Anyway, service was prompt and I really appreciate that

I came back to Singapore just for a week and friends suggested to visit this place as it is near her office. I hate to say this but the girls (waiters) gave me a very strange expression when I first enter the restaurant she had no smile whatsoever and forget about her coming over to take my orders, I waited for 10 mins at the veranda no one came, so I went in and she saw me, but proceeded to walk to the drinks counter and another girl had to walk from behind me, to serve me. What an attitude this girl has!!!! I am determine to just get my lemonade, catch up with my friends and that's it- will not order any more than a drink from the menu. It's a shame, you have such a nice concept but bad service stuff ultimately will cause your business

We tried the beef truffle, mentaiko bara and the black garlic negitoro. They are delicious, especially the rice. During the happy hours, I ordered a Sake Honey alcoholic drink that comes with free beef gyoza, and discounted fresh oysters. The price is reasonable and today, it has no queue at the Bugis branch

A gorgeous colleague suggested this place for a group celebration dinner & fun! It was a Friday evening, with prior reservation we were promptly seated by 6.30pm. At Tanuki Raw at Kapok it is all about Japanese fusion and dotoburi, plus sake-theme drinks too! The place is bright with a cozy comfortable feel. The dining area is embedded with the shopfront, surrounded by lots of sales merchandise. It is certainly casual and homely; seats less than 50 and looks unique. There are also few alfresco seats outside, for those who loves to feel the breeze.Well-known for its Happy Hour cocktails and appetisers like oysters and sashimi. We had rounds of cocktails (all at $10 ea) but most prefer the Lychee Martini, The Apple/Mint taste more “mint-ish” while ginger-aftertaste was strong for the Moscow Mule. We got lots of Sweet Potato Truffle Fries and salmon skin to go with the drinks. The salmon skin was addictive, smooth and yet crispy while the fries wasn’t excessively saltish.. The crack wings smells and taste just wonderful.The menu dishes are innovative too – we ordered one of each type to share. Their famous Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku is unique, the beef was juicy. The lighter version of truffle Yakiniku don has light taste beef while the Pork Belly Salted Egg don is generously served with juicy US short rib atop Japanese rice, draped in soya sauce and onsen egg! To go meat-light try the spicy garlic miso tonfu do ($14) with cubes of bean curd. I personally don’t like the taste.. LWe had great fun and enjoyed ourselves much in the relaxed environment. The service is ok but they neglected our request for water twice! I would not rate the food a 4/5-star but Tanuki Raw with its hype is definitely a great spot for gatherings with friends after work. Rather unconventional, and the ambient setting something to shut about.
