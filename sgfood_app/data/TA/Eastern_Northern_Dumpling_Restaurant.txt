This is a simple but very consistent restaurant with very good quality fresh food.
Their dumplings are great as are their noodles.
We have never had a bad meal there and will always happily take visitors there.

Can sit in side aircon, clean place, good variety of dumplings and other dishes, good service but hard to get a smile (as usual in Singapore)... allow you to BYO wine which is great.

Eastern & Northern Dumpling Restaurant does has good Northern Chinese food.
Price is reasonable but parking is difficult along the road

Interestingly you will find lots of trophies and walls adorned with basketball photographs. On enquiring I was informed by the tall lady who is the owner that she and her husband were both professional basket ball players in China and now run this restaurant which is also called Tall girl restaurant. The food is delicious. we were recommended cabbage dumplings which were yummy and we had pork noodle soup and tofu in a delicious sauce. Home cooked flavours and personal service are the trademark. Do not miss this place when you are visiting Katong area in Singapore. You will love the finger licking food

After 9 years in China, this is as close to the truly authentic taste of a home cooked meal you can get in Singapore.I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but often stop by for takeaway. As a result I can only talk about the great food, and not the service.Highly recommended are the dumplings - fried are best, but the boiled pork and cabbage also excellent.They have a great range of vegetable dishes, although vegans beware, like all good Chinese food, most of it is cooked with pork. Ma po tofu, shredded potato, egg & tomato, cabbage and black fungus... all delicious.If you've got room, the beef noodles are a hearty adventure too

You will get here Chinese dishes from northern China, pretty rare in Singapore. We had different variations of noodle dishes. My absolute favorite was the oxtail soup. The celery and cashew nuts dish was excellent. We also had pork as well as vegetable dumplings. These are less refined than those found in Din Tai Fung. But they are authentic, exactly what you would get in northern China. My friend from northern China rated this restaurant better than the one she used to patronize in Shanghai

Don't let the title put you off, the food is worth it and the service is that bad you will laugh. If you speak Chinese you are probably fine, but if not be prepared to be ignored and given a good dose of spite and resentment (exactly how my wife cooks). That said you will eventually get served and the food is great. To top it off the interior decoration is suitable horrific. Been going there almost every week since the place opened over 10 years ago. Go on we all need abuse occasionally

Most Chinese restaurants in Singapore serve cuisine from the south of China and usually modified to southeast Asian tastes. This place serves relatively authentic north-east Chinese cuisine, although admittedly not as spicy was you would find in mainland China itself. They've recently rebranded themselves "Tall Girl Cuisine" on some of their signage (owing to the height of the owner who comes from a family of basketball players!), but the old "Eastern & Northern Dumpling Restaurant" name is still there on some of the signs

Everything ordered was delicious and very authentic tasting. Oxtail noodle soup was tasty and the few pieces of oxtail were meaty but not mushy. The pork "pizza pie" was hot and greasy, but ain't complaining. We knew what we were getting into ordering something fried. The xiao long bao dumplings had a thicker skin than I prefer but the filling was pork'ilicious. It came 4 to an order. The jajyang mein was my favorite because it was simple, balanced, and noodles were light. Not sure what "Tall Girl Cuisine" is but as we were dining, this tall, young lady walked in and proceeded to dine at the next table over. The staff brought food and a stack of mail to her. She appeared to be the owner, or somehow related. The walls of the restaurant were decked out with pictures of famous Asian basketball players. Apparently, the restaurant is owned by some famous basketball players from China. And the tall, young lady was their daughter. Interesting ...Great food, clean restaurant, and reasonably priced

premise - simple and nothing to shout about but full AC so that's goodlocation - along East Coast Road, carpark can be a painstaff - crap service, non attentive (thank God food is awesome)food - very good and very affordable. forget Din Tai Fung!!!! the Xiao Long Bao is WAY better here!!!crowd - we were early so it was empty but mainly familiesverdict - personally, the service is typical crap Mainland Chinese service (sorry but this is heartfelt and not a slur) food is VERY GOOD!!! price is VERY AFFORDABLE!! get everything in the menu if you ask me as it is really wholesome. ignore the bad service and just enjoy the food with the family after which you will end up smelling not so nice due to the bad ventilation of the resto. REASONS WHY I FEEL THAT THIS RESTO STILL DESERVES A 4 STAR RATING IS DUE TO ITS CHEAP COST AND AWESOME FOO
