Quantity is not sufficient to make it a full meal
Rayta is just waste

Excellent biryani! I’ve eaten biryani in many Indian restaurants but Bismillah Biryani at Dunlop Street is really the best! The mutton biryani is to die for with tender meat. Delicious!
5
I went to this restaurant because the reviews seemed good and I was craving for a nice Indian briyani. The location is excellent as it is in a shop house a minute walk from two different mrt stations. The restaurant itself is very simple but not run down. I ordered chicken briyani which was served a few minutes after ordering (I was there off-peak). I have to say, the dish is up to the standards the reviews suggest. Excellent. It doesn't have any dal or gravy served with it, which may be disappointing to some people used to the Malaysian briyani commonly served in Singapore, but real Indian briyani is not served with those. The dish still avoids being dry. The only bad thing I can say is that the raita is too salty. I would

I generally find food in Singapore is kind of bland and lack of authentic flavor until I try out the haleem at Bismillah. The combination of flavors which are spicy, meaty, crunchy and fulfilling in one simple dish is not easy to find anywhere. This is the staple food which I can have every week and i find the cooking best at Bismillah. The rest are non exceptional. I will always come back here for haleem!
1
Used to love going to the place, but the quality of food has really gone down. The prices have gone up, not too bad, but atleast that should have been accompanied by improved or atleast the same quality of food. Unfortunately not the case. Chicken was very dry and rice not flavorful and almost felt stale.

One of the best mutton biryanis I have eaten in singapore...the spices are well balanced ...it's not greasy and neither r there any colours added...the mutton is extremely tender and the accompanying mint raita adds it's subtle flavour....I prefer to parcel it and enjoy it at leisure at home ..at $15 per plate ..it's worth i
2
A very average biryani and definitely cant be the best of singapore. The rice was pretty dry and lacked any aroma whatsoever. The place was dull but the service was prompt. Having ignored the setup, the 2 stars are purely given based on the taste which was dry and bland. Overall a very disappointing biryani
5
This is one of those whole in d wall places ,you probably would not think of going in ,unless someone had told you about it,well now that I️ have ,you can try it.I️ definitely would go back ,I️ have had good biryanis before but this one is Awesome,I️ had the Mutton biryani ,it was sooo good ,the mutton was juicy and cooked to perfection,very tender.;the rice had just the right amount of spices and it wasn’t oily at all .The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the place could use an update and a good scrub ,but the food totally made up for the run down placeThe staff was nice.I️ would definitely go back
1
Really disappointed, as previous review made special visit due to Michelin star rating but have no idea how that was achieved.Had a veg biryani and a chicken biryani and although there was a lot of rice ,it was boring ,very little taste and not able to get any ‘sauce’The restaurant has relocated too not on Dunlop street and not in a very nice area if you are just females on your own.Really don’t even bother
1
Agreed. It was horrible. Rice was dry, spices over dose. Peppercorns not crushed but simply thrown in. Mutton was tasteless though soft.
Tekka market briyani would have tasted better for just $5.
Very disappointing!
2
We went to the Bismillah Biryani on the strength of the recommendation write up on a tour guide. The restaurant is basic to say the least and while the service was quick the biryani 's we received were not to the standard we've eaten in other places. There was more bone than meat in the biryani which gave us cause to wonder at the reputed michelin star award for the best "hawker food" in Singapore.Definitely not up to standard
4
I’m no expert, but I loved it. They have a great menu, lamb shanks, kidd, double kidd (wow - must be kidding me)But by the time we got there, they only had chicken. I enjoyed mine and half of my wife’s(I know that’s bad). One word of caution - there’s lots of bone in the chickenReally looking forward to trying a Kidd.
2
I was fortunate to go after lunchtime and had no problems finding a seat.The biryani mutton portion was huge, rice was flavourful but mutton was chunky and tough. Im not an expert on biryani but I like my mutton in biryani soft and moist.Personally I would not rate it the best. It was tough to chew and I just left it as that. I did see a few Singaporean Chinese office workers leave, after eating with packs to bring back. Another Singaporean Chinese friend did comment he thinks they're the best.It was not my experience. I have since found a biryani stall which I like
5
I see some mixed reviews, so we may have been lucky, else they have cleaned up their reliability. The flavours, spices, rice and meat were all perfect. And we loved the atmosphere.Was an excellent meal - would come again easily, but of course there are so many great restaurants in Singapore. I'm sure though, that I will be back to Bismillah Biryan
3
Have been wanting to try this place since I heard of their Michelin mention. Ordered a fish bryani to takeaway and found the $12 portion small and without the usual sides of acar and curry. Test was good, flavourful and not to strong. Rice was fluffy.
3
i've been to the dunlop street biryani shall more than 5 times for lunch with friends/family and i find that the biryani is becoming more inconsistent. when i first started coming here (about a year ago) i thought the biryani was absolutely delicious - good mix of spices, rice and really moist meat.however, over the last 3 months i've been about three times and each time, i found something to be lacking. either the rice is WAY to spicy, or too dry, or lacking in flavor or the meat too dry. i know they expanded their business and started another restaurant a couple of months ago. i can't help but feel that the standard dropped perhaps because another chef is cooking the biryani. i feedback to the owner/manager and all he said was that the person "scooping" the biryani did not have the skill, which i found was a poor excuse.previously i would have recommended the biryani as it was really good. now, i'm not sure if i'd go back because for such a high price of their biryani, i would not want to get dry meat nor flavourless rice
5
Easy to find, just get into MRT to the downtown line, alight in Rochor. The stall located in Dunlop St. You won't missed the big signage.This dish intended not served with gravy. But the taste is really mouthful. They give you big portion and amazingly even my wife finished her biryani with no single rice.The rice so soft. Just delicious
1
Happen to be in Serangoon road today & decided to buy this much talked about biryani. Packed a few mutton and chicken biryanis and was truly excited to take a bite. My tastebuds were unprepared for the disappointment that followed, especially since this restaurant was given a michelin star. The rice and meat were both so dry that it tasted like yesterday's leftovers ! I ended up going out to buy some curry to help moisten the meal a little. I've had superb dum biryanis in and out of Singapore and this is one of the, if not worst, biryanis my family and I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. It is quite pricy on top of that. If this is the quality of what a michelin starred restaurant serves, I am never stepping into another one. There are many other places that serve great tasting dum biryanis in Singapore so for anyone reading this review, please spend your money elsewhere
1
This was the 3rd time I had been here, it is very expensive @ $15 but I (used to) think they could charge because of the quality of the mutton.Today was very different, the biryani was horrible, so much fat I would say the pile of fat left on my plate was 50% of the mutton.I will not be back, you can get much better than this for $5 = 1/3 of the price of here
3
This place was hyped as having the best biryani. It was okay and certainly not worth what we paid. No real menu here, you simply have a choice of lamb, chicken or veg. I've had much better biryani in Los Angeles and cheaper too.
1
Michelin Star?
Seriously tasted like any typical coffeeshop briyani.
$15 wasted.
Rather go elsewhere.
4
The restaurant makes authentic and delicious Biryani, the way it is done in the sub-continent. Kebabs are reasonably good but chicken tikka is excellent.
3
Briyani is too expensive and the taste is just ok. Rice was bit dry, no gravy served.
I would rather suggest briyani shops at tekka market much better interms of taste & price.
3
The taste of the food was good but restaurant's ventilation could be improved. Service was prompt, though.
5
This is just the place to go if you like muton/goat and spicy food.Yes, the restaurant is not super fancy and the menu is limited but the food is just the bomb!Go there, eat fast, get a lassi and be happy!For me just a must every time i am in Singspore

Honestly, comparing the biryani from Bismillah to the Malaysian "nasi briyani" is not fair. They are two very different styles of making biryani. Bismillah hits the spot when it comes to "genuine" biryani. This is what it SHOULD taste like, and as someone who's eaten biryani in Hyderabad, India - I can vouch that you will not be disappointed by the biryani here, IF AND ONLY IF: 1. You go there before 9 pm - coz honestly, after 9, most of their good stuff has run out and whatever is left just doesn't taste the same. 2. You go there for the food, not for the service. Seriously, take a look at the place. Are you really expecting 5 star service? The guys running it are not "gracious hosts" but they aren't rude either! 3. You eat their "haleem". No words for this dish - they do it AMAZINGLY well. I eat here regularly, and to cut out the service aspect, I just use ubereats to get it at home :D Again - I have to stress - don't expect an oily curry to go along with this biryani, its meant to be had just by itself, and it tastes the way Biryani should taste
2
Let's be fair - The food is good. Truth be told, you don't get good biryani, genuine 'biryani' in Singapore. This is closest to what you get in Muslim households in Pakistan, North India. It's got nice aroma, meat is well cooked and isn't full of 'roghan'. Worst part - Service isn't as good as their biryani. Their staff, Shakeel is impolite and rude. As a visiting tourist if you ask him for gravy, he turns the heat on you. When you visit with family, they refuse food when you are right at their door (If you truly wanted to retain customers you could have offered them to try your kulfi which is good too) - They had a person named Rehan earlier who was courteous and nice

We decided to have a nice dinner on Hari Raya day & headed to this place. Unfortunately, it was 9pm ( and they close dinner at 9),so the person directed us to another outlet of the same franchise on the main road. We were the only customers there at that place & some haleem to start with. There was only one person who was taking the order and serving so we patiently waited. When he came over with baleen, we placed our order for the biryani and kebabs asking him first if they were available. After that, we waited patiently as two more tables got filled up. But after about more than half an hour, the person served the table next to us who came in much after us and we still waited for our food. Then, he packed some online delivery etc and completely ignored us.After sometime, he served the kebabs to that table and those people were surprised that they didn't order it but continued eating. Finally, when we enquired from the person he denied us placing any order at all and when we countered him he said that the food we ordered isn't available. He didn't say anything like that when we had placed the order and he was arguing with us instead of apologising for it. It was such a bummer and we just left after paying for the food. Most of the places had shut down for dinner by then and our mood was completely spoilt by this person on a festive day!:
4
I cook briyani as same as this but to get it perfect everytime is really a skill especially you cant get the same quality of meet everytime but this is one place which ensures your meat is tender and juicy always. Briyani is 5 star but the place in terms of looks and hygiene level is only 4 sta
4
Although the place may look a bit rundown, the biriyani and shami kebabs were superb. Hyderabadi style. Not very spicy but really authentic taste. Given the prices, I would like the place to be done up a bit more. Hence the 4 star rating.
4
If you like to have delicious biriyani in Singapore, you may try this restaurant once. The price may not be very cheap ( usually 8-10 sgd for biriyani) but you will enjoy the food, expecially biriyani, halim and fruit kulfi.
5
We had the baby lamb biryani and the kulfi. Quick service in a no nonsense way. The taste was heavenly! And the kulfi was not to be taken lightly either. Highly recommend!
2
Few friends planned to have a dinner at bismillah two weeks ago, I had heard a lot about the food here but the biryani for me was absolutely a disaster, alarmist cold and no rich Flavours. I have had much better ones in singapore.
4
Very fragrant and well cooked barayani. It's worth very cents! Don't order other dishes though. We ordered chicken and hugely disappointed. We were expecting tasty chicken we had with barayani but it's totally different...
3
Visited for lunch, based on recommendation in Lonely Planet. Ordered chicken and mutton biryani which was served very quickly as there were few customers. Serve was quite large but delicious so was able to eat it all!! Chicken was Ok; mutton very tender and tasty though rice a little oily. Only slightly spicy; addition of raita definitely added flavour. Recommend for a change from hawker food / food courts etc
3
I have visited this place twice. Once before the Bib was awarded and the second time after that. The decor and furniture improved after the Bib award but it was still the run down corner shop..... very quaint in the context of well groomed Singapore. This is dry dum briyani and I recall that on my first visit more than 2 years ago, there was a sign stating that they serve briyani without curry gravy. It was OK by me as the aromatic spices made up for it but Singaporeans do generally like that saucer of accompanying gravy. I guess this is what northern style briyani was about. At $14 per plate then, it was pricey by Singapore standards given the setting and even with the 2 pieces of tender mutton. Fast forward to post Bib award.... I went for the $22 a plate kid meat version accompanied by a colleague. The rice had become somewhat greasy and not as enjoyable as before but the restaurant was noticeably more crowded! In my opinion, the food quality has gone from a 4/5 to 3/5 but die hard fans will probably disagree with me.
3
Wanted to try a Michelin Star restaurant. With great expectation, went to Bismillah Biryani. But food was a disappointment. It was so ordinary. In fact less than ordinary as there is no gravy provided, no veg pickles provided. When I asked for a packed meal, it was packed in an ordinary plastic ware. I wonder who had graded them as Michelin star as Locals will immediately suggest a better place for Biryani in Singapore. The price was expensive. Chicken biryani for $8.50 Mutton biryani for $12.50 and Fish biryani $15!!
4
Actually amazing spices and full of flavor, but not spicy hot, just smart use of exciting and exotic fresh spicesThe tandoori chicken was too salty , I would not order againThe price was very reasonable and the place is not fancy at all, I think this is a good deal in Singapore
5
I came here following a recommendation by a colleague. I visited with my wife, in laws and 2 year old daughter and the biryani was absolutely brilliant, one of the best I have had, even considering my regular work trips to India. Easy to find and access from the Rochor station, I would highly recommend a visit
4
It's worth a trip into Little India to get a completely different view of Singapore. While there you can't go wrong at Bismillah Biryani. The menu is very limited. There are several biryanis, some meat, and dessert. It's very inexpensive and very tasty. No frills.
4
This restaurant is recommended by the staff of the hotel where we stayed. Glad we went there and tried their food. It was really good.
3
Good menu selection. We had the Vegetarian Biryani and enjoyed the authentic flavours. Only downsides are the prices considering it's location and the push for customers not to linger after their meal.
4
Although this place was recommended to me based on their biryani, i found the vegetarian and meat biryani a little bland but still very nice. The real discovery here was the haleem which was really good!!The interior is not fancy at all, very basic, but dont let that put you off. Yummy food.RegardsOma
5
Flavourful Veg Biryani. You can feel the riot of spices in the mouth- star aniseed, Bay leaf to start with, topped with crunchy deep fried onions. They serve the Veg Biryani here with their signature mango pickle. The fresh mint-curd blend that accompanies the Biryani is just perfect. Finish off with a 'Firni' or the 'Kulfi' to die for
3
Summary: Out of 10, the scores are;Food - 4Service - 4Ambience - 4Value for money - 4We had baby goat/lamb briyani, chicken briyani and tandoori chicken. The briyani rice was properly spiced and seasoned. However, there were a lot of hard particles in the rice such as over cooked onions, cardamon and cloves. The lamb and chicken were well seasoned and spiced. Overall, everything was over salted.The ambience and service reminded one of the past. The place had an air of old times. Seemed to have grease every where.
3
First time at Bismillah Briyani and it was a disappointment. I chose the baby goat biryani and was shocked to recieve small chunks of meat, mostly bones. I had to request thrice to the waiter to talk to the manager and at third attempt she gave me some extra meat with no charges.I still dont think it is worth $15
4
I had a mutton biryani while my wife had the veggie version. Both tastes good, just the right amount of spiciness with many different flavors to discover with every bite. What I particularly like was that is was not greasy and overly moist. Price wise not cheap for the area but then again we came for quality and that's what we got
4
Had the double mutton briyani, when the plate arrives it looks almost normal . Was thinking to myself is that it? However, the first bite changed the whole thing. The briyani was just superb . It was flavourful, spicy and authentic tasting ! The mutton was tender and just melt in the mouth. Should see the length of the basmati rice by far the longest grain I've seen ! Just on the down side for $20 per pop I think it could have come with some veg like acar or paceri or a side salad with papadom or something .  Ambience ? Hardly anyit look like it could do with some uplifting ! Hence to conclude , far one of the better ones out there but the pricing was too steep .
1
I just did a take out of 2 sets of mutton dum biriyani and 1 chicken biryani an hour ago. It's supposed to be dum - which means the flavour will be cooked in - it should be slightly moist. This is the opposite.It is biryani (standard coffee shop coloured rice) with pieces of dry chicken and dry mutton put together. Absolute disappointment- dry - flavourless and tasteless. I can't figure out how this place got a high rating at all. A dum mutton briyani cost 15 per packet. It's the standard plastic container that's used in Singapore. Small portion size by Singapore Indian food standards. Chicken biriyani was 8.50. This is a disappointment. Alternatives are tekka market sells much better biriyani than this. Certainly Anjappar, Banana Leaf Appollo (if you can get past the lack of service) and Muthus serve fabulous dum biriyanis
5
Mutton biryani is simply superb, surged with love by the owner Usman, who is quite an interesting guy to engage with!
4
I ordered just the chicken biryani and it was amazing. Very delicious, lots of flavour, chicken was tender and juicy, very nice. Beware it was very spicy though! The place is definitely humble, simple. Service was no highlight but still efficient.
4
nice mutton biryani.
crowded during lunch time
but at $15. a tad expensive
the icecream yellow dessert thingy was good.
4
Came here for the first time earlier in the week for lunch. I opted for the mutton biryani whilst my friend chose chicken. Quite decent, although lacking a side plate with some curds and chutney. Tempted to revisit.
1
I got both chicken and mutton biryani. Taste is too bad, too much hyped and overpriced. They used to serve nice biryani couple of years back. $15 for a biryani with no proper taste is worthless.
4
The most important part: the food was incredibly delicious. So flavorful, and the chicken was very tender. FYI they are cash only. That was a surprise. Also, the bathroom is "traditional" not "Western". There was no soap or hand dryer. So if you've been walking around and need to use the facility, it isn't the most welcome sight. Come prepared with hand sanitizer and tissues. Finally, no air conditioning here. If you're temperature sensitive, get it to go and enjoy at your hotel.
5
As they say the best food is found not in a fine dining place but at a small food shop tucked away in some alley! Thats completely true for Bismillah Biryani. Digitally slow cooked dum biryani is delicious and mouth watering. Every cent you spent on it is completely worth it. Also try their range of kebabs. A big thumbs up!
1
Highly over rated!! The briyani rice has too much of the hard inedible spices like cloves, star anise that is mixed with the rice. The chicken was dry and there is no taste of flavours that should be infused inside the meat with the dum method of cooking briyani. We also ordered the tandoori chicken and it was a small portion of miserable dry chicken. There are many places in Singapore where you can get better briyani, any hawker center would be better. Compared to places like Tekka market briyani or Islamic Restaurant this would be a 1/10 compared to a 9/10
5
Unassuming from the outside but would highly recommend to anyone in Singapore. The sign humbly says they "probably" have the best biryani in the world but it's DEFINITELY the best. Don't worry about the service or the ambiance, you're going here for the food and the experience. Not hard to find and would 100% return on my next trip to Singapore. What a find
4
We went there for the biriyani on a foodie's recommendation. We ordered mutton dum biriyani, tandoori chicken, shammi kabab and kulfi.We liked the biriyani but wouldn't give it a top rating. We prefer a lighter but more fragrant dum biriyani when we go for the North Indian / Pakistani version. We felt the aromatic spices had been used just a touch more than we would have liked. The shammi kababs were good. The ground meat was fine but not mushy. The spice was also robust but not overpowering. Kulfi also made the cut, though the portion was a bit too small to satisfy.The tandoori chicken was disappointing, lacking the subtlety of the best versions, while not being as moist as some we've had.Service was efficient; not unfriendly but matter-of-fact. Definitely nothing to complain about. The ambience was basic and space tight, but the place was clean,Overall, worth trying the biriyani out, as we seem to be in a minority of folk who don't rate it tops. We liked Bismillah's mutton biriyani, but not enough to go out of the way to try it again
3
Yes, good and tasty biryani as told in the Lonely Planet guidebook, but the place really lacks soul and is a bit run down. Service is very quick but honestly, not very friendly.
4
Except for ambience (which is more of a cheap-eats place), the food is excellent, with Biryanis and desserts (Mishti Doi, Kulfi and Phirni) are to die for. Reasonably priced too (Mutton- SGD 15, Chicken- 10-12 SGD).
3
Grumpy service, expensive food and just average biryani. There are many better dum biryani outlets in Singapore
4
Best muslim briyani in singapore, Nice small place. Not class and relax place. You can go for that food taste.
4
Good value of money, I order one chicken nasi brayani with the price 8.50 only, the environment is clean, the owner service is good, recommend by lovely plannet.Just wonder where I should take the dinner and I found them by trip advisor with the rate 4 star.Strongly recommend to the rice lover
4
Don't get deceived by the ambience of this one shop restaurant in a street corner of little India: I go to this place because I like talking to the owner and also like the food specially biryani, haleem and chicken chops. OK no way closer to the Hyderabadi Biryani but has its own taste. You can SMS the owner to book your Biryani else you may not get it some time.The restaurant has limited seating and is very basic. Highly Recommended
3
This place is ok. I feel as though it's a little overpriced. The place is clean but maybe not as clean as an American restaurant but it's still good enough. I certainly didn't feel like it was dirty like some other reviews. They were a little too harsh.The mutton briyani was ok. It has so many spices in it that it was just a little too much. Service was just fine. We sat down, ordered within a minute, got our food within 5 minutes, and paid our bill about 10 minutes later. So easy. Paid $15 and split the dish with my wife. I'm glad we did this because we weren't thrilled with this dish.I chose this place based upon a review from a well known author in Singapore. His other recommendations have been good but I just can't agree with this one. It's just an ok place. I wouldn't tell one of my friends to go here but the place is ok
3
We were going to give this place a miss, but at the last minute decided to just try it out. It was average. We were not given a menu, just had to look at the menu at the entrance of the restaurant. The server was quick to our table and delivered the mutton biryani quickly. For SGD $15, the serving was lots of biryani but just a couple bony pieces of mutton. A little expensive for the amount of food. The restaurant was small but for dinner at 7pm, there was plenty of seats and the place appeared clean
5
If you are looking for the most authentic Dum Biryani, the likes of which you will get in Pakistan or India, you will have to miss most of the local Singapore versions of biryani and head to Bismillah Biryani. The biryani is cooked in the traditional style with the final step being the compulsory layering of meat and rice for the unmistakable 'Dum'.The flavours and spices of this version of Biryani are more focused on the deep, heavy flavours, more akin to the Sindhi Biryani style rather than the lighter, tangier flavours and spices of the Bombay Biryani or the more balanced (and more famous) flavours of the Hyderabadi Biryani.Both their chicken and mutton biryani is excellent. On some days they serve 'baby goat' meat biryani which is more expensive than the normal mutton biryani. Other side dishes which are a must try (if available) are the Shaami Kebabs, Chappli Kebabs and the Kulfi.Service can be patchy at times and the setting is basic but clean. The owner, Arif, is friendly on good days and indifferent on bad days. But if your focus is on the food, you will rarely go away dissatisfied
4
While backpacking, holding on to the lonely planet copy, i travelled in MRT and rode buses and walked for miles (:)) to reach this small biriyani place which the book promised was the best biriyani in Singapore. The place was a small dingy one.The food was cheap. But when tasted, it was worth all the traveling.. Biriyani and cutlet were delicious.. Was worth the adventure..Defenitely recommend this place if you visit Little India
4
Food is probably the best outside India. At least if biryani is what you are looking for. .. for me this place alone was good enough reason for visiting Little India
5
We walked up to the place and thought ..... really? Sure doesn't look like much. But the biryani is just awesome . Had the chicken and mutton. Very tasty and a large helping. Well worth the visit - have every intention of going back.
4
Bismillah is a simple and shabby place. The owners and the wait staff are grumpy. They don't serve any accompaniments with their biriyani, but boy do they a mean biriyani. You can choose between lamb, chicken and fish biriyani and all of them are equally good. Be sure to be early. They run out pretty fast
4
Came here on the recommendation of getting the best Buriyani in Singapore.  Not maybe as celubrious as we expected more of an authentic experience you might say. Basic no frills but clean with good nutritious  food  We were the only tourists here which tells it's own story. The Byriani?  Excellent as was the mango lassi.  Worth a visit while you are in Little India. 
4
I never considered myself that much of an aficionado of biryani until I came to Singapore, but tried it several times, and now almost prefer it to heavier curry dishes. I recommend the mutton biryani. It's hot, but order a Mango lassi to drink. It's simple surroundings, but as I discovered, some of the best places in Singapore to eat are in the most utilitarian locations
2
I do not know what the hype is. The biryani quality is average. It's a rundown store, no air conditioning. Just fans when Singapore's average temperature is between 30-35 degrees. I had the goat biryani however the quality was average/ below average. The rice were hard, the sauce was horrible. Overall experience was below average.
5
Being disappointed with the quality and taste of biriyani in Singapore, I'm so happy and damn sure to say you cannot find a better biriyani in Singapore. Loaded with real "spices" (not the red color and chilli), real chicken cooked with rice, soft and well marinated... Its a treat for tastebuds.
4
The place is located on the Jalan Besar side of Serangoon. Non aircon. Small. But do they serve authentic biryani dump. All the tenderness in the chicken comes out due to the correct way of cooking in the rice. Spices can be tasted and not overwhelming. They were other condiments within the rice which somehow balances the whole dish and rice. Priced at $8.50, this is really a must try. I was told that the lamb version is double the price. The chicken is suffice though
4
My wife and I called in for a spot of lunch. The only westerners in a packed cafe type room but that didn't matter, we where there for the Chicken Biryani and it didn't dissapoint. There isn't a menu, you just eat what the chef is cooking that day. Generous sized portions also. Well worth a visit
5
Never had such tasty briyani anywhere in Singapore. Available varieties are only chicken briyani and mutton briyani and a few desserts. It's a very small shop with no ac. But the mutton briyani and kulfi gives a heavenly taste. If you are bored of bland briyani 's in Singapore head to little India.
4
Very good chicken BIRYANI
Nice quick lunch
Only BIRYANI and Lasi ( Laban )
Good service and great food
Friendly staff
5
Tried the chicken biryani (take away). It was perfectly spiced and the chicken was so tender and well cooked. Portion size is sufficient for a single person. Raita and kulfi were also good. This is one amazing biryani !
4
I had my craving for Nasi Biryani today and my first thought was Islamic or Ali Nacha Dum Biryani in Tanjong Pagar. On my way, i just googled biryani and came up with Bismillah Biryani in Dunlop street and since it is convenient, I decided to eat there. The biryani proved to be very delicious but the price was not. S$15.00 for the plate of dum biryani without dachar to go along is expensive however, the serving can be shared by two as it was good for two. I struggled to finished just 2/3 of the biryani. There are other dum biryani which is as good but at a lower price elsewhere!
5
This is the go-to for briyani for my Indian and Pakistani friends. Authentic favors from a chef who cares about delivering a top shelf product. Both the lamb and chicken briyani are excellent as is the kulfi for dessertHighly recommended for those visiting Little India - but go early because they tend to sellout every day by mid evenin
2
The Biryani may be authentic, but it tastes average. The atmosphere is not very inviting with open air to the street, the restaurant is not air conditioned with only fan. The menu is very limited, with only chicken or lamb, same for the kebab. When we were there, the restaurant is empty, what attracted us was probably the old sign review out the front by Travel Channel and Anthony Bourdain. If it wasn't for that we probably wouldn't have gone in. Having tried that now, I'd probably give it a miss. $32 for two chicken Biryani and one chicken kebab. I've tried better Biryani elsewhere. They don't even serve beer and you're not even allowed to BYO. Sitting is a hot restaurant with no AC and they don't serve cold beer would be enough to put you off from coming in, had we knew before we order we'd probably have gone elsewhere

I been here a few weeks ago and I had a craving over the weekend, so I came by for lunch. I last had the baby lamb biryani. So this time round, I ordered the Chicken Briyani, which cost $8.50.I also had the Mango Lassi: $4. This was vacuum sealed in a plastic cup, just like bubble tea. To end, I had the Kulfi: $2.50. This was a small cup with an ice cream stick stuck on one end. Pull the ice cream out from the cup and enjoy. It’s packed with crushed pistachio nuts at the top and the middle of the ice cream. The kulfi is milky in taste and reminds me of condensed milk. A good meal and I enjoyed it a lot

You want Biryani and that's what you get. No side dishes, gravy, papadums etc. The lamb and chicken melts in your mouth and the flavour of the meat permeates every grain. No need for any condiments. I don't eat Biryani that often, maybe twice a month so even with a hefty price tag at S$15 a plate for the lamb, I can be assured of the real deal

They claim to have the best biriyani in Singapore. I have had better biriyanis than what they serve. But it is definitely not the worst. It's a good dum biriyani preparation. I had chicken dum biriyani. The chicken was well cooked, the masala was perfect and overall it had the right aroma and taste for a good biriyani. I would surely visit again as it's a good value for money option.Ambiance is not good but the food which matters the most is good

My friend had casually mentioned about this nasi biryani that is very good and that the mutton biryani costs $15. I was intrigued but we just had lunch, so we couldn’t go check it out immediately. After a couple of weeks, I asked him out for lunch and suggested to visit this eatery. He promptly agreed. We headed over to this eatery, located at Little India – off Serangoon Road.It’s located in a corner non-descript shophouse. If my friend had not brought me here, I would have just walked past it.There were limited seats and they were packed. We managed to get a seat soon, as a table was just vacated. - Baby Goat/ Lamb Briyani: $15. This is cooked dum-briyani style where the meat is cooked in the rice. The meat is well marinated with herbs and spices and the flavour permeated to the biryani rice, which made it tasty. The meat is tender and tender. It pulls apart easily. The rice portion is generous and I was more than full after polishing off the whole plate. - Mango Lassi: $4. Served in pre-packed and sealed plastic container, just like bubble tea. Just head over to the fridge near the counter at the back and help yourself. They use normal plastic straws which cannot be poked into the plastic lid. So get a toothpick from the counter and poke a hole before inserting your straw in. Its mango flavoured. Nice and refreshing.I spent $19 for my meal. Overall, a good meal. This is definitely a good nasi biryani that you must try

The mutton and chicken were both delicious and authentic. The rice was slightly over done but the meat was very soft and very well cooked. They use quality ingredients and that shows in the results. The kulfi was fantastic. The place could be a little cleaner and it's not exactly cheap. Mutton 15 chicken 9 kulfi 2.

We went here for a Chicken Biryani and a Mango Lassi - both of which were yummy. However, within 2h of our visit both my wife and I felt ill. We lost an entire day suffering from all symptoms of food poison.

We went to this place hearing the reviews, taste is average, the staff are a little rude... Definitely not the best biryani is Singapore

Biryani lovers, This review is from someone who is crazy about Biryani, to the extent that I plan my holidays tied to the marriage season in India to satiate my crave for Dekh biryani. My recent visits to India for this were not very successful as I guess the old biryani masters are retired and the newbies cannot bring the old magic. I have always passed Dunlop street numerous times but never got a sense of this biryani shop there. The ambience has nothing to write about and the service is pretty much the same. But among all these cons, the taste and quality of Kids goat biryani that they serve overrides every negativity. The biryani is of a limited quantity and will not satiate people with huge hunger pangs. But the taste and the melting mutton pieces really make your day. Really love it. Now I am not too bothered about the marriage season in India as there is a serious and better alternative. To top it, they have their kulfi that is probably the best in Singapore as well but that is for an another day. Do mind that the pricing is above normal biryani standard for the ambience and service but for the taste that you get, it feels like a pittance. Don't get yourself bogged down by the reviews concerning price, ambience and service as for me, getting a good biryani beats all the pain of the negatives.

~A friend said this is the best place for Biryani and when I got there it really is, and there was a sign "Singapore's Best Dum Biryani" and that's prolly where the Best ends~Well first off the anticipation made the let down go to the basement. I added quite a bit more to create this mood, so lemme be more objective about this subjective topic of eating the best Biryani. After I posted about an average Biryani place, then I wondered where I could go for the best. Once I got this recommendation, I decided to walk from the office to 50 Dunlop Street, all 3.7km on foot. That should make it all the more satisfying right? WRONG! ikr~Walking from Sim Lim Tower across the road to Dunlop Street, GPS told me to walk up to Perak Road and it should be on the left going up North, it wasn't. Once at the cross road at Perak Raod it's across on the right opposite the Sandpiper Hotel (see photos)~It was 6pm on a Monday and it looked like it was closed for business (photoproof) except for the cheery and super happy grey bearded man seated outside who asked what I'd like to have. Usually a place like this will have all the food pre-cooked on display but there wasn't anything in front, so I was relieved when he said all the food is behind in the kitchen "phew" all the way!~Everything on the Menu is written on the chalkboard facing the street~They take Cash & NETS, no credit cards~Biryani is priced comparably with other places in Singapore~The receipt states "De' Pearl Corner Pte Ltd"~They are a split shift restaurant and are closed every Tuesday except if the Tuesday is a public holiday, yeah ikr!~No Gravy or Dalcha is served with their Biryani~Self Service Ice Water is available free flow no charge~Bismillah Fried Chicken is a favorite here but they had none this evening~Bismillah Kulfi is a favorite but I could not bring it back on foot without melting!~Bismillah Haleem is so yummy on the poster I could taste it too but too rich for me!~they seal prep lassi in the fridge so that's kinda cool~This is my first time here so I ordered AHEM Chicken Biryani, Lamb Biryani, Fish Biryani & 2 Shami Kebab (recommended by the younger guy) to go :)~the Dum Biryani is exactly spiced, a bit too dry for me and I did not like finding cloves and cardamom pods in the rice but many folks would ignore this tho~the Fish was really too dry and flaky, the lamb dry and tough, the chicken was the only good one among the 3~the Shami Kebab is very spicy, but really good I find the older gentleman such an excellent host but the food wasn't great for me that day :(Bottomline for Biryani, the best was a Malay Muslim stall in the canteen of my secondary school now gone, and the current one I go to I've never reviewed yet, stay tuned :

I'm at Bismillah at 50 Dunlop Street after planning for a few weeks to try Singapore's best dum bryani. I miss Hyderabad bryani. A plate of mutton bryani is $15. Personally I found the basmati rice a bit soggy and not fluffy. It's flavourful with all the spices. It's not the best I've eaten in Singapore and cannot be compared with that in Hyderabad.There's a mixture of races eating here: Chinese, Malay and Indians. Some leave with boxes packed to bring back. Even at 1230pm on Wed, I can find seats in this tiny shop house.

It's a fuss free restaurant where no paraphernalia is offered nor needed. The owner just like the restaurant itself is unpretentious, direct but passionate about his food quality. The chicken biriyani was awesome tender and evenly cooked full of aroma - the kooli was also very good. We went at 830 when they were left with two chicken biriyanis and one koolfi only which together cost us around sgd 25 - the next day I reached the restaurant at 8pm to try the mutton biriyani and the kebabs. Since biriyani is always a mutton speciality where chicken is a very poor second. But that day also the mutton biriyani was over I was left with chicken biriyani and shami kebab:-(. Have heard about their sgd 15 kid goat biriyani but probably it's next to impossible to try it unless u can't make it to them by 630 pm - that itself speaks volume about the quality and the rightly deserved arrogance which the restaurant is associated wit

We went to this place during office hours on weekdays .As expected place was very crowded, understandably due to office lunch time hours and bustling location little india.We waited for our turn and after some time we got one table with left over food , we asked the owner to clean up the table , to our dismay he replied in not so pleasant manner and refused to clean up the mess, telling us that he is busy and he can only serve us biryani.Overall experience not good!!

I am a big time biriyani lover and enjoy different kinds of biriyani. I went to this place to relish my taste buds but it was shockingly disappointing after all the hype I heard of. The service was third class : I don't know what is with the attitude of the server/owner, he doesn't even wait for 2 secs or look at you when you place an order, he is literally running even though the restaurant was not at all crowded on the weekend I visited. Of course it is not an fancy restaurant, but I am still wondering why he charges that price for the biriyani that tastes like nothing (more about the biriyani in the later section), no air conditioning .... dirty chairs and tables . There are so many similar restuarants which don't have a aesthetic feel but serve tasty food with reasonable pricing, I will still go with them for the sake of taste.Now the BIRIYANI : It has a huge amount of dalda (hydrogenated vegetable oil) , hardly any spices which are the real flavor of biriyani, not a good quality biriyani rice with zero fragrance and texture completely screwed. The only think which was atleast acceptable was the tender mutton. This was the first time I couldn't finish the entire plate of biriyani inspite of feeling hungry.This taste of biriyani did not belong to any orogin of indian state- neither hyderabadi, Bangalore, cheenai,.... nor north india. I wonder how our indian biriyani is potrayed wrongly to the outside world.Still in search of authentic INDIAN BIRIYANI in Singapore

Good biryani is hard to find, being a vegetarian just makes it harder. Fair warning: The place does not have the best looking decor and its an out of the way. It is however in the Lonely planet guide.3 of us went there for dinner, we had to pre-order the Veg biryani a day in advance, it was ready and waiting for us at the time we specified. At first, I was a little skeptical if the food was worth all the hype, 2 spoons of the biryani and all doubts were cleared. It was amazing, the spice, bitterness of the biryani with the sweetness of the gravy was perfect. The mango lassi was also very good. Its not cheap, but well worth the price. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good biryani. Also worth noting, the cook/owner is extremely knowledgeable and loves to get feedback, good or bad
3
This is a no nonsense restaurant. I came here to try the biryani as they were recommended in the lonely planet book. Most of the other diners were westerners when I came at 7.30 pm at night.The decor did make me reconsider but I sat myself down and hoped for the best.I asked to see a menu but the waiter patiently told me i could choose chicken or goat biryani. I chose the goat. Plentiful serve with lots of meat. Spicy rice so may not suit everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it. It cost me $15 for the meal which surprised me. I thought it would be a lot less than that, but to be fair I never asked for the price when i ordered.I did leave wondering whether I had paid some inflated foreigner price, but the receipt said $15 and many other posts confirm the same.Basically : nice meal, unpleasant decor and overpriced. I am no aficionado of biryani but I liked it.
4
Soft fluffly rice, smokey flavored chicken and the kulfi. You NEED this Kulfi in your life. Its highly priced at $5 but this is a kulfi to be talked about.
I did find the rice a little spicy for my liking though
4
Went here after reading about it in the lonely planet guide, my husband and I both had the Goat Biryani. It was very good and well worth the trip to little India.

I've taken a lot of my friends here and am extremely fond of this place. For 8.50 SGD a plate for the Chicken Biryani & 9 SGD a plate for the Mutton Biryani, is a steal for the generous quantity that is served! The Kid Goat Biryani at 15 SGD though is my all time favourite. The meat is so delicious & the spices blend in beautifully to great a very fragrant Biryani indeed.The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish & that is also why that most of the time the owners runs out of Biryani since he gets busy with a lot of orders for this dish. If you want to truly enjoy this dish at Bismillah, go at an off time, such as, late for lunch or early for dinner. :)... He shuts earlier than his usual time before often he runs out of Biryani - his food is that good.More importantly, this is as authentic a dish as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Try & ask him why the Biryani at other places is different & I'm sure the owner & chef - the highly articulate & humourous...Arif bhai will indulge you in a long chat on what real Biryani is - unless you piss him off first.Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner/chef Arif bhai cooks it. Biryani is almost always eaten at celebrations & family gatherings & that is what makes it such a special dish. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food. My suggestions if you're going here - Make you sure chat up with the owner if you visit the next time, he's a wonderful gent with a well informed viewpoint on food & life...& throbbing passion for what he does.Go early in order to not be disappointed. Even better if you make a call before going with a group & reserve your plates. Once he gets to know you, you can text him too to place your order & reserve your plates.Don't get put off by the simple & fuss free interiors of this place. Some of the chefs at Fullerton go here once their shift is up & that is testimony to how good the food is. Don't forget to try the Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) priced at 2.50 SGD... once you're done with the Biryani.Visit the POW Hostel for a cold beer after you've had that Biryani to wash it all down

This was another place I have heard about biryani but to our disappointed it just failed. No where I can rate it as more than an average biryani.Highly over priced for the plate $15 I didn't get the taste of flavours in every bite. Quite spicy making it not a flavorful plate to enjoy. Ambience is not where you can take anyone to visit along. Don't think going to make a trip again to this place
4
We are biryani lovers and haven't found our favourite until we visited Bismillah's. The owner mentioned that the biryani is digitally cooked and not on fire hence every grain of rice and meat is cooked perfectly. The meat just falls off the bone. Yes expensive but surely will keep u coming back.
3
Bismillah has been touted as the best biryani restaurant in Singapore. Their biryani is good, especially the mutton biryani but in my opinion it is not good enough to be called the best in Singapore. It is also expensive when compared to other biryani places, costing SGD$15 per plate compared to about SGD$5 in other places. Their biryani came with a plate of yogurt.Overall, it is worth a try but I wouldn't return for a second time
4
We enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. Clearly not an upmarket place but full of afficionados there to enjoy the excellent dum briyanis, which was spicy and full of flavour. Unlike some other reviews, we felt that the meat portion of the goat/mutton briyani was more than sufficient and was moist and succulent. The lassi was a bit too rich but the kulfi was a nice end to the meal. We would certainly go back again
1
My Wife is the biggest Biryani fan I know and we tried a few Biryani places in Singapore, some of them were ok and some of them not so ok. We read great reviews about Bismillah on Trip Advisor and decided to try it for ourselves.But to our disappoint the Biryani was very average and so was the restaurant. The quantity was not very much and so was the quantity of the mutton in the Biryani. But the Biryani was sold at the an extravagant price. It is definitely not worth the trip in my book
1
This shop is nothing but extravagant now a days . Biryani is simply over priced which comes with a piece of potatoe to cover up the quantity of mutton.. in short not worth visting .. not authentic in taste..By the way customer has to inform the owner via message to reserve the Biryani what I feel just a show off by the owner
4
I tried Veg and Chicken Biryani here with my teammates . The taste is authentic and price wise very reasonable. The Biryani was fresh and nicely cooked .The only issue is finding this place as first time it will definitely takes time to reach here. The ambience can be improved in this restaurant
5
I am a maaive foodie and I must say this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten! Chicken biryani and kulfi... Mmmmmmmm
4
You should not miss out Bismillah Briyani (only mutton) if you are visiting Little India. Must Have even better than any dam biryani that I had back in Pakistan.
4
Taste is super .... you will never forget the taste ..... ..............................................
3
I feel Bismillah is simply overrated and overpriced. It is not THE best biryani in Singapore. The kid goat biryani is simply overpriced at $15.00. In fact, you now cannot find any best biryani shops in Singapore. The old timers who used to cook the best biryani have gone out of business due to old age or rising cost. I'm also craving for good biryani restaurant, but nothing seems to satisfy me in recent year. And trust me... I'm not picky or fussy about food
5
One of the key dishes I always try no matter where I am in India or for that matter now in Singapore is the "biryani"This particular dish shows a lot of creativity when it comes to the style of cooking and the right ingredients. Today I can with a speck tell you whether the meat and rice is cooked together in a biryani or not :)I got to know about Bismillah Biryani from a blogpost. Since early Feb 2014, I come here at least twice a week. Their chicken biryani is absolute delight. The rice texture along with tenderly cooked chicken is delicious. Their shami kebabs are a must try too.I have tried the seekh mutton kebabs - it's quite juicy and different from what others in Singapore might be churning out.This place lives upto its taste and is a definitely must visit for biryani lovers. If there is something better than this - please do suggest and I will personally go there to justify their taste too.* please dont compare your nasi biryanis with a dum biryani as then you really dont know what a biryani is. Moreover if you are those that expect to eat your meal in a nicely done fine dine place - this is not for you.But if you happen to be a true blue biryani aficionado - its place you must visit while in Singapore
4
Demand far outstrips supply. Go early in the day, preferably before noon to catch some of the good stuff. Otherwise you will not get to try their heavenly lamb or goat biryanis. It is spicy, so if you can't take spice then too bad, you might not have a great time. The flavour and the tender meat are the best I have had in Singapore. The flavour of the meat makes it way into the rice in proper dum biryani style. And their kulfi is exquisite too. Even their kebabs are good, if you are lucky enough to try them
3
Since this food joint was a stones throw away from my hotel 81 dickson, I decided to try the biryani once. It is located in a corner of dunlop street, however the shabby nondescript look of dimly lit poorly furnished restaurant does not evoke gastronomic appetite Still, I ordered for one chicken biryani costing S$8 However,biryani should ideally be of beef or mutton as it is 'dum' cooked by the juice of the big chunk of mutton/beef Since I am not to take red meat, i went for a chicken biryani and it was not very delicious or mouth watering because I being from India is accustomed to tasting better biryani
5
Got this one from Anthony Bourdain's Layover and although it is a bit hard to find - it was well worth it. Its a small, "hole in the wall", but those are exactly the type of places that get you the best meals. Try it and enjoy it
4
It's not the cheapest eating place in the area, but the money spent is well worth it. Large portions of fragrant rice and tender meat. It was a little spicy for me but delicious nonetheless. Don't forget to have their kulfi too! One portion is never enough and it always leaves me craving for more.
2
There is noting special about the biryani meal. I had a 'kid goat mutton' biryani there last Sunday afternoon for lunch. Guess what did I pay for this? $15 for the mutton biryani & $8 for a chicken biryani. I think that I should be more careful & alert to check on the food price in future
5
i havent had better biryani than this, the owner is also a fine man, he opened the shop after in the night to let me have his biryani
5
This dum biriyani place is exceptional. They do not sauce it and it is cooked over coals (dum) in the traditional Hyderabadi way. The tender mutton is delicious with the perfectly seasoned rice. It is a massively filling dish that is so moreish, that even though you are full, you have to keep eating. As the sign says - they don't give any gravy, and it doesn't need it.The whole spices really come through and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. Superb and great value
5
We ordered the chicken biryani and vegetable biryani, both of which were well made and served in large portions. The sauce on the side was a perfect complement. This isn't a fancy place, but the atmosphere is quite enjoyable, with locals and tourists alike mixing in the open-air hustle and bustle of Little India
4
This place is all about the food and the locals seem to agree. I had the mutton biryani which was outstanding (in my novice opinion). The portions are large, the spices fragrant. It was great to slurp down with some homemade lime juice. Bismillah is just another unassuming open-air shop in Little India and is easy to miss if you're aren't looking for it. But make no mistake, the food makes this place well worth seeking out
3
We came here after reading about it in our lonely planet guide and then seeing the positive reviews on trip advisor. The restaurant was fairly shabby, but the service was good and the staff were very friendly, however the biryani (we had mutton) just didn't live up to expectations. It was 'OK' and that was it
5
The best mutton Biryani I've ever had! And I was thinking about it the next morning. :)Ok, this is not a fancy eating place at all. But the Biryani, you have to try.. $12 for mutton biryani, $8 for chicken biryani. They are full of flavour. You just can't stop eating. Oh...the service, It's an experience by itself. :)I will go there again and again...it's a place you want to take your picky foodie friends to enjoy a delicious meal
4
Tucked away in Dunlop Street, this little place is nothing to look at, but the welcome is generous, the food superb. We had kid goat and loved it... Some rave about the kebabs too - we just couldn't eat any more! The home made lime juice is nice too... Recommende
4
Had to visit here after reading rave reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. We both had the mutton biryani both tasty and filling. We finished off with a pista kulfi (Indian ice-cream).All for a bargain $25. Don't be put off by the décor, the friendly staff more than make up for it
3
I decided to go here after reading various reviews because I love a good biryani. However, it's firstly not easy to find. It is in Dunlop Street which is in the Muslim Quarter and not, as I'd thought, in Little India. It's No 50 Dunlop St (almost opposite Perak Street) and you'd never know it was there, as there is just a scruffy piece of unpainted, plain plasterboard where a shop-front sign would be, hidden under an awning.There is a much smaller sign only just visible, mainly hidden by the awning. It was about 3 pm and we'd already had lunch (an excellent beef rendang reviewed elsewhere). Although open, it was obviously not selling food. I asked if they were open, and was told that they closed from 3 pm to 5.30 pm, (something I didn't read in any other reviews) so if you want a late lunch, go elsewhere as there are plenty of other places open nearby. It's also slap opposite a mosque with a lot of staring young men hanging around outside, and was very noisy when prayers were called.As to the food, well, what can I say? Average? Yes. Disappointing? Yes, but see below. Scruffy? Yes. Expensive? Very much yes compared to similar places nearby. Service? Three reminders needed.The food, to be fair, was plentiful. Very large portions and my fiancees chicken biryani was a lot better then my mutton one. The mutton had obviously been slow cooked for a long time, so the large amounts of gristle and sinew were soft enough to eat, but I'd say made up for 50% of the 'meat'. The chicken was $10, but the mutton was not priced and turned out to be $12. On Mondays and some other days, (Saturdays is another) they have kid goat for the adventurous.All in all, I wouldn't return as there are many other places just as good and 20% cheaper
2
I really don't understand any good comment about this place and why this would be top choice in LP. Compared to other much better places it is expensive and the food disappointing having all the overwhelming reviews in mind. No need to go there at all.
