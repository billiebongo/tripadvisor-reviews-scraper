Whether you're looking for a place to start or wind down your night, this funky bar offers a great atmosphere to sip on a few a cocktails. The cocktails are beautifully and individually crafted to spark your senses. The bar staff are friendly and are happy to offer you great recommendations. with every sip you take it's as if you're exploring a new flavour from another world. The atmosphere is romantic and colourfully lit up by candles like viewing a starry night sky. Perfect for a date or a party. It's advisable to make a reservation as this place can be crowded on the weekends. So chilled out and epic music for an incredible experience. Would highly recommend this bar if you're looking for a unique cocktail haven

We had a team night out here and as they did 1:1 cocktails went through the menu and tried most of them! I think they diluted the alcohol....as no one was hammered! Food was interesting too.Service was quick rather than personable.Nice busy atmosphere, everyone leaves after the happy which was nice!Recommended

Really, my favorite bar in Singapore. Right by my office, been going for more than a year now. 1. Innovative cocktails2. Can talk to others and hear your companion3. Nice staff and bartenders4. Cool wall art5. You can order UberEATS there6. They have their own fantastic food menuThe cocktails are also served in interesting ways. Get the Whiplash if you want a dessert-ty drink.

Be adventurous and go for their interesting mixed cocktails. They can customize and blend cocktails according to your preference as well. No bar bites available but they allow you to order in (UberEats etc). I tried Mr Bean (interesting combo of soyabean, kaya with alcohol), Sakura Spring (lemon juice, yogurt, strawberry jam and sake) and Whiplash (strong taste of Irish cream/Baileys). My favorite was the Sakura Spring. Drinks are also served in a non conventional way such as bowls or teapots depending on the order. Pricey but worth it! Each drink averages at about $25

I can highly recommendedThis place. Location is cozy and the bartenders are amazing. You just say if you want a sweet or sour cocktail and what alcohol base and then they make you a bespoke cocktail. Every cocktail is unique and optically beautiful. A must try for cocktail lovers

We almost walked by this really nice place for a couple of drinks. The entrance is not hidden, but plain enough to not notice it the first time one passes by. They have a good collection of Gins and do know how to infuse them with different tonics and other ingredients. For example I tried the "Bathtub Old Tom" Gin and they burnt a piece of cinnamon to infuse it with its smoke. It was legendary.The staff is very polite, friendly and have a great bar-knowledge. Great place and I'll definitely be back soon.

Nick, the owner understand attention to detail, from the pairing of the Sake to the Somea and his understanding of what we were looking for!I think this restaurant/bar must be a little like finding a perfect spot in Heaven - awesome food , unbelievable cocktails and great wine/sake!Thanks Nick

Popped into this place rather by accident as we were out hunting for a dinner place around Tras Street. It's relatively new on the dining scene as it was formerly a bar. The open kitchen which is new takes up the front part of the shop house. Drinks choices are somewhat limited as I think we were the first to be dining there. Food wasn't that bad. Could be a promising place in time to come.

Decidedly great musing and mooting has gone into a distinct beverage&cocktail bill of fare!
Flawless presentation and significantly palatable!

Now they have bar bites, love the spam fries! Cocktails are good but a little pricey (about SGD23+++). Try the seasonal cocktails.

No cocktail menu. Just tell the bartender what you like and he whips up something delicious. Mine was something like an old fashioned with a splash of cognac and something a bit citrusy beyond the orange twist. Yummy but no name (how to repeat next time?! Tear!) Lovely environment dark and cozy. Will definitely come back again

Visited twice here during the week and it had fairly manageable crowd. The ambience is more casual and open, with not too much noise making it easy to have a chat with people.Also not as dim as other places.They had a long menu of drinks so take your pick

Tras street is beginning to come into it's own. Most people will talk about Club St, or Duxton Hill but take the time and discover this little Singaporean gem,The bar is one of the new breed of "tell us what you like and we'll make a cocktail around it". But Jeckyl & Hyde do it better. The mixologist is an artisan and artist. Doing high pours, arcing pours and anything inbetween it's great theatre.And when the drinks delivered, they take the time to tell you about what it is they have created for you. Then there's the bar snacks......some of these are sublimley delicious. The scallop cakes are mouth watering, smile inducing delectable delights as was the spicy crab. Beaut people, good music & a great environment. A really good find

Recommendedd to go here by friends and happy to pass on the recommendation.Modern interior. Somewhat darker than normal. Excellent service.Cocktails delicious. Mr Vean different and worth a try. The margaritas good also. The sundowner ( I think, bottom of menu with Bacardi) very light and refreshing.Slightly higher than normal, but not unexpected at a bar like this

$35 SGD for 2 happy hour cocktails, including mandatory 10% tip. The Jekyll drinks are standard fare and nothing special. The Old fashion was not even a thimble full of whisky on ice. The earl grey gin martini on the Hyde menu was good, but again, nothing that unique. Call me spoiled living in London and Amsterdam, where awesome little speakeasys abound (Happiness Forgets, Calloy Callah, the Mayor of Scaredy cat town -- london; tales & spirits -- Amsterdam), but this bar is a poser which just doesn't hit the mark and leaves you wanting more (and half your money back). Also, how is $16 for a regular price $18 drink happy hour?? The "signature drinks" are $23-26, but again, a browse through the ingredients left me unimpressed. On the bright side, service was friendly. Atmosphere, meh -- dark back bar with high tables and chairs, nothing special

I just loved this place! Small enough to be cozy but not too small to be constricting, serves amazing cocktails and (most important for me) mocktails. And the snacks were delicious!There is also a shop in shop, Manicurious, a nail salon that is open al day

I was there with the intention of having a pre-dinner cocktail but loved it so much my friends and I decided to stay on. Even missing our dinner reservations!We had the Park Bench (Oolong tea-infused gin with lemon syrup and passionfruit), Mr Bean - ("Local tau huay meets an upgrade with vodka, butterscotch liqueur, frangelico, and fragrant kaya"), Mangosteen Martini ("Mangosteens, elderflower liqueur and gin conspire to laze around in sinful pleasure") and The Strawberry Manhattan ("French strawberry liqueur lends a scarlet touch to rye whisky in a Manhattan twist"). And they were all good. No, great.The presentation was top-notch. The balance of the liqueur with the various ingredients was sublime. Especially the ones using local ingredients. The descriptors of each drink was obviously done tongue-in-cheek. The bar itself is whimsical, fun, cheeky and full of character. And the free flow of snacks made us stay on and on and...We will definitely be back. So kudos to the team - both at the bar and the waiters. Oh, be careful with the Strawberry Manhattan though. Despite the name, it hides a real potent mean streak! You have been warned

Nice character in the bar, not too small and chi-chi, but also does not get too rowdy or boisterous. Jekyll and Hyde can be kind of hidden when you are walking from Tanjong Pagar MRT, but keep a lookout for the name of the bar on the pillar outside!Seasonal cocktail menu with quality drinks, a great selection of artisanal gins that make me want to do a gin & tonic with all of them just to try them all, and great classics as well. The bartenders are friendly and a wealth of information if you are able to go when it is not rush hour. Place becomes hectic especially on weekend nights, and it is highly recommended to call ahead and make your reservations.Jekyll and Hyde does not serve food, so make sure to get your dinner before popping over for drinks
