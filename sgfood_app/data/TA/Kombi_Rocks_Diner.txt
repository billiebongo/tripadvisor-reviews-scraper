Have dinner in this restaurant. Nostalgic decor reminiscent of the 60s. Most surprising is that they serve mainly Thai food .... sawadee khrap üòÅ
The food is tasty and service staffs friendly.

A restaurant for young and old. For the young it's retro, for the old, it's nostalgic.
Unfortunately it was a Saturday night and staff were overwhelmed. Food was only good for the stomach.

We ordered a tom yum goong soup that came with a bowl of fish cake soup with dried shitake mushrooms and 3 small prawns. Although the price of $14 was reasonable, the ingredients definitely was not worth every cent. The service was also stale. After we gave a feedback on the soup, the response in return was ‚ÄúThere are 3 prawns not 2 (because initially we saw only 2). This is a standard serving.‚Äù We ordered the Thai mango vermicelli salad for another shot at the food. It was just alright. Not worth a visit if you live far or looking for good thai food.

Went there last night (17/12/17). The ambience was certainly rocking with many rock memorabilia such as electric guitars, Beatles photos and posters. There were many Volkswagen memorabilia such as advertising, models and posters. The food was good. Asian fusion was the theme. The helping was big but the prices were very very reasonable. The service was excellent and prompt. They are able to accommodate special requests. A place to certainly try. You will certainly go back several times.

The restaurant is very unique, cosy and different in concept! We took a lot of photos on the decorations. The food they serve is Thai food and we love it because the taste is great. They also have different types of wine, cider and beer. The Yuzu wine is a must try. The staffs are very friendly too. Overall, I give 5 ‚òÜ for this restaurant.

Happen to meet the owner and I was so drawn to dine here after seeing the pictures online. So we did. The diner is packed with all vintage collections everywhere and they're all fascinating to check. The lists of menus as we checked through are a combination of thai and local singapore cuisines. We ordered the chicken with red wine and a homemade spring rolls and fineld the prices to be fair for singapore rate. The staffs are so attentive and very friendly and made us feel at home. What made this first visit even more amazing was when the owner allowed us to see his crazy vintage collections to his garage. Wow oh wow!

This is a nice Neighbour diner with good Thai beef noodle soup. Very authentic and moreish. The other food choices are mainly Thai food such as fried rice and pad Thai. There are some western dishes so that both parents and kids can enjoy a dinner together. The service is friendly and the ambience with vintage collections of 60 and 70s memorabilia is quaint. It is quite busy at the weekends so be sure to put all your orders in at once or food may get cold waiting for other dishes to arrive. Perhaps they can come up with a self serve option to improve work flo

We made a pit stop here for dinner when we were cycling around. The food is okay - depending on what you order it is a hit or miss. I had the mee goreng which was nice, my boyfriend had the Thai chicken with rice and egg and this was not great - just fried chicken with plain rice and a egg on top. No sauce or gravy. Well, the menu didn't lie, we just expected something tastier.The ambiance is nice and unique, staff was friendly, and main course vary from 7 sgd to 15sgd.

Finally found time to visit this iconic dining destination near the Kovan / Serangoon Stadium vicinity. The ambience if vintage Vespa, Beatles and hippy cool throw back to the 60's but the food is a mysterious mix of Chinese cum Thai cuisine and a limited alcohol drinks selection. The none alcoholic drinks are superb!Seating capacity is limited to about 10 tables of 4 indoor so must book in advance for larger groups. The menu is fairly extensive and every dish we order was pretty competently cooked and served really fast. Service was polite and efficient.The Mee Goreng (order the larger portion to share) is well fried Punggol style but the Prawn HorFun lacks that "Wok Hei" taste that is so common across the island and can only be rarely found in a few truly traditional eateries. The best dish is the fantastic Thai steamed Otah which although small serving for its price was loaded with fresh chunks of fish and mildly spicy. The Thai red wing mid wings were nice but tasted mysteriously like Marmite chicken (pullinga fast one?)! The crispy fish skin came piping hot and crunchy but the dip was lack lustre (skip this dish). We did not try the desserts one display but they looked really sick and lonely in the chiller and priced to kill. Definitely can't be their forte.The real prize of the visit is to explore the neighbouring shops that belongs to them, like Koon Kee (its old name), the solitary barber shop and the gorgeous display of vintage VW vans both indoor and outdoor.Definitely worth a visit down memory lanes

This has become a somewhat regular place for us as we live nearby but also and more importantly, we do enjoy having lunch in this unpretentious, cozy little diner. Staff is warm and friendly, thai food is good in particular the fish cakes or the pork with basil. Do not forget to try the Thai Iced Tea (just perfect if you like it strong like i do) together with the heartwarming food, and consider the sharing platter if you go for the first time.

The ambience was great! Went there for dinner on Friday. The tom yum was sour and only sour. below average. Probably only good for their finger food.
3
The main draw of this cafe in the rustic north are the several retro "Kombi" vehicles, which I have heard are available for rent. Food is decent, though you'll be better off spending that money elsewhere.
4
A quiet spot away from the bustle of orchard road. Excellent place to have a meal and catch up with friends.
Friendly staff, nostalgic atmosphere.

Went for a few drinks in the afternoon and the place has a real funky retro vibes to it without getting all pretentious. Big food menu but pricey. We had a jug of beer and it was delish. Fun time to be had checking out the decor and enjoying the atmosphere. For some reason the place is also popular with families so there could be a bit of noise. And people busy taking photos. Cool place to enjoy a drink in the afternoon.

Upon entering the floor, immediately thrown into another era with Beatles on one side of the wall and little knick knacks on the other side. What caught my eye most was the psychedelic clocks that I remembered hanging in our old house. Food wise, was pleasantly surprise they serve a nice Thai-Chinese style which was not expected. Love the Beef Hor Fun and Ngoh Hiang. And the VW buses parked outside are additional bonus to pay this place a visit

A small enthusiast garage for vintage VW¬¥s and Vespas, a 50¬¥s style barber shop and a small restaurant selling memorabilia with a kitchen and diner serving Asian fusion food in snack form.... quite special, but it works really good. OK, the service is sometimes a bit slow and sometimes they forget something... but the food is good, ambiance is great and they are lovely people! We had a blast and the owner proudly showed their vehicles and talked about the latest car meetings and so on. I really recommend this place when you are out having fun with your friends. Laid back and cool
5
Got warm apple pie and a wunderbar beer, nice atmosphere with lot's of character. They have as far as I saw for VW Bus, an old Porsche and more around the place to admire. The hulk see picture is giving you the oddest welcome. Can not judge the food, but if around give it a try

I would wanna thank the staff of Kombi rocks to keep me accompanied thruout my meal on Sunday when I was thr alone. They makes me feels like I am eating in a hostel cafe, very friendly and humble people!Thanks to The Ladies Card for introducing this wonderful cafe to me! It is not only a simple cafe, it is a family business that comes a long way since 1971! I love the vesper and the vintage van that is outside the cafe, stretches all the way to the maintenance and barber shop. This place really makes me feels relax and lay back ! Their seabass and fries is really a wonderful western food pair with screwdriver. This cafe have a very clear restroom too

Some 2 weeks back, ordered take-away from Kombi Rocks @ YCK. Great beef hor fun and Thai milk tea. Decided to check out the place - to put a face to a name. Was there last evening - cosy and nostalgic retro setting with The Beattles and VW paraphernalia; die-cast cars for sale and The Hulk and Spiderman for company. Had the large prawn with glass noodle/vermicelli in claypot and Thai milk tea, plus tried the Thai green milk tea. All were superb
3
I ordered Mee Goreng with crabmeat and Sliced Grouper, glazed bittergourd with black beans. The portion for both were huge for my husband and 6-year-old girl. I do agree with the other reviewers that the prices are a little steep. The service was all right, not fantastic. The vintage ambience was really nice. If I go again, I would probably go there for drinks and desserts
1
The decoration is really nice. Need to say it is superb actually. But the food is then really expensive and not good. I had their signature kinda fishball noodle it was S$15 and I am telling you I could the same. For S$3 ....

Serving local zi char and western food which is just average, it is still a good place for a trip down memory lane with the cool retro decor and an awesome collection of retro collectibles and vehicles to photograph.
2
Place was cozy. Menu is quite extensive with a selection of typical local and "Thai" fare. The food.Tom yum soup was too salty, wok-hei beef horfun was under-seasoned with no hint of wok-hei whatsoever. The minced pork with basil and beef kway teow were acceptable.Quality of food and the prices charged are an obvious mismatch. 10% service charge was levied, but you order and pay at the counter before food is served. Pretty ridiculous.Small bowls which were stained and had food bits on them were given to us for the soup. Not cool.Staff were friendly and obliging when asked to help take pictures, which was nice. If your only intention is to have a half-decent meal though, I'd suggest look elsewhere

The setting of the restaurant is nice and retro. Food wise we would give it an average rating. But we like their handmade prawn roll (Ngoh Hiang) @ $8 (7pcs), the outside (skin) is crispy n the inside soft, the sauce is also tasty with vinegar. The wok-hei seafood hor fan was average and to me is taste similar to normal zi char which u can get outside from normal coffee shop. U can skip this and try other dishes. The fishmaw & crab broth is slightly above average, is a can try dish. Will go back and try other dishes.
2
Just really average food quality .Portion, not enough for growing teens.The $14 red wine chicken wings are a rip-off, in terms of quantity n taste.Scrawny half wings w 2 pcs of keropk and 1 piece of small lettuce .They shd take that off the menu or really need it up to a reasonable $14 standard .Basically go to any coffee shop to get ur zhi char fix , this is not the place 
3
The place looks very authentic & vintage with the van, motorcycles. There are a few good dishes, like the otah, thai papaya salad, the wok hei char koay teow.The combo was a little too pricey for my opinion and not worth the value. All deep fried items. Long bean veg was very disappointing too
3
A stone's throw where we are staying. Initial reaction on seeing the place - one of wonder, excitement and awe. A place of unique charm filled with classic and vintage pieces on the walls and shelves. Photo opportunities on old motorcycles and vans in mint conditions.Food is a blend / fusion of Chinese and Thai. Prices are reasonable for a family of 9.... however portions are on the small side. A fair variety of food and drinks. Dessert was a let down saved for their durian ice cream, molten lava cake with ice cream and ice cream float.A sore part: You order at the counter, make payment(s) and service by staff sucks.Those wanting a nostalgia place to eat, drink and "hang out" with friends... for family dinners - not reall

I am simply amazed by the effort the owner Ah Hai has been put in to transform the old restaurant Koon Kee Restaurant into Kombi Rocks Diner! Koon Kee is started by his father and he took over. Kombi means Mini Bus in German. There are only 19 left in Singapore! He has 8 of them! Check out the Ride and Dine package!

And I thought I was the only one who felt they have a queuing system problem.... in fact, I don't see they have a place to queue.The front of the restaurant had the boss' beautiful Porsche blocking anyone else parking there and blocking your sight to locate the restaurant, so that's a very good tactical move.At one side of the restaurant is a row of Veedub mini vans (the real deal) parked there for display. So that's one good news for all local Veedub fans.I can see and feel that they are trying their very best to make things work. You will receive no lacking in friendliness, but at any point of time, the staff (young or old) looked quite lost and badly overworked....We ordered only a few dishes and noticed that they have no inkling of how the different dishes should be served.And example would be: Our noodles would be served first, while the rest of our side dishes were being served thereafter. It was a lucky thing we were slow eater.The couple at the next table wasn't that lucky. By the time they finished all their food and looked as if they were ready to leave, an elder wait staff suddenly came from behind and dropped a large dish of stir-fried vegetables on their table. The couple were stunned, looked at one another and I could see the guy's face turned very very black. :pFood quality is (to be honest) not too bad. Many zichar stalls in Singapore these days couldn't even cook like them to dish out food that still retain the heat and flavour from the wok. I thought that requires skill. My kudos to whoever that's mastering the cooking in the kitchen.Nevertheless, whatever goodness and attention the food has to receive were all taken by the toys and vintage collectibles on display or on sale in the restaurant. In every aspect of operating a business, I thought the place lost its focus. It's bloody noisy like a coffeeshop, it's slower than a coffeeshop, it's bloody claustrophobic than a normal modern coffeeshop, and it has a section of their restaurant closed for no reason during dinner time. One other thing, until today we are still trying to class the place - a restaurant? a bistro? cafe? toy shop? toy museum perhaps? Veedub collectors corner? It's absolutely mind-boggling.Ample parking space at the stadium's open space carpark across the road. And if you missed this paragraph, no fear, it will probably just take you another 10-20 minutes to make a turn inside the private housing estate behind the restaurant while glancing at your GPS to make a detour back to the same spot.Return to eat? Hmmm....maybe not. I have lotsa other coffeeshop options at closer proximity. Thank you :

First time come here..... But it shall be our last time too..... They do not have any system for queuing. A family came before us, but they do not know where to queue, so they just stand around outside whereas I went in to ask for seating. The uncle, quite friendly, but he's at loss too. He offered to reserve a table for our family, but the other family is unhappy when we got a table first. That family go off without eating.I ordered 3 dishes of food (Crabmeat Mee Goreng, fried rice & Sambal Beef fried rice) & 3 drinks (Root beer float, lemon drink & iced chocolate), but only iced chocolate came. Crabmeat mee goreng came shortly after but there's very minimal crabmeat on it and they charged $13 for it. No other drinks were served but yet they served another table who came later than us, their drinks. I went to ask about our drinks but was told coming. The lemon drink turns out to be a canned drink which I dun understand what took them so long to serve us.Food were served slow. My wife finished her pathetic crabmeat mee goreng and yet my food was still not here. In the end, demand to cancel our outstanding order and I walked off without taking my dinner. I only paid for fried rice, iced chocolate & root beer float cos I cancelled the lemon drink & sambal beef fried rice. I argued that the crab meat mee goreng is not worth the value, which they did not charge me. Initially I do not wish to pay for service charge but since they did not charge me the mee goreng, I paid the 10% service charge.

Nice deco with friendly staff. Food more like fusion mixed with Thai flavor. You need to make reservation or be early or else it's full house on weekends. A little pricey though.
2
only tried the ice latte and its sucks. other than that, their deco is nice and vintage. there are old volkawagon van parked outside which further enhances the cafe vintage feel
2
Came with family. Ordered Grouper Fish Hor Fun for 2 but came for 1 serving. Quite nice ambient so it's rating 2 for me. No one served us, we had to see the menu and go counter to order ourselves, but pay later. Weird? Food is expensive for normal street thai food standard. $8.50 for a Hor Fun? The staff here is not welcoming. Very attitude. It's my first time here and definitely will be the last time.

This was the second time we have dinner here. The first visit was on a tuesday so there was live singing by a musicain and less crowded, a relaxing atmosphere. The 2nd visit was on a friday so the crowd built up steadily but still find it a nice place to dine and chat with friends without the live performance. The food is more homecooked style but nothing extraordinary compares to many better known Zi Char place, though it is more pricey but less the heat and noise you may find in hawker centers or other coffeeshops. Depending on the dishes it can take quite a while to get served.Drinks are served in a jar but a lot of the items on the menu are not available.It seems to be a popular place for younger customers, perhaps drawn by the decor and ambience
1
Waited for 10mins waiter just served me menu & waited for another 1 hour for food served, we only order fried rice, prawn roll & pork ribs w lychee! Not worth it!! The food is serve with no provide spoon & chopsticks, slow service! Some more the test of food so so only. Conclusion I will give tis restaurant 0 star

A quiet and interesting place tuck in the neighbourhood.It was a Saturday afternoon, there were only 2 other small groups (seems like the residents in the area) in the restaurant. We started our lunch with Kombi Nation Platter which came with handmade Thai fishcake, handmade prawn roll, pork ribs with lychee, Thai style vermicelli salad, crabmeat omelette. We also tried the signature red wine fried chicken and hor fan. We ended our lunch with the handmade yam paste with gingko nuts.Other than the platter, the other dishes are ordinary.It is a good place to meet friends to have some simple food
3
They have since rebranded as Kombi Rocks Diner, from the previous Koon Kee. It's still quite a nice place to hang out, and there are usually vintage vehicles such as Porshes and VWs around the area. They still serve mainstays like beef horfun, but it's now S$6 instead of the previous S$4. The price increase would be okay if service was quicker though. But we love the low chairs outside, though you might have to breathe car fumes from the nearby roads and the petrol pump just across the street
3
Cosy retro setting of the place, with pictures of beetle and Beatles around, vintage bike and toys displayed. In my opinion, it's a zi char restaurant but the food was average. I feel a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. Wait was quite long and it wasn't crowded. How long does one need to prepare hor fun? Hope it will get better, considering the effort spend in decoration of its place.

Read a few Kombi Rocks reviews from other internet sites. The actual dinning experience doesn't match the good reviews that they have been receiving. Sets me wondering how genuine is those food site reviews. Ambience: Vintage Kombi decorated restaurant. No air-conditioned. Menu Variety: Like modern chinese zi char with limited choices. Price is pricey for the quality.Food: Ordered platter and Hor Fan. Both dishes are a disappointment. Portion is small and food is not fresh. Waited more than 30 mins for the first dish to arrive. Drinks: Went with a group of friends. Coffee & milk tea is bland.Service: Only plus point is staff is considered friendly, even though super slow in delivery of food and drinks.Not recommend for food. A good place for small group of friends to catch up if you have no expectations

They have to sort out the kitchen. Food takes a long time to cook because they only have one stove. If you go there with an empty stomach, and it happens to be a weekend, you will likely feel very miserable with the endless waiting. The service staff cannot give you a definite answer when your food can be served. For takeaway and preorder by phone, if they tell you the food will be ready in 20 minutes, they really mean one hour. And do check what what you ordered is all correct when the hand you the packed food because they make such mistakes often to miss out items. I get upset with such inefficiencies and vow not to patronize again each time but I am still doing it. Maybe I am hanging on and hoping they will add more stoves and improve on their service. Prices are not cheap
