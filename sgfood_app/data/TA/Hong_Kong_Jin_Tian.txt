The roast duck and pork are consistent and are always tasty. They also serve soup and very cantonese style of food.

This used to be at Tiong Bahru until it moved to Zion Road in late 2014 (between Bistro du Vin, and Indo Chili, and just a stone's throw from the Zion Road Food Centre where the famous Char Kway Teow is). The Char Siew and Sio Bah are great. There is also a selection of other meats. The noodles option is my favourite because of its "kiu kiu" (al dente?) texture. Other than BBQ meats, it also has a seafood (zichar) menu. My kind of place for local BBQ meat fix.

Okay okay. A lot has been said about how this place has been over hyped, and I have to agree. The promise of some reviewers claiming this place to be one of the top places for roast meats in Singapore, leaves many of us, including yours truly, salivating before we even set eyes on the roasted goodness hanging in their still windows. But this is probably what leads to some reviewers leaving disappointed. It's not that the meats are consistently good, it's just that they aren't as great as some reviewers have made them out to be, and there's honestly no shame in being consistently good.The meat in the windows will prove too tempting for most. Make sure you try the honey pork ribs if they have them. You'll see I ordered a second portion in my photos and made short work of them. And try some of the other dishes on the extensive menu. Their also pretty good

I went all the way from the east side to the west when discovered this so called authentic Hong Kong roast meats restaurant online. I ordered a plate of roast duck with rice and a side order of the Duck Leg Wrap.Honestly I wasn't impressed by the roast duck, maybe because I have discovered another way better and much authentic place before visiting Jin Tian. I considered myself lucky that I had strong teeth, the Duck Leg Wrap was super tough to bite. Not sure if that was how it should be like? What I knew was, I won't be trying it again

Hmm...if you need a quick fix of your Hong Kong craving, you gotta try this out. Best juicy roast duck in Singapore so far, and as good as the one you tried in Hong Kong N.T. (hhmmm...am a hongkie, i am picky...) I love the crispy duck skin vs the tender & juicy duck meat. yummy.For the char siew (sweet roast pork), my order was a skinny version, so good for girls watching your waistline but might not for guys. Ask Uncle Yip for 50-50 (half fat half thin), you would love it.Siew Yok (crispy roast pork/5-layer crispy pork) smell & taste good. though i personally prefer really crispy version (say, baby pig) A normal roast duck rice comes with a soup for $5. Located opposite Great World City and next to the hawker centre. Surely you gonna see me there pretty often then.... hahah...
