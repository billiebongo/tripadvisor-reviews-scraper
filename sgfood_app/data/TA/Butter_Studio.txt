Great ambience and the best coffee stop in the culinary nirvana of Little India. Air conditioned with Internet access and cakes galore!

Came here for a coffee earlier in the week. Decent but not exceptional. A little too much froth on my cappuccino but otherwise good, and at the right temperature. Almost empty on a weekday lunchtime.

Great range of delicious desserts! Also offers some savoury options. Friendly staff, delicious food, nice environment to relax in and it's not freezing cold with aircon unlike some cafes. Items are reasonably priced. My favourite dessert place in Singapore!

Cafe is cosy and has good ambience. Their cupcakes and cakes are good too. Service staff was friendly and helpful. Slow a little bit but it was tolerable.
Not much people at the bakery so you can have your own privacy.

Such a quaint place, so convenient nice isn’t LG located in Jalan Besar just down from Swee Choon and close to Mustapha’s. The cupcakes are lovingly designed and the food rather good for a coffee and cake joint. They even allow the premises to be booked for meetings and gatherings!

Went there for afternoon tea but really wanted some food as we did not have lunch. Unfortunately kitchen was closed and resulted ordering their set special. Wow! Not to be disappointed with the cake, ondeh ondeh tasted as it should be, with gula melaka. Was a bit disappointed that the cake tasted like ordinary sponge cake with the gula melaka icing in between. Similarly our other order of sea salt caramel tart was good at first bite but then the sea salt was concentrated on one side awhile the rest was tasteless. The lychee tea made up the disappointment.We pass by this place almost everyday as we stay nearby but we were attracted initially to this shop with their Chinese New Year cookies. So hope the coming New Year will see more interesting items

We came across the cafe just after checking in at the nearby hotel. I'm a red-velvet cupcake fan so when I saw it on the menu, I said we must come back to celebrate a friend's birthday (my sneaky excuse honestly). This cafe did not disappoint. The cupcake is a yummy balance of fluff, moist and taste. We ordered "Salted caramel red velvet" cake for the birthday girl because it was recommended. Salted caramel anything is not my thing but it is rich with flavour. Belgian choc tart is recommended for chocolate lovers. I am also not a macaron fan but I ordered pistachio flavour and I loved it. I do love desserts but am easily turned off if they are too sweet and tasteless. So this cafe gets extra points from me because their treats are flavourful. Love their Lychee Mint tea drink which was very refreshing after our 2 hour walk around town. Their selections of lemonades are also good. So another extra point for wide selection of yummy drinks. We were rushing to the airport so we made a quick dash in and could not hang out longer to try other treats on the menu. Thank you to the friendly staff who was helpful to us. Will definitely come back when we visit Singapore again. Take note this cafe received an official halal certification too

Hot day and came in here to chill out. Place was a little quiet. Ordered an Ondeh ondeh cake and a cold Nutella shake.The cake was ok except that I felt the texture was a little on the coarse side. But I like it for the not so sweet of the cake.The Nutella shake was good but to eat both down at the same time, wow that was filling.I saw more people coming in for takeaways rather than eating in. I guess it's because it's not an easy place to find parking lot.It's a nice place to chill out if the music was not so loud.Hope they could have some savory snacks to lure people in.Keep it up

This cake cafe is located at Jalan besar, in the heart of the city. The cafe is nicely furnished and serves homemade cakes. My favorite is their butter cake. I heard their salted caramel tarts and chocolate based cakes are good too. Cappuccino is not bad.

Finally stepped into Butter Studio earlier today as i was eager to try out the cakes. I have been reading couple of food blogs and the cafe is consistently featured. Finding a parking space may be a pain based on the location but that's fine by me. Instead of trying the cakes, i was enticed by the selection of benedict eggs on the menu instead and finally ordered 'Good Ol Benedict'. The food looks good and taste awesome. I was already looking through the menu on what to order for my next visit. We ordered the famous Salted Caramel Red Velvet and the Sea Salt Nutella Tart complimented with Ice Butterscotch Latte. I am a huge coffee drinker and i must say that the coffee was fantastic, similar to what you can get at Starbucks. Also, I was overwhelmed by the sweetness of the cakes but they tasted so good yet sinful! I intending to try the cupcakes the next time though.Generally a nice cafe to visit and to hang out

My wife and I come here at Sunday night. The atmosphere was so cozy and comfortable for us, drinking homemade iced summer apple tea and listening to selected music.

location - Jln besar aka can be a pain to park but along main road so public transport is finepremise - its a small and no frills place. unlike other cafes, this place just focus on giving you good cakes and lil fluffs of cupcakesstaff - a lone ranger by the counter who must have been over worked and showed little or no emotions but served well nonetheless. crowd - at 215pm there were a family of 8, 3 couples and us 3. and this is on a Wednesday in the disgusting heat of Singapore sun!!! Resto can only sit 12 more pax in the inside. Outside seats available but i guess that's only for suicidal people only.food - the french toast chicken ham and cheese looks normal... but bite the Caramel Red Velvet..... I DARE YOU. per bite, it is easily 10,000 KCAL of absolute sin and orgasm in your throat. Soft to the touch and painless to slice off a slither..... gorgeously sinful thick fresh cream laced heavily on the top of the cake just makes this oral pleasure just even much better!verdict - oral sin yourself with the caramel red velvet..... release your belt buckle why dont you.... cos you sure hell aint gonna leave the place without trying that lustful bundle of cake

Went there on a Saturday late morning (near to lunchtime) to try out this place since TripAdvisor had recommended it as I was in the area. It was completely deserted with no one else, so we quickly found a seat and made ourselves comfortable.I had an Americano ($4.00) while my partner had a Hot Chocolate ($5.00).The americano was so-so with nothing special about it; the hot chocolate was constituted from some chocolate syrup mixed in water (could not taste any cocoa in it). I had to give these two a thumbs down.This was followed by a Chicken Ham and Egg Pie ($8.90), which for its price tasted really stale and mushy. Some of the food in the counter seemed to be leftovers from the previous business day, so again, I have to give this a thumbs down.We also tried a macaron ($2.20) - salted caramel was the flavour. Again, nothing special about it.Feeling completely disappointed in this place, I did see other reviewers mentioning that their Salted Caramel Red Velvet cake was a must-try. So I decided that I had to try this before I go (and before giving my final verdict).Boy, did I not regret this decision. The cake was real solid despite the fact that there was a generous dose of whipped cream that went along with it. The texture of the cake was just right (not too crumbly, and not too moist).Alas, their signature red velvet cake was the only thing that saved this review from going belly-up.The atmosphere of the cafe was pretty alright however, with a yellow theme that bring about a quaint little "cosy" vibe. Note that this place has no GST nor Service charges

I love this place and I'd love to love it more, but it opens way too late. How is one supposed to get a coffee on the way to work with such late opening hours? If they opened at 8am, I'd be at the Butter Studio every day. But alas..... I've only been there once and probaby won't go back because I don't drink coffee or eat sweets in the afternoon. Please open early! Please! :

It was quite quiet for a sun early afternoon, I feel. But like it this way actually. At least it doesn't feel as 'rowdy' as the other cafes. I ordered eggs ben & my friend ordered the french toast. Both are yummy! Didn't manage to try their cupcakes this time, as we are already kind of full and they have tarts and cake selections too - all looks good so we can't decide. Haha.. Ended up with the salted caramel red velvet cake. Love it! Will definitely visit Butter studio again and also recommend to my family and friends :

The classic pancake is a must and don't forget to top up the sea salt caramel ice cream. The set up of the cafe is normal but who cares? I'm there for the food not the set up. I have yet to try the rest of the food cause I came after a heavy dinner but even then I can't forgo the pancake. So guys what are you waiting for? go over and have one now

Our 1st time here & we just shared the Lemonade, Lychee Mint, Nutella Choco Banana Pancake & Farmyard Egg Benedict. Our verdict; we love the Nutella Choco Banana Pancake..RECOMMENDED, the $6 Lychee Mint drink tasted So-So & Not Worth It, the Lemonade..OK & the Farmyard Egg Benedict..Good! Service could be better; waited quite long for the orders!! Overall, SATISFIED!!

This is the 3rd time we tried to visit this cafe ( 1st not yet open but we're already hungry, 2nd try is their stocktake) and we were satisfied with the experience. A very cozy and spacious cafe with nice designs. The selection of cupcakes on display is mouthwatering. Nice staff but with a very soft voice. The food is great, the lychee mint tea is very nice. The red velvet cupcake is heavenly, it's now my favorite.Its a very nice cafe to relax and enjoy food. Will sure be coming back to try the other cupcake flavors

Cosy, nice decor but....Maybe it's because we went there 1.5 hours before closing time, but service was lacking.The girl was like.... sleepy? Ask her if they sold mineral water. Well, I don't want to eat all the sweet stuff and still drink sweet drinks, right? She just pointed to the water dispenser and walked off... Macarons were NOT nice. Hard and well, not that tasty.The chocolate tarts, on the hand, were perfection. Really really loved it. Will come back for the chocolate tarts.Really wished we got better service though

I could easily have spent hours and a hundred dollars here. There is an incredible selection of cakes and pastries that took me 5 minutes just to decide what to have, but I finally went with the sea salt caramel tart and hot comfort to drink (basically just warm milk with butterscotch flavouring but still pretty good). The staff are very nice and friendly but what struck me most was how they have created a calm and peaceful cafe which is a total opposite to the hectic craziness just outside. It is quite expensive but welcome to Singapore
