We had a dinner here to try its specialty on the Japanese style grill .The service and the ambience was so attentive and great. The quality of the food was good too. But I think for the price wise, that was a pretty pricey food.

Cozy place with fresh meats for grills and interesting starters. Very warm service from the staff as well. Highly recommended!

No doubt on the quality of food, and staff were attentive. However, IMO, it took them rather long to prepare two plates of sliced beef and pork before we can start BBQ-ing. Other than this, all are good!

We have been here for lunch and took one of the offers. Overall really good food and friendly service. Should come again and try some other dishes

Our dinner at Renga-ya was the best so far during out stay in Singapore. The beef and the lamb were perfect and the red wine (Orzada) was an excellent choice. The dinner was not cheap but worth it. The service was also really good.

Well done, Renga-ya. Really well-executed Japanese barbecue with attentive service and occasional Cheffy moments. A new favourite.

I rarely write restaurant reviews as I understand the chef can have a bad day or the resident chef is having a day off. Here is one of few exceptions. I went to this place just after 1pm, the busy lunch time. The restaurant was in the Chijmes complex full of eateries mostly nearly full. This one was quiet with only a few occupied tables, perhaps that was the tell tale sign and I should have known better. I had the signature set lunch of wagyu beef on rice with salad, miso soup and juice. Salad was refreshing, miso soup rather salty, juice sickning sweet from concentrate. The real reason that prompted me to write this review was the meat was uneatable, chewy, full of tendons. I left half of it in the bowl and complained to the waitress. She simply said she will give my feed back to the chef and never came back. When I asked for the bill and complained again, a manager looking woman came, rather than offering any apology or a dessert to make up (not that I was looking for a freebie) she started challenging my complain and said this was how wagyu beef suppose to be like, with a lot of fat !I am really surprised by the 5 star reviews here on TA, the place felt like a tourist trap. As I said, it was partly my fault for walking into a nearly empty restaurant when others in the vicinity were nearly full ! So be warned

I literally love this restaurant, the location is perfect and ideal to spend time after dinner in the nearby bars and cafe. I've been eating here several times, is more like a korean/asian BBQ but the quality of the ingredients is at the top level expecially the beef witch is mouthwatering. Recommended

We wanted to eat quite late (around 11) and we tried Chijmes. This was the best option still open so we tried it. Great decision.The style is Japanese Korean i.e. Not a traditional Japanese but they do a charcoal grill in the middle of the table with Japanese beef and pork. They had a good sake list and we filled up on fat boy BBQ and sake. Really filling really good and really friendly staff. It's a top venue.

This restaurant is in a great location. An old convent filled with a variety of bars and restaurants in a really old picturesque setting. This is more of a Korean BBQ than Japanese steakhouse at least in my opinion but the food and service was excellent. Would definitely look to return and try out more dishes as we stuck mainly to beef.

If you like quality beef, then this is one of the place to visit. The Hokaido beef is very tasty and melting in your mouth. Don't forget to ask for the Himalayan rock salt. The service is friendly and accommodating.

First time try this restaurant during lunch time. They have set lunch which are reasonable price which come with nice Miso Soup and delicious salad. Grill Chicken that I order is nicely cook. I will come back for dinner again.

The pork platter was better than he beef platter - for the same price aburiya might be better for the Waygu

We came to this place for dinner and we were not disappointed. The service is very friendly, especially Bety. She was always making sure everything was okay and helping us with anything we needed which was very nice to see. The food itself I cannot recommend highly enough. We had a set for 2 people which included a few different cuts of meat, various salad and ice cream at the end. Being able to cook it yourself on the hotplate in front of you is an even better experience.If you are ever in chijmes, go to this place if you like Korean BBQ style foo

A great place to enjoy Japanese BBQ without smelling like the BBQ itself. The charcoal they use does not produce a lot of smoke so I was surprised to still smell my perfume on my dress after leaving the place. Not a trace of BBQ smell. The pork platter was awesome! Beef Wagyu was also great! Craft beers were worth the try. Strawberry snow and the assorted desserts were also a hit!!Service staff were very friendly and accommodating.

We showed up just about ten minutes before last lunch order on a Sunday. The restaurant was basically empty except for one table. Rengaya is a Japanese yakiniku place, which means BBQ meat. In this case, you get to grill the meat yourself. Once you are seated they will remove this cover on your table to expose an opening which they set up the grill. Once it's hot enough you grill the meat.We ordered two sets - one Karubi and one Prime Beef with Pork Belly. Personally, I think the quality of the meat could have been better but not really a huge issue. The onion soup that came with our sets was terrible. It was way too salty and I barely drink it. The accompaniment of black bean was a delight. I really like it. It was soft and lightly sweet. I was happy to find one of the dip was yuzu sauce but it turned out a little flat.Throughout our visit, every single staff we encountered (about 4) was really pleasant and tried to provide the service equivalent to such a restaurant. I've pretty much gotten used to the service level (or lack of) on this tiny island so I was really happy to encounter not one but all staff that was doing their job well. I do hope to stop by one day again but please do improve that soup

We visit Singapore annually so we are always looking new places to eat. Well we have found it - great service, yummy food and great atmosphere. We actually went twice and tried different foods both times. The food was fresh, right sized portions and service with a big smile and they were only to happy to assist (you can cook your own food at the table) with anything you needed. We will definitely be going back on our next visit to Singapore. Would recommend to anyone who loves Japanese food, with a bit of Western influence - quite quirky. We wish them every success in the future

It took nearly 10 minutes before we got the staff's attention order our food. However, the staff made good by giving us a bit more attention after we raised the matter They were helpful and attentive. Food was great and the charcoal grill gave nice flavours to the meat dishes. The table was small for 6. Good range of Japanese crafted beer. The beer could be a bit more chilled and better to served in chilled glasses

Was there to celebrate my birthday with my group of best girlfriends. As this is our first visit, we were really excited and wanted to try all if we could. At the end of discussion and recommendation by their in charge Ms Alison, we ordered from the grand menu 1 meat platter set and 1 seafood set. The okra was a surprised and tasted well with one of the sauce with chilli. The baby spinach with sauteed mushroom was refreshing. The platter of kimchi was acceptable as is not my favorite and I particularly like the one with white radish and red carrot.At the end of the meat platter we were rather full as we ordered extra lamp chop, beef tongue & mushroom. The wagyu chop in the platter was incredibly delicious which iis one of the best i every had in Singapore Japanese restaurant. The seafood set with king prawn, huge sashimi scallop, ika, fresh oysters, breaded oysters, fresh were all yummy. Yuzu shebert was refreshing and nice. Shio ice cream was yummy for those who loves milky ice cream with abit of salty taste. We had the cheese ice cream which was a big surprise and is my 1st time trying and all of us loves. We also love the whole ambience in the restaurant and thumbs up to Ms Alison with the excellent and attentive service from her and her group of crew.Promo going on and we received $40 voucher to be use for our next visit within next 2 months.Am planning to go back and try some other stuffs in the menu soon
