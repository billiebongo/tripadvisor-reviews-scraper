The go-to place for flavourful Briyani Dum which is the best in town, and very reasonably priced for a generous portion that comes with sides. If you want to avoid long queues and weekday lunch crowd, go early on Saturdays before they sell out.

i love my carbs but it needs to be a worthy portion of carbs if you are going to risk jumping the scale. i remember the days when we feel nostalgia, and we will go hang out at the Tanjong Pagar Train station because there will be food and the late night Teh Tarik.And it was there i found my plate of happiness worth jumping the scale for - Ali Nachia Briyani. To be honest, i never remember the name until the craving came and i have missed it for the life of me after the train station closed, and finally....i found it again at Tanjong Pagar Plaza coffee shop.My favourite has always been the mutton briyani. The meat is well marinated and cooked to tenderness. And because the rice is cooked together with the meat, it's very tasty. i like the briyani rice here because the grains are very fluffy and nice. (You know, it helps to lighten the guilt of eating so much carbs.

We arrived at 2 pm on a Thursday. The cafe was empty after the lunch hours. We were fortunate to be able to get briyani chicken. We're advised to come around 11 am if we wanted briyani mutton or other items. They kindly offered us additional bowls of gravy and rice. At S$7, it was more than enuf to feed the two adults. The item was definitely one of the best Nasi briyani in Singapore. Will be back for the Nasi Briyani Mutton

Been craving for this since morning, and got my fix! My colleagues and I went to eat the nasi briyani from Ali Nachia Briyani Dam. They were formerly at the old KTM train station at Tanjong Pagar and shifted to this location when the station was closed. Was served by Rafiq Ali, the ex footballer who has worn the Singapore colors and represented Singapore for international football matches. This is his dad's stall. I had the mutton briyani. Rice is mice and fluffy. Mutton was tender and flavorful. Wished there was more gravy for the mutton. On the side were 3 accompaniments of achar, vegetable curry and thinly grated cucumber with yoghurt. Good stuff! This costs $7

This food stall was previously located in theTanjong Pagar Railway Station for 11 years& moved only when the railway station closeddown.They have been in this new location for five years now.Dum briyani is slow cooked basmati rice with mutton or beef.This gives the briyani a very flavoursome taste.Usually I order their chicken briyani but decided their muttonbriyani this time around.I was not disappointed. The mutton was very moist with therempah or seasoning well permeated.The mutton was also tender, fall off the bone so.The meal comes with achar (pickles), raita (yorgurt with cucumber& onions) & a small bowl of dhal gravy.The staff are very accommodating if you want more briyani riceor dhal gravy. I like more dhal poured directly over my briyani rice.It was a very satisfying meal at SGD 7.They offer fish briyani on fridays.The stall opens from 10.30 am to 2 pm.It is prudent to come early to beat the office crowd whostart coming in from 12 noon.The queue can get long when there multiple orders fortakeaways.This stall is closed on sundays
