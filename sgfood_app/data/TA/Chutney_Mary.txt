Nice food... good quantity and reasonable price
Try outs - Harabhara kabab, dahi batata puri, peas pulao, tomato soup.

Pricy Fast food to eat though
But nice to have Pav Bhaji
I ordered 4 buns to accommodate my love for this
2
Decided to try this eatery out because of its simple decor. Food is average but the prices are very expensive. Three small-sized dishes (two meats and one vegetable) and soft drinks came up to $75!
5
It was the every fist time I try great food and delicious !friendly staff !! I like it every much Will bring all my friends for my next visit
Will come back soon .

Nice authentic Indian food With a good selection for both veg and meat eaters.
Bryani doesn't look big but we kept eating and it never seemed to finish.
5
We visited Chutney Mary east cost, food is just great. This is out best Indian food ever had Singapore, prize also reasonable.
5
Excellent taste !!! If u want to have authentic taste .. this is the right place
Im a regular visitor here and anytime u visit ... quality of food never came down

Visited this place on Saturday. An average restaurant with too many items on the menu. It gave me an impression the food is precooked and frozen. Unlike other Indian Fast Food Restaurants in Singapore, Chutney Mary gives you the feeling of a Bombay Restaurant. The food is average, prices are a bit higher side than a food court, but this is an air conditioned place with table service
3
I was around the area looking for Indian food and visited Chutney Mary.The food was okay but the service was really something that put me off. The body language of the staff was poor and service was slow despite the restaurant being empty. Some of the dishes were okay in terms of taste but the portions are very small for the amount being charged
2
The place is small. The decor and seating is not great. The Menu is very Expensive. The potions are really small. 4 Adults and two kids we paid around 140 which is seriously high. That too two adults did not order any drink and we did not order any starters. This was just a main course menu. Exorbitant prices
5
Good variety of veg and non-veg options. Fast and efficient service. Good location with accesible car parks.
2
The staff was scared and not knowledgable. The food was good but poor service of lady staff. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
Had a great time with my Friend! The food is amazing! I LOVE THE CHEESE NAAN! I had 2 of those! The Papri Pakora Chat is very nice!!
4
Good food in a quiet setting. The portions are sufficient for a family of 4 and tastes nice. Would def recommend the chaat items
4
Loved the dosa and the chats. Pav bhaji could have been better
Overall good place for families . Icing on the cake was that you KF beer also
5
Excellent food and very nice service. The location is also very convenient. I would highly recommend this place.
4
Love the food here ....reminds me of food back from home ....personal favorite bhindi masala and the kulfi ...
4
Nice and tasty chatt which we repeatedly come here for with reasonable pricing!!
Its accessible from the neighbourhood and parking around if you driving.

Ordered for Pulav Rice and got just a boiled steam rice (charge 9 dollars + Service Charge and gst etc.,) and they are saying yes both are same with the tone that irks every other customer and showing ridiculous attitude thats its my mistake and take it else where. Seriously what world are we in, you show such attitude towards the customer and expect to flourish in this business, no way. Restaurant industry is to serve one person's hunger besides you make money. If you can't show right attitude and have good customer service whatever food you serve is of no use. P.S: I do own a multi cuisine restaurant back in Indi
5
The nice and cosy place is located near Siqlap center. It offers good Indian Cuisine that gives you a nice reminder of good days in India with some quality eating places. The food is good and tasty, the place is clean and gives you a nice comfort to have some tasty food. The service is quick and courteous with some nice people around to ensure you are taken care off. You can enjoy good Veg Biryani, Paneer, Naan etc. The pricing is bit on the higher side, but it is worth it for the quality they provide
5
After a long weekend i had the same taste like india ...nice food ..chole bhatura is delicious..pao bhaji is also good you get north Indian food also .. all staff is very familiar..mostly know hindi language..thanks
5
We have been coming here since 2007.
Indian chat / pau bhaji / indian food - all very good.
Its open for the whole day and doesnt get closed after lunch.
4
Great food and ambience! Friendly staff as well! Will definitely be back with family and friends :))
3
Good food, tasty. Could have been warmer but I didn't mind as the taste was good. Try the non veg thali set value for money
4
Good food, average restaurant, very good service. I liked Paneer Tawa Jalfrazi (Veg), Chicken Biryani and Goan Prawn Curry.. even good snacks!!! Will go next time..
1
Ordered palak paneer but got palak tofu. Tasted terrible. Bhel puri horrible and expensive. Cheats!! Really disappointing. Even the naan was hard and could not tear.
5
Let me first start off with an error in the Chope set menu for Chutney Mary. We were attracted to the good set dinner so we made our reservations there. But for some reasons, the restaurant did not have that set menu anymore and was not even sure if it was correct. But I showed the staff the Chope website and he did a few checks with his manager and graciously agreed to accept our choice. Not only was the food was good, the service was great! I thought it was very gracious of the staff to honor the menu although they did not have it anymore. Well done, dinner was delicious and thank you for a wonderful dining experience.

Chutney Mary is a small casual bistro in Siglap - Indian fast food restaurant serving authentic street-style food from India and offering great value on Northern Indian cuisine. Bhuna Gosht is boneless mutton cooked in fennel flavoured gravy and spices, which is my favourite main dish. Their popular dish is Pulau that my colleague and me had for our dinner. The Kulfi Falooda Mango as our Desserts was good because the much stronger flavour of mango overwhelms the delicate milk flavour of this dessert
2
Is this really a food restaurant. So much hype about their variety of food with all the pictures outside and huge menu list displayed. But guess what it's false advertising. When you reach the counter to order they give you a different list, smaller and ask you to choose. Worst still they sell parathas but only frozen ones. I reckon the bought it from Mustapha! Really shame for an airport restaurant. Pls close shop and give that space to a better standard restaurant. This restaurant is loosing money and it's shows.
3
Snack food - if you know South Asian food you know what I mean as for some foreigners they don't get what chaat and papadums are for lol - is best here. Meat and fish dishes seem to be good too. I agree with the fine print under the resto's name: Indian Fast Food
4
Dropping off my family, we had a good south Indian meal. Ordered dosa & Uttapam that was made in front of me at the live kitchen concept at Chutney Mary. Really loved the crispy dosa. Will definitely visit again to try new dishes!
1
Chutney Mary - has marketed self as Indian fast food. The service is extremely slow. On an average a simple dish take 30 to 40 mins!!
The quality of the food is bad. Please avoid!!!
1
Worse food quality and very very very expensive. Service was quick because they bring dishes immediately as they were already cooked and kept ready
4
Chutney Mary's menu is average. The food's good. And the wait staff is awesome. I'd recommend their sarson ka saag and makki roti.
5
Visited Chutney Mary over the weekend, though we had to wait for the order but it worth the wait. Ordered Punngol Vada and butter Chicken and Naan, one of the best meal ever - great authentic taste from India. Don't change anything - Keep up the great service and amazing location. thank you Chutney Mary ! highly Recommended will visit again

The place to have samosa chaat is definitely this place on East coast road and if you order medium size then its more than enough for 2 people. The taste is yummy infact reminds you of Indian chaats :D but the only shortcoming was the slow service. Rest the place is good to go for evening snacks :
5
This restaurant serves a large variety of Indian snacks and Indian meals it opens from 10.30 am to 10.30 pm.The food is tasty and price around 10 sinpore dollars for most of the snacks vegetarian main dishes between 10 and 15 dollars for small helping which is good enough for two people. Indian breads are priced between 3 and 5 dollars.siglap centre where the restaurant is situated is very well connected by bus and cab but no mrt station is close b

Went to CM's newly opened Changi Airport T2 branch. Was quite disappointed with food quality, average service and very pricy items. Even though it's a "Fast Food", CM can do better in terms of overall quality/taste of the food, service and pricing . Noticed at even peak travel periods, there were not many customers.Don't think will go back there again
2
I love chaats and chutney. Decided to give Chutney Mary a try even though I have often bypassed it on the basis that the eatery is often empty. Well well, now I have first hand experience.Waiter said everything was freshly made. I ordered Pani puri and Dokla. I am a huge Dokla fan (steamed lentil cake served with fried mustard seeds and fresh coriander). Their Dokla was dry hence not freshly made. Their recipe was too acidic for my liking. Their Pani puri had the same problem. It was definitely not freshly made. Sigh. Indian snacks are so fun to eat, a potential explosion of flavor in one's mouth. Not today though.
4
The chaats here are of good quality, portions adequate and tasty - we tried their Aloo Tikki chole, Samosa Chaat, paneer tikka and sev puri nad all of them were fresh and very tasty. The place has a limited menu but enough. The deserts - a few - the Rabdi was very good but the Gulan Jamuns, very sweet.Overall, not a bad place to eat out
5
Good place for chat lovers. Loved their pav bhaji and samosa chat. Hot masala tea after a long day at work was truly a treat. Must recommended for all chat lovers .
3
The food here is good Indian food, authentic and tasty. I had Masala Dosa which was pretty good.
It is surprisingly expensive for a place which markets itself as 'Indian Fast Food'.
Other than that it is clean and the service is ok.
2
The food taste was horrible and highly overpriced. We ordered pav bhajji and it tasted anything but pav bhajji. Better to avoid it.
5
One of the best paneer tikkas..a must try..my all time favourite place in singapore.I love the food here and on my every visit its a must visit place and it satisfies my taste buds.
2
The Quality of food is very poor. The restaurant environment like food court but amount the charge is very high. The staff are not friendly. It is not worth visitng better to try other restuarant in east.
2
Terrible restaurant, horrible service. The waiters did not bothered to come and take the order for 20 mins. At last when the food arrived it was a failed attempt from the chef against how north indian food tastes. I grew up eating north indian day and night being from Delhi and this restaurant is an attempt to sell frozen kebabs and chef's experiements. This place is no closer to serving any north indian dishes

We bought a voucher for Chutney Mary's and were pretty excited about trying it. Getting there is a bit of a task, and for all that, the food was below average. They have a reasonably extensive menu for a self proclaimed fast food place. We had the Paapdi Chaat, Samosa Chaat, Butter Paneer, and Veg Biryani (which came with Raita & Papad) - all Small (they have two portion sizes for most dishes). The green chutney on the chaats were very synthetic looking - the green was too bright to be true. The chaats were the only average part of the meal. The Biryani looked like it had cubed frozen vegetables thrown in, and the rice was very mushy. The Butter Paneer, like the Chutney oozed food colouring - the gravy was too smooth and bland. The service was prompt and friendly but the food was quite terrible and the prices too high for the lack of quality - coupon or no coupon

Our friend from Sri Lanka was totally impressed with the food tonight. We came to Chutney Mary's because of a bad experience down the street at another establishment. We are glad we did. It was my fourth time here but my husband and friend's first. The lamb, dal, palek paneer, and garlic naan and puri were outstanding. Service was friendly and good humored.The place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food. Our friend had a coconut custard mango pistachio dessert that looked yummy and he gulped it down! We will definitely patronize CM often
1
Please do yourselves a favour and find a really decent Indian restaurant .... There are literally THOUSANDS in Singapore. This place is vastly overpriced, with small portions, poor service and they don't mind keeping you waiting while they run up the bar bill.A place to be avoided at all costs..
4
This time we decided to have an Indian lunch with some south Indian dishes thrown in. The taste was authentic, although curries were less spicy to cater to all tastes. The service was superb. Will definitely continue to patronize this place for reasonably good Indian food at decent prices
3
Nice place to grab some Behl Puri. The Chat is abut average but this is one of the few placed in the east of Singapore where you can get Chat.. The Doklas are not bad and the vada pav is pretty good.
5
I really like the chicken tendori as well the Lassi. it is awesome... also the vegetarian food. Dosa and also the birianyi is very tasty.
1
If you have any interest in eating Indian food on the east coast avoid this restaurant. Quality of the food is poor, serving sizes reflects skinflint the customer and the food itself is tasteless and poor quality. Have been going there for the past four years and am seeing the quality of the food deteriorate over time.Chaat is street food and the prices don't reflect it. If the serving sizes were reasonable or the quality was good one would not be disappointed. However when the quality is poor and the prices high then there is no excuse for bad food.My only recommendation is to suggest that this restaurant should not be patronized till they improve quality of the food.

Excellent Punjabi food (they also have other choices like South Indian). We had Chicken tikka masala, Chicken kathi kabab, Veg Sheek kabab, Dal Makhni, Mattar Paneer and Basmati rice with accompaniments. The Chicken dishes melted in the mouth. The Dal Makhni had the right amount of masala and was delicately spiced. The surprise was the Veg Sheek kabab made of spinach. On the whole, a good eating experience. Recommended for those who would like to enjoy good Punajbi food without too much spice

We had originally wanted to visit another place for food, but decided to try this out as it seemingly provided fast Indian food. After going through the menu, we found that they served regular Indian dishes too, though limited.We ordered Curd filled gol gappas which are small round puffed fried flour based snacks with potatoe filling topped with curd (yoghurt). The yoghurt was fresh, hence it tasted good. However the oven baked (tandoori) fish was much too spicy even for the Indian palate. I do not know how the Singaporeans can relish it. Similarly the Chicken kathi kabab was also much too spicy for us, though being from India, we can eat pretty spicy food.However, the dosa was good as was the sambar which accompanied it. The lassi was drinkable.The savoury Gulabjamans (fried khoya in sugar syrup) were just ok. Khoya is obtained as a result of heating milk over a slow fire. The resulting solid mass is khoya.On the whole, pretty ordinary fare if you compare it with the authentic Indian snacks which you get back in India, but OK from the point of view that there is some nostalgia attached to having fast Indian food in Singapore for those missing it
4
we went as a group of six people to this on sunday evening.The ambience is very nice.They have very good chats and menu.in fact the menu looked very huge set of items.This restaurant is highly recommended .The servicing time is slow but not bothersome when you have sumptitious items being serve

Located close to the Beach park the restaurant offers Indian cuisine.We reached there nearing the closing time and the person taking our order pissed us off forcing us to hurry... We managed to place the order and convince he was having a rough day and it was ok now that we had placed the order. The food was not great but very ordinary. Taste was ok not special to mention. 5 Veggies so all we had was a Chola pattura,idly, masala dosa, Butter naans, mixed veg masala and a started i cannot recollect the name off :-). The worst was to follow . The power went off (accidentally - or i still hope so) and after few minutes it resumed. We tht that was the end of it, but was not to be. They couldn't wait for us to leave to try mend the issue and let us suffer in darkness. They when we realized it was a cheap trick they were playing to get us off the floor.The food cost us 4 less than a hundred dollars. There are loads of other places that offer better food for much less.It was such an unpleasant experience in all. My recommendation is- Avoid this restaurant if you can!!

Bought a groupon offer and visited Chutney Mary at Siglap last evening. It wasn't very crowded, which was good, since we were feeling very hungry and needed food quickly! We ordered a butter chicken curry, and a keema mattar and for appetizer, pakora. The pakora came within 15mins, and it was quite a disappointment. It was very unlike other pakoras I've seen or tasted. The pakora served here were simply several pcs of onion and potato and one chili, coated and deep fried in batter. Some pieces were burnt. Waited another 15 mins and the curries came. The butter chicken was at best average. Tasted like there was abit too much ketchup. Keema mattar was pretty good. Spicy and tasty. The garlic Naan was too thin and crispy for my liking. I like my breads fluffy and chewy! The prices are average but at this price point, I've many other options available! --end-

Chutney Mary is one of our favorite and frequented places for North Indian food in Singapore. The place itself has a bit of a fast food feel to it, though the prices are not fast food like! The food itself is excellent in taste, authenticly north Indian and they do make it with minimum grease upon request. Our favorites are the alu tikki with chana, dhaba yellow daal, chana masala, butter chicken and makki roti with sarson ka saag. If you crave Mumbai street food, the vada pav here is the best you can get in Singapore.
5
This is quite a nice restaurant in Singapore. The north Indian food here is pretty good, sometimes a bit oily though. I've never tried any south Indian food here though. The restaurant has a takeaway facility and that's a big plus -- I constantly order food from home. Love it
