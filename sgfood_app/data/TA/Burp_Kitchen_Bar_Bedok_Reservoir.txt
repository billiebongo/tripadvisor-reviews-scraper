The restaurant is hiding in the back of Block 739-743, facing the park and lake. Good drinks, nice craft beers. Good portions pretty small but tasty.

If you are looking for the most relaxing place, this is the one. If you are fine with sandwiches (very nice though) or some pasta, don't hesitate.

Friendly staff, nice atmosphere. A small bar aimed at sports, but I liked it. Had the pork burger, it was really good, freshly prepared, good portion. Kronenbourg 1664 on tap! Happy

It was one of those rare, rather dry and breezy evening with reasonable temperature of about 28 degC. Not muggy at all! It was not all busy so it was pleasently peaceful. Most of us had burgers and one person had pasta. The burgers definitly had interesting sauces etc. I was less impressed with the quesadilla and fried chk wings. And most of us wondered why chips (crisps) rather than fries. It would have been much better with real fried potato rather than crisps.Prices are reasonable

We are new to the area and live nearby, so we’re keen to try out the local eateries. I am a veggie and there is plenty on the menu for me and to keep my carnivorous husband happy! I found it weird that they do burgers but with crisps (that’s chips to you Americans!) and not chips (that’s fried to you Americans!). We asked for chips (fries) and were recommended the tofu fries. DO NOT recommend. I generally will eat anything and am not fussy but even I was struggling to swallow. Not a fan at all. The burgers and rest of the food was great. Would recommend they consider adding chips (fries) to the menu though. The dessert options I haven’t tried yet but they looked amazing! There is also a great selection of alcohol and it would be a cool place to meet up with friends for a couple.I have also been told the view is nice although when we were there there was scaffolding blocking the reservoir view, not to mention it was also dark. Once the scaffolding has gone n am sure the view will be awesome

I was rather disappointed that the view of reservoir was blocked due to some renovations going on. Otherwise, it think it will be nice having a meal overlooking the reservoir. How we did have a relaxing stroll after the meal. My friend was looking forward to having pulled pork that was in the menu but had to be disappointed as it was not available. The crabby burger and fish tacos were yummy

I was VERY surprised with all the good reviews as our experience was extremely disappointing. The kids ordered pork sausage with chips (instead of mash). This turned out to be very poor hotdogs (with a hard, inedible casing) and crisps. The nachos were OK but the cheese dip was not. My wife ordered the waffles, eggs, and bacon, but unfortunately the server forgot them on the counter. By the time she got them the eggs were cold and the waffles hard. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich - no cheese - and while the pork was good, it was too sweet and the bread was literally white sliced bread (a nice ciabatta bun would have done it wonders). I'd rate it terrible except for the nice location

When it comes to getting the best bang for your buck, this is the place.My family and I frequently come here for lunch or dinner and it is always a constantly good experience for us.I like the selection of food that they have and would recommend trying the taco’s (especially the pulled pork) where if you ask my wife the burps beef burger is her favourite. For dessert the Belgium waffles is a must!!Service is always good and the waiting staff are very friendly and attentive.  And to add that the plus side of things, unless you eat at a hawker you won’t easily find a place with better prices than here.Highly recommend this place!

Quiet and surprising! Place is at Bedok Reservoir and we are sitting out in the open close to the trees. Baja Fish Taco is good. Vegetarian options available here. Staff friendly and very honestly advised that portions are big! So we didn't over order. Beer is very good too. Will be back.

If its raining and it does on most of the days during December, this is definitely one of the place to be. The location oversees the beautiful Bedok reservoir. The aspects I loved about the place, quiet, cosy, efficient service, smiling staff and most importantly good food at a reasonable price. We had Shrimp quesadilla, garlic wrap with cheddar cheese, mushroom popper, veggie burger. The cocktails too were good. All in all, a good place to hangout

Excellent service and great place to chill, the Restaurent faces the reservoir as well for a scenic view.

We stop in here at least once a week for a few pints and the tacos and wings. The food is great and the atmosphere is relaxed. Great work guys :)

You gets almost all variety of liquors.
Lication is close to reservoir. Staff is polite.
Overall we were satisfied.

I usually stop by for a beer and bite while enjoying a walk around the reservoir. This place has a beautiful view of the the water and great deals on drinks!

The tasty burgers and friendly service keep us returning to this lovely little bar on the Bedok Reservoir.

Burp continues to serve good food in a tucked away corner of the island. The menu has expanded and prices have gone down and this is why I am reviewing again. Perfect. But I'll keep on ordering the beef burger, because it is the best in Singapore. Could it improve? Sure, bring back the blender for the cocktails, I say. The beer, apparently is very good.well, if that matters to you. The staff care about what they do and are attentive and friendly. There is a playground just down the hill, so the kids could always play when they get fidgety

Excellent food - very delicious Value for money - reasonably pricedGreat service - attentive and friendly. Husband and I visit this place on a weekly basis. Highly recommended to others! Be sure to make a booking on weekends

Awesome ambience, beautiful view of the reservoir, the way the horizon was shaded with trees makes the reservoir look like the ocean. Tried the beef burger, delicious

Honestly, if it weren't for Instagram I think I mightn't have come to this place. When we got there, there was only one other patron.Food, whilst affordable (about SGD 20 per pax), was really of quality (ordered the salted egg tofu fries, crabby patty burger, and grilled shrimp taco), and service was great. Dessert of chocolate chip cake, red velvet cake and accompanying movenpick (my fav!) ice cream was also delicious!A great experience in all: cosy place that's not crowded, with really good food. I hope business gets crazy soon so the place stays for a long time
