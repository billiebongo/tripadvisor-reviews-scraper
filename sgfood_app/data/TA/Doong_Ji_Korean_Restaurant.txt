I like the seafood steamboat where there are many seafoods such as clams, crab and prawns. Love the spicy soup too.

They serve authentic Korean dishes. We love her ginseng chicken. The only setback was parking. We need to search for parking and weekend is usually crowded

Doongji not only serves great authentic Korean food and drinks, they also display Korean MVs from various girl and boy bands during mealtime. Friendly staff too, willing to help you whenever you need.

We ordered oyster pancake, which is prepared quite nicely; and beef hotpot, which has a lot of tofu and all kinds of mushroom but not that much amount of beef. The quality of the beef is also mediocre. Probably should have ordered the more well known seafood hotpot

We have been staying around East Coast Road for many years and we like traditional, authentic Korean food. The reason why this restaurant is popular because like my partner and I, many of us do love and enjoy Korean cuisine and this is the ONLY Korean restaurant around East Coast Road within 400m in all directions that serves authentic Korean food.Undoubtedly, the food is great especially Ginseng Chicken, Steamed Eggs and Kimchi soup, Bean Paste Soup, Seafood Fried Rice are some of the authentic Korean food which we like. For those who loves pork, Grilled Pork Belly is the best the restaurant can offer.Kindly do not look for service in this restaurant. You will hardly get it.There was once I bought my family members of 10 from United States and recommended the restaurant. We went there around 6.00pm. The waitress told us that we only have 1.0 hour to eat as the tables were reserved. However, we sat for more than 1.5 hours, no one came to sit down.There was another time I bought my brother and his family there at 6.30pm. Half of the restaurant was not occupied. They asked if we made reservations. We replied: "No". Then the tall, plump-sized waitress told us all the tables were reserved and turned us down. When we were about to leave the restaurant, the owner, seemed to recognize me as we came the day before, came personally and asked us back. She simply just removed the tag "Reserved" from one of the table and asked us to sit down.There were several times when we bought several friends there and they like the small side dishes which they serve before main course and we asked for second helping of the some of the side dishes. There were 2 times they totally forgot about it and 4 times they told us they ran out of the side dishes. That's only 7.00pm then. They still have many hours to run the dinner for customers

Firstly, you must make a reservation if you want to dine in Doongji during weekend dinner. This place is packed and it's almost impossible to get a table during their peak hours.What we like about Doogji is the outstanding quality for food and good service.They are known for their authentic Korean food such as steamboat dishes (spicy seafood is popular), meat dishes and pancakes (popular ones are particularly kimchi and seafood pancakes). We had a Boiled Pig Trotters (non-spicy), a ox-tail soup and a kimchi pancake. For drinks, we had a bottled korean barley tea, most people seems to order that. After your order is taken, they will serve 6 side dishes such as kimchi, korean bean spout, seaweed, mash potatoes, etc. They are refillable.The boiled Pig Trotters is of a generous portion and it came with lettuces, sliced garlics, radish, green chill, kimchi, various sauces. This allows us to wrap the lettuces with the sliced pig trotters with the sides and sauces provided. The sauce and sides are also refillable. The ox tail soup was delicious as well. It was full of flavors and thick with generous portion of ox tail meat. The kimchi pancake was good as well. The food generally did not disappoint. Thumbs up!The owner is a korean lady and she is often seen helping out the staff in the service. The service in general was prompt and most of them are friendly and attended to our requests readily.Environment was good as well, lovely wallpaper and there's a tv playing k-pop music video which added to the atmosphere. Overall, a good dining experience at Doongji and will definitely go back for more whenever we crave for Korean food. Recommended

Made a reservation at 7.30pm and was asked to wait for about 10 min or so as other diners are still seated so there was no available table for us. After 10 min, the staff came to ask for the reservation details and realised that no reservation was made for us but we clearly had called a day earlier to make the reservation. After checking, it was a korean lady who picked up the call, and she thought the reservation was for the day before. However, we had clearly stated that we want the reservation for "tomorrow" but the reservation details were not even repeated to us and she just hung up with a "okay thank you bye bye", no wonder such mistake happened.However, we were very glad that they managed to get us a table almost immediately after clarification, and the food was really amazing. The food came in relatively big portions and I got to say that the cold noodle and beef bulgolgi were my favourite and definitely the must-trys for this restaurant! The beef was so juicy and tasted so pleasant and refreshing when eaten the korean way (with lettuce, garlic, sauce) and we couldn't stop eating. The stew came in huge portion and there were so many different ingredients inside that we had a hard time finishing everything! The kimchi pancake was pretty good too! Also, the side dishes that came with our food were so good that we asked for refills, but sadly they do not provide water for their customers unlike most Korean restaurants. The total bill came up to about $115 for 4 pax which was very reasonable considering the amount we have ordered. Would totally come back to this restaurant again, but got to double check if my reservation was made correctly

My second visit. Fully packed on a Saturday night. The restaurant is usually full during dinner time so it will be good to reserve a table in advance. My girl loves the potato pancake and friends chicken. Value for money but service can be better. Overall great experienc

We popped by this restaurant after hearing good reviews! However, there were no tables as the inside of the restaurant was fully reserved. Thankfully, we managed to grab a table outside. Recommendations: go for the spicy chicken (Yang-Nyeom Chicken) as the meat is not dry and they are generous with the sauce. We ordered the army stew as well and it was extremely worth it. Kimchi and the seafood pancakes were not too bad although I would prefer a crispy outer layer. Service was great but slow due to the number of people

Great addition to the Katong scene. Great food at great prices with what are best described as awkward staff. Very good, if you find yourself in the east wanting Korean you can't go wrong
5
Very reasonable pricing. Service isnt the best. English is bad. In fact they are PRC. Extremely popular with the locals living here. If you dont have a reservation come off peak or be dissapointed.

Overall the food was rather in big portion. Also able to top up small dishes. However, their service staff wasn't friendly,no smile and a lil tad of rudeness.
Table layout could be better.

Very good korean restaurant option in east coast area. Chose their stew, they are really nice, and portions are big (40sgd+ stews can easily be shared between 3ppl).

It's a typical Korean restaurant that got indoor but limited outdoor seats. Ordered kimchi stew w Maggy & sliced pork w veg aside that can either wrap it or eat alone. The stew got many ingredients! Just nice for 2 or 3ppl. It tastes great. The sliced pork is awesome by matching veg & some addon. Hot tea is served by individual teapack. It's another good Korean place that not missed

Just been to this restaurant for dinner.Good authentic Korean food although none of the staff speak Korean. Kimchi soup was excellent - not quite as spicy as Korea. - moderated to the local taste. Great kimchi pancakes too - delicious dinner - with two bottles of Tiger beer - large bottles just $40. Korean beer and soju available.Friendly staff - unpretentious setting - nice basic Korean food

This is probably the only place in Singapore that serves pork ribs & potato soup for 1 person. They served very generous portions and it was very satisfying. The side dishes were sufficient. No complimentary drinks or tea. However, the overall experience was great for me. $16 for a meal inclusive of all the extra charges

It has a homely atmosphere. They have a television playing some of them familiar KPOP music videos. It's located about 10mins walk from I12Katong. The food they cook, they serve and put in front of you is the one that makes you return over and over again. Budae Jiggae was a huge portion even for 3 people. The seafood pancake is delicious! You could feel heart and soul was put into it. There are set lunches in the afternoon, do drop by for some authentic Korean food. If you just came back from Korea and crave for Korean food. Go Doong Ji, no joke. There are other stir-fried meat dishes too. You just wouldn't regret :

Was here for dinner on Friday. This restaurant never fails, served authentic Korean food. Thier food is always good, ingredients used very fresh, value for money. Service is attentive. Must make reservations if u plan to come here for dinner. Ambience is really nice, cosy with sky blue background & pretty wallpapers like dining at own home. For food we had seafood pancake, portion very big, very aromatic with their garnish of leeks, prawns, cuttlefish & eggs. Next we have Kimchi soup, not so spicy, soup was awesome, full of flavour thick & very yummy. BBQ pork belly is good, not tough, goes well with the greens & dipping sauce. Cold noodles was good, tangy taste, served with some sliced pears. Something different. No harm trying. Like all Korean food, their side dishes always very interesting. Always look forward to their kimchi, can hve countless portion of this
