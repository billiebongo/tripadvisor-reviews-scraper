This place serves authentic, home-cooked food. Dishes are simple but fresh and without too much MSG. Like what youâ€™ll get if you cook at home.
Uncle and auntie are super nice. My go-to if I feel like home-cooked food.

~ the uncles & aunties who work here have been around since I was a kid, I remember this snack bar since Bukit Timah Plaza was setup 3 decades ago~ it's in a small corner in the basement 2 where shops around them have changed hands many times the food here has been consistently the same for ages~I'd always have just the "kai see meen" (pulled chicken breast with thin yellow noodle) that comes with green vegetable and green cut chili with sambal chili, there is always 2 times more ingredients than noodle... always100% a great place for local comfort food :
