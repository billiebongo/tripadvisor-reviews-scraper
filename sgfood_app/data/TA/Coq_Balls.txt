The service was great and made up for the rather expensive food. Ambience was so-so with some patrons being very loud. Nice place to chill out on the whole.

First time found a bar in Tiong Bahru area. The food was ok, the beer collections were nice. Trying something new. The service was ok, not too crowded during weekdays which is nice.

Food was food. Tried the fried pork for starters and had the burger n pizzas. The chill vibes is amazing, very conveniently locatee away from the crowded cbd in the more peaceful tiong bahru estate.

Nice place to chill after work on a weekday. Kind of a hidden gem. A short walk from tiong bahru plaza. However, servers should be a little more attentive.

We ordered steaks to be done medium rare and it was not. The food portion was unsatisfactory and presentation like food center. The taste was good to save the day.

Like the selection of food, tasty options which the crowd enjoy.
Parking a little tricky otherwise worth a visit

It is a very nice place to chill and drink with friends, the food is also good! Though i wished they had sour cream for their quesadillas but an overall positive experience! Will definitely be back again!

I like the environment.
Staff is friendly.
The food still okay and the price reasonable.
Just the ribeye steak that I ordered is not cooked as per I requested at medium well level.
Others like the pizza is delicious.

Most of the staff, though friendly, were focused on seating people, taking orders and pulling/serving beer. We were seated next to the food collection area and 2 appetisers were left alone for almost 10min before we went to ask if those were ours. A staff went to check and yes, they were indeed ours! A main course came and almost 5min later, we went to ask again and yes, it was ours once again! After that, we were quicker to ask whenever dishes came out that matched with the rest of the main courses we have ordered. However, 1 main course arrived 45min after order and everyone else has finished/almost finished. The atmosphere is great for having beer and serving of beer was fast so if you just want to have some drinks, go ahead, but not if you want to have some food

Time out stated this as hip and trendy. So as a 60 y/o male I was considering avoiding it. I visited mid-week so no crowd, little expensive for draught beer , but it's Singapore. I ordered sirloin as it was on the dish of the day menu, but even though it was only 7:30, no more were available the ribeye was very good, the veg was a very small portion and the fries were obviously frozen, so a point deducted. Staff were polite, and overall a pleasant if easily forgotten evening.

Good attentive service from fun loving crew. You get to choose songs too! They have good selection of beers and stout at decent prices to get the happy times started. Will be back soon enough.

Great ambience, but everything else was mediocre--slow and 'unaware' service, expensive drinks, and the benches along the back wall are raised with no place to rest your feet, which is uncomfortable after extended sitting (even for someone who's 185cm).
5
Love the ambience. Order carbonara and duck pizza. Both taste so good! Will definitely go back again!

Service was good. Great happy hour and the ambience was good. Perfect for after work and chill happy hour afternoons.

Staff not well-informed about promotion and food was average but expensive for the price. Nothing special and can do with additional training for their staff.

Enjoyed a casual meal on their modest 4 table) outdoor seating area. Lots of beers and ciders to pick from including several British beers in Bottles (Spitfire ale anyone!). Daily specials on draft and cocktails.The food menu is simple. It was ok. Nothing special.Staff friendly. Cost reasonable. Parking availability nearby

We were there at 7pm on a weekday. The place was not very crowded with five tables occupied including our party of five. Then a group of four guys came in and started playing cards at their table, shouting at each other at the top of their voices. This went on for the entire two hours that we were there and it was for precisely that reason that we left. Clearly they were a nuisance to the rest of the patrons. Happy hours are 1 free for 2 drinks and all they had available that night was the bar food menu. We won't be back

Managed to find this place after a short walk over from Tiong Bahru MRT. The entire restaurant had bar seating so it was a bit tough getting on a seat but we got used to it after a while. The food portion was rather large but there was a good happy hour nonetheless. Check out the huge mural of a cock for a picture since its the year of Cock

I was suggesting to a friend from overseas if she wants to try a laid back pub away from the city. First impression- it had a hip , industrialised look. The food menu was newly launched.With the usual burgers, pastas, finger food such as chicken wings, fries etc. We were hoping to see some salads or vegetables...
3
We ordered the following items and share among the 3 of us.1. Truffle fries - SGD 9.90 ++ - the portion is quite okie, not bad, the truffle taste is not so strong but at least the fries is not soggy. 2. Luncheon fries - SGD 8.90 ++ - fried luncheon meat with dip sauce. Not bad but portion wise a bit small.3. Chicken steak. - SGD 18.90 ++ quite nice. 4. Magherita pizza - SGD 12.90 ++ quite nice.
1
Just a very simple pub with the usual fair - Hoegarden, Stella, Tiger. The staff was either very new, ot not well trained. Not friendly.

Located just opposite my apartment , this is my drinking place to meet up with friends during weekend or just for a glass of beer after long day of work..

Visited this place only because we bought a groupon voucher (worth $40) to try out this restaurant, otherwise we wouldn't have gone at all. The place was very empty on a Sunday evening 6+pm and the staff knew from the onset that we had a voucher and told us about their happy hour beer promotion (full pint at half pint price) but they FAILED to inform us that this happy hour promotion cannot be used in conjunction with another promotion (groupon voucher). And our groupon voucher value doesn't include beer! We only knew about this when we asked for the bill and we were shocked as now we were left without a choice but to pay for the beer at full price and forfeit some value on our groupon voucher as beer is not included. Had we known, we wouldn't have ordered the beer at all! And no apology was given, she just said that she will inform the waiter to be more careful in future. Seriously? Bad service, even at a time when the place was not filled! Aside from the bad service, food was average, wouldn't recommend ordering the wagyu sliders as it is nothing special. Fish n chips at the same price would have been better. The skewers were tender but so-so as well, can do without. The nicest was probably the mojo wings. That's about it. Probably wouldn't patronize this place ever again. Once is more than enough.

A place for alcoholic drinks. We ordered the following items1. Pork on Skewers - $9.90 ++ - this is quite nice . 2. Grilled Salmon - $18.90++ - the salmon is a bit dry, sauce a bit salty. overall okie. 3. Margarita Pizza - $12.90++ - i like the thin crust pizza
3
A place to hang out and it can get busy on Fridays and Saturdays. The food menu is nothing great, and rather expensive. They try to compensate by having daily special for $10 on weekdays except Fridays. No problem is you are alone or with friends, this place caters for all including children

I was there especially for the 1 for 1 promotion, however when i reached they say it was unavailable. I went there especially for specific dishes that were mentioned on CHOPE application, however it wasn't available as well. It was a rather disappointing meal because i felt really cheated

Putting the bad food aside . I won't complain Coz it was on a 1 for 1 deal. What you pay is what you get. But I guess it was due to this reason hence we got no service for this .Upon paying the bills I realized that one of the drinks was not on the happy hour promo . We asked the waitress only to find out that she claim that we didn't order this during happy hour . We were positive that it was and she even confirmed there after. Well we assume That it had been confirmed since she didnt ask if we would like to proceed with the order of it was not on happy hour. Her Snobbish supervisor on duty walk over with to our table and the first thing he did was told us off 3x that it was stated clearly on the website that we will not be entitled to the happy hour due to the 1 for 1 deal . I am totally fine with paying for it since the difference is only $3 . We were angry over the attitude of the supervisor. The first thing you can do is to apologize or mention that she gave us a wrong information . Instead of telling us that we didn't order during happy hour . Least you can do is apologize instead of repeating like a robot 3x that it was stated on the website. And he still have the cheek to say that he is providing good customer service. other restaurants would have reminded us in advance that the drink is not entitled for happy hour promo and if we would still like to proceed. Instead she told us that we would just need to order one regular priced drink which we did .The subsequent drink will still be entitled to happy hour promotion . We even specifically ask again before placing the order for our 2nd drink. lousy food aside . Lousy customer experience

After 2 weeks of travelling in Thailand and then Singapore it was nice to find a quirky little 'Melbourne' bar in the street next to our apartment.We came in happy hour so the pints were at half pint cost and the cocktails were also reduced in price. It was quesadilla night so again, $10 quesadillas do not go astray. We also ordered a cheeseburger. It was just nice to have some decent Western food cooked well after 2 weeks of Asian food.Cocktail had a lot of alcohol in it, really packed a punch. I'm tired of getting cocktails that you can't taste the alcohol but wow, this one really ticked all the boxes. Lots of imported craft beers and ciders too, good selection. We ended up staying around 2 hours just chilling and eating and drinking and the staff there weren't pushy and didn't lurk around our table but were nearby if we needed them. Really laid back, really nice environment. It's a shame this isn't our local now we're back in Australia as we'd definitely continue to come back

Advertised as a craft beer bar but stocks a limited range which is very pricey even during happy hour. Located opposite a building site which also spoils the atmosphere. Located out of the way so would not recommend making the trip unless you are round the corner

A little hard to find. Walk out of the mall cross the street and walk to the right about 1 block past the apartment complex, then turn right. It's cozy and rustic. With a 20something crowd. Great selection of beers and ciders. Good music. Nice wait staff. Overall. A great hangout for a casual night out. Only drawback. A bit pricy. I didn't try the food.
