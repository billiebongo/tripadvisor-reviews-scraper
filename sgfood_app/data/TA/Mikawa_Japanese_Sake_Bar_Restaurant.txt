The chef and wait staff took excellent care of us with the chef's choice selections and very good shushi...

If you really need Japanese food in the Expo vicinity there aren't too many options. This one is pretty consistent with reasonable prices and service. The Chirashi sushi is my standard choice here.

Came back here for lunch today after a gap of quite a while. Opted for the Bara Chirashi lunch set. Quite good quality given the price. Efficient service also. Worth a visit if you're in the area.

Atmosphere was typically Japanese. I ordered a set dinner, the Gindara set dinner. It took a while to be served as it had to be grilled. Service of staff was average.

It used to be one of my favorite jap restaurant but it was pretty disappointed for my dinner today. Standard drop big time, nothing worth to mention anymore.

Came here for lunch today and opted for the Chirashi lunch set. This ended up being considerably better than I was expecting with very good miso soup and fresh fish. It's quite a quality enhancement on other Japanese restaurants in the vicinity. Worth another visit.

Great Japanese food but soooooo cold could not even thinks about going back.
No sqid which was disappointing but all good places said the same.

I returned here for lunch recently after a fairly long gap. Opted for the same choice as last time, the chirashi set lunch. This is pretty good value at below $20 and the fish was reasonable. Not easy to find acceptable Japanese food in the vicinity

Had passed by Mikawa several times but never had the thought of walking in until yeaterday. Was in the mood to search for new food place and chanced upon this so decided to give it a try. Wasn't having high hopes but it turned out surprisingly well.Good food + good service + peaceful (not crowded).Had selected the $120+ per pax omakase set. Able to tell that chef Joe has put in a lot of effort and every dish is satisfying. A couple of dishes have the surprise factor. For e.g. the grilled chicken skin has the same crackling sounds when having good quality siu yuk! Lol. Homemade yuzu ice cream consistency is very smooth and able to taste the yuzu bits which are bigger than the usual ones. Was recommended to try the shimbun sake, which is a gd recommendation. Not you want to drink it as and when can also able to drink. It is interestingly wrapped with 'newspaper'. Last but not least, a meaningful and worthwhile dinner is made perfect with a good chat with chef Joe, as well as his helpers. Not only a gd place to chill but also can make new friends. What more can I ask for? Certainly, I will be back... coz I still got sake stored there! :

We ordered the regular Japanese curry and teriyaki salmon and found the food above average. In fact for the price we paid it is good. As the restaurant is short handed on Sunday, we were surprised to see the Japanese chef serving us our dish. That explains the good food

The restaurant served very fresh and quality food with a very reasonable price. Although the restaurant is located at a distant from the West but the journey are worth travelled. Strongly recommend to people who loves good and quality Japanese cuisine, especially Sashimi.

The ramen during lunch hour sucks so much that I must write this review. The broth tasted extremely diluted that it's closed to tasteless. I tried the pork rib ramen - which quality tasted worst than a typical instant noodle. While my colleague ordered a miso ramen, the broth tasted like soya sauce + water. That's it. This is the standard they have for ramen. Totally disappointing for the value they charge. I swear this is the worst ramen i have ever had in my life and am shocked by the standard after the first sip. The portion for sushi set looks small and un-filling although I didn't get to try. But my colleague had to buy some buns after the meal in this restuarant. Ambience wise it's a comfortable and clean place for a meal though

I had found this restaurant a couple of months ago and I brought some friends down to have dinner here. The Changi Business Park area has developed in recent months and starting to be more vibrant with the new SUTD University opening in the vicinity of the business park. There are also more retail and dining options for people working and staying in the area.This restaurant is located just opposite the entrance to NTUC Extra Supermarket, so its quite easy to find. As it was dinner, we had both food and drinks. Here are the highlights of our meal:- Baigai Ni: $8 each. This was Japanese sea snails that has been boiled and left overnight for the sauce to flavour the snail. Its yummy. Reminded me of top shell, but not so tough in texture. Try it!- Kaki: $8 each. Fresh Canadian Oyster in a homemade Ponzu sauce and spicy sauce, topped with ebi roe. The spicy sauce looks like tabasco sauce. Although there was just a hint of spicy sauce, it reminded me of wasabi, which intrigue me, as I didn’t see any wasabi on the oyster. - Takenoko Ohiashi: $6. Boiled bamboo shoot with bonito flakes. A delicate dish that reminded me that Spring is here and it makes me feel like I am eating an Omakase meal.- Soramame: $5. Boiled fresh Japanese broad bean. The beans are big, similar to the dry crunchy broad bean that you find in the supermarket that you eat as snacks. This was fresh and you peel the outer covering to reveal the bean within. It tastes good. - Chef Special Sashimi: $45 each. We had 4 types of sashimi – Sayuri, Akagai, Otoro and Botan Ebi. The sashimi were fresh. What I like was the soya sauce they offered. It taste like superior soya sauce, like those served in high-end restaurants. Definitely different from other Japanese restaurants that I have been to. Eating the sashimi with the soya sauce enhanced the flavour. I recommend just a slight dip is good enough, to prevent the soya sauce from overpowering the sashimi flavour.- Super Negitoro Maki Roll: $18. To share. Unique presentation. You get negitoro in the middle of the sushi roll and its then topped with more negitoro along the length of the roll, and then garnished with wasabi sprouts. Negotoro was freshly made and you actually don’t need to eat with wasabi, as the wasabi sprouts gave flavour. Try it!- Salmon Mentai Maki Roll: $16. To share. I loved this, cos it has mentaiko. Salmon in the middle of the roll, then drizzled with mentaiko sauce, flamed broiled and topped with crushed up Pringle chips (original flavour)! I actually tried it first before confirming with the chef. At first, I thought it was odd, but the pringles chops actually went well with the mentaiko and salmon roll! Highly recommended!- Sukiyaki Mangalica: $8 each. This pork is from Hungary and they import it whole, and slice the pieces to order. You can order it as a steak or thinly-sliced shabu shabu or sukiyaki. We had our pork done sukiyaki style, which was a simple stir fry. The pork quality is supposedly of the same quality as Wagyu Beef. It was tasty and the onions and sauce came well together. Recommended! For drinks, I started with a Kirin Draught beer, and we had a bottle of Shinbun Sake to share. The sake is easy to drink and not dry. Interestingly, the bottle was wrapped in newspaper which you unwrap to reveal the bottle. The bottle doesn’t have a label on it. It costs $98.Overall, the food quality is good. Dinner time tends to be quiet, as the area is office-oriented and few residents.A hidden-find, with seasonal specials in addition to their regular menu.I will be back here again. Highly recommended

Japanese couisine one of the favourite dishes that i wanted to try. Few sushi pieces along with tempura and ramen added a unbelievable taste to my mouth. Japanese teaditional liquar named as sake which is made of rice was amazing. That was the first time i tried sake in my life. Mikawa staff also made a sense that im in Japan. The way they've dressed was amazing

I came to know of this restaurant recently, on a visit to Changi Business Park, which is behind to Singapore Expo. This restaurant is located right next to the entrance to NTUC Xtra Supermarket, so you wouldn’t miss this restaurant, if you are looking for it.The restaurant features a sushi counter where you can sit and watch the chef work. There are also private rooms along the side of the restaurant that can cater to private gatherings. All in, the restaurant can seat 80 pax.I had some time to kill and popped in for a quick meal. Here are the highlights:- Pitan Toufu: Two pieces of toufu topped with chopped century egg white, crabmeat mash, (pitan) century egg sauce, ebi roe and chopped spring onions. I loved this appetiser. The pitan sauce was smooth and creamy, giving the dish its ‘oomph’. The ebi roe gave some crunch to each mouthful.- Sashimi Moriawase: Tuna Ootoro, Amberjack & Mirugai Shell fish. The tuna ootoro was nice and fatty. I dipped it into the soy sauce and promptly put into my wife. I only needed to chew it lightly to enjoy the flavours. For the second piece, I let it sit on my tongue before chewing. I could feel the fats dissolving slowly. Good stuff. The amberjack was nice and the Mirugai shell fish was nice and crunchy. Sashimi were fresh and good.- Canadian Oyster: Served in its shell, the presentation was very appealing. The oyster was drenched in a home-made ponzu sauce and chopped spring onions. The oyster was fresh and the ponzu sauce went well with the oyster. After downing the oyster, I also finished the remaining ponzu sauce left on the oyster shell. To go with the food, I had a half pint of Kirin draft beer. Nice and refreshing.The food quality is good and the seafood were fresh. The restaurant doesn’t stint on quality. On the night I was there, the chef had regulars at the sushi counter and there were good banter and cheers over drinks. Regular customers means customers know their food will be well taken care of and it gives me confidence to come back again.Recommended

The restaurant was very full (always a positive sign) so a quick dinner was taken consisting of some great Fish dishes, prawns and true Japanese cuisine including Succhi and some good pork dishes. Prices were a little steep but nearly all the Restaurants in this area of Chijmes in Singapore were similar in price. Good location on the other side of the road from Raffles Hote

Dinner,Saturday night, family of three. All ordered ramen : prawn, miso and pork. The prawn ramen was given a thumbs up. The miso was good but salty. The pork ramen was peppery and a bit too salty. The egg in the broth was nicely soft, while the pork was delicately tender... but the broth was less of a hit, and the texture of the ramen was not as firm as I prefer. We thought Shin Sapporo ramen was better. Price was very reasonable, with 20% discount. I note most of the reviews were for sashimi n sushi, and certainly most other diners seemed to be taking those options. So perhaps worth a try for those, as ramen may not be their speciality.

Went to this restaurant after an event at Singapore Expo. Never expect much as it is hidden in the Business Park. After trying their sashimi which was recommended by their chef, was surprise to find it very fresh and good. Price was affordable and was given an 20% off as they are having dinner promotion. Have a great dinner, recommend to anyone that love sashimi.

Been here in July.. First impression.. Wow.. The atmosphere is very cosy and made me feel at home almost immediately.. The staff are very friendly too.. The food taste absolutely authentic.. Having spent 10 over years in Osaka, the food served is second to none.. Must try is their Salmon sashimi.. It simply melts in your mouth.. A must try experience for those who crave for real Japanese cuisine experience..

Great experience with Mikawa Japanese Sake Bar and Restaurant. Wide variety of fresh Japanese dishes, i love the sashimi here. I've heard the Fish are imported straight from Japan twice every week so you can be assured by their freshness. Would recommend this to friends. Awesome
