Best Mocha I had in town... Double shot is a norm here !!! So if you want it light, ask for Single shot.

Came back here this week for a coffee after lunch. It's a popular venue but it's still usually possible to get a seat. The cappuccinos are served just right and with a pretty design in the milk froth.
4
This coffee shop is one of the best in CBD. I prefer to have mocha or latte here. Being adjacent to my office, it is quite convenient for me to grab morning coffee.
5
Best in Sing!
Have tried many and this cafe looks quite unassuming yet boy it delivers.
Piccolo had great body, strong and smooth.

For all that love sour coffee, great place but this is not my taste. Tried it several times. Service is good.
5
This shop has the BEST coffee!!! There is a small inside so most of the seating is outdoors, in the shade. Best Coffee! You get to select your coffee beans. It is usually Honduras, Sumatra.
2
Since I'm not a big fan of sour tasting coffee I gave a bad rating. Been here several times, tried different kinds of beans. Usually same result.
4
Came here again today for a cappuccino after lunch. Today I opted for the Colombian beans, and the coffee turned out to be as good as it usually is here. Quite a challenge to get a table at around 1pm but we were able to get one in the end
5
Nice coffee shop with indoor and outdoor seating, they have a choice of coffee beans to keep the flavours changing. Jewel has a loyalty card so when you buy 9 coffee the 10th is free, this is not common amongst the coffee shops in the area, good service & good coffee
4
I visit the Collyer Quay branch once in a while - the coffee is on the stronger side so you have to like that as a prerequisite compared to something like Dimbullah (which is just across!). Only thing I dont like about this place is that the seating is just way too cramped - you can squeeze in if you really must but just about...
3
If you prefer your coffee with a lot of milk (like a large grande ) , you will love this! Not a big fan of so much milk tho

Server was too proud to explain the menu to us. Smirked and laughed at us for asking what their macchiato contained. Totally unpleasant experience.
5
Great coffee with unique selection of beans on a daily basis. Tends to be crowded during lunch time and barista and service staff tends to be less friendly and patient during peak hours.
4
Attached to the Orchard Hotel this coffee shop has the best pancakes in Singapore and the coffee is pretty damn good too!!! Reasonable priced menu and friendly staff.
3
Come here for a cup of coffee and piece of pastry. Not sure if it is my preference or what... Some pastry tasted better and others were just average....
4
I've been here quite a few times recently, both to the outlet at Shenton Way and to the other outlet in Collyer Quay closer to Raffles Place proper. The coffee is always very good and service is efficient. Definitely amongst Singapore's better venues for coffee and a significant improvement on what is available at the standard chain outlets
5
Arguably the best coffee in the Central Business District, run by people with a passion for the beans, who do their own roasting, and change the selection of beans most days.Great service, free wifi, tables inside, and outside tables covered in case of rain. A real buzz for 5 days a week, a place for locals to chill on Saturday, and sadly not open on Sundays
4
Tried the new Jewel Coffee outlet in The Arcade, just off Raffles Place. Opted for the Ethiopian beans. Coffee was tasty, service was friendly, and with some coffee art on top it was all pretty good. Only real downside is that it's not that cheap at around $6 for a standard coffee
4
Having followed Jewel since their 1st outlet at One Shenton, the great success this chain is undeniable. The coffee is still great and remains above peers. Having grown to an outlet of 4/5, the service quality has however deteriorated and in place are the part timers or youths who simply don't really care or whose heart are simply not on the job (very often you see them more fixated on their smartphones, tables are uncleared and preferring to joke amongst themselves). Its always sad to see how an establishment suffer from over-expansion
3
I came here today for a quick take-away sandwich before heading back to the office. Opted for the Reuben sandwich, consisting of some processed meat, cheese and sauerkraut on tasty sourdough bread. No complaints about the taste, but it was a little small (still quite hungry after eating it) and $10.80 was a bit expensive given the size. There's a good selection of coffee available here but you're looking ar circa $6 for a cup, also a bit expensive
5
Choice of beans and method of brew. Anything from simple Cafe Latte or Espresso or choose exotic Syphon filter. nice people and plenty of seats outside. Good for a spot of breakfast too
4
The have a nice selection of coffee beans. All coffees I've tried so far were very good.
Quite pricey for singapore.
4
the service was very good, and the place is in a good area with nice outdoor seating. Coffee wise was just ok. But would go back again if in the area
3
A good place to rest and relax but avoid the lunch hours if possible.
The bread served is fresh and coffee taste nice too.
4
I stopped in here to pick up a bag of their in-house roasted beans, and had a macchiato as well. The baristas were delightfully welcoming and helpful when I asked about a local post office (I'm not from Singapore).Can't yet speak to the beans, but the macchiato was well made and smooth! Great stop if you're downtown
5
Choose your bean, choose your style of drink and savour what must be amongst the best take away coffee in Singapore. But do note that if you want to sit down although there are a few chairs outside Shenton Way is a busy noisy thorough far
5
If you are around Lau Pa Sat or Singaporeâ€™s New Asia Square have a little walk and drop by at Jewel Coffee. Great brews and some snacks are on offer and usually two distinctly different types of coffee beans are available to make a coffee which meeting your personal taste. Keep up the good work
5
It's one of the more expensive coffee options in the area, but it is somewhat unique. They serve a variety of coffee beans, 2 at a time, which they rotate throughout the week. The choice is usually earthy vs fruity types. Beans are ground as they are ordered. Informative signs are placed right on the coffee grinder (grounder?). This helps if you're like me, who has no idea how coffee from Ethiopia tastes compared to Brazilian coffee.The biggest plus for me is that they offer alternative brewing methods: the V60 or Chemex methods, which I have not seen in any of the shops I've visited so far. I've tried the V60 thrice already and it has made me appreciate my coffee more.The seats are limited and there are no couches; it's not the type of cafe where you can bring your laptop and work. So if you're a picky drinker or if you want to take your coffee appreciation to the next level, I suggest you try this cafe out

Since I'm working at Asia Square, I always grab a latte from Jewel. It always has been a nice place where the service staffs are generally friendly (after this incident, I got to give this place a second thought). While entering Jewel, this young lady loud and rude voice caught my attention. She was reprimanding and ranting to the customer. The tone of her voice was just plain rude. Yes, customer is not always right BUT the customer was not being rude either. So what is the fuss about

Jewel is essentially just a coffee shop, albeit one that operates in a higher class than, say, Starbucks. They really do seem to be all about coffee with good quality machines, different bean and brewing choices (eg, siphon).Their espresso seems to be the best in the area, with other shops somehow ruining their espresso. Jewel gets it just right and seems to have a steady flow of clientelle as a result.Prices are a bit higher than I would like: my colleague and I had a cappuccino and a latte and paid around SDG 12. Granted this seems to be the norm for non-local coffee shops, but still, I cringe a little when I have to pay this much for a coffee.Anyway, I will continue to visit Jewel as it's the best I've found around my office

I don't know whether it is the best coffee in Singapore. Only i know is it become one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. I like cappuccino, Really enjoy
5
Fantastic coffees and superb service. My colleague accidentally spilled some of his coffee when adding sugar and the kind staff cleaned everything up and made a fresh cappuccino for us. Incredible.
5
Excellent fresh coffee blends daily, great eats and convenient service. The sandwiches are excellent value. The coffee is always very good flavor, never stale or lacking in flavor like some other major outlets.
5
What it says on the label. No more no less. A great place in the centre of Singapore Business District for really great tasting coffee. Other nice snacks available to make a visit worthwhile. No wonder it is so popular!
4
This is a great hole in the wall cafe fantastic for weekend brunch. The coffee is decent, the pancakes are fantastic and service is adequate. It's just a stone's throw away from one raffles quay. Worth checking out if you live in the CBd area.

NZ ers pride themselves on good coffee, but this place was amazing, probably the best coffee I've ever had, perfect texture, strength, heat, and smooth flavour, very impressed!
Go for the coffee , we didnt eat because it looked ordainary.
5
Perfect little shop in the heart of the CBD pulling great shots of espresso. Had a pour-over that was a bit of a miss but that happens. The guys working were great and stood up to a solid rush. They roast there own too.
5
Owner Adrian left a corporate desk job to pursue his passion. I was his first customer and I remain loyal because the flat white is the best. Always a choice of beans. First class.

The coffee here is by far one of the best I've had in Singapore. We were here on Saturday for brunch. Had a Mocha & Cappuccino, and the Brioche-Egg breakfast with Roast Tomatoes, Mushrooms, & Baked Beans. The coffee was hot, creamy, flavoursome, and totally awesome! The brunch was average - the brioche was just plain old thick toast not really like brioche at all, the scrambled eggs were a tad runny - while it wasn't disappointing, it didn't give us any wows. I'll go back for coffee, for sure
4
For a SEA coffee shop - brilliant! Expertly made flat whites.What would have been even better would have been a selection of single estate coffee beans, as at the moment, its a little too Starbucks in its lack of bean choice. Prices quite expensive. But that seems the way with coffee nowadays the world over
