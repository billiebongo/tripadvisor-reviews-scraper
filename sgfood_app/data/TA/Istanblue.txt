Cosy place to dine and hang out with friends. The best pide in the area. Their Kunefe is great too...Will always come back for more!

Awesome and friendly staff. Food was great! We had the mixed grill for 2 and it filled us up really well.
5
I come here with my Friend..the food was delicious and fresh,for location I just take MRT,from Bugis Mrt exit B and Walk around 8min..definitely will come back again ðŸ˜˜

Located in popular Arab Street area, the kunefe is characteristically sweet, delicious with Turkish tea which tasted light and perfect during afternoons or suppers.
We shared the mix grill, portion was truly a lot for us asians.

Iâ€™m afraid this was our worst meal while we were in Singapore. We ended up in here because it was probably the only one in the area where they hadnâ€™t pestered the life out of you to eat in their establishment. It looked ok, menu seemed ok but I suppose a lack of customers shouldâ€™ve told us all we needed to know. We both found the food underwhelming Iâ€™m afraid 
5
Anne really complemented my meal by offering me a free round of ice lemon tea and hummus amid the hot Singapore burning weather. Chef was Super friendly; probably the friendliest middle eastern I have met in my whole life, and I ate till I almost burst like a balloon!!!! If u want truly authentic Turkish cuisine, this is the real deal.

Situated in a well-known tourist area in Singapore with a great view of Arab Street and the mosque. Unfortunately the food wasnâ€™t great neither the humus nor the taboule were up to scratch. The kebab was at best OK. If you know and like Turkish food Iâ€™m afraid this isnâ€™t for you

Our very own Singapore version of Amy's Baking Company. Private messaged me in a very rude manner, insisting on their "excellent" food quality plus service. Utter disappointment. If the food is as out of the world as the owner keeps lamenting it to be, it will speak for itself with a busy restaurant filled with mostly happy customers. The disappointing food and cocky attitude simply explains why this place is empty and has 40%-50% promotions all the time

I went this restaurant many times and the quality is still very good. Go try other restaurants and come to this restaurant, you will see the difference in taste. Very delicious.Try their chicken or spinach pide or Ali Nazik and soup. Lentil beans soup is no doubt best in Singapore. Just try it you will not be disappointed. By the way they are well known for their Kunefe dessert. Only concern I have is during weekend service is slow but it is understandable since I think they cook everything fresh

Fined at last Sunday dinner of November 2017. All indoor tables were full, one table was available outside which I sat. Very friendly Moroccan staff. They have a Turkish chef and owner. Their kebab was very good (you wouldnâ€™t not expect from that place) lahmacun was ok enough to press your hunger and being home-sick, however served without proper condiments which server fixed quickly. I believe best Turkish place in Arab street, however do not order kunefe pls :) they have large room to improv

Quality and authentic turkish cuisine and great value for money! wonderfull desert kunefe I liked when I come to sg I will go again

Meat is so tough, i can hear it filling my teeth.
Made an appointment to skip my dental cleaning after that.

The heading says it all
Neither lamb nor chicken was seasoned other than some cheap tomato sauce. And pricey too.
5
Tasty, daily mezzes, lahmacun, pide and kebaps. If you feel like having dessert as well, try Kunefe or Baklava with Turkish tea or coffee. Not too fancy, not shabby; decent service.
5
Had a great visit; the chicken beyit was the best I've had outside of Turkey. It's definitely worth a trip.
5
I come here regularly with friends. They have a Turkish chef who cooks great authentic Turi5 food. Try lamb pide, Ä±zgara kÃ¶fte, kÃ¼nefe and ayran. Bon Appetite.

After entering the restaurant at 7 PM, we found no employee to help us find a table. Literally took 3 minutes to walk around and find someone upstairs to seat us. If youâ€™ve had Turkish food before, prepare for disappointment. Underwhelming bread, dolma that tasted like the canned variety, and subpar Adana kebab without the expected spices. Honestly, itâ€™s just not very good food. Also, after being seated once, we were asked to move and our table was taken to accommodate another larger group that had arrived after us. In the big scheme of things, not a huge deal, but absolutely not acceptable at professional establishments in the service industry. There are better options in the area.
5
Came here with my family and all agree the lambshank is great. Highly recommend if you are here.The dips are great too. Thick and flavorful. Every set meal comes with rice so if you are ordering to share, don't overdo like us. Tried the shish, but too dry for us. Restaurant is nicely done up. The staff are smiling and attentive. Great place, will come back again
5
The food and service was just right. Straightforward menu with good choices (rather than one of those overwhelming menus with a dish for every occasion you have never thought of) served promptly. Salads were crisp and fresh, wonderful mix of flavours through the food, none of which overpowered the others. I understand why others recommend this place
5
Tasty, reasonably priced real Turkish food in the Arab district. Beautiful light & airy decor with aircon inside. Run by a lovely Turkish/American couple who like to chat to their customers (if you feel chatty) we had a very memorable meal. My fussy teen daughter said she liked "everything" about it. I wish we could have fitted in dessert - it looked nice too! Highly recommended.
5
Really great Turkish restaurant in Singapore. Starters were great. Pide and kebab as well.
Absolute recommendation.
5
Having been to Turkey, there aren't many places in Singapore that serves authentic and tasteful Turkish food. I have been here on multiple return visits because the food and service are top notch. A good way to judge if a Mediterranean restaurant has hit its mark is by the way it grills its meat. The istanblue kebab, mixed grill and pide are among the best anywhere in town.
5
We went to the Turkish restaurant Istanblue in Singapore and we were welcomed there. They were so nice to us. The place is beautiful and the meals made us feel like we were in Turkey. I ate kebab and it was great. My children love the pide. It is a clean restaurant and the waitresses were sincere. I recommend this place. It is worth seeing
5
The food here was of very high quality, made the 30 minute wait for the food quite worth it. We had the grilled chicken with garlic yogurt and Turkish bread which was delicious - highly recommended. Also the kofte, which was also good. Restaurant seemed like it could have been in Turkey (apart from the Singaporean waitresses) the owner/manager came out after the meal to chat with us and other tables and brought us Turkish tea (in the traditional glasses) on the house. Very good value for money too. Also, they are on Eatigo! So we got a 40% discount on food
5
Best place to eat turkish foods. Kebab and pide are the same as in turkey. We felt like we were in turkey. Other meals were perfect too. I recommend this place to everyone. Even you are not turkish you can try these foods to taste the real turkish meals

I was able to visit Istanblue with a Turkish acquaintance who regularly frequents this restaurant. He knows the best items to order from the menu. He also sets the bar high on quality and service. The location is in the heart of Arab Street. Any walk to the restaurant allows you a chance to window shop the colorful fabric stores in this section of Singapore. We passed the gold robed mannequin holding a menu and headed over here for Ezme and Hummus appetizers. I was new to traditional Turkish food and really enjoyed the Ezme. For dinner, we had Lamb Shish with Bulgar Pilaf, Izgara Kofte and Chicken Beyti. Solid meal items and the sauce on the Beyti was perfect. My favorite, that I would not have picked without our friend suggesting, was the Kunefe with Turkish tea for dessert. If you like Baklava, then try this less sweet option with a heavy cream sauce and cheese. It was worth the extra calories. The staff seemed overwhelmed with a full house of tables. Service wasn't a step ahead of the costumer in terms of clearing the table from appetizers, empty drinks, refills or even offering water. The food was well worth a crowded table of dirty plates.
5
Was here to try the food among the many middle eastern restaurants in Arab street and i must say the food is nothing less than splendid. The beyti, adana kebab, lamb shish and lahmacun are must trys.Ive been to many middle eastern eateries and this stands out IMO as one of the must trys.Keep this standard up

Very simple set-up saved by a few Turkish lamps. The harsh fluorescent lighting on the ground floor certainly does it no favors in attracting customers. We were there on a Saturday night and waited 40 minutes for the food- even though it wasn't full house. When the food came, the waitresses apologized that they had run out of pilaf rice and bread- so they replaced these sides with fries :( Thankfully, they also offered a discount. The food was average, the setting a little cheap and the time it took to serve the food (and drinks) terrible. Waitresses tried to be friendly towards the end but it was too little too late.
4
The lamb kebab was very nice but they seem also disorganised - for example they had run out of hummus at 6pm on a Saturday evening...It's not a luxury environment but the food is good and the pricing is very reasonable. Note, there's no alcohol available on the menu
5
We made reservations and came here on a Sunday dinner. We came early and were delighted to be ushered up to the second level where we were given a nice large table for my big family of 10. The decorations were very nice. From our table by the window we have a nice view of Baghdad street.We ordered almost all the chef recommendations of the menu and then some. Most of the mains came with bread. The bread was straight out of the oven and Nice, especially when eaten with the hummus. We ordered a few rounds of hummus and bread. We ordered the Mix Grill which is a platter of the different Kebabs. This is good for first timers like us who really can't figure out what to order. The Kebabs were nice. The Falafel was really nice. The chick peas done nice and soft and tastes good once is served straight out of the pan. Service was friendly. They were prompt initially, however, as the crowd started to come, things were a little slow - but, we have no complain as that is expected when it gets crowded Overall, we enjoyed and we will be back again

If you are a middle east food lover this place is a must, a real and original food, just in singapore.
let yourself the opportunity to visit middle east without a long flight.
Enjoy you self

Our second visit in the last few weeks. Recommend the Ali Nazik and Beyti in particular. Great flavours and decent portion sizes. Reasonable prices and a seat outside to watch the world go by made a good Sunday evening
3
Visited with my Turkish friend. To be honest Kebab and its lamb was quite normal to me ... It might be because of my nationality, Japanese.
Dessert was too sweet to me
However Turkish coffee and tea was nice.
4
Good food, pricey though. For a change kids loved it after a hestic seven day in Malaysia. Start of the tour need to explore more.
4
We had dinner on 23rd dec night and were attended well. Food was served quick and everything tasted well. They were honest in admitting that baklawah is imported from turkey, frozen and served. Instead they suggested an alternate, which was quite yummy.
5
My highly recommended orders are their Meze Platter which comes with ballon bread and Lamb Pide.
I'll be back for other stuffs on the menu for sure!
5
Never having tried turkish food before, I was truly impressed. They had a good range of foods to choose from, and none of my group was left wanting. It was all delicious!I can't remember the name of the dish, but one of the meals was like a sausage roll, using spiced lamb and served with their own sauce, and it was incredible. Honestly, right up there with the best sausage roll I have ever eaten.The apple tea was lovely, also.I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area of Baghdad Street
5
I've been there with my family. On 27th of Dec. . We were lucky to find such resturant which remind us with the real taste of Istanbul cosine. We have been to several Turkish resturant in different places of the world but this is the best. Quality of food is magnificent. Very friendly staff . I wish if i can visit again

Stopped here after dinner for dessert. Had the kunefe and Baklava. Both came out fresh and hot with a very generous garnish of pistachios. The Kunefe was nice and crispy, with lots of cream. The desserts were very rich, so sharing them would be a good idea. Also got lemon-mint juice that was very refreshing. The highlight of this place was the service. We were greeted warmly at the entrance, served promptly and even given top ups for our drinks! Would want to try the main courses there next time.
5
I've been to many places and definitely love my Turkish food. This is definitely a gem of a place I found and it's certainly better than the Turkish restaurants within the vicinity. In terms of service, even though there's a manpower crunch in the industry, the owner, Mustafa, makes it a habit to be outside and engage his customers. Very sincere unlike the ones I've been to in Arab Street. Well done Mustafa and I hope you can keep up the great service and most importantly, the quality of your food.
5
The owner personally welcomed us into the restaurant. We requested for mains such as shawarma that weren't even on the menu and they were extremely accommodating and happily prepared them for us. Excellent service! I would recommend this place to everyone.
5
Be sure to order the kunef with your meal so that it comes fresh and tasty. Very good baba ganosh and excellent kebabs. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly. The upstairs area is very pretty with Turkish lamps and decor. Very nice overall.

Having visited most of the Middle-eastern restaurants in this area I must say that Istanblue is one of the better fare. Service, Ambiance is strictly OK but the food is good.....period!!
3
Near Arab street this is one of the few good places to eat. Tried the mezze platter and the really large pita bread. Best was the dessert baklava. Best one!
3
Good for.Baklaves
After my dinner I went to Istanblue Mezze & Grill House
They have nice stay at Baghdad and Basarah Sts corner
I had a portion of baklava and Turkish coffee
I like both of them
5
We walk in to this restaurant after our weekend visit to Haji Lane. We like to try new cuisine, and today was our lucky day! We order Turkish & Apple Tea, Adana Chicken, Chicken Pide and Falafel..the foods are absolutely delicious! We finished literally everything served to us. last but not least,we thanks to handsome chef for prepared nice lunch for us,at the same time, treat us another cup of Turkish tea! We will definitely came back for the Mix grill that you recommended
5
I have read the comments and opinion of you guys. But it was very opposite in my experienced, like the lady from London I absolutely love the food here. One of the best restaurant I ever visited in Singapore. From the staff, starter, main course and desserts, it was perfect. It was freshly and specially serve when I had dinner with friends at Istanblue meze and grill house at baghdad St. It was recommended by my good friend who's friend of the owner of this restaurant and at the same the time chef. I strongly recommend, if you happen and want to dine in this restaurant for you to have an excellent dinner and fantastic experienced like me, must contact master Chef Cengiz Aydogan if I'm not mistaken.

This is the worst place I have eaten at in Singapore. The waitress looked put out at my arrival and that was the best part. My Turkish tea had two long black hairs in it. I ordered chicken wings and rice which arrived around 25 minutes after I ordered it although there were only 4 people in the restaurant this afternoon. I had to ask for cutlery which prompted another skyward glance from the waitress. My bill was 24 Singapore Dollars and frankly the experience would have been a lot better had I cooked and served the food myself
5
I have tried a few other Turkish Restaurant in the same area however this one seems to be tuck away from the rest. No outdoor seating but EXCELLENT food. These guys do not spend their money on fancy furniture but focuses on their food.The salads are outstanding, fresh and crunchy. The kebabs are light and delicious. You can really taste the spices put in their food and the quality of their produce is bought fresh today. Most of the cooking is done over CHARCOAL not microwave or oven. Lastly Don't forget the unbelievable deserts prepared over charcoal to be eaten with yogurt or ice cream. Its value for money too. Lots less expensive than those fancy ones found in that area. Make the right choice, go where you can get good food!Btw, you can really see the kitchen, its neat and clean! Important! Enjoy

This place is among the hundred or more dining options on Arab Street. I had a very late night dinner recently when staying at a nearby serviced apartment. It was a bit scary at first in that absolutely no one was inside the restaturant - but that was because the customers preferred to sit outside late at night. That left me alone inside with what must be the entire family running the restaurant, and they are indeed a friendly, attentive bunch. The good - agh, good, not great. I had a lamb dish and bread. The bread did not seem fully cooked - you could notice some of the dough still not quite cooked yet. The lamb and its sides were ok, but seemed like most standard lamb dishes I've had in the past, not partiuclarly special. So, if you're going to Arab Street for an event, do some research to find a better restaurant. But if you stumble upon this one, enjoy - it's ok. BTW, the prevous review was pretty spot on, in my opinion - but they seemed to fare a tad better than myself
