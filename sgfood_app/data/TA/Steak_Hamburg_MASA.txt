Pretty good hamburger patties, juicy and cooked to my liking. Little bit on the expensive side so it may not appeal to everyone. My son said the mushroom soup looked very small but turned out to be quite filling.

We went here for dinner and the food was amazing, all 7 dishes we got were delicious. Highly recommend the crab cakes and prawns. It is expensive but the food is well worth it. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.

reasonable quality, but vastly overpriced. Many better Options in the area.
If you come alone, you are not very welcome.

They are famous for their Japanese style burger patties but try their pork chop. It is amazing. It took quite a long time for the food to arrive even though when we ordered the restaurant was not even half full.

Perfect charcoal-grilled steak! It wasn't cheap
but it is definitely worth it! It was like a date with the steak in the dark ambience.

Visited here with a group of 4 from the office. The manager gave us incredible personal attention. We had a nice green salad to start off and then several courses of the most delicious (tender, flavorful) meat that gets grilled right at your table.

Celebrated my Mum’s birthday here. It’s my second time here. Was here previously to celebrate a colleague’s birthday. Had such a good time here the last time that I had to find an excuse to come again!! Of all the starters, I must say the crab cakes really stood out. Delicate but yet carried it’s weight in gold!! The crab meat was really fresh and it was so so juicy on the inside. My mum had the pork chop as a main and loved it!! It’s seldom she gives a full thumbs up for her meat, so this was a rarity. She found the pork tender and succulent. Finished it to the bone!! I was fortunate that gave me a small piece to try. My dad, son and myself ordered the Hamburg steak. I ordered the 200g (although was tempted to the 300g) with the original sauce plus an egg on top. The home fries that accompanied it were to do die for!! The Hamburg steak itself was excellent. The quality of beef used was high and despite me ordering mine well done; it was not the least bit dry on the inside. Service was average though and the wait staff didn’t exactly seem to know the menu well. But overall, the good food more than made up for it.

Simple menu with traditional Japanese items. Ordered the MASA Hamburg Steak with Cheese and Demi-Glaze.... it was juicy and really tasty; great quality meat served on a hot plate. We also had a side of cream spinach, which was fabulous. Been here a couple of times and it's always been a good meal. It a a little on the punchy side and the steak is a little overpriced but positioned as Kobe / Wagyu!! Desserts are a bit of a mist; had the creme brulee and it was quite underwhelming compared to the main meal. Service is Ok, prompt. It's worth a visit and quite unique

The staff was very rude, slamming plates and cutlery on table. Ruder than a street vendor. Very inflexible on the menu for no explainable reason. Place to avoid if you want to enjoy your evening.I wish I could complement the food but I have a bad taste from the servic

Across from our hotel, Park Hotel, Clarke Quay. We arrived late and were looking for someplace to eat. Originally we tried to eat at what we later found out was their sister restaurant, Japanese BBQ around the corner. It was fully booked for the night. A rather small dark an intimate place with an opened kitchen in the middle. They grill over a small charcoal grill in the front of the kitchen. I started with burrata and tomatoes. It was one large piece of burrata in the middle over arugula also know as rocket. There were small cherry tomato sliced in half with a pesto sauce lightly poured on top. Very good but not as creamy as I am used to.For entrees, my wife ordered the waygu burger with red cheddar cheese. It was served with fries. GoodI had the 100 gram sirloin,Waygu beef that was sliced and melted in your mouth. Served a little arugula on the plate. Both dishes were accompanied by different home made steak sauces. Both were very good but I preferred the one fir the sirloin.Obviously a place frequented by the locals.Not inexpensive but definitely worth the price. They have a very nice wine list but I was tired so I just had a glass of Shiraz

I was there with friends and I had rhamboso steak and my wife had sirloin steak. Steaks are good and cook upto perfection n simplicity.
It's pricey but it was a blow out experience for me.

We came for dinner on Friday evening with 6 adults and we got the best service from the manager. She was attentive and recommended the best value with great quality. She also got out a specially made Sukiyaki wagyu dish which is not in the menu.The meat choices were great especially the tongue and sirloins. Also try the curry rice, cold noodles and the hamburger steak (which is half of what they are known for).Highly recommended and also in a quiet area of Robertson Walk where you can have a drink or two after the dinner

I bumped in Masa by mistake as I was heading to a closer restaurant. The dark ambient picked my curiosity and I checked in. Service are extremely polite and the restaurant is comfortable even if a bit old. I opted for an Hamburg, a sort of burger- no bun- with egg, cheese in. Presentation Was nice but taste was really average, nothing to remember. Panama cotta was excellent instead, one of the best had.

One of my favourite steak-houses that serves japanese beef and hamburg steaks. Warm and dim lighting, hence can be a romantic date-place. Music is jazzy some nites which is nice. Compared to many other steak-houses who have updated their looks into a "bright chinese restaurant look", I am so grateful for these classic, dark-wood, dim lighting steak restaurants that are classy and old-fashioned. I always return and will keep coming to support Masa

We came here for dinner on a friday night, we were a group of 4 adults with a toddler and an infant. The restaurant is quite comfortable and surprisingly child friendly.I ordered the Masa Hamburg steak, it is made with Japanese Beef of quality... Cooked medium... very tender and very juicy... Served with a house sauce which has a hint of sweetness and a rich taste of radish... A side dish of corn with butter is very recommended as well. Have this Masa Hamburg Steak with the famous Katsuyama Junmai Ginjo Ken sake... And you will have a very enjoyable dining experience

I was supposed to walk-in to Yakiniku Yazawa which is located next door to Masa (same group owner) but it was full - so I never had the chance to go to MASA hence I walked in with my 3 other friends.Atmosphere is modernly Japanese, not too chic but just the right mood for steak with dimmed light though not too dark for you to see the meal served in front of you.We were famished so ordered a lot of food but I almost had no complaint about the food, everything was well prepared, good texture, good temperature and obviously the taste was just...fantastic.I felt like I was eating in Japan.Among many, what stood out was the oxtail tongue, and the prime rib-eye steak. Hamburg was also great. If there was one which I could give input was the mayonaise in curry rice. It made the dish very heavy, which is fair because you'd eat the after the meal. Though it was too hefty for my taste.Price point is on the high side but for what you get is OK in my opinion.This place is good to dine with casual or romantic purposes.If you have the chance, give it a go

Delicious rump steak perfectly cooked, fresh salads and wonderful selection of wines to accompany the meal. Great selection of beef cuts from super pricey to more standard prices. Great ambience and service. The only thing I would have preferred was lighting a little less into eyes but we dealt with that issue with our hand towels. Would definitely go back for more

Nice place for a good Wagyu beef. A little pricey, but this meat is expensive anywhere you go. They also have burger if you more on a budget. Cool place to hangout, and well located on Unity Street at the Start of the Robertson Quay area. Good place to go with friends or colleagues for diner

This place is not cheap (can easily spend 100-200 SGD per head) but if you want great steak or burgers this is a good option. We ordered a steak and a hamburger and the hamburger was to die for.. Also not your run of your mill burger. The o my issue was that we only ordered that and a few glasses of win and the bill was just over 200 SGD which was quite a surprise for what we got. Would recommend for a special dinner or meeting business colleagues but not for a family dinner unless you have a few hundred sing to burn.

Ordered the Masa Combo. Price is definitely not cheap, but the quality of the Hamburg served justifies the price. Juicy in the inside and not overcooked, enjoyed the Hamburg steak with the demi-glace. Masa Original sauce was a little too salty for my liking. Tried the crab cake too, nicely done as well.
