We ate breakfast in this cafe for 2 mornings as we had vouchers from the hotel. Was basic but ok. Probably wouldn't have ate here but for the vouchers.

Perfect way to start you day with this local cafe which was just a few metres from our hotel. Breakfast was fantastic while we planned our days visits.

It was just a few doors away from my Hotel so It became one of my Favourite Places for Breakfasts and Quick Lunch whenever I was not Touring. It was quite liked I gather, because I have never seen it empty! I Recommend this Cafe to Other Tourist too

Whilst staying at the Fragrance Riverside, we had breakfast at Killiney each day of our three day stay. We were given a choice of three set breakfasts. One of which was a frankfurter, egg, hash brown, two slices of tomato and a slice of bread. Together with tea/coffee and a glass of orange juice.Not a bad breakfast

The Killiney CafÃ© in Hong Kong Street is one of a chain which have built up a well-deserved reputation for simple low cost meals. A limited choice, use of local favourites, self-service for the drinks and bright fresh little settings make these an ideal choice for breakfast
