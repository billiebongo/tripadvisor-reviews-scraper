A great spot for a lite bight before dinner and a quiet drink.
On a conference weekend hosted in this hotel, this was a great little break away for some down time..
Great pub style snack menu, great service.

I had a breakfast here and experienced tree things. The food is good, the service is not fast and they didn't tell you in advance that you have to pay for the breakfast. I just thought it was also available as complementary.

Yummy food, Enjoyed the setting.......cool & inviting, staff very helpful. Menu quite comprehensive and interesting.

We went here one afternoon to sit by the pool and have a snack with a couple of drinks. Staff were lovely and the satays and chicken wings were yummy.
2
The restaurant itself is quiet and beautiful, service is decent but the food was very disappointing and expensive.

Ate here on our first night in Singapore. We're staying at the hotel. Overly surroundings set by the pool area. Nice menu and very good food.
5
had a lovely lunch of various nibbles right next to the blue water of the pool just what we needede after a hot moring of sightseeing

The Blue Potato serves great food and drink and provides a relaxing atmosphere for families. Excellent staff, very friendly and professional.

4 stars for Blue Potato Restaurant :-Lunch was delicious. We had the satay pizza, chicken karaage burrito and fish & chips, paired with a complimentary bottle of Red Wine from Amex Platinum. Would have given 5 stars if not for the staff there given us wrong direction to this restaurant. Was at the pool bar and asked for direction to their restaurant (which is located next to the pool bar but ww didn't know!) but however was misleaded to the 1st floor instead of 2nd floor...

Even though we were late risers, the staff didn't seem to mind. We had breakfast here a number of times. The continental is more than enough to keep you going for hours. It is relaxing to sit by the pool and listen to the nearby waterfall. It's close to hand and private
4
Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday with my daughter. The rooftop and poolside restaurant was nice and quiet. The a la carte food was good. We had a romantic and unforgettable candle light dinner.
5
This is a lovely small restaurant located next to the pool, which is open day and night for food and drinks. I had a chicken satay pizza and it was delicious!!!! Staff extremely helpful and friendly.

For reasons I won't go into, we were given a complementary meal here, so you might think that I've given it unflinching praise for that reason. I haven't: I've given it what it deserved. We arrived to find that the waiter had already been told about our situation, negating the need for repetition and avoiding confusion, which was an encouraging start. Several reviewers commented on the ambience of dining next to the water with the splashing in the background, and yes, it is very nice, and the low light adds to the peaceful atmosphere and allows you to see out over the river to the lights of Clarke Quay. The service was confident and attentive, although I personally don't like being called 'sir'. The food was delicious. We were only given a choice of starters, and we both had the avocado salad, which was full of different flavours, from hazelnuts to berries. The main was chicken confit, which was superb, and the meal was rounded off with excellent ice cream and sorbet. We might not make it back before we head home this time, but we will certainly check that standards aren't dropping next year

this is around the pool the food and drink were fab and the staff were excellent really looked after us and welcomed us every dayeven gave my niece a birthday drink and cake ice crea

The poolside setting in the evening was lovely, with the sound of water features, dim blue table lighting, foliage and lights from Clarke Quay beckoning in the distance. However, I felt that food service was average. Pizzas not thin crust, and look more than half an hour to arrive. The bread rolls that other reviewers raved about were not offered because pizza is not 'main course'. However, the duck confit and kids fish and chips were good
4
Best fries in town !!!!✌️Nice ambience . Good serviceLong nice fries. Staff very pleasant . Quiet and cosy and good value for money

This is my first visit since I last visited two years ago. Some things have changed for this place. For one, the menu has changed - some of the desserts were gone (I miss the molten lava cake), some of the mains were changed (I can't find the ratatouille). But there were new additions - quesadilla is a new item. And there are the constants - kids menu remains the same, as with the appetizers.The service was great. The waiters offered bread rolls for us as starters, and even took care to attend to our needs if necessary. The food came very fast too - not as fast as fast food standards, but definitely within 15 minutes or so. Worth a try when the weather is cool, and not rainy
1
Give this a big miss, although the pool is nice. Little or no service whils at the pool, you need to go to the bar
5
We enjoyed two evening meals at the Blue Potato. We found the food tasty and the ambience restful. The service was very friendly and helpful
4
Nice terrace by the pool. Very nice ambient and service. The food was delicious. Mid-size menu including sandwiches, salads, beef tenderloin or pork rack. Also good menu for kids
5
We had a few meals at the Blue Potato. Service and food were very good. Meals were reasonably priced and they offer a kids menu.
5
Food is first class, service fabulous with great choice. lovely setting with the pool as a backdrop. A must
5
Great food but expensive. The Blue Potato is located by the pool at the Swissotel Merchant Court. It is convenient if you don't want to go outside the grounds to eat and the drinks are also more expensive than at venues along Clarke Quay.
5
Stay in or by the pool, enjoy a range of light foods and drinks. beautiful spot with views across to Clarke Quay
4
No need to leave the poolside -excellent service and wide range of meals,snacks and drinks from the waiter service bar
5
I'm a vegan and the restaurant catered for this very well. Drinks were not cheap, but reasonable for Singapore
4
We had breakfast here when we stayed at the hotel It has a lovely outlook over the pool and is nice and cool for an outdoor location. A good range of items for breakfast but a bit on the expensive side, however if you are staying at the hotel and want a quick bite before you get on your way this is the place
4
Restaurant by the pool for a very late lunch. Waiter was just amazing. The food was good . The grouper fillet was outstanding 
5
Poolside Restaurant and good choices on the menu.Ideal bistro restaurant to dine in if you do not wish to face Clarke Qua

Stark difference compared to its main restaurant in Merchant court hotel. That one is noisy, rowdy and questionable in terms of its cleanliness. This place is small, with a seating capacity of around 10 tables. Despite the size, it is equipped with a full size kitchen. Food are prepared fresh. Came on a Friday evening whereby the fun and upbeat music spills over from its neighbour - Clark Quay (spot know for bars and clubs entertainment).Ordered a Parma ham salad, slow cooked pork, and a BBQ pizza. Salad was interesting. Taste was not too bad. Sgd 20. Pork was tender, and of a sizeable portion. Sgd 48. Sauce was a tad too sweet. Pizza is nice, freshly baked and served with sliced parmesan cheese (upon request). Sgd 20. Feed@raffles members get 50% off when dining (2 pax). Drinks are at 25 % off. Had a Strawberry Margarita (ice blended), but came too sweet. I requested for a bit more alcohol or ice to dilute it and they offered to remake it. It was done perfect the second time round. Service is impeccable! Staff are always on the lookout and swift in action. If not for the hazy weather, I would have stayed on for a couple more drinks. Worth a try.

Had 75th birthday dinner last night. Soup was Yum! My wife had berry fruit salad which could feed at least two. My duck was very good. Service fine; French girl was great.
3
I found this restaurant to be a bit over-rated. Full marks for the presentation but the taste was not as great.
3
The Blue Potato provides an alternative to the very busy main resturant in the hotel. The food is good, and the service was good as it should be at the Swiss.
5
Nice setting poolside with fans to keep you relatively cool.
Service was excellent and the food was good. Menu has good choice of mostly western snacks. I found the drinks quite expensive as they are everywhere in Singapore.
3
We stayed in Swissotel Merchant Court in April 2014 and chose to eat breakfast and /or lunch here round the pool. Convenient poolside food with friendly staff and nice surroundings. Food was nice and staff friendly.
4
Had lunch there, salad was good, beer was cold! Sat in our bathing suits overlooking the pool, which was just beautiful.
When we sat at pool area, the staff did check on guests to see if they wanted any drinks. Nice!
4
Good option after a long day out. You can find much better and less expensive food in any of the hawker centres not far away.

Blue Potato is a hotel's restaurant of Swissotel situated on the board of the pool. In the evening it offers a very nice view and a relaxing atmosphere. It makes you feel very private, special and sometimes precious feeling in the city like Singapore. The service is extremely polite and requires a big thank you.Dishes are mostly European cuisine with standard like Ceasor salads, pizza, pasta, main dishes etc. I didn't have a chance to try the dessert but pasta was really good, perfect combination with a really delicious sauce (champagne, cream, truffle oil?). Price is higher than in other places I tried so far but it is also coming with a higher standard (service, meal, etc.)All in all, I recommend the place especially for the ones on the business trips, getting a bit home sick;
5
An outdoor restaurant next to the pool , which can be noisy when there are still children in it. The service and food, and the speed with which we were served (we had a flight to catch) couldn't be faulted. Watch out for the cute very athletic little squirrel that lives in the nearby trees
4
If you are staying at Merchant Court then you have to sit poolside at this relaxing bar. Staff was helpful and full of smiles and the tiger beer was extremely cold that commented the very hot day. Bartender even gave me an ice bucket to keep my beer cold
4
Food was to a great standard, menu had plenty of choice and the beers were ice cold. Great place for lunch or a quiet bar snack while your watching the world go by at the pool
4
service was great, food was very nice, and fresh. set by the pool which was a nice setting, there was very little weight time for our meal .
5
The food we ate from the blue potato was well cooked and delicious.
Would eat here again if we return to Singapore.
5
Good poolside restaurant for a snack whilst enjoying the very good pool facility. Good menu and drinks choice.
5
The staff are aware of gluten and I was able to have my meal modified. The service was great, the food good and it was pleasant dining by the pool.
5
A swim across the pool is as far as you have to go for a delicious lunch. The presentation of Caesar salad was enticing and the warm fresh bread roll yum. No better way to relax by the pool and recover from travelling.
5
We ate here on the 25th and enjoyed a superb Christmas buffet. I made my way through most of the dishes and everything I tried was absolutely superb - salads, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, ham, desserts everything was cooked, flavoured and seasoned to perfection. The staff were very attentive. Highly recommended
3
Ate here last night because we only wanted a light meal after travelling all day. We chose the fish and chips and enjoyed the food. The prices were as we expected for a hotel in central SINGAPORE. The bill came to Â£ 48 including 2 small Tiger beers. Not really value for money. Very handy situation when at the pool area. Very informal. Reasonably quick service from pleasant staff

I ate at this place the second time in October. The price of the food is similarly to what you can find in typical restaurants in hotels, although to me, the price may not be that reasonable given that this is a poolside restaurant (i.e. no aircon, so cost shouldn't be that high). Of course that is over-simplifying the pricing structure.Still on price, depending on what you choose, you get value for money. Kids' meals can come in quite significant portion (even to an adult). Pizzas can be a good choice for value - you get a regular (10 to 12 inch?) thin crust pizza for about $18 to $20++. Sides and appetizers are generally quite okay (we ordered nachos and it tastes great). The mains may be small in size - my wife's ratatouille is rather small in size for adults. I think I should have ordered the duck confetti instead.Still, the draw for me would be the setting of Blue Potato - by the side of the pool, with the sound of water. That can be quite a nice and serene environment to chill out and relax. It didn't occur to me until we finish our meal that we can actually swim in the pool while having our meal. I will factor that in during my next visit.All in, a nice place to hang out for a hot afternoon. Choose the right food for value though

Enjoyed the serene ambience of this place. Not all foods met expectations (especially the iced mocha with ice cream at $10)... However, the duck confit was worthy of its price of $30. They could be more generous with the sauce though! The desserts are pretty ordinary but reasonable at $10-$18.This was my 2nd visit and i hope to return soon if my schedule permits. Total bill about $140++ (inclusive of taxes) for 3 adults & 1 Toodler.
