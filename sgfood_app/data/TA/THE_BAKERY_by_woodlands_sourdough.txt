I love to come here for the awesome toast and coffee (hot latte). Great breakfast place next to the Botanic Gardens mrt, located at Serene Centre. A place for all sourdough bread lovers :)

Love the toast with different type of toppings. Also the fresh sandwiches changes daily with vegetarian options. Will be back for the Sunday pizza.

Amazing coffee by Cata Coffee and probably the best bread in Singapore. Pizza from 3pm to 6pm or “dough is out”

I've gone around most of the artisanal bakeries in Singapore looking for quality sourdough bread that is made just with natural fermentation with no commercial yeast and sugar added to the dough and there are very very few. This is one of them, and to me, it's one of the best I've come across. Do note that their crumb is slightly wetter as it is a high hydration sourdough. It will be harder to cut the loaf but it is normal. If you're looking for a plain old healthy loaf, my favourite would be the Seeded and Country loaves. But I really love them all.The Bakery is truly a gem - owned and run by a couple passionate about fermentation and hand-made, small batch quality produce. Most of the food is made from scratch, including their nut butters, hummus and granola, and their menu is always changing. Because of this, it's hard to give a recommendation. In the store you'll also find the passionate folks of Cata Coffee, who roast their own beans and create their own blends. If you come on weekend mornings, you'll have to prepare to queue for their food, but I can guarantee it'll be worth it! For toasts, I would recommend their nut butter honey and sea salt toast and sage cream cheese and berry compote toast. If you ever get to see strawberry balsamic brownies on display, snag them immediately before they run out! Rare treat :

Iced cafe latte had a strong coffee taste and silky milk texture which I liked.The Nut Butter + Honey + Sea salt toast had a generous serving of the spread/toppings but took 30 mins to serve even if there were just 5 customers at that time and 4 crew members, so wondered why it took quite a while. Also got one of their lunch sandwiches for 10SGD which was ok but a bit pricey for the taste

Be sure to come by early as they stop selling once their batch of the day runs out! I came by at 1pm on Saturday and there was only 3 or 4 options left that I could choose from.I loved the toast, it was sooo yummy! The toast was small but the spreads and toppings were so generous that it was worth what you're paying!I got the Vegemite, butter and cheddar toast and Egg salad Dukkah and Pickled Onion toast. YUM. Definitely coming back for more.Cheers

They have stopped slicing bread, so if you buy the whole loaf back home, expect to either chew off the loaf and tear it by hand, or spend an hour slicing thru a thick crust and risk cutting your fingers off in the process. No one buys a loaf of bread home for added inconvenience. Staff was not flexible, keeps insisting bread stays fresh for 3 days. I can understand it if it's to keep fresh in the shop. But people buy bread home so they can consume it, not to put up in pedestal for viewing.

This place simply proves that the food conquers it all, never mind the ambience, or rather the lack of it. It's called a cafe but the seatings are along the corridor of Serene Centre, with plastic tables and chairs. In the afternoon, you can even get a suntan. But nobody seems to care! That's the beauty of it. As the name suggests, they're famous for the sourdough bread. So they bake bread, cookies, brownies and serve special toasts that usually run out by 3pm (on Sundays). Tried the nut butter, honey and sea salt on sourdough bread. It's beautifully presented, with swirls of honey (see picture) The bread is chewy and sour, the nut butter sticky, with specks of sea salt and I think I need to try a second time to decide if I do like it. It's just so different. I didn't have a chance to try the other toasts as I'm usually too late. By the way they serve coffee too. Do try it if you're in the vicinity

... Because they sell out very quickly and only serve them on Sunday. They ran out of sourdough bread, their specialty, when we tried to order. We ordered their Margherita, filleti and bianca pizza. They smell good out of the oven, comes with fresh Ingredients, good cheese and dripping olive oil. The sourdough crust was unique but take a lot out of our jaw to chew through them. 3 pizza was too much for 3 of us, it was very filling

I'm slowly on my way to try all the toasts that they have to offer. All toasts are of the country loaf variety, but if you buy a whole loaf, you can choose from what they have on the shelf. I felt that since I last visited, the size of the toast has shrunk slightly, though.In order of preference: Hummus Za'atar EVOO ($4.00 nett) The Hummus was a MOUNTAIN! So generous & so deliciously creamy.Sage Cream Cheese Berry ($4.00 nett)My 2nd time eating this. I do like it & feel the creaminess of the cheese goes well with the slightly sour fruit compote.Nut Butter Honey with Sea Salt ($3.50 nett)The nut butter was creamy but not so strong on flavour. Tasted mostly of honey with a bit of saltiness at the end of every bite. Latte - Double Shot ($5.00 nett)Coconut Cold Brew ($6.00 nett)Was expecting a stronger coconut flavour from this, especially when I read "coconut cream" in the description. The coconut aftertaste was more similar to the coconut water sort. I preferred the Latte over the Coconut Cold Brew.Spelt Walnut Chocolate Brownie ($5.00 nett)Very sinful, good chocolate, great sticky consistency; but too sweet for my personal taste.
