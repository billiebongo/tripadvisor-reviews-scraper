Coincidentally passed by the shop during lunch hour and was attracted by the crowd of people. So, decided to give it a try. We ordered Tom Yum Seafood ($8) and Mango Salad ($6), both dishes are delicious.

The sour fish dish over a boiling plate is nice. I forgot what it's called. We had Tom Yam and pork omelette. They gave us prawn

We have been loyal customers to thai gold food since 2013 and they never disappoint! The food is great value for money, and is delicious. For authentic Thai food at a great price, come here!

This is a non-descript eatery on Bencoolen St which serves simple and delicious Thai food. You get the regular variety of noodles, rice and curry dishes here.
P.S. remember to bring cash

This restaurant is a go-to for that after class crave or post-office hours supper. I cannot honestly recommend any dish in this particular restaurant despite having dined in this restaurant on-and-off for a couple of years. All of the food items offered in this restaurant screams of a lack of sensory awareness, which in turn affects the ability to control the amount of salt, sugar, or oil placed into each dish. Although the deco of the place screams of a typical hole-in-the-wall Thai food joint, if you are looking for authentic Thai food, this is not the place to be

Returned here for another visit this week with a friend. We ordered 4 dishes (mango salad, green chicken curry, pad Thai, bean sprouts) and a Thai iced tea each. Cost was $35 in total which seemed reasonable. Good overall quality but somehow not quite as good as last time. Very busy at lunch.

Brought an overseas guest to have Thai food for dinner as near to the hotel. No problem in getting a table for two. We ordered tom yam soup, pork dish, Vege, and Thai fish cake. Food came quickly but I find that they are lukewarm rather than piping hot. The pork has a frozen type of smell which is a shame as was recommended by the waiting staff. Taste is home cooked though. The restaurant only accepts cash payment. Ambience is simple and tables are close to each other. No privacy basically. It is a place just to eat and go type hence no service charge nor GST

It's been a good 2 years since I was last here (and reviewed) and boy was I disappointed. Was just here for dinner on 22 July 2017, a Saturday and nothing tasted the same (save for their 1.own Chilli padis steeped in fish sauce-condiment, & 2. their Thai ice milk tea). Even the prices were adjusted (upwards) but with a pricier menu one will be expecting better foods, but that was not the case here. Not only were the portions slightly smaller, but it seems that none of the foods tastes as nice nor as authentic as I was last here. We ordered a fried rice, a fried vermicelli, a Tom yum talay (Tom yum soup with seafood) & a basil pork, and a Thai iced milk tea & iced lemongrass drink. First off the mains- nowhere near what we used to have. And we used to eat here very often like up to 4 times a week for almost a year, what kept me coming back was how good true to Bangkok flavours it was. Mains were $4-6 and now it's $5-6; less ingredients (yes even the rice & vermicelli used are less) and flavours are not as full-bodied due to the way it was prepared and seasoned). Perhaps the chef is different, I tried to console myself. Even the service was not as attentive and orders were getting mixed up all over the place. The next table that order fried rice too but had their orders taken later was served first. Then now you have to ask for the condiments yourself (twice) before being diverted to the next 'available' server, even if no other required service and nothing needs to be cleared. They used to bring them over once your first plate of food comes or at least they will ask if you need any condiments. Next the Tom yum talay: even my relatively unobserved boyfriend realised there's a marked decrease in the amount of ingredients in the soup, and how it's way less spicy and sour, and also the 'shortcut' way it was prepared as the difference in taste is really obvious, even if one can overlook the feeling of being shortchanged for the seafood being way less. The basil pork is still fine, but well it still is not as yummy as it was. Even the lemongrass drink is blander and doesn't pack as much of a punch, I mean even if it's made from syrup (yes there's quite a lot of places that uses lemongrass syrup incl gold Thai). Okay to be fair their drinks is priced at S$1.50 (kept same) so perhaps there isn't much to complain here, and their prices are all nett (no extra service charge & additional GST). So unless I'm in the area again next time and really craving Thai food, I really don't see myself coming back here anymore. It used to be the go-to place for me whenever I miss the good old Thai food I ate when I was in Bangkok for the first time, well, not anymore!

I'm really very happy with the quality of the food at this place. Some of the better Thai food available in Singapore and at very good prices. This visit we opted for a Pad Thai, a green chicken curry and a mango salad. Cost was only $22 and very tasty
5
We had the best green curry ! We strongly recommend this dish. We spent a while searching for the restaurant and we almost gave up we found it. There is nothing special about it and it can't be easily missed. The interior is quite simple but the food is great and cheap. I recommend it for a lunch between two attractions :

Came here for lunch today and ordered a mango salad, pad Thai, a red curry and some other chicken dish with 2 Thai teas. All quite tasty with very efficient service. Only $42 in total. Worth another visit.

This is a small restaurant that shouldn't be missed - - go early, it gets busy. It's not fancy dinning but the food is fabulous. It's mainly 'locals', so you know it's got to be great!

Excellent authentic Thai food, hearty meals, at super reasonable prices.You can smell the Thai basil and lemongrass a mile away.

Ok there is more fancy thai restaurant in Singapore but this one offers you authentic Thai food at a very reasonable price. Service is good and you do not wait for too lomg for ypur food. We will definitely come back to this central place. Price are reasonable and makes the food a very good bargain

Not bad at all! Hot, fresh, fast and reasonably priced if a little bit bland for such a vibrant cuisine. Only tried 2 dishes though so its pretty hard to tell. Would I come here again? If I was alone and fanied a quick Thai fix, certainly. With a group of friends, family or on a date? Probably not

We visited Thai Gold to make a change from the last two days eating at the hawker market . Despite it being quite busy we found a table and the service was good. They readily adapted a dish to accommodate my husbands taste. Portions were good However, as far as thai food goes it was fairly average , we have Thai friends and so are spoilt but it was good value

Been coming here since 2012 and always can't wait to come back for more. The thai ice milk tea may be too sweet for some and the thai ice lemon tea is different as they use those small sweeter lime. Always ordered 3 mains between me and my boyfriend, always tasty. Our favourites are the phad thai (fried noodles), phad woon sen (fried vermicelli), and the chicken char kway teow (fried thicker rice noodles). We have tried the bbq pork(savoury and slightly sweet), pork collar (crispy and chewy), and some others I don't exactly remember. The fruit salad is too sour for my liking so I only ordered that once. The green curry is pretty good and they are authentic thai flavours. I will recommend this over Nakhon Kitchen which I think is now overhyped. Gold Thai's flavours are more consistent, price wise too. There are times when I come here for lunch almost everyday when I used to work around the area. Try to catch the non peak timings and seating areas are not a lot to go around

This small restaurant is located in an isolated corner of Sunshine Plaza. It's quite crowded and during peak hours, people are waiting around for tables. Food is reasonably priced and authentic. However, it's not a fancy establishment.I had ordered bbq pork based on the picture on the menu as well as Tom Yum Goong and prawn with vermicelli in claypot. The lemongrass drink is really refreshing and not too sweet. Out of the three dishes, the bbq pork was not up to my expectation but the other 2 dishes are yummy. I ordered Thai red ruby for dessert and it was a bit sweet for me but I find that it goes well with the red ruby except that the portion is quite small
