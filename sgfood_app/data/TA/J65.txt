Had their international buffet lunch at promotional price 20.18++. Though the spread isn‚Äôt extensive but for this price it‚Äôs still a decent buffet. Worth a try for those looking for something simple and affordable.

Beautiful place with awesome Lobster buffet. Deserts are fabulous and with lots of variety.
Staff was very nice.

Food varieties and quality is good. Must try the lobster, snow crab and sashimi. Dessert also very nice and lots of varieties.

Was there with my family last weekend and we all had an enjoyable lunch. Service was good, our plates were cleared whenever we were done with our food. Some of the food like the herbal chicken was not replenished when I went to the station a few times, i was hoping to taste some. Overall I like their chicken satay, crab, fish and nian gao. When we left the female staff still greeted us with thanks and goodbye. I really like this kind of service - and so Ive booked my next staycation with Hotel Jen

If you‚Äôre not a fan of seafood the asking price of $55 is not worth the price. The food variety is alright, there‚Äôs sushi, rojak, seafood, chicken rice and laksa noodles and some roasted meats as well. Some Indian selection is there as well. Quality of the food is average at best as it feels like it‚Äôs been mass cooked for some event at the cheapest rate. I would recommend giving it a miss.

Food is not the only thing you look at when it comes to having a gathering together. This place has been good but I must say I was most disappointed recently and utterly embarrassed. 1. Food was not too bad but at only 7.30 pm, food was not replenished and there were not enough bowls, spoons to go around. Had to informed them to replenish the food and bowls. This kept happening and I am not sure if they were inattentive or what?2. I didn't understand why chili sauce need to be requested and it came in a whole Maggie bottle which was really below the serving standard. Was it costly to provide chilli sauce to go along with your food?3. It's nice to provide plain water but perhaps you can look at serving it colder otherwise it's literally drinking tap water. No point putting into a nice red bottle when it can't quench your thirst. I may sound picky but at the cost I am paying, surely you can serve me some decent cold water instead.4. Can you imagine my guests having to tell me at 8 plus that there is no dessert left, no spoons etc?5. Thank you for the complimentary car park and I am sure you can do better in terms of your service. I am sure you would want to maintain your standards of quality food and service too

Our family of 18 were there for our New Year‚Äôs Eve lunch. Food was excellent, huge selection of different cuisines including live-stations and the children enjoyed the varied desserts extremely.Services rendered was also exceptional. Special mention to Lovepreet and her team. They were welcoming, organised and very attentive. Jingyu was friendly, able to anticipate our needs without being intrusive. Recommended ..
4
The fresh lobsters are amazing. Impeccably fresh and served hot. Hot and Cold beverages were available. Have a wide spread of food. Plates are cleared as necessary but still not overly invasive. We could carry on our conversations without any problems.Everything is top quality, the service is outstanding and the whole experience is awesome. I will definitely go back

This review is not about the quality of the food at the sea food buffet but about the appalling organisation. This was our fourth stay at Hotel Jen and in order to avoid any chance of being told that there were no available tables at J65( as happened last year) we booked on line approximately three weeks before we arrived. Our booking was acknowledged by email. We arrived at J65 on time and our booking seemed to take an age to find on the computer. Eventually we were led away from the restaurant proper to a table in an adjacent bar area. The table had not been set for a meal. When we expressed our dissatisfaction, we were told that a large party of 300 guests had booked the restaurant. We were also told that an attempt had been made to contact on our mobile without success after which no further attempts to contact us were made. We asked why we hadn't been emailed or why a message hadn't been left at reception for when we checked in or with staff in the Horizon club lounge. No answer. We weren't prepared to sit outside the main restaurant so decided to eat elsewhere. We spoke to a very helpful member of staff at reception and a short time later a very apologetic assistant manager, Angelie Escobar, discussed the matter with us. She offered a table on the following day but we had already booked something elsewhere.Whilst we were very grateful to her for seeking us out and discussing the matter, the fact is that one attempted phone call was an insufficient course of action for the restaurant staff to have taken. Obviously this experience may well influence on our choice of hotel for our next visit to Singapore

Had a networking dinner - superb! Varied dishes cooked to perfection! Service was excellent. Prime rib of beef and singapore chilli crab the best!
5
I highly recommend trying this restaurant, definitely one of the better buffet is the city. Food is fresh and and lots to choice from.
3
Great Bargains. Attracted by the price $52 for 2 pax. Choice of food is limited. Nothing worth to mention the food except the staffs are attentive.
5
Staffs are super attentive! every requests was fulfilled and small details was noticed without any prompt! everyone enjoyed ourselves there was the most important key when we dine out!
Everyone gave thumbs up to the food dessert and staffs!

I went for Sunday brunch with my family members. This buffet restaurant looks more beautiful than photo reviews. The dining ambience is good but the food were below average. The 1st round of satay was nice but the taste dropped when had the 2nd round, maybe grilled 'faster' to cater for more guests. Saw a lady chef was defrosting the 'satay rice ' so after 30 mins went back for it & was told by a male chef that no 'satay rice ' served during the brunch. Are those 'satay rice ' reserved for dinner? The Chinese roasted pork meat looked 'dark' & it seems was left overnight or even longer & the pig skin was not crispy at all. Chicken rice tasted blend. Too bad chilli crab without mantou. Western soup not warm. Chinese herbal chicken soup was too bitter. Either the herbs not proportioned correctly or didn't add salt. Not much cooked food. The cold seafood like lobsters & prawns were ok, without stale smell. The only commendable food section was the desserts. Nice pastries, cakes, ice-cream, almond pudding, etc. The ice-lemon tea was good. So far, it's the best of all the 5* hotels. Hotel staff service was commendable too for fast clearing plates. I will surely patronize this restaurant again, not for the mains but for the desserts & dining ambience

@TheKuoKnowsI haven't been to J65 since it changed its name from Traders. But I now wish I had come back sooner.J65 is as good today as it was all those years ago. The lobster offering was a feast on its own. I get the impression that some diners only go there for the tasty crustacean.......... No sooner are the pink shelled delights brought out from the kitchen than they are whisked away by hungry eaters.The sushi and sashimi were pretty good too, as was the selection of shellfish, crabs and prawns. The strong emphasis on things from the sea was reinforced with a baked trout - what a catch.But J65 is not just about things that swim and creatures that crawl on the ocean floor. The Chinese roast meats are fab. The Western roast joints are superb. And the desserts are fantastic.J65 is on my list of go-to places. Can't wait to go back again
4
I would say this is one of the more under-rated hotel buffet restaurants in Singapore. It has been relatively empty most of the time I've gone, surprisingly. After its recent renovation, J65 is brightly lit with a nice, relaxed ambience. The spread is also very good, with a wide range of colds, hots and desserts. The salmon sashimi isn't as fresh as some other places, but quality for most of the dishes is good
5
Like the ambience, quiet and the staff was friendly & approachable. Service was good, clear our dirty plates promptly. Lobster was very fresh & sweet. Had a few servicing. Salmon sashimi was good. Roast beef was tender, their pork knuckles was crackling. Hehe! To sum up, highly recommend this place. Oh! They served very good tea. Like the sock Tea in Hong Kong.
2
Attracted by the descriptions and mentioned of the local spread at a pretty attractive price of S$52.00++ for 2 diners.Atmosphere is pretty cosy with funky posters/ wall appearance. Not crowded at all, in a way good with lesser crowd thus lesser noise.Well well the spread isn't much to crave for. Not a huge variety but suffice if spread was appealing. The fried Chinese carrot cake was cold at the food service counter next to the satay.Nothing worthy to mention about the food except that service staff were attentive and courteous.Will give this place a miss since there are many other options available around the same price. No complimentary parking coupon issue unless your bill is at least S$200/- and above
5
The emphasis here is on local food - meaning Singaporean (chicken rice, satay, laksa, braised duck, carrot cake). But they also have indian, chinese, japanese and western selections. We were spoilt for choice. it was extremely good value. The only minus was that our reserved table was illegally occupied by people celebrating a birthday party to place their gifts balloons etc on. We told the staff that we'll make do with a smaller table and just squeeze in. Kudos to the staff for being apologetic, and re-seating us mid way into the meal once a bigger table was available
4
Have patronize this place 3 times. Love the spread especially the satay and laksa and the varieties of pastries.
4
The service from the staff is excellent. They are very pro active.
The food is an excellent mix of Western and Asian food. All the food was fresh and topped up regularly.
I consider it great value for money.
5
Great food and excellent service. Food was topped up regularly and attentive staff, namely Vernice, Soloman and Eli, provided us with an extremely engaging dining experience.
3
Would not say it is a totally local buffet. Has Indian corner, cooking corner serving noodles, satay, fried carrot cakes and chicken rice.
Variety is enough and quality is also alright. Appetizer and dessert are the weakest link.
5
Good spread of local food. Good deserts. Nice environment with friendly staff. Price is reasonable and is located in a good area.

4 of us tried the so call weekend "seafood mania". We were disappointed with the spread. The theme "seafood mania" gave us the impression that there would be a big spread of seafood with different styles however the spread was very limited. Besides small sized lobsters, snow crab legs, black mussels, oysters and prawns. There's no different cooking style for some of the seafood which we would like to see that would make it as a seafood mania theme at all. The sashimi selection is also limited to salmon sashimi only while other buffets have tuna, yellow tail, octopus slices. There was chilli and pepper crabs but runs out very quickly. The dessert variety is average and was not patisserie standard if i were to compare with other buffets. For the price of S$75++, it is not worth it at all. The service of clearing the plates were pretty slow. We had to keep calling the waitresses to remove the plates. There was a promotion of 25% off at the point of dining. We will not return because the food variety is disappointing although the freshness of the food was ok. It was not crowd at all showed how "popular" the buffet was compare with other buffets
4
My first time in J65 and Hotel Jen. Their buffet joint at the ground level delivered one good dining experience for me. It wasn't the food options (there are other buffets with wider spread), but rather the service of the staff including their replenishment frequency. Very nice meat station - roast beef, roast pork, chicken and others. There was the Chinese cuisine corner and the Japanese sushi and sashimi area. Salads, stews, soups and many others. But the best come on for me was the seafood options. On Seafood Mania night (Fri to Sun), and for 75++, there is unlimited crab, prawns, crayfish, oysters and more seafood.Desserts of cake, ice cream, fruits and more sweets are perfect meal enders. You'll never go wrong with J65 buffet.
5
Celebrated my son 2nd birthday in J65 with seafood buffet dinner. Love the atmosphere and surrounding. A very bright restaurant and tables are not very near. Love the food varieties and the local delicacies. Staffs are friendly and quick in responding. Would like to suggest that it will be perfect if in future the restaurant can provide a booster seat for toddler. Is for child that cannot fit into a highchair and too small size to sit on a normal dining chair.
4
We were there on a Saturday to enjoy the super seafood dinner buffet. Plenty of oyster, Alaska crab claws, prawns...etc which are very fresh. The salmon sashimi was super fresh and in thick slice which is very satisfying. The buffet spread was top up regularly. Staff were attentive and friendly. Clearing of plates were swift.Quite value for money
4
For the price you pay for, this place is heaven. Food were nice. They have local and western cuisine. Both the servers and chefs were impeccable. One of the head chefs were around to greet us, to which I appreciated a lot. If only the fresh seafood counter would have more varieties, then this place would be perfect. Nonetheless, I will definitely come back for round 2
4
I am not from Asia but was here on travel. Ate at J65 for breakfasts and lunches during a work trip. The variety was good - we had a very diverse group of attendees and everyone found something, and everything was clean.
5
Quick reservation over the phone
Not crowded
Loved the DIY Yu Sheng
Wide variety of food - pork knuckle, ribs, baked salmon, oxtail, sea bass... Really good stuff
Good service
5
i used the restaurant for lunch and dinner I chose the buffet option the choice was fantastic seafood to local cuisine there was plenty for everyone I would reallyrecommend a visit if you're nearby
5
Whether you're rushing for business or family fun, J65 offers plenty of options that will satisfy the most picky eaters. Fill up here first and get going. We ate here four days and the Singapore Laksa was heavenly. The other choices are also good. I had some stale coffee from one of the machines on one morning but the other machines were good so perhaps an oversight on the part of the staff filling the beans. Small matter but easily resolved with the friendly and attentive staff
5
Stopped into this place as it was close to the mall I was shopping at and next to my hotel The Regent. Ordered the curry Laksa (chicken and prawns) and have to say it was THEEEE BEST curry Laksa I have EVER had (and I've tried a few world wide). Presentation was also excellent. It was a late dinner and the restaurant was quiet. The staff were a little nonchalant but polite. The buffet looked good but I didn't want to spend $60sgd approx for it. The Laksa was adequately filling and I'm glad I didn't have the buffet in the end.
2
I have been to this restaurant numerous times as I find that the price is ok and the service is very good. However my recent trip here last Friday really disappointed me and I do not think I will be back again. I called up days before to check on a voucher whether it's still usable. The staff on the line confirmed that yes it is still usable and I made a reservation. The type of food served seemed to have less variety as used to be however service is still top notch. When I asked for the bill, the staff highlighted to me that the voucher can't be used anymore. It was upsetting as they had told me in front of my guests which was embarrassing. They asked me like time and date that I called and I showed them my call log. But in the end, they were still unable to honour the voucher which I was told during reservation that it is still valid. They were only able to offer me a 30% discount and one of my child did not need to pay. It was a good gesture on their part however it was really a bad experience as I only came because the staff had told me that the voucher was usable. I will probably not be back again
5
While we were astonishingly full to the brim after Sunday buffet lunch at J65, every bit of calorie was worthwhile with the gorgeous spread, neverending. From starters and salads, through to the main course of meats, roasts, and even the irresistable oysters, every offering was tantalising and tasted really really delicious. Staff were especially helpful and provided tender loving care to all diners. A really good experience. And a really full belly
5
We booked J65 as a venue for our wedding dinner with just a group of 15 guests. It was a good decision as the staffs from the point of booking to the actual day are very accommodating and attentive. J65 offers wide buffet spread and all delicious! We love the salmon, pork knuckle, crab, prawn, lobster, crispy squid, etc. Free flow of iced tea. First serving of soda is free, succeeding are chargeable. Ice cream could have been better if more option and not the popsicle type (this is just a small issue). All our guests enjoyed and shared same compliments. Overall, would love to be back again.
4
There is a reasonable variety on the menu, the menu seems to be designed so that most people can find something they would like. The food was done well and the staff are friendly. If your group finds it hard to please everyone this may suit you. It is located inside Hotel Jen
4
My colleagyes and I visited this restaurant last December. The food are nice. There are variety of choices. The ambiannce of the place is nice and cozy for friends to bea able to talk freely and not shouting at each other as it is not noisy. The service crew are also great in catering your needs. They are quick to respond.
3
Staff are efficient and friendly. The buffet variety and quality both are of average standard. It was suppose to be a seafood themed buffet but the seafood displayed was just the supporting cast of a movie.
4
If you are enjoying the environment, this is the best place i ever had. big and comfortable space. however varieties of foods was limited and menu not update from time to time. i enjoyed dine in for christmas gathering with group of friends.
3
I was expecting there to be more varieties for lunch buffet but was disappointed on the selection. Service was excellent and friendly staff i must say.
4
We went there on new year's eve. We're really satisfied with the variety and quality of the food. The lobster and snow crab is great. Roast beef is good too. The ice cream is great too.
4
Was in the hotel for 4 nights and had J65 for breakfast. The laksa is one of the best I have ever tasted and would recommend anyone who comes to try it out.
5
The buffet is one of the best I have ever seen it caters for everyone with a choice of a carvery, Indian,Chinese and Malay dishes plus fresh seafood including lobster,crab claws and giant prawns. Great choice of desserts plus Ice Cream and Lollies for the young ones. The service is top quality and the staff are helpful and friendly
5
Pretty yummy for our first day, first dinner, before facing a big meeting on the following day.My Singapore Laksa was served in a very large bowl (oval shape) - what a delicious coconut milk soup sauce, along with the white noodle, beansprouts there was large fresh shrimps! Tasted to my liking. With such a generous helping! My friend's Nasi Goreng tasted really good too. What we ordered were perfect for quite a filling dinner, when you are hungry after a whole evening shopping in Orchard Road! Friendly staff too. I like this place

We had our Boxing Day dinner here for buffet dinner. The cold seafood here is just average . The texture of the Alaska crab legs are not smooth and fresh enough. The prawn is a bit better. The hot dishes are nice. The variety of desserts are quite considerable but we can't find tiramisu surprisingly. Overall it's nice environment and not crowded and not noisy for enjoying the dinner 
3
Wanted a quiet Christmas brunch with hubby so decided to try j65. The turkey was pretty good they had two types, we preferred the traditional one.The boston lobster was a letdown though. Didn't feel good eating it, didn't feel too good after eating it either.They have a lovely presentation for the Christmas sweets. Very delightfully decorated but didn't find anything truly impressive. Interesting was they had durian puree which i found really good! Nothing Christmasy.Worth trying was the satay, the meat was juicy and tasty. Not the oyster omelette singapore style though, the hawker centres does it better.Santa Claus came around but no presents for adults. The Christmas atmosphere was pretty okay with crackers for each guest. Probably a place to bring your children.Overall didn't find the food worth the price, but I may have gone with high expectations
5
great service, but variety and quality of food wasn't that great. celebrated a birthday and we were given a slice of cake. thumbs up!
3
The price for two Pax is only cost $65 ,so the price is quite reasonable but the choices are very limited.
5
Food was amazing so was the service. Even prepared a birthday cake for the birthday cake and surprised her!

Came here for a buffet dinner and my friend had a 50% discount cardThe selection is pretty good with both local , western and eastern choicesQuality is good, and i find the local options were done better than the western or eastern ones. The DIY kueh pie tee was the standoutService was o
4
Been here many times, all for celebrations, and never once they failed us. Food quality good. Choice of food very good. Service level very good. Once, the waitress even took the initiative to prepare a last-minute cake for us when she found out we were celebrating my daughter's birthday. My reservation was done via chope. No problem at all, everything was prepared for eg, baby chair and all. They will provide complimentary parking as well. Space in between tables was spacious and good. Went to some hotel buffet where it felt so cramp. Will definately come back again
4
Although the dinner buffet which I have with my family was on a local theme, the spread also included Japanese sushi and sashimi freshly prepared by the chefs. The local cuisine which I enjoyed very much were the wok fried chilly crabs that were meaty and fragrant with special spices. Also for dessert, my family loved the durian purees as they were very refined and just right in its sweetness. Overall we felt that the buffet is worth going for another time
4
the place has a very good ambience, food is very good as it has different options. However I was a just bit disappointed when I found out there was no promo for DBS card because I thought there was as per email I received from Chope. It stated it has credit card promotion. The following is what has been indicated in the email. anyway it was not a bad experience after all. I was only expecting because of what has been indicated in the email. But this will not discount my approval for the good ambience and good food. PROMOTIONSCredit Card Promotions3rd diner dines free for DBS, POSB, UOB, Maybank and AMEX credit card holdersTerms and conditions as follows:- Advanced booking required- Not valid with other offers or promotionPromotion period: until 31st Dec 201
4
A good selection and wide variety of food and cuisines for a buffet which was expected for a hotel. The chefs were always on hand to tidy up the 'displays' or even recommend which to try. We were celebrating my wife's birthday which was acknowledged with a complimentary birthday cake and greatly appreciated! The waiters were not at taking orders due to language barriers, however the managers made up for the weaknesses.Very reasonable prices and children friendly. The hotel d√É¬©cor was great and made the atmosphere feel 'chic-boutique' - very relaxed and could've spent all evening there if we hadn't eaten too much
4
A very nice ambience with a good buffet display. Very good variety and overall, quite splendid. We liked the roast beef, seafood chowder, pohpiah, herbal prawns, Chinese roast pork, wanton noodles, lamb bryani. The lobsters, prawns and oysters were also quite acceptable. And very importantly, plentiful. Service was good too. The staff member attending to us was a lady from Punjab, Ms Maurdeep Kaur I think her name is; she was very attentive and cleared our plates with a smile.Some issues: the pepper crab appeared not very fresh, so we only had one piece. Generally, the desserts were not as good as the rest of the food. There was a mango ice cream that was very nice, but unfortunately, it was not replenished. I felt the Kueh lapis was a bit too dry.We are quite happy and are likely to return
5
The breakfast was included as part of our stay at the Jen tanglin. Being vegetarians we were unsure of the kind of fare we would get but rest assured, we had an awesome time here. The variety was massive and sufficient choices for vegetarians were available with even a few Indian vegetarian options. Plenty of fruits/salads/ excelent coffee station which served an awesome hot chocolate and lovely selection of breads and cheeses. Since the hotel is newly refurbished (when we visited), it was sparkling with an awesome ambience and buzzed with lots of patrons. We enjoyed our meals here thoroughly
4
Overall, pretty good except for the fact that the lobster was not replenish fast enough for the crowd. Variety is good. Ambience is OK. Staff are friendly and I've got the 2 for 1 deal using UOB card.
5
Food Spread are for the price. Topping up of food are fast especially the seafood area. Service staffs are friendly however are a little slow in clearing the plates.. Recommended place.
4
With the price paid its a good variety. Taste wise is good especially the singapore laksa, pizza. The desserts are decent. Staff are very friendly and accomodating.
4
We have visited this restaurant numerous times before the renovation. So this was the first that we went after it was revamped. We went on a Monday which was offering the Crab buffet. It was good, many choices of crab cooked in various methods. Most importantly was the crab were fresh and they are the real crabs, not the flowery crabs which are cheaper and doesn't taste that good. Then they had the noodle station, serving the laksa which my guests were saying it tasted good. There was also fried omelete, pohpiah, rojak and best of all durian pengat. But 1 thing was the replenishment of food was pretty slow. The salmon plate and durian pengat was cleared pretty fast and it took awhile till the next ones were served. One of the waitress knew that we were celebrating my little one's birthday and quickly went into the kitchen and took out a small ice-cream cake. Very nice of them as I didn't inform them beforehand but she took the initiative.Felt that they were quite shorthanded as seemed like there were only 2 staff around. But all in all, the service was great. This is not our first time and definately not our last time
4
The family was there to celebrate my dad's birthday. It was one of my dad's fave restaurant to dine in. We haven't been there since it was revamped. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Service staff was excellent though I did not get their names. Foodwise, it could be further improved.
4
I visited J65 on Sunday evening for the dinner buffet with my family and it was on a local hawker theme. I liked the tasty Singapore laksa which is spicy souped rice noodles with prawns, sliced fish cake and hard boiled egg. There are great variety of local food like chilly crabs, Hainanese chicken rice, satay, fried egg omellete with oysters, durian purees. Besides local food, the buffet also includes Japanese sushi, Western oven baked beef, seafood on ice and assorted desserts. It is truly valued for money at S$55+++ per diner.
4
the lobster, oysters and salmon sashimi were very fresh. I liked it that they bring out a little at a time, to ensure freshness but there was enough to satisfy hungry diners. the cooked food section delivered as well -satay, chilli crab, porridge, popiah, rojak, oyster omelette to name a few. Dessert spread was okay.I loved the mango and mocha ice cream. also the herbal jelly as well.We went in July and there was a promotion. UOB 30% off total bill or DBS, Amex or UOB 3 for 2
5
Breakfast was included in our stay and so we ate here. The buffet was expansive with tons of variety. Being Indian vegetarians we normally do face issues with sufficient choices traveling abroad but this was not a a problem here and we ere able to enjoy the buffet thoroughly. being newly refurbished, the restaurant area and the lobby were sparkling clean, ambient and lively and was such a pleasur
4
This is one of the best hotel buffet in town especially the Seafood Mania on Friday or Saturday evening. Highly recommended for tourists who want to taste local delicacies in the same place or locals to indulge in wide seafood spread such as Boston lobster, oysters, mussels and salmon sashimi at a reasonable price
3
There was a bit of disappointment at first when the restaurant said it didn't have our reservation. This was despite me calling a few times after making the reservation on Chope a week earlier - the phone seemed to be always engaged!But after a short 'chit chat' with the manager, we finally got things sorted out. The food and all was really decent for the DBS promotion that was going on then.
4
I had Dinner (buffet) and breakfast there. Dinner was great and well priced ($35 for hotel guests). Breakfast was very ordinary.
2
See the attached pictures taken at 1:30pm for what was called a Sunday lunch/brunch! It speaks by itself...Poor service by not pro waiters from India who were not even able to open our bottle of low end wine, horrible food (worst than any food courts in this city) and not fresh oysters.Run away, a pure scam for tourists sleeping in this old hotel.We wasted money and time..
4
Wife and I came for a buffet dinner in May 2016.Location-----------+ Fairly centrally located at Hotel Jen (the old Traders Hotel), Tanglin Mall, on the more quiet end of Orchard Road. Nearest MRT station is 10min walk away (Orchard). Alternatively, there is a shuttle bus to and from Orchard MRT (near Wisma Taxi Stand). + Parking was not a major issue although each level only has a few lots (i.e. car need to climb multiple ramps). Parking rates were:MON-FRI before 5/6 PM : $2.40 for 1st hr, $1.20 for next subsequent 30min from 7am to 5pmMON-FRI after 5/6 PM : $3.50/entry from 5pm to 7am the following daySAT : Charges same as weekdays, but $3.50/entry after 1pmSUN / PUBLIC HOLIDAYS : $3.50/entry from 7am to 7am the following dayFood-------+The spread was pretty good, with a good emphasis on Nonya Peranakan food.+ My recommended favourites were the cold crab claws, salmon sashimi, hot spicy Kung-pao prawns, baked scallops. + Dessert spread included chocolate cakes, tarts, Japanese mochis, Indonesian Kueh Lapis ("thousand-layer" cakes), Green Tea pudding, Osmanthus jelly, ice-cream, etc.Design---------+The place was spacious with good circulation space. Tables are placed wide apart.+Aesthetics were modern and pleasing.Overall, a good place for a business, romantic or family meal
3
Has always wanted to try the food here. The seafood...only the prawns was ok other tasted bland. Wasn't impressed with the baked salmon..was not deboned. The butter curry was a little salty. The chicken rice was nice not oily but the chicken and pork was dry. The laksa was the highlight for me. The deserts was so lala last. Overall. It wasnt bad but it didn't do it for us
3
I was here for a weekday buffet lunch at 29++pp. To be fair, this price is truly a bargain for a hotel buffet. Overall, there was a considerable spread of mainly Asian food. The chicken rice was average (chicken was dry), satay was good, roast pork and laksa was average. The kueh pie tee was the winner. It was really good. As for seafood, only prawns and mussels were offered for lunch buffet, plus some sushis. There was no sashimi in sight, which was a great disappointment for us. To be honest, we were quite surprised because many blogs and reviews we read for weekday buffet had mention of sashimi, so we were quite bugged by it. So if you want sashimi, come during the weekends. Desserts were average. The cakes were slightly stiff and hard, the Potong ice cream they offered had corn, jack fruit or chendol. I took the jack fruit and it was delicious. Overall, I find the lunch buffet value for money. But I was very disappointed with the service provided by the staff. They were not very friendly when they serve you food or clear your plates, in fact they looked unhappy, wasn't sure is it because they are understaffed. They were just very fixated on getting things done, not very customer friendly oriented, something I guess which is very important in the service sector. I probably will not come back again.

Free flow of lobster, snow crab, prawn, Sri Lanka crab, oysters and salmon sashimi, thats only the seafood spread; adding local delights such as chicken rice, indian curry, rojak, char siew, po bia, and Chinese noodle bar to boost the variety of taste. Plus, there are cold and hot drinks without additional charge. Interior is modern and delightful, a good place for friends or family to gather around. The only one drawback is if you intended to collect GC points, you will need to advise the membership number while payment; the points are not retroactive

Was there for their buffet lunch with my wife. Best value for the food variety that was available. Both the hot and cold dishes were definitely above average in standard. The salmon sashimi was thick n fresh, not to mention the lobster, crabs and oysters took.Sampled all the hot food and must said the chef's did a great job with the dishes, especially the salted egg yolk prawns (total delight!) Special mention to Alice who attended to us. She was really professional and did a flawless job with her service and smile. Hotel jen tanglin is definitely still one of my top picks for hotels in Sg

good breakfast spread. varied. tasteful. decent ambience. good service.the only issue is that there was a queue in the morning to get a table. now, that is a drag for residents at the hotel, hoping to finish a quick breakfast and rush to morning meetings

The spread for the breakfast Buffet was better than what I have experienced in 5 Star hotel. They office Hainan Chicken and Roast Chicken with rice if you care to start lunch during your breakfast. Also with a choice of 3 different noodles soup! They have the other normaly pastries and western fares but the surprising item is the Ice POPS. They offer red beans, sweet corn or yam ice pops, made like the old styles when ice cream bicycles use to come around the village days.The staff are very helpful and courteous. Supervisors and Managers on the prowl all the time so service always high quality

One of the best value buffet with Asian delights complimented by the awesome array of seafood delights. Think Boston lobsters, oysters chilli crabs and so much more. Live cooking station whips up declicious servings of roast meats. Satay and oyster omelette are also freshly made. There are also salads to help balance out the goodies. Great selection of desserts whIch includes premium ice cream and the indulgence, Durian penga

If you are staying at jen tangin hotel try breakfast here. The big selection of continental, american breakdasts, fruints, bakery, cheese and traditional chinees dim sums (dumplings)

Had dinner on March 16 with my family. Found the food so-so only .. nothing special
except myself enjoying to the Penang Laksa only. variety was not fantastic .. would be good to have more fresh fruits. a little disappointing.

Initially was a little apprehensive when told that the restaurant was fully booked for the night's buffet dinner but if we are willing they can set up a bar table with high chairs rather than the normal height tables. As we had been to their buffet numerous times even before their change of name, we decided to risk it and proceed. Barbara who took our bookings was very polite, informative and helpful.Needless to say the buffet spread was very generous, replenishment was done quickly and their service impeachable. Kudos to Ms Barbara and her team of servers! By the way, the bar table and chairs was an experience and surprisingly very comfortable!

Went there in my wife's birthday. I must say the variety was good and very well presented but quality is not good. Things are either too salty or sweet. However, staffs were extremely helpful and their service was great. Unfortunately for the food, it would be a good place for gathering

Had a weekday lunch buffet with a colleague. At first look, we were very impressed with the spread and could find most food choice desirable; for S$29++ you get Salmon Sashimi, sushi, western choices, local choices (Kueh Pie Tee, curries), ala minute laksa, fresh to cut chicken rice, satay and waffle with ice cream etc etc..We sat down and was preparing to totally enjoy ourselves.. And then the disappointment starts... - Salmon Sashimi not fresh, sliced very haphazardly- Sushi was done long time ago, so they are all hard to chew. The tamago on mine tasted sour- Kueh Pie Tee has no taste, the DIY counter for it was messy and sticky. No one was topping up the vegetables. No place allocated to place the cover of the claypot while you try to balance everything.- All asian hot dishes are either bad or bland. Laksa was a long wait and looked promising, but it was a thin coconut soup, lacks punch.- Chicken rice was cold and somewhat not completely cooked, still had blood at bones. Chicken Rice was tastelass- Chicken satay they were BBQing like 10 sticks each time, too slow to match the crowd. I ended up with only 2 pieces after visiting the stall 3 times. Fresh so nice, gravy was tasty.- Waffle mix was not good, so it turned out cakey- Peach tea and Ice lemon tea was a syrup mix, sweet and undesirable. Though I applaud the idea of free drink with the buffet- Western desserts was cakes and some mousse, total let down. Even the pandan cake was a joke (to locals)- Had a kueh dada, ok lah... not bad not good either.- My colleague had a jackfruit potong ice cream stick. She said that was good.Service: Service staff was spontaneous and friendly. Although their English is not so good, I could feel that they were genuinely trying to create small talk. This is confidence and I could account that to good training. So, good job there! There was a filipino girl in jacket, I think she is a manager. Now, she has to start showing some smiles, instead of the straight pan face. An indian male gentleman in jacket, came around when we are almost done and asked how was the meal. I didn't share my feedback with him, as I do not want to look as if I am looking for a freebie.So verdict: It is not acceptable to do a local buffet that is not good. The food quality seriously lacks taste check. This is really the killer. If the dishes were good, I think the place should be packed day after day, for a good value, extensive spread. Food quality is really the missing link.So nope, will not be back, unless one day the food gets better and fresh

The staff were very friendly and helpful except the cashier. She was not very friendly. Disappointed that there was no roast pork and the char siew was not tasty, very porky on 22 Apr 2016.We liked the satays , salmon and prawns best! We liked the pizzas least, too much pastry

J65 located in Hotel Jen located in Tanglin is a wonderful, family-friendly buffet. I ate at J65 for Brunch, and there was a wide variety of delicious, colourful food.One of my highlights is definitely the Japanese buffet, where a wide variety of sushi and sashimi were served. There were plenty of seafood, including crab and fish. I have noticed that J65's speciality is probably their local food. They served many roasted delights, such as char siew and chicken rice. They also have a wide range of Southeast Asian deserts. J65 also has an excellent salad bar, filled with greens and lots of couscous. However, this restaurant is more catered towards Asian food, rather than Western Food. There is a bit of a lack, thus making it more of a Southeast Asian+Japanese+Salad buffet.Several things to improve: I hope the buffet will start providing some more Western foods and more drinks. The only drinks were pineapple juice and a very sweet apple tea.Overall, a wonderful restaurant and I will definitely go again

I've been here twice, first time was in March the food is good with lots selection and service was great so a month later I booked it for my husband's bd 3 weeks in advance when I rang them on the day they said they couldn't find my booking. Imagine I have 16 guests on the list and didn't know what's going to happen luckily they said they are not so busy that day so I can come. When I got there I know why they are not busy they had dropped their standard. Not many choices for food selection, the oysters ran out after 15 mins even though they only put out a tiny bit. No cold cut meat,no cheese,no roast meat I asked them what happened and they said they had changed the menu. The service was also poor I have to asked to top up my drink and for all the guests giving that we were there for free flow champagne but I don't think we get what we paid for

My wife and I ate here towards our most recent stay at the Hotel Jen.We both decided upon the a la carte menu rather than the buffet for two reasons: we both had decided earlier that we wanted a decent steak, and the buffet was seafood themed and I don't enjoy seafood (or its reaction in my system).The restaurant was busy, and I think my wife and I were the only ones not having the buffet. This may be the reason that the head chef himself cooked and delivered our steak dishes - which were superb. Cooked exactly as ordered and accompanied by perfectly cooked vegetables. Nothing at all to fault.The restaurant staff were busy but gave the impression of being unhurried - which added to the relaxed atmosphere.I did give them a little task to accomplish in that I requested a beer that is normally only available in one venue within the hotel complex (the upstairs bar, Rumpoles) and they passed the test with flying colours - in fact, the restaurant manager himself ran up the stairs to fetch me the beer. My wife's wine was excellent as well.Would I recommend J65? Yes.Will I return? Yes

J65 marketing done well online after the new branding! All the hype online about the Sunday Brunch. Arrived and the food quality is not too bad, food spread is so so. Comparing to the past, we really expected more after the new branding. Probably the expectation they set online was too high, all the hype going on by bloggers and Facebook, we have expected a lot more. Great place for family and friend to hangout too! Live band is an absolute disappointment, not our style cause we got sick of the singer's voice. He didn't really helped us to enjoy the ambience, really!! Oh! Something they need to work on. Service! There's only one poor girl clearing plates and we need to constantly remind her to do so. That's an important factor especially when we we talking about buffet restaurant, guests take their food and return with a table filled with their used plate. Even when we are calling for our bill, we booked through the website with 15% discount, but were labeled on our receipt as "walk in guest". Mmmmmm..........
