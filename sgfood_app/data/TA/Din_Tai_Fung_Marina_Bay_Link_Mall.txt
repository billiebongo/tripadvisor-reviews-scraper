Service is prompt and food good every time. Pork chop on fried rice is a must try. Of course the xiao long pau in any form is good here with the chilli sauce by the side
5
This chain of Din Tai Fung has succeeded in provided the same level of satisfaction of dining no matter which resturant you attend. The only issue is the wait: every outlet has a line some longer than others. But trust me it’s worth the wait
4
I've tried the original in Taipei, and this one in Singapore. Both were good, but this one is in a mall, so the atmosphere is completely different.
The food was as nice though.

We dined here on the recommendation of friends. This place is busy, so either get there early or be prepared for a wait. The system for queuing is based on the size of your group, not first come, first served. So patience is required... While waiting, you are given a menu/order page, to select your meals. And you can watch the items being freshly prepared.Once inside, the meal order is collected and straight into it. We did experience some delays with items all coming out at different times - we expected this given this is the way food is served in Singapore, but items such as rice which are an accompaniment, you kind of want to eat with other items, not last. When the food did come, it was fresh and tasty. As soon as we were finished, the table was cleaned and we were all but kicked out! Next waiting please!!There are a number of these restaurants in Singapore, and we recommend visiting at least one on your travels
4
We went to this restaurant after being told about it. Apparently it's highly rated in Singapore and was awarded Michelin star! First impression- it's huge, maybe 70-80 tables! Crowded even on a weekday. As you enter, they give you a paper with something like MCQs (In an exam!). You tick off the dishes you want and move to your table. After a short while they they start delivering dim sums in wooden containers. This place is famous for dim sums. Along with that we had Chinese fried rice & noodles. All very well made & tasty. Fast, efficient service as well
4
We visited for lunch. Very busy and a long wait. Luckily one member had eaten here before and able to organise us by ordering and booking a table.Well worth the wait- tasty dumplings, spring rolls, rice and wantons all quickly disappeared. Unlimited jasmine tea appears by magic.
5
I’ve entered the restaurant casually expecting nothing special and it really surprised us, we had a dumplings based lunch with a local salad, buns and jasmine tea. The food was amazing, tasty and genuine, I especially appreciated the spinach in the vegetarian dumplings, they had a nice Mediterranean flavour and it made me feel home a bit. Definitely recommended.
4
The place is clean and the servers are very attentive. The food is fresh and very tasty. Loved the various selections from seafood, chicken and beef. The food is made right in front of you for everyone to see. They don’t go around in carts. Your menu items are served/delivered by various servers. Reservations recommended especially on nights and weekends.
5
DTF is THE best place to get dumplings! Their juicy pork dumplings are a must. Highly recommend the pork chop fried rice and the hot sour soup. The wontons in oriental sauce is a delight, so is the chilli stuffed with meat. This place is perfect for lunch on a rainy day
3
With more than 1/2 the tables empty with unclear plates, many customers have to wait 20 minutes before getting a table to sit down. This was what I experienced tonight at 6:05pm. Looking at the restaurant, only 2 waitress or servers plus the manager were at work. Basically a situation where there is insufficient workers on the ground. After about 10-15 mins, another staff came on and started to clean up the tables so that customers can sit down. I visit this outlet quite often and this is the usual scenario I witness on most time. Hence my advice is go to other outlets which I feel have better service and speed.
3
Food Is always consistently good like the rest of the outlets. Long queue and need to wait for a long time.
5
Dropped in while shopping for a quick snack. Excellent Dim Sum as ever. The pork & truffle Dim Sum was great.
5
Absolutely amazing dim sum. The flavours were delicious. Service good and reasonably fast. Not that cheap but well worth it. Recommended.
4
Nice place for Weekend lunch. Not crowded. About 80% filled. Food quality is great and service is great.
5
This outlet is comparatively empty during dinner time. Normal standard as other din tai feng. Xiao long bao, fried rice and sour spicy soup recommended.
4
We ate here around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. No wait for a table and it is mercifully in an air conditioned underground passage. Everything we ordered was great (chili crab bao, truffle pork dumplings, shrimp shu mai and noodles with sour cabbage) but I thought the menu was somewhat limited and not as expansive as some other dim sum restaurants
4
Was a bit hesitant to go to Din Tai fund being vegetarian, however ended up there as we didn't have another restaurant option after a long day. We enjoyed the veg dim sums, the noodles and the greens. Vegetarian options were limited, but good. Nothing tastes as good as their chili sauce mixed with the soy, guess thats Taiwanese speciality. Oh not to forget, expect a 30 min waiting minimum
4
Very popular .Took as much as 40 minutes to get a seating for the family ! Very clean ,good ambience ! One can get the menu while waiting and decide what you want have for your meal . Service was quick and efficient. One has to have a taste for Taiwanese food to appreciate the food here 
4
We love to come to Din Tai Fung. A great place to take people to enjoy the freshest dumplings, and some with a little twist. It is fun to see the dumplings being prepared through the glass as you wait for your table. It is a delight when you sit down and they arrive all steaming and so yummy. Worth a visit if you enjoy a good fresh Chinese experienc
5
Tried this branch after one in Taiwan. Let there be no confusion. DTF dim sum / dumplings are unbeatable. The specials are nice, however the classics are the one you go here for! Super soft and warm dumpling with very flavorful explosions on the inside. Must eat really
4
Would say this is the best Din Tai Fung in Singapore. Food is great! If you go at night there is a bit of a wait but it is worth it. Pricing is a little more expensive but given the location it is expected.
3
Had dinner there. Was expecting excellent food given the good reviews. Was disappointed by the xiao long bao. It seems something was missing. Could not fault the service as they attended to us promptly.
4
Great choice, great food great service outside USS. Went with friends instead of eating at USStudios and were very pleased with quality
4
The oriental salad has increased its prices to $5. 160grams said the staff. It is still good but pricing is getting a little high now. The Zha Jiang Mien has always been good but at $10.50, still it is a little pricey considering all the ingredients were beancurd, a few broad beans and minced meat sauce. The Kailans are $13.50. Way too pricey. Again, who would come here to eat vegetables. Overall, I have to say, food is tasty, but given its prices, we have no lack of Imperial Treasure to Crystal Jade to feast our bellies on Xiao Long Baos
4
Our first visit and once you understand the ordering process you will not be disappointed with the quality of the food and the efficient service provided. The menu choice is wide and varied whether you want a light snack or something more filling. The pork dumplings are wonderful
5
We had to wait around 30 minutes to get a table (no bookings for less than 8 people) but boy was it worth it. The best dumplings I have ever tasted - they literally melted in your mouth with an explosion of flavours. We ate plentifully and had the jasmine tea, all for a very reasonable price of $20. Very excited to hear they are opening a branch in London soon
3
There are a few branches of Din Tai Fung around Singapore and this one has become our go to branch for the weekend, because it is normally a bit less busy than the other branches. Do not normally need to queue or reserve.We find Din Tai Fung to have consistently good quality and some classic dishes from Taiwan (where the chain originated) like their braised beef noodle soup. Very reliable.On our last visit here, I think they were quite severely understaffed. There was a queue although not that many people in the restaurant and the food took quite a while to arrive. I hope they can get more staff
5
This restaurant is always busy. When we finally got a chance to try it we were with a Chinese friend so he knows a lot on the menu. He ordered shrimp and pork dimsum, braised beef soup, hainanese chicken, fried duck in wrappers, crab meat dimsum, fried rice and mango dessert. Everything was served hot. Every dish is cooked fresh and full of flavor. But since there is a big crowd inside expect the place to be a bit noisy. If you are choosing good conversation over good food this isn't the place for you. Tip: Book a reservation or come in early for dinner to avoid the crowd. It gets really crowded on weekends but it is the only restaurant open until 10 pm.
5
~Marina Bay Link Mall's DTF is exceptionally easy to walk in after 1.30pm on a Saturday, although still half full we managed land a table for 6 almost immediatelyother than mains for each of us we had an order of 1 each of every item on the appetizer menui kid you not DTF really knows their food & flavorseverything was as appetizing as we expected :
2
The food was delicious as always but the service was completely unaware of us wanting to submit our order, interested in clearing a huge stack of empty plates sitting on the table for 30+ minutes, or interested in any enjoyable experience what-so-ever. I've always loved visiting this chain, but this particular location I'll definitely avoid in the future.
4
Worked up an appetite at Garden by the Bay and loved the location....downstairs in the Mall out of the heat. Brilliant dumplings and rice dishes. Definitely recommended
4
This Taiwanese branch NEVER disappoints. It has consistent quality regardless which branch you visit in SIngapore . Throughout the ten years that I have eaten at Din Tai Fung, it is always the same satisfying experience.
4
As everyone has stated, the dumplings here are divine.It was crowded and we had to wait, even at 7:30 at night, they seem to be aware of this because they give a sheet to fill out to complete your order before you get to your seat. It hits the spot though, I would hit one of these locations before you leave Singapore
4
Though there's always a long queue for getting into the restaurant, the wait is worth it. The service is excellent, especially you are given the menu and order form before you actually enter the place. Thus, the food can be immediately served once you sit down. Authentic Shanghainese food, with a great variety to choose. This is definitely the place you won't miss out if you wanna try some tasty Chinese food
3
Whilst most people would approve of their xiao long bao, it does meet my expectation with the thick folds of skin & not so juicy/not melt in the mouth pork fillings. Imperial Treasure serves the best xiao long bao. I would recommend the pork chop fried rice (even more delicious paired with julienne ginger & vinegar), stir fry spinach (delicious, non oily & leaves a clean taste), hot & sour soup (ask for this to be served very hot, whets up an appetite)
5
There is a reason why every Din Tai Fung (Michelin star awarded) outlet in Singapore is perpetually busy, with long queues during the peak lunch and dinner times.This is one restaurant where one can get consistently delicious fresh food of the highest quality, and yet at decently low price points.Each outlet is with simple, but pleasing decor.I always enjoy their famous signature steamed pork dumplings (xiao long baos), with their trademark minimum 18 folds. It is also interesting to watch them hand-making these dumplings, individually.A perennial favourite of mine is their hearty fried pork chop with noodle soup. It can also come with fried rice. It pairs well with their chilli oil. Their appetiser Oriental salad is very tasty.Vegetarians can also try their vegetable dumplings as well as hot and sour soup, together with various vegetable dishes.Their hot Chinese tea is reasonably priced, and refillable.Service is extremely fast and efficient.Some of my colleagues actually call ahead for takeaways during dinner, when they stay late in the office. Hence, this is indeed a favourite restaurant of ours, which is highly recommended.HelenSingapor
4
We were invited by a local friend. We waited 30 minutes to get a table. It's most definitely worth the wait. The service was good not great but the food was excellent. Cannot miss the chicken dumplings or the stuffed chilies. Now that we tried the food we'd wait longer for a table. No alcohol and great value for the food you get
5
It’s true! Din Tai Fung really does taste better in Asia!!! I could eat heaps of xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for days. Perfectly made, these little soup dumplings are seriously a happy medley in my mouth. Depending on which location you go to, some may have an hour long wait (ahem Orchard Road). However, this location seemed a bit more remote (it’s in the basement of a corporate building), so we had no issues with the wait time. They were really on top of their service too! Attentive, but not overbearing. We ordered, and in no time, our food was out already. Great experience! Must eat at a Din Tai Fung while in Singapore! Any Din Tai Fung will do
5
Din Tai Fung is another best Chinese food restaurant in town. Whenever me and my husband go there, we always order spicy noodle bowl and drunken chicken. Their noodle are so great that they are soft and homemade taste.Another thing is chicken dumpling, very very nice must try dumpling. Soft, watery and fresh dumpling. The real Chinese taste like you might think yourself that you are in China
3
At this location, we went to eat on a Sunday afternoon. We went to the hostess stand and received a number that would be called along with a clipboard with the ordering menu common among all Din Tai Fung locations. We were expected to complete our ordering while waiting for our table to come available.When we were taken to our table, the waitress took our clipboard and the order was taken. though I was paying full serve prices on the menu in money. I was disappointed.The second disappointment was the sporadic delivery of the food items depending on when they were finished by the kitchen. They were spread out over more than ten minutes.This is not the quality of a one star restaurant, rather a fast food restaurant.The food was generally good but the enjoyment was diminished by the service.Nobody cared to ask if we were satisfied, wanted anything else, or how was the overall experience
5
we went to eat instant noodles there and the staff there were very kind .there was a water fountain there
5
Amazing dumplings, so light, so subtle. Prawn pancake was tremendous. The greens as well. What a fabulous experience!
5
Originally from Taiwan , the food at DTF is amazingly tasty always. If you want to have Dumplings and Hot&Sour soup head to this place. It is light on the wallet relative to other places in the Link Mall.
5
Went for lunch with a colleague when I was working in Singapore. This is a very popular lunch venue and with good reason! Famous for its pork dumplings which you can watch them make, as well as a whole variety of steamed buns and noodles.Stand out dishes for me were steamed bun stuffed with chilli crab, spicy pork noodles but most definitely the pork dumplings. I'd had other dim sum whilst in Singapore, but nothing like these. They were piping hot, full of flavour, yet so light and delicate. Definitely would return here, as there were so many other dishes I wanted to try. You have to make sure you get there early or else be prepared to queue
4
Yes u need to wait for at least 30 minutes as they don't take reservation . the place is always full as they serve simply amazing food. The kitchen is glass walled and so you can actually see the process of making dim sums. Very healthy, tasty and hygienic food. Definitely worth waiting.
3
We had a long day and wanted to have a delicious meal at the Marina Bay area. We were so hungry but we had to wait for almost an hour and the restaurant had no waiting area/chairs for the public. I'm not sure if it's the waiting, but apart from it as a treat to us, I find the food to be not so special, and their service just ok
4
My family of 2 adults and 2 kids ate dinner here in early September. We arrived at about 7 pm and was told there was a 40 min queue for a table. We were given an order form to complete whilst waiting. Even though this branch was in an underground link mall in the business district on a Sunday evening, it was packed!! The food was well prepared and seasoned. We enjoyed every dish we ordered. The Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) were a little disappointing, being small in size and with very little soup in them. The crab dumpling was particularly "fishy" in flavour. The pork dumplings we ordered (jiao zi) were delicious, tasty and juicy. The skin of the dumplings were just right, not too thick and doughy and held the contents well. The beef noodles were hearty and tasty. When we left, there were still many people queueing for tables! Good quality food, clean but fairly noisy environment, nothing posh. Queue, eat and go.
5
I've never had felt happy with food until I've tasted the delicious Xiao Lang Bao! It was heavenly and it made me feel so much happiness that I've wanted to eat more of it. I hope I'll be able to eat one of these soon back home.
5
We had an assortment of dim sum, fried won tons, fried egg rolls and shrimp fried rice. Everything was really good! They were quite busy when we arrived and warned that the food would take 30 minutes to come out, but we were eating after a wait of less than 10 minutes. Would return to this restaurant next time we're in Singapore, for sure. Our meal came out to about US$18 per person, which wasn't bad at all considering that this is Singapore and we were hungry
4
This DTF branch is near our SG office - connected via underground maze of stores, shops and restaurants. We made it a point to be here before 11:30am to be seated immediately. By that time, there's already a small line being formed.I enjoyed the selection of dumplings (shao long bao - as always), noodle dishes and steamed vegetables. Was treated by my colleagues so I xannot comment on the cost but I am aware it's a tad higher than other similar eatablishments. Well justified, if you ask me
4
The queue is generally longer than other branch and they're mostly tourists visiting MBS. Food is comparable to other branch so you probably better off visiting other branch. See their website for latest outlet lists, there seem to be new one popping up each year..
5
We came by recomendation, and we've to say that we ate the best dumplings ever. We had to wait a little, but before entring the restaurant tou have a screen which indicates the estimated waiting time.
5
Visited with the family, all the dumplings and buns were fantastic, highly recommend the pork variety. Finish off with the chocolate lava dumplings, big success.
3
Disappointing, food was nice but not as good as expected based on reviews, Dumplings average, overpriced for quality of food, beer was very expensive $12.50 for one beer.
Chain store franchise style of restaurant.
4
The Marina Bay Link Mall outlet of DTF is the only one we ever go to in Singapore. It is the only one where we manage to find a table in a timely manner. The food itself is sensational. All freshly made and served hot as they come out. The staff don't speak a lot of English but service is generally goo
4
We are regular cusotmers to a number of DTFs across Singapore and are never dissapointed. This is great cooking and is consistently served across the Island. We take friends and family alike and they are always very impressed. Fried rice with pork chop, pork and veg wantons and black sesame dumplings are delicious :
5
Really liked the Din Tai Fung in Singapore. In my personal opinion it might even taste better than the one I had in Taipei. You can safely judge a chinese restaurant's standard just from the fried rice it serves and their Pork Chop Fried Rice checks all the right boxes. Great egg to rice ratio, nice beads of rice that do not clump, fried pork chop with a light soy marinate and peppered finish. I always have this with a dip of vinegar. Dumplings are great here too. Served piping hot, the skin holds the meat broth so delicately and explodes flavor all in one bite. This restaurant serves food throughout the day from lunch till dinner. Visit during off peak period for quicker sitting time as all their outlets get packed really quickly
5
The little dumplings are made on site and you can watch it. Nice pork ones, nice crab ones. Good rice and veg too. Cheap and extremely popular restaurant. If you turn up for dinner or lunch you must arrive early or the queue is over 1 hour!!! Would go here again
4
I was here for dinner with a friend (who was just in Singapore for one night) and we loved the food. I would especially call out the chilli crab dumplings - surprising (but could have been spicier). We came early so had no issue with seating
5
We ate at the well-loved Din Tai Fung, Marina Bay location, because you can easily walk there from the Gardens by the Bay, which is where we were headed after dinner. Take your chances because you can’t make reservations and the place will most likely be packed. But the food is soooooo good! You won’t be disappointed
4
We were impressed by the huge selection of asian food in this restaurant. Waiting time to get a table was long but then the service was fast. All we had was very tasty.
4
We stopped in here for lunch today. We found there was a bit of a delay being seated but the staff were very courteous. The food was piping hot and quite tasty. All this and reasonably priced.
4
I was looking forward to going to this restaurant of the chain after a gap of 6 years and was happy with the food as well as their prompt service. I was quite happy with the vegetarian options and the food was appealing and tasty!
5
This clean bustling modern restaurant is always busy and deservedly so. Chefs working in full public view prepare exquisite dumplings, wonderfully spicy noodles and delicious chicken soup which looks pretty ghastly but tastes divine
5
Favorite Dumpling place of all time. Great quality food and fast service. The dumplings and the fried rice are a highlight!
4
Simply perfect for a (fairly) quick, high quality (very) and tasty (extremely) quick meal (this is dim sum people, NOT Shangai Tang at the Dorchester). We just NEED one - or many - of these in London, now...
4
The place serves one of the best dumplings around the city. A bit on the expensive side, the restaurant offers fares which can match the very best. Be ready to be greeted by a long queue but the fruit of this labour is tasty to say the least. The offerings are a bit limited for vegetarians but then it is not exactly a place for them
2
We went in the afternoon to give it a try. Food is not that great and what really lose my patience, is that after one of them take your orders, they just disappear. They didn't even check our table for the cutleries, plates and for whatever we need.We have to call for somebody to ask for this and that, and sometimes they just ignored us.Customer service is just so poor
5
The dimsums in Din Tai Fung are the finest & most tasteful in the island, most specially the Xiao Long Bao (make sure to compliment your dimsum with their signature vinegar & ginger)! This restaurant will never fail your craving Though the queues are always long, the wait is always worth it (shorter & faster queue in Marina Bay Link specially on weekends). All the food are served hot, fresh & well prepared, and this is consistent to all their branches in the island always a happy & satisfying experience in Din Tai Fung!
4
If you are looking for flavorful fragrant and variety of dimsums to eat this is the place (or other branches of Din Tai Fung). Other dishes are very well made too. I would highly recommend Garlic Nai Tai and Shrimp fried rice (2 of my favs) :). Though I must warn that the queue during meal times is long and so is the wait, so either hit the place well in advance or have patience. Good idea is to decide what all you would like to eat while you are waiting ! and also its a bit steep compared to other medium range options, but the food makes up for it
4
My first taste of real Asian food was very pleasing. The service was quick and the food tasty. My husband particularly enjoyed the steamed pork bun.
5
we visited three different places of this chain. Soup dumplings the best! Enjoyed all the other things we tried (except red paste/chocolate!). Just yummy. NOt super pricy but not cheap.
5
A great place to get some amazing dumplings. Pork, shrimp and chicken dumplings are spectacular delicious. Go for it, the spicy sauce noodles are great too.
4
We went on a Saturday and had to wait an hour to be seated but it was worth it! The mall it is in is huge and so we just walked around and people watched until our table was ready. Best dim sum around!!
3
The food is good but pricey, but you're in Marina Bay Sands so I suppose that's expected !! No smiles or customer service for that price tag either :( My tip: Head to Lau Pa Sat or even the food court at @313Somerset for some really good food at less than a quarter of the price you pay here....!
3
A kind of dim sum fast food. Its OK for a quick lunch but only if you have nothing around. Its not bad but definitly not my type of restaurant. Too bad because i love dim sum. Anyway much better than a Burger fastfood. And to be honest very disapointed. Was expected much better quality. For the price. OK Its not very expensive but still be if you consider that Its not very good
3
In general I love Din Tai Fung: it is the first place I go to when I am in the mood for dim sum. Last time I went with friends to the restaurant inside the Mall of the Marina Bay Sands and I was quite disappointed with the service: the staff was actually quite rude. The place is always very full and as the food is delicious I have the feeling that a good quality of service is not considered a priority...That is a pity!
5
Having been to Din Tai Fung in Sydney a number of times I was excited to see if the one in Singapore was just as good. And it was! You can't beat DTF's dumplings, they're absolutely delicious, always fresh and so carefully prepared. Whichever city you are in the world that is lucky enough to have a Din Tai Fung just make sure you go, you won't regret
4
Din Tai Fung is a cult place to eat in Singapore. Unless you book in advance you may have to stand in queue to get a seat. I was wondering if they would have any vegetarian options for me - the options were limited but whatever I ate was simply delicious. The Dim sums filled with fresh greens were delicious, so was their Mango based dessert
4
This is a popular chain restaurant specializing in dumplings as well as other Asian dishes. We had lunch there and you first place your order and then wait for a table. As it was a Saturday it was pretty busy so our wait was about 20 mins. It was worth it however. We were with 4 other people so we shared various dishes and it was a fun experience. There are several of these restaurants in Singapore and I would try any of them based on our experience at this one
5
Execllent,refined and quite quick and clean
One can see the cooks at work,never stop
Dim sum fantastic,a lot of customers especially at the weekend
4
What a lovely surprise when the little dumpling pops in your mouth and the warm soup fills you mouth, the taste is wonderful. Enjoyed all the food here, went back several times. Good service, fast and went back several times.
5
It's very clear why there is always a queue at DIn Tai Fung - the food is well priced, tasty and excellent quality. My favourite dim sum place in Singapore!
2
Again a chain not performing well in Singapore...how many times has this happened!I went early to avoid the rush & waited, waited waited for my very simple lunch order..6x classic Shanghai dumplings (w soup inside !) + steamed snow pea shoots.The dumplings finally arrived after a long wait (excellent as ever)--but the snow peas never came. Tea was served with my being asked --& I discovered later you must pay...it's a bit of a trick!I told the boss off & she said (as they always do in S'pore) "sorry"..I left disgusted.NO excuse
5
Soup dumplings are one of my favourite foods in the world and these guys excel at them! I also had the brisket in soup with noodles which was so flavoursome! If in town and you love soup dumplings, give this place a go - in the top 2 of the places we tried in Singapore
4
A lot of people awaiting to be seated - but its really worth it. The food is very fast served and even better tasting. We had a big dinner - with many different dishes and they all tasted superb. Its a must to try if you have the possibility. Been here 2 times and it will a third..
4
We are regulars at this DTF and have noticed that it's become increasingly busier over the last 2-3 years.The food is consistent, tasty and the kids enjoy it.It can get noisy and when busy the service can lag but they eventually get it right. You can ring ahead for dinner which helps with the queues
4
Finally tried one of these renowned din tai fung restaurant! The dishes were all delightfully yummy. The let down was its famous Siew long Lau (soupy dumplings). Unfortunately the skin was a little too thick and the filling was just a little too tasteless for my liking. Perhaps I am used to having the shanghai version? The other dishes were really good though. Service was swift and even though there was a line up at the entrance, it was very organised and the line diminished really quickly
4
I've been to DTF in other cities. This was my first time in Singapore.And it was much the same as I'm used to.The wait was not too painful - maybe 15 minutes or so.Had the pork and crab dumplings and they were as good as ever!Also had an appetizer called Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry. It was kind of a flattened eggroll. There was not as much duck flavor as I would have liked, but it wasn't bad.Also had a Steamed Chili Crab and Pork Bun. Again, it was pretty good but did not compare with the xiao long bao.Walked by another xiao long bao place today called Paradise Dynasty. I may have to try them next
4
I am not fond of dim sum restaurants generally. But I have been to Din Tai Fung twice (two different locations) and both times found it to be very good. The Hot and Sou soup was the best I ever had. The pork and vegetable steamed buns were tasty. And the tea was, not surprisingly, wonderful. I went there with two co-workers who are vegans, and they both came away very happy. Total bill was about $125 SD and we ordered too much
5
I love to eat Din Tai fung in Singapore because they sell pork intead of seafood and chickn. I usually order xia lung pao, cucumber pickle and ribs fried rice
5
If you are a dumpling lover, no need to explain why Din Tai Fung is an excellent place.
I particularly like the Marina Bay Link Mall branch during the week-end as not too crowded.
4
They serve quality fresh dim sum here. Everything that we ordered were very good. Will visit again when I get a chance.
5
We had the soup dumplings and they were REALLY good - highly recommend them - Great noodles and the service was Excellent!
5
Always love DTF and highly recommend any visitor to have a great feed at DTF.
Dumplings are to die for. Baby kailan is fabulous and love the lemongrass drink
Very efficient and great vibe
Will visit again
5
We asked the concierge for his recommendation for the best Dim Sum in Singapore. This was his recommendation and it was fantastic! A huge variety of excellent dishes. Go early at lunch. It fills up fast with locals.
4
You will see people waiting all day long. Avoid rush hour to enjoy nice Chinese food otherwise you have to wait more than 30 minute all the time. Or try other Din Tai Fung. For me, Din Tai Fung Korea was better than Maria bay on
3
We love Dim Sum but had never eaten in a Din Tai Fung due to the endless queues. Having walked into this branch by chance, we have to ask what is all the fuss about? Yes it is super Dim Sum ... but not worth queueing.for
4
offering excellent food quality with ingenuity with superb efficient service forget queuing a little for it rush hours it is worth it.All Singapore food outlets have gone down in quality service and values since they are primarily money oriented losing their sense with added sugar with 40 % Singapore diabetic from the disease of the rich..
4
DTF's steamed pork dumplings are to die for. They literally melt in the mouth. Super soft, juicy & very tasteful. They have a chilli dip for whose who would like a tad more spiciness. I've ate the prawn dumplings too but quite average. Since then I've sticked to ordering only the pork dumplings. Service is fast, but queue to enter the restaurant may be a bit too long, but DTF has an efficient queuing system.Apart from the dumplings, I found the other food like noodles & fried rice on the average side only
3
Average food at average price... Service is efficient ... Don't go during lunch time... Big office crowd. Their main branch in Taipei is much better, in terms of food.
5
Lovely dim sum restaurant , great choice and at a reasonable price . Staff service very good , ideal lunchtime venue . Been several times and always excellent .
4
Very fast, good food at a reasonable price. It was great to see the dim sum being made as they were ordered as well.

This is the third restaurant of this chain that I have gone to. This one was also great. The food is consistently good and the service efficient. I love the sesame bun. It is great as dessert. There was a special sizzling plate which was also great.
5
I've eaten in their Tapei restaurant so was interested to see if the same standards would be kept in this branch in Singapore.It is. Plate after plate of delicately flavoured buns, rice and other Dim Sum standards came in waves to our table. The service was fast and friendly although the place was absolutely rammed with lunch time customers. All washed down with tea.Its not cheap but then I find food in Singapore is expensive. It's definitely worth i

We first enjoyed Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, were it began. The original in Taipei is crowded and loud. This location is comparatively quiet with the same high quality dumplings. Just arrive at opening time and there will be no wait. Everything is good, but pace yourself. It is easy to order too much
4
What can I say but do put this eatery on the Must Visit list - if you have one. Reasonable pricing with superb food. I would give it a 4.5 if the rating scale had the option.My absolute favourites:Soup dumplings - pork ones the best.Hot and sour soup.Prawn pancake.Also try the tofu and mushrooms steamed in honey. Don't go by the looks, it is addictive. The lemongrass lemonade - perfect to cool the belly fired by the chilli sauce served

We visited Din Tai Fung on a weekday during the lunch-rush. There were a lot of people waiting, but they had a good system whereby you put your name down and received a number, then you waited and watched until your number was called out (in Mandarin) and/or appeared on the LED board. We ordered the XLB (Steamed Pork Dumplings, $8.50 for 6), Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry ($8.80), Noodle with Minced Pork in Bean Sauce ($10.50), and the Red Bean Chocolate Lava Steamed Dumplings. The service seemed good for most people, however they messed up our order and forgot to bring us all of our items except for the noodles. We had to wait about 35 minutes after we received our noodles for the rest of our items (excl. desert). This wasn't too bad as we had been walking around all day and were happy to sit in airconditioning anyway. The XLB were amazing, definately up there with the many other quality ones I have had around the world. The rest of the dishes were also of high quality and were very tasty. I would recommend also ordering the Fried Pork Chop on Rice as this seemed to be a very popular dish (we had tried before at a different location)
5
One more branch of Din Tai Fung and what is constant is the quality of the food and the waiting period. We had a 20 minutes wait during which time we ordered our food so that as soon as we occupied the seats, the food started appearing in clockwork precision. We had ordered fragrant pork with fresh garlic, green chillies stuffed with marinated minced meat, shrimp and pork wanton soup, steamed crab meat and pork dumpling, steamed chicken dumplings, fried rice with shrimps and eggs, stir fried spinach with garlic, stir fried Hong Kong kailan with special sauce, steamed chilli crab and pork buns, lemon grass juice and excellent Taiwan beer. The stuffed chillies, kailan, spinach and fried rice were superb. Words cant describe the heavenly taste of the dumpling. The service was superlative. They even got us a crib to put our shopping bags! One more Din Tai Fung branch conquered! Or was it the other way
5
Visited here for a evening meal as it was recommended by 3 people in Singapore. When I visited I had to wait 40min to be seated. However once seated the service was very efficient and the food was not only fresh but also very tasty. Surprisingly I expected it to cost a lot more. Would surely recommend anybody visiting Singapore who wants to try some fresh dim sum and it is great value for money. Will return for sure
5
Excellent restaurant near Marina Bay. Expect to queue especially during the week end. I think I had to wait around 25 min on a Saturday for lunch. I tried chicken dumplings and the fried rice with prawns. Everything was excellent!
5
The xialongbao (soup dumplings) here are amazing! ! The food is generally mild, tasty and reasonably priced.
5
The restaurant serves the best dim sums I have ever eaten. It is necessary to try all dim sum meals in the menu.
4
A good place to have a nice and fast lunch.
Service is efficient and the menu very tempting.
Fried and steamed dip sum were excellent, but beware some servings are huge and more than enough for two.
5
No frills, but amazing food, and fast service. Great selection and quality of food - will definitely be back the next time I'm in SG.
4
Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.. The place was jam packed and the serving staff looked a little stressed. But the food served really made up for everything else.. Excellent dumplings and fried rice... If you love eating dumplings this is the place you don't want to miss...
3
Good but a bit exagerated.... long queue not worth doing it. The crab ones are the only ones worth going for it. The show of the cookers in front is nice1, open kitchen. The dim sum are good but 6 pieces are very few... like an appetizer
5
The staff at this particular branch of DTF really do go out of their way to be efficient and friendly. I really enjoy coming to this one on a regular basis to have their dumplings and earl grey iced tea (it's delicious). Also recommend their Hot and Spicy soup, really nice accompaniment to your dinner of dumplings
5
Did not use TA, just walked through the Link Mall, saw this restaurant with open kitchen (behind glass) and decided to have lunch. Your choices from the menu have to be marked on a card, really easy. The restaurant looks more like a canteen but the food is super. The waiter who brings the food even has a mouthcap, it's very clean!
4
We found this restaurant on our last day in Singapore and it was a gem. We hadn't booked a table but we didn't have to wait too long for one. Think it was about 20/25 mins. They take your name, give you a number and a menu. When the table is ready the number above the door will flash and you can be quickly seated. There are a vast number of dishes to chose and something for everyone. Typical in style of these restaurants, there's no particular order to the food and it's brought out to the table when it's ready. We tried a number of dishes but a few stood out, for us the must tries are hot and sour soup, pork dumplings and the chicken wings. Green tea has free refills and tastes great. Service was great, with wait staff wondering around the tables should you need anything. There's always someone nearby to top up your green tea when needed. This restaurant is quiet noisy and busy, so not ideal for a quiet, romantic date, but the food, price and service make this a place that's worth visiting
5
Organised like clockwork and with no personal touch, but the dumplings are so amazingly good, I will definitely be going back! This is a 100% no frills canteen-feeling restaurant, but their pride and professionalism when it comes to the dumplings is second to none.
5
I love this place. Back for another visit this trip and just as good as always...a must when in Singapore! So fresh and clean...fabulous food. Kids loved it when chefs waved goodbye on the ways out...friend too!
4
Din Tai Fung has never fail me in terms of the service and the food quality. The xiao long bao and the fried rice is something that I will always order.
5
what should you say about Din Tai Fung else then: fantastic! local original food, served hot as it comes from the kitchen.
4
If you are in Singapore this place deserves to be in your TO DO list. It is truly one of the best restaurants in the city, and when you see chefs cooking it is simply hypnotizes you, in one word professionals. However be ready to queue at the entrance, that is a negative side of this popular place
1
If you want any kind of service, you better NOT look like Asians, and better show you have money!! We should have walked out, and forget about it, but it is my daughter's favorite place for dumplings, so we stay. I certainly gave them a piece of my mind of how horrible the service was. What else can they say except" I am sorry, we are short of staff", but everyone else was serviced, our tea was refill once, the waiter was never around, we couldn't even flag one down!!Terrible, terrible service
5
My family liked the meal at Din Tai Fung the last time I brought them here and asked me to bring them back again. This time, we visited a different outlet for our lunch. We ordered:- Stewed Beancurd Cubes with Honey Sauce: $4.80. This was cubed beancurd, black fungus stewed and served with peanuts. The beancurd cubes were sweet and nice. Not bad.- Steamed Pork Dumplings: $9.80. For 10 pieces. The skin is thin and it holds a nice gravy that gathered when the dumplings were steamed.- Fried Rice with Pork Chop: $10.80. The rice is nicely fried with egg and cut spring onions. Topped with a golden piece of fried pork chop. Lovely and tasty.- Dry Noodles Tossed in Special Sauce: $6.80. Hand-pulled noodles blanched and tossed with their blend of sesame and soy sauce. Simple and nice. They were happy with the meal and we left happy.Try it
5
We came here for dinner during the week. We had to wait a few minutes to get a table for two but you can already order your food while waiting. We got tea for free (which was not the case at another location of the chain). We ordered Dumplings and Buns as well as fried noodles. The food takes a while as it is fresh prepared for your order but is really delicious. The Dumplings are the best I ever had and the ingredients for the fried noodles were fresh. Service was friendly and efficient. We payed for two drinks (juice), 16 Dumplings, 3 Buns and the noodles approx 50$.
3
food is great! i visited singapore and my friends took me here. forgot the names of what we had since they ordered for me but we had some dumplings (soupy one and a couple of other variants), fried rice, and some chicken and seafood. portion is good, dumplings are good for sharing so we were able to sample 3 kinds. service is good, the food came out quickly and the servers were easy to deal with. im only rating it average though because the queue is ridiculous, they should be handing out numbers since they dont have seats/waiting area. it's also pricey (seriously for just dumplings and fried rice??) for a regular dinner meal. you should definitely try this at least once if you haven't yet, but there are other options for dimsum at a more reasonable price
4
The only bad point is the waiting queue at the desk. You register, make your selection on a given menu, and then you wait for your number to be called. Funny...Then the service is rather fast and good.Dumplings are great (we tried one with truffle and that was great!) and freshly made.Fried rice was fresh and tasty, the pork chop was okay.But on the whole it was a good experience for a fast and intesting/different lunch.I understand there are several of tehm in town, and it is a famous chain.It was worth it: 90 $ for two was a decent price for the quality and quantity we had.Enjoy
4
Really delicious fresh food. We visited two branches after such a good mean the first time. Pork and vegetable dumplings were delicious. I wish we had a chain restaurant of this quality and price in London!
4
I enjoyed the food, which was good value and had great flavors. I had a short queue outside before heading in as it was peak dinner time. The restaurant was busy but the service was very quick
5
This was ace but think you need someone that's local or familiar to guide you! Great food loads of it and great service and value one of my favourite meals during our stay!
1
We generally use TA to research our dining however, we had just arrived at Marina Bay Sands and were hungry after a long flight. Therefore we had no pre-conceptions about this restaurant other than it was very busy. That being the case, we thought it must be good. We ordered some dumplings, a pork and prawn wont tons and I had the beef soup. We found the food very bland and tasteless. I realise that this restaurant has had some rave reviews however, this just didn't row our boat. Tasted like typical food court food. Our best experience was eating with the locals on the street on a Friday night. BBQ's everywhere, jugs of beer and a very convivial environment. Sorry, I do digress! Take the time to get a cheap cab into the city for some authentic street food that is much more tasty, adventurous and all about soaking up the Singaporean environment and culture
4
Really like Din Tai Fung but have to admit it got more rushed and louder than last time we visited.The food is still great and tastes amazing but they didnt have their special dish anymore which they had advertised on several posters and on every tabel flyers....Service got worse, we were a bit left alone and had a hard time to get extra drinks, as no waiter came in our corner of the restaurant for quite sime time.Still a must go when in Singapore
5
The quality of food is of pretty high standard. We have tried different variations of soup dumplings (I liked a mix of pork & shrimp most of all), fried rice with shrimps & dessert. All was tasty though I should say that the prices are a bit too high for a chain restaurant. The service is quick. The location is great. Overall, great experience.
5
The queue here can be very long so you should make sure to arrive early before dinner or lunch time. Again you should try the Xiao Long Bao, which is very tasty. Noodles are about as good as you can get in Singapore. dishes are great too
5
Worked and lived in mainland china for 8+ years and I have had the pleasure to try various chinese cuisines from Sichuan, Shanghai, etc but Cantonese cuisine was always my pick. This place got some decent killer dim sum and that's what made me drop this review. Loved it.Always skeptical when it co.es to big chains and different standards all over but this one stands out indeed.Xie Xie ni
5
We have been to this restaurant before on a previous visit to Singapore, we have also been to the one in Taiwan so my husband and I are big fans. Very efficient and productive restaurant, if your looking for service don't be to judgmental, they take your order, deliver your food and that's it. The truffle dumplings are to die for my absolute favorite. There can be a bit of wait if you arrive in the peak of lunch or dinner time, but it does not take that long. We have learned not to have breakfast and arrive at 11 for brunch....enjoy we do
4
I have been to many Chinese restaurant around the world and this place has rise above the rest . It's good Chinese food from fried rice to dumpling you will not be disappointment with their food. It reasonable in price and best of all the portion is good for two to share . Thank you Din Tai Fung i truly enjoyed the food 
5
To say we ate a ton in Singapore is an understatement. There is delicious food everywhere, but Din Tai Fung takes the prize for the best. The dumplings are fabulous and the service is great! Definitely recommend and they have many locations.
3
location - mbfc
premise - as usual, big resto space and crowded
staff - chop-chop cold service
crowd - office crew
verdict - literally 'working crowd' Din Tai Fung
5
Been here many times ........ perfect dim sum and array of dishes. Seriously tasty food and always consistently high quality. You MUST go here if you're every in Singa.
5
This place was recommended to us by other travellers who visited Singapore before. And I can confirm everything that was stated before. The place is awesome. Famous dumplings are great, the cuisine is very delicious. My son was over the moon from their chicken and pork dumplings
5
Out of all the meals we had in Singapore, this was the very first place we chose (based on reviews) and it was also the stand out. (And it was the cheapest!). My son absolutely loved the noodles, buns and dumplings. Everything was fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong with your choices here. We had a great time here....nice atmosphere, lots of westerners and locals eating in and taking away and all in all very good food. It gets quote busy. Seek it out and wait for a table. It's worth it
5
Nothing more to say than if you love dumplings, you will love this place. These restaurants are dotted all around Singapore. Extra special funnily enough were the chilli's stuffed with mince meat and I was hard pressed to pick a favourite plate of dumplings - simply magnificent. Service was good and staff friendly
5
Amazing value, amazing concept. So clean, so delicious and the variety is amazing also. I could eat here every week and not get bored. It caters for everyone and while the dÃ©cor is a bit Spartan, the food really is good - better than good. If you love dumplings - and who wouldn't - this is a must. Seeing them made so expertly and actually seeing the good quality ingredients makes eating them all the more delicious. Not fine dining but the dining is more than fine
5
Such a great place to go for lunch, dinner or whenever you're hungry. We went to several Din Tai Fungs (always good to head there when you're shopping) and it never disappointed us. The food, Dim Sum, Salads, Wanton's, you name it, were consistent and very tasty and good. We had around 4 different dishes (as minimum) and we could only sit there and indulge. easy smooth service, nice tea and constant top-up of both tea and water. A MUST G
4
I have to say that I am addicted to this chain. I have now been to its restaurants in Singapore, Beijing and Los Angeles. I would recommend going either before lunch or around 1:30 because the lines can get long. The restaurant (Singapore) was spotless with a completely transparent kitchen where one could watch the line chefs working at top speed. Each dumpling is a work of art comprised of 18 (I believe) folds. Make sure to order the pork dumplings and the seaweed salad. This place is fun to try with a group as one can order and sample more dishes that way. Highly recommend for a quick, delicious lunch
4
Went there recently for a late Sunday lunch - (around 2pm) and we didn't have to queue.We ordered the usual pork xiaolongbao, egg fried rice with pork cutlet, plain noodles with chicken soup, stir fried dou miao, prawn pancake and hot sour soup.Service was quick - I guess it helped that we missed the crowds. I liked that the food was not overly salty and the egg fried rice was not oily, compared to the same dishes we had at one of the Taipei outlets. Prices are a little on the higher side but the meal was enjoyable and tasted good
4
Second visit was even better than the first. Pork Dim Sum was excellent. Pork Chop fried rice was very good. Service was average, but the check was excellent!
5
Good consistent quality- across the world! If you like Dim Sum you have to try here.
DTF us a special treat for all the family that isn't cheap- but good value given the quality.
3
Line was long but it was a given because it was on the weekend but it didnt taste the same as their other branches, staff we re impolite and rude towards other guest. Food wasnt hot nor luke warm but my favourite dish was still soso the spicy won ton ... btw it was pricy for dumplings
4
This is a great stop for lunch... yes, it's a chain (and we don't normally frequent chains much!) but it was recommended by a colleague and was well worth of the recommendation...Great lunch and some of the best dim sum I've had in Singapore :-
2
We had to wait 25mins to be seated and the waiter kept on hurrying us to decide on our order when we just sat down! He couldn't wait for us to finish our order and rushed off. Our order came and we expected better. The price we paid for the prawn dumplings did not meet the hype that everyone has been bragging about. I've had better dumplings in Melbourne for half the price! My 3 other friends weren't satisfied after the meal we end up going for Japanese sushi straight after
4
Love the dumplings served here - you can watch them being made with caring hands and its really a place that you have to pay visit to experience the vast amount of food available. There are a number of these places around Asia and I'm sure they are all equally as good
4
When walked by the restaurant it attracted us because it was packed, bright and you can watch food being prepared.We were quickly seated and provided a menu with a huge matrix of offerings. It was difficult to choose but with the help of waitress we managed. We had two different soups and two different dishes and rice. The orders came within about 10 minutes, fresh and hot, all tasty and plenty to eat. The only drawback was the big crowds, especially families with small children (not always best behaving) but that is the cost to pay in a popular restaurant with good food and service
5
We went to the Marina Sands location the previous night and then this one because it's a little closer to our hotel. We LOVE the soup dumplings!!!! We had them in Beijing and Hong Kong and couldn't wait to try here. They were wonderful (black truffle = best). It's in the basement level of a shopping mall with other places to eat, but we don't go for a view. I don't think we've been to one yet with a view of any kind, we just come for the amazing dumplings
4
Wanted to try some local food and picked this restaurant. It was full for dinner and we had to queue which I thought was a good sign of what was to come. You are able to see the chefs cooking and all wear face masks as well as serve the food with mask on - very re-assuring in terms of cleanliness. Food was lovely and service was great. Only complaint no wine only beer (but it might of byo - but not sure) nice and worth a visi
4
Din Tai Fung is a must eat place in Singapore if you like Dim Sum. Their food is great, service is quick and the food is consistent across all their outlets in Singapore. May be a bit expensive, but worth itLast evening I went with friends to DTF. We ordered prawn, chicken & pork dim sum, a clear soup and fried rice with pork. They serve chopped red chillies to which you add vinegar. The vinegar absorbs the zing from the chillies. Dip the dim sum in the vinegar and eat - make sure that you do not eat even a bit of the chilli - don't say I didn't warn you.A super meal with great friends
5
We love dining at DTF. Great selection of chinese dishes. Cant seem to get enough of their pork buns and dimsum.
5
The best Asian restaurant I have ever been. Great food, very fresh and hygienic. Busy sometimes with waiting times up to 30 minutes but it only shows how good it is so you even have to wait a bit.
4
The vegetarian dumpling and bun was superb. Everything was fresh. Shame they didn't have many other vegetarian options.
5
Came here twice for lunch during our stay, loved the pork dumplings, enough said! could have ate them everyday.
5
We enjoyed a delicious underground dinner down in the Link Bay Mall. We enjoyed the dumplings, soup and tried some new dishes for a change. The food and service was excellent.
5
If you like some dim dim sum this is the place to go ...WOW. The XLB is on par with the best I have ever had anywhere and I had XLB all over Shanghai. Lots of other choices and all extremely good at decent prices. At first glance it looks a little militant the way it is organized but once you have been there a while it focuses into a ballet of perfectly timed service and food quality with a taste that is honestly second to none. Hutc
5
This place has one of the most amazing chicken dumplings in the entire universe. I have been a big fan of dumplings and I just fell in love with the dumplings that they serve here. There have been few times when I will just have a box of 10 chicken dumplings with jasmine Tea and mango pudding. The dumplings are so soft with tender chicken and a little soup inside those little wonders and you just cant stop craving for more. The service is nice and the one of the best part to know is that they maintain a very good hygiene in the place. You can have a look at the kitchen where they prepare the dumplings and you will feel good to just watch them make these little dumplings. Enjoy
5
It's typical to queue for seating at this very busy restaurant but this gives one time to pore over the menu and select dinner items while watching the chefs hard at work behind their glass enclosed space. I've eaten here (as well at other DTF locations in SG) many times and am always glad I told my harping inner voice (What, you're eating here again, Lah?) to hush. The food is made to order and with high quality ingredients. I love the hot and sour soup, the pork dumplings, the kai lan and the vegetarian dumplings. The staff is well-trained and efficient and families are welcome. You can't go wrong dining here
4
The best thing about Din Tai Fung is they do quite well very simple dishes. The second best thing is reliability. You get the same quality, no matter where you go, in Singapore, Taiwan, HK, Sydney, or Southern California. Well-trained, efficient staff - a remarkable achievement in Singapore these days! No wonder even busy bees in the financial district are willing to wait up to an hour for lunch, even the private bankers with their HermÃ¨s bags. Not so much the male i-bankers, lest the xiao long bao juice stain their ties
4
Came across this place by chance but the food was very good. The menu was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure what to ordered and when to order it. Starters, mains, etc. However, everything that came was delicious and tasted like authentic Chinese cuisine, nothing like what I am used to being served back in England. A bit pricey, especially the beer, however I guess this is normal for Singapore. Well worth a visit
4
The most amazing selections and reasonably priced. We went in twice for lunch and the service was great as well for a place that is always busy.
5
great food , good prices.Very nice atmosphere and an amazing staff.Dumplings are their specialty with a nice variety.Hand made right in front of you, you can actually see the cooks make the dumplings from the start.Very clean establishment ,food presentation and service was excellent
2
A reputed name for dim sum, however this outlet on a Sunday where the crowd was minimal (well not over crowded and overflowing) the service was total almost nonexistent and the food quality was average as best. With a relative light crowd, it was unimaginable for the service to be so slow and the servers couldn't wait 'run away' with your order. It must be the very good business thus, there was no need to have more. A place to go if there is absolutely no where else to go
4
This was a restaurant that my family wanted to try for the famous Xiao Long Bao. Note that the place is always crowded and best time is in between lunch and dinner. We arrived at 330 or so and was seated after 5 minutes and waitied only 20 minutes for the Xiao Long Bao. In our last visit for lunch we were told that we have to wait 1 hour for our dimsum!!Other than the Xiao Long Bao the best dish was the mushroom noodles. Very firm and very tasty mushroom topping. All other dishes can be found in other restaurants. I found it a bit pricey as well.I will still say "you have to try
5
We have been coming to Din Tai Fung, weekly for more than two years now and always like going back to this branch. While it does not have some of the wider menu options of Marina Bay Sands, the quality of the food, its proximity to Marina Bay Financial Centre and the prompt, friendly service keeps us coming back, both to dine in and take away.We love the staff's friendly service, the new exploding chocolate lava dumplings and their new truffle dumplings!We are not fond of the long lunch queues (the sign of a great local restaurant) or the lack of variance of the menu. A popular place on the weekend for local families and parents with young children. Great food and service
5
I love the place i love the food which is in my top 5 of my favorite foods the dumplings are just amazing its incredibile how they make them their just so good i hope that i will return to Singapore one day again and Then i would Eat them all da
4
We dropped in here for a 'Dim Sum' lunch our forst day in Singapore when staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Quite crowded (with locals mostly which is always a good sign!) but we had good/quick service. A bit of a 'production line' restaurant but our Dim Sum was excellent & freshly made in sight of us, the asian salad was also delicious for a light lunch. Prices were reasonable for this area & indeed this was by far the best value for money meal we had anywhere in the Marina Bay area
3
Food was quite nice. But a bit on the high side. The prawn fried rice cost me $12.00! But xiao long bao was quite nice. The rest of the dishes seems to be quite normal and can be found anywhere in other restaurant.Not that great at all
4
One night in Singapore and met a group of friends here. The table was booked for seven people and eight turned up all at different times. The staff did not mind this and were accomodating. The food was delicious and I could have eaten the menu. We ordered many different items and each one was very good. Although a different cuisine, DTF reminded me slightly of the Southern Beauty restaurant chain in China. That's why it gets a 4 out of 5; it just is not quite as good as Southern Beauty. However, I would love either one in London
5
We loved the Marina Bay Link Mall branch of Din Tai Fung. It can be very busy, but the system works well and it's rare to wait too long. We didn't have a clue what to order so went for a selection of dumplings, a noodle dish, an asian salad and some delicious vegetables. Everything was tasty and fresh, I don't think you could go far wrong whatever you order. Prices are reasonable - especially if you go as a group and order a selection. Weird location for a restaurant (in a subterranean link mall) but very good food
4
I really can't tell the difference between din tai fung in different countries, whether it was the Sydney branch, Beijing one or this one, they are all great! This says a lot about their quality control! I wish they have one in London too!
3
as their big name, a franchaise arround asia.. this restaurant has their best service compare to other. I enjoyed the time being there with my couple and take the chicken with sake.. good job
5
Definitely the best dumplings I ever tried! Th truffle dumplings are just amazing ! Will definitely come back next time in Singapore
5
Fab find friend told me about it . Going back for my second visit very soon . Best food I have had in a long time and so clean . See you all soon
3
The trick is to get here awkward hours like very early or late lunch
/dinner. The speed and efficiency is good. the green veg and chicken and prown dim sum was awsome
4
The dumpling available at the chain are very interesting, The filling which is soupy is great idea & it helps to try out your chopsticks skills. Try picking up with the chopsticks without puncturing them & the satisfaction level goes that much higher.
1
Staff were disinterested and unhelpful. Food was very average with so called great dumplings actually watery and lacking taste. Food took a long time to arrive and came 10 mins apart. Suggest you avoid.
3
The food is predictable - as with all DTF franchises - so what often makes the difference is the professional service, the clockwork with which the food gets served, the politeness of the staff and that feeling that you're experiencing a piece of Taiwan hospitality exported. This branch disappoints on the service and professionalism aspects - staff are loitering near the service counters chatting, no one came to get our order until I literally waved the order chit around in surrender, empty tea cups not refilled despite reminder, serving staff delivering orders on the edge of the table expecting us to move things around ourselves. Even the guy at the counter who processed the bill looked really like he didn't want to be there. Not helpful, not friendly, not welcoming. Perhaps this branch thrives on the office crowd during lunchtime on weekdays so me being there on a Sunday afternoon, along with the other patrons at that time, were an inconvenience to the overworked staff. Definite morale issues
4
As expected, there was a long queue when we went to have dinner at this resto Saturday night. Despite this, the waiting time was quick and they already give you a paper where you can already note your orders.We still had to wait for our orders when we finally got to sit down. While in the queue, we were informed that the wait for the orders will be for 20 mins, but ours went past that. When we followed up, we were told of additional waiting time for 2 of our orders. In any case, when our orders started coming in, it got completed in a very short time. Was the food worth the wait? Yes. And their operations were very efficient
4
The concierge at my hotel recommended this restaurant to me as it was close to my hotel.I was slightly concerned when he said it was in the mall adjacent to the hotel.How wrong was I.The dim sum was amazing & very cheap. This just meany that my wife and I ordered a selection of dishes from the menu allowing us to sample a variety of delicacies.Personal favourite was the pork and vegetable buns. I are the complete serving and had to order another portion for my wife.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to sample dim sum
5
Pork Dumpling are the best !!! Must go,if you love dumpling.Please remember to book your place in advance to avoid waiting time for 30-40 mins!!! Different experience,loved it!!
4
Great atmosphere! Quick service and was great to see the team prep the dim sum.
Was really tasty and good presentation definable quality given a busy lunch time!
5
The food was fast, fresh and tasted fantastic. I highly recommend it as a first foray into SG cuisine...and for a very reasonable price!

This is a great place for dim sums ! but don't stop with that , there's more on the menu !The seer sour soup is heavenly , First time visitors : you need to wait at the entrance to be seated and if there is a queue , the concierge will give you an order sheet on which you can tick whatever you wish to order with quantity . A great time saver, cause then you can have a few minutes at the table before your meal arrives !!!!the bill is also presented at the table after all dishes are served , and you need to pay at the counter only . Take way is also kept at the counter ..plenty of Chinese tea served and that too without any hesitation!!!!Who drinks water when there is this great steaming hot tea !!Their other dishes worth trying are the green chill stuffed with pork (heavenly) the crispy cucumber is out of this world . The spinach with garlic is great, though I didn't much care for the drunken chicken . It was good but on that day my palate needed something spicy !! lunch and dinner times can get crowded with a longer wait .. noodles , plain rice also available , A limited choice for vegetarians and non pork/beef eaters .Buns with sweet bean paste are great but not for the diabetic . But then so satisfying and as the kids in the family say what an awesome meal !!!!A must visit if you love food !!! be careful last order is around 2130 hrs and dim sums are over a bit earlier !!

The dumplings are indeed all that they are cracked up to be! The soup dumplings melt in your mouth. We had a steamed bun with spicy crab and they were a big hit. Gyoza were tasty. There is a great deal of atmosphere and theatre in this place that adds to the experience. We had a ten minute wait but I'd queue for much longer if I had to!
5
A local friend took us to Din Tai Fung for an early lunch/brunch, and we absolutely loved it. The choice is amazing, and the dumplings are just devine. We were there right at 11am when they opened, and shortly after that it was full - always a good sign. Staff were friendly and service was normal (a bit slow, but not to an extent that it was annoying - after all it is all made to order).We can't wait to try the branch in Sydney when we'll go over next time! Or - of course - back in Singapore...Highly recommended
5
Truly great restaurant, we visited several times during our trip, and will definitely go back! The stuffed green chillies are great as an appetizer, as well as the oriental wontons with black vinegar and chilli oil. The deep friend pork chop is delicious. And of course, the steamed dumplings are great. The pork and pork/vegetable ones are definitely my favorites
4
The food is just delicious. Me and a friend ordered a few dishes, besides the title one. Some noodles, also the fried rice with pork chops.Whatever you choose, you cannot go wrong. They offer free tea, but I also tried a korean beer they have. Great choice
5
Din Tai Fung is a must! We went early when they opened at 11.00am so there was no waiting, otherwise you can be in the queue for over an hour. The wait is worth it, aside from the delicately flavoured pork dumplings, the crispy duck rolls were also a delight. Staff are lovely, ordering easy and prices very reasonable. You won't be disappointed
5
Service is fast, nearly never any queue, food is great, and the price is mild too. Love their dumplings and chicken stock soup with wantons. Once we had dinner there for 3 hours and the staff was still friendly and made sure our free flow tea cup was always full
4
Ate at a Hong Kong restaurant and gave then 5 stars. The food here is as nice as in Hong Kong but the service is not.
Staff are rushed of their feet here and not as courteous. Therefore only 4 stars.
5
Have been dining here so often and now finally want to phrase the feedback
The dumplings here are awesome
Cooked in the most hygienic manner, the staff attititude is prompt and we'll balance service
A must try if u around the place
5
Visited here at marina bay sands. This is quality food served very well and hygiene is very good. Loved it . Was recomended by a friend and it was great
4
very nice vegetarian momos...good food quality and nice service...service is also very quick....should have more vegetarian options ....
4
This spot is a favorite for DimSum lovers. Though not as good as Hong Kong's (by a small margin), the DimSum here is just as delectable and comforting. The Steamed Shrimp Dumplings and The Pork Buns are my favorites. Expect a line so come in early
3
I dined here on my own, without my husband and it makes me wonder whether that was the reason why I didn't get a good service. Right from the time I asked for a table for myself I got the feeling that I should not even be there! I ordered from the Dim Sum sheet - nothing spectacular or fancy, just fried rice with the pork cutlets. I waited 40 minutes for my food! There was a European woman who came in almost 25 minutes after I did and she got her food before I did. When I started to look at my watch - that was the only time the waiter approached me and said that he was going to check on my order. While I agree the food here is okay (I wouldn't exactly rave about it), the service isn't great. Or maybe, I should say that the service to Europeans, the Chinese and Japanese are good; but forget it if you are not any of these races. I certainly would not come back again
5
We found this place on another community suggestions site and since we are huge Dim Sum addicts, we though we give it a try. The food was amazing! We had tons of Dim Sum and some other specialties like the Oriental Salad and vegetables. All of the dishes were great and tasted awesome! Great place to be for lunch, since the athmosphere is very mall-like. I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic dinner
4
Went there few times when visiting Singapore this year. The whole family enjoyed the food... Meat was tender and crisp... Steamed dumplings are highly recommended.. There is a show kitchen at the entrance. It's not the place for a nice, romantic dinner... But great for quick lunch/ dinner with the family
5
I used to live in Singapore for 4 years and i visited this restaurant almost every week. Their dumplings are just phenomenal. You go to this restaurant mostly for the dumplings, they also have other dishes of course, but you will end up eating only one kind of food because they taste sooo good. Avoid Lunch Time as the place is very packed, unless you go there not later than 11:30. Eat the pork dumplings !!! If you have one day in Singapore, consider eating here :-)
4
Din Tai Fung had been on my radar since about 6 months now. So this time when me and my friends finally made up a plan to visit, I wanted to make sure we execute.Getting a table (5/10)This is quite a task at any of the outlets, esp this one at marina bay mall. On a sunday at 8.30pm, we had to wait for around 25 mins to get a table. However the staff is quite systematic and give you tokens.Service (7/10)Service is brisk and fast. They will not bother to give you any warmth or smiles, just their products.Food (9/10)They had the best pork dumplings i have ever had in my life. Dumplings are juicy and just melt in your mouth. We also tried the chicken soup, chicken wantons and the carrot - celery - pineapple juice. Everything was top notch ! Make sure you only try the recommended dishes that are marked separately in the paper menu handed out while you are waiting for a table !Hygiene (5/10)It is human mentality to find any restaurant with an open kitchen to be more hygienic. But when we were waiting for food we saw all sorts of unhygienic things inside the kitchen - including chefs tasting directly from ladles and putting them back in the cooking containers; we also saw dumplings being rolled by bare hands and the same hands being touched to other body parts.Overall I would def visit again, just for the dumplings
5
Love the authentic dumplings and dim sum at Dim Sum. This is a must visit when I visit Singapore. Highly Recommended and Unbeatable Value.
2
I loved the dim sum and I ate quite a lot honestly. But that's all. The rest are just ordinary. I'd rather takeaway dim sum and something special elsewhere.
2
We just ate here last week and Dumplings were great I really loved it and Good ambiance but nothing more special.
5
The Xiao Long Bao dumplings are really excellent. There are other dumplings that excellent too. Make a great meal with just dumplings (and some Taiwan Beer). This restaurant was the clean, efficient restaurant producing tasty dumplings that I find at all the other sites
5
My wife and I ate at this restaurant during a recent trip to Singapore. The food is fantastic and the prices are reasonable. We'll be sure to return the next time we're in Singapore.
4
I ordered fried rice and steamed Pork Dumplings. Both were good.
There are many Chinese restaurant in Singapore, however, I think anybody never been disappointed. If you can’t speak English and Chinese, you can order any food with checking on ordering sheet.
5
The wait was a bit long and the woman who mans the hostess stand is gruff, but the affordable, yummy dumplings make up for all that. Liked it so much that I went back a second night and took 11 other people with me.
4
Xia Long Bao are just great. Actually all the dumplings are amazing. You do not usually wait long and they have plenty of staff to attend the tables. Though you still need to waive sometimes...
5
I ate at the raffles location this time---but the are all essentially the same country by country. I've noted the mixed reviews and must disagree: the food that they offer is excellent. Nothing fancy but absolutely consistent. Further, it impossible to find a cleaner kitchen and staff in Asia. These guys do it right.
5
We had a lavish treat of dim sum in Din Tai Fung. There's a good range of dishes to choose, although probably not too much if you're vegetarian. I don't usually like fried dim sum but the batter was always kept tasty and light! I especially recommend the roast pork, char siu and stemed dim sum. The decor and setting is a combination of a modern and traditional Chinese style and is certainly something different from other restaurants. Despite being quite busy, the staff remained attentive and very pleasant throughout our meal. Certainly not a cheap meal at $50++ per person, but is definitely worth it for a special occasion
4
A great restaurant with efficient service. Everything was well organised and the food was served quick. Dumplings and the cold chicken dish were wonderful and do try out the interesting roselle flower drink. Will definitely be back soon.
5
A great place with quick and efficent staffs.
Love their chilli and best time to visit is on a Sat/ Sunday when the office crowd is out.
4
I've been to this restaurant before. It's really good for the dumplings, as you would expect from a famous chain. The dumplings are great, but the atmosphere is fairly standard.
4
I first tried this Chinese outlet in Taiwan and it was fantastic. They even had a Michelin star over there. The standards in Singapore is comparable and the dumplings are as good. Besides the usual pork dumplings, you should give the red bean ones a shot
3
This place serves the beat dumplings in Singapore. Period.I have also tried fried rice and spinach (steamed) in garlic sauce and have not been disappointed. The only bad part is waiting often for 30-45mins-60mins to find a table. My suggestion is to go 45 mins in advance, take a queue number and then go shopping and come back later.But never......ever.....miss dumplings here if you are around. It would be an insult to this great place
4
I go to this place about once per week. There are good choices but I recommend sticking to the dumplings as I do - that is the specialty and it is clear why. service is not fantastic but overall, the food is good enough to cover for that. Go if you haven't been
4
We (2 adults, 2 kids) got here nice and early on our visit to MBS so didn't have to wait for a table or our food at all. The ordering sheet came as a surprise as we are used to the carts doing the rounds in Sydney's Haymarket yum cha restaurants. We enjoyed the selection very much, although there were a few things we probably wouldn't order again. The service was great and we enjoyed watching the dumpling makers ply their trade - unfortunately (or maybe not) Tom C had already been well before we got there :)
5
It all looks a bit strange when you get here!! You pick up a menu card and a number. You chose what you want of the menu and when your number comes up you are made welcome. The food takes a few minutes to appear. But it is delicious. Dumplings are to die for!! Every month they have a special dumpling on offer
4
I had lunch here with colleagues, who are local to this area and had raved a lot about this restaurant - It didn't disappoint. We waited quite a bit before we were given a table, though the queue wasn't too long (Avoid usual lunch time if you can)As we had ordered while waiting, it didn't take too long for the dishes to arrive. Hands down, best dumplings and fried rice I have ever eaten.Comfortable sitting area with enough roon between tables and it wasn't a noisy place.Very efficient service. The staff were quick to respond when needed.Highly recommended.A
5
Wow ! for people who love to experiment are adventurous - and prefer quality over quantity ! this is mouthwateringly good ! the prawn fried rice , the pork dumplings , accompany with steamed stir fry greens and the chilli sauce -simply sublime ! by the way Tom Cruise is part of their claim to fame ! but seriously good food 
3
Pork chop is great, but the fried rice is not as good as the one at tampines or nex, the peppery taste lacking.
Tried the wanton in chilli sauce, it quite nice
3
I like this restaurant. They have nice food and reasonable price. Service is very good too except the one at Suntec building.
5
I have eaten in a few Din Tai Fung's and this one in Marina Bay mall is another great one. The food is great and the service was terrific. I recommend the spicy shrimp dumplings and the pork chop soup.
5
In a city of great food this one really stands out as a delicious dim sum restaurant. Top of its filed in food and service. The dumplings are to die for and the green tea that is constantly topped up was delightful.
4
My friends and I love settling our dinner here! Yummy egg fried rice and xiaolongbao! They freeze the lemon tea into ice balls and served them along with my cup of lemon tea! I think it's a nice idea, and I no longer have to be worried drinking diluted lemon tea!
5
we had been recomended this place so went for lunch. there were 5 of us and we ordered so much food there was leftovers. the quality was amazing and you can watch the chefs prepare while waiting in queue. please note the following. 1) you order before entering so check the board closely. 2) order 2 portions of the stuffed chillies - not too hot but amazing 3) if you get a number the wait is not too lon
3
This is one of a chain across Singapore. It is obviously very popular - I had a long wait to get in though I was there for a late lunch and eating on my own.I started with the hot and sour soup which was OK - though hard to find any meat in itThe dim sum which I chose were good but not really special - I have had a lot better in London and New Yor
5
I just completed a very positive review of One Dim Sum at Prince Edward in Hong Kong, and I thought that while we are on the subject of dumplings and buns, Din Tai Fung at Marina Bay in Singapore really deserves a mention.This is part of a chain, and sits in the very glitzy Marina Bay Sands mall, alongside the likes of Cartier, Gucci, Chopard and Louis Vuitton. The good news, however, is that this is a big, noisy dim sum restaurant, with the punters stuffed in elbow to elbow, yelling at each other to be heard, and the food is simply sublime . . .There's not much more to say about it really. Din Tai Fung is not expensive, you might have to wait for a table, and the service staff are run off their feet . . . but these people take dim sum to another level entirely
5
High-End Dim Sum Type Dishes. Very Delicious. Specializes in Dumplings, plain, as many filled with a variety of items. One can have filling with meat, seafood, or vegetables. Despite being a chain restaurant, all items are made fresh onsite by a team of very busy chefs. Even better, they take credit cards, unlike many of the taxis in the area
4
First restaurant that I visited in Singapore. Feels like a "McDonalds" type of restaurant with a lot of people and you check off what you want on a piece of paper before you are shown to a table. On the positive side the food was great, and service good. I would recommend
5
Great food, great price, and generally prompt service (they want your table back promptly!). Whats not to like. Recommend going a bit early or late to miss the lunch crowds.
4
what a great luncheon place, - there is a saying, if the queue is long the food is good and whether it's the city link restaurant or Paragon, you will enjoy the dumplings - they are so fresh and so light it's like eating air! Good value for money, not too rushed Dim Sum service, time to eat a couple of dishes together before the next arrives, try for appetisers Fragrant Pork with garlic, of Shanghainese Drunken chicken, but leave room for the 6 or 10 portion dumplings, steamed pork, steamed shrimp and pork, the absolute best, steamed crab and pork and then we can talk about the rice, yum, fried with shredded pork and egg,,,,,,,amazing
5
Coming from San Francisco, I have had what I thought was very good dim sum over the years. Din Tai Fung is in an entirely different realm. We had many good meals in Singapore but our last day lunch at the very popular BTF was a highlight
5
Best DIM SUMS I ever had. It is a crowed place but everybody is welcome also waiting for a table doesn't take long.The pork, the veggie and shrimp are delicious, the noodle soups are worth a try and the pork cantonese style. Just enjoy the crowds, feel like a local and have a blast eating soup with chop sticks.Hope this chain will conquer the european world also...
5
If you love dim sum, you will be in heaven at this place. The food is prepared behind glass walls and immediately served, the wait staff RAN to each table with steaming orders, the variety was large, and flavors were perfect. Only problem is that we were there on a holiday Saturday (Chinese New Year), and we have about a 40 minute wait. It was worth it though. We loved this restaurant so much, that we ate at its sister location in Hong Kong
5
We met up with friends in Singapore on our way to Australia and had supper at this chain. We had seen the queues of local people waiting to eat there earlier in the day and decided to try. It was superb food freshly prepared absolutely delicious . The added bonus (for Singapore ) was the reasonable price . Excellent we would recommend it highly. Gary and Jenny Cheshire, Tony and Barbara Redma
5
Was walking til we all got really tired but not hungry. Couldn't find a place to sit and since there was no Q, we thought hey why not!! It was as usual, excellent dumpling. One can see how they make it. Very fast service as it was not busy.Liked the mango pudding after our meal
3
Ate here with my wife for lunch and basically the restaurant was far too busy. The dim sum on offer was pleasant enough but the "conveyor belt" of people trying to get served and the speed at which they try to make the tables clear, puts pressure on the diners. Not a brilliant experience regrettably!
3
On our last trip to Singapore we ate at Din Tai Fung at least three or four times. We fully intended to do so again but the quality of the place has plummeted. In short:- we arrived at 3pm thinking we'd be between the lunch and dinner crowd but were still told it would be a forty minute wait.- however at least HALF of the tables were empty and there was a sizeable crowd waiting in the middle of the mall with no seating on offer - when we finally did get in we were told it would be another thirty minutes before we got any food, forty five minutes later it arrived. Even drinks took twenty plus minutes to arrive.I'm not sure why they were so short staffed, it was the Monday after CNY and there was clearly a demand for this restaurant.The only reason I've given it an average is the dumplings are amazing, otherwise this would have been a terrible experience
5
We have been there a number of times on visits to Singapore. It is a bright and bouncy place with great noodles, pork buns and a great range of soups. If you want somewhere that gives quick service and a good menu then this is the place. If you have young children they will be made welcome. The service was very prompt and quickly served after ordering
5
If you are in Singapore you must have atleast 1 meal in one of their restaurants..........................never miss out, great service and greater
food
4
We enjoyed all our food, which was good value and had great flavors. We had a short queue outside before heading in as it was peak dinner time. The restaurant was busy but the service was very quick. The only improvement I would say the staff need to smile a bit more... the wait staff seemed a bit sad
2
I had heard so much about this place and couldn't wait to go. My partner and I were in the mall yesterday and when we passed by there was such a long line of people waiting to enter that we decided to be the first ones there the next day. So today we arrived 10 minutes early and there were only 2 other parties ahead of us so we were happy. Unfortunately that happiness turned to disappointment after the first bite of my pork bun. It was so flavorless. It was only the first of many disappointments of our lunch. Every thing we ordered was bland, unseasoned and tasteless. Perhaps we're spoiled from living in San Francisco for 20 years and having had many wonderful Dim Sum.The only saving grace was being able to see how the dumplings were made
5
I love Din Tai Fung and my favourite one is in Taipei but this one comes close! It was just before 11am when we arrived (I know, early lunch!) but there was no queue which is a great bonus. The duck in onion pastry was excellent! The dumplings fantastic as always, as well as the noodle soup. The food is just so good...
5
Just awesome. We aren't trendy types but this one we actually were sitting drinking beer and chewing before we realized it had serious TV personality and rating... ya.. we dug it...craved it.. went a lot. . Now we just dream about it... The staff is actually as cool and as masterfully executed as the food.. worth noting.. In typical Asian manner the place is a top... perfect no PERFECT in all regards.. much love from u
4
Din Tai Fung has branches all over Singapore. They specialise in Dim Sum and small plates of food.The Oriental Shanghainese Drunken Chicken and the Green Chillies Stuffed with Marinated Minced Meat were both very nice as we're their Dim Sum.A couple of dishes I noticed on the menu look like they should be nice and worth trying next time. Braised Sichuan Sliced Beef and the Fragrant Pork with Crushed Garlic
4
The food here was so good. My friend and I went on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. We tried four dumplings and 1 bun and the egg fried rice. Everything was exceptional. The service was quick and the food came out promptly. The only bad thing I would say is go with the noodles instead of the rice
5
Food quality : amazingWe visited the marina bay sands joint .They are a really busy restaurant and a no frills place .The egg fried rice is delicious soft and oh so melts in your mouth and they have good vegetarian options too.I are up 10 of their veg dumplings they were so good .For meat lovers they have plenty of options too.During lunch peak hours expect a waiting period of 20 minutes but ample shops around so the wait won't be too much ..Amazing food and great freshness to the place !!
4
We went on a Friday night relatively early (about 6:30) and the wait time was only about 10 mins but by the time we left the line was very long. While you are waiting you can look at the menu and prefill your order sheet. We ordered a variety of dumplings and buns (4 types of dumplings and 2 buns for 2 adults) and found the flavours of all them to be good. For this plus additional pork cutlet dish, 2 beers and apple juice was just over $S80, which we thought was pretty reasonable, especially given that the drinks were close to $S25.The setting isn't that great, rather like a fast food restaurant but I guess this is kind of what it is! Overall we enjoyed the meal and would return for a quality, quick dumpling dinner
5
Our experience at Din Tai Fung was pretty faultless. We knew it was extremely popular, and arrived soon after the restaurant had opened for the day. By the time we were leaving, the entire place was full. After perusing the menu we completed the order form, indicating which dishes we would like. The waiter confirmed each dish, which was then crossed off as it was delivered to our table. The steamed dumplings were delicious mouthfuls of meaty, soupy, doughy delight. The steamed buns were also a highlight. The only dish which disappointed somewhat was the sliced duck in crispy spring onion pastry, which lacked flavour. Although food hygiene is important to us, we were a little taken-aback by the appearance of those preparing the food at Din Tai Fung - dressed head-to-toe in white and wearing surgical masks, they seemed more suited to an operating theatre than a restaurant. This added to the unique experience, and we won't forget our first Din Tai Fung experience
5
I go there regularly. I just love it. You may have to wait a bit but it worth it.
Go and try dumplings and buns :)
A must try for Asian taste !!!
4
I've always been a fan of their 小龙包 (xiao long bao) and it has reigned no.1 on my list.Was around the area and craved for some quality-worthy dumplings and decided to try out this outlet. Ordered 1x Meat Bao and 10x Xiao Long Bao. The Meat Bao had just the right amount of bun with generous servings of piping-hot-flavourful-meat inside. The Xiao Long Bao, however, has seen better days. Still top-notch as ever, but the servings shrank! The Bao looked distinctively smaller, with less meat and even lesser soup! Goodness!Not sure if the chef had an off day but would definitely give them another chance! =) Afterall, this is Din Tai Fung we're talking about.I would give it four stars for the nice ambiance, no waiting time (during lunch time) and quick service.Observation: There seemed to be lots of Caucasian tourists at this outlet, perhaps due to the nearby hotels.Tip: This outlet is recommended as it wasn't so crowded as others during lunch time at 130pm on a Saturday. No waiting time needed
4
Well, I probably have eaten here countless times and DtF remains one of the best value for money Chinese restaurants ard.Famed for its xiao long pao - or steamed dumplings. They quality ingredients used it's obvious even for it's steamed rice served. Go and try all the various food but the various dumplings and fried egg rice remains my favorite and comfort food.Standard and quality is similar to its Taiwan branches
5
I was visiting our local office at Marina Bay Financial Center when my colleagues asked what my preference was for lunch. After a short walk to the mall, my light lunch suggestion was replaced by a visit to Din Tai Fung. A wonderful meal that was definitely not light. The dumplings were spectacular. The ordering was very easy and the server helped with suggestions and portions. You can order 6, 12, 18 dumplings so we mixed and matched. Throw in a couple of veggie dishes and you can spend all day powering down dumplings and tea. Din Tai Fung is a great place for lunch but I would also make the trip for dinner as well
3
as din tai fung has expanded to many locations, the food and service seems to have suffered. I have dined at Hong Kong, and shanghai locations as well. their rapid expansion seems to have caused both quality and service to suffer. the food is still good, but there are many better options.
5
A lunch in Din Tai Fung is flawless. I can't forget the taste of pork dumpling. Dim sum is also very good. The service is good though crowded. The price is reasonable. I had to come twice during my trip. Highly recommended! Can't wait another visit
4
The place is almost crowded but of a sufficient service. Good price for tasty Chinese cuisine. Pork dumpling is totally excellent. Dim sun is far of the best. A little mess there but when I try first pieces of dishes, I just forget everything but amazing taste of food. Great foo
4
Had to queue for 25 minutes on a Sunday just to be able to eat in this restaurant. We ordered almost everything because we were so hungry from the long wait. The truffle xiao long bao stood out for me, very delicious.. The sliced meat were also excellent. We also ordered the beef noodle, oh, the beef were very tendered! The vegetable dumpling were also okay and their signature xiao long bao were what you expect to taste. The spicy cucumber is also the best for me. We also ordered the pork chop, also good. Ambiance is good because you see all those making the dumplings and the area is big and full packed. Service is slow though because of so many people to attend too
4
I'm not normally a fast food fan, but locals had told me that most Singaporeans eat out more than they cook, as food is so reasonably priced at either hawker food stalls or food markets in the malls. So to check this out we ate here one evening during our stay - the place was packed with Singaporeans enjoying an after work supper. Apart from the noise levels, which are high, the food (which you tick off on a list provided by the waitress when you arrive) comes quickly and is very tasty. We chose 3 sorts of dumplings, 2 dishes of greens and some noodles, all would be worth having again. They were served with free tea which was topped up often.To pay, just take the bill to one of the tills - no waiting around for a waitress - quick easy and cheap!I'm not sure it's converted me to a fast food fan, but I can see the attraction
5
A Michelin star restaurant specializing in a Northern Chinese dim sum called xiao long bao. In my opinion, these steamed dumplings need to have a thin & strong skin that won’t break when picked up; the pork fillings must have a distinctive balanced flavor; and of course a spoonful of soup. We had the crab, chicken & traditional pork dumplings (as well as other dishes) and the pork dumplings fully lived up to all expectations of a perfect xiao long bao. They have multiple branches with prices adjusted for its location (certain branches charge more for the same thing). This is must for a Singapore visitor
4
After visitting allot in singapore this look alike fast food restaurant was really good and tasty. The price was ok. Mostly recommended.
5
Whenever I'm in Singapore this is a must visit place for the perfect steamed pork dumplings. I cannot recommend highly enough for high quality food at an inexpensive price. Can we have one in London please!
5
Great restaurant the keeps in line with the quality experienced in Taiwan or in the US. I was pleasantly surprised and the waiters were very friendly. Good price for good value and food.
5
Ate here one night as we have eaten at other Din Tai Fung's in other countries and had a good meal. This was no different great food, attentive staff and good value. The house famous dumplings again didn't disappoint and were very tasty. Would go back
5
Stopped here for lunch while browsing through the mall. Service is friendly and efficient. Had the chef's recommended Special Braised Beef Noodle Soup with Beef Brisket (delicious - can see why the chef recommends!!) along with steamed dumplings and steamed buns. Homemade noodles. Prices very reasonable. Good for a casual lunch or dinner for anyone. Would highly recommend! Also can watch the chefs make the dumplings and buns
1
Dont waste your time - truth is Din Tai Feng is good only in Taiwan (where it originated). In Singapore, it simply sucked. You are better off with Paradise Group or Crystal Jade Group.I worked in the offices above Marina Bay Link Mall and I rather grab a sandwich from a convenince store than eat Din Tai Feng. Only thing good is the Pork Chop Fried Rice. The rest is just mediocre when compared to Paradise or Crystal Jade. Remains a great tourist attraction because of its awards...but Singapore is not the place you want to try Din Tai Feng
5
This is one of the many restaurants in this chain but they are great value and a great meal. Classic HK style soups and dumplings. Can also get noodles and buns but if you want to taste great chinese food and dont want to be over adventurous then this is a very safe and low cost experience
5
We were recommended by some of my colleagues about this place. So we chose this place for dim sum before we left Singapore.I was regretful that I did not come here early.The steamed pork dumplings was delicious beyond my expectation. The service was good with attentive and friendly staff.It was affordable for me.I will be back this place when I am in Sing
5
service is quick and the food is always the same high quality. i been here over a dozen times and ntg ever disappoints. you always get the quality food that you are looking for. specifially, i can recommend to try the fried rice with pork chop. enjoy
4
My friend insisted me to come to this restaurant. At first, I didn't really into this theme of food, but after taking the 1st bite of the dumplings, I know I would never regret coming here. The queuing line was amazingly long. It took us more than 20 mins, but anyhow, worth it.Just one thing is that the place is a little too noisy for me. I hear that they have Din Tai Fung around Asia, canâ€™t wait to try others restaurant

If you need a great meal, at a great price. It would be impossible to go wrong! Staff is on point and the food is served fast and delicious! Don't be afraid to order more after the initial meal!
2
Went to two of them and they are such a ripoff compared to the real deal in Taipei. Service is terrible, you pay for tea, no explanations like Taipei, disorganised seating, food good but not as expected
4
It's very good to enjoy the Chinese style and the food was so good. It's location is also good to seat and enjoy. Surround it covered by the building and chain of hotel.
5
Always a stop in Singapore. A great variety of dumplings, soups, and dim sum. The biggest fault is the noise level coupled with small tables The food as always was spectactular and we always seem to overorder just to be able take leftovers home with us. I cant wait for tomorrows lunch, again
5
When you eat at Din Tai Fung, wheatear you are in HK, Singapore, Shanghai or anywhere in Asia you can be sure that the quality of their food is always outstanding.My favourite are the truffle dim sum.We had a strange situation with the bill but the manager took good care of us.We will always go back, anywhere there will be a Din Tai Fung
5
Busy place at lunchtime, but there is very high turnover, and staff are super efficient. Portions are a little on the small side, but the selection (which is largely the same as other Din Tai Fungs in China/Taiwan) is very good. Dumplings are always good her
5
I eat here a lot with my lovely wife. Food is consistently good and service is fast and efficient.I am abig fan of mix and noodle. The dumplings are also excellent.The only eral hassle is having to wait inline for a table. But it is worth it.must try
5
There is always a queue, which means you get 15-30 minutes to ponder your menu selections while watching dumplings being prepared. Quite a show, actually. There are some tasty starters like centnenial egg ordrunken chicken, but the pride of the place is dim sum. There is an exceptional combination of taste and texture in all the dumplings and steamed buns. Deserts are also quite worth you attention. Service is great - and this goes for the three outlets we visited (Marina Bay, City Hall Mall, and Sentosa - the latter can get very loud with all the children)
4
This was a great find for my wife and I on our last day in Singapore. We had a few different types of dumplings and a plate of steamed chili crab buns.....If you get one thing in this restaurant get the chili crab buns, I had wished later we had gotten an order of 6 instead of just 3. I would definitely come back or visit one of their other locations
5
My daughter and I had just gotten off of our tour of the Marina Bay Sands rooftop and the weather was hot and we were tired and hungry. We decided to head into the Marina Bay Mall to see what there is for eats. Dim Sum and traditional Chinese Restaurant wasn't on our list as we were more into the local exotic eats. In any case the selling feature for us was the large glass showing you how their famous dumpling was made. So having seen that we decided to give them a try. Low and behold the best Dim Sum and Chinese Cuisine that I've ever had
5
easy to order menu not too complicated you can enjoy Michelin restaurant with a wonderful taste.
very cheap compare to quality of foods save time of your shopping.
good service they serve very quick.
4
the quality and taste of dim sum is as high as any DTF that you can find in Beijing and Shanghai. But the environment is not that good..Because if is located in a huzzling-buzzling area, it is always crowded.
5
My co-worker and I had passed this place by, assuming it was just a typical mall "food court" asian place. We were completely ignorant of the Din Tai Fung phenomenon. The next day, our local host, who is Taiwanese, told us she would take us to one of her favorite places - and to our surprise took us right to Din Tai Fung. She educated us poor ignorant anglos on the special way they hand make their dumplings, and the chaotic way they have of giving you a number and having you prepare your order on little white tickets before you are seated. It's a little intimidating. Like most queues in Asia, there is a lot of jostling, always some yelling, and just a general sense of chaos. Thank goodness she persevered, and we were able to sample the cuisine. The dumplings were AMAZING. Light and fluffy, obviously fresh, and juicy enough to cause a mess. Everything we tried was excellent, the spinach, the dumplings, we ordered what we though was way too much but just couldn't stop popping those delicious morsels into our mouths. Be warned about the setting, it IS loud and very busy, but put up with it - you'll forget all about it with your first taste of pork dumpling
3
We were staying in Marina Bay and exploring the small when we saw this restaurant. It looked very interesting as they have a glass wall allowing you see how they make the various dim sum.It would have been about 7pm on a Tuesday night we arrived and it was necessary to take a number and come back in half and hour. When we came back we were quickly seated and our order taken.Things seemed to take an eternity to arrive around 2 hours from when we first arrived and ordered), in particular the peanut dumplings. Food was above average, but certainly not worth the wait
5
I have read many of the reviews for this restaurant with some surprise and realise that we may be a little naive or inexperienced in dim sum.....however , in our limited experience we found this to be our best dim sum meal ever....maybe we got lucky. Yes the place buzzes, the wait was long but well worthwhile and yes , the service is extremely efficient but hardly smiley. We were en route to the Marina Bay Sands ( what an incredible place) in that wonderful shopping precinct when we saw the crowd outside Din Tai Fung. We stopped to watch the action and the show windows of the chefs at work and decided to endure the 30 minute wait to see if the obvious popularity was justified....well , it most certainly was and our high expectations were well exceeded. When ever we go to Singapore an absolute must will be a return to , again enjoy the best dim sum meal ever.
3
Living 2 years in Singapore i still have not figured out why that place is busy. Everyone who has been to Hong Kong must have had better dim sum than they serve in this chain restaurant. Yes it is freshly made but really not great stuff. The waiters run a around with miserable faces. You constantly have the feeling they want to turn as much tables as possible. The place is super noisy and you have to scream almost to your friends. The location is underground with no view. Feels more like a canteen place
4
Loved the freshly made dim sum especially the "siao long bao". However be prepared to wait during peak hours like dinner time. Service is brisk and efficient. The tables are placed rather close together to get maximum usage so if privacy and peace is a concern this is not the place. I wish the bill is not printed in Chinese or at least have an English translation
5
I still remember my first visit to Din Tai Fung. It was a rainy evening in Singapore, and my husband and I were mall hopping, trying to wait out the bout of rain splashing down the streets of Orchard Road. While window shopping, we passed a small groups of people waiting outside what looked like a slightly oversized coffee shop. Each group was holding a writing pad, which suspiciously looked like a cramped menu card. We were intrigued. Looking around, we saw a colourful menu board with photographs of loads of Asian dishes. While browsing through the menu we were surprised to see a small sign that said, “Top 10 best restaurants – New York Times”. Reading further we were in for another shock. The small cramped restaurant in the middle of the mall was in a fact Michelin Star restaurant. That was our introduction to Din Tai Fung.Over the last couple of years, I have frequented this place at least couple of times a month. I have pretty much tried their entire selection and here is a list of must tries, the next time you visit!Refresher drink: Lemon Grass JuiceAppetizer: - Cucumber Salad- Green Chillies with Marinated Stuffed Minced Meat- Steamed Chinese Style Layer CakesMain Course:- Pork Dumplings- Vegetable Dumplings- Egg Fried Rice- Hot and Sour Chicken Soup- Stir Fried Spinach- Crispy Prawns in Creamy Dressing with Plump Lychees & Juicy Peaches- Steamed Chilli Crab DumplingsDessert: Mango puddingDin Tai Fung, with its legacy of 40 long years of serving mouth-watering Taiwanese cuisine is a must visit. It is a fascinating outcome of a man’s journey from selling cooking oil to selling dumplings to converting a small restaurant shop in Taiwan to a Michelin Star chain in 11 countries across the globe!For more information about the restaurant and the dishes, do visit my blog: http://spicerover.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/din-tai-fung-the-affordable-michelin-star-wonder/Happy Dumplings

My favourite DTF is the one in the walkway to the Marina Sands. Last time I had to travel in Asia I made sure I had enough time to get a taxi into the city to grab a quick meal with some friends. It never fails to impress. One thing I cannot understand is why DTF is one of the few restaurants that offer something to keep your bag off the floor. You would think it would catch on. Food again was brilliant, just cannot get enough of it
5
This is our favorite chain whenever we need to have a 'xiao long bao' (steamed pork dumplings) fix. The food quality, speed & attitude of service and cleanliness of restaurants, have always been consistently great. Almost all the items on the menus are of high quality and very refine, at a reasonable mass market price. Our favorite remains the unbeatable steamed pork dumplings, braised beef and brisket, deep-fried pork rib, deep-fried prawn cake, and all the delicious appetizers. This is an awesome place. Be prepared to queue up during peak hours, but it is worth it
5
Truly my dinner here. The steamed chicken soup was divine. Service was quick and efficient. We were told to wait 20 to 30 minutes for certain orders but they all arrived within 10 mins. Top notch
4
Not sure what all the hype is about. Dumplings were good but not that much different than any dumplings I've had at a reputable, non-Michelin star restaurant.... Worth a look but don't be too concerned if you don't get around to eating here...
3
The first time we were going to Din Tai Fung by the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the line was so long that we changed our mind. After a few days, we decided to eat here because there was no line and it was a weeknight. My nieces and I ordered the following: 1) their famous truffle Xiao Long Bao 2) Braised Beef Noodle Soup 3) Stir Fried Kailan with Special Sauce 4) Fried Rice with Pork Chop.My taste in food is really good and I've eaten all over the world from the cheapest to expensive and expensive food doesn't always equate to good food. There are times when street food or night market food is even better.The Xiao Long Bao was good but it wasn't like I will crave for it once I left Singapore. The Hot Pot (dry no broth) in Singapore Chinatown was so different from any hot pot I've ever had that up to now, I crave for it. Also, as we were ordering, they were announcing for "last call to order" and didn't know that the restaurant was closing soon. They practically hurried us to eat instead of being able to take our time while eating dinner. It was rushed and they were taking the plates from our table as quickly as they could. I paid the equivalent of US$98 for our dinner. I think if we had time to order and review the menu, I would probably have ordered something different like the crispy praws with lychees, the steamed cod. I saw the reviews and probably the food here is very good and fresh. But to me it wasn't something extraordinary. The next day, we took the hop on and hop off city sightseeing tour and got off at Chinatown where we discovered their hot pot. We also saw the exact Stir Fried Kailan with Special Sauce but for way much cheaper than Din Tai Fung. It was the same! Same look and same taste. Where I live, there is a Chinese restaurant that features HongKong food and patronized by mostly Chinese. We've eaten here so many times and ordering various dishes and it always passes our taste! We're crazy for their food. I wish I could say the same for Din Tai Fung
5
After struggling with the initial concept of how this restaurant worked, we soon got the hang of it. Appreciated the pictures of each dish to choose from before ordering. We took a leap of faith and ordered a few things we weren't really sure of. The food was quick, fresh and out of this world amazing. Loved the peanut dumplings - melt in your mouth good. Can't wait to travel somewhere else where this a Ding Tai Fung
5
We were not aware of the reputation of this chain of restaurants, and struck lucky given that it was a random choice made while we were wandering through the food court near the Raffles Centre. The queue for tables was a promising sign, but we only had to wait about five minutes and were given a list of dishes to select while we waited. Once seated we were given the pictorial version of the menu, so ordered a few more! The food was excellent, and arrived in random order, as others have commented. Luckily we ordered a couple of cold noodle dishes which arrived immediately. Difficult to single out any particular dish, but the crispy shrimp pancake and the shrimp and pork parcels (sorry I can't remember the Chinese names) were memorable. Not sure I could've found this restaurant if I'd set out to go there though, as the food court and link malls are a bit of a maze
5
Loved the dimsums, the soup ones are brilliant. The wait on weekdays especially since its in the business district is a bit tedious, but the advantage is it moves fast since everyone is in a hurry. My favourite restaurant place for xiao long bao in town.
2
This statement says it all.Their dumplings came hot but it was obviously an old basket because all the soup was gone and the meat filling was dry without taste. It was also the same, for the Netherland family whose son was an international banker and whom we traded notes on how the quality has slipped beyond rescue
5
First went to a Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and the Singaporean friend I was with told me that they also had branches in Singapore. Every meal we have had there has been very good. Only irritating thing about patronising the restaurant is the queue. It sometimes takes 15 - 30 minutes to get a table
5
Haven't never had proper dim sum before we where always intrigued by the queues and fascinated by the workers in window we decided to try it and we're not disappointed! Yes we may have had to wait in the shopping mall for a table but the food was worth it! The staff are impersonal but service was very efficient and we can't complain about that . It was defiantly a unquie experience which we would defiantly try again
4
Similar to other outlets, the standard of the dim sum here is excellent.You need to get there before the rush, else you will wait to get in and then wait to pay ! Slightly annoying.However, once you get a seat, all is well.Service is swift, efficient, if a little impersonal (not surprising considering the turnover).I have yet to order something that is not good off their menu. Go for it
4
Great quality and reasonable prices. Siew Long Pau is a must try!!! The skin is not too thick and just nice! Soup in the pau is delicious!!!
5
For all the pomp, it's just another dumpling restaurant. But it's great at it. I liked watching them make the dumplings behind the glass-walled kitchen.
4
Food is authentic and awesome. Tastes close to the original DTF in Taipei. Loved the Xiao long bao and the dan dan mian!
4
We were taken to Din Tai Fung by an Aussie friend who spends quite a bit of time in Singapore. Don't be out off by the shopping mall location or the fairly basic decore. The dumplings are hand made on site - you can watch the chefs dexterously making them at a flat out pace through the window. The food is simply amazing. We had the pork and prawn dumplings which come in bamboo baskets of 10. Simply then Best dumplings we have ever had. Well worth the visit and not expensive
5
If you want the best food in Singapore do not miss din tai fung.Best Chinese food ever....must try if u visit Singapore or where ever their outlets are....dim sums are just perfect!Good value for money but one think which you need to keep in mind is that what ever you order will be just brought to your table as and when it's ready as in soups and starters can be served even after your dessert :)) yes I have got used to it now so me and my husband order accordingly n course wise
5
This Taiwanese chain which is there now in almost evert second mall in Singapore is a great place for those of us intimidated by authentic Chinese cuisine. Wide array of dim sums, wantons, appetizers like sweet 'n sour pork, duck spring rolls, noodles, vegetables, something for everyone including vegetarians....It's great value for money, no frills but efficient service with decently well done interiors. Quality is pretty consistent across the 4 branches I have been to including this one...The dump sums are the piece-de-resistance, the skill is evident and its difficult to figure out where to stop..
3
We did not have a clue how this worked but the door staff were very helpful in telling us what to do. There was about ten minute wait but in that time you write up your order and so by the time you are called to sit down everything is in motion. The dumplings are delicious and well worth the wait. The staff are very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed this lunchtime experience
5
3rd visit to Singapore, but 1st visit to Din Tai Fung, and easily the best meal ive had in the city. Located within the Marina Bay Sands Mall, plenty bars located close by for pre/after dinner drinks. We turned up without a reservation, and waited 45 minutes for a table to become available - was worth the wait. Wasnt familiar with alot of the dishes on the menu, so we decided to order a variety. Everything we tasted was amazing - especially the steamed dumplings! Place was very clean, with the chefs preparing the food in a spotless open kitchen. Not too expensive compared to other Singapore restaurants
5
Michelin star awarded and ranked as one of the worldâ€™s Top Ten Best Restaurants by The New York Times, Din Tai Fung has its roots dating back to Taiwan 40 years ago. A hot favourite with locals, Din Tai Fung offers delicious and affordable Taiwanese food that will keep you coming back for more. The service is excellent but you will need to get in early if you want to take lunch or dinner here during the week. We love the Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry, honey stewed bean curd and Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing. The health and beauty conscious locals tend to take pleasure in Steamed Angled Gourd & Shrimp Dumplings for the whitening benefits of angled gourd and Vitamin E-rich bamboo shoot. Try also the Stir-fried Hong Kong Kailan with Special Sauce. Be sure to leave room for the bean paste dumplings and freshly made pudding made from freshly sliced imported Thai mangos and be sure to marinate with vinegar the freshly sliced ginger when you first sit down and eat it at the end of your meal to freshen the palette. Watch your food being made in the open kitchen and be sure to try the soup filled pork and seafood dumplings that just explode with flavour in your mouth
3
Good experience for the first meal in Singapore. In spite of being a chain Restaurant chain, the food is excellent. We loved the wan-tan and dim sum. Crowdy but nice atmosphere. Service is diligent, but some employes don't speak english, and they forgot to bring one of beverages we ordered. Very well placed inside the Marina Bay mall. Not nice to have the bill in front of you, when we have guests
4
Need I say more? Simply delicious Xiao Long Bao. A must try if you are near any of their shops. Thumbs up!
5
Had a fantastic lunch at the Marina Bay restaurant during the working week. There was a long wait but it was worth every minute. The dumplings were delicious!
5
My family and I loved this restaurant. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I have never seen a restaurant as spotless as this one. I would highly recommend this.
3
The dumplings were very good and tasty but, there was not much vegetarian food. It was an amazing place and I must say that the dumplings were mouth watering but there really was not any vegetarian food.
5
We love Din Tai Fung. All the family enjoys it. The only problem is that in most of the locations the queu is quite long. This is the only location where there is no waiting on week ends and the parking is free.
4
Randomly stopped by this restaurant while wandering in the Marina Bay Shoppes and was immediately attracted initially by the huge crowd out front but then by the chefs working in the windows in full visibility of the public. Service is fast and efficient - you fill out an order form checklist type sheet while you wait to be seated, once your number is called you are ushered inside to a table where a flurry of servers and kitchen staff come by to drop off the items you've checked off in no particular order. Pork buns changed my life. We went twice in a 4 day span because we were so hypnotized by them. Everything is a can't miss - and the fried rice is unbelievable. I know singapore infamous for its hawkers, but Din Tai Fung is worth every penny
4
Din Ta Fung, being a chain, has fair consistent standards among the outlets I've tried. This particular branch at Marina Bay Link Mall is in fact a 10 mins walk away from Marina Bay Sands (the casino/shopping area/convention center/integrated resort). The various food outlets in Marina Bay Link Mall is patronised mostly by office workers during weekdays and have little foot traffic on weekends or bank holidays. One Sat when we had lunch at Marina Bay Link Mall, we walked over to Marina Bay Sands to check out something (partially unsheltered, need umbrella if it's raining). The branch at Marina Bay Sands had a long queue of people forming, whereas there were plenty of tables available at Marina Bay Link Mall. If you're really hungry and don't mind a short walk, head over to Marina Bay Link Mall's branch instead of Marina Bay Sands. Food and pricing are identical between the 2 branches
3
The food's really tasty, try crab and pork dumplings. The service is below many expectations. They bring you the bill before even having brought the drinks. Many of the stuff do not speak basic English and do not even try to make your lunch more comfortable and pleasant. Far from its Shanghai branches
5
This experience was amazing. My family and I went and we had a lovely time. You do have to wait for a while, but that's because so many people want to eat there. When you order your food, it comes quite quickly and by the chefs themselves. The dim-sums are amazing, I recommend the soup dumplings because of the delicious covering and the steaming tantalizing soup. The food can keep on coming because you can never get enough of it
5
With several outlets over the city (e.g.,at Paragon basement, or Marina Bay Sands B-2), this is most probably the best folded and delicious dim sum of all. Snacks like fried prawn pancakes or oriental wontons bathed in garlicky chilli sauce easily introduce the palate into all sorts of perfect steamed or fried treasures. The Asian specialties are few but well chosen also. Admittedly, these are large and noisy eateries without scenic views proper. But anyone who enjoys Singapore's lively, youth-fueled scenes and the sight of diners enjoying food and conversation is bound to like this chain
5
Here I have eaten one of the best dim sun in my life, excellent quality. Also rices and noodles are very tasty.
price-service ratio is very good
you won't be disappointed if you try it.
5
One of my most favourite places to eat. Perfectly fresh dim sum made to order. Always a queue at peak times but worth the wait.
5
Just great food, quickly prepared. I had never had 'real' Chinese food, and just was exposed to the Americanized versions in my suburban environment. This was delicious and an eye-opener. I recommend the dumplings and the buns especially, but everything was great. I only wish I could have visited this place more. You place your order at the front desk, and they will deliver once you are seated. It was easy to do, and language wasn't a problem this way. Wish I could go back soon
4
This location is serving truffle soup dumplings, albeit, expensive ($4USD for one). Darn tasty and worth the splurge. Everything else is consistent with the brand, so no disappointments. Service and wait time are usual as with every location....just go, will ya! And don't forget to try the truffle dumplings
5
As franchises go this must be rated as one of the better brands and as dumplings restaurants go it must be one of the best for consistency and quality. The Marina Bay version is set similar to all the others giving it a familiarity if you've visited any of the many other locations in Singapore, I sense it would be the same in any city one might be located.The staff are very efficient and attentive, the objective I suspect is get you in and out as quickly as possible so the next group can come and eat. And eat we did. The variety of dumplings is great, but don;t think Hong Kong Dim Sum - this is basically Taiwanese style dumplings, similar to Shanghai Dumplings, lots of pork and or crab and prawns. You must also try the dumplings in chilli soy. The most popular by far are the standard pork, however many of the varieties are equally as tasty.Do watch the expertise in the making of these little mouth watering morsels, Marina Bay again like many of the others have the chefs toiling away at the entrance whilst eager dinners watch on, satisfied these are truly hand made, each and everyone.There are certainly other options on the menu to dumplings, with a variety of noodle dishes, soups and the like, all made to the same high standard and quality.Come early if you can as from about midday it can be anything up to a 40 minute wait. And definitely go early if there are 6 or more as seating for larger groups is very limited and table turnover would be slower
5
Din Tai Fung is really a good restaurant. We ordered their specialty, the Xiao Long Bao. I've tried this in other countries but this restaurant serves it best. We also had Pork Chops, shrimps and fried rice and both satisfied my taste well. Service is also good. Ambience is fantastic than the one located near Universal. I like the fact that you can see the cooks making Xiao Long Bao. It's very interesting seeing how it's made and how manual they do it. Overall, I will go back to Din Tai Fung!
5
Din Tai Fung is a part of a Taiwanese food restaurant chain, and has a worldwide presence. In its New York avatar it was reputedly ranked as one of the world's Top 10 Best Restaurants by The New York Times, and I read somewhere that two of its Hong Kong outlets have been awarded Michelin stars.Its Singapore outlets are located in Raffles City Shopping Centre on North Bridge Road, Wisma Atria on Orchard Road,Paragon,also on Orchard Road, the Tampines Mall, the Junction 8 Shopping Centre at Bishan Place, and at Jurong Point, Jurong West Central, and the Marina Bay Link Mall.I ate at their Marina bay Link Mall in Singapore. Located in the financial district, the restaurant is always busy during lunch and dinner times, when workers from the surrounding offices descend here for food.During these hours, you might have to wait for half an hour for a table, but the waiting is worth it. We reached the restaurant a little before dinner time, and were immediately seated. In the Singapore business districts, the trick is to get to the restaurant half an hour before the rush hour. This doesn't work if you go to a restaurant in a Mall, because in a Mall, all hours are Lunch or Dinner hours.The menu is not particularly Taiwanese, it is mainly Asian. Their dumplings, even according to a quote attributed to Antony Bourdain, are the world's best dumplings. I have to agree.Xiao Long Bao dumplings- either pork or chicken,come in small steam baskets, and the minimum order is of 6 (tiny) dumplings.They are a visual delight, their silky translucence folded into a score of tiny pleats. You pick up a dumpling and dunk it into a sauce that you yourself prepare from shredded ginger and soy sauce, and wait for it to soak for half a minute. Then you transfer it into a Chinese flat bottom spoon, pierce its thin skin so that the steam escapes, and some of its soup trickles into the spoon, and then wait again for a few seconds just to make sure it has cooled. Then you pop it in your mouth. Its chewy, and the goodness of the soup within, and the flavours of the pork or chicken, along with the flavours of soy laced with ginger bursts into your mouth, awakening all the taste buds.You close your eyes, enjoy the experience, and thank your luck for finding something so exquisite, delicate and wholesome.The egg fried rice, and the noodles with mince pork were also excellent. The portions were of manageable size.The meal is served with Chinese tea, and your tea cup- a tall ceramic glass, really- is constantly filled up.Perhaps this may not be strictly local Singapore food, but after you have tried Singapore's justly famous chilly crab elsewhere, come here for food that satisfies
5
We tried Din Tai Fung on a recent visit to Singapore after it was recommended by a friend. We tried getting in for dinner but the queues made it impossible. Returning for lunch the next day we were able to find a table and our last meal in Singapore was well worth it. We tried the Chilli Crab and Pork Bau and a selection of dumplings which were, without doubt, the best I've tried in my limited experience with Asian food. Succulent and dripping juices, I could see why Din Tai Fung's dumplings are so highly rated. TOP TIPS:- Don't over-order. You'd be surprised at how filling those little dumplings are- Try the Jasmine tea. It was the best I've ever had - Get in between 12pm and 12.30pm for lunch. That's probably the only time you'll get in without a reservatio
5
Excellent choice of Dim Sum and great tasting soups. The place is not so fancy, but the taste will linger on your taste buds for long. Be prepared to wait duringpeak hours, and your your wait would be rewarded with excellent and great tasting food.Try Pork Chops and Lemon grass tea. Don't worry about the wallet as the food is very well priced, and you will not repent trying the great tasting dishes
4
We went to this place in Hong Kong, and its pretty much the same, good noodles, ok food and good prices. You come in sit on a shared table after waiting in line for your number and are handed a menu with codes that you then put into a paper and they deliver everything to your table, they do it in any order so dont expect the soup before the main dish... its as they get served. Very busy and the food is good, we recomend the beef noodles. Great place for a common meal
5
The Dim Sum is heavenly though I wish they gave larger plates that could take the weight of forks and spoons.
4
You want to eat here, you will have to prepare to wait. Love their dumplings. Try the crab fillings dumplings. Something different.
5
We had so much fun at Din Tai Fung! It is a busy place, but they manage it well. We had a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night at 8pm - but you can spend that time watching the workers through the glass windows churning out the dumplings and filling out your menu slip - selecting what you want from the menu.The dumplings were fantastic + chinese tea + noodles + greens - mmmmm. They keep refilling your tea also. I really think that this is a must - visit place in Singapore. And don't stress about the wait, its worth it
5
Very good choice of dumplings and soups as well as some pan-fried meat. Worth going there. Quick and easy but do not expect to have a super special fancy place. It's quite loud, light and you're not sitting spacious. But you're there for the food. It's yummy and you can come again to check for more variety.
4
If you're looking for a romantic or relaxing meal out, perhaps not the best place to go. But if you're looking for great dim sum in a lively atmosphere then this is your place. And the lemongrass juice is amazing!! Order a variety of dumplings and go for it!Also tried the one in Paragon - even more efficient and fast paced (they've definitely got a system that works) but the food was equally as good. Would definitely recommend for the culinary experience
4
This is one of many branches that Din Tai Fung has in SIngapore and in Asia. And like the other branches, there is normally a long line of people waiting to get a table. Fortunately they have put in place a very efficient and stress-free system which may mean a wait of anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes. But if you love dumplings and noodles, this is probably the best place in SIngapore for you to visit. Prices are reasonable and service at the Marina Bay Link Mall is efficient and courteous.Highly recommended
5
We went to this restaurant at this venue and also their venue in Sentosa and really enjoyed our experience both times. So if you can find a branch near you do take the opportunity to eat there. The fact that it was very busy both times give a good indication as to the quality of the food which is all prepared on the premises - never seen so many chefs making dim sum and dumplings by hand. Also felt it was excellent value which is a bonus. The service is excellent as you fill in your own order card and the bill arrives when they return your card to your table after inputing your order - so no having to try and catch a waiters eye to get your bill as you have to do in most places
5
I was taken here for lunch by some local SG colleagues and what a delight it was. The food is terrific and really authentic Taiwanese. Far too much was ordered so that I was able to taste lots of different dishes, but of course Doggy Bags were provided and the excess was taken away. Ordering seemed to be either by knowing Mandarin or by pointing at pictures so it could be a bit hit and miss, but I was lucky having an expert to choose for me. The decor is very bright and it is noisy but that adds tot he atmosphere which is very lively. We got there just before 12:00 noon and by 12:15 there was a large queue waiting for seats

Din Tai Fung is not just locally famous, but also world wide famous. I love Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong. I am glad to know that there're numerous of Din Tai Fung in Singapore as well :)I simply love its signature "Siu Long Bao", very juicy, warm and tasty. I also love Siu Mai (kind of dumpling), Last but not least, I love the dish of drunken chicken here. Unlike Hong Kong, this dish of drunken chicken is served bonelessly, which is good for those lazy people :)) I always enjoy my visit here and no matter what and where. Price is good, after eating 4-5 different kinds of dish, cost only SGD 20+ per person, which is very valuable.I do like to visit DTF from time to time, and I hope you do as well :

I am not a fan of Chinese food but on my recent trip ate here twice. The food is great and the service professional. They know what they are doing and you are the beneficiary. Try and assortment of dumplings to experience the offer to its fulles

Brilliant! This is a one star michelin restaurant, so nothing could go wrong. We ate there 2 days in a row and could not get enough. All the dumplings and sides are good. It is a must!
4
A great place for quiet dinner.. Not as crowded as other branches. Nice ambience..Food is the same great taste as other outlets.
4
Such good food in a traditional style in a very fresh clean setting.
Every first timer in Singapore must give this a try. The food is just great with a rel taste of Singapore. .
5
The best dumplings I had in Singapore. Fish head soup is superb, however sweet and soup soup was below my expectations. Great variety of appetizers.
Overall - wonderful food and good service.

dumpling and small dishes that compliment the noodles and excelent fried rice. The service is very fast after you manage to get your table. Everybody wait for table on a very fair first come first serve basis. For children they do have baby chairs. Especially recommend this place for family gatherings as it is comfortable, homely and food is not overly greasy as some chinese food may be

It was an amszing experience. I went there brought by some friends on my first day in Singapore. In the next 3 weeks, I went there many times. The food is delicious, the service really quick and efficient, the price is low compared with the quality and the quantity of the food. Best asian food I have ever had.The only negative thing is that the kitchen closes quite soon, that is around 10pm which is quite early for an italian :-)I am really looing forward to come bac

For the people who know Din Tai Fung: I stil prefer the Paragon location better. But this one is quite good as well.For the people who don't know Din Tai Fung. This restaurant is part of a chain, which is famous for their dumplings. Just have a look at their website and you'll see them.I think that most of their restaurants taste the same and pretty much offer the same menu.You can't reserve and there is often a waiting line: but it is certainly worth a wait. Most of the locations are in a shopping mall, so you can always have a stroll around.But anyway, for dumplings, this is just amazing. Living in Europe, I will miss Din Tai Fung again

My family and I frequent this restaurant about once a month. Last month I brought some English guests and Aussie guests there for lunch. They are sensitive to food with MSG so it was quite difficult deciding where to go. In the end I decided to bring them to this restaurant.Our usual orders are Xiao Long Bao(dumplings), duck wrapped in pastry, cucumber wrapped with sliced pork belly, noodles with chicken soup, fried rice and the various desserts available. All the food is good and served rather promptly. Do note that queues can be quite long sometimes. Usually when we have guests from abroad, we would go to this restaurant for food and then take a nice stroll outside to go to Marina Bay Sands. Good way to walk off all the food that was eaten
5
Very good Taiwanese style dim sum with a lot of choice.It is a big chain around Asia but every time we eat in any of their restaurant the food is always amazing.The atmosphere is not nice at all but with the price you pay and the family style experience there is nothing to complain.Very reasonable price. Will be back
5
Wonderful food, all dumplings are made fresh in the window shop front. The chefs are wearing hair nets, face mask and gloves. Very hygienic. You need to get the menu before entering the restaurant, fill out what you want on the order form and hand it back to the ladies at the front door. You will then have to wait for your number to appear on the board before you can enter the restaurant.. If you require more food it is possible to order once you are seated
4
Enjoyed the varied dumplings that we sampled greatly. Great attention to detail in all the flavours and kudos to the kitchen staff.
Just wish they had service staff who were more communicative or at least understood english
5
Go early as a crowd always gathers for lunch. A nice selection of dim sum. No other dim sum restaurant in the area.
5
What fantastic food and great service. Good value for money. Even my husband who's not keen on dumplings really enjoyed it.
4
The best one is the Siew Loon Pao, the others are good too. I don't like the vegetarian one very much but all the others are great. Delicious, cheap and very typical.
4
Love din tai fung. Just have to expect a small wait for a table on weekends. The menu is long, but the variety isn't that big.
4
I would say Din Tai Fung used to serve the best dumpling. I found the dumpling standard has dropped in recent visit. The filling used in the dumpling taste slightly different from the last few visitsNevertheless, it is still worth to try if you have not tried befor

This is my first time taking a meal in this restaurant although I had heard the name for quite a long time. Did not bother to try simply because I do not really fancy dumpling and taiwan style noodles. But when my husband and I were shopping at Marina Bay Sands and looking for a restaurant to have lunch, we saw this restaurant entrance was crowded with many people and had to take queue number, therefore we decided to have a try to find out why many people were willing to wait with such a long queue. We need to take the queue and before it reached our turn, we had to decide what to order as once it's your turn, one has to place the order before you go into the restaurant. But the service waas fast, once we sat down at the table allocated to us, we did not have to wait for a long time, and the food was already serving to us! Despite the heavy volume of customers, te staffs are serving very professionally and fast. With a smile too! Dining experience was good there, although it's crowded and noisy, you can see many people are enjoying! nice feeling eating your own table's food and seeing what others are ordering, enjoy it very much. I now know why most of their branches have so good business. Price wise is not cheap but worth the try!!

the famed chain from Taipei that has a cult following is just as good here as in any city in China. Main noted difference I saw here that was not on a standard menu in Shanghai or Beijing are the truffle dumplings - do not miss these! a flavorful explosion that you will not forget

In Ocotber I went to Singapore for a conference and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. While waiting for a massage in the hotel I read an article about Din Tai Fung (DTF), which sadi that it originated in Taiwan approx. 40 years ago. After my massage I found the restaurant in the shopping centre connected to the Marina Bay Sands.At every outlet (I hav enow also visited one in Sydney Australia) the dumpling production kitchen is at the front (near the enterance) of the restaurant. It was late and I did not haver to wait long for a table. The host presented me with an order form which i had to mark to palce my order. This was assisted by a menu with pictures.Their specialty is steamed dumplings served in steam baskets. I ordered way too many dishes, but wanted to try a variety.The dumplins are AMAZING. When you place one in your mouth (take the whole thing) and bite into it, the dumpling explodes with both which is encased. never before and never since have I had such a mouthful. I also tried a noodle dish with a spicy (possibly chilli) sauce which had a fantastic fragrance and taste.In Sydney, there was a slight difference with the spicy noodles, in that they had dumplings on the dish as well.While this was not what I consider a cheap restaurant, it was well worth the cost. It felt like I was in a local restaurant, with few of the waiters and servers speaking english.I loved the whole experience, because while not flashy, it felt very authentic
4
The best thing about this place is the Hot and Sour soup - WOW! Everythign is made fresh and you can see all the Chefs in the window - this place is highly recomended - some of the best food I have tasted in Singapore over the last year.It can be a pain to find so I would find find "The Sail" or Harrys at "The Sail" and head underground there and you will see it straigt away
5
the xiao long bao was absolutely amazing. for tourist that are interested in trying new dishes definitely would not want to miss this dish.
5
Well trained staff, fast service. But we had to pay .50c for service water. Over all the food was delicious
4
Food, especially dumplings, is really good, but all stuff we wanted was sold out. The atmosphere is ok, but it is too crowded and not personal at all.
5
Great dim sum, really authentic taste. Recommend the Pork dumplings and pork noodles. Felt abit rushed but i recommendations on the menu which is a plus.
2
I ate at Din Tai Fung in HK, Taiwan, Korea and Beijing. The one is Singapore should be the worst. The rest are just fine...
3
We try few times to get there but it was so busy and packed up all the time so the fourth try was successful and were not disappointed because food quality is good and authentic with reasonable price.
5
All the food including Siao Lung Pao, Fried Rice, Vegetables was superb plus very excellent service, made us return to this place the next day.
5
I will always stop here for a taste of the Asian dim sum, the great tea and the pleasant atmosphere. There are so many place to eat in Singapore that you can either just take it as it comes and stop to eat when you get hungry or have a list of places to visit for quality and variety. This is a place that would be on that list
5
This is a fantastic restaurant and although they have several restaurants all over Singapore this one tends to have other items on the menu which aren't offered at the others. What is offered here are the hot dishes like chicken with chill and beef with onions amongst others. The most central and my favourite though is the one at Raffles City Shopping Centre. I guess for the location and the service. There is one at Paragon Shopping Centre which is situated on Orchard Road but I'm not that keen on this one mainly because it is just so busy. A must from this menu would be the pork dumplings (soup inside the dumpling), egg fried rice and also the noodles with mushrooms and also to be extravagant they even have dumpings with truffles. Just gorgeous!!
5
My husband and I wanted a quick Dimsum brunch and we saw this restaurant the night before while walking around. There was a long queue and so we planned to go early the next day to avoid it. Got there at 11 am and were immediately seated. Their Xiao Long Bao is one of the best we've tasted. We also tried their prawn dumplings, noodle soup, garlic spinach and fried rice with pork which were also good. However, I thought it was a bit pricey for Dimsum especially since the Food Court was only a few minutes away
4
DTF is good - they are so popular that it is hard to get a table. I love the MBLM Din Tai Fung because it is the only one I know where you can get a table at night.
2
Wow, this place gets really busy with the casino and shopping patrons on the weekend. The food is reliably good, but it's really hard to have any kind of reasonable conversation with your friends and family.
4
dtf always have consistent taste across its chain. Just depend whether you an get a seat. This chain is especially busy even when you arrive before lunch time.
5
If you want to eat dim sum, then this is the place. Very popular as well with the locals. The service is good and the dim sums are made freshly. Make sure not to order to many...
5
At dinner time, the place gets pretty busy, so expect a wait - which will be worth it. Xiao Long Bao - little pork dumplings a bit like wontons, I could just eat a mountain of those things, and highly recommend them to everyone who is looking for a nice dinner downtown, they serve excellent noodles and soup as well. The kitchen and chefs are visible behind glass partitions so you can see the whole steaming and preparation process, service is good and the price is reasonable for a nice sit down restaurant in the area. The location is also quite central to downtown, right off one of the main MRT stations, so you can hit here on the way to nightlife elsewhere in the area
5
You must try this place. The pork dumplings are amazing, melt in your mouth! We went 3 times so we could try as many things as possible. Depending on the time you go, you may have to wait for a table but worth the wait. It is very busy. The Marina Bay restaurant is particularly cold so take a cardigan. There are others dotted around Singapore so try them too. We also went to the one in the basement of the Paragon on Orchard road, was good too.
5
Went here with friends who now stay in Singapore. Great service despite being really busy. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food. The pork and crab dim sum were amazing and the highlight. I finished with peanut butter balls covered in coconut, delicious. Very good value for money. Very clean and loved how you could watch the chefs prepare all the food.

Went here for a lunch after reading the great reviews on here. The place was very busy and we are allocated and given a number to return in 10 minutes – which is not unreasonable at 1pm! We came back on time and swiftly shown to our table. The menu is extensive and full of choice with some well know Dim Sum favourites, plus some newer dishes. The glassed kitchen wall is an amazing feature and way to see the highly skilled chefs preparing the Dim Sum by hand – including delicately tweaking the dough to the right shapes - although the staff are not keen for you to take photos. Service was functionally efficient as previously advised. Food is exceptionally good - key standout dishes included the truffle dumplings and crabmeat dumplings. The food was so ‘moreish’ that we could happily have sat here and eaten more and more. Our one top tip is try not to get seated at a table at the back of the restaurant next to the kitchen – it gets incredibly hot. Bill was a little bit more than we expected although we ate more than we expected! So all in all would definitely go back for the food, and recommend it if you are in the area
5
what a great experience! amazing flavourful food, fast efficient service and a great open plan kitchen to watch. i had read that din tai fung prided its self on cleanliness and it shoes. the kitchens are glass walled and everyone is in complete heath and safety garb, hats, nets, gloves aprons, face masks! its a surgical operation after all, creating, by hand, every little dumpling there in front of you to perfection. i also had the best beef soup ive ever had in my life, big chunks of beef cooked so that they fall apart at the slightest touch, in a strong beef stew so full of flavour. the dumplings were amazing, perfectly formed little packages of oriental joy! nice big easy to read picture menus very true to the images aswell, easy to use ordering cards and fast efficient service. 10/10 gang what a plac
2
Went here on a friday lunchtime and after a very long wait was seated at a freezing colds table in the corner. Tried to get them to very the air conditioning but I got the brush off. Ordered some dim sum with crab, and some noodles and vegetables, and some green tea. Hard as I tried I could not get the waitress to make eye contact, let alone smile. Anyway the food came out, the crab wasn't what I was expecting and the vegetables had a very strong fishy taste. Paid my bill - again emotionless, and left
4
Nice place, the shao long bao was the highlight of the menu
5
Whole family loved it! Not known for their service but the food was amazing! Great value too.
3
May be they not have the best dumplings, but its okay for price and they were everywhere have a lot of branch.
4
great dumplings. A bit of a factory but fast and tasty
4
Had good dim sum here. Truffle dumplings were amazing. Pork steam buns were not. This is just a shopping centre chain, so don't expect anything fancy. Just good, honest, tasty dim sum. Prices are reasonable.
1
I was inbetween meetings today and popped into Din Tai Fung for a late lunch. I was shown to my table my a lady who made no eye contact and only grunted. The aircon was freezing. I ordered dumplings, veggies and noodles with some green tea. the food came, it was warm but really quite tasteless. Same cold service. Paid my bill (different cashier) and not a single word was uttered.It wasn't cheap, the service was appalling, the food was bland and it was uncomfortably cold
5
What I like about this restaurant of course are their choices menu such as their dumplings, Xu Lung Bao, Fried Rice, Pork Chop, ect. What I don't like about this restaurant, since the restaurant is not that big we have to wait for quite long time to get a seat during lunch or dinner tim
3
Food is ok but really nothing fantastic. My colleagues and myself always do takeaways at this outlet. Reason being we all felt that it is not worth the wait in the queue for a table, for the service staff to take our orders and then for food to be served. Even when paying, we need to queue.We often call in to order our takeaways and still it will take a long time before we can collect our food and pay for them. I reckon that the queue is long in the MBFC outlet cos of the limited choices there and the large office crowds. Nonetheless, the xiao long bao, noodles and fried rice are considerably good, but definitely not great..
4
Portions were good for 2 persons on the amount we ordered, and the taste was subtle but very good. I enjoyed all the selections we ordered although the service can be a bit slow if you are seated in a far corner. And they don't speak anything but Mandarin well. So be prepared that they will start talking to you in mandarin if you resemble anything close to oriental features
4
This is a noisy and energetic restaurant. After being seated you are given menu's and a sheet to fill in with your selections. This is all dumplings and steamed food and once ordered is comes thick an fast. The food is very tasty and part of the fun is in using your chopsticks to pick up your selections from the centre of the table. A very nice, quick and easy meal
5
Well worth a visit and very reasonably priced. Food is prepared fresh in the restaurent so everyone can see. Even though they were very busy they had a lot of staff and we got our food quite quickly. Excellent food and good value for money.
5
Came accross this by chance while shopping my partner is not that keen on chinese food buy wanted to try some dumplings and they are fantastic! don't miss this place good food at very resonable price!
5
Absolutely loved this place. The food was excellent and the bill was more than reasonable. My favourite place in Singapore so far!
5
You must try the dim sums in this place. Amazing! Freshly made in a transperant kitchen. The price is also very reasonable for the quality. The only shame is that the staff speak little or no english
5
its one of the best chinese restaurant i have ever been, the most famous menu are liao xiao bao, fried rice & noodles. I liked the red bean buns so much
5
Please do ourself a favor and try the truffle infused xaio long bao! Yummy yummy! Also the pork chop fried rice looks simple enough, but the taste is out of this world. Cant wait to try this place again.
5
Our last meal but one of the best. The dishes are all authentic Chinese. Other than Taipai and Shanghai I have not had better dumpings
4
We went to Din Tai Fung prior to a concert on the boardwalk at MBS and yes we had to take a queue number and wait approximately 15 minutes for a table.The food was lovely and included Tofu, Prawns and rice....all in all good food, but the service was typically Singaporean and one dish was served after we had eaten all the rest ;-)The price was reasonable....Not the best Chinese food in Singapore in my opinion as it lags behind Min Jiang and others by a fair bit..
5
This is definatley the place to go for fantastic dumplings. The most amazing selections and reasonably priced. We went in twice for lunch and the service was great as well for a place that is always busy. Try the truffle dumplings they were devine and their fresh juices great
4
Din Tai Fung is one of the placed I am frequenting these days. I live close and this restaurant is very good option for simple and yet tasty food.The restaurant has incredibly efficient service. So it is certainly place where you will not wait for your dish. The dim-sums are delicious, so is the Wanton soup. Give it a try. If possible avoid lunch and dinner time during working days. The frenzy is bit too much :
5
Good atmosphere, decent pricing, quick service, awesome food and noodles, love the dumplings.
5
we ate hear after reading about it on tripadvisor, so glad we visited it!!! fantastic food and great value. a big line however you complete your order while you wait so food is served quite quickly once seated.
5
what an idea to have a shopping centre so close to the hotel
4
Beautiful fresh food served very promptly and with a smile!
5
Whenever we go to Singapore, we make sure that we eat in one of the branches of DTF. They make the prefect dimsums in the world!
4
We were still a bit full when we chanced upon this popular restaurant inside the mall, but we had to try it so we went in and tried their siao long pao, some vegetables and noodles. They were all good, though a bit pricey compared to your typical chinese food resto/food stand in lao pa sat; but well worth it. The place was packed and we had to wait in line for about 15 minutes! Try it
5
Great food at good prices. Very BUSY place.... gotta wait in line at the wrong time of day. But real amazing chinese food. It always is crowed (tables close together to fit max amount of customers) so it is not a place for a long enjoyable dinner. Best for a quick lunch! We went three times in one week (because of great quality at better prices than most in Singapore
4
This is one of several chain restaurents in Singapore and elsewhere (including Sydney). All have the same formula and a similar menu, mainly based around dumplings cooked in an open kitchen.Quality was excellent, with the pork dumplings (containing soup) the stand out choice. A great option for a quick lunch or dinner, and a step up from all the other take out and cafe food available at Singapore malls
4
The dumplings here were fantastic, and it was very cool to see a team of 5 masked men making them in the window. The service is a bit Indifferent, and the menu is fairly limited, but if you want a quick, delicious meal near Marina Bay Sands, this is the place
4
The food was great and to see how they make the Dim Sum was very interesting, but to sit in this restaurant was like sitting in a freezer. The aircondition is put so cold that I caught a cold and just wished to leave this place as fast as possible. The service was fast but not very friendly. I missed the usual smiling faces
