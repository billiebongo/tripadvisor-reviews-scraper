Decent food for reasonable price....lots of choice and friendly staff, it is located just opposite Mustafa centre and Angullia Mosque. Lovely shopping area...

The food variety looked good and was reasonably priced, although I had already eaten and just popped in for a drink.
I ordered a traditional yogurt-based drink, the mango lassi.
Creamy, tasty and refreshing, not bad at 3.80SG.

Good selection of Indian food with a slight twist on the traditional dishes. We tried the Chicken Dosai and the Chicken Kothu.

For tourist who love shopping at Mustafa Center, AB Mohamed will relieve your hunger. Not only cheap (than fast food) but also generous portion.
The server can speak Bahasa Indonesia as well.

The food is definitely above average, but not that great. Very Good would be exaggeration and average is under-estimation. Recommended to try (especially Dosas). Huzayf

A B Mohamed is a long standing restaurant near the famous Mustafa complex. The food at this resraurant is phenomenally tasty and packed with flavour.The coin paratha is the pick of the bunch on the menu and is one of the main items that A B Mohamed is famous for.

There are 2 ABM Restaurants. One next to Mustafa Centre on the Syed Alwi Road and the other on the opposite side.They have super “Dosai” collection. Try their Paper Dosai & Masala Dosai. Also they have Sri Lankan “Idiyapppam” String hoppers served with Mutton curry. Both restaurants are very clean and air conditioned with friendly staff.Highly recommended for families with children

Excellent food very reasonably priced. Non-veg food available. I like the dry lamb curry, squid curry and deep fried fish slice..ate with Masala dosa. Will highly recommend this place. Stff is very helpful and courteous. It is next Penta Hotel where i have stayed..name has changed A One Restaurant

Was there with a couple of friends who live in canada and back here for holiday.My friend recommended this little restaurant with aircon . I order the dosai $3.90 my friend order chicken chapati $6.80 and her husband had naan.The paper dosai gravy that go with it is very nice better than those in hdb hawker centre. Went home to my husband he said hawker centre charge $1.80, but to me is ok $3.90 as long as I can afford and the taste is good
