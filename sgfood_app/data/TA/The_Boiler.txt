Very unique experience to eat seafood on the table. Very tasty and friendly service. Everyone must try especially with promo on birthday.
5
Service and the food are all great!
We love the crab and lobster with the 'works' sauce.
The lava cake and finger food are nice too.
Great place to have food coma with friends, drink & Chill & relax after 5.

Food is not bad but location requires you to walk a fair bit. Feels abit understaff but Anna was very friendly and nice

I had counted on returning to Boiler with my family during CNY and was bummed that I could not get a reservation! Managed to book a table on Tuesday evening. It was barely 7pm when we arrived and the restaurant was already packed with diners! That said, we did not wait long as our orders were served within half an hour. The fresh seafood boil in their signature sauce was impressive and we thoroughly enjoyed the generous servings from their Bombdiggity bag. For some variety, the friendly waitress suggested that we could have our lobsters cooked in a different sauce and we got to sample the black pepper butter sauce which was a good throwback on Singapore’s black pepper crab dish. If you love ‘em spicy, try the seafood with either sauce. Other must-trys included their fish and chips, chicken tenders and the yummy fish skin coated with salted egg.

Bombdiggity Bag is da bomb! Seafood is fresh and excellent sauce that goes with the seafood. Great selection of beers, crafted beers and even non alcoholic drinks.Service is great too! The crew are attentive and they even help you put on your disposable aprons. Disposable handphone sleeves are provided to prevent the sauces from staining your phones as well.Special mention to a crew by the name of Wayne! Always serve with a smile.Good food, Good drinks, Good service.Really worth every dollars and cents.Will definitely return

It was a great experience to dine @The Boiler at Howard Rd. I had a great dinner at The Boiler with my family. We ordered The Bombdiggity bag with the Works sauce with some sides such as fish & chips, spam fries salted egg fish skin,etc. The Works sauce was fantastic and the seafood were very fresh and succulent. Staff was professional, friendly, prompt and provide great service. We enjoy ourselves and we will be back for more !

We were there last night and were lucky to catch the lion dance which the restaurant has engaged for the Lunar New Year! Enjoyed the very fresh seafood in their signature sauce, loved the prawns, dungeness crab, clams and corn!!! Also loved the chicken tenders and the sriracha chill cheese fries! Will be planning our next gathering there again soon!!

Let me start with the positives, because there’s almost always something a restaurant gets right. In this case it’s what most people come here for; the seafood. The main course was a plastic bag (yup – saves cleaning up) of prawns, clams, mussels and lobster (plus some rather unpleasant bits of industrial sausage) in a really rocking garlic and chilli sauce that The Boiler calls ‘the works’. It was huge. I was stuffed. Starters consisted of the sort of breaded, fried stuff that most fried food places should be able to get right.So let’s talk about what was wrong with this place – and it was a lot and I’m still angry. The bill for two for a Valentine’s Day dinner at this place busted right through the SGD200 mark. For that sort of money, in a town where you can find great food everywhere for $5, I expect a certain minimum of consideration and service. The Boiler is bad.From the start the service gave the distinct impression they didn’t care. Every single time we needed a server we had to fight for attention. The boss/maitre’d or whoever the guy in charge was would look straight through us or wave us away. It was simply rude. At no point did I feel like anything other than an inconvenience who was spending a goodly chunk of money on dinner and helping to pay the wages of people who didn’t give a stuff.Nor could they get simple things right. The Valentine’s dinner included a glass of Prosecco each. It didn’t arrive. It didn’t arrive until after the dinner had finished because they’d forgotten/didn’t care. I had to remind them, so we had our drink having finished the rest of our food. But that meant we were thirst while we were eating. So would we have water? Sure, if we paid for it. Tap water? No – company policy is not to give people tap water. I’m spending $200+ dollars here but that’s not enough for them. I can imagine some tight fisted owner in a back room determined to screw every damned dollar he can from the poor schmucks who eat here. So we order beer – 2 Brew Dog Punk IPAs – great beer. Only what turns up is another IPA by some Californian brewery that can’t. Punk IPA is a hoppy, refreshing wonder, this stuff was dull. But it arrives with the tops off and no apology. When I ask where the beers we ordered are I’m told they don’t sell it any more and what they have is this – “Same taste” I’m told. They so don’t care. They knew they didn’t have what I asked for when I ordered it and did the old switcheroo.It was Valentine’s Day. It was a special meal. I wanted a nice time so I did my best not to spoil it for my partner by complaining then and there. But this was a special meal right royally wrecked by the sheer unprofessionalism and greed of a very, very average establishment. It claims to sell the best seafood in Singapore. Hahahahahahahahaha. For this money I could have had a better experience elsewhere. I’ve had outstanding Michelin Star meals in the UK for less than this. They’ll never get a single penny from me again and they shouldn’t get a single penny of yours unless you have a masochistic desire to spend money to be treated with contempt.

We visited The Boiler after seeing friends having a great time there on social media - and it proved every bit as good as it is hyped. The pure "hands-in" eat from the table experience was refined by the use of plastic gloves for your hands and plastic pouches for your mobiles! The seafood which was the star of the show was fresh, succulent and extremely well cooked - the accompanying sauces were great too! Try the garlic butter to allow the natural flavours be enhanced. Our only complaint - more options for something to soak up the lovely juices - the mantou was great but a tad small for the job and one would have to buy a dozen to adequately feed a growing teen! Still, it was a great meal indeed
3
Needs a bit of travelling time to get there. Nestled in a quiet corner among a industrial park. Portions pretty big.
5
This was our second visit. Absolutely enjoyed the seafood combo bag with its unique 'The Wake' sauce. Highly recommended!
4
Had a fun and messy meal here with friends. We enjoyed the tasty Bombdiggity bag, spare ribs, and spicy wings. The Sri Lankan crab was massive and actually quite sweet.
4
We had the set meal and it was really tasty. Great selection of seafood and beautifully cooked. I preferred the garlic butter to the mild hot sauce, but both were pretty good.
3
it seems that this way of serving is a trend and young people seem to enjoy it. the food is nice, well cooked but highly overpriced. I don't understand why the sausages are included, we came for seafood. Service was good. Read more about this serving style before you go there, it was not our style for eating
4
The Boiler is a place that serve very good seafood. The Boston lobster. Sri Lanka crab and prawns were very fresh, but we miss out on the Dungeness crab which was not available that evening. Service was very good, and waiter/waitress were attentive. Beer selection is limited but acceptable since they are main selling point is their food. Atmosphere was good, and deco is minimalistic as it is located at an industrial area
5
Located near TaiSENG mrt maybe just 5-6mins walk. Easy to spot Becos of the lighting even this food on the pricey side but quality and crab was fresh and good.. free lobster for birthday with the purchase of bombdiggity..FISH AND CHIPS WAS BOMB LOVE IT And I would go there for it.
4
My first time here and we were celebrating a birthday. We ordered the Bomb Diggity Bag and got a free lobster! (Must show IC for proof). The Bomb diggity bag is just nice for 3 adults I think. There were 4 of us adults so it's just nice but not filling enough. We also ordered the sweet potato fries as well as the tender chicken, both are really nice. The coleslaw tasted fresh too. We ordered the seafood bag with The Works sauce in mild. It taste flavourful with a nice spiciness to it. It was just nice without being too spicy. We tried the desserts offered: waffles & ice cream (waffle doesn't seem freshly made and dry); lava cake (nice gooey and chocolatey); and the pot sundae with gummy worm (vanilla ice cream with oreo crumbs placed in a plastic terracota pot and a spade spoon). Overall the food is good and I would come here again with friends next tim
4
While the restaurant name is somewhat shortened, the food quality remains unchanged. It has been sometime since our last visit and it is good that it finally has managed to include beer in the menu. Keep up the great food - but do try to add wine to your menu as well, and for the staff to be more attentive to the guests. It took us a minute to get the attention of the waiting staff each time we needed their help
4
Visited after reviewing a post and without any prior idea what it is going taste, we thought of give it a try. Overall the taste not too bad, it with Louisiana flavor. Have not been there but it is definitely another option other than Chili/Black Pepper sauce. All seafood are fresh and the lobster and crab are from West coasts of State. The meat are solid. The seafood bag was nicely flavor with their signature sauce “The Works”. The Lobster? Was on the house as it was for a birthday celebration, Thanks
5
The food is really good, ordered bombdiggity bag, boiler's sampling platter and had a free lobster due to friend's birthday which falls within the month. The lobster was chewy and food came piping hot!! Will come back again!
5
The seafood is fresh and sauces are special. During the birthday month, they even have complimentary lobster.
3
Decent place for gathering with friends.
Set dinner isn't cheap but not on the high end.
Food was reasonable.
The location was a bit out of the way off Macpherson Road & Tai Seng industrial area.
3
Celebrated my hub birthday there, we were assigned to a 2nd storey restaurant, lights too dim, doesn't have the restaurant atmosphere. Food wise was average only, variety very limited. Only thing I enjoyed was the red wine recommended by the waitress.
4
The food was good and we went another time in the same month. Even better when you visit on your birthday month.
5
Was seated level 2 to a building next to the main restaurant , but was quiet but too cold, we came for the free lobster with the order of the Bom bag $149 only for birthday month, cold beer was nice too, if you like spicy go for the medium, mild was ok for us too, quality and service was good overall
4
Have been seeing the birthday promotion where you get a free lobster. Sadly it's only for the 4pax portion seafood bag. I only got two pax that night and it's impossible to finish a 4pax portion.. so we forgo the lobster. We always love their garlic butter sauce!
4
Located in an industrial estate, The Boiler is cool place to hangout with friends and families. The seafood is fresh and ambience is nice although the industrial decor style means that it can become very noisy when the restaurant is packed with diners. A popular dining place means that you need reservations but do arrive on time or your table might be given away to diners waiting in line. Service is prompt even when it is crowded. Great place for families too. Do be prepared to use your hands to eat!
4
Came here to celebrate our sister’s birthday, here is what we think:Ambience: 4/5Customer Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4.5/5Quality of Food: 4.5/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders:Premium Seafood Combo for 3-4 Pax: 4/5Ribs for Two: 3.5/5The Good: Great ambience and very wholesome way of eating and chatting over the meal.The Bad: We thought that it was ok, we had only 1.5 hours to eat, so was a bit rushy, food quantities are great, it’s a very feeling! The Bottom Line: Great to come back here again, we would re-visit when our seafood cravings comes again, great experience
4
Went to celebrate my partner's birthday at The Boiler, despite people saying that it was very hard to get reservations, we still managed to get a good table in spite of us reserving the day before. We ordered The Boiler's Speciality Set (3 to 4 pax). The crabs given were very generous. Although the "signature 'the works'" sauce can be improved as it was too oily and not as thick to dip as Dancing Crab. Overall, quite a satisfactory first experience.
5
Fish in a sack that was special and eating with your hands was a great experience also the ribs were great with special fries and friendly service to a acceptable price
5
Our family favourite! We always celebrate our birthdays at The Boiler as we loveee the lobster. The Bombdiggity Bag is da bomb indeed. Best cajun seafood in town!
5
Out of the world taste!
Sure to bring my overseas guests there & always leave feeling satisfied & happy!
5
Took the bombdiggity bag with the works Chilli sauce. Dungeness Crabs prawns and clams are incredibly fresh. Lobster in garlic butter is a must try too.
4
My first time dining at restaurant. Was pleasantly surprised to find restaurant located in midst of industrial buildings. Restaurant ambience is relaxed and casual, setting the right mood for a wonderful culinary experience.Although a little pricey, the novelty of eating crabs, mussels & lobsters using gloves provided and donning plastic protective bibs is great idea. Seafood served in plastic bags and diners eat without cutlery or plates. Just enjoy food and litter the table. How often are you allowed to create a mess
5
Heard so many reviews about this place but never got a chance to try as it is always full house. Tried my luck on Tues and manage to get me and my wife a seat. The moment we got off the car, the scent of spice already whetting our appetite. One look at the menu and the choice was clear. Bag for 2 with Crabs and the famous recommended sauce.Was so tempted to include the lobster which were on promo, but was afraid we were unable to finish the food. Service was impressive as the service crew was very attentive. The food was prepared in no time although the place was full house.Everything was so excellent, prawns were fresh, sri lankan crabs were of good size. generous servings of mussels and clams with a corn that is just soo nice and sweet. The sauce is just too good! I had to order extra man tous (fried buns) just to finish the delicious sauce. It is recommended that you bring more people along so that you get to try more other stuffs in their menu. will sure to visit again
3
Had 900gram dungeoness crab with their house special sauce @ $85 and lobster with garlic butter @ $55 promo price Pretty full after having the 900g crab by myself... probably suitable to be shared by 2 peopleAlthough I prefer their sauce compared to dancing crab house sauce... but after sometime the sauce started to make me “muat”.....ended I just ate the crab with minimal sauce and enjoy the natural sweetness of the crab.probably due to my Asian taste buds I still prefer my chili or black pepper crab sauce... simply dumpling did say he loves Singapore chili /black pepper crab more than any crab he had so far in USA.Probably will try their sauce of the month should I pop by this place again.One thing I notice.. their glass windows u can see sauce splatter stains... I presume it was stained by customers on the same day
5
Went to the Boiler for dinner tonight and it was full house even though it's a Sunday night. Ordered their signature bag for 4 person, truck load of seafood in such a big bag. Love the dungeness crab, prawns and sweet corn. So fresh, sweet and succulent and goes so well with the signature sauce, the works in medium level. We had a free lobster as it's my dad's birthday. The lobster goes so well with the pepper butter sauce. We also ordered the salted egg yolk fish skin, nothing beats freshly made fish skin (so much better than the prepacked ones, IMO) Tried their new beer, Banana bread beer, so yummy with my chocolate lava cake! Such an out of this world pairing! Totally enjoyed tonight's dinner, food was fantastic, superb service eventhough the place was crowded and value for money. Most importantly, birthday boy was so happy. We will def be back
5
Enjoyed a wonderful meal at The Boiler!! Love their signature sauce, The Works...we had the spiciest -raging hot!! The sauce goes very well with the fresh seafood and the fried mantou! We also ordered the fish and chips, Louisiana ribs and a few other sides. Everything was so good!! Service was prompt and attentive though it was crowded
5
The restaurant sits at the heart of MacPherson commercial patch and easy to spot with its attractive restaurant decor and fascia signboard. Our dining experience was phenomenal - we ordered 2 Bombiggity bags and were greeted by generous servings of fresh crabs, prawns, mussels and clams! The crustacean delights didn’t stop there as the restaurant threw in free lobsters as part of a special promotion! Be prepared to be bowled over by the Works sauce if you love it savoury with hint of spice. Those with a light palate should try out their garlic butter sauce. Both sauces worked well with the fresh seafood. Will highly recommend this place!!
5
Best lobster! Best crab! Best seafood in Singapore.
Very innovative with new dishes. Very nice ambience
5
The food is so delicious ! Seafood really fresh especially lobster and crab was so yummy! Service and Ambience is excellent ! Must try when In sg holiday ya. Really give them DOUBLE LIKE !!
4
Hidden in an industrial estate, the place is not as crowded- which is great. Good place to have a happy meal with friends.
5
Although it was in an industrial building area, the place was not hard to find. Food was amazing, and service was prompt.
5
Good food, good drinking , with great company! Highly recommended for gatherings with friends and family alike.
3
If you want to eat overpriced but well cooked sea food out of a plastic bag with your hands then this is the place for you. Service was quick and the food ok, but too expensive.
4
This place was hidden in an industrial estate. When we reached at 11:56am, door was still locked. But within 10mins of us sitting down, the whole place was packed. Tried Fish & Chips Lunch Set, portion has heartily and taste great! My friends shared a seafood platter that served in plastic bag and you just throw on the table. Well, they covered the table with waxed paper. Recommended when one is in the area, just be early.
4
We were group of 3, went for the birthday promo >> Bombdiggity bag (for 4 pax), with a free Boston Lobster. Added-on homemade ice lemon tea (refillable) for drinks.Serving size was good for 4, no complains!Free lobster & seafood in the bag (crab, clams, mussels, prawns, scallops) were all very fresh, corn & sausage were good too!Service was good too despite the crowd, very fast & responsive when we requested for refills & more serviettes etc.Reservations definitely recommended for weekend dinners. Note each seating is limited to 90mins. Place can get a bit noisy, but overall environment is still ok..
4
The service provided by the staffs were simply fantastic. Dishes were served out rather fast with a full house crowd. The only down side to us was that all 7 of us felt very thirsty after the food. Not sure whether it was MSG or other reason.
3
I was promptly attended to and shown to my seat. However, I was taken aback that I am only allowed 1hr 30mins in the restaurant. As it was my 1st experience in Boiler, I was caught off guard as I was hosting some guests. Overall, the servers were attentive. Nothing to complaint about.The food was okay and nothing to shout about, except that the dining experience was unique - Using our hands to eat the food including fish and chips. My guests and I are fine to go "stone-age". Overall, ok experience
4
Food is nice and the ambience is cosy for family gathering. Service is prompt and the servers are polite.
5
We had the boston lobster which was a good size. bigger than i expected. The sauces recommended by the staff were good too. only allowed 1.5hours of eating time though but it was sufficient for the 2 of us.
4
Food was great, yummy, seafood were fresh. The red sauce was fantastic while the garlic butter sauce lacked garlic (red sauce tasted more garlic-y). Staff was helpful and friendly as well.
4
Happy hour was good.
however, as they were closing, we had to leave the premises. else it would be nice to chill at the place as the ambience was great.

My 6 years old daughter wanted to go Boiler to celebrate her birthday. However as she is only in K2 and do not have any bus pass nor student card, she was denied of the free lobster for birthday month.It is my own fault where I did not carry her Birth cert with me, although I was able to show a copy of it from my phone. Forget about the lobster then! I spent almost $500 for the night, and it shall be my last since you cannot even make a 6 years old girl feels special on her birthday!
5
I first visited The Boiler 2 years ago to celebrate my birthday. As we had a very good experience back then, my wife suggested we visit it again. It is still as good. Yummy food and attentive staff. We took the Boiler's Duo Bag ($52) with Lobster ($55) as recommended instead of Boiler's Bag Plus ($92 with Sri Lanka crab). Definitely more worth it and what is not to love about lobster!Already thinking when we shall visit it again. Of course it will be more fun with a larger group
5
Good for those who like to get their hands dirty (love that they provide aprons and even a plastic pack to put your phone in), do it yourself style. I felt like I was at home enjoying a homemade dinner. All around enjoyable experience eating seafood. If you're a seafood lover like me, it won't be your only visit.
4
One of our favourite louisiana seafood places! Love the freshness of the seafood and louisiana spice mix. Portion size was decent and sides complement the mains and were of good quality.The only letdown was where the staff insisted in using my phone (without asking for my permission!) to access the chope vouchers. Other places would just note down the reference number and work on their own devices backend
4
Main courses (seafood bag & free lobster) were fresh & good! Sweet potato fries were good too! Drinks ok. Dessert (lava cake) was tasty (but came cracked open). We were seated next door, 2nd floor. Nice setting as it's not as crowded/noisy (note, stairway might not be as convenient for kids/elderly). Service was overall good!
5
Made a booking for 8 pax over the weekend for dinner. The main hall was full so we were accommodated at their sister "branch" just 20m down. It's actually a wine/ whiskey joint but they have a second floor which sits about 5 table of 6-8 seats. Service was prompt and friendly. Food- Wouldn't call it cheap BUT you are getting fresh and proper size seafood here. Not micro sized mussels or clams . These are proper seafood. Food came in less than 15 mins after order. Throughout dining, wait staff was always around if you needed anything. Would definitely return!If anything , I would only comment that maybe a self service tap water corner would have been perfect. Just add the cost into your food if you must. Ordering for bottled water does leave a bitter(sort off) taste to the overall
5
good services and great food. perfect place for gatherings which my group enjoyed thoroughly. staff were all attentive.
4
Seafood is fresh but it is rather pricey. Garlic butter sauce is good but their bestseller spicy sauce lack flavour. There is free lobster if the guest's birthday falls in that month.
5
The food are amazing as usual and this time I brought my Father in law to celebrate he's b'dae. Definately will revisit
5
the seafood is ultra fresh, especially the prawns (even fresher than Dancing Crab's), ambience is nice too. will be back for more!
5
good service and good food.. keep it up .. the standard is always consistent and top notch... would recommend
5
Food is good, staffs are friendly and attentive, great atmosphere. Came for eht anniversary $3 lobster. Yum, you can really get what you pay for! Will definitely visit again!
5
We had the original fish and chips and the one with the salted egg sauce. We preferred the original. Crispy outer batter with extremely tender & moist fish inside.The boiled prawns in butter sauce and spicy sauce were superb, as usual. Might even be better than Cajun King's, which was our old favourite Cajun place, but has closed for good, unfortunately.Also had a decent jambalaya pasta
4
Finding this place was a good surprise, I was looking for a nice restaurant to having lunch near Ubi Avenue 4 (ComfortDelGro Driving Center) but didn't find a really nice or at least comfortable place near by the area, so I had a look in TripAdvisor and found "The Boiler" and said: Let's give it a try! My comments: the food is pretty good, and the atmosphere is very nice even for having lunch! Definitely I'll come back!
5
Must order the bombdiggity bag ($149)! Portions are generous (corn is unbelievably sweet and juicy) and sauce is very tasty and spicy. Seafood is super fresh. Love their nachos fries too! Drinks wise the berries cider is awesome. You can give the dessert a miss.Ambience is relaxing and cosy too, perfect for an evening chill out session with friends.
5
I was attracted to book this restaurant because of the $3 lobster promotion which chope notified me. I expected that it will be a marketing gimmick and was pleasantly surprised that we were served a full size lobster. We ordered the bag of mixed seafood and were impressed with the food quality as well as the sauce on it. Service was excellent and we had a young male server who was quick to offer a warm drink to my mum who was in her late eighties and couldn't understand why she had to pay for warm water. It saved a tricky situation and indeed this is the type of service that turns an ordinary outing into one that I will remember . Well done
4
I took our entire staff to The Boiler for lunch. I had bangers and mash...absolutely great. Not one of the 17 staff complained and all were impressed with the food!
4
An awesome service by server JJ made the visit even more enjoyable. No doubt food was tasty and its such a pleasure to end the work week with a wonderful dinner!
3
Housed in an industrial estate, The Broiler serves Louisiana seafood. The food served is decent enough. Does not serve plain water though.
5
Service staff was friendly and helpful. The seafood was tasty. Portion was just nice for 5. Great beer!
5
The food, ambience and setting was great. Just perfect for a wrap party. Love the idea we had to eat with our hands. Will definitely be coming back.
4
Family dinner, there is room for improvement for standard of food. Sauce of the day is dilute. Service is good,
5
The staff, Pun was really friendly and patient. He never failed to explained each item and took the time to explain how the promotions worked.
4
The Bombgiggity Bag was a bomb of an experience. We ordered the one with laksa flavor. We also had a $3 lobster because of their 3rd anniversary. We were a party of 5 and the food was more than sufficient. And the taste was unforgettable. A cosy place which was cleverly located to avoid the high rentals of prime properties and hence the ability to pass on the savings to patrons with affordable food and good servic
5
Excellent Boston style Seafood that comes in a bag and poured out on top our table which is covered with paper. We ordered a seafood in a bag that have crabs, prawns, corn, sausages. Because we have a birthday celebration, we also was given a free lobster. Have eaten here on numerous occasions and I am still loving it
2
We were here for dinner-ordered 2 starters and 2 mains.Our mains came first, followed by 1 starter. As we were about to complete our meal, we had to enquire what happened to the other starter. The waitress said she needed to ask and then told us subsequently that it would take another 5 minutes to cook. We decided to cancel the order since dinner was almost over for us. And obviously kitchen had left out the order.But what surprised us most was that she kept coming back to ask us to reorder the starter. She did not seem to understand the meaning of a starter! We also observed that the servers generally congregated at the bar counter with their backs to the diners. So getting their attention was a little difficult.Although the servers are friendly, they are also obviously very poorly trained.The food is quite mediocre as well. So definitely will not be back
5
Chance upon Chope when looking for a makan place. After browsing, looked up Boiler and the reviews and decided to give it a try since it's rather near to my work place.
4
Booked a dinner for my 14th wedding anniversary. Nice place, nice people, nice foods!!! We enjoy the dinner. Next visit will bring my kids along...
4
Walking distance from Tai seng MRT, the boiler serves fresh seafood in a bag. Visit this place during your birthday month to receive a free lobster (with the purchase of 1 seafood bag for 4 Pax).
3
Ordered 2 bombgiggity bag, some regert on the food, some prawn not fresh, one of the crab is not fully cooked. The butter garlic sauce was too bland. The works sauce was better.
Service was prompt.
4
Interesting way of eating seafood..ordered the bombdiggity bag and a duo bag. The sauce in the bombdiggity bag was tasty with medium heat, the pepper sauce for the duo bag was a tad too peppery and overwhelming for our liking. Overall food and service was good
4
Ordered the Bombdiggity bag (sharing for 4) with The Work sauce, mild, to share among 3 of us. Portion wasn't very big. In addition, we had a free lobster (w/ Garlic Butter sauce) due to birthday month. The Work sauce goes very well with the bun.Only problem that bother us was the meal was limited to 90 minutes. We are enjoying our seafood in a stressful mood as all of us are slow eaters. Nevertheless, the seafoods are very fresh
4
This is our 3rd visits to the restaurant. Service and food quality has never failed us. However, it seemed that the portion has cut back a little on the Bombdiggity Bag. With the Birthday deal of free lobster thrown in, then it may be more reasonably priced. We love the chocolate lava cake, but there again for $8.90, it kind of pricey
5
Love that the fish batter in the fish & chips was soft in the inside and crispy in the outside; no fishy smell. The prawns and Dungeness crab were sweet, typical of a fresh crustacean. We ordered The Works Ragin Hot sauce and the spiciness is tolerable for Indonesian tastebuds. Its taste is not the same as Boiling Crab's but great as an interpretation.
5
Really enjoyed ourselves the evening with their specialty - duo plus with medium spicy signature gravy. The service staff offered simple yet delightful gesture by taking wefies for us. The other even offered a ice bucket for our beers as their happy hour policy dictates all beers to be served at once. Hmm.. probably new crab crackers or rubber mat for more grip as we wrestle the crabs. Nonetheless, we will come back for more and thank you all for the wonderful experience and services!!! Keep it up!!
5
Made a reservation for The Boiler through Quandoo.sg.The restaurant was quite busy, and it was easy to see why: The seafood maintained it's extremely high standard for freshness, preparation, and presentation. Every bite from Duo bag plus (a perfectly prepared bag of crabs, prawns, clams and shellfish), to the Lychee Beerjito & Beerita and Chocolate Molten Lava cake was a delight!In addition, our server ( Ms QianHui) was prompt, efficient, polite, thorough, and yet not in any way intrusive or over-bearing. While the staff was kept busy by all of the diners, we in no way felt rushed or hurried.A truly wonderful dining experience ~ the best we've had in McPherson!
5
Service was excellent - Greg and Irving was attentive to us. Since it is our first time there, they provide great recommendation on the food. Food and ambience was really good too. A chillax place on a Saturday afternoon.
4
Great food and great service from our server Pun! Best to go with an empty stomach! On your Birthday month you get a whole lobster for free!
4
Went with a group of 5girls. The food was great, ordered the signature and butter sauce. But pricing wise, personally feel that it's pretty pricey for its portion. Would be perfect if they tune the pricing. Paid $80 per pax.
5
Love the service there, it was great and the ambiance is awesome for the gathering.
the fish and chip is really awesome and the portion is just right.
4
Easy to book with chope.
Excellent fun and vibrant place to have a party with friends.
Seafood in bag was excellent and everyone were pleased with the attentive customer service.
Will go again.
5
We had an excellent experience at the boiler. Staff provided great service despite being understaffed. Food was good. Would visit again!
4
Fresh seafood, great sauce, got the free lobster as we had a birthday boy. Portion slightly smaller even with the lobster. Feeds 3

The only set back of this visit was limiting us to dining time of 90 mins; we were only informed that there is a 90 mins dining restriction like few hours before reservation time through an sms. This really disturbed and stressed our dining mood. Can imagine the stress of having to eat seafood in 90 mins.

Decided to check this place for late lunch since I'm nearby checking out some warehouse sale. Ordered the lunch of the week which is Salted Egg Fish & Chips with Cajun Fries.Initially I thought the Salted Egg was a dip but in the end it's just a little bit of sauce on the Fish. The Cajun Fries was with salt too which normally I wouldn't expect it. However having said that, the fish is fresh and not overly oily. Service by the staff was great too.Though not much of a view but I find it's a great place to chill out with friends without all the Orchard road type of crowd you see walking outside the restaurant. They do have those seafood in the bag as well which I might come back to try if I'm able to find kakis to go with me to try it

Tai Seng is probably the up and coming district for foodie. New cafes have sprouted and one eatery that has been there for a while is Boiler. Boiler is probably a 10-minute walk from Tai Seng Mrt station but the streets can be a bit confusing so advice is to follow the gps. Boiler serves seafood in da bag at a decent price and on Birthday months, diners can receive a free Boston lobster with every Boilerâ€™s Bombdiggity Bag. Apart from the seafood, I particularly like their salted egg fish skin. The service is good and diners are provided with a bib, gloves and plastic bag for phones. It gets crowded during dinner and they'll typically restrict dining to 90 minutes, especially if there's a queue.

The food is not as nice anymore. Service was ok. Price is extravagant. Will not consider visiting again.

I rarely receive good service in restaurant but this caught my attention. The crews are nice and smiling always. We ordered garlic butter for the sauce. it's delicious!
5
Good food and good service. Ambient is good. Food is fresh. Location is quite near MRT. About 5 mins walk.
5
Great place for delicious seafood . Service was good. Seafood is fresh. Great atmosphere and ambience.
5
While the restaurant was quite crowded, we managed to find a place quickly. Food was served promptly and the taste did not disappoint.

Went with a party of 8. Ordered the seafood in a bag - crab, clams, prawns, mussels, corn and even sausage chunks in garlic butter sauce. Tasty n Fresh! Also ordered Fish n Fries - fresh, lightly battered n crispy. Each order was a good portion of 3 fish fillets. Everyone got down to finger lickin goodness. Special mention to QianQian who served us smilingly, efficiently and took the initiative to present the cupcakes to the bday gal in our party on a decorated platter.

We had a fantastic casual meal at The Boiler! We were two people and opted for the Boiler Duo Plus option (which included crab) on the menu with The Works sauce (mild), as well as Garlic Butter sauce. The restaurant was full, but food arrived quickly. There were several large tables with birthday celebrations, so it definitely looks like the type of place you want to bring a large group of friends to. They gave us plastic covers for our phones, and said: "when we dine, our phones dine with us." Incredibly smart considering there are so many foodies who want to Instagram their food photos. Our meal arrived in a boiler bag. No plates, no cutlery, you just dig in and enjoy! The crab was sweet and the prawns pink and delicious. The garlic butter sauce will keep you safe from vampires for the rest of the year. The Works sauce has a very slight smokey flavour to it, so if you don't enjoy smokiness in your food, opt for the garlic butter sauce. We completely overindulged and had the chocolate lava cake and waffles for dessert. Highlights of the evening? The crab and the service we received from JJ, Greg and Ly. They were super attentive, friendly, and made great recommendations. We'll be back!
2
Had the duo pack with The Works sauce. When food arrived it was not piping hot, was not spicy either thou we had asked for medium spice. The Works gravy was Super salty, so salty that one could' take slurp the sauce off the corn n the rest of the food
5
Ambience was really nice, food was great. We had the Boilerâ€™s Bombdiggity Bag, which had a huge crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages and corn. Since we were celebrating a birthday we had a free lobster. We also had the spam fries, ribs. Fish n chips. Onion rings Etc. Servings were huge. Will definitely go back. Make reservations as it was very crowded

Located in the industrial area at Mcpherson area, it is not an attractive location. However the taste of thier seafood is delicious and service is casual and friendly. There aren't any table placemat, the signature food comes in seafood bags and you would enjoy it on the disposable wrapper covering the table. 3 of us finished a Boiler Bomb-diggity bag meant for 4 (S$149++) loaded with a huge brown crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages plus 4 buns on the side. They a few types of sauce and level of spiciness you could choose, we go for mild 'The Works' which is rather satisfying. On a separate day we came for the Ultimate burger which was average but the sambal seafood pasta was outstanding. Oh yes, they have cold beer, including Kronenbourg Blanc and 1664 Lager
4
Fresh seafood coupled with a bespoke range of wines - had a duo
pack paired with a bottle of white and red. Will definitely come back again!
5
If u will have time and cravings for western style of seafood this is the right place to go in Singapore.
5
Excellent seafood. Good value for $. Highly recommended! Good place to get together with friends and family. Thumbs up!
5
Food improved a lot compare to my last visit, service is good!
Had an enjoyable lunch n definitely will be back
5
The food was really good and the staffs very attentive. Seafood were are very fresh! Thank you for the awesomeness! :)
5
Had a great dining experience at The Boiler with my family. The seafood was fresh and the service was efficient.
3
Food was good. service was fast, do not have to wait too long for foods. however found a string of hair inside my drink, and they gladly give me a new one.
4
It's something unique, majority seafood meal. My family is happy with the food except would like to request more choice of food. The sausages can be excluded as it was too salty.
4
This was our 2nd visit. The first time we had one of the pastas which was excellent, but the Boilers Ultimate Burger was only average as the patty appeared not to be home made and beef texture too finely chopped. If you stick to the seafood you probably cannot go wrong. On our 2nd visit we arrived before opening hours, but no problem we were let in and waiting inside. The Malaysian lady server was excellent. This time we ordered the Boiler's Bombdiggity bag for four, served in a big plastic bag in the middle of the table. Good to be among friends when you eat this finger food, everthing was good, and the prawns and the whole big Dungeness Crab was delicious. For 'western' type seafood the Boiler is hard to beat. Highly Recommended

Went to The Boiler to celebrate some friends' birthday. Made reservations more than 3 weeks ahead as we had a large group (10 adults and 1 child). We ordered 3 bombdiggity bags (with dungeoness crab, mussels and clams), extra side orders for corn, sausages and bread. Each bag costs $145, which I thought is pricey given the quantity and quality of food. One reason why we chose this place was that they offer free lobster if you dine there on your birthday month. We had 3 April birthday babies and got 3 complimentary lobsters ($75 each). This is very attractive so suggest that you give this place a try during your birthday month. What was disappointing was the service. It was haphazard, we had to ask for water, napkins and gloves. The staff even suggested that we eat directly from the bag instead of pouring the food into the table because the food will get cold fast if we pour it out (?!). This totally takes away the experience and fun of eating. The table was also narrow so the sauce starting to flow quickly to the edge where we were seating. The seafood was fresh but the sauce is average. I think they added a lot of MSG in their food as halfway through, we started to feel very thirsty. Having tried same food at Crab in da Bag, I would not recommend The Bolier. I prefer Crab in da Bag for their food and sauce and their outlets are also more conveniently located. The staff service is also much better. Will I go back to The Boiler? No
4
Not my first time there ; family enjoyed it.
Great food. Prawns were very fresh and the other shellfishes were tasty as well.
4
Food is fresh and service is good. Pricing is a little high but is worth the try. Atmosphere is a bit noisy when crowded. Washing bay water flow is too small, parking is limited during peak hours. Will visit again for special occasions👍🏻
4
I have visited the restaurant a few times the food is fresh. The service is rather prompt. No complaints. Maybe good to have new dish of the month so that at least I wouldn't be tired of going back there due to lack of choice.
5
This was my second visit to The Boiler. Loved the atmosphere and the fresh tasty seafood bags. Service staff were friendly and fast.
5
Order the bomb digi bag and a free lobster for the birthday boy. Place was busy but service was outstanding. Food was delicious as usual.
4
Done my booking seamlessly via online app. Nice food and nice ambience, and with 1 for 1 beer promo. Thumbs up!
4
The food is definitely taste nicer than dancing crab. Price is reasonable as well. Beer is one for one during happy hour. We shall be definitely be back!
4
Standard fare: eat on oil-paper-top, but can request plastic plate; disposable bib; eat with hands; clear plastic for phone (very practical for those who can't eat without checking their phones, or taking pics- which you might want to do tho when food is served).Staff are pleasant and patient enough. They have a food concept of eat from a "cornucopia" plastic bag where you just dig in, and is ok if you're with family or close friends. Otherwise I'd be uncomfortable with others half-rinsing their fingers in the steamy, mildly spicy garlicky sauce every time they dig into the yummy mix of corn, shellfish, sausage, shrimp, etc. Make sure to order extra bread- it's a usual sight in SG restos- smooth small fried buns lightly crispy outside but soft inside. Beer was great. It washed away the finger-rinsing thoughts. And do try the sweet potato fries.It's a smallish quiet corner thing near Tai Seng station. Perfect for small or private gatherings. Chatter is low, with the occasional laughter from adjacent tables. Give me a like! :)Cheers
4
Seafood with a twist - comes in a bag if you take the standard bag for 2 or bag for 4. Service staff are friendly and engaged. Draft beer on promotion for a pint even on friday night. Good option for you're looking for a chang
5
The crab was full of roe and the meat was firm and juicy. Very easy to crack and comes off in chunks. Goes excellent with the sauce. Lobster and prawns were worth the wait. The only grouse if any is that the clams were not as large but overall experience was great! Sweet potato and spam fries were decent.
5
Great seafood that is fresh and delicious. The service is also good with sufficient attention provided. Highly recommended.
4
Food is great & tasty, good ambiance. Friendly staff.
A bit of a walk from the nearest mrt station...
4
Love its chicken waffle and fish and chips!!! Seafood quite fresh too! But none of the sauces makes me wanna try the bags again.
4
The birthday free lobster deal was value for money. The staff were helpful and prompt. Food was nice and fresh but portion a little small.
4
Go there to celebrate birthday and get a free lobster. Despite is free, but the lobster is big and tasty. Very satisfied!
3
Staff were friendly n responsive. Food was delivered rather quickly even though the restaurant was kinda packed. However, the food (the crab bag for 2 pax, spicy level2 sauce) was just mediocre. Crab was either overcooked or not very fresh as the flesh stuck to its shell. Prawns, clams n mussels were alright. The sausage was a bit tough n corn a lil too mushy. Overall, food can be improved.
5
I've always loved the seafood here, even my friends thought it was so much better than the other restaurants that serve seafood in a bag. The garlic butter is a classic and the works sauce in medium spicy is really good as well. Really wished they haven't taken the Momma's Potato Scoops off the menu though, that was one of my favourite sides.
4
Great seafood in a bag, where the table is your plate. You get a bib and and clear plastic bag to put your mobile phone in as soon as you sit down, which was an indication of how messy it was going to get, and felt like the restaurant was giving us permission to get as messy as we liked.Each week The Boiler has a special marinade that they steam the seafood in. The week we visited, the marinade/sauce was Tom Yum, it was delicious. Decor is modern and they have some tasty beer cocktails, but, the drinks menu could be extended as there are only limited options, all of which are derivatives of beer.Don't be put off by the address, it is in an industrial estate. Decor has a modern warehouse feel, lights are a bit bright, they could do with finding a dimmer switch. Great place for couples who are not shy with getting messy in front of each other, or informal dining for large group
4
As I was driving to the boiler, I was skeptical as the restaurant is located as a industrial area. To my surprise, the restaurant was spacious and well decorated. The seafood was fresh and the side dishes were appetizing. My only negative feedback is that the side dish and ala carte menu has too few options. Also, as it was my friend's birthday, we were entitled to a free lobster which was a plus point. Not the best lobster I have eaten but it was a nice gesture by the Boiler team. One of the waitress accidentally spilled my can of coke while she was clearing our table. They promptly replaced my drink with no questions asked. Lastly, we arranged for a birthday dessert, to which the staff was very accommodating to help to put a candle and surprise my friend. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience for the price we paid. Expect the bill to cost $70 ~ $90 per pax if you intend to eat to your heart's content

This was my second visit. Like my first, we encountered inexperienced wait staff who did not seem to know how to greet customers and how to respond to enquiries. We had the seasonal crab and prawns with The Works sauce. The sauce as spectacular as usual, as we're the prawns. But this time the crab was a huge disappointment -- a lot of the flesh was either really mushy and frankly quite unappealing. Thoroughly disappointed with the crab especially since I was entertaining out of town visitors and had raved about this place.
3
Food is mediocre. Service have to be more attentive. Asked for all round water a few times, came all round coffee instead.
5
Chilli crab combo was great , coupled with great service staff - Vanessa
Thank you and will come back :)
5
The seafood with their signature sauce is superb and the fee beerjito flavours that they have go well with the seafood. With birthday promo, the free lobster is extra value for money! 2 thumbs up 👍
4
My co worker's bday celebration and we decided to treat him to a nice lunch . Awesome choice & to top it off The Boiler had a birthday promo if free lobster for the birthday mth . ! Thank you !
3
The service provided is probably the only thing that is excellent. Taste and portions are not as good as expected
5
Fantastic seafood place. Crab, prawn, lobster, mussels and clams all cooked and served in a bag with sides. Fabulous ribs and fish and chips for non seafood eaters. Good selection of beers and plastic aprons for everyone! Need to book as it's always busy!! Good selection of puddings
4
Overall is great except:1.Aircon is too cold during evening.2. Pepper butter sauce that comes with lobster has a strange taste that turned us off. It was after the meal then my parents realised it could be from the urine of the lobster! Yuck!3. Please put in more sincere effort in food preparation given the price tag e.g. Remove the intestines of the prawns before they are cooked will be nice, so is draining the lobster's urine off
4
Consistent food over the past few times I visited. Although I hope that they can continue to have some colouring markers and paper, wider menu selection for kids. Booking time for dinner is extremely early from 5pm to 5.45pm. Not sure whether it is because the later slots are full already
2
Ambience is pleasant.Clean and bright.Serving of food is disorder.Main dish came, 3 dishes at once.Salad came 20mins late.About to start, no cutleries given.Rushing came and inadequate supply.Already mentioned sharing , no small plates given.Drinks almost finishing, only refill two and miss out one of us.Food are not warm, quite cool already for pasta,fish and chips.Indicated birthday month celebration, not attended to it
5
Third time back to The Boiler, this time to celebrate a birthday and enjoy Boiler's birthday month promotion. Food was fresh and good and am glad that food standards were maintained if not better than my previous visits. Was served by Gregory who was very warm, friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back again
3
Wil return to support them for their good service. The service staff was very polite and friendly. Well done.
5
Enjoyed it very much. I hope Chope will introduce some discount for this restaurant, similar to Wild Honey
3
Food was great and their staff and service were attentive! Had a great time with my friends! Would visit again!
4
Food was good and interesting way of dining with just bare hands.
Made reservations before hand but had to wait for ard 45mins for our table. The crew was very apologetic and offered us snacks / discount as a form of apology. :)
5
Our 5th time there and food remains amazing. Never disappoint us with the load of fresh seafood! The free lobster that was given to birthday babies was big.
4
First visit to The Boiler to celebrate wedding anniversary with my wife.The location is tucked at a corner of a building in an industrial estate. While it's not difficult to find if driving and there are ample parking spaces around, it will be quite a distance from the nearest MRT station.The restaurant is spacious and clean. We were greeted by the friendly staff who offered us recommendations of the food which we did not regret. We got the Duo Bag and we were given aprons so as not to get ourselves dirty as well as plastic covers for handphone so that we can still use our phone even when our hands are dirty. Very thoughtful.We chose The Wok sauce in medium spiciness. It's good although on the salty side. The portion is good for two. We also got the fried fish skin in salted egg yolk as well as their signature mocktails. Overall a pleasant dining experience. Do note that the restaurant can get busy and crowded so it may not be a good choice if one is looking for a cosy and quiet dining experience. May not be very suitable for children.Reservation is strongly recommended
4
The service staff were efficient and very polite. Prawns were really fresh and the Sri Lankan crab deal for just a top up of $8 was great value for money. Preferred the Sri Lankan crabs to the Dungeness crabs. Mild spicy sauce was really really spicy. The garlic butter was really yummy though. Overall happy with the experience and will visit this place again
5
There been couple of Creole restaurants in Singapore recently. As someone who tried original Creole/Cajun in the USA, I have to say The Boiler has some mean standards in par with those back home. Open concept, slightly off the grid place with great service staff. Would def. frequent each time I miss Creole
4
Despite its "off the beaten path" location, The Boiler makes a great impression taste-wise. In terms of service, it's been one of the friendliest and most customer-friendly experiences this reviewer has had in ages. There are few frills and everything boils down (pun fully intended) to really fresh seafood prepared in a way that enhances rather than disguises the natural sweetness of the food. I'd chosen Garlic Butter as the sauce for the Bombdiggity Bag because I feared spices might drown out the seafood, plus not everyone in the group was partial to spicy tastes.The clams and mussels were pretty good, as was the corn. I mean, you can't go far wrong with butter and corn anyway. However, what impressed most were the Dungeness crab and the prawns. Fresh, clean and sweet - they were the highlight of the seafood package. Having experienced another seafood platter along similar lines just the day before, I can honestly say The Boiler's version won the vote hands down!Succulent would be the keyword for any summary of the taste offered by the Bombdiggity Bag. Of course, that the birthday lobster was offered (dining in, the birthday lobster is free, I had to order takeaway at lunch time and the establishment kindly offered a 50% discount on the lobster) at a 50% discount was an added bonus. Again, another great experience for the tastebuds and a comforting one for the pocket. Of course, the additional Chicks and Waffles as well as Spam Fries tasted great as well. The former was mildly spicy and sweet with the waffles retaining the crisp taste despite it being devoured hours after lunch because everyone was completely stuffed after the Bombdiggity Bag was dealt with. The Spam Fries were surprisingly free from the oily sheen that tends to accompany all spam products. If one had to pick any flaws to talk about, it would be the fact that the buns accompanying the Bombdiggity Bag were a tad oily. Frankly, the whole experience made for a rare bright spot on a day when the announcement of the US election results caused gloom and doom everywhere. Truly rescued the day! Regrettably photos were not taken but when food's that good, why would you take photos and not dive into the taste
4
Went to the Boiler a couple of months ago when they had a special for the lobster. I was surprised when the seafood came out all mixed together in a plastic bag and there were no cutlery items to use. Just your bare hands. All in all, it was a nice experience and the food was very tasty with a cajun style seasoning
4
Food was great but abit pricey. Service was fast, place is easy to find, easy to park not too congested.
4
Brought some friends to try, They really love it. Nice food if you didn't mind the mess. Finger licking good though.
4
The garlic butter lobster was fresh and good. Overall experience was good, but because there were too many customers, we had to take the seats outside of the restaurant. There was incense to repel mosquitoes away but my girlfriend was still bitten.
4
Had one of the most enjoyable meals in recent memory. Great space and excellent crab and prawns with the works sauxe. Loved it. Couldn't get enough of the sauce and we had to order additional buns.
4
Cajun seafood is the trend of late, and The Boiler has been 1 of the places to go with a bunch of friends and stuff your face into huge bags of seafood.On the ground floor of an office building in an industrial area of the sort, The Boiler has the luxury of space with the high ceiling which is always impressive with full height glass windows. The Boiler was done into a set of large marquee lights sitting on a red brick wall. i always have a thing for marquee lights, so this is a winner.i came here to celebrate the husband's birthday because they have this on-going promotion of a free live lobster for birthday boys and girls (with every purchase of the large Bombgiggity Bag). It's a lovely gesture to get the celebratory mood going. We still went for the Bombgiggity Bag even though it was meant for 4 and had it cooked The Works to medium spiciness (there are 3 levels to choose from).The servers came to "set up" for our meal, they put on a bib on each of us, had a large sheet of wax/baking paper over the table (to contain the aftermath) and even a plastic sleeve for our mobile phones!! Don't worry, the touch screen still works even with the plastic sleeve over, so none of those crazy-slurping-up-all-the-sauce-and-licking-the-crab-shell moments will be missed.Our bag of shiokness came in a large plastic bag alike those the aquarium shoppers use if you buy five kois. It was quite amusing. After an attempt to eat with cutleries for 15mins, we eventually just went digging into the bag with our hands. You know, it's just the 2 of us anyway. The sauce had a good kick, but spicy food lovers like us might go up to level 3 next time we come.Overall it was a fun night monkeying around, and every other table in the restaurant shared the same sentiments. There were a lot of photo taking and laughter going on.i think the Bombgiggity Bag was worth it if you plan to bring a birthday boy or girl and get the complimentary lobster. Or else the quantity might not be enough for four without ordering other mains on the menu. The 2 of us managed it and could still go for more drinks and supper with our friends right after. Overall, a fun time together and i am sure all the photos circulating on Instagram and FB can testify to it as well

Went there last night to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. We ordered the Duo Bag and the content was really fresh. The garlic butter sauce was pretty good as well. Serving of the food was exceptionally fast including the sides of spam fries and molten lava cake for dessert. We were served by Vanessa and she was very attentive and friendly. She noted us looking mildly lost over the menu and came forward to make recommendations to us. She offered to help surprise my friend with the cake and that really made the whole experience a wonderful one. We noted that the rest of the crew were also very attentive to the diners and offered much warmth in the delivery of their service. Kudos to the place and the service crew! Thank you for a wonderful experience, will head back again soon
5
I decided to try out The Boiler for dinner after a friend's recommendation and yes I was left very impressed by this place. The Boiler's specialties such as their Bombiggity bag and live Boston lobsters, and their fresh crustaceans, are delicious they are the ultimate treat. Sauce rage from hot and medium however can be customized according to one's palate for spiciness, we were also impressed with the fish and chips the batter was light and crispy, the fish was well marinated and the fish just melted in our mouth. Soooo good. The service was excellent, even though the place was full, we will definitely be back to try the other dishes. With the wonderful ambience of friendly service and fresh seafood offerings, this new restaurant is highly recommended. I will be back

I celebrated my hubby's birthday with a feast of lobster and a Duo bag. Although they were having a promotion for a free lobster for the birthday boy/gal, we had to order the bigger seafood bag which will be too much for 2 pax. Therefore, it is advisable to come in a party of 4 to enjoy the offer. In the end, we just ordered a-la-carte order for the lobster. The Duo bag does not include crabs. It would be great if we could have both the lobster and crabs as I am not a mussel and clams lover. The works sauce and garlic butter sauce was tasty and go well with the seafood. They also had a 1 for 1 for beer which was great. We made a special order for a Mao Shan Wang durian cake in a jar and it was really average. Can skip it. It is located within an industrial estate so this is a destination venue/restaurant. Better to drive or get a cab. Online reservations are a breeze. Not a place to frequent but good for the once-in-a-while celebrations events. Enjoy
4
Hubby brought me here to try the Duo bag. Just right for 2 persons, we added buns (which were too small and pricey ) and wings. I honestly think the wings are just ok. The seafood mix was good and very fresh. The works sauce which we opted for in Medium spicy level was very good. Tasty and garlic bits in a rich buttery runny liquid. Served very quickly in a bag. No cutlery provided so be prepared to wash hands and get dirty. Good place for families too. Must book in advance to ensure a seat at the time you want.
4
Went with my family for my wife and youngest bro's birthdays, birthday celebrant gets a free boston lobster in the birthday month. 1-for-1 before 8pm for draft beers can choose between Kronenbourg Blanc and 1664 Lager. Around $15 for a pint.Seafood was good except for the lobster, our lobster was overcooked and the meat is rubbery tough. As we ordered 2 Bombdiggity Bag ($145 each bag), we tried their garlic butter and medium spicy sauce. Garlic sauce was better in my opinion. We also chose different sauces for the lobsters but it was not as good as the garlic sauce.Remember to order the Mao Shan Wang cake at the start of your meal to reserve it. It sells out real fast!!After dinner, we were given a free side return voucher for lunch. Good marketing! :) will consider coming back again with my associates! Total spending for 8pax was $475 (2bags, some sides, fish & chips and beers). Pretty reasonable
5
Been to similar restaurants but so far this is the best. Food was amazing and service excellent. The plastic cover for your mobile phone (in case you need to answer the phone or take a picture without washing your hands first) was a nice touch.
5
love the 1-for-1 deals! one of the best fish and chips, fresh seafood in garlic butter sauce which was a hit among my family. i always bring our families there and my brother has been back 3 times since. love the food and atmosphere
3
Second time back because the first was great! But this time we didn't get our aprons. how did you miss us out?
4
New experience to eat fresh seafood in the bag. Location is accessible (near tonTai Seng Mrt). Place is clean and cozy.
1
I'm sorry, I don't understand the high ratings given to this restaurant.
The most important thing about seafood is its freshness. The crabs, prawns and yabbies here tasted like they have been frozen for a while. Chewy, tasteless and greasy.
5
Good for group dates. Fresh seafood. Something about eating with bare hands that help to break down all ice and inhibition! In the industrial area but walkable from Tai Seng MRT.
5
The Boiler never disappoints, will always come back for the great items on the menu. Great place for any occasion.
5
A very happy meal filled with fresh seafood in two bags for the two birthday boys at the table! The promo of a free lobster per birthday boy meant we could enjoy a feast with two huge and fresh lobsters! What made the occasion even sweeter was the prompt and attentive service, led by Vanessa and team, who attended to us all the way and was patient with our requests. Thanks Boiler for an awesome time!
5
I made a reservation from Melbourne and also email Malcom he was very helpful answering all my questions . We got there the night of our dinner n the staff were friendly n helpful .We had the Bomb diggity Bag with garlic sauce n the Lobster in pepper sauce the sides were enough for four maybe the nacho cheese sauce could be a bit bigger but there was no trouble asking for more . All our drinks were lovely n refreshing the ice lemon tea ,lime freeze and old fashion lemonade . We will certainly recommend this restaurant to any Seafood lover . Well Done
4
A Must try is their signature sauce, OH also look out for their monthly promo on their Facebook page. There might be a $1 lobster for you. Tuck away from all the hustle of the city life, this place is located in the mists of industrial factories, It lets its taste attract the customers. First time I was there, their food made a deep impression. second time, a great memory was created. third time a great party happened. no whites clothing, scare to get your fingers dirty then go to MBS, this is the true Finger licking good. Singapore style. Those who like seafood should come here at least once in their life. REMEMBER SIGNATURE SUACE
5
Warm and comfortable place to eat and drink with friends! Signature dishes are absolutely finger-licking delicious! Pity it closes on 10.30pm on a Friday.
4
Great place for family dining! Many variety for adults as well as children. Wonderful experience dining with just using your fingers, no cutlery.
5
Food was good, the service, impeccable, was also impressed by the quality of their drinks, like the mock tails, and coffee!
4
Nice place for dinner catch up with friends or family. Location is quite accessible walking distance from circle line station. Place is crowded so do make a reservation. Ordered the duo bag Food portion just nice for 2 pax (we ain't big eater to start with) overall good!
4
Visited during birthday month and made a booking through HGW which gave us a free lobster (worth $75++) for every bombdiggity bag ($149++).We had the boston lobster in peppa butter sauce (creamy) and the bombdiggity bag in garlic butter sauce. Both tasted fantastic and the seafood was so fresh!Enjoyed my dinner very much thank you
5
Me and my boyfriend are on honeymoon and absolutely loved this restaurant. Great concept and great food. Really fresh good quality seafood. We had 2 beers, 2 sodas, sharing bag for 2, Siracha chilli fries, 4 extra fried buns (you will understand when you try them!!) and Molton lava cake to share 135 Singapore dollars Â£60 ish. Not the cheapest meal in Singapore by far but worth the money. The only downside was the location but we were 15 mins taxi both ways and got an uber for 18 sd:

 have visited with different friends & we've enjoyed ourselves each time. haven't been disappointed by the taste & freshness of the food. location is a little off the beaten path but don't let that deter you. It can become quite a pricey meal if u hv too many add ons. my friends & i tend to stick to the bags of goodness & their lovely lava cak

I never liked fish and chips till I came here for a visit. I ate fries and their fish, I hated fries and I like theirs.The spicy gigatic bag of seafood was amazing too. The corn, the fatty crab, its all cooked perfectly. Staff was amazing.This place is a hangout place not for tourists but for neighborhood. Its a hidden gem and I wish them all the success. Yes, I will visit them again when I came to singapore. For sure

We stepped in the restaurant with no reservation, however we were lucky to get a table on a weekday peak period. We were warmly greeted and taken to our table. Though a lot of the tables are reserved, they managed to squeeze us in and no complaints for that. :) The waiter were attentive and while the restaurant was quite busy, the atmosphere was homely. We truly love everything about The Boiler from the concept of their seafood spread, the ambience of the restaurant to the fast efficient and friendly service crew! Keep up the great work guys

Happy with our dinner spread at The Boiler. Certainly helps when they offer a free lobster for any order with a Bombdiggity Bag for anyone with birthday falling on the same month. Would be a fulfilling experience if they entertained my request of slicing one of the corn to a smaller width so that my baby of one year old can hold and bite into the corn. Turns out, we had to ask them again where they brought it into the kitchen to slice if for us.

This is definitely a place to visit together with your friends. Great food, great service and reasonable price.

The seafood is fresh. Prompt service. Thoughtful as they provided a plastic slot to protect our mobile phones from stains. Can still text or take photos even with oily fingers!

Prawns with sauce of the day; mussels with cream sauce; clams with chilly paste I think! Taste was really good with the fresh seafood. To top it all we had molten chocolate it wasso good!
5
Have been talking about The Boiler and finally we made it and never failed us. The food was awesome and you must try their fried fish skin and lava cake... The lava cake melt in your mouth and super rich.. Don't think anymore and head down and give a try

We went there during lunch and it's quite a surprise to see the crowd in an industrial area . I ordered the bbq spare ribs and think that's value for money. Saw down groups eating the seafood bag and looks quite yummy, will probably try it next round. Only area to improve is that the restaurant only serve beer and not wine.
4
We reserved in advance for a group of 6. The restaurant is fully packed on saturday despite the restaurant located in industrial area. We are seated only when everyone arrive as per reservation. The restaurant decor looks great!We ordered 1 X set for 4, 1 X set for 2, some side dishes and we got a lobster free as on going promotion for birthday month. we tried butter garlic, the wok (medium hot) and the source of the month (laksa habihiam) for our dishes and it tastes great! the seafood is fresh but the portion is not huge. Price is slightly at the higher side.Overall, the food is nice, the staff is helpful and the restaurant environment is good. Recommended for all

Its a memorable experience indeed. Who would have figured you will be served your seafood in a plastic bag? But despite the lack of finesse, the food is good, tasty and the restaurant style sure makes it feel natural to use your fingers to dig in. They have even prepared plastic cases for your mobile phones with the foresight that you fingers will be dripping with Louisiana Cajun styled crab, mussels, prawns, lobster..... They have other flavour options but I think original is best
4
Everything was fuss free. I made the reservation online, and the confirmation was done via sms. Reached the place on time, got seated very quickly.Seafood was served in a bag and we ate with our hands. No changing of plates, no finger bowls. Our duo bag in garlic & butter sauce was great. Liked the fish & chips too. End the dinner with a refreshing lime-mint freeze
4
I recently conducted two lunch meetings at the Boiler. The setting was good for conversation, and the food was very good. I was disappointed that on both of the days we selected during the week, the Boiler was not able to offer the salad item on their menu
4
Service was prompt, I liked that they provided bibs and even plastic sheets to protect your handphone as eating can get a little messy. It was a little noisy due to the number of groups there so if you're looking for a place to have a quiet dinner this might not be it. Our seafood bag came with a generous portion of clams and mussels. The garlic butter was not bad, the spicy seafood was indeed quite spicy! Order some mantous (buns) to dip into the sauces. Overall a good dining experience. Paid about $330 for 7 pax
4
Great value seafood spread with a good selection of craft beers and ciders.... Would recommend anyone to try it.......
Would love to see them include some fresh squid onto the menu though...
4
Was there to celebrate my dinner and realised the lobster offer. It was a good deal and the food is fantastic. Will be back again soon.

good food good servies what can u complaim... it will be even better if they can lower the price abit more!

It was not our first time trying seafood in a bag. However it was our first at the Broiler. The previous time (which was our first) was at The Dancing crab.Owing to the promotion of $1 lobster deal when you order the Bomdiggity bag ($145++), we decided to give the Broiler a try. Since I have tried both, my review will include some comparisons. I read review which mentioned that the Broiler's price is cheaper and more value for money because of the cheaper rental cost. I was a bit shocked when I see that the Bomdiggity bag was priced at $145++. It was meant for 4 persons, there was one crab, quite generous portion of prawns. There were a plentiful of mussels and clams though which were too much for our liking. The rest were sausages and corns. The price we paid for was $88++ at The dancing crab. Although it was meant for 2 pax, the ingredients were pretty much the same. In fact, they have added scallops which the Broiler doesn't. I kind of felt the portion was created for 4 at the Broiler because of the large quantity of clams and mussels. I didn't really like the muscles as they are really tiny. The clams used here are not the type I like (white clams were used at the dancing crab), the ones here did not have the natural sweet taste and tasted quite bland.The $1 lobster promo was indeed a good deal, and great marketing strategy. Otherwise I don't think I will pay for $75++ just for the additional lobster. I really like The works sauce (which is made of Cajun). We had the mild version on our Bombdigitty bag. Although it was recommended to have the lobster with garlic butter sauce, it didn't really wow me. It tasted more buttery than garlicky. Maybe that's the purpose in order to taste the original sweetness of the lobster. The lobster meat is fresh but we find it a bit rubbery. We tried the fish and chips as well. Unfortunately it failed to meet up. I think they tried to save cost by using dory fish. For good old traditional fish and chips, never never use dory fish. Its a mistake! It's marshy and doesn't taste even like real fish. Overall I would say it's still alright. The ambience, the waiting time (very short) for the food and we were out of the place within an hr!

I love the restaurant ambience and environment. Spacious, dim yellow light, lot of tables inside and outside table available for smokers. Good place for even just drinking. Very accessible location. Walkable distance from mrt. This time around I tried garlic butter seafood bag with friends. They have tried the spicy flavor and found it too spicy. I'm dying for strong taste seafood but, will come back next time.Crabs are big! Prawns are so fresh and big, lot of mussels, clams, and additional of sweet corns and black pepper sausages. If I have a spoon I would scoop the sauce to drink. Too bad you only can use your fingers to eat. You can ask for a spoon I guess, but I was shy. After all the good reviews, the most ungrateful thing to us that night was the non English speaking waitress. We don't recognize the accent, it took us a moment to put orders. Tiny fair little girl with glasses. She starring at us all time, it was not a friendly glares. I was still able to ignore her for awhile until she carries a baby chair dragging on the floor and hit my chair! I looked at her and she stare back and continue dragging until it scratches the wall! Obviously the wall already had old markings immediately I can relate her did that all the time! Hopefully the owner would read this and take some actions on this. She didn't apologize at all. Last bit of it, lava cake is awesome. Moist, spongy outside, good quality of chocolate lava inside. It goes super well with the ice cream. Hazelnut ice cream? :

Compared to the other eat off the table seafood places I have tried in SG, this has got to be the better one but it is slightly costlier too. The 3 of us had the the Boilers Bomb Diggity bag, sweet potato fries and Bacon shrimps with hickory BBQ sauce. The fries and bacon shrimps were great sides, especially with 1 jug of Kronenbourg blanc beer. The sauce that came with the seafood was nice when hot so eat it quickly. Staff was friendly and had the initiative to recommend all time favourites. It was a good experience dining at Boilers. I love the location although it is out of the way to those who do not drive
3
Taste of food is good but when you factor in the price, it does not gives you the wow experience. Given the same price, there are many seafood restaurant that can do better. The menu is limited and thus you won't have much choices if you are in a group of friends or a family. The choice of alcohol seems more than their main menu. Sides were pretty normal. Given my experience, don't think I will return to eat.

i've heard about The Boiler and was reccomended by my friends and despite loving Crab in da Bag, i gave Boiler a shot.Ambience and location was good as it was quiet.Service wise, staff lacked training and were unsure or seem unwilling to verify certain information like what were the desserts for the child meal, staff replied "ice cream", which prompted me to ask what flavors and she was stunned and I had to ask her to go confirm.Foodwise was a disappointment too. order the assorted bag for 2, corn was horrible, seemed uncooked and hard, prawns were ok, mussels and clams were so so, food wasnt as hot as i expected. ordered crayfish as well, i suppose there were more shells than meat, not the sort i expected from cze char stores. Kids meal was limited, fish n chips or chicken strips which were all deep fried. Fish n Co wins hands down any time for me. was full but unsatisfied meal. probably wont retur

Quiet location and easily accessible by public / private transport. Atmosphere was very lively which is best suited for hangouts with friends / family. Service was excellent and food was served very quickly after we placed the order. Although it is a little pricey ($145 for a bag of seafood with crabs, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, buns and corn) it was worth it. Portion was generously large and the set came with a free lobster as it was included with the birthday promotion.

My hubby and I celebrated our birthdays with our family there as there is a free lobster for all November born with every order of Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag (Dungeness/seasonal crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, corn & bun) enough for 4 persons. We ordered 2 and got 2 free lobsters. We also ordered 1 fries and 2 coleslaw and the food was enough for 8 adults. There's also dessert available and we ordered a rainbow cake. The waiter was nice enough to put a candle on it. Price is not cheap but everyone of us enjoyed the food. It is located at a corner of an industrial building. Parking lots are limited. We went on a Sunday evening and it was already crowded. However, the service was good, despite the crowd. We would visit again

Good Cajun food at a nice spaced out restaurant away from the busy McPherson Road. We had the signature dish - Bombiggity Bag for 4 pax, bread rolls, spicy wings, sweet potato, bacon shrimp with BBQ source, lemonade drinks.
5
Food is a little pricey, but everything was tasty. We ordered the fried chicken on waffles, lobster, prawns, with the cajun sauce and butter sauce. Def go for cajun.

Been wanting to try this since I first hear about it and especially when they had the $49 Lobster promo but have to miss it due to one reason or other. Finally manage to grab a chance to and quickly made a 5pm reservation with my wife. It was one of the best seafood dinner we ever had. And this coming from my wife whom wasn't a huge seafood fan as I am. We ordered the Duo Bag and a lobster each (at $55/each). Despite having the Garlic Butter sauce and mine was Pepper Butter, you can still taste the freshness and the succulent tender meat our ocean has to offer. The friendly and attentive service from the waiter certainly help made the dinning experience that much better. Thus I'm giving it a 5-star rating, which I hardly do. Certainly gonna be back for more. Gotta try it on your own to find out what all the hype is about!

Always pack so do not forget to make reservation before coming...Food is tasty and price is pretty reasonable. Service was good. Ambience is good with music but not too overpowering so chit-chatting is still possible. Good place to hang out or date...Love the corns
4
Service was good....crew were attentive even restaurant was pack.Food came fast but was'nt really hot/warm enough. Ordered the spicy version, not that spicy actually but abit to the oily side. I didnt even soak my buns in as dip cause i dont wanna be eating oil instead of sauces. Overall still alrite but there is always room for improvement i reckon. Do made reservation before visiting this restaurant as it is really crowded and almost all tables were reserved at any hour. Was there form 6,30pm -8plus on a Sat night and no walk-in was let in due to all tables booked. Of cause there is a Q for walk-in, if you can wait up

Understated eatery near the ubi factory area. the hip cafe atmosphere was a huge surprise for it's location. It was a Louisiana grilled seafood place4 of us had lunch and the fish and chips is definitely one of the best I had. Unfortunately the assorted seafood platter was only available for dinner. Will go back for tha

Hidden in a low-profile corner in Paya Lebar, this quiet gem was quite spectacular. During our first visit , we were taken aback by the absence of cutlery & dinner plates. The succulent seafood & prompt service won us over. Great music too. When we were leaving the restaurant, almost all the staff thanked us and said goodbye, plus remembered our names. Absolutely unusual in the local f&b scene. Great job

Celebrated wife's birthday (she's born on 9 Aug) at this place. First time visit and it was a very interesting experience. We ordered the BombDiggity Bag and a lobstor. Both were cooked in high quality thick transparent plastic bags. My daughters told us that the seafood is actually cooked in these bags in a water oven with the sauces into and then served straight to us. All the seafood in the bag (crab, prawns,clams,mussels) were super fresh and corn cobbs and sausages were added. We also ordered calamari, fries and the local fried "mantou" buns to dip into the sauce.Very good concept where there is no cultlery - no plates, spoons or fork. Just eat with your hands. We need to put on little plastic aprons to prevent out clothes from getting the accidental splatter and gravy dots when we eas the crab and lobsters. Lobster was fantatic and so were the rest of the seafood. The only "tool" we had was a nut cracker to help us with the lobster's pincers. For desserts, we tried the fried banana and durian fritters - no regrets here as it tasted great. Fresh durian was used and I think the restaurant managed to catch the tail end of the current durian season. Our daughters started to think about how to use the left over sauces in the 2 bags so as not to waste them. One way was to pour it over a plate of pasta, mix it well and enjoy a dish of seafood cajun or butter garlic pasta! But what we really was to use the empty mussle shells and scooped and slurped up all the sauces, after dipping and eating up the fried buns. The service was good and the staff was very friendly and responsive. Overall a very great meal and family time

its about the beers and the seafood that keeps yuppies coming back here. to try everything at a go, just order the BombDiggity bag. I opted for the Butter Garlic which is suitable for kids and adults. Ordered an extra lobster with the species level 3 sambal sauce which is spicy but still tolerable for singaporean tastebuds. Noisy and rowdy place, but great to unwind. Served in a plastic bag
5
Decided to try this place as there was a promotion for $1 Boston lobster (usually $75) with a purchase of the Bombdiggity bag (serves 4). I've tried Cajun seafood at Full of Crab before and The Boiler definitely beats it hands down. The best Cajun food I've tried was at a restaurant called Swamp in San Francisco but this place is almost as good. The Bombdiggity bag ($145) comes with crabs, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, 4 pieces of mantou and corn. We went for the garlic butter sauce as that's my favourite. For the Boston lobster, we went for The Works (mildly spicy option). The seafood is very fresh and tastes awesome. I enjoyed the prawns and lobster especially. The corn is so yummy in the garlic butter sauce. My wife had the lychee beerjito which she really enjoyed. Service was also very good. Will definitely head back there.

I love the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag which comes with almost everything in their seafood menu except for the crayfish and everything inside is fresh and you can taste the sweetness of the sea with every bite. They had made a mistake on confirming my reservations (marked me as arrived when I just turned up) but it was quickly rectified by the staff who got me a seat within minutes. Place is packed during dinner so advised to call in for reservations

Strange place for an anniversary, I know! We've been to cajun kings, and dancing crab. This time round, I ordered their signature bag with the crab @ $145 with a medium spicy sauce. The prawns were fantastic. The right freshness and texture. Well done. The mussels and clams were average and so was the corn. I could do without the sausages. How bout some squid?The crab was fine. Pretty much what you can get at the other 'crab diners'.The servers were polite and prompt but appeared tired and worn out. In comparison, the other 2 diners had chirpy staff who were more attentive.The unexpected 'find' of this place was the music. A medley of slow tunes, rock, new and old... but whoever did the music selection - well done! It worked. I was more impressed with the music selection than the food. Not sure if that is a good thing but my take on this place - go try it sometime and decide if it's for you. The music and the prawns were my favorite

I have been here for dinner several times, but not lunch. I was in the Macpherson area for a meeting and decided to pop in for lunch with my colleague. The lunch menu has meats, pastas which are different from their dinner menu. They also have small bites which are also available for dinner.We ordered:- Smoked Duck Pasta: This is the special for the day and not on the menu. There were generous pieces of smoked duck pieces cooked with linguine in a creamy sauce and sliced capsicum. Its nice!- The Boiler’s Ultimate Burger: Quarter Pounder with lettuce, tomato, onion rings and topped with an onion ring and homemade bacon jam with smoked hickory sauce. Cajun Fries on the side. The burger patty is thick and juicy. Iloved the onion rings and the bacon jam. Its yummy and finger licking good. The fries were also good, with the Cajun seasoning. Must try for beef and burger lovers! For drinks, I ordered the Boiler Lemonade, which is a favourite of mine. This has Vitagen in it. Good that I have my pro-biotics together with my refreshment!The food served at lunch is good value and nice. I will be back here again.Try it

This is my second visit to The Boiler. The dining menu remains the same. I was expecting new dishes though. Nonetheless, it would be nice to taste the duo bag with additional seafood items like crabs. I wouldn't mind paying a little extra with crabs or lobsters. The other option will be to let me choose the seafood that goes into the bag

This place is smack in the middle of an industrial estate, and there are really no other restaurants around the area. Given the lack of competition, The Boiler still does a really good job of maintaining certain standards.I was rather impressed by its ideas and concepts -- the practical plastic bibs, the paper-lined tabletops as your own "plate", the little clear plastic holders for your phone, and even the way the mish-mash of seafood is served in a huge plastic bag!Atmosphere of the place is great. The high ceilings of an old factory helps, I suppose, and service was reasonable, given how busy this place was at dinnertime on a Friday. Food was also fairly good. The fish and chips are listed as starters, but they really are sufficient for a main course. I guess it's meant to be shared, and hence. The "Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag" in its varying levels of spiciness smells awesome (I don't take spicy food, so I could only smell it) and the garlic butter one tastes awesome too, but only if you're a fan. Some of my friends found the garlic taste too strong, some found the butter taste too strong. Me, I loved it the way it was.Choices of dessert is really limited, and very much for people with a sweet tooth. The molten lava cake was really nice, but a tad bit too sweet for me, which meant it feels really heavy after about 2 bites.Overall, I would recommend this place if you love seafood and are looking for something special. Something that's not like a snobby sit-down place with plates, fork and knife. I had a fun, down-to-earth seafood evening at The Boiler

It's not common that you can legitimately make a mess of your table while eating, and pass food to your table-mate using bare hands and sans plates. My family and I enjoyed the fun experience of opening up large bags of food and mopping up sauce from the table. There's no glamorous way to eat at The Boiler -- not for first dates!Unfortunately, the bag of clams in pepper-butter sauce was gritty, sandy, and filled with shattered shell pieces -- very unpleasant to eat. The lobster (at a promotional price of $55++ each) had a leathery shell (was it supposed to be like that?), making it frustrating to crack open. The resulting meat was okay, nothing to shout about.I recommend eating at least once for the experience, then replicate it at home for a fraction of the cost

I had been wanting to make it to the Boiler since it opened but couldnt find friends willing to get to Mcpherson. ( I thought Singaporeans go anywhere for good food / newly introduced cuisine.So the 9th May is my first visit with two close friends ..Relatively easy to find, at the end of an industrial street , but who cares if the food is good,We barely waited 10 minutes before getting our booked table for 9 pm with the Manager constantly signalling when ours would be ready .(.good impression already.) We brought our own wine at $20 corkage ( reasonable) and sipped away whilst waiting for the fish and chip starter. The restaurant was full, ( good endorsement) , and mostly Singaporean , who love their spicy sea food.and in small Singapore I meet a long lost army friend there at the next table with his family....thanks to the Boiler !!!The starter size basket of 3 finger fish pieces and fries was adequate but I think the batter was a tad oily. The fries were fast food style , short and small ....they could have been chunkier.....passable but I have tasted better.My guests didnt want crab or lobster which was a pity but the bag of prawns , mussels and clams and corn was sufficient . The sauce at medium was spicy but not over-powering , good southern flavours of chipotle and pepper sauce. Comparison with chilli crab ? well the Southern spice taste is quite different ..as the chilli in that part of the world are not the same as the ones we get in South East Asia....I like it and its equally good..King size prawns were plentiful and crunchy , and mussels tasted fresh........a meal enjoyed by all.With the corkage our bill was $105/- with no alcohol, so I thought it was very reasonable for 3 ......Our waitress Bianca was humorous and obliging......and staff quite friendly.Whilst the bibs and hand-phone covers are a great idea, i think that finger bowls with lemon to remove the sea-smells from your fingers and paper towels would be the topping on a finger -licking good sea-food experience

My last meal here was some time ago and I came across this great promotion, where you can get a free lobster if you book online via hungrygowhere. The deal is that you have to book online, order The Boiler Bombiggity Bag and you will get a Free Boston Lobster!I rounded two colleagues and we came here for dinner.Eating here is unique, cos you eat with your hands and just throw the seafood shells on the table. They do provide the crab/ lobster cracker to help you crack through the shells of the crustaceans. The staff came to put on bibs/ aprons over your clothes to prevent accidental stains of your clothing while eating.We ordered The Boiler Lemonade, whch has a bottle of Vitagen in it. Its nice and refreshing. Here are the highlights of the meal:- Boiler’s Bombiggity Bag: This was a combo bag with all their seafood offerings. It had Dungeness (Brown) crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, corn and came with deep fried buns (Mantou).We had this done ‘The Works’ – Medium spicy. Its hot, and 5 minutes diving into the meal, I was perspiring. I could feel the sweat beads forming from the top of the head. The crabs were meaty and cut up so the gravy covers every available surface and makes the seafood flavourful. It’s fresh! Prawns were good-sized and also fresh. My friend loved it! Lots of clams and mussels in it too. - Whole Boston Lobster in Garlic Butter Sauce: The lobster was a decent sized and more than enough for the 3 of us to eat. The lobster was fresh and meaty. The garlic butter sauce was also good. - Southern Chicks & Waffles: We added this to your order, as my colleague had this before and she liked it. You get 4 quartered thin crispy waffles with a piece of deep-fried chicken breasts with a toothpick holding them together.Its drizzled with maple syrup. Given the name, I think it’s a dish from Southern America. Its good. The waffles are crispy and the chicken is moist and tender.It was a good meal, and we did have tasty fingers, after all dipping into the seafood and eating with our hands.Do go before the end of the month to enjoy this promotion!Recommended

This eatery reminds me of my days back in the States. The Boiler is aptly named. All ythe seafood is boiled cooked. You get to choose the flavour of your sauce and level of spiciness. Reminds me of another seafood joint called crabs in a bag. But The Boiler takes it up a few more notches. The Boiler serves lobster, prawns, shellfish, crabs on the menu, and a great localized beer, I cant remember the draught beer, but it goes down well with the seafood. Restaurant is located in the heart of an old industrial park in Macpherson, which is why i feel is quirky and reminds me of my days in the US where an eatery pops out of the strangest places in a sometimes unrelated neighborhood. Parking is ok - for those who like risks, you can park kerbside and hope the local revenue collecting traffic police dont give you a summon. Or you can park within the building. Dont order the lobster, tended to be overcooked and chewy. The crab, shellfish and prawns are good bet. Oh... best to go with a bunch of friends, because dinner for 2 is just too much

The good folks at The Boiler brought the Louisiana-style cuisine to Singapore. Tucked in the unlikely location of Macpherson (making it Singapore's best kept secret), this restaurant serves really authentic Louisiana cajun seafood boil with a slight tweak to suit the Singaporean tastebuds. The Works sauce is spicy yet not too overwhelming which brings out the freshness of the crabs and lobsters. I also enjoyed the Beerita, which is margarita but with beer, served with a bottle of upside down corona which is not only refreshing with the seafood, but also instagram worthy. Do pay a visit if your in for a fun and service-oriented seafood experience in Singapore
