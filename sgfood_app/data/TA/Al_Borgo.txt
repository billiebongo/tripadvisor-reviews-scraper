Really good food and an outstanding service oriented staff. They always treat us the way any dining guest would hope to be treated. Highly recommend!

I have been few times at Al Borgo and I always encountered professional service together with exquisite food .
5
Went for a quick late lunch with the wife yesterday, on the way to kids' PTM. We ordered the spaghetti cartoccio and gnocchi. The Cartoccio was excellent, with generous portions of mussels, clams, prawn and scallops, all super fresh. The gnocchi took a while longer, but was well worth the wait. It wa brought to our table piping hot, oozing cheese, just the way I like it. Will certainly be back soon
5
It has been a while since I have been back and we were very impressed with the service and they were incredibly sensitive to my children's "I am very hungry mom" comments and magically made a pizza appear within 5 min of us ordering. The quality of the food was very good and taste Yums.
5
I’ve been coming to Singapore for many many years, I know people who eat there 3 times a week. He has specials all the time. Best calamari I’ve ever had by far and definitely best pizza anywhere and pasta incredible, I did last night have pizza and calamari as a main course I had tuna, the tuna was not good, first time I had a dish I didn’t like, I highly highly recommend this place when your in town maybe stick to Italian dishes and it’s a family run Italian family a must to try but make Reservation FOR SURE.
5
Awesome food served with great service provided by the staff, especially Bhavin! We ordered their salad, speciality kobe beef, soups n pizza! Great food & experience overall! Drop by to feel and taste it
3
Better for small groups rather than birthday celebrations. Water tasted strange after refill. Don't think I'll be coming back here
4
Service was good and so were the pizzas. Used the entertainer to get 2 pizzas for the price of 1 which unfortunately is no longer available in 2018
5
Despite being busy, the service staff did a great job in ensuring we are well taken care of. Pasta, pizza was absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection and the overall dining experience left us asking for more! The ambience was great for families and friends gathering. their service staff remained friendly despite the peak timing. I would definitely return for more! Well done
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our italian dinner here. Great pizza and pasta of all kinds, good service too
5
Food was great, ambience was great. The service was a tad slow but that's alright. The pizzas were fragrant and pasta were nice.

Al Borgo @ Namly located at #03-00 41 Namly Avenue, newly opened branch out of town. This is a family restaurant which they managed to create a nice ambiance like in trattoria in Italy. It is a great place for casual dining and group gatherings, where families and friends can enjoy delectable food and drinks in a comfortable quiet and cosy setting.They also use Fresh ingredients from Italy. We had Pappardelle Al Cinghiale, Filetto di Manzo alla Brace, pastas, and Pizza Contadina followed by Tiramisu on that night, all were really tasty. The wine was also really good. The service was efficient, professional but not overwhelming. All in all we had a wonderful evening. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality authentic Italian cuisine. Iâ€™m sure we will come back very soon
3
The tiny restaurant was sorely lacking in wait staff. Even though the boss was helping out, we left after our mains because we never got our dessert menu despite asking for it. Looking at the portions of customers that were served around us, we though the portions were huge. As we informed the staff we would be using Entertainer, the portions were definitely smaller. We ordered the Angel hair and chilli crab pastas. The sauces were good and tasty, but something was missing with the pasta. Would I be coming back? Never.
5
We usually order pizza delivery from Al Borgo but decided to dine in today. Fantastic experience from the start - the staff are warm and friendly, they brought baby cutlery for my son without being asked and were engaging with him. We'll definitely be back!
5
Pizzas are usually the reason I visit Al Borgo and they now have another branch at 41 Namly Ave. The fact that its free parking and less crowded at Namly side makes it a nice location when you to chill with your family on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I highly recommend it. Service crew is very attentive and Chris the restaurant head is always smiley. MUST try is the Tiramis
5
It's very rare that you find such great quality food, wine and service at a reasonable price. Al Borgo ticked all boxes.We had the large anti pasto dish with the burrata between four of us.. it was huge! Definitely one of the best that I've ever had!Pizza was great, they even do a half half topping.All 3 pastas were incredible. The beef cheeks outstanding!Desserts were large and devine.Wine list was varied and very well priced. A great casual atmosphere made our experience even more enjoyable. Thank you
5
It's a casual dining place. Fantastic pizzas. Their specials are a must try. Reservations definitely recommended
5
I like the homely and warm feel of Al Borgo. The food is nice too. The mushroom salad is nice. The big platter is very filling and delicious, especially the melted cheese
4
My all time favorites are the pork chops cooked with olive oil done medium pink, dressed with a little balsamic, more olive oil with a dash of fresh lemon. And the tomato based seafood soup. Unpretentious place that is authentic serving good "home cooked" Italian food.Alan LeongSingapore
4
The service and the ambience of the restaurant was nice, conducive for couples and groups. The salad that we ordered was nice. However the Vongole was a bit too oily, making it a bit flavorless.
5
Thin crust, tastes excellent every time, quick service. We've been eating pizza here since we came and haven't found any other places that serve better pizza so far!
4
My 4th time in this restaurant trying something new. As always, taste and quality was always spot on.
4
Order AntiPasti Al Borgo (Mix cold cuts, burrata 125 gr, mix grilled vegetables and cherry tomatoes)Prosciutto & Funghi (Mozzarella cheese, ham and mushrooms)Cappellini Anduja e Gamberi (Angel hair served with prawns, Italian chilly sauce and cherry tomatoes)Clear clam soupAll are well serve and taste reallllly good
5
A favourite of the residents living around its neighbourhood, serves delicious food and the wines are also reasonably priced.The friendly chef will gladly whip up something that you crave for even if it's not on the menu (within reason, of course)
4
We have been coming here for the longest of time. Personal favorite was the prawn linguine which has this spicy sauce which I have difficulty describing. It's like a local chilli sauce but not overly spicy and never cloying. My wife loved the steak here but she usually takes it well done! In most places the steak will come out tough as leather but over here, it's still tender and charred. The accompanying potato and vegetable were delicious too. The pizza here used to have the cheese and ingredients sliding off the crust when you picked it up! But it has since improved and tasted delicious with its thin crust. We loved the black coffee here as it was robust and non acidic. But be prepared to be kept awake! Parking is free in the evening when you parked outside, subject to available lots.
5
My family celebrated my dad's birthday here and the king staff gave us a complimentary tiramisu cake, which was very delicious! The items on the menu had hits and misses
4
A cosy restaurant in a small building along Stevens Road with convenient parking in the basement. If we want to get away from the crowds in the city, this is a good choice.We had the antipasti special and the soups which were quite good. The fettuccine Kobe beef is quite delicious and we enjoyed the capellini too.We took the dessert sampling plate and particularly enjoyed the tiramisu
5
Their funghi risotto and pizza are a must try! Overall great experience and great food and highly recommended.
4
Lovely interior with unassuming style. Cosy for a romantic date or even bringing the little ones along. Very thin and delicious pizzas. Highly recommended
2
Our anniversary celebration turn out to be a disappointing experience! Very expensive for a small restaurant, quality of food is average, wine menu is way overpriced and the dessert was bad. Overall it has given us a over-commercialized feeling instead of what an italian restaurant should be
4
pasta came in a rather big serving. the chicken was excellent and so were the scallops in bisque. manager came by occasionally to check on us in terms of food, service was good. water was constantly refilled.
4
This is restaurant I like to visit at least once a month. All the food has been good so far, the service is good and the prices are reasonable.
Their calzone is fantastic!
3
Visited for dinner. The focaccia bread with herbs was excellent- loved the Flavours. Ordered pasta with prawns and another one with beef. Unfortunately they both were too salty which ruined the flavour.
Worth trying again and hope the salt is right the next time.
4
great italian food in a nice setting. we love the affogato, tiramisu and the calzone as well. however, service can be further improved though
4
Met a long time Friend for lunch at this very well located restaurant. Short walking distance from the Stevens MRT station. Food is good. Service staff were very friendly and helpful. As we did not want to over eat, we ordered 2 courses to share and they distributed into 2 portions for us. We also shared 1 dessert. Good place for lunch
5
We had the beef pizza and the seafood pasta in the bag. Both were delicious and left us craving for more. The service was excellent with a very patient staff member. We will definately return for another visit
5
Really delicious food.Enjoyed the ambience. Also enjoyed the food.Brought my mother for mother's day. she really enjoyed it
4
Was greeted by the friendly staff and service was very prompt. Food was great, especially the pizzas but unfortunately they ran out of vongole when i wanted to order their pasta. But overall, still a great place to visit and portions are good for sharing if ordering both pasta and pizza
5
I appreciate I am local but this is still one of the best Italians in Singapore. The staff are amazing and the head waiter makes you feel very special, always helping with selections. The Chef and his team offer you excellent home cooked Italian food with specials on regularly. Can't rate this place enough for the food, service and ambience. A real gem in Singapore.
3
Set in an atas neighborhood with well-decor Italian feel dining experience. Ordered mushroom and seafood soup for starters which were both delicious and came in huge portions which were able to satiate our palates quickly however too overwhelming after awhile. Pasta and ingredients were fresh too but however might be too salty for my tastebuds (personal preference). Overall a not bad experience if you like to dine in a posh italian restaurant but not very memorable too.
5
As the title. Nice ambience good food. Authentic Italian restaurant. Easy parking. Friendly waiters.
4
This place has a cosy atmosphere with good food. It was my second time there and the food doesn't disappoint.
4
Short walk from Stevens mrt. Service was fast. Food was good. Had seafood spaghetti in paper wrap and beef pizza.
5
Food is very good!! We had 2 pasta and 2 pizza. They were all good! Service was great and they serve free water, which is something I appreciate nowadays. Not only that, they had complimentary bread too. Highly recommended place!!!
4
We enjoyed the squid ink seafood pasta and carbonara. Service was fast and staff members were generally attentive. Excellent quality of food. Complimentary bread was a nice touch! We deducted a point because they didn't have options for low-fat milk for the coffee... Only full fat
3
We had a nice dinner at Al Borgo. We ordered a rocket salad starter with parma ham, cheese and truffle oil. The amount of parma ham was rather little. We also had a pizza and 2 pastas and a risotto. The seafood risotto was good value with loads of meat (mussels, prawns, clams and cuttlefish). Overall satisfying meal. The bill came to $131 but only because we redeemed a one for one deal from Entertainer App
4
My bf and i decided to spend our anniversary date at Al Borgo. We were intially a little disappointed by the service from one of their server who seemed disinterested and appeared slightly condescending when we didn't want to order the $75 t bone, and just ordered mains with no drinks. I also requested for a small plate for the olive oil which never arrived. However just as we were about to say we won't come back again, the floor manager came with apologies for the long wait for the mains as their kitchen was down and presented us with bruchetta on the house! A lovely touch which was very much appreciated. Throughout the evening he made sure we were comfortable, even turning off the air conditioning for me as I was feeling cold. Thank you for the great service and for saving our anniversary date from being a disappointing one. A lovely place to come for a date for for families.
5
A small and cozy Italian restaurant that serves near authentic italian fare in Singapore. Love its unpretentious decor and kitchen that is behind a glass wall. Italian staff were very polite and walked us to our table.Food served was beautifully presented and tasted really good. My seafood spaghetti wrapped in paper was one of the best that i have tasted in a very long time.My true test of an authentic italian restaurant is usually with the Tiramisu. Let me tell you Al Borgo serves a mean Tiramisu. Wonderful dinner with friends and cant wait to come back again
4
From the moment you arrive you a treated superbly, made to feel welcome with very attentive service from all the staff. Good variety of choice on the menu. Food is beautifully prepared to your taste (so if you don't want garlic don't be afraid to say) and presented well. Desserts do not disappoint. Would certainly visit agai
4
Homely and cosy cafe that serves good authenic Italian food. We tried their dishes with chef recommendations, including a mushroom salad, seafood spaghetti and beef pizza. For dessert the lava cake with ice cream is good choice.Excellent service too
4
A party of 8, place is bit cramped, but a good place to catch-up. The food has the basis of good Italian food, order thec bistecca and risotto and pizza, and an antipasta
4
A hidden gem, just chanced upon it. Great Italian food quality and selection coupled with superb service. Difficult to find a fault.
4
A cozy and authentic Italian restaurant. Both Executive Chef and Restaurant Manager are very attentive and friendly. They gave suggestions to pair your meal and drinks together, explained the ingredients to you and will ask for feedback. Celebrated my Husband's birthday there, and the birthday lava cake is so unique and memorable - sparkle and fire - ! Food was great and fairly priced. Will definitely come back again to try their Pizza. Bravo

We came here for lunch on a Sunday. We had previously eaten at this restaurant fairly often until about three years ago, and I do not usually write about restaurants in Singapore on TA unless they are exceptionally good (or bad).We went with the specials personally recommended by the chef: amongst them the 750g bistecca alla fiorentina, rare, for two. My wife noticed that the meat texture was slightly mushy and concluded that it was not the freshest meat. Most of the meat smelt fine except for the texture. It was only when I tried a piece that was sliced from closer to the bone that I noticed a fishy odor- think bait shop/ wet market fishy, not the briny smell of the ocean. I then cut the rare meat still attached to the T-bone and this resulted in a strong fishy odor emanating from that part of the meat, which all three of us at the table caught a whiff of immediately -- the unmistakeable smell of putrefying meat. Needless to say, that was enough to bring our meal to an abrupt halt.I discretely and politely informed the chef of this as he was passing my table. He took the plate away with him behind the bar counter to take a whiff of the piece in question, and returned to our table to pronounce that the meat was fine, it was 'only the smell of blood', which can be very strong in this type of meat. I wanted to point out that I have never come across bistecca alla fiorentina smelling like that in Italy (or anywhere else in the world for that matter), nor should beef ever smell of rotting fish, but I had a feeling it would be pointless. So, not wanting to make a fuss in public and spoil our weekend, I immediately settled the bill and left the restaurant. Only after examining the bill later did I find that I had been charged $128 for "wagyu" T-bone, as opposed to the ''regular" bistecca alla fiorentina on the menu at $75.I am quite certain that what I had just been served was not wagyu, freshness (or lack thereof) notwithstanding. I will not quibble about that, after all I cannot claim to be a chef or food expert.But as a medical doctor of some 25 years, I AM in a position to say what the smell of putrefaction is.It is the audacity of serving me meat that has gone bad, telling me it is fine, AND charging me a premium for it, that compels me to write this review. I wish now I had doggy bagged it and sent it in to the food hygiene people for a second opinion.Outrageous
5
My first visit to Al Borgo at Alocassia (they moved from Sixth Avenue vicinity a while ago) & it did not disappoint. We tried the mussels soup - highly recommended as the mussels had just arrived - small tender juicy - slight spiciness in the soup too. We tried the clams as well - also highly recommended. We shared a salad which was gone in a flash. And a pizza - thin crust topped with homemade sausages. Ending with tiramisu and affogato & capuccino. A very satisfying delicious weekday lunch
5
Its run by a great team of people and its got great Italian food. I had dinner there with a friend and we had a very filling meal. Good portions and excellent recommendations
4
I had dinner once and enjoy the meals plus the bottle.Staff is friendly but the service little slow.I would recommend this resto for couple only
4
Small yet cosy; fine yet not overly posh. Food was great, service was wonderful. Recommended for couples and famil
5
I ordered pizza via Deliveroo. It was a delicious pancetta and parmigiana pizza with truffle oil and tasted like it just came out of the oven when it arrived. Can't wait to try the other dishes
5
The service in this restaurant is second to none and the food is outstanding, served n a cosy ambience to an international clientele. The pasta is cooked to order so if you want it without garlic, that is no problem or you want extra Chilli peppers, just ask. When fresh lobster was on the specials menu we were recommended linguine with cherry tomatoes and herbs in a white wine and cream sauce to accompany it. Absolutely delicious. I am always spoilt for choice. There is an extensive wine list and a range of beers. It is a three minute walk from Stevens MRT. Don't miss out
3
I had a margarita with added ham and while good I thought the overall flavor was a bit bland. I much prefer a richer tomato sauce, something I can taste. Sadly, yours I could not. Otherwise the experience was pleasant.
4
Great local Italian. Good to find something of good value and without the over the top flare of other places
5
Dinner with friends! Service first and foremost was attentive. Our table was ready and we were promptly seated with our menus! We had the caprese and mushroom salad for starters and both were fresh and v.good. For mains we all had pizza, with one person having a risotto. The pizza was outstanding and the dough is the giveaway. This was a light pizza with good quality toppings, which is how a pizza should be! Will return
5
This was our first visit and we're so glad to of found this restaurant.We arrived at 5.15pm but the waiter was very kind and let us in early.There is seats outside and inside.The food was delicious and the service was really good.We will certainly return
5
We have been dining at Al Borgo for a long time. We are always pleasantly surprised by their friendly service and good quality food. Al Borgo offers plenty of choice for vegetarians. Also, it is reasonably priced for an authentic Italian family restaurant
5
Loved the Ravioli. The cream sauce is very delicious. The salad is also very nice. Yet to try the pizza but heard it's very nice as well
5
Friendly and attentive service crew and great authentic Italian food. Parking lots are limited. Ambience average.
4
Enjoyed our visit alot. Good atmosphere and very friendly service minded staff. They took their time answering our questions about the dishes under consideration and came with well aimed recomomdations. Food had great flavour, tasted authentic and compmemented the staff and environment in a good way. Staff and service level very good, food good
4
Came here for my bd gathering and we had a nice private side of the restaurant set aside for us. We dint realise we were hanging around till 30 mins past their closing time. Not only did they not inform us (or throw us out) but they jus patiently waited till we were done. Of cos after we realised we upped and left immediately. Kudos to their service! Food was also good.
4
@thekuoknowsThey say that good things come in small packages. Al Borgo fits that saying to a tee. It might not be built to cater for many diners at a single sitting but it still packs a mighty punch, especially when it comes to making authentic pizzas. Because it is small, do remember to book.The Italian eaterie, which is housed on the ground floor of a block of self-serviced apartments, certainly knows how to bake pizzas the proper way - thin and crispy and full of flavour.Its pasta, which is always the litmus-test of a good Italian restaurant, is as close to perfection on a plate that you will find anywhere. The Bolognese ragu caresses every strand of spaghetti with the gentleness that a traditional pasta deserves.After a few slices of flatbread and a generous helping of Italiannoodles, there was not much room for anything else. Perhaps next time I will have to be more measured at the outset. But the pizzas are very hard to resist
4
Service was attentive with a good selection of food. Standard of food was pretty good but prices tend to be on the higher side.
2
This place is expensive, the food is way below average, the service is disinterested and desultory. Overall a pretty poor experience.
5
Great food overall, dessert included. Had the calamari, black ink squid pasta, parma ham pizza, grilled lamb chops and 750g steak - all of which were excellent. Service was prompt and attentive. Definitely looking forward to my next visit!
4
Beef and Tiramisu very much ♥ The beef is so fresh and juicy, the Tiramisu is so authentic and rich. Definitely I will come back again :D
2
First of all place its quite dirty, waitress lazy and arrogant.Dishes not too bad but not straight italian.Finally the prices are overcharged for quality they give.
4
Great staff and a nice meal, only thing was the steak was too salty, I think it was seasoned with rock salt and it was to much for my taste.
5
We visited the restaurant on 13 Nov. It was clean and welcoming. The all male staff were well groomed and ready with a smile. I asked for recommendations and ordered based on their recommendations. We were not disappointed. Every dish was savoured till the last morsel. Their vegetarian selection was really good. The waiters were always hovering around and yet not intrusive. They topped the water glass without being asked to and cleared the dishes as we went along. A truly pleasant experience.
4
Very nice service. Waived the corkage fee as we bought also bottle of white. Good beef florentina , good pasta and the anti pasti were fresh. Good atmosphere. You can see the kitchen from most parts of the restaurant. It is an easy going, simple fares Italian restaurant .
5
I had the seafood pasta wrapped in paper with white wine, it was delicious! quite a big portion for a girl though, haha. The steak my hubby had was tender and juicy, so nice! Love the salad as well. Favorite? It'll absolutely goes to the Tiramisu!!! I can't stop eating even though I'm very full. Highly recommend this authentic Italian restaurant :
4
A very cosy & homely Italian restaurant. The staff were very accommodating especially when I was organising a party and my guests were very pleased with both the quality of food and the service. The Chef's recommendation was very well thought of. Try their special Homemade Chilli & Prawn Pasta (just right and made the Italian way... not too spicy!)
5
The food and the staff alwais perfect
Original made in italy.
You must try the kobe beef grill
angel hair whit italian chily sause and prawns
The best tiramisu
4
Such a cute little neighborhood restaurant. Small and cosy but beautifully laid out. Excellent waiting service. We had a baby with us and was apprehensive at the start but the staff did a good job of keeping him occupied. Food was very good, we had chicken pizza and prawn pizza- both well made and enough for four to share. Well worth a visit
1
Unfortunately we had a bad take out experience. Last night the pizza Parma was cold, overfull with ham, no tomatoes and ONE basil leaf! The two pasta dishes were mediocre at best. No love put into the preperation of this meal. And the price was extortionate for three small dishes. I shall never visit again
4
Ate dinner here on Sunday evening and the main dining area was full so we ate in the smaller back room which was half-full. Didn't realize this small seating area was here the first time we visited. There are also tables outside but our kids wanted to eat inside. This was our second visit to the establishment; friends of ours introduced us to this restaurant a few months ago. The staff was willing to accommodate our 8-year-old son who is allergic to egg, dairy and nuts by preparing a classic dish of spaghetti with marinara sauce (their spaghetti pasta is egg-free, but we were told not all the types of pasta offered are egg-free). The bread served was also safe for our son which made him happy. On both visits we have tried different pizzas which have been excellent. Their pasta dishes have been good as well. As for appetizers we have tried the bruschetta and mixed salads previously. The good food and the welcoming staff make this a restaurant we are glad to visit again

Kids' enrichment class is at YMCA Steven road nearby, so we always have our lunch at Alocassia. This was our first visit to this restaurant with bright yellow wall, and country deco (plants hanging from ceiling, racks of wines displayed on walls). Saturday noon and we're the second table. The friendly host was quick in warming up with my kids, showing them the way to use the 2-in-1 olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette bottle, and recommended a few dishes. Warm water and yummy warm bread were quickly served after he realised that my 'super skinny' boy was feeling chilly. We ordered the recommended daily chef's special (crabmeat pasta in pink brandy sauce), one mushroom soup and a smoked salmon pizza. We loved the bread, good on its own and heavenly with olive oil and vinaigrette. The mushroom soup was 'home-cooked' good. Al dente linguine in rich, very rich sauce which was not really pink but pinkish red was yummy; and true to what the host said, the 'alcohol' had evaporated. A refreshing change from the usual. The pizza, how should I put it, was out of this world. We had a lot of good pizzas(including the dessert pizza) at Lygon Street, not long ago when we're at Melbourne, but this one was equally good if not better. It's crust was table wafer thin, crisp warm contrasting with the soft cooler topping-generous serving of cheese, salmon and arugula, sensational. Excellent food but we're short of time as we needed to rush to the class, we didn't finish the pizza, the host packed it personally for us. With the carbs so good, the dessert shouldn't be wrong, we will be back..
4
Very nice restaurant! Authentic Italian food, a lot of different options in the menu. Nice atmosphere and welcoming staff. Kitchen has a see through wall/window and looks very organised and clean! A bit pricey so we usually go for a special occasion – but makes sense as it’s authentic western food in Asia. You get what you pay for though. Would highly recommend it
4
We had a late dinner there, sat on the terrace hence we had to wait a little bit every time for service, but other than that the experience was great. The parma pizza had parma ham covering the whole pizza, which was great, and the tomatoes were succulent. My wife's pasta was also very good. Definitely one of the best Italian places I've been to in Singapore. We live nearby so we'll be back with friends for sure
5
What a pleasant surprise. And its literally on our doorstep.Having just moved into the area, we are thrilled to have this little restaurant around the corner. What a lovely bunch. Every member of staff turned to say hello to us as we turned up. This has not happened once since we have been in Singapore. The level of service is non existent at most places so when you actually get service it is such a delight. Our lovely italian server chatted to us but also knew when it was time to let us chat amongst ourselves. GENIUS!!!!Fabulous pizzas, and so quick. The table next to us ordered the lobster pasta which was $82 and a special. We thought this seemed $$$$ but when it arrived at the table, it was a platter that would easily serve two hungry men, or four girls out to lunch. I hope its still on menu when my mother visits next month. Hint hint!!! And the people at the next table were totally cool and lovely. And we had a great chat to them. The totally gorgeous woman at the table said, "...dont judge us..." due to the huge amount of food they ordered. And we didn't. Half their luck, we wished we had ordered more!!! If only they delivered. They do takeaway. I want a pizza NOW!!!!The only negative is the price of wine. But thats Singapore! Also, a rose would be nice on the menu. Not sure if they do corkage.This is one of the few times I've felt moved to write a review, but you need to go there. Please be aware that though I've talked it up, its not silver service, Its a neighbourhood trattoria. It just happens to be a very good one. With excellent service. Id be quite happy to go there for a date, or with the family.ps In Australia, I owned a restaurant that specialised in pizzas. And I was also the chef
5
We've been going to this restaurant ever since we moved to Singapore five years ago - Mimmo and his team are more like friends these days and I think we eat here probably at least once every two weeks. The food is very reliable reasonably priced home cooked Italian fare - good range of pasta dishes with good portions, nice crisp pizzas and really nice grilled meats. Specials can be on the pricey side but some are worth every penny - lobster linguine is a personal favourite, who says it's for two people??? It helps that this place is only 5 mins walk from our front door but we'll keep going here even if we eventually move elsewhere - a welcome home away from hom
4
Al Borgo from a child's point of view:The menu had many options, which was brilliant for a fussy eater like myself. The restaurant had very friendly staff, both the waiters, and the chefs. The price was fairly low considering we had starters and mains, of which were all top quality.A recommendation of mine would be to order the "Fiorentina steak" and share it with someone. Absolutely delicious. Order an extra side of potatoes as it doesn't come with a sufficient amount.One criticism is that it's rather difficult to find the restroom. However, apart from this, it makes for a lovely night out.
5
It's a surprise for us on Sunday night: very pleasant dinner experience! delicate food, nice service and good wine. Totally worth the price. Will definitely recommend to my friends and come back :-)
4
You will feel like to be in Italy with a warm atmosphere.
A real Italian Chef in kitchen
We had a simple but very good dishes.
I recommend the pasta and la grigliata di pesce
4
Our group of 17 had a great time in our own cozy corner . Staff were attentive and accommodating . Food choice was wide and good. Food tasted very good and portions are generous and tasty . Worth a visit !
5
We used Trip Advisor and chose an Italian near our hotel (Shangri La). Turned out to be absolutely great, with a brilliant maÃ®tre d - he reminded us of a young Al Pacino, gave a range of very good and genuine food & wine recommendations, and best of all had worked in Leeds for three years, so understood our Northern English ways - including offering us a recommendation for the 'best fish and chip shop in Singapore'.The food was excellent - trattoria style rather than 'fine dining' - delicious starters (particular recommendation for the eggplant parmigiana ) and great starters: two good pasta dishes, and two of us shared the bifstecca Fiorentina, which was also really good. Didn't try the pizza but that also has a great reputation. Pleasantly surprised by the bill, which seemed very reasonable.Three days into a three year assignment here, and I suspect Al Borgo may just have earned an early slot as a family favourite.
4
Enjoy going to Al Borgo everytime.They serve tasty food and have prompt service.Personal favourite is the vegetarian Rissotto, portobello mushrooms and Raviolli.Must try their chocolate cake in the desert.Recommend to make reservations prior to going as they have limited seating space.A bit on the expensive side with approx charge per person expected to be around SGD 35+
4
My husband and I have been patronizing Al Borgo for years. We love how it's never too crowded, but serves delicious pasta, pizza and affordable wines. The special menu also never fails to disappoint. The service had always been attentive and the staff personable. We recently went with a larger party of people (6<) and unfortunately there were several lapses in service. From forgetting our orders, not being prompt with replacing dish-ware, silverware and topping up water, to getting the bill wrong. They probably don't get larger parties too often, hence the lack of experience, but it was a let down, especially since the food was still great! (And it wasn't because they had any new staff.) We'll definitely keep coming back. We just won't be having anymore large gatherings here.

We are very regular with friends and alone at Al Borgo. Before I's a cozy restaurant with fantastic food and great service. You can sit in or outside. For the weekend it's better to make a reservation if you like to sit inside. They serve very delicious Grilled meat, seafood, as well as the best pizza in town. Service is great. Give them a try. I'm sure you will love it too

Just celebrated my son's 21st birthday at Al Borgo. I have found a cosy home-run authentic Italian restaurant that does not dig deep into your pockets. Food was very good. Excellent service. The owner make sure that everything went well and we are happy with the food and service. They even played the birthday song which make my grownup son totally shy .. :). I would definitely recommend the pan-fried beef antipasta, risotto, ravioli and of course the black ink squid pasta. My group has given a thumbs up to this place

We are very regular at Al Borgo. Before I wrote this review, I was hesitating, since I was afraid that once too many people discover this cozy restaurant with fantastic food and great service, we might have difficulty in getting a table for our future visits :) They serve very delicious Grilled meat, seafood, as well as the best pizza in town. Service is great. Give it a try. I'm sure you will love it too

We've always enjoyed dining at this neighborhood Italian restaurant which serves excellent food in a nice and friendly setting. This was no different when we had dinner there just yesterday until a couple walked in and started to help out with the cashier and attending to customers. We later found out that they are the new owners of this restaurant. It was perhaps their eagerness to "run" the place that somehow seem to disrupt the flow and rhythm of the kitchen and service staff the moment they engaged themselves - their service did not come across as being professional and at some point, we may have even seen a 10 year old girl (probably a family member) walking in and out of the kitchen! We've always loved this place for the high quality food, the service and the professionalism. We usually stick to the pastas and pizzas and sometimes, the home made sausages, which are all excellent. The chef and most of the service staff are still there notwithstanding the change in ownership and this is what we would go back for, unless the experience that we used to enjoy is lost thru this transformation. A four star rating for now because we still enjoyed the food and the wine, and hopefully this stays

As Italian living in Singapore I have to say that our dinner was really amazing!
I really recommend this restaurant. You can also find a very good choice of italian wines (not the ones that you'll tipically find in italian rests in Singa).
Recommended!

Have been dining here occasionally since arriving in Singapore. Run by the owners (rare in Singapore these days) and the service shows. Friendly with well cooked food and delicious pizzas.

We live round the corner from this cosy Italian restaurant and often eat here with our kids. Great fried calamari, prosciutto fungi pizza!! Pasta porcini gamberi is also excellent. Desserts are great too. Service is very friendly and attentive!!

Excellent service! They really treat you well at Al Borgo.
We love their pizzas. Aside from Pizzeria Mozza, this is my favorite pizza in Singapore. The pizza with the sausage is so good. We also had a steak there one time and it was great.

We have been regular patrons to this Italian family restaurant since we discovered it about one year ago. The Restaurant has recently changed ownership and it is undergoing some transformation but Southern Italian chef Mimmo (from Naples area, experience in Italy and Europe before moving to Singapore), continuing on his place in the kitchen, is insuring continuity of operation.Cuisine at Al Borgo is as close as it gets in Singapore restaurant scene to authentic, genuine Italian cooking. Menu is extensive, with large choices of appetizers, pasta, pizza, main courses, and so are the daily specials, usually compiled with fresh imports available from Italy. Grilled meats are the specialty of the house, with the signature dish Bistecca alla Fiorentina (charcoal grilled T-bone steak) not to be missed by steak lovers. We have also tried over time a number of pasta, gnocchi and risotto dishes, all noteworthy. Pizza is probably just half a step below best pizzas in Singapore (Chef Mimmo pays toll to the lack a wooden-fire oven) but is still excellent in the whole. At dessert, skip tiramisu and focus on other home-made hard-to-find Italian cakes such as Diplomatico or Zuccotto.As with typical Italian family restaurants, ambiance is casual, portions are generous and service is friendly. If you want some tweaks to your order, Chef Mimmo will accommodate it to your taste. Prices are reasonable per Singapore standards for a restaurant in its category.Al Borgo is an excellent authentic Italian family restaurant to the point it would be a good restaurant in Italy as well. Those used to American-Italian or International-Italian cuisine might get a little disappointed as they might not find their favorite dishes or flavors, to those looking for a genuine Italian dining experience we feel highly recommending it

Had family dinner here last night for daughters birthday. They brought a nice slice of cake with a candle as a surprise. Food is excellent, best pizzas in town.My steak nearly killed me due to its size and tastiness. Everybody happy. Wine is good value by the bottle - and the wines by the glass are superb too.Very welcoming staff.Thanks Al Borgo

We have been dining at this Italian restaurant for several years now since they relocated to this location, and the food never fails to impress and satisfy us. Situated on the ground floor of the Alocassia Apartments along Bukit Timah Road, this truly authentic Italian restaurant attracts even Italians to dine there. The restaurant has been renovated recently with fresh wall decorations of mounted wine bottles giving a homely, rustic and cozy ambiance. The service is attentive, friendly and fast. Food prices are reasonable, and there’s an adequate wine list and a small bar. You can either sit indoors where it’s air-conditioned, or outdoors with the smokers! The kitchen is visible through a huge glass window that separates this from the main dining room, so that you can actually watch your food being prepared!We’ve tried many of the dishes offered here, and of particular note are favorites like the deep fried calamari, the portobello mushrooms with pesto sauce, the squib-ink ravioli pasta, the pappardelle pasta with wild boar sauce, and their mixed salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing. Of their ‘must haves’ are their freshly baked pizzas and their home made sausages and grilled Florentine steaks; and their seafood linguine pasta.There’s a small range of desserts with of course their tiramisu which is simply delicious. If you’re sufficiently friendly with the chief or manager, he’ll even offer you a complimentary limoncello to go with your coffee and dessert! They cater to large groups in the restaurant and to take-aways.The restaurant is located at 383 Bukit Timah Road, #01-02 Alocassia Service Apartments, Singapore 259727. Telephone: 6737 3546. They are open daily for dinner and closed for lunch on weekdays; but are happy to open at lunch time for a minimum of 10 persons, eg. Ladies or corporate lunches and for private parties, Call Luigi Artiaco for more information

We went during the Chinese New Year's Holidays, for dinner . It was too hot, we asked the waiter if the air con was on and his answer was a quick no and left and did not turn the air con inmediately! We had to ask a second time if he was going to turn it on, and finally he told the manager (who seemed a nice guy but he was not aware of the waiter's attitude). Once we had finished our glasses of wine, the waiter collected our glasses without asking if we wanted a second glass of wine, I still had about half of my plate, so a second glass would have been nice, but we both decided to finish our meal, not to eat dessert and leave. Terrible attitude of the waiter and even though the manager was present, he seemed not to notice. Two men were sitting on another table and were trying to catch his attention and the waiter kept on ignoring them, at the end, one stood up and walked to the waiter. It's a shame as the food is good, but when you go out for dinner you want to have a pleasant evening and with this water's attitude, I don't think anybody there that evening had a pleasant evening

We live nearby and enjoy going to Al Borgo or pick-up a Pizza. The food is very good, the Pizza excellent. The atmosphere is what you would expect from the smaller Restaurant around the corner, basic but nice. This is not the grand design place and don't expect fancy food. This is authentic, honest and good quality food at a reasonable price tag. The service is always attentive, fast and good

We live close to Al Borgo, and have eaten there several times over the lase year. The food is great. It has a real local charm to it. I would recommend going here for the food. Inventive, tasty and worth visiting. Service tends to be patchy at best, not uncommon in Singapore. The one annoying thing about the resturant is its smoking policy. In its outdoor tables there is no segregation or signage of smoking and non smoking tables, meaning you can be half way through eating your meal when someone lights up beside you. It spoils a great resturant.If you come here, don't forget to get a table inside
