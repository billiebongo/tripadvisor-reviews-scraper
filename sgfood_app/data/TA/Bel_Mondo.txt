Came back here again yesterday for the set lunch. Really very good value at $17 per person all in. I opted for the 3 cheese pizza with soup and a simple dessert accompanied by iced tea. All quite tasty. Worth returning to.
5
Very authentic Italian cuisine. American expat living in Singapore. Stumbled across Bel Mondo and will definitely come back. Very good!!
5
This was a great meal and great service. The lasagna was the best lasagna I have had in years. Good prices.
5
First-class food, great service: what more could you want?
Really handy for Suntec City, Millennia Walk, Conrad Hotel and Promenade mrt.
5
The overall experience a person gets from Bel Mondo deserves more than five stars. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet relaxed. Furthermore, the food is delicious; especially the Filet Mignon. The waiters work together to provide great service. It's a pleasure to dine at the restaurant.
5
Good quality, fast service, reasonable price. Close to suntec city and just out of the Conrad centenial
4
Great quick pasta, Gorgonzola gnocchi and linguini carbonara. Inexpensive, quality food. Glass of house white each, $68. Good sizes, not western sizes.

This rated one of the top places for pizza near where I'm staying so wanted to give it a shot. Its on the restaurant strip outside of mall to Milenia Walk. This is my first visit to this place. This place for lunch is jam-packed with business people. When I arrived I took the last of 2 tables available. There is indoor and outdoor seating options. I went ahead and order the Prosciutto with Parmigiano and Arugula pizza. They didn't ask if I wanted hot pepper, balsamic/OO, or Parmesan cheese with pizza...they just dropped it off and left and had to wait for someone to come back again to ask for items. Crust was good, plenty of toppings on top of pizza. I ordered the Ariancata Rosso Italian soda which was good.Then I had Tiramisu and Cappuccino for dessert. The tiramisu tasted fresh but couldn't really taste coffee/alcohol in it? Very decent sized portion since most in Singapore are small and very expensive for a "dessert."Coffee was good, smaller cup than I thought tho. The place was pretty loud with all the business chatter...Observing others' food all looked and smelled good.The only thing I will have to say is there were all women waitresses there except for one tall man....is that working in restaurant business and family owning a restaurant...that no matter HOW BUSY it is no server should ever run during service. This man the entire 1.5 hours I was there did nothing but run around like his head was chopped off. The women servers didn't do that. Looks very unprofessional and was dizzying to watch actually. Otherwise I'd go back a second time

I always visits bel mondo every time I’m in Singapore. This is my third or fourth time but for sure this won’t be the last. So I decided to come back last Friday night and I ordered pappardelle with Italian sausage (recommended by the waitress). And it was sooooo good. The pasta is well cooked. You will not forget the taste. One of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. The service is very good. Monica is very friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was very busy. And Guess what? She still remembers me and the food that I ordered after 2 years. She has a very good memory. It’s so nice going back to a place and someone remembers you. Kudos!! And they also serve happy hour buy one get one free for beer and Italian wine from 6pm to 8pm at a very affordable price. I really love this restaurant. Highly recommended. Two thumbs up!!!!

Even a thurs nite is crowded. Lots of working crowd chilling after work.Food is tasty but a bit on the high side. the 5 of us had mushroom soup, fried calamari for starter. oh weekday nite, they have 1 for 1 house pour wine. for main we went for risotto, lobster pasta, pork chop, pizza, ravioli - all are yummy.there is inside n outside dining area, we were inside so it was not so noisy. outside is mainly for people drinking / chilling. we shared the dessert - panna cotta and apple crumble
4
Came here today for lunch and opted for the 3 course lunch set for around $17. Really good value for money. I thought the broccoli soup was very decent.
3
The food is, of course, not authentic Italian food. However they try to do their best and in Asia you would not expect it to be like in Italy. Hence it is ok to go there.
4
Hidden alongside a number restaurants on Mellina Walk. There were 4 of us so the main courses were all different and none of us were disappointed with our choices. Good service and good value for money.

If you have done your research on Singapore then you will probably have already figured out that it is quite expensive to eat out.Therefore choosing where to eat is even more important as you seek value for money with good quality food and good service.In our opinion Bel Mondo ticks all those boxes. We found it by chance. It is located behind the Pan Pacific hotel, effectively if you look for the lifts on the outside of the Pan Pacific hotel, then this restaurant is in the street below them.The menu is comprehensive with many Italian favourites. The prices are reasonable and consistent with the rest of Singapore.They run a Happy Hour on wine and beer between 6pm and 8pm (i think every day of the week) which means a bottle of Peroni is $10SGD but you buy one get one free (alcohol is very expensive in Singapore so this is not a bad price at all)I ordered the Calzone and my wife ordered a pizza. The service was slick and attentive without being over the top. The food was great and my wife commented that having been to Italy she felt this pizza matched the pizzas she enjoyed there.I also ordered the chocolate brownie for desert which again was very pleasant.For the Calzone, pizza, four Tiger beers and the chocolate brownie the bill came to $93 SGD including the usual Government Service Tax of 7% and the service charge of 10%We must mention Simon who was our waiter during our time at the restaurant. He was very friendly, very accommodating and really made our experience enjoyable. He clearly has very good customer service skills. He took time to talk to us about all manner of sujects but also left us alone to enjoy our meal when appropriate. A very good member of staff who should be recognised for his professionalism.So in short, if you get the chance and you are in the area, then give this restaurant a chance, we do not think you will be disappointed

We have found this restaurant via UberEATS and fell in love with their pizzas right away. Thin-crust and authentic Italian Pizzas. This is how a pizza should taste!!!This is why we decided to come visit the restaurant itself. It's kind of hidden in the food alley of the Millennial Walk Mall but not difficult to find. It's a quiet and relaxing area actually. We liked that a lot.First impression of the restaurant was very positive. It looks very elegant and welcoming. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. We chose a table near the window and sat down satisfyingly. The best impression we had was on the food! The pizza was, as usual, EXCELLENT! We also ordered some calamaris with aioli, and a mushroom soup. Every dish tasted deliciously and we were very happy with the food. We could taste the high-end quality of the ingredients and the freshness of the dishes. That is one thing that's most important to us. We rounded up the evening with a homemade Tiramisu.... soooooo sooooo goood! Staff continued to be very nice, attentive and polite. If there is one thing that could be improved, then it's the bread that is offered as a complementary side. However, the over-delicious olive oil that came along with the bread compensated it all! So there is nothing we could complain about! We were very happy eating here. We will come back for sure

For a recent lunch break I tried out Bel Mondo restaurant for the first time, and was very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant offers alfresco as well as indoors dining, and I found the atmosphere to be very welcoming and relaxing at the same time. Bel Mondo is not only suited for the "lunch office crowd", but was also well equipped for families (nice high chairs for young guests) and bigger groups of diners. A really good first impression was followed by an even better experience with the food and beverage on offer at Bel Mondo. Not only is the three course lunch special a great value, but the menu choices provided are really quite nice: soup of the day or salad as a starter followed by either pasta or pizza as the main dish - with a good variety of dishes (incl. vegetarian and seafood options). As a "sweet finale" I was offered a really yummy scoop of ice cream - and who doesn't enjoy that for lunch on a hot day, right? Hot tea or coffee and alternatively soft drink choices are also included in the lunch special: what a great deal!In addition to the really fresh and well prepared food, I have to give the service team really the highest commendation: I forgot to mention that I wanted my main course (spaghetti aglio olio with freshly sauteed shrimps) to be prepared non-spicy. When the dish was brought to my table I quickly realized my mistake, and since I really cannot take spicy food I politely asked whether I could have a "replacement" dish - indicating that I would be happy to pay extra since it really was my oversight for not mentioning this request in the first place. The service staff did not accept my offer, and insisted to bring me the same dish prepared in non-spicy fashion without any extra charge. I was and still am very much impressed with this customer friendly approach, and needless to say I really enjoyed my main dish - which was served to me quite fast even "the second time 'round". Also, I was truly impressed by the friendliness of the service staff and their attention to detail concerning the needs of their customers: Bel Mondo truly has a super friendly and very professional service team: impressive! Bel Mondo is definitely a great find - and I will surely return to this little Italian gem; and not only for lunch, I'm sure! "Bella figura" all the way, and highly recommended

I just wanted a quick mean after a hectic day. I went with the lobster and house wine and it was really good.Don't get me wrong the lobster was really and over grown prawn, but the scallops were fat and tender.By Singapore standards this was a cheap and tasty meal.Happy hour 6pm to 8pm for beer and house wines is 2 for one and the prices aren't jacked up like other places.It was surprisingly busy when I arrived around 7pm, but the service was still good and attentive.My only regret is not ordering pizza, but then again that's an excuse to go back. ;
5
We ventured across the road from our hotel to this restaurant just requiring a snack. We went inside where the air conditioning was great for a warm night. We only had a Bruschetta and an Antipasto with a couple of drinks. The atmosphere was quiet and the service was good. Just what we neede
5
We have dined at Bel Mondo several times in the past and it was always a nice break from asian cuisine. We dined three times on our recent two-week stay in Singapore and we were always delighted. Over those three times, we had lasagna, pappardelle, pizzas, caesar salads, calamari and brownie sundaes. The "1 for 1" happy hour with beer and wine was also a nice way to start. The service was efficient and friendly, and the meals came up quickly. The restaurant was spotless and covered outside seating was available. It is across the street from the Conrad Hotel, the convention center and the Promenade MRT, making it very convenient to visit. We have been to Italy many times and the meals would compare favorably. We are looking forward to return visits

Was looking for a late afternoon something and decided to give Bel Mondo a try as it was right across the street from the Conrad Hotel. Pizza had an excellent, thin crust that was done to perfection. They gladly added my anchovies and provided me with a great glass of lemon tea. Will certainly be there again soon
3
Had dinner here as it is right across from the Conrad Centennial. Pizza was just ok. Truffle fries are very good. Only gave it an average rating because it is primarily a pizza restaurant. Should have better pizza.
2
Unfortunately a disappointing experience, very light on the ingredients, pizza had very little topping, buffalo mozzarella salad with no greens.
3
Good Italian restaurant. Average price. Had a cheese pizza.it was OK. Nothing extra, good nothing more.
4
Food were all excellent though was on the expensive range. Anyway, it was worth it as over-all taste of the food were very good.
5
Had read reviews about good food but poor service. We dined here twice, the second time on the insistence of our son, and we couldn't fault anything. Great food, friendly service and good value.
4
Lovely restaurant, food was very tasty and fresh, although the lasagne we had was just warm, we sent it back and staff were very apologetic and made a fresh hot one, although by the time the replacement arrived everyone else was finished eating. Other than this issue service was good , fast and friendly and we would return again
5
My friends went here for a girls night out in the middle of the work week. We were in the mood for italian and definitely did not hold back on our ordering. We spent close to 4 hours there savouring the timely served food. Staff were attentive and topped up our water and provided serviettes without us asking.For appetizers we had the Parmigiana and truffle fries. Fries were fried to perfection without being too oily. Truffle aroma was perfect without being overwhelming.For mains we had the cotechino sausage and wild mushroom parpadelle which was my personal favourite. Cream was not too heavy and the sausage melts in the mouth. The frutti de mare had a generous amount of seafood. We ended off with the home made tiramisu and apple crumble for dessert. I highly recommend the apple crumble. Apples had a good balance of acidity and sweetness. Crumble was just the right texture.Overall, I would definitely come back here when I'm craving for italian food.I am very excited to try the other food items from the menu!5 stars to this restaurant! :
5
I was not 100% convinced about eating here as the place was fairly empty, but went with it anyway. Well - I'm glad I did! The food was lovely - fresh, tasty and really good quality. I had truffle and porcini ravioli - amazing! - and garlic bread which was proper home made, and very garlicky - lush. Service was really friendly too - travelling and dining on my own, I felt well looked after. A great find - if I was here for longer, I'd be back as the menu has loads of other attractive-looking options.
5
Had dinner there late one night, was surprise by the good quality food and size of the meal was just right. Good wine list, but not cheap as most alcohol is a little expensive in Singapore, but some wines can be ordered by the glass. Pasta with vongole (clams) and another with some truffle elements , both very good and recommended
5
Being just opposite the Conrad hotel it was our go-to restaurant after a long day at work. Never busy, surprisingly, so so need to make a reservation, but the food was authentic Italian, varied and always hot and freshly made. Have been there several times and the friendly staff always welcome us back. The 2 for 1 Happy Hour also helps when drinks in Singapore are so expensive
3
It gave 3 decent courses at an acceptable price. Service was ok - not great though, glum on the whole. Still I enjoyed the food and I would go back.
5
Going to this restaurant you be enjoying one of the best Italian foods in the world. They know how to prepare their plates and how to treat you. Go there and enjoy a piece of Italy
5
Delicious meal especially the truffle pizza and truffle fries and very friendly owner. Nice place, quiet setting!
4
I was recommended by some of friends who had positive dining experiences here previously to try this place for their Italian food. Indeed the food was good and the service was attentive. We ordered the pizza Carnivora - the portion was generous and the crust was thin and crispy. The frutti de mare linguine is also a must try. I also enjoyed the modern and simple decor. Will come back again

We were staying at the Conrad Singapore and didn't want to venture too far after a busy day. Bel Mondo is literally just across the street. Although it looks very basic inside there is a hidden gem waiting to surprise you. We didn't have starters and all decided to go for pasta as s main and what good choices we made. The Vongole was the best I have ever had- beautiful. We also ordered the special pasta with scallops and lobster and were really surprised when it arrived with a whole (small) lobster on the plate and tasted wonderful and finally the spaghetti carbonara a third great choice. Dessert consisted of vanilla ice cream for 2 and they both said it was of a good quality and full of flavour, whilst I chose Pannacotta and I am so pleased I did. It was truly wonderful and ticked all the Pannacotta boxes. 2 for 1 wine was OK nothing special.Try it out, it's not fine dining but well worth a visit if you can see past the decor or rather lack of it.Staff are great too which makes a significant difference
4
Was staying at the the Conrad and wanted some good Italian food. Bel Mondo was literally 30 meters form the door and the food was excellent. The only negatives were the English skills of the wait staff and the veggie pizza description didn't Mention that it was covered in olives, which we don't like. To their credit, they quickly made another sans the olives (after they brought over a server who spoke English; hence, 4 instead of 5 stars
4
I wanted a quick lunch whilst staying across the street at the Conrad, so I dashed over to this restaurant. I only had a pizza margherita, but it was thin, crispy and not overloaded with cheese. The service was quick and attentive. It is not the most charming place, but you can sit outside and people-watch
5
I've been in Singapore for the last 25 years and I thought I definitely knew all the good Italian restaurants here - until I got this invite from a friend to join them at Bel Mondo.In a word, WOW! I love pizzas and their pizzas are definitely amongst Singapore's best, but it is all the appetizers and the side dishes that are truly great. For example, as a Dutchmen, I know my french fries, but their truffle french fries are simply the best fries I've ever tasted in my life! But not only this, all the appetizers were simply magic and you could build a full meal here by just trying out their appetizers only
4
Ristorante piccolino con la possibilitÃ  di stare al aperto. Ho mangiato la carbonara era molto buona. Il servizio era ok.This places offer the opportunity to have lunch or dinner outside. It's e small restaurant bad very good food. I have penne alla carbonara, the quality vos like in Italy. The service wos ok
5
While walking we spotted this Italian restaurant. They have a wide selection of food and drinks. It's so hard to choose. So we decided to order the bruschetta and for the main we have pizzas. The pizza is quite big and very delicious. The waitress always have a smiling face every time I looked at her. They also have the promotion for beers and wines at a very affordable price. Great service. Great food. Excellent. We are looking forward to another visit!!!
4
We had a great meal,well cooked and well presented. Obviously Italian style, a good menu with interest and variety. Certainly to be recommended over some of the nearby hotels.
5
What a great place, accidently found on a walk. A lovely welcoming atmosphere and great Italian themed food. Extensive menu and drinks list. Service was great and quick.
4
Food was good but I will not say it was the excellent Italian food I had. Throughout the Saturday night, we were the only patrons there. We ordered bruchetta, aglio olio, pasta with white sauce and plain iced water and the bill came up to $58.00. I felt the food was well over-priced. We needed to pay extra $4.00 for pathetic chicken bits to be added to the aglio olio. Staff were so-so and did not actively paid attention to us even though there were only two of us. Portion were not that big either. The restaurant is NOT disappointing but for me it was not value for money.
4
We had dinner here and enjoyed the food which is simple Italian but tasty and served promptly and hot. It is fairly good value for Singapore. The service was rather vague. We ordered wine but this sat at the side of the bar until way after we had eaten our starter. We had to ask for it and it still didn't appear for a further five minutes. This was a shame as the restaurant wasn't busy and there was no excuse. It rather spoiled the meal as we were drinking way after we had finished our food
5
It is definitely a good place to chill out with friends on a weekend. The newly renovated interior is comfortable and neat.The food quality is fantastic, i love the cabonara, duck pizza and the apple pie with vanilla gelato.Service was great as well! I love this place, and would recommend it to friends and family
4
Visited this restaurant recently with my colleagues for dinner on a weekday. The staffs were friendly and nice to recommend food for us. Heard from the staffs that they had just renovated the restaurant, cozy nice atmosphere. Loved the seafood linguine and apple pie with gelato ice cream! The food is good in general except for the tiramisu. Highly recommended for those looking for authentic italian food
5
Food was really fantastic, the Italian food is as authentic as any you can find in Singapore. Really enjoyed their pasta and pizza, and I would definitely recommend their burrata as well. Service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere is very nice after their renovation. A really nice place for dinner or for drinks at night
2
Bel Mondo offers a very good value lunchtime set menu for $17++ for three courses, although with drinks and a latte per person it's be $30 all in. The food was fine - green salad or bowl of soup, choice of large pizza or pasta and a scoop of ice cream. Really nice food and good value.However, the service was mediocre. The waitress forgot our drinks order (two soda waters, so not taxing) and our coffee order and when we paid the bill the waiter had to be asked to return the Visa card. The whole point of a lunchtime set is that it is quick and efficient, not that you have to ask over and over for the order! The place wasn't full so there wasn't much of an excuse, just the lack of a system or process
5
Spacious interiors with a cosy decor, able to accommodate larger groups. Staff were friendly and helpful in giving recommendations. We loved the lobster pasta for the generous portion of lobster as well as the thin crust mushroom pizza. Tiramisu and panna cotta is worth a try and will satisfy your cravings for desserts
5
I visited the restaurant with my mom and 2 children on Sunday. The decoration is modern & classy.I ordered a lobster linguine for myself while my mom got aglio olio spaghetti. The children shared a pizza diavola (pepperoni). Nice presentation of the dishes and the food was delicious. Service was good.I recommend this cosy italian restaurant to those around the area who likes good italiano.Also before we left the lady boss gave my children lollipops which made them very happy. Thanks
5
The restaurant was really nice. The food is tasty and authentically Italian. The staff are so attentive and friendly and the menu has plenty of options. It's really great for business lunches as it's located within the business areas.
4
Enjoyed the restaurant, good portion sizes reasonably priced. The 2 for one hour happy hour on wine up to 8pm is nice also.
5
we visited this restaurant last year and this time it didn't disappoint either. The service was excellent and the food nicely presented and delicious. This restaurant suited our family of 6, grandparents and 2 teenagers and was good value for money. Good choice of pasta dishes, pizza and the cod special was really good. Situated in a small street with lots of prestige cars to look at after dinner. Worth a visit!
3
Came here for the $17 nett set lunch today. This consists of soup, pasta, a small dessert (gelato) and a drink (you can pay an extra $2 to upgrade to a cappuccino). Food was decent enough without being exceptional. Service could do with some improvement: lacklustre and without any real passion. Reasonable value for money for the area
5
I have been living in Singapore for 7 years now and this is the first time I had a flawless experience in an Italian restaurant. And I must say that we go quite often to Italian and places that claim to be Italian. All the items ordered were beyond expectation. The burrata was extremely soft and creamy, the porcini tagliatelle was cooked to the right texture and the ossobuco was just perfect. All the ingredients were really fresh and the grissini with parma ham was the best I ever had
4
Went for a business lunch. Ordered beef lasagne and the portion is quite generous. It taste great as well. It does come with a slightly above average price tag but is well worth it for business lunches, meeting clients, and other special events. Definitely worth a try if you're craving for Italian and in the area.
4
After our flight in, we were looking for a good place to eat for 4 adults and 2 small kids and Bel Mondo was perfect We had 2 pizzas and a wonderful creamy burrata salad...it was jut what we needed and was perfect for the kids. The restaurant is also in a neat area just down the way from an energetic pub yet still quiet enough where we could actually talk and admire the city lights on our first Singapore evening
1
I ate here on the Tuesday and had a standard fair, yet it was very nice with prompt service and the price at SGD$40 each for 3 courses and a glass of wine was very good. That is a 3 star meal.I went back on my last Saturday and ordered the same dishes I had, had the first time. As I was half way through my first course there started the most awful hacking coughing from the kitchen. Disgusting rounds of hacking, coughing which went on and on and on. This time I was facing the chefs and there is a window area where you can see them working and they would pick up their mobile phones and use them between food preparation with no evidence of washing hands. I tried to cancel my next dish and was told it was too late. I said I would pay for it, but they should not serve it to me, they insisted on giving it to me in a takeaway box. I did not go into detail with them as to why I was unhappy - did not wish to bother with the grief. I finished my drink (2 for one deal which was surprise) - served by the barman (no coughing), paid and left.Maybe this happened on the Tuesday, maybe it was a bad day? I just know that I will never go to that restaurant again on subsequent visits to Singapore. This is the first time I have given anything a 1 star rating on Trip Advisor and if I had not gone back on Saturday it would have gotten a 3 star rating. Service from the front of house staff was good
5
Visited with myself 2 children 16 & 14 and 2 grandparents. Greeted warmly and order taken promptly. Kids had pizza and pasta which was delicious. My chicken cacciatore served with risotto was fantastic. Mum had the cod special which she enjoyed. Dad opted for lasagne. We had deserts which were excellent. We enjoyed our meal so much we returned a few nights later for dinner. This was our last night in Singapore and yet again had a lovely meal and excellent service. This Italian is definitely somewhere we would return to. Good value excellent food and very friendly service especially from the young boy!!
4
We really enjoyed eating at this restaurant, it may not have the best view in Singapore but very pleasant to sit outdoors and people watch while you have a leisurely dinner. We found the waiter to be very 'on the ball' and friendly, he made us aware that they had an offer on for a bottle of wine which made it more reasonable, it was infact some of the nicest wine we had on our whole trip. It was his good customer service that decided us to to back and eat there again 2 days later. The food was very tasty if a tad pricey but then it is Singapore, the puddings are delisious if you have room for one. We would eat here again
