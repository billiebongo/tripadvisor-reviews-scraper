Never did fancy Soba but I hv been turned around by what we had. Sukiyaki Soba was good, soup based, not salty n went well with the Soba. Tried the Dry Soba and it was just as good. Loved the big bowls presentation!ðŸ¤—

Authentic japanese cuisine. Reasonable prices and soba was fresh and very good. Service attentive and polite.

Springy soba in thick broth.
Caught a great deal by going for their limited 1-for-1 promotion.
Good service but not so fast serving.
Highly recommended!

The soba bowls are huge. I had hot soba with ebi tempura. As the server recommended, best to remove the ebi from the soba immediately so they remain crisp. Service was great - they wrote a little new year note for us. Sometimes it's the small things that make the difference.

This is one fantastic Soba place for lunch or dinner. Offering their signature 80% buckwheat flour Soba. Taste just as good as the Soba I tasted in japan. There are cold and hot variants whichever style of Soba you prefer. When you are there, please order the Special Truffles Dashi Maki Tamago with Club Japanese Sauce, it is very good
