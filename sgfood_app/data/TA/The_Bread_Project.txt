They have one of the best croissant. The store in joo chiat is just small, it opens at 9 am and closes at 5 pm. There are plenty of selections in the morning than in the afternoon.

This little gem of a bakery sells artisan breads and pastries. We had breakfast from there as it was the only food outlet open at 0900h along Joo Chiat Rd.the method was truly French with a proper full puff pastry made with butter rather than margarine.we had a selection of all the classics.. the snail, pain au chocolat and croissant...as well as a few favourites of a less classic style such as apple turnover and a cinnamon sticky bun to put the the US to shame. All they need is a good barista and a few outdoor seats and they would be on an absolute winner
