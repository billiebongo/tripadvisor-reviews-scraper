Good food and ambience, enjoyed the place, not to forget the instant service, enjoyed the overall experience

The place is nice with Indian design elements. The wait for the food was slightly long, but worth it. The food was super delicious.

Went there with a friend to celebrate her birthday. Portions are small and take a while to come. Food was tasty and the ambience for 2 was cosy. Orders are placed using an iPad. We ordered cocktails which were rather diluted.
3
Ordered the fish tikka, naan basket, butter chicken, palak paneer and aloo gobi to share for lunch. Dishes were decent but standards seem to have dropped.
5
Very good food - particularly the vegetarian options - very good service - and a good place to eat outside
2
Decent food. For the amount they are charging, the portions are miniscule. $24 for about 6-7 tiny shrimps. There are better choices available.

One of my most favourite places for the last 4 years, specially because in this area you cannot find much Indian Vegetarian food.They server non-vegetarian food as well.Ambience is average, you can sit inside or outside.They have some discount on A la carte if you go for lunch on weekdays.A good time to go preferably would be weekends and evenings, the place a lot of places to eat in the surroundings

The food served is hot and good-tasting. We ordered rogan-josh, palak paneer, paratha, saffron rice and a chicken dish. Portions were decent and we ended up packing some of the unfinished food. Food was tasty. Lamb was soft, succulent and well cooked. Chicken was also tasty and well-cooked. Paratha was tasty as well. Their puthina chutney was awesome. The ambience of the place was fantastic at night. The only issue is that the prices of the food was quite steep compared with the same dishes in Little India.

Once again, it all depends on what one wants. I find the Holland Village scene, all this twentysomething Singapore publet-crawling bankers and business Ang Mohs, slightly off-putting, as it's not my idea of a good time how that place apparently tries to imitate Phnom Penh on a bad night, in a Bucharest kind of way (at least no poshpackers). And this is an Indian standard restaurant in this context. Rather industrial mini-chain feel; generic; outside and inside seating (we sat outside); not one Indian customer except at my table; not one Indian waiter. The waiters a bit pushy; ok, that is probably their job in this context. A huge rat speeding at me halfway through dinner; ok, that happens, but it still doesn't make me happy.But we actually went for the food, which was overall okay. The bread was good in an average way, the dishes were good and one very good (the saag paneer), the dessert was okay. Beer was cold. Some people here have complained about the small portions; I think they were adequate and given global obesity among the kind of people that eats in Holland Village restaurants, this is nothing to complain about. But surely this is not a place where anyone ever needs a doggy bag. And the thing is, Singapore has a lot of very good, even excellent Indians, and certainly a lot of great food, so there is no need here to go for "average-good".In sum, if you want to eat at Holland Village, because you like the scene; *and* if for some reason it should be Indian, then I can see that you go to Kinara. Otherwise, not

I went with my family to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered Prawns Biryani,Baingan Bharta,Parathas,soup and wine. I'm embarrassed for thinking this place was good. Baingan Bharta was absolutely tasteless with lots of extra oil. Biryani was ok,but not up to the mark(again,so much oil in that) They seriously needs to pay attention to the quality of food served. I'm sure that I won't return here and wouldn't recommend this to anyone else.

Routine Indi√°n food but good and tasty. Good venue and popular. Inside and outside seating options in vibrant Holland village.
5
The place was super cool and exotic! Feel like dining in Egypt. Was there for my colleagues' farewell and birthday lunch! There was 10 of us. Awesome frontline service! Worth every penny spent! Will recommend to colleagues for any types of occasion. (:

I visited this place for dinner with fiends. My stomach is still in pain. Some of the dishes were not hot and as a result I have been suffering. This place is bad news. Staff unfriendly and surly.

Sometimes, you are just tired of sitting in stiff ambiences. You want to chill out, relax and watch people go by while you enjoy your meal and sip a refreshing drink. Kinara- literally is a corner on a lively street where all the pubcrawling youngsters/chiongsters hangout. The food here is nicely plated, the service is very neat and manly :) The food - well its Indian food made the right way- try to order by guts (remember, unlike the west here recommendations in Asia do not neccessarily reflect the best dishes of the place)/so trust your instincts. You wont be disappointed- the place has good food to offer with a nice outdoor patio seating. Once fed, head to the pubs ahead to get yourself fixed for the night and you may be heading straight to the clubs after a nice fix= afterall you don't come to Holland Village to just eat :

A lovely Indian restaurant with expert staff serving very good Indian food by the roadside, closed off to traffic in the evening so people watching is colourful. We all enjoyed our meals and I had my favourite, Rogan Josh, which was very good and compared well to others I have had. Reasonable prices and good portions. will return in the future
3
Dropped by Kinara when looking for something to eat at Holland Village and decided to give it a try. Ordered butter chicken, paprika prawns, garlic nan and rice. Portion is not big for the price. Food is quite ok, although not the best Indian food I have eaten. Overall a nice spot for a casual dinner out.
5
The food is AWESOME. And the menu was recently upgraded so the spread is wider & the taste is delectable. For our veggie palate - the reshmi paneer tikka, malai kofta & garlic naan are all-time hits.The service is BRILLIANT. The staff is always willing to go the extra mile & serve with a smile. They also deliver home which is a huge help when we are hosting guests and need big quantities - and they serve at short notice.The location is OUTSTANDING. Located in a busy hub full of restaurants.. the lovely street is shut to traffic in the evenings. Walking distance from Holland Village MRT

Our first outting in Holland village, it was a Friday and the restaurant was full at 8 PM. We made a request and upon checking with a guest who reserved a table but was yet to arrive (and was going to be late), the manager offered us a table. Courteous server.It is a small restaurant with limited tables, adjoining several other restaurants on the street. We sat outside, in open air, the atmosphere was lively. Table was lit by small candle. People were generally in larger groups.As we settled, some complementary Papad and nice chutney was served. Every table is given a per-programmed iPad where you can browse dishes, select and confirm. As you confirm, your order is submitted and goes inside the Kitchen. Technology has come ages!And the food came quick, considering it was a Friday will full house I was impressed.Starters were good. Paneer chatpata was chatpata. Dal Kinara was mind-blowing. Tandoori roti was big in size, crisp, butter. Other dishes were okay.Overall, enjoyed the food. For the good taste, we will surely comeback to explore more. Price: It is on a higher side considering the location but is worth it!Tip: Make a reservation especially if you are going in a large group or keep time in hand

Popped into Kinara on the recommendation of local residents and was not disappointed. The naan bread was a peppered up version that was a contrast to the norm. I had the lamb vindaloo with saffron rice which was finished quickly and washed down with a jug of Tiger beer. Will return here when next in Singapore. Recommend highly if you are in the area

For our family Kinara is THAT place everyone in the family says "Yes!" to, every single time. As any parent of teens knows, that is no small thing. It ticks all the boxes: good flavor but not too spicy (unless requested), traditional but also caters to western pallet, good options for veg or meat eaters. Cocktails/beer are basic but cold, as is the air-con inside. Outside tables are on a quieter end of a busy pedestrian street that closes to cars in the evening & across from the old Holland Village Hawker Center making it an excellent spot for people-watching.  The food at Kinara is made to order and surprisingly consistent. For some reason it's not as busy at this end of the street, but also less of a bar scene, making it a nice place for families or a quieter evening.  Recommend: Tandoori Paneer, excellent Samosas, Peas Pulau, My daughter raves about their Palak Paneer, husband loves the tandoori fish, and I love their special Kinara Dhal.  Servers here all all friendly and greet us warmly every time along with the other regulars who are clearly as devoted as we are. (As if on cue write this one of the waiters just stopped by to tell me I look lovely tonight & the owner brought me a complimentary G&T! :)  Inside walls could use a spring cleaning but the carved doorways and pillowed alcoves make up for the somewhat worn paint. Prices are mid-range but for our family easily worth it every time. Opens for dinner at 6pm & delivers via Food Panda.

Food is tasteful, service is good, have good booths to sit and use tablet to order the food. Recommend this place for sure.
3
Very good location. Ambience is quite good. Service is quite prompt. Biryani is quite good. Other dishes are tasty but quite oily. If you don't like oily food then its not recommended.
4
A nice Indian Restaurant with good selection of items. The taste is authentic. The portions are large.
The vegetarian selection is very nice and interesting.

This restaurant serves average Indian food. The ambience is great, the food I would say is average for the price I paid. Strictly a one time visit

Went to weekday Lunch. Food was better then last time when we visited few months back. We had Dal Kinara, Alu-Gobhi Veggie, Tandoori Roti and Jeera Rice. On top of that we had one Mango Kulfi. Dal was very good, not oily or spicy, no cream etc. Mango Kulfi was surprisingly good too.Lunch has 50% discount and we paid only $30 for all the items, very good value for money in Holland Village.Wait time was over 20 minutes, service was polite and courteous

Holland Village is a lovely setting for a nice dinner especially if you have a table outside. We have visited Kinara a few times in the past. Okay to decent Indian food, lovely service punctuated with loud intrusive music emanating from the neighboring bar. Our last visit to Kinara was a mighty letdown. And mind you, this inspite of not being a weekend. Weekends do tend to get crowded and rushed which does compromise the food quality. But on our week day outing, everything that we ordered, the veg as well as the non veg dishes, was insipid and almost inedible (the lamb was sweet enough to describe it as dipped in honey/sugar syrup) The chef had forgotten the existence and use of salt and a whole lot of spices, the latter being indispensable for Indian cuisine.The service was as usual pleasant and the noise from the next door bar was only adding to the misery that our evening was turning out to be. Kinara was one of our good bets for North Indian food in Singapore. Now we aren't so sure of that. 'We shall never ever eat at Kinara' is a mighty strong sentiment, but we sure wont be visiting it for a long long time to come. If you do decide to eat at Kinara, do cross your fingers and pray that the chef remembers to add salt and spices to your order. All the best

Hands down this is the best North Indian food restaurant I've eaten at period, and I eat Indian 2-3x a week, but am not Indian. The food is to die for, the general manager Bhagwat and his staff are extremely friendly and professional. Today they even threw in some food on the house just to let us try something new. We have eaten many times here and the quality is always fantastic. Highly recommended if you visit Holland Village

This lovely restaurant in Holland Village has a great menu with so much variety. The portions are generous so be wary of ordering too much as a couple. Reasonably priced and the staff are friendly. Our recommendations for dishes would be the Tandoori Bharwan Aloo as a starter with a garlic naan and the Laal Maas Rajasthani and Kinara Fish Curry as mains with rice
4
I have to say I did like the restaurant a lot. They did try and get us to buy the most expensive things on the menu and only directed us to alcohol when asked what drinks they had. Apart from this, I would recommend, very good food and service.
3
I have dined here many times with my family over the past few years and I have to say the standard has gone down. We ordered tomato soup for starters, missi rotti, garlic naan, butter chicken, navaratan Akbhari for mains, kulfi and Masala chai for desserts.The tomato soup was pretty average but the portion was huge. The naan and rotti were fluffy and flavorful. The butter chicken was subtly spiced and tangy but it wasn't buttery enough. The navartan Akbhari was very creamy and had nine types of ingredients which included variety of vegetables, grapes and cashews. The dish was aromatic but lacked right amount of seasoning. The mango kulfi was creamy and nutty. The Masala Chai was very subtly spiced hence, lacked the flavour. Overall, the food was pretty average, the price is on the steep side but the service was prompt
4
If you feel like having Indian this is the place to go. The food is excellent and the service is friendly. I've ordered the lamb curry and it came with a nice portion of yogurt to soften the hot spices. I would go for more
4
Service was good and quick. Food is fresh. Authentic. Nice setting although seats were a little crowded.
5
It was our best day to enjoy the best service & food in Kinara! Staffs have been so attentative & provide their best service to meet our needs
3
Pricey, slightly upmarket, good wine selection slow service but friendly/courteous staff. Great location.
4
Food was excellent but the service left quite a lot to be desired especially considering the prices.
5
good taste, fast delivery, can make it spicy per Indian requirement, door delivery is good, best is they understand the change needed and send the same along
4
Good food, good service. Love their 'dal kinara', garlic naan and lassi.
Nice al fresco seating option.
Indian food can be quite heavy though so eat cautiously.
5
Excellent food and excellent service too.
Great sitting outside watching the world go by whilst you munch your way through your chosen fare.
Well worth a visit

Decided to try Kinara instead of my usual Curry Hut as it has seemed busy when I've walked past it. Unfortunately it was terribly disappointing and I can't understand why it's so popular. The curries were just average, none of them particularly interesting or tasty. One of our party asked for some curry sauce to go with his tandoori chicken. The waiter said that the curries are prepackaged so the sauce can't be separated from the meat which meant no side of sauce for my friend. I mean, it's a pretty basic request to have some sauce on the side, but clearly there aren't any cooks or any actual cooking going on here, but just heating of prepackaged foods. In contrast, Curry Hut have never had any issues supplying some sauce on the side. The food was also very expensive. Will not be back

I regret for not coming here before. In all honesty, I rate this place one of the better ones in Holland Village when you take into account the mix of the location, quality of food and service.Talk to the "magician" manager (forgot his name) who, despite the restaurant was full, could stille arrange a table. All staff were courteous, smiling, attentive. Really, this was an evening well spend

Visited Kinara this tuesday. 4 adults and 2 kids. Food and service was very good. We have been there several times and will come back.

This place serves delicious North Indian food! The service is excellent. Wide range of menu. All the dishes are tasty, not oily or rich. They even cater to your special request.
Must eat if you are in Holland area in Singapore

Visited the Holland Village outlet , we had the paneer tikka as a starter which was excellent, the main courses of a vegetarian dish, dhal and rotis were all good. Service was smooth and courteous, enhanced by the use of an iPad for customizing your orders. Prices reasonable for this location, except for the beer, $10++ for a 330 ml bottle of Tiger is a bit too hig

I am writing this review only because of the change in cost of food which has just whooped up and quantity has gone way low, the staff servers better only to people they are known. All in all not very pleasant experience. Initially they had starter served to every customer which I noticed has changed and it's just to known customers. Seriously!! There are better restaurants in Singapore, pathetic taste, avoid this one as many good places in this cost and better service & tast

I had a quick business lunch at Kinara, located in Holland Village. Although the main area is small, the ambiance is warm and comfortable, with attractive decorations. Ordering is done on an iPad--you scroll through and find selections, then add them to your order. We had three vegetable dishes (including the excellent eggplant), a chicken dish, jasmine rice, raita, and nan, and fruit drinks and beer. Papadams arrive at the table as soon as you sit down, accompanied by chutneys. Service was efficient and the food came quickly, although the place wasn't very full. Dishes can easily be shared. Overall a good choice for lunch, with well-prepared Indiana favorites

We often eat at kinara and have never been disappointed. Even on a busy Friday or Saturday night in Holland village you are able to get a table. They have an excellent service of ordering food on an ipad, which allows you to take your time and browse the menu at your leisure. The waiting staff themselves are very helpful and the food arrives promptly and they always top up your glass with iced water. The food itself is excellent with a great range of starters, curries, rice and breads. One friend we went with is lactose intolerant and the staff were very helpful at recommendeding and making a curry to suit her needs. Definitely worth a visit!

Kinara is in Holland Village and there are plenty of decent places to eat in the area.We stopped at Kinara as it looked quite busy... the food was good, but just not great... the naan bread was a little too thin (almost as thin as the pappadums!)...We sat outside on the street - great for people watching! :--)Worth a visit, but not the best indian food we've had in Singapore
4
We came here for a casual dinner and ended up having an elaborate one! Almost everything on the menu looks and tastes authentic Indian. We tried Chicken Tikka, Kadhai Paneer and Black dal. The flavours were perfect with right blend of spices. The only disappointment was the quantity of portions. What seemed enough turned out to be a little less for the four of us.Overall, a good option for people looking for good north Indian cuisine at not very high prices

I used to frequent Kinara previously (before I had started writing in Tripadvisor) and used to like the place. It is a small Restaurant, used to be mid range and used to have very good food. I had the same expectation when I booked for a dinner with my colleagues. To start with, I had my first shock to see the price on the Menu card. It had grown significantly over the years, but for that matter everything has become expensive...so decided to order.We started with the Beer pitcher ($34) and Kebab platter ($55) which had an assortment of meat and seafood. However, to our utter dismay, some of the items were cold. WIth that kind of pricing, the restaurant should have at least done a proper re-heating. Our feedback to the floor Manager was brushed off nonchalantly. Hara Bhara Kebab was good but the crispy ladies finger was strictly OK. After experiencing the kebab, we decided to switch to Chinese (Indian) and ordered Chili Chicken - which was good. On the main course, we ordered a Naan Basket ($16) which was strictly 4 naans. Generally in Restaurants, bread baskets are economical compared to ordering breads individually which was not in this case. There was still some surprise in store for us. At teh time of booking (over phone), I was assured of a 15% discount on payment through Stanchart card. However, at the time of payment, we were curtly informed that the discount was only on the food and not on the beverages a fact which had not been highlighted earlier. It is ridiculous to have such a condition and it is a ploy of the restaurant to dupe the customers who fail to take note of it.At $60 per pax, I would rather go to better places. This restaurant is simply not to that leve

We are regular visitors of this restaurant plus all our indian home orders are from this place (holland village resturant). Super courteous staff, owners take personal care of guests and do not hesitate in even clearing the tables. Food is marvelous. Authentic Indian taste and it always turns out to be a perfect meal.Hope they remain like this always. There are very few restaurants in singapore where staff actually shows hospitality
