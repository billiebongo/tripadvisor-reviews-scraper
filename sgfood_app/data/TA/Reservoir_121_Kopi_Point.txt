Non aircon clean coffeeshop located along Bedok Reservoir Road. Noticed that smokers increased, they also smoked at the non-smoker section. Little unpleasant.Also surprised that the coffeeshop charges the most expensive hot and cold beverages. Tea / Coffee withouf milk at $1.10 per cup. Cold soft drinks, iced lemon tea, water chestnut drink at $1.50 per glass. All drinks cost about 20 cents more than the rest.

Visited this coffeeshop again. Tried the seafood clear soup previously.Today decided to try 永盛 soup stall again. The stall sells very tasty clear fish and seafood soup. The fish and seafood used were very fresh. A bowl of soup costs $3.80. The quality of the food remains the same thus really value for money. Placed the order with the cashier, collect a number and await to be called. Estimated waiting time about 10-20 minutes. Self served.Enjoyed. Will come again

Visited this coffeeshop today.Ordered laksa from Teochew Noodle stall. The laksa gravy is thick and tasty. One of the few good ones remaining in the heartland. It's $3.50 per bowl and valued for money, having me coming back continuously 2 days. A glass of iced lemon tea ($1.40) to go along is just perfect.Really enjoyed this simple Saturday dinner

Visited Reservoir 121 Kopi Point for dinner tonight. It is a non aircon coffeeshop with 1 drink stall, 8 Chinese stalls & 1 Muslim stall. Wide range of food to choose. No waiter, everything will be self serve. Pay and self collect basis.Clean environment but little warm. Ordered laksa at $3.50 per bowl, food was completely acceptable.
