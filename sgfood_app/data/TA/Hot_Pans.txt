After eating at the nearby Chop Chop, we wanted some dessert and Hot Pan's selections looked interesting. We ordered the pear and apple crumble for $9, which was a little pricey but at least there is no sales tax.It came in a very hot pan and the Dutch pancake was delicious and tasted of egg. The diced apples and pears went nicely with the ice cream and the crumble.Desserts start from @$6 so do give this place a try if you are in the area

Didn't have any expectation whatsoever. Saw someone having it & decided to gave it a try. We absolutely loved it, the crumble with the icecream & melon worked so well in the mouth. The pastry tasted a lil' eggy, but overall still a nice dish to finish off the meal
