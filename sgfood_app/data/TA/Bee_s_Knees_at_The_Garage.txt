had breakfast at Bee's Knees @ The Garage one weekend and we ordered the bacon & eggs, croissant sandwich and coffee. Food was best described as forgettable... ...but not bad.
1
Iced mocha was bad- a sin for a cafe
Pasta was ok but nothing to shout about
Salmon w scrambled eggs blah
Waiters appeared lost

I have been looking for some wegetarian food and staff recommended the veggie goat salad. Little bit pricey, but it was one of the best food I have had in my life. Variety of flavors in this salad was extraordinary. Beautiful surroundings and excellent service making this restaurant worth a visit.

Have been very keen to check out and visit the place since it’s nestled in the gardens.Finally I’m able to visit this month with my Girlfriend.A bit pricy for the service and food.Perhaps my expectations’ a little high for the place.Might not be back again

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The reviews are mixed to say the least, but the menu was varied (Italian themed) and there was a good selection. There is seating both inside and outdoors and the waiting staff were friendly and quick with their service. As a stop for lunch before or after strolling through the gardens, it’s perfect

i really wanted to go to the 2nd floor to the Botanico at the Garage.......but they were hosting a wedding. So I've already walked all that way and opted at the lower level (level 1) Bee's Knees at the Garage. This place was really busy and I went during brunch time. You order outside then they deliver it to your table. I ordered the Pinche Chicken Sandwich. Comes with chips on side. I thought the sandwich would be much bigger in size esp with the cost of it...so it was a bit on the smaller size. However, the flavor was really good. chips were fine. I ordered the Lemon Coconut cake....again size is very small for the cost...flavor was good but pound cake was slightly on the dry side. Def a good choice to try out if you are willing to walk all that way at the Gardens. Good way to burn some calories afterwards

We just headed for one of those food symbols on the map because, having made the extensive trek from one side of the gardens to the other in scorching heat, I needed a drink. Walking in I did a quick scan of what food people were eating, as us foodies do, and liked what I saw, so we turned it into brunch. This is a, 'order it yourself and the wait staff bring it', type place and it worked well. I ordered a pizza and watch chef make it from scratch through the window to the kitchen. This isn't fast food but I was happy to wait and enjoy my cold vanilla bean espresso coffee. Yum!The pizza was delightful. My dining partner had a Singaporean noodle dish and raved over it. The wait staff were attentive and friendly and had a smile for everyone. This was a welcome bonus on our garden trek

We wanted just that - brunch in the nature and discovered Bee's Knees!It was the perfect setting and you don't have to worry about the heat as they have all these huge coolers and fans for the diners outdoors.3 of us ordered brunch while 1 had the crab meat pasta and they were all good!!Drinks were alright and you definitely got to end off with their pandan pancake and churros! The churros are highly recommended as its crispy on the outside and not overly doughy on the inside. You get pockets of air that makes it the right amount of fluffiness.Orders have to be placed at the counter and paid first but the dishes come served to you so don't expect 3-star Michelin service. However staffs are all friendly and helpful with our requests so no complains there! Overall, i'd certainly return again

We were here for lunch. The setting is green and lush. It gets hot outside despite the fans and shade. I understand this is a garden but the metal chairs aren’t the best for manouevering, especially for children and the elderly.The quinoa salad, cous cous salad, Ruben sliders and fried chicken were all tasty and good. The figs in the salad were a nice touch. The dessert, though. was a flop. The red velvet cupcakes were utterly dry and tasteless and the blob of icing on top was rubbery. I have tried their desserts several times and can safely say dessert isn’t their strong suit. Service was perfunctory. One able -bodied man was even allowed to cut queue at the cashier. There are better places to dine at the Botanic Gardens. Service and food at Halia and Casa Verde are better, and Corner House is of course in a class of its own

I went with family and friends for the first time last Sunday. The place was crowded and it was not easy to find staff to help us getting a table. Food was great, they have a good selection of pasta, pizza, sandwiches and finger food. Good taste and presentation. Servings are reasonable too, enough to be satisfied. It is possible to get coffee and dessert as well. I ordered the pesto genovese pasta and it met my expectations. I think service could improve, as we noticed that some dishes were taking much longer than others and when we inquired about it, no one could give a quick answer to what was going on

Salad, pasta, and other causal choices, Sevings are a little small.
Desserts are quite good. The Queue for orders can be quite long during lunch so budget enough time.
4
Enjoyed salad here loads of scrumpy feta & falafel! Not a destination in its own right but perfect for passing custom in the gardens.
4
Good crispy fries. Beef ragu tender savory. Beef wagyu salad well done, surprised by the tastiness of the smashed eggplant.
Pork sliders dry..poacheds eggs and Hollandaise done right with portobello mushrooms cooked well.
Dogs are welcomed.

Food was not impressive at all. The tiger prawn pasta ($18) came with 4 prawns (this I was impressed) but they were burnt. The burnt taste stuck with the linguini, which overpowers the rest of the food. Should have gone with my initial choice of eggs. Bottleneck at the drinks counter so our drinks only came halfway through our meal. Good place for pet owners because pets are allowed at the outdoor seats.

Well located (as it is in the Botanics) which was the main draw for us; decent decor - but that's it on the positive side. The salads & sides were depressing; meagre portions & no flavour; OK juices; & the chap taking our order had a chip on his shoulder. Simply not worth the 15mts trek on a hot, hot Singapore da

being an avid cafe person, when i found out about this place and the viewing the promising menu, i decided to bring my family here for weekend lunch...... what a mistake.the tiger prawn pasta was horrible albeit there were 2 large sized tiger prawns and 2 small tiger sized prawns - the pasta tasted overwhelmingly with the smell of the prawns (although linguine itself was nicely done al dente). truffle tater tots and caramelised apple waffles were very good. wanted to order the truffle parmesan fires but realised they were steak fries so luckily i gave it a miss. now, the latte and chai latte were horrible. should have ordered their juice, shakes or sodas. service wise... what's service!? zero smiles. not even a 'you are welcomed' or a simple smile when 'thank you' was said to them. cashier was bad...so bad, everyone had to repeat their order more than twice to him and he still can manage to get it wrong! after which, no repeating back of what order he took down, and neither telling you to anything. i ordered the kaya lychee cake and the lemon coconut cake, both to go - he packed the lemon coconut cake, gave me a number to wait, and assumed that i know they will bring the kaya lychee cake to me. when we intially went inside when just arrived, it was 3/4 packed (around 1130am), the waiter told us we can sit upstairs but it's another resturant. i said i would like to eat here at bee's knees, his response was, 'so sit outside''. seriously? the only acceptable of what this place could call service was from the skinny indian/singh guy who seems to be new, he was attentive and had initative. hmmm, no service because they dont charge service price? or wait, because you only serve expats with service? plus point is you can bring you pet dogs there and they will provide a water bowl for the pets.... other than that, never again for me and definitely not going to recommand this place to my friends. any single cafe from kampong glam can beat this place in terms of service and food taste

Nice lunch here. Had truffle carbonara, truffle pizza and truffle fries with two different salads. Salads were excellent - bursting with flavours and textures. Truffle fries were lacking truffle flavour but the pizza and carbonara were good (despite the carbonara looking a little unappealing due to being slightly curdled). Toilets needed checking and cleaning more often. Male/female shared loos and the floor was quite wet with tissues stuck in it so bit disgusting and kind of put me off my food.

Bee's Knees at The Garage is a little quaint cafe in the Cluny side of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. Housed in a restored old black & white bungalow, it has both indoor (air-conditioned) and outdoor seating. The menu isn't extensive, but quality of food is good and portions are generous. Price-wise, while it's not cheap, it's still ok for an occasional visit. I went there twice in a week, once with a friend and spent almost 2 hours there just eating and talking. The 2nd visit was with my family. Both times, food was good. I'd recommend a visit.

We visited the Bee's Knees at the Garage when trying to find a place for refreshments. My initial expectation was that this would be overpriced and below average in quality as it was situated inside the park. I was wrong as the carbonara and the drinks were both really good. We even stayed for second round of homemade lemonade as it was so good. I recommend visiting this place if thirsty or in need of lunch

If you are walking through Singapore's Botanical Gardens then its well worth stopping off at Bee's Knees for a beverage or two. On arrival (myself with two dogs) we were made most welcome - of course outside seating with dogs in tow, but comfortable surroundings, water bowls for the mutts and a very pleasant coffee. The staff were extremely friendly, happy to talk you through the menu, unfortunately no time to sample the delights on offer but for sure we will be back for breakfast for coffee and croissants, and for that early evening dog walk its looks like a great place to stop for that a well earned sun-downer! Thanks for the warm welcome - see you soon Ia

Went there twice for a high tea. Their truffle pizza was nice and wifi there is smooth and good. Love their berries delight and would go again next time and try out their other dishes.

Great friendly service and a great outdoor setting. The menu and food are good, it does get quiet busy so bring the paper and just sit and enjoy the surroundings.They have opened to pets which is also great. Enjoy some time here over the weekend.

Came to visit the gardens. Stopped here for a snack. Amazing granola and yogurt. They have a wide range of options. Perfect to stop, recharge and go.

Stopped here after visiting the Orchids in the Botanic Gardens. A welcome pit stop for refreshments.

I visited this place after a walk around the Botanical Gardens. The place seemed clean, the staff were helpful and friendly and the menu looked reasonably priced and offered a variety of dishes but I was not eating at that point. The coffee was good and service good. There was a fair contingent of mothers and babies, so I guessed ths restaurant caters well for them. Quite a few of the women had Asian Nannies pushng their children around for them. The disgraceful way one or two of them spoke down to their Nannies made me want to say something, but I thought better of it

I had a late lunch after the rain at Bee's Knees with my children today. Unlike mornings when it is usually busy, it was lovely and quiet and had relaxed ambience. We were all very impressed by the quality of food in their kid's menu - For $18, they got a choice of pasta (penne bolognese or spaghetti carbonara, all freshly made sauces), choice of freshly squeezed full-sized juice (apple, orange, watermelon or calamansi, totally fresh instead of out of a bottle or packet), smiley potatoes and a generous packet of 4 scrumptious full-sized Chocolate chip cookies! "Best kid's menu ever!" exclaimed the happy and discerning little diners! It is great to find a place which provides quality food not only to the grown-ups but also to discerning little diners.My favourite was the Morrocan Salad with falafel, dates, pumpkin and cous cous. My older son had the Truffle Carbonara Pizza which was so delicious that he couldn't leave any of it to waste! Another lovely thing about Bee's Knees is that we could go for a stroll in the lush Botanic Gardens after our meal. We will definitely be back

This restaurant has the best venue as this place really needed a place to eat. Great concept. However, food was so-so. Great children's choice with the unique smiley fries. Waffles / Salad / pasta and pizzas - you decide if you like the menu. The pasta I had was average - the truffle taste/smell in the carbonara was not strong enough. The pasta in the lamb ragout was perfect but the sauce was not. Drinks menu was goo

We went here the other day as we live locally, we ordered omelettes when they came still cooking and sizzling on very hot cast iron skillets the waiting staff lifted them over my child's pushchair to put them on the table. If he has dropped one my baby would have been badly burnt. The omelettes were rubbery and badly over cooked and carried on cooking in the skillet. There was no food check made by staff and I have feedback but the staff were not interested. Serving the mocha in a small glass meant I couldn't drink it until it had cooled as the glass was too hot to touch. It's aLovely venue and location just needs a lot of work to improve food quality and service

Nice addition to the North part of the Botanical Garden close to Jacob Ballads Children's Garden too, which is great. Salads, Sandwiches, Pizza and Pasta were fresh and flavourful. Acknowledging how busy they are they have gotten smart about how to place an order. Order before u find a seat and service is fast once the order is placed. Only dishes I would not recommend are the salted caramel shake and the churros. Lots of other places offer a better version of those.

Great new option inside the Garden. As it is new it is VERY popular with nearby families and therefore loud and busy with dogs and kids, especially during weekend breakfast hours. Time your stop accordingly. Menu's are placed on the service stand. Grab one and seat yourself before ordering at the window. Food is then served to your table. If you see an opportunity to order without a long queue grab it as the wait to order can get very long. But once ordered food came reasonably quickly. Although it's hectic you are sitting right in the middle of the renowned Singapore Botanic Gardens. I had Slow Cooked Eggs which meant barely cooked at all. (For me it was a non-starter). I'd go for the open omelet next time which is served in a small cast iron pan. Husband ordered a croissant sandwich which was yummy but not filling so he ordered a second one. The coffees were excellent and the baked goods looked very fresh. They had a good mix of local flavors like pandan & kaya but also chocolate, etc. Hopefully when the novelty wears off it will be a bit less hectic as for me sitting in the Botanic Gardens having coffee begs for calm. It would help if they added rubber stoppers to the legs of the metal chairs outside to help with them loudly and constantly scraping along the pavement.  Good food, good service, beautiful surrounds and hectic environment. They are also open for dinner
