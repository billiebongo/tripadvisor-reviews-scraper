Good place for a family/friends gathering. On our visit the place wasn’t crowded, and the staff were very nice and attentive! Our steamer couldn’t function properly and the staff kept helping us with a positive attitude and apologising for the inconvenience. Food was fresh, we ordered the fish, chicken, prawns and spring rolls - they were my favourite. Each pax has to pay a compulsory $2.50 for the sauce. Overall we paid about $35 each for a healthy meal

Had a family lunch at Steambox and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was a unique experience as traditionally food is either boiled (for steamboat) or BBQ (for Mookata). So unique to have food steamed , somehow weirdly felt I was having a 'healthier' meal. Staff were efficient and friendly. We order pork ribs & century egg porridge and also several other dishes for steaming. So at the start the staff placed the porridge ingredients of uncooked rice/raw ribs/century egg and other seasoning into the large pot underneath the steaming tray. She then replaces the steaming tray over the top of the pot and we proceeded to steam our dishes at the top layer. The juices of the cooking food will then drip into the large pot underneath making the porridge absolutely heavenly! Steaming is controlled by pressing the timer buttons at the side of the pot, how much time to required to steam each dish is based on the color plates in which the raw food is served in. i.e. green plate is 3mins or white plate is 2mins. So once the buzzer goes off to indicate the end of steaming, you can then open the cover to eat! We took time to chit chat whilst waiting for the food to cook. I will totally recommend the signature chicken pieces with goji berries which was very well marinated and fresh. There is a large variety of meats / seafoods / veggies to choose from. Total spend was $140 for 4Adults+1Child but we were totally stuffed. They also offer a weekday lunch specials at $12.80++ per pax.

Brought friends here for a simple lunch and ended up paying for an expensive meal. The prices for the beverages are quite atrocious. $3.20 for a coke, $3.80 for a Chrysanthemum tea and they even charge you for the condiment ($2.50). One can get pretty steamed up after such a meal

Food here is extremely fresh and tasty. Liked it so much that i came back here twice in 2 weeks. You steam your food over rice, which turns into porridge by the end of the meal - all the juices from the seafood, meats and vegetables drip into the porridge which serve to flavor it so well.Service is impeccable and i suspect the restaurant comes from Taiwan, which has Japaneseque service culture. Order the fresh barramundi fish (SGD$18) and bring friends. You wont regret it. Budget approx $40 per pax.

This restaurant serves an average range of type of food for steaming. Something close to Captain K but it's not a multi-layer version. The fish and meat are very tender and fresh. You can chose a different type of porridge that will be cook at the base while we concurrently steam the rest of the food. After all the food are done the porridge will be the last to eat. The porridge is so sweet and flavourful. Service is not bad but the only thing that I wasn't happy was they tend to rush you off after the meal (even when there are tables available and restaurant is not full).

I was a little hesitant entering this restaurant at first, because it seemed rather expensive, and I was unsure if the portion of food would actually be enough for the two of us.However, as I entered, the service was really good and the service staff explained how the whole process worked as it was our first time - basically, we had to choose a porridge base, then the other ingredients which would be steamed on top as the porridge was cooked.Do note that there is a condiment charge if you want to take any condiments. The food is very fresh and very tasty, and for those who are more concerned about their health, this place is a good option too since the food is all steamed. There aren't too many selections of food, but it is definitely enough to choose from - fish, chicken, pork, mushrooms, dim sum, vegetables, seafood...I would definitely come back here again, just with more people so as to order more dishes and to share costs
