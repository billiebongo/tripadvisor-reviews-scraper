As usual a very nice meal, excellent service, the only criticism was that this time the music seemed a bit loud
4
Wide range of delicious food, nice ambiance, very attentive & friendly staff.
A little pricey though.
4
Serves good steak at a reasonable price. Ambience is good too. Rmb to make reservation on weekends to prevent dissappointment.
5
Had the ribeye, it was really good! Service was great too and starters were served before the mains.
4
Good food and good service. Will definitely be back for the ribeye steak. Seating indoors was a bit cramped. Outdoors was much better.

Initial impressions coloured by unwelcoming greeter with more of a scowl than a pleasant disposition.Bossy , sit there type.. personally I would walk out of a place given that sort of welcome..however was with family who assured me that despite unpromising start the food would compensate.. Frankly no.. it was fine but not in anyway memorable.. I should have acted on my first impression and left

Even though we live in the heart of Katong, with so many good eateries around, whenever we feel like a good meal, we will always head to The Chop House in I12 Katong Mall.The staff there always make us feel very welcome and the ambience in this restaurant just have the right feeling to a casual dining.My favourite main course there without doubt is the BERKSHIRE PORK CHOP. It is cooked to perfection with their in house sauce. It comes with green apple and fennel salad and I would always request for an extra side because it really compliments the pork chop.My partner will always go for one of the fish main course, either the crispy skin salmon or the barramundi, and as always, cooked to perfection.Sometimes, when I am really hungry, I would order the starter, crispy pork belly in mantou (chinese bun), and I have to admit, I don't want to share this as one order has only 3 pieces of these heavenly pork belly in a bun and it is really yummy!This restaurant is apparently famous for their steak but I do not take beef, so I cannot comment on it but I always see other diners having either the rib eye steaks, tenderloins or sirloins so I believe they must be good!And if I still have some space in my stomach, I would always order the Sago Gula Melaka Chilled sago pudding with creamy coconut milk and gula melaka ice cream topped with pistachios. Just remember to ask for extra Gula Melaka because this is what make this dessert so delicious!They also have a great variety of wine and whenever in doubt, just ask for the manager, Jack, who will recommend you a good bottle to pair with your meal.The assistant manager, Miss Cristina, is always smiling and cheerful (and not to mention, easy on the eyes, even though I am of the same gender) and whenever she is on duty, you know that you are in good hands,The supervisor, Felix, whom I found out is from the Philippines, is just so very friendly and easy going and will always check that your meals are cooked to our liking.All in all, this is great place to go if you are just a couple, a few friends out having a gathering or a family dinner

Was there for a birthday celebration. Steak was beautifully cooked and served promptly. Portion a little smaller but doesnâ€™t bother me. Service was great too. Loved the amarone bottle . Staff were very attentive. The only tip is for staff to watch when it is a good time to interrupt. Because we were in a pretty intense discussions and were interrupted a few times. Anyway very pleased. Will be bac

After a long hiatus away from The Chop House due to continued bad service for over 2 years, a year later we decided to return. Much to our surprise there were many new faces - smiling faces I might add, that were were friendly, attentive & willing to serve us! A far cry from previously having to wave our hands about for service only to be met with disinterested staff with lacklustre attitudes. The food is tasty as always, but now we'll be back on a more regular basis because the service has improved!

Visited the Chop House at 112 Katong for dinner with my friend on 18 January 2018. We arrived at 7pm and as the restaurant was pretty empty, we were able to choose exactly where we prefer to be seated - the dinner crowds started flowing in from 8pm. We chose the alfresco area, which overlooked the Katong Road but was still cozy and comfortable.We ordered iberico ham and mussel soup as our starters and they were to die for. Soup was creamy but not thick and the iberico ham was delicious. Our mains were the ribeye steaks and they were fresh and done to how you would like your steak to be done.The service crew was very attentive but not intrusive. They were polite and tries to make everyone feels at home, striking friendly conversation and showing concern on our dining experience - my friend who tends to have a saltier palate requested for salt and immediately, the service staff asked if there was anything wrong with the steak, which they could correct it.Prices of the food are between average to above average pricing and drink price is the standard industry pricing - cocktail at S$16 per glass.Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and would go back if I am around the vicinity
5
Came here just for the mac&cheese side as I heard it was very good. Could eat it on its own. Had sirloin steak which was tasty. Service staff were very friendly too!
4
We wanted to be greedy & order 2 platters but was kindly advised by the friendly staff that 1 platter was quiet sufficient for our table of 4. Thanks much for the great advice! Food was great with tasty meats & sides.
3
Nice food and good service. Sides dishes Mac & Cheese and Truffle potatoes salad very nice. Like the steak condiments too :)
4
Our reservation request was met, despite booking via Chope. Server in charge of our table zone was friendly and polite. Food menu variety's good, likewise for drinks.
3
Decent quality steaks but not much to shout about - maybe a tad better than Aston’s but you do pay up for it. They do sell wines at good value for takeaway but pity they charge $35 corkage to drink it on the premise.
4
The food is good with a wide variety for everyone in the family. Love the steak and side dishes! Prompt and excellent service.
3
The food was great but the service really need more improvement in every way..
Just make sure come early.
4
Steaks are well prepared.
Comes with an onion pickle, a hot chilly - ask for it as they sometimes forget.
Great ambience and great monitors!

I've always wanted to try this place and since i was on my own i thought kets give it a go. First impressions were ok, although then i was asked to move seats to make way for a bigger group, although why they disnt just join the other tables instead of moving me i have no idea. Not off to a good start. I ordered the ribeye and while it was cooked well and tasted good it was the smallest ribeye i have ever been served in a restaurant. Service was ok, although the waiters seemed to be a little confused and brought me the bill instead of my meal at one stage. I dont know if i will go back here or not, it was just ok for me.
5
Brought my staff out for a meal and they thoroughly enjoyed the food. Service was beyond excellent. Waiting time for the platter was a bit long but well worth the wait. The meat on the pork knuckle and pork ribs was so tender and just fell off the bone. Simply deeelicious
3
Service staff is excellent but quality and price of food needs to be improved. The steak in the sharing combo was dry and too well done instead of medium well. Burrata was up to par.
4
If you live on the East coast, you must try this restaurant. Conveniently located and serve great steaks. The service is quick and unassuming. All the things that one would like in a local neighborhood restaurant. Menu is great with lots of chices.
4
Sat outside with a group, service was excellent, drinks were very good. A few people has some small bites, but mostly drinks. Outside was pleasant with fans and good vibe.
5
Delicious food, great steak, vegetables were super tasty, atmosphere good, cool spot, friendly helpful staff

So much potential if they could just lift their game a bit more.The Chop House has a fantastic ambiance and you can tell that somebody put a lot of thought and care into the design and decoration. Unfortunately, the service model there doesn't match the appearance.The food was overall acceptable but after a few days I can't remember really we ordered (which itself says something). What was memorable was the soup of the day (pumpkin) that had little pumpkin and mostly a creamy filler. When will restaurant owners ever learn that providing cheap, low-taste food is not the way to deliver a lunch-time special?Service was good... when people were paying attention. The girl that served us had a great manner but after that it was a luck who you managed to flag down (I say flag down literally, because nobody was really paying attention to the tables even with just a handful of customers in the mid afternoon.The real low point for me was seeing a 50 cent charge for a glass of water.... because that's going to make me want to visit again and tell friends about how great the place is.My advice to the owner: you've got good staff train them to pay better attention to customers, don't cut so many corners on the food quality even if you are trying for a cheap lunch time eat. Do that and I can see your reviews and patronage turning around
5
We ordered the crispy salmon, truffle fries and mac n cheese. The fries and mac n cheese were really fantastic - large portions for an excellent price. While the salmon was extremely delicious, I felt that there could have been more on the plate as it cost $28
5
If you’re wondering if you should eat here: you should eat here.If you’re wondering what to have if you haven’t been here before, you should have the Patty Melt, medium-rare.Every time I’ve eaten here the food has been delicious, the service friendly, and the belly too full afterward for dessert. Eat some for me
1
Steaks were overcooked. Oysters were not fresh. Informed the waiter but we just got a blank look. Had to ask for ice water from 3 different waiters to finally get it. Forgot our sides. No apologies for any of the mishaps. A restaurant staff or cook making an error is one thing but being completely oblivious to it is another level altogether. Ruined my date, wont go back ever

Been to this restaurant a few times since they opened in the neighbourhood. Food is usually OK but service is always lacking. This time around the food standard seemed to take a beating too. I have always had the USDA rib eye there as it is a really good steak. But not this time, It lacked any flavour. It wasnt the seasoning but just bland flavour. Asked one of the staff and they said they had recently changed the USDA beef they were buying. The meat was juicy and tender but is just bland with no flavours. The quessadillas was also soggy and slimmy. Service has always been a pain in this place. If you are seated outside it is always an effort to get attention even though you can see staff just standing inside and fooling around. There seems to be a complete lack of concern sometimes. Its sad because the pricing is reasonable and without a doubt still serves good food compared to other options around. I hope they can fix the USDA prime and I will continue to come despite of the regular bad service
3
Pricey food that was just above average in quality but yet with small portions (can easily finish the platter for 2). Service staff was friendly but a little slow even though place was only half full (only 1 staff taking orders, rest were just standing around).
4
We are pleased with the quality of the food. We ordered sausage platter, beef and lamp rack. The service is also good. I will come back again as long as the quality remains or better.
5
Fantastic food, good service staff, nice ambience. Will recommend friends and be back again to try out the other dishes. :)
5
Friends from overseas wanted to catch up with a few local friends - really impressed with the friendly staff, and the menu had enough variety of drinks and food to choose from. We enjoyed all the food that we ordered. A place worth re-visiting.
5
Nice ambience with spacious seatings both indoor and outdoor. Service is very good. The food quality is very good and the taste is just right for the tenderlion steak, lamb shank, pork chop and the baby backs. The Sago Gula Malacca dessert is a must try.
4
Good food & drinks, great customer service. Great place to chill especially outdoor area. Tables & chairs well spread out, not cramp. Will go back there again :) Will be great if the menu are more details cos we wasted a basket of fries cos our main comes with additional basket of fries.

It's a nice place and more often than not you're going to leave satisfied, but it's a bit too expensive for what it is. Everything just feels like it's 10% more than it should be for the quality of food and the random service.The burgers are good, but a bit greasy, the roast pork is tasty but tiny. The mussels promised so much, but having only received a small bowl of 11, I had to laugh and question a member of staff about it, who simply didn't care. The pork chop was good, hearty fare, but in excess of $30, again I couldn't help feeling over charged. Unfortunately the staff are hit and miss as well. Management are friendly, looking to make a real go of it and improve things where possible, but some of the wait staff would rather be anywhere else than at work, and this can be frustrating. I'm not after much in a place like this, but at least keep an eye out for the time to take the order.The Chop House should be a lot better, but instead it is average, and that is a shame

My wife enjoys good steak and we think we have found our steak place! She ordered the tenderloin(medium) and there were 4 of us. We ordered the Pork rib platter and the Meat/sausage platter. As well as pumpkin soup and the mashed potatoes. The pumpkin soup was perfect, creamy, tasty. The tenderloin for my wife disappeared under our noses before we could even look up! yes, she said it was delicious! The pork ribs fell off the bone and the seasoning was just right. The meat platter had a tenderloin, 2 lamb chops and 2 types of sausages. All were cooked just nice. the lamb chops were very good, and the meat was cooked just right. No smell on the lamb, the quality of the meats were very good. the only item that could have been better were the greens that came with the orders. it could have been a better choice of greens with maybe a light dressing. The service was great. Our waiter, Felix was great. Knowledgeable and friendly.

Went there for my birthday with my parents and my Wife and 2 kids, and it was fantastic. So good in fact, that my Wife and I took a sneaky day off for lunch together at the Chop house again (but the VivoCity one instead of the Katong one) the very next day. We just couldn't stop thinking about that beautiful juicy steak. FOODThe steaks were juicy and delicious. Some of the best I've tasted. They come with some of the most phenomenal homemade sauces.... I initial asked for English mustard but the sauces were so delicious I didn't even bother. In fact, the steak was so tasty on it's own I was torn between just eating it plain or with the accompanying sauces!I didn't really enjoy the seafood platter, though the squid was very nice. The fresh oysters our server recommended was excellent. The churros dessert we had was a bit too oily for me (I think they rushed it - the oil wasn't hot enough perhaps). My only gripe was that they were not kept abreast of what ran out in the kitchen. The kitchen staff need to communicate this much better and inform floor staff when things are low, and when they go "86". This will help mitigate customers expectations and prevent disappointment (one of the reviewers here complained about ordering a dessert and being told almost 15 minutes later that there wasn't any left - I experienced the same thing).SERVICE/ AMBIENCEThe service at I12 was fantastic. The lady at the front desk was a breath of fresh air - friendly, polite, efficient, helpful. We felt welcome almost immediately. Staff were quick to make recommendations, and chit chat, and check up on our meal. I loved that we had this area just beside the main door - it was cozier and posher looking than the seating arrangements further inside. They do, however have a lovely al fresco area on the balcony.OVERALLI highly recommend chop house at Katong. On a side note, I'd not recommend going for lunch at the VivoCity outlet - the staff there were kind of dull and uninterested, and the steaks were not nearly as good quality. The Katong branch is far superior and well run. Looking forward to my next visit

Service was on point and food was great. particularly enjoyed the mixed grilled platter and mussels mariniere.
5
Here for my husband's birthday treat this evening and we were very pleased with not only the chef's skills but also the service provided. Extra mile was given by this service crew who was wearing green tonight. He was attentive to us as well as to other diners. Extra effort given to his initiative to surprise my husband with a brownie and a birthday candle without customers request. Thumbs up for team effort in The Chop House Katong
4
Love the lunch sets that comes with nachos, soup or salad. Quite satisfied with the fish and chips and pork chop.
4
We ordered the rib eye and it was super delicious. Truffle fries and calamari were so good! We enjoyed our meal very much.
4
We visited for Mother's Day celebration and had the meat platter. Steak and lamb chops were tasty and cooked well, would have preferred less spicy sausages.Being able to order child portions was much appreciated as well.Service was great, very attentiv

Stumbled across this place recently while having a business lunch meeting. Both myself (Australian) and my Singaporean friend were so glad we found The chop House . I love Asian food , but some times i just crave a good western meal ......Which can be hard to find in Singapore, as it always seems to be this Singaporean fusion with most western food places, which makes for some strange tastes. We both had the lunch time set , my friend having the salad and i had the nachos , both were great.....I could of eaten the Nachos as a main , it was so good. i had the steak sandwich and my friend had the chicken burger.......both we large and first class , we both were very satisfied . The beer list was also very good , not huge , but it covered all bases, something for everyone.The service was fantastic , it is always good to have a laugh and joke with waiters. The decor is great , very modern and funky , loads of room , to truly relax as you eat. The open kitchen was on show for all to see being modern and pristine .We both agreed we would make the effort to eat here again , even thou it is a little out of the way for me from Kovan, it is worth the trip

Like the food, not the service.4th time here last night. Had not made a reservation. The waitress who attended to us noted that, and said she would check on her available tables before seating us. Not just a few seconds later did 2 Caucasian men arrive with no prior reservations as well, did she lead them to the back of the restaurant, to their choice seats. We considered leaving at that moment, but were pretty much still in shock, before she came to us and said there were tables at the back as well if we'd like. The Caucasian men were innocent parties in the incident. But it is people like the waitress cited about, that create unnecessary misunderstandings and rift through their differentiated service standards, (and the kicker...) on their own fellow Singaporeans.Once seated, we were served by another waiter. We ordered the steaks, broccoli and sweet potato fries sides, and red wine - food was decent, hence our 4th time here.But it would probably be a long while before the faded memory of the incident with the waitress will take us back here again
4
Service from the staffs was good. Food portion for the pork ribs is good to shared by two, and all the foods served are hot
4
We ordered a lamb chop, pork chop and chicken furjita and a side french fries. The Australian lamb chop is very nicely done and so do the pork chop. Chicken furjita is also very juicy. French fries is crispy but portion is too small for the price. All mains comes with too small portion of side..if not it will be more portioned with the main. Overall nice food
3
Ordered the seafood platter and afew sides. The food was quite okay, pretty tasty. However the portion was quite small, not very justified for the price. Hope the portion can be bigger
3
Burrata v small portion. Staffs doesn't pay atterntion to what u say. Asked for drinking water and MENU. Had wanted to order dessert.. Staff came back with ONLY the water. Asked another staff for the menu again. Staff came back with the BILL...! Ordered Apple Crumble Pie, was told not available after 5mins, then did the staff decided to inform me that 3 other desserts from the menu were not available as well. Would it have been better if I was inform of the dessert availability when I ask for the dessert menu ? The only saving grace was the burger main course. Tenderloin was good but could have served with a little more salad. The tenderloin comes with a side of watercress salad which was quite a miserable portion.
5
Food was really good. Service was a bit hit and miss but they were friendly so that made up for it will go again
4
The atmosphere was lovely, and I loved the decorations there. One thing to note is that the portions might be a bit small for sharing.
5
Heard so much about their steak from friends, and it was definitely true to the hype. We also ordered seafood which was not bad but wasn't anything worth raving about
4
The steaks are good quality and yummy. Enjoyed the food and it was worth the money. The service could be slightly faster but it's overall pretty good.
4
Stopped in for a bit after eating at starkers round the corner. This was far better, better prices, better service and better food! The burger was excellent perfectly cooked and very tasty. Complimented by an excellent shake.
4
Attentive waiters who gave good suggestions on their food selections. Food is good, done to our request.
5
First time dining at The Chop House and I was impressed by the food and service levels at I12 Katong restaurant. We had the mussels for appetisers which was delicious not too creamy and the Steak was very well cooked to our preferred doneness. Definitely will visit The Chop House for steak again next time :
5
I have been to The Chop House a lot and every time I have been food has been delicious and the staff are very attentive. Definitely one of my favourite places for a relaxed dinner.
2
I have been to Chop House on numerous occasions with both my husband & with friends. Its only saving grace is the delicious food & decent wine & my favourite mashed potato ever! Compliments to the chef! However, the waitstaff are the most inattentive lot I have come across. You should not have to be getting up or waving frantically to have your order taken or ask where your drinks are after your meals appear first, when the whole bunch of staff are standing idle chit chatting with each other. They appear to not see you at all! This has happened on EVERY occasion that we have been there. I don't know if it is a top-down thing stemming from poor management, but it reflects so poorly on the restaurant considering the food is great & the atmosphere is nice. I'd be here every week bringing friends if the service were top notch, but it's disappointing
4
had it at vivo, then had it again at I12 cos i knew i'd be guaranteed a good meal without burning a hole in my pocket. wasn't disappointed at all. would pick I12 over vivo simply cos its less crowded but food at both outlets are consisten
5
I only came for drinks on the ridiculously good value 'ladies night' but was so impressed by the hospitable atmosphere created by Jack and his team that I will come back for food as well soon. My companions were regulars and raved about the food. This is one of the few places in Singapore where you felt like they actually wanted the customers to have a good time and stay as long as possible. Most places are either neutral or actively seem to want you to leave, even if it's only 9.30-10pm which is hardly fun. Not here, and it comes from the manager's own hands-on, welcoming attitude. Great night
5
Jack the restaurant manager is excellent! Jacknis an excellent example of how restaurant service should be provided. The food is great and cooked as requested (burger well done).Will be back...
4
Booked a table for family lunch of 6. Generous portions, good quality. Nice ambience, attentive staff
4
Food was excellent, best fish I have had in Singapore. Service was both friendly and professional. Meal and drinks were very good value for money. I will definitely go again
5
Always go there with a couple of friends. It's just an easy very friendly place to go where food is great! There is a happy hour for martinis, staff is very helpful and friendly. Recommend the chicken, pork, burrata. Even would go with family and kids.
5
Yeup. I was mesmerized by the cute service staff. She was looking so prim and proper and yet a bit of local flavour to her facial and tone of voice. She enticed me to step into this chop house and I was chopped from the start.Order quite a bit of meats and many other delights.But she was an upselling girl and I ended up with (many) drinks on my table and a 3-figure bill was to be expected for my party of 5.But the meal was great and the food was fresh. But she, she is the reason to return again. Thank you. (damn i didn't see your name tag so no names will be mentioned here. next time, i will be more observant. and maybe you will be ready to me my baby.
5
Visited their new Katong outlet to celebrate my mom's birthday and it was a pretty damn good night out. Their mushroom garlic toast and the coconut brioche toast were super yummy! We also had the calamari, garlic prawns, sirloin and tenderloin which did not disappoint for their quality. Service was wonderful (the staff were Singaporeans which proved that we can achieve a high service standard!). Can't wait to go back and try something different there, esp with the cool vibes from their decor.
4
I have travelled to Singapore from Sydney many times and I always find having lunch at The Chop House in Katong a great place to chill out with my local friends. This last time I had a long relaxing girlie lunch, ordered the barramundi and my friend the Eye fillet, it was perfection! To indulge we also ordered the Mac N Chees,Spinach cream and the truffle Chips were TO DIE FOR!! The staff is always very welcoming and helpful. The Manager Jack is a great wine connoisseur always eager to recommend the right wine to go with the food! Always a bonus. Can't wait to go back

Chose this restaurant as it was within walking distance from were my Son and daughter in law, I wanted a good steak. On arrival we asked for a table outside, and both my son and I were ready for a pint of beer, asked the waitress to bring some beer before we ordered, our meal, asked three times, before it arrived, the place was not very busy so no excuse, we then ordered our meal, all chose starters, and mains, both the other two got there starter alas, mine did not arrive, but fun and games, the waitress brought the wine that we had ordered, almost turned it upside down trying to open it using a waiters friend cork screw she had no idea, I asked if that I could show her how, wine was then poured into frosted glasses were you could see the wine colour, I tasted it and said to the other the leave it the wine is corked, smelt very musty, called over the girl who looked in charge and asked to change the bottle, this done same performance with the cork screw, but the wine was ok.next thing that happened the mains arrived, still no starter for me? Then it arrived after the mains, not good communication with the staff, on speaking to the girl in charge all she could say was that all the staff were new. Steaks were good but cold.The place did not leave a good impression
1
I just had the worst service I've ever experienced in here. A very rude French waitress asked me if I had a reservation (in a near empty restaurant) then sneered at me for asking to sit outside. We were served by 3 different staff who didn't seem to know how to greet a customer, or how to provide basics such as a baby chair. We had to ask repeatedly for water and cups for the children. The waiting staff are inept and rude. The food was nice enough but I would not recommend this place as the staff are so awful. I saw a couple waving frantically at the waiter who was staring blankly around the near empty room while holding two beers... What really topped it off was the 10% service charge they added to the bill that we were obliged to pay (we googled it!). The only time they came promptly was once they'd (eventually) brought the bill... then they came 3 times in a minute to check I'd paid! One waitress even came and swooped it off the table before I'd had a chance to get my purse out.Avoid
4
We were looking for a good burger joint and chanced upon this place at I12 in Katong. It was quite crowded and service was very slow but fortunately, the burgers were worth the wait. Except for the one young lady who came to check if everything was all right, the remaining service staff who were all males were not very attentive. The truffle fries were also good. If service was faster and better, I would have given it an excellent rating.
5
Went to this restaurant on the spare of the moment. Good service, great food and especially the starters. I have steak and it was cooked to perfection.
5
We had an amazing dinner after tiring office day .. Jeanette recommended for us a special cut ... Best piece of steak I tasted
(Check the pics ) she brought for us first to take pic and then cut for us :)
3
Comparatively uninspired, the cuisine was passable however devoid of pertinent pungency which leaves the palate somewhat wanting.. Mediocre.
4
The outlet at I12 Katong has a smaller menu selection. And maybe slightly cheaper? The quality of food is there. Just that the servers are less attentive.
4
The food was very good and service was excellent. The staff was willing to accommodate some changes to the menu as per our requirement. Highly recommended restaurant. Cheers Vani

Visited twice - service need to be improved as the service staff are unfriendly and inattentive. First visit with a group celebrating a friend birthday, brought a cake along but been told by a staff the restaurant will charge ‘cakeage’, where the restaurant did not offer whole cake for sale, we tried to reason out and the manager agreed to grant an exception on this occasion.2nd visit with an oversea friend on a weekday – we asked for a table for 2, led by the service staff to a table just next to / near the food servicing area, as the given table was busy and noisy, we asked for a quieter corner (so that we could catch up), note that the restaurant was not packed, and there are few quieter corner or table they could offer, BUT service staff rejected up front said he couldn’t arrange another table for us and need us to take up the table assigned, after we INSIST for another table, then only he unwillingly lead us to a quieter table. Feel that the service staff need to be bit more flexible and to respect customer needs.Food was fair by far – but bear in mind that there are loads of similar restaurants in the same neighborhood
4
We also had the Mixed Seafood Grill for 2 $58++, with a general servings of Salmon, Prawns, Calamari and Mussels stuffed with herbs and breadcrumbs served with roasted tomatoes and a zesty parsley salsa.For me, I enjoyed the pasta very much. Tagliatelle with Mussels $20++, tossed in a rich spiced tomato broth.The Chop House chill and laidback environment is definitely a good place for a gathering with loved ones, catch a football match on the 80-inch TV screen, or stay out till midnight for beers and good food.Read more about my dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

We came here a few days ago and loved it so much we came back!This place knows how to cook steak - mine was perfectly blu and my wife's perfectly medium (pink in the middle an no blood - it's amazing how many places cannot cook that).The sides were great especially the mashed potato - my wife is Welsh, mash is her favourite and she highly rates their offering!The staff are superb especially Jack - really good service and with a smile. If you like meat then this is the East Coats Road place to come!

Decided to only write a review after my 3rd visit to try and be fair and impartial but now after visiting 3 times and with different sets of friends each time we have come to an honest collective agreement that the service at this place needs huge improvementThe ambience of the restaurant is nice and inviting and I really like the outside dining area which speaks well of the design layout of this restaurantThe food is good but not spectacular, I enjoyed the burgers and fish dishes and they have a nice selection of beerNow for the service, this scene is getting repetitive in Singapore and it's time we citizens let people know and not keep quiet and bearing with it when the service is a huge letdownRestaurants owned by foreigners are sprouting up all over Singapore where their prices are not cheap manned by mostly foreign staff who take the place of Singaporeans who need a job, Chop house is no different manned by very snooty foreign staff who only smile and treat Caucasians like gods, I start with the bartender who acts like he is the Jesus Christ of the bartending scene, behaving like a god behind the bar counter forgetting that he is there to serve customers graciously and not for customers to go on their knees in awe and pray to him! Asians there are treated with disdain and even shows in their faces, Asians pay the same amount as the foreigners and mr chop house owner take note please if your staff are only keen to serve foreigners the word will spread around and lets see how Long you can survive just on foreigner patronageVery sad to say the worst staff of all is the Chinese lady a very slim lady whom I take is maybe the assistant manager as she is always rubbing shoulders with the boss, she knows who I am referring to, Asians beware when you are attended by her or you call for her attention, she once her back is turned actually has a look of total disgust and on all 3 times I was there she was rude and sacarstic and passed all sorts of remarks within earshot of the tables, she is always at the front of the open kitchen barking orders and only one word can describe her demeanour and that's disgusting! The two best staff by far are the 2 most junior, one a short Chinese looking guy and the other a young Chinese lady, they were both so pleasant and Super hardworking, the young gal always had a smile and constantly topped up water without being askedThey far outshined their more senior counterparts, the ministry of manpower has urged Singaporeans to name restaurants where hardly Singaporeans are employed as it breaches employment laws and my friends are so fed up with the service that they are seriously considering doing soThe owner will probably not bother to reply or reply defending that lady Friend of hisAll I can say is for the prices you charge we are not asking to be treated like kings but a little sincere decency will do, Asians beware honestly there are many other restaurants nearby who treat you with a little more respect nearby just try wine connection next door and compare and see if I am correct with my view

On Tuesday 21 June 2016, I decided to pay a visit to The Chop House under the Wooloomooloo Group for dinner at about 7pm and was surprised to see that there were four floor staffs, three in the kitchen crew and a manager for a seating capacity area of 125. Don't get me wrong, it is an extremely good thing to have more than less staff from a customer's point of view as service and attention is quick! However, not all service staffs are as friendly as others. Food-wise, we had the Seafood Grill Platter (for two) and the BBC - BBQ burger at $58 and $29 respectively. The waiting time for the platter took about 15 minutes to arrive and the burger was served in halves as we were sharing it as well. For the platter, the garlic white wine butter sauce was a tad too bland but compliments go to the medium done salmon (I think you can choose medium or medium well) and the flavourful herbed calamari. However, the portion could serve either for one as a main or as a side to share. The burger arrived shortly and we requested for medium rare for the patty. However, my dining companion felt like it was more rare than what we requested. Either way, the meat wasn't chewy and it was all mushy. Not many people may appreciate it but I definitely loved it! I felt like they could have been a little more generous with the bacon, lettuce and onions though! To end the dinner, we had the Hot Chocolate Brownie ($8) and changed the ice cream to dark chocolate instead as I'm not a big fan of vanilla. The pairing was definitely good and not too sweet.Despite the fairly good food served and quick service, it was a bit of a downer when we had to wait for more than 15 minutes for our change despite the restaurant not fully occupied and many staffs. I would definitely visit this place again but maybe only for their desserts

We went to this place for early dinner weeks ago. Since I using local reviews site much more these days. I forgot to review it here. Firstly when we approach the waitress who's managing the Q.. It was no Q at that time. We asked for table of 2 and she immediately said No that wouldn't be possible coz now they have too much customers and kitchen is overload. It was strange to hear that with a really grumpy face. My hubby insist that he would love to try. So, we asked to put our name on the waiting list. And left to do a bit of shopping for 20 mins and by the time we came back there was a waiter who just brought us in without any questions... Weird. - Steak quality wasn't up to par for a sister brand of Mooloomooloo. It was way below our expectations. - Crispy Skin Salmon was semi fresh.. Not much flavor in it.- Salad was good. As I said on the topic that service needed a huge improvement starting from the front to inside of restaurant. No one came by top up our glass of wine. Dirty was never remove til the end of meal. This would be the only time we travel from city center out this far by taxi for eat here. I may give it another shot at Vivo City branch though.

I have been to this new place twice so far. The first time I had grilled lamb chops as main course - portion was rather tiny with two pieces but they were very tasty. The second time I had the crispy skin salmon which was more generous in portion, and a large apple rocket salad plus mussel soup. Prices here are reasonable with mains around $20-$28 and salads around $6, and standards are high. Ambience is nice and you can sit indoors or outdoors. Service is also pretty good.

Firstly, I love the Chop House in Vivocity. Good food and great service too. The service staff are more upbeat and that in itself is a treat.Now, we keep on returning to the the Chop House at 112 because we're close approx. to it. The food is good. Have been there several times since it opened but wanted to give the staff a chance before I write this review. The service staff are not upbeat, they are rushed and they don't make you feel comfortable. They sit you down give you the menu and off they go and take the longest time to take your drink order. Its hard to get their attention. So I think that is something the restaurant manager have to manage better. Food is good. I go back for the steaks but last night I had the fried barramundi. Very nice indeed. So guys, get your act together. Check and see what the guys at Vivo have and hopefully replicate the enthusiasm and their friendliness. Yes, I'll be back

We had lunch on a weekday and the restaurant was relatively busy with not many tables to spare which is a good sign. The food was good and the service relatively quick except that it took us quite a while to get our beers. The service staff seemed a bit inexperienced but they made up for it by being friendly. We had the burrata for appetiser, which was good, but the tomatoes was cut way to thick for my liking (preference of course). I had the tenderloin with sides of mashed potatoes and creamy spinach for my main and the steak was cooked very well. The only complaint about that dish was the bearnaise had no flavour at all. All in all it was a good meal and I will be bac

Reading the 10 reviews was like "who would I believe?" They were at the extremes but I chose to believe the good reviews and went to find out myself. Well, my family and friends (13 of us) were not disappointed except that the total bill came to about $700. It is a bit pricey considering that we did not order any alcoholic drinks and only 3 ordered dessert. The service was quite good and the Indian staff (maybe the manager/supervisor) who welcomed us was very helpful and made our visit a pleasant one. He recommended us some of the appetizers which were delicious. He came to check with us whether everything was ok. The other two waitresses, one a Chinese blond was very efficient. The ambience was relaxing and homely. The food wad good. I would recommend this restaurant for a social outing or family dinner. But I will not be back soon as I have a big hole in my pocket.

Whilst only half full there was no service at all on this quiet Wednesday evening. After 15 minutes of trying to get someone's attention I eventually went to the bar and ordered my own beer and took it back outside to my table. I did want to order dinner but there were no menus and no one to even provide one. After a further 20 minutes I gave up. I paid my bill at the bar and I did explain to the manager on duty that there was no table service being offered and as a result I was forced to Disappointing as on the first visit whilst the service was slow the food was good. Unfortunately I can. It recommend the chop house unless you have a lot of patience.

Decided to try out this restaurant coz the deco really stood out, and was greeted by a warm crew member who made sure we were nicely settled in and taken care of. Our orders came without much delay and the food quality was pretty good. We were most impressed by the calamari, which had a special Mediterranean taste and its definitely worth trying. The manager also took time to make sure we were comfortably settled in and enjoying the food. Overall a good experience and kudos to the team
