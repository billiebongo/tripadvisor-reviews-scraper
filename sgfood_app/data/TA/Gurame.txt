Even if it was standard Indonesian cuisine, friendly and attentive staff made it a good experience. And gurame fish was exactly what was expected. Chicken soto, fried chicken, grilled squids,etc. were right prepared. Dessert (I forgot the name - ice with beans and small "worms") was absolutely delicious! Real value for money

The reservation was painless. 10 Adults and 8 children for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.There was the indoor option and an outdoor patio-style setting to choose from. We chose the outdoors as there was a reasonably sized lawn for restless children to walk around and enjoy the breeze and view of the sea.The food itself was standard Indonesian fare. Gurame fish, beef rendang, barbecued fish, chicken soto, friend chicken, grilled squids. It was delicious and served in a timely manner. The service was attentive - probably because it had about 20% occupancy for lunch. The service staff even suggested packing leftovers in order not to waste food. We went for the 10 pax set meal at about $420 (after tax and svc charges) which was more than the 1 adults can handle. It was still the better value option compared to going ala-carte.The downside for this restaurant is that you will need to drive or get a cab to the place. But when you get there, the reward of the location and view while dining makes it well worth it. For younger folks, grab an outdoor table by the sea for a very nice candlelit dinner.The other downside is that the restaurant does not accept ANY credit cards. Only cash or NETS. I can't wrap my head around that
