BBQ chicken drumstick is superb served with rice, curry gravy cabbages and egg omelette. Fish is slightly harder so chicken is a better option as always.

You get huge portion of rice, egg and chicken for 6 Dollars, probably one of the cheaper choices you have in the area. The taste and quality have been consistent over the years. One of my favorite local food place.

Great chicken and interestingly great squid! Get the veggies to complete the bbq experience. Tortilla made of egg is great compliment.

One of the best must try in Singapore. It's just an mrt away from Changi international airport to Orchard station. Look for the food court plaza and find this riverside indonesian bbq. It's also inexpensive food. I love it!

I often visit Riverside Indonesian BBQ's branch at Somerset 313 as it's located fairly close by. It's cheap (5.50 for the grilled chicken set), especially for Orchard Area, and tasty. If you're in the area looking for a cheap yet hearty meal, I recommend going here

For the money you cannot get better. BBQ chicken dunked into a sweet sticky delicious sauce with a serving of rice with a creamy coconut curry. Often I double up and add the fish or the squid simply out of greed not because the portions are small. If you are in the area give it a visit. But watch out... The queues can be long!

Came to try this out based on the many reviews. Was definitely not disappointed. The chicken is very juicy and flavorful. The rice comes with a curry gravy and some very sweet black sauce. They combination is divine. It is also accompanied with a quarter egg omelette. This seems to be ther only store that has a queue regardless of when you visit the food court. Highly recommen

Been here a few times but the crowd was huge that I could not queue for 45 minutes ... Today, off peak hours. I was just the third in the Q. It's worth the wait as the chicken was BBQ to perfection, juicy not dry n simply tastes so good. For $6.50 a huge piece of Maryland, rice with cabbage n egg. You can't go wrong.Added bonus, for another $1.50. Add the sotong. It's fresh .. N it's nice.Sambal on the side with anchovies ... All you can add to make your meal an even more satisfying one.It's so yummy ..... Had mine. I will be back soon

Indonesia BBQ Chicken/Fish rice which you should try whenever you're down at Plaza Sing at Singapore.The curry broth is creamy, delicious and wasn't spicy.The chicken is cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy. The BBQ sauce is a treat but the sauce is a little too sweet for my preference. This is a delicious and reasonable meal for one.If you are new to this store and uncertain what you should be ordering,go for their basic set of Set A,B or C the one that comes with the curry chicken or fish. (I usually prefer something that is less messy so I ordered the fish set)The store is located at the left hand corner next to a arcade store. You will definitely not missed it because it is usually packed with a long que.The only thing which tempers my rating to go to a 4 or 5 star is because of the cleanliness from this store.After my food came and I was really excited to eat it.Just as I was about to use the spoon and fork to dig into my meal, I caught a nasty glance of what appears to be some left over scraps of food that is still stuck at the base of the spoon. The fork and spoon isn't really well cleaned and I could still see the left over food scraps on my spoon! I feeling quite disgusted, I immediately got up from my table and had to walk back to the store for a new replacement spoon
