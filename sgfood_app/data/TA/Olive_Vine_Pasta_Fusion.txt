Lately, every time we visit S’pore, this s one of our must visit restaurants. Tonight we came with our children. I had Spaghetti Arabiata.My wife had Olive rice and chicken (they are famous with this one)My daughter had Korean Chicken with Pesto RiceMy son had Spaghetti PestoWe closed it with their amazing dessert: Cronouts Ice Cream with yummy Brownies.The food quality is really above the price that listed. We have been coming here 3x and just love the food. Ambience can be improved, but I guess while mostly their customers are the working people around the offices, people are just eating and going.Surprisingly, on Saturday evening the place was packed with young people and families. Thank God we made reservation.Really recommended to visit. I forgot to take every picture of the food we had.The great food quality that won’t break your bank!

The place is pretty cramp but the service was good. We got lost trying to locate the venue but the service staff was patient enough to direct. We ordered pasta, chicken curry, chicken porridge and a gado gado. Prices were reasonable except or the gado gado.Overall, we pretty like the food. Nice touch to add in a small piece of cake. Both chocolate cake and banana cake were nice too

Wide ranging menu. We tried the curry chicken set (value for money at $8.90 before gst, came with a drink and a slice of cake) and Korean spicy chicken ($12.90). The chicken is not as good as other korean chicken specialty restaurants like Chir Chir Chicken but still quite nice. Friendly and quick service. Will certainly eat there again

We had passed by this restaurant on several occasions on a recent trip to Singapore over Christmas. I had mentioned to my husband that we should stop here for a meal at some stage. So glad we did! The restaurant is in the basement level crossing between Marina Square and Raffles Exchange. We would pass it frequently as we were staying at Marina Mandarin Hotel. We had lunch here on Boxing Day with our 4 year old son. Extensive menu, great service and great price. Had the pork ribs and both my husband and son had pasta. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Went for lunch at this restaurant. Decided to give this place a try not because we were attracted by the food nor selection of the place, but the sheer determination of the staff. I can recall how the Filipino lady at the door used to greet potential customers when the restaurant first started, and she never gave up. The restaurant is located deep within the link between two shopping malls and there was never much of a crowd. I'm glad to see that the restaurant is still doing well.Service is quick and efficient. I got a seat within a minute or two despite the restaurant being relatively full and we were offered a four-seater. The food came soon after (about 10 minutes later) and we were almost done with our soup. Good timing on their part.Quality wise, it is slightly better than those offered in the food courts nearby, but really nothing fancy, which may be their strategy for consistency and survival. Price-wise, it is definitely lower than the restaurants nearby.All the best to this wallet-friendly little establishment

I joined two friends for a quick lunch at Olive Vine@Marina Link B1 (Marina Square) on 19 Mar ’16.As it was indeed highly resembling a fast-food outfit modus operandi (order-and-pay at cashier’s counter before seating), no service charge was imposed. There were posted notices stating that delivery of food orders was available on the “foodpanda” platform; and also that the food had no added MSG!Each of us had a “Deluxe Set Meal” comprising a main menu item, a mushroom soup, a drink (hot or cold) and a dessert. All nicely-priced, indeed!We enjoyed the strongly aromatic freshly-brewed black coffee and were also particularly delighted with the chocolate mud-cake and banana-cake as dessert options: the former was overall not too sweet with the heated cake and melted chocolate complementing well, while the latter, being somewhat moist and soft, was absolutely delicious with its good mix of fragrant banana and almond bits.We left the place impressed by the amiable and helpful staff as well

A great serving size with a great price and with great taste. Be sure to get the combo set so you can taste their awesome chocolate cake!

Foods there are not bad and top up $4 can get an executive set meal with desserts. Price is around 15-20 for executive set meal.

Service- Nothing much to say. No service charge.Food- We had sweet and sour fish. Sauce seems a tad insufficient. Suggest that hey provide a little bowl of sauce for those who like the sauce more than the crispiness of the fish. Nonya curry chix- bread slightly hard as compared to the last time that my friend was there.The reason why the food had 2 stars, my ice lemon tea tasted like it came out of their fruit punch container because of the taste. We noticed that they had 2 types of regular drinks so thought the container was mixed. Price- No service charge. have 7% gst though.Location- basement of marina square mall

Lots of places to eat in Marina Square,go down the escalators or lift to the bottom,on the right hand side is the restaurant. B1-17,that's the floor and number .Family run place,very friendly,will add foods to your meal or omit them at your request. Not expensive,but gets busy,. A must to try

A friend brought me here. She ordered marinara ($10.90), and a blueberry cheesecake ($4.90). Somehow they asked if she wants chilli in the dish, my friend said a little, and it came pretty spicy she had 3 glasses of water. Nevertheless, the marinara is very appetising. I will return for this dish without the chilli the next time. I ordered a carbonara ($8.90) and top up $4.00 for a soup, tea and small slice of chocolate cake. Everything (carbonara, soup and cake) was just so-so. As for the tea, the staff did not even check with me if to serve with the meal or later. It came at the start and the tea was cold by the time I was ready to drink it

Had our dinner at this restaurant on May 11. We ordered Shrimp Aglio Olio ($10.90), Curry Chicken Bread ($5.90), Cheese Fries ($5.90), Fettuc/Carbonara ($8.90), Pork Chop with Aglio Olio ($10.90) + Ham&Cheese sandwich ($6.90). The food tasted just like the typical food court flavour, not great, just okay. I thought the Curry Chicken at Killiney @ Marina Sq definitely tasted much better. Order has to be placed at the cashier. Store does not accept credit card - only cash or NETS. Water is available via self-service and provided FOC

it's just like a normal restaurant serving western cuisine (fast food type) but taste good & service was great. Pricing was not so expensive (by Singapore standard). I had Pork Steak with mushroom sauce/rice-it's OK but I heard that the Pasta here is good as well. May be next time I will try. Anyway, if you do not expect any proper western restaurant with a napkins, knife/fork on the table and a great wine. This is the place

I visited this restaurant located at Suntec City Mall for dinner. This was one of the limited restaurants open due to renovation. Waiting time was reasonable, and food quality was okay. I ordered one of chef recommendations - 'Pan Fried Salmon'. Although fish was good (on its own), there was not much 'fusion' with the pasta. It could have been made better. We also ordered a Cheese Cake, but it didn't stand up to the price.They didn't serve water but could be picked up on our own (self service).No 'service charge' in the bill, which was a positive however; they didn't accept credit cards, which was a negative

I was looking for food place to eat at suntec city since the its under renovation. Till I got my foot to this place who's hiding all the way up 3rd floor. At first, I kinda like curious about the place, and what food they serve... I ordered a slice of their scrumptious apple crumble and it was utterly good. The front liner ( I think her name was jean..) is very accommodating. The place i think needs a bit of interior style but nonetheless, I will still give excellent rate for their good service. I will recommend this place for those in a budget who looks for good food and wants to be treated VIP... And I mean that.
