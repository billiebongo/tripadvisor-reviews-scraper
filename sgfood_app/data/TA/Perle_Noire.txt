Besides being the best stocked steakhouse in the east, Perle Noir chef/owner has come up with a new innovative lunch menu, which we enjoyed yesterday accompanied by a nice chilled bottle of wine.
Well done, great taste and a good selection of choices.

Forget about the poor location and design of the restaurant not mentioning the spoiled chairs.
Delicious oysters, salad and mushroom soup at very competitive price. Same for the wine.
Will definitely come back. A perle on the East.

This restaurant has change its name to Black Pearl Steakhouse. It is my favourite restaurant in east coast Singapore. The ambience is casual but the food has always been great to me. The price is reasonable compared to downtown restaurants. There is a good selection of steaks including wagyu and tomahawk for two/three to share. Of course in Singapore with staff resource constraint, you need to be patient with waiters/waitresses and the time for the chef. whats the hurry but to enjoy your food in fast paced Singapore. Go for the sari clams and oysters if you are into seafood. Otherwise go for the lovely seafood pasta

We were here with the extended family to celebrate the birthday of my brother-in-law.My son had the Tom Yang pasta, my wife had the Salmon and I had the Duck Confit.The Duck Confit was excellent and one of the best I have tasted in Singapore. The duck skin was very crispy and the meat tender. My son loved his Tom Yang pasta; and my wife liked the Salmon dish as well

It's no longer called Lao Bai Xing. It's now Black Pearl SteakHouse (Perle Noir). Along with the name change is a revamp of the menu which now offers Western cuisine. Great value set meals with options. Grilled prawns with Aglio olio spaghetti GOOD! Grilled fish GOOD! Cobb salad GOOD! Soup GOOD! Attentive service. Go before the crowd discovers this place. Limited free parking just outside

Change name and decor, but apparently food is still fusion. Its really so-so. Oysters were ok, Fish and chips were, alright, the fusion sauce was .. blehh! Ngoh-Hiang was... forgetful. And so were the rest of the food. Definitely not coming back and its not worth the price.And service was poor; a waitress spilled soup on my friend's pants, and even tho my friend said, its ok, they could have provided a wet clean cloth to damp away

Had a birthday dinner celebration for my godson. We have 6 pax and all of us ordered the set dinner which came with an appetiser of tiger prawn cocktail, choice of soup, main course and a drink. The lobster bisque soup is delicious and the beef ribeye steak was tasty and tender. Good value for money

The food is good. Had the prawn aglio olio for lunch today. It's part of their lunch deal for $12.90 and includes a drink. I also like their seafood pasta and pork chop. The menu has been evolving and their squid ink pasta, German style trotters and use of dukkah have gone but I have enjoyed their new additions. Think the chef is very talented. You must try their pork chop or the seafood pasta to see what I mean.

I visited Perle Noir this evening for a bite to eat, having been several times before for coffee and desert I was expecting it to be good. I requested chicken breast but asked to swap the potato for one of the salad options on the menu, I was told that would be ok. When it arrived it was a chicken breast with three pieces of rocket. I asked if that was the salad and they confined that it was and that was my only choice. I said that it seemed insignificant for a main and asked them to make it a bit more appetising but they refused so I sent the dish back. I didn't want a big salad but come on it's not hard to add a bit of salad to replace the existing side. The manager chose $0 instead of making a customer happy

If you are looking for affordable set lunch for Western food, this is a place for you. The service is still good. But If you are looking for a French Bistro, you might be disappointed. We were having dinner here and ordering from Ala Carte menu. I am hoping to taste French or European Food, not Asian cuisine. They tried to be creative or fusion with Asian flavor on their Western menu, but the cooking is more local experience than French or even European type of cuisine. E.g. The Duck Confit is paired with berry jam (very starchy), the mini cube potatoes are oily fried with Shiitake Mushroom, not potatoes gratin. We also ordered NZ Rack of Lamb, meat is good but no sauce, just served with some mash potatoes which is supposed to be with truffle, but tasted instant.I The breads which were baked to serve, is like sweet round milky bun. See photo. Maybe my expectation for French Bistro is too much for Singapore. So I asked what is their popular dishes being ordered, the staff recommended Prawns Aglio Olio Linguine or can try Beef Tom Yum Linguine. If you are looking for Pasta dish with Asian touch, I guess this is a place for you. Maybe I should give them a chance by ordering other dishes, but since it is not a cheap place, we ordered three items and all disappointed, I would prefer to go to a real French Bistro than to eat Western-Asian food here

Excellent restaurant with surprisingly good food, expert menu and great weekly specialities.
Fine dining at extremely reasonable prices and a warm and cosy atmosphere.
Repeat customer !!!!!!

Tried the Fish & Chips and Sirloin Steak set lunch, and half a dozen oysters. Food was average, service is good. Free parking.

Along Upper East Coast Road, Perle Noire is a cozy restaurant with good food and service that we would return to again. Most of the dishes that we tried (oysters, foie gras, pan-seared scallops, etc) were enjoyable. Great place for family and ladies gatherings.

i have been patronizing this restaurant since it first opened, back then it was located just a few doors away from siglap centre and now it has moved down the road to goodwill courti always felt that the chef/owner of this restaurant which to me is kind of a hidden gem is really underrated and not appreciated enough, he really has talent and belongs to the new breed of upcoming chefs in singaporei have not gone back for a few months but paid a visit today and was very pleasantly surprised to know that he has consistently maintained the standards of his foodone thing i like and appreciate about this restaurant is that they have good set lunches at affordable prices and he has always tried not to raise his prices too muchat present he has a $12.90 set menu for lunch and a 39.90 menu for dinner and its worth it , the set lunch has a main course selection plus coffee and teahe has a very worth it oyster day once a week, on mondays he has this offer of a second main at 50% off and sundays he has a really nice dory fish and chips for about $24 for 2 peoplehis service staff does change quite a bit but they have been uniformly very polite and helpful all these years, today they had an indian waiter and a very young looking chinese one, both were courteous, hardworking and the manageress a very attractive lady whom i believe to be the chef's wife has always provided great service and she really remembers her regular customersas for dessert, you can't leave without trying the chocolate molten lava cake, to me one of the best you can find herei very highly recommend this classy little gem of a place in upper east coast road, so what are you waiting for make your way there, quite a few buses stop just about 150 metres away! so hurry come support this excellent singaporean che

Tucked amongst hi-class bicycle shops, a spa and a dermatologist is Perle Noire at East Coast Road Singapore. When I first tried it, I was blown away by the exquisitely tender beef, the creamy fresh oysters and the incredibly lobstery lobster bisque. I have since gone back several times and I am impressed that the chef keeps upgrading the menu, trying out new recipes yet maintaining the good flavors in favorites. The squid ink pasta is another delicious dish along with the foie gras which chef gives a generous portion of despite it being a starter. Chef recently introduced a set menu at an incredibly reasonable $39.90 comparing the whole works. For dessert the creme brûlée is fantastic silky smooth and carmelized to perfection for that crunch. This restaurant looks simple and classy from the outside but serves classy food with classy prices.

The $39++ dinner set menu was quite good! Starter, soup, mains and hot beverage was all just nice!Chose the ribeye 180gm steak and it came exactly the way I ordered it, medium. In total, the 4 of us had 02 pasta ala carte selections, 02 dinner sets, 02 glasses of wine, 01 Caesar salad and 1/2 dozen oysters and our bill came to $229 all in Nice ambience and pleasant decor with chandeliers. Service staff was pleasant and attentive though at times the 3 of them seemed a little swamped especially when the restaurant reached full occupancy around 7.40pm.

decided to pop in for a quick lunch. went to the set menu.surpassed all expectations. had the:chunky mushroom veloute with a touch of truffle. french onion soup was sweet salty.nicely cooked cod medallion with good seared skin and the smoothest mash ever.crispy well seasoned sweet potato fries with the half spring bird that was both juicy inside and crunchy on the skin.i think the coffee was french pressed? good regardless
4
The China Chinese wait staff was very friendly, and even told us that warm water is good for us and should not take cold water, when we asked for warm water. Desserts here were quite nice. Can't say anything about the food as we didn't have lunch, but must say that the selection looked appertising
4
Good tapas menu. Clams were very fresh, escargots were tasty. The grilled scallops were tasty but a little over cooked.The best dishes were the squid ink pasta and the lamb rack. Cooked to perfection, and we would come back anytime for these 2 dishes alone.Service was friendly and helpful. Certainly worth a visit and we would rate it 4/5
4
We love the pork rack, squid ink pasta, seafood pasta and pork knuckle. Call me silly but I really like their cobb salad too. For a light appetiser, I like their scallop carpaccio or escargot. Grace and Apple are great hostesses. Always a warm welcome. Though the menu may not be extensive, don't forget to check with Apple for specials. I have tried their white truffle roulade which is yummy and can be specially ordered in advance and other desserts that are off the menu

My hubby and I were having a late lunch here. We ordered 3 course set lunch. We enjoyed it. Cauliflower soup, grill chicken, pan fried Snapper and Durian cream purée. We will come back for the Oyster.
5
Really enjoyed our meal there. The oysters were fabulous and my seafood main was excellent. The wine list was Good and about usual pricing. I will certainly go back again. Some of my friends have already returned for another excellent meal.

I have never been a big fan of french food but this is one place I keep going back. Tucked away in Siglap, Perle Noire serves up great modern french cuisine. Their beef steak and lamb racks are choice picks, as well as seafood pasta.Go on a Wednesday if you are an oyster lover. Its Oyster Night, $10 for half a dozen oysters.. top quality; fresh, sweet & salty (you get the drift)Best of all, its not crazy expensive.The pretty Lady boss is very friendly and will make the effort to know her guest

Although the restaurant doesn't have a huge selection of food, the food really taste great. On Wednesday is the Oyster night. Oyster are sold cheaper. I would really recommend the squid Ink pasta, the lamb rack and the pork rack as well as the pork knuckle. The chef really put in a lot of effort in his cusine as the ingredients are all fresh. The dessert is a must TRY!! recommendation are the Banana Rhubarb, The tiramisu totally rocks. I am very picky when it comes to tiramisu and perle noir really nailed it. The Yuzu Ice cream is awesome, it has this refreshing taste. The other dessert are also great. I can vouch for them as I have tried nearly all of them. Although its pricier than a typical restaurant like those in the shopping malls, The quality makes up for it. I would say this is fine dining rather than those restaurant where the cooks are employed foreign talents. The chef is a local chef. Its all about quality of the food I guess. You are paying for the quality. But if you are someone who is not picky about food quality and is fine with places like jack's place, then you might find it pricey

Noticed this restaurant when i went for Strictly Pancakes which was a few shops away. Finally got a chance to visit Perle Noire for my sister's birthday celebration. She was craving for oysters so when she called to make a reservation, she asked if oysters would be served daily or do we need to place an order in advance. The person who picked up her call assured her that oysters are available daily.2 days later we were there at the restaurant, only 1 table was taken then. Was browsing through the menu while waiting for others to arrive and just then, 1 lady came up and informed us that oysters are SOLD OUT.My sister was very disappointed upon hearing that. I explained to the lady that prior to this visit, we have indeed called to check on the availability of the oysters and yet this has to happen. She said that the delivery is on the way though. She went on to call the delivery man and confirmed that they will arrive 730pm-8pm.She apologized for the inconvenienced caused. Saying that it was Sunday, (not sure why, no delivery on Sunday or ?), there were a lot of take away on Saturday (not a reason also, i mean, you should manage your supplies), the season and so on. We just kept quiet and listen. It was finally 730pm and alas, oysters came ! The place was getting crowded as well and we placed on our orders. 1) Mussles in spicy wine (all of us find the soup very tasty and muscles were fresh. Bread to go along and we cleared them all, saw other tables ordering this as well)2) Oysters were fresh (according to those who had it, i did not try it personally. 1 and 1/2 dozens for 3 person)3) Garlic tiger prawns (not bad)4) Hokkaido scallops (not bad)5) King prawn aglio olio (it says king prawn here but i thought it was the same size as the garlic tiger prawns. personally i find that it will be nicer if it's more spicy. not enough garlic for me)6) Steak (Ribeye SOLD OUT AGAIN and we ordered tenderloin instead. According to those who tried, it was ok)7) Pork Rack (Nothing special on this one, a bit dry and not much of taste)Paid about $280 for the above plus a tea and sprite. Quite expensive given the location. But i think i will be back for their mussles. Please dont expect big portions here, i think it's more of a fine dining style. (4pcs of garlic prawns, 3 scallops)They are quite flexible with your requirement as well. I don't take dairy so for whatever i ordered, she have instructed the kitchen not to use any. She missed out 1 order though, strawberry salad but no big deal. Service wise, quite prompt in clearing our plates and etc. There were like 3 floor staffs.I would have given it 4* if not for the oysters incident

Visited on a Saturday night and the service was being managed by a total of three staff between 8-10 tables. Service was slow to start, the bread reached us 20 minutes after being there. Strong aroma of grilled meat in the main dining area. Appetizer portion sizes were really small, the scallops has only two pieces. Service remained slow throughout, had to continuously attract attention for napkins, cutlery, water etc. At SGD 75 per head in this part of town, without alcohol, we were expecting quite a bit better.The food itself was reasonable, so two stars for that, but better can be had within a stone's throw

It was my 3rd time in this restaurant this Saturday. The restaurant moved a bit further in Upper East Coast road. The place is modern, white color but also a bit cold, I personally prefer the previous one.Nevertheless, the food is still very nice and tasty. This time we tried the ratatouille with egg, the fish of the day (barramundi), steak with blue cheese and fries. All were good, well cooked with fresh ingredients. The only disappointment was the garlic bread, which was dry and oily.The staff is friendly but a bit clumsy. They need to improve, itâ€™s just a lack of experience and it has not spoiled our dinner.In a whole, good price for the quality. We ordered a bottle of wine which was not overpriced. The menu offer also nice seafood, especially oysters for those who like.All the best to the owner and staff ! Will return anytime

Ambience-new location, newly renovated, clean. When I reached it's around 7ish,when the crowd started to come, it became noisy. Prefer the old place.Food - garlic bread, kinda plain. Mushroom soup was OK, had ribeye wasn't fantastic perhaps I was expecting much better. There wasn't aroma of grilled meat and it wasn't juicy. Dessert - hot larva cake, it's the best of the night, Which I had 2 rounds. Maybe because it's small but no doubt is awesome. Apple crumble was good too, the based was baked just nice and nit too sweet.Overall- Will return only for desserts, and its overpriced for neighborhood restaurant, ribeye was $38/dessert $25

This is fresh news. Normally, i want to give good reviews but this is not one of them I was looking for a place to eat this evening and I have spotted this restaurant which is a little near my house. I was outside and wanting to stay at the table outdoor because of the ambiance but when I called the attention of the waiter, he stared at me, and ignored me without even taking a minute to check. Please note that I waved my hand. Of course my interest took its plummet. Too bad I could not rate for their food. With that, I am not inspired to go back. I hope this will not happen to others. To be fair though, the mood of the restaurant looks nice and Intimate, that's why I got lured to it in the first place.

The ambience is lovely, a dimly lit restaurant which is hard to come by in Singapore. The service is very good. Wine list good with a decent selection of Australian and French wines. Oysters large and fresh (from Canada), not fatty, very delicious. Hubby ordered pork knuckle which he loved. I ordered prosciutto wrapped sea bass, which was beautifully cooked. I found the sauce seasoning a bit strange, not typically french - should have been delicate with lots of french herbs, or creamy with wine - it was a bit stodgy I found. Otherwise a really good meal. Worth a second visit definitely
