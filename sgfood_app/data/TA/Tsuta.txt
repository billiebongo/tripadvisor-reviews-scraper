I've been to many places for ramen is this one is one of the best. Truly Japanese experience, quality products and finest noodles! Definitely worth going alone or with friends. Seating is quite uncomfortable though.

1 Michelin starred Ramen restaurant in Singapore.I've been to Tsuta like 2 or 3 times when I visited Singapore last year.Below is my honest thoughts from my experiences during my visit.1. Food QualityThey are not standard Ramen restaurant. which means the Noodle itself was very different from normal Japanese Ramen noodle that I have tried in Japan.Probably because the noodle was made from different ingredients or something.I would say it can be varies what types of noodles you prefer but personally it wasn't my taste.Other than the Noodle itself, The soup taste really good. I ordered Shoyu Soba and you can immediately taste strong flavor of Truffle and it was fantastic!I liked everything except for the noodle. Again this is my personal taste.<Table>There's no table for a party. It is more like a Sushi table where you can see the open kitchen right in front of you. I was there at lunch time with my friends(3 of them) and we couldn't sit all together due to high occupancy. I wish they had a table. <Order>You need to order and pay before you go in. Theres a big touch screen menu with all the photos at the entrance.<Conclusion>If you like "Soba" style noodle you will like it. If you prefer standard style noodle like me I don't recommend this place. There's bunch of great Japanese Ramen restaurants in Singapore

The first and (till date) only Michelin Star awarded to a Ramen Restaurant in Japan (and in the world), Tsuta ramen opened it's first Singapore branch some time back. It's specialty being the truffle infused broth along with the usual ramen ingredients.The place is almost a replica of the ramen shops in Japan - long lines, pre-pay at vending machines, sit along a long table of fellow ramen eaters, eat and leave.At the end of the day, I was not impressed with the final product. I found the broth salty (they have original/less salty and more salt versions, I had picked the less salty version), and found that the truffle absolutely destroyed the taste! I have come across many better tasting ramen bowls in Japan and SG than this (having tasted some of the Michelin Star restaurants, sometimes I feel they just award a star to these places for having used truffle in their menus). Of course, this is my personal preference, and others might like the truffle broth - it's definitely a novelty for the first timers and is the only outlet in SG that provides it. So, check it out once and make your own decision - unlike other Michelin stars, this one wont break your bank, you will come out at most $25 dollars poor. If you like the taste, good for you - add it to your list of ramen dens in SG

Tsuta has been around in singapore for 1yr+. They open another outlet @ 18 Tai SengNow that the queues are more Forgiving I have been to tsuta 6-7 times or more. Still love The shoyu truffle ramen. It has good umami taste which explains why I keep going back for more. Truly unique ramen which doesn’t make u “jelak”. I love ippudo too but the porky tonkotsu flavour makes me space out my visits. Would love it if ichiran ramen opens here and will go absolutely berserk if Osaka yashici ramen expands to singapore... yashici ramen is really another beautiful flavourful pork chicken ramen comb

i tried shoyu , shio and miso base soup for the ramen. if you like clear base soup shoyu and shio are choice. shoyu has more strong seafood taste and siyo slightly milder and much clearer soup than shoyu. i preffer miso base soup which more cloudy and has strong taste of miso. the ramen it self is ok, a bit chewy . the overal expirience was good, the queue was not that long. good place to eat on rainy days. the miso soup was good

Busy on a Saturday afternoon and waited 20 minutes. Worth it though.We both had the duck soba with egg. The egg itself was perfect with a rich, runny yolk. The broth was duck based but did not have the additional egg yolk mixed in so was not as thick as other versions I have tasted. The duck was tasty although with only two slices it felt a bit light. We had the pork cubes and duck wonton as sides. The soba itself was delicious, not too soft
3
The tokyo restaurant has a michelin star but not this one in singapore. The euphora has died and at 230 when we arrived, there's no queue. They have a japanese ordering machine system at the front but a staff is there to help. The broth is light and they're stingy with the char siu pork. Ippudo is bette

First visit to this michelin 1 star worth ramen store. Had tried the shoyu ramen. What is slightly special of Tsuta ramen to the usual kinds around is that it has a tinge of truffle flavour. The noodles does not make you feel sick of it.Char siew is soft yet not fat.Egg is done well. Wanton is made of duck (kamo) meat which is kind of unique.The overall dish taste light yet umami, however it lacks the 'ohmm' feel. It will be a perfect for those who prefers lighter flavour broth.The ingredients is little but you can add on of various ingredients at varying prices.
3
Been here twice and both times I had the Miso flavoured one which was rich, flavourful and addictive! I love the broth definitely. However both times my partner had the Shio soup base, the consistency and standard differed so much!! The first time we came it was alright, but the second time it was so thin and flavourless!! Even the pork charshiu pieces were smaller and thinner. Not sure if i would like to come back again... But I’d like to mention that I did enjoy the texture of the handmade noodles very much as well
4
Very good soup base. Although was very thirsty after eating. Price is pretty affordable.
Chef gave us free wanton soup as he mixed up our orders. Wanton was not very good.
Will go there again.
1
I came because of the Michelin star awarded. But really disappointed with the taste of soup and also texture of ramen. Not recommended to visit here and the price not worth the value as well.
4
The ramen is very unique from the rest as it includes duck meat instead of the normal pork meat. I do not quite like the egg as the yolk does not have the standard as the rest of the ramen. Soup contains truffle which makes the soup taste good
4
If you hate standing in long lines for decent food, now is a good time to go. After a year of popularity, the locals have gotten over the fad and lines are less and shorter unless a large tour group stops by!Plus the price has been reduced to normal levels.Michelin rated noodles for S$11
3
For a place that has a Michelin Star was so underwhelmed I can get better ramen back in Perth The broth was lack lustre, and the price tag was way over the top compared with what u got No fungi no seaweed Won’t be going here again And can’t see the hype
5
Came here by recommendations from my Singaporean gf . We have to que , there's chair for you to seat while queuing . We pay through the vending machine when ordering our food . I had the truffle pork ramen which was piping hot & delicious. Will definitely come back to dine here if I visit Singapore
4
Authentic Japanese Ramen bar, small simple menu but with big taste. Surprisingly easy on the pocked. Great for a quick lunch or dinner.If I did have a complain it would be lack of drink for non alcohol drinkers- wheat tea is an acquired taste but is all they ha

At last, I had a chance to taste Tsuta at Pacific Plaza.The experience was pleasant as there was no queue (outside). It was full house, but the wait was inside. Took around 10mins from entrance to get a seat at the bench. Advance payment was a breeze with a staff stationed to assist. Not a very wide menu, but sufficient. Food arrived very quickly in a nice big bowl. Quantity was just enough to fill, yet craving for more. Best part of it all was the onsen egg which was done to perfection. I would have given an award just for the perfect egg. Even though it rested in the soup until the last bite (I always keep the best for last), the yolk was still runny. The soup was just right. Not terribly salty, yet with a zing, a kick that hints of some citrus... or was that the yuzu gyoza? Anyway the experience was positive, although a repeat visit may not be so soon. So many ramen option in Singapore to choose from
3
So the same person who brought in Hong Kong's 1 star Michelin restaurants Kam's Roast and Tim Ho Wan has also decided to bring in Japan's 1 star ramen eatery....and house them all in the same building. The eatery only serves ramen in shoyu broth and you order and pay using a computer screen at the entrance. The noodles itself were nice- springy and with bounce. The additional onsen egg I ordered was also good, with an orange oozing yolk. The broth however was too plain and flat for me, saved only by the truffle oil. The pork was a little dry but I guess It's because there was very little fat on it. The additional yuzu wanton I ordered? So subtle, you can hardly taste the yuzu. And prices here are higher than what you find at other ramen eateries in town. Worth checking out just to see what the fuss is about but not worth the queue, if any
1
In Singapore people queue just because they see one...I have no idea how on earth this place got its 1 Michelin star. I had better ramen with funnier and warmer atmosphere not to mention less expensive, in some dark alley of Tokyo, than this ridiculous place. First you queue until you arrive the pre-entrance area where a mechanical rude girl hands you out a menu. After another wait you are invited inside and requested to choose for an electronic board you type of ramen, you drink, your extras. Then pay in advance. Then wait. Finally you enter a cold modern room with no ambience whatsoever, filed with the noise of people slurping on their noodles. You seat at a counter and watch the cooks prepare your ramen. All is perfectly calculated, mechanical. The exact amount of noodles, the broth, 1 egg, 1 bamboo shoot, 3 slices of pork, one spoon of olive puree, 1 spoon of truffle oil. The broth is salty, overwhelmed by the truffle oil. The pork is greasy. Cheap cut. Everything else is below average. As cold and tasteless as the huge electronic board at the entrance. Worst overpriced ramen ever. There are better funnier tastier and cheaper ramen in Singapore 
2
Either you like this ramen or you don't, there is no in between. I don't like it. Because i am used to an Ippudo broth, therefore, this ramen is a disappointment for me.
3
Now that the novelty effect has worn out, no more Q (or a short one at meal times). The shioyu broth is indeed distinctive, and the ramen is not bad, but once you load it up with all the extras, it’s SGD 30 per bowl - not worth it. When I first visited the place almost a year ago, it had at least staff members for the 18 seats in the restaurant; maybe that was for training purposes (as they opened a second branch), because now there are only 5 or 6 staff members, which is more reasonable
5
I went there during off peak; thus no queue...try their signature ramen but with no egg as wasn't feeling that well then. 4 pork slices....yummy yummy soup...tender meat...ramen really smooth and of right length and rexture. only con is price a bit higher than ramen sold in a cafe, but ok as it's really in a different class
3
Saw this "Michelin-starred ramen" restaurant and decided to give it a try. Simple counter only seats restaurant, with a self service ordering machine (there are staff there to assist). Ordered the Cha Siu Shoyu Soba (added the egg) and the Yuzu Wanton.The difference in this ramen from my point of view was the truffle pureed in truffle oil. Therefore the soup tasted pretty much of the truffle, but after a few mouthfuls, it kinda got too "greasy" or "sick of it feeling". So guess it is only for the truffle oil lovers. For me the char siu was a little too tough, really had to chew hard. Had before those char siu that were cooked nicely and melted in your mouth, this was not that kind. The egg was nicely done, inside still wet with yolk. The Yuzu Wanton had the yuzu taste, the clear soup tasted good. Overall, I think it is just average, not really worth the queue in my opinion (if you had to queue). Try to go during off peak hours otherwise the queue will be long
4
This review has a good rating.1pm on a Wednesday and no queue so we decided to eat there.Because all the seats are by the counter, I was extremely put off by the Chef and assistant gossiping about a colleague of theirs right in front of me. It certainly affected my mood.My bowl of Ajitama miso soba with 4 slices of pork costs $23.80. The egg was runny and flavourful. Love the semi fatty pork slices.
4
came here last week, try their signature michelin ramen, loaded with yuzu wanton and extra pork belly char siu.for basic price around $20, this one is quite above normal price range, but without extra wanton or char siu itself, the ramen and the broth was superb.will come back again.i come at 4 pm and no queue, i was ready for queue, but no one queue and i seat immediately
5
For those who likes thick and salty broth, this is not for you. They serve ramen with clear broth with the right taste and saltiness. You have options to order 1 or 4 slices. There are other ramen options as well. They also have rice bowls which is good for kids. It is just a small portion but it is very good as well. They only serve iced water, beer and hot tea for drinks. Expect long queue most of the time. I suggest for you to come during off peak for more chances of shorter queue. They have high chair for the toddlers and you need to order and pay first before your meal is served. There is a kiosk upon entry and just provide the receipt to the waitress. This ramen is great for us and we would come again soon
3
The self pay kiosk is the initial put off and although we didn't have to wait I still prefer to pay after having eaten my meal. The decor is somewhat stark and the tasks performed by the staff are all very mechanical with little or no dialogue with the diners.The soup was lightly salted as ordered but the generous four slices of pork were a little too thick and the meat much tougher than what I was expecting.All in all the meal which consisted of two bowls of noodles and included two beers came to S$65 which is expensive! I have had much better ramen in Singapore with less hype and at more affordable prices

It was such a hype. Read it everywhere, wow, Michelin star ramen in town. Went to try it today with my friend as we were both curious and love Japanese food. You come in, spanky new Japanese minimalistic style restaurant with only counter seats. Order at the machine, which was directed by a friendly staff and shown to your seats. Then the order ticket is given to the chef and your meal is cooked to order. My friend ordered the signature shoyu soy sauce soup base with egg & char siew and added extra 1 slice char siew, and 1 cold tea. Total price over $20. I ordered the new menu special miso soup base (which the waiter said would be abit spicy) with egg & charsiew, added 2 pc yuzu wanton to share. Total price $19.80, no drink (but they gave a cup of water)I noticed the machine stated "soba" not ramen. The waiter explained some soba buckwheat is added into the noodles but it's still ramen as it's not 100% soba. Hmm...We sat down, watched the chefs prepare our meal in this spanky dazzling open kitchen with nice clean lines and modern design crockery. Seems impressive? That's when everything started going south. The meal was served. Presentation was ok. They did take some effort and made a show of plating in front of guests. Naturally we first tasted the soup. Question: why was it Lukewarm? Not piping hot as ramen soup should be. Next, why does the "special miso" taste like melted cheese in soup?? (Really tasted like the cheese ramen I had from ma maison tonkatsu ramen at Capitol piazza) It was quite awful as it was like cheese but not cheese. Did their miso go bad? But shouldn't be as the waiter told us the miso was a new menu just launched on Monday! Couldn't have gone bad in 3 days... it really tasted odd. I ate it anyway because I thought it was " supposed to be like that". Supposed to be spicy but taste nothing. Supposed to have truffle taste also nothing. Only later on when they started cooking more bowls of ramen as more guests came in, then we had a whiff of truffle scent. I also tasted my friend's shoyu base. Frankly, it was diluted in taste without a rich soy sauce flavor. Kinda like hot water with some soy sauce added. I didn't like it. Other soy sauce ramen I've had were very fragrant and rich taste. The yuzu wonton taste was ok but the meat was so tough. The char siew was so thin and tough too. Really don't bother adding , not worth it. The soba ramen noodles were the thin type and cooked al dente. It was alright. I don't understand why there was raw red onion dice in the ramen. It just totally over powered other tastes and flavors with the raw sharp onion taste. The sweet corn was normal. Just corn lah! The only saving grace was the braised egg. It was done well. Firm outside, runny melty egg yolk and flavored well. The rest of the meal was just rubbish. My friend and I agreed this was one of the worse ramen places we tried. And we have been to quite a few in both sg and Japan. We left the place feeling unsatisfied. We even had to go get another meal! All the hype is just crap. No reason to Q here at all! Many other better and more reasonably priced ramen around. Even Ippudo which I do not like, is better! Will I be back? Definitely NO! Seriously, this, Michelin? They better check their food tasters' taste buds. This is the 2nd Michelin rated food in sg which is really bad, doesn't meet taste expectations at all. I've tried other Michelin recommended places abroad which were quite tasty but in sg... disappointing.

The outlet was the first overseas outlet by Tsuta 蔦 which originated from Tokyo, Japan, which was also known as the world’s first and only Michelin-starred ramen eatery. The outlet was quite small and could only sit 18 at the counter. Order was taken through the self service machine. There was no queue as we reached the place past 9pm. The place was just half filled. We were showed to the end of the counter with water served to us.Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($16.80)Char Sui (1 slice), flavoured egg, bamboo shoot, leek & truffle pureed in truffle oil Selected the original version.The soup base smelt quite nice of the truffle, with a hint of it in the taste. The soup was surprisingly light in taste and not salty, just nice. The noodles was cooked just nice. The char sui was tender and tear easily. The egg had the beautiful yolk flowing out easily, while not salty in taste.Ajitama Shio Soba ($16.80)Char Sui (1 slice), flavoured egg, bamboo shoot, leek & green olives pureed in truffle oil Selected the original version.The soup was made of a chicken-seafood blend, with additional of Okinawa sea salt and Mongolian rock salt. The soup base was lighter than the shoyu version, with a very distinct minty taste.Overall it was quite refreshing light and simple version of noodles soup without the fancy add on. There was none of the too salty soup base which I heard about
5
This is the best ramen on earth. 🌏
We each had the Truffle ramen and I had extra noodles in mine with traditional salt content.
The taste is amazing. So delicious 🤓
Eat here
3
I would first like to say the service here is top class. Food wise - maybe it is not too much to my taste so to me, it is just average. Though I love how simple the menu is too.
4
Tsuta claimed to be the 1st Michelin starred Ramen restaurant in the world. There is often a long cue for a seat during lunch time. My guest and I was walking by Pacific Plaza and was surprised to see there was no cue. We went in straight away.We ordered 2 ramen bowls and a pork dish. As practiced in Japan, the order must be done through a machine. A staff is present next to the machine to guide guests who are not familiar with this. The order was completed quickly. As we are on a low salt diet, we ordered the dishes with less salt. The ramen was good as well as the broth. Most of the time, I found ramen broth too salty. Ours came just the right taste for us. I am not a ramen fan but I may come back for more only if there is no cue. The pork is soft and tasted good. Perhaps a little bit of fat will make it more delicious.On the whole it was a typical "eat and go" type of restaurant as only counter seats are available. The place is spotlessly clean and the staff, courteous and friendly
3
Had a nice family lunch at the one Michelin star Tsuta. The ambience was appropriate - I felt transported to Tokyo. The side dish of rice with char siew was brilliant - our son wanted more. This was great value for money/ However the menu could do with more options for noodles. Nonetheless, they were of sizeable portions. Its a good place for a visit, and then to re-visit after a long while
3
My family loves ramen, and try it everywhere, even outside Japan. We tried the two branches of Tsuta (along Scotts Road and at 18 Tai Seng). The queues piqued our interest.For us, this Michelin-starred brand has hits (such as the Char Siu Shoyu Soba) and misses (such as the Ajitama MIso Soba). Orders are cheaper than at Ippudo, about parity with Santouka. Not sure if we will return
2
Wait time to enter restaurant : 20 mins - finally decided to eat it when we see its empty we were escorted to the self pay kiosk, basically you manage your own order and payment after payment - continue to wait for another 10 mins. kitchen is open concept, basically present the order chit for the chef to cook for your order. sounds cool. there was 4 -5 chefs in front of us, the chef signaled to wait staff to confirmed the order who is having what, such contradiction, when you have a open concept you encourage the chef to interact. kind of awkward the moment the chef took a glance at the wait staff behind of us. we quickly finished the food in 15 mins and left as there was q starting to q behind us, seating is very small and not much seats available in the restaurant. the Japanese family of 4 in front of us have to dine 2 by 2. in my opinion people with kids to come at less peak hours so you don't have to wait too long if you can't or your children might get cranky, nor occupied the seats for too long. Food - was so so, overated from the q we always see (but now we know its the slowness that accumulated the q) ... chef start to cook your food only when you sit down with the chit presented which means very fresh but another waiting time. funny to see 5 ppl watching 2 bowl of noodle. will not patronage again
2
visited the 18 tai seng branch. for a 1-Michelin star restaurant, it tasted really below par. ordered the truffle shoyu ramen with an extra slice of cha siew. smell of truffle was good, noodle was cooked to my liking in between hard and slow - just to be clear, it's not really chewy or Q like HK or taiwanese noodles. soup was very clear and could only taste the saltiness. quite disappointing yeah. FYI only bar sitting, which i was ok with, fast service which is good if you're starving :) we arrived about 1.15pm during a weekday, i guess the usual lunch crowd had left so we didn't have to queue
4
Thanks to previous reviewers, we asked for less salt which turned out to be a wise choice. We tried the ajitama shio ramen and the ajitama shoyu ramen. Both with additional slice of pork. As the weather is really humid, we had the cold wheat tea which is really good and not diluted, the tea is refillable. We loved the soup and finished almost all of it. It is light but very flavourful (could be partly due to the truffle oil). The shio version has a slightly strong minty taste and loads of chopped fine onion bits, so if you don't like mint or onion don't order shio. I love the shio soup. The shoyu is their signature and it is also very fragrant with a unique taste which we have not tried before. The soba noodles are average. The meat slices were cooked and marinated perfectly, we loved that it has a bit of a tough texture to it instead of the melt in the mouth type. The flavoured egg was also delicious. The queue was not long, we waited for about 15 minutes for our seats. All are counter seats by the way. We did not feel rushed at all. It was a very good dining experience end to end. We will definitely return again.

I ate at the outlet at 18 Tai Seng. Went there for dinner on a Saturday night. No queue which was good. When it first opened a couple of months ago, there was always a long queue, especially during lunch time. Always wanted to try and understand the hype. The ramen is pretty good I have to say. Love the texture. However, the soup / base was pretty blend. I prefer something stronger or more flavourful. My ramen with 4 slices of pork cost me around SGD 23 which is slightly on the high side. Service was good – the team was attentive. You order and pay for your food when you first enter the outlet. Do note that there is no proper dining tables as it’s all on the bar seats which is ok but may not be suitable for older folks. Overall, would I go there again? Maybe not as there are other ramen places that suits my taste buds Location: 18 Tai Seng is located just opposite Tai Seng MRT. Cross over to Breadtalk HQ and it is just 2-3 buildings next to it

@TheKuoKnowsCuriosity got the better of me. I had to give Tsuta a try, simply because of its Michelin-star rating. How good can a bowl of noodles really be?The simple answer is that it's not too bad at all. Tsuta has got the ordering system down to a T, thanks to a smart electronic point-of-sales terminal.Whether an EPOS is really necessary is arguable - the menu is quite limited, with only two soup bases to choose from.The soy sauce base is tasty, though it was tepid rather than boiling. I suspect it is quicker to drink warm soup.The ramen is pefectly cooked and the presentation is precise. There was more than enough garnishing with the basic option, which at $15 a bowl is quite pricey.Don't expect to lounge around after you have finished your noodles, though. It took me 15 minutes from start to being ushered out. That's a dollar a minute.
3
Michelin stars do not guarantee a delicious or outstanding meal, and my lunch was nothing special. I found the taste if the broth bland, and the noodles nothing extraordinary- not sure how if for what they got their star
1
Not sure why it was given a 1 Michelin star but obviously the person gave the star does not know how to differentiate between a good ramen and a bad ramen. Tsuta falls into the bad ramen category
5
It was amazing to come here and watch how the chefs here create the ravens with such meticulous precision!!
The food was excellent - the price was fair and the service was great!
2
No flavor other than salty. Charsiu is dry. Portion is small but I don't even want to finish. Worst Ramen ever had.
My kid refused to eat after one taste.
Good side is service.
3
Ramen is all the rage at the moment, and it’s easy to see why: there’s nothing finer for a light dinner than a bowl of noodles and delicious homemade broth.The “world’s first and only Michelin-starred ramen joint” doesn’t sell ramen. It sells only soba…made primarily (but not exclusively) of buckwheat (soba), which gives it a different, stronger flavor.A queue of ramen-lovers is normally snaking down the street waiting patiently for their noodle fix. The setting of Tsuta is low key. Ordering and payment is made at a touch-screen machine. The broth is enhanced by the richness of an infusion of truffle oil. The slice of roasted pork char sui on the surface is, although tender, not deeply tender enough. The noodles are firm and slurpable.Time is precious. I’m getting old. I might be dead soon. The food is good but is not worth the wait. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
1
Totally and utterly disappointing. As someone who really loves food and have traveled all over the world to try Michelin food, I am amazed that this ramen is even a Michelin Star restaurant. Possibility one: Singaporeans have ruined the food as we could not replicate the standard in Japan. Possibility two: this ramen is really overrated as any over the vending machine ramen shop in Shibuya can win it hands down. The ramen is too tough. The char siew tastes like cupboard: flat, dry and insipid. The truffle portion is so miserable that I need a microscopic lens to search for it. The soup has no truffle taste whatsoever. I have written about many Michelin Star restaurant and this is the first time I truly feel that a restaurant is not deserving of it. I'm a very easy going person with food as my friends have come to know me but I just can't help to profess my disappointment.
3
I went with a friend and I ordered the shoyu based soup, miso based for him.Can't say we were impressed with the flavour of the soup. The truffle was generous enough, you could definitely taste and smell it. However, it made me wonder what it'll taste like without the truffle. Overall the shoyu soup was tasty, not over-powering, but not impressive either. The miso based soup taste slightly stronger, at least once could taste both the miso and the truffle.The flavoured eggs were rather bland; one of the worst I've had considering I've had flavoured eggs with stronger tasting soups.The noodles however were good, al-dente.I also did like the bamboo shoots, they tasted fresh and were crunchy but not hard.I personally would not queue for this, nor would I make an effort to travel there to eat this ramen again. Not unless we were in the vicinity and there isn't a queue
3
Tried 3 Michelin rated eateries so far, two in their countries of origin and only one has been impressive so putting aside the rating and the discussion of its reliability, let's focus on the food and service in this place.There was a short but fast moving queue during Friday lunch hour. A staff would guide you to place order and payment via their online system and get you seated quickly. Food was served fast enough.We ordered both the Shoyu and Shio, which the only difference was the soup. Shio tasted better although both tasted quite salty even when we selected for "less salt". The egg was of normal standard, ramen texture was alright but the char siu was a disappointment unless you prefer yours to be harder. Portion was small so you may wish to go for the sides or have some good desserts in other parts of Orchard Road. It tasted like ramen with truffle oil, nothing to rave or complain
3
I've heard much about this place and have been tempted to give it a try for a while now. Of course I never had the patience to wait in a queue and therefore visiting for lunch on a Monday was a good solution. No queue today and went straight in. Very good presentation and preparation but the ramen wasn't exceptional. Unless you pay extra for top ups the servings are fairly small. Seems a bit overhyped to me
3
No more queue. It's a simple walk in, order and pay outside, then you get seated. Service is ok. What's good are the egg, hot tea, charsiew. Noodles and soup I didn't think it's anything to wow about. But it's a good bowl of ramen, just probably not the one to travel all the way here for.
2
Amongst the few Ramen shops, I've visited this without exaggeration this is at the bottom. With truffles being the selling point here but too bad the broth is overly strong on truffle oil and weak on everything else. Disappointed !
4
the food is very good, the staff very friendly and smooth run. Unfortunately not easy to go in a group of 4, because places are not always by 4 available. Anyway, it was a very positif experience.
2
It is a small 18 counter-seat noodle bar, when it open Nov last year, there were long queue for the novelty factor. After merely a few months, the jury is out and people stop coming. We come to this building every week, finally we decided to give this 'World's first and only Michelin star Ramen a try. We have the Char Su Ajitama Shio soba (less salt with olive pureed) and the Shoyu soba (original with truffle pureed) which is $27 each after ++. Yes, they call their ramen, soba. The were two ladies taking order on behalf of the ATM type of ordering machine, not a productive impression. The truffle oil don't go well with olives pureed, and the olive pureed made the broth sour and weird, it tasted awful actually. The shoyu version was slightly more palatable, pork slices was all right, not special, bamboo shoot and leek add good touch, the onsen egg was excellent and cold, so was the broth, not piping hot, just slightly warm. I would rated this the worst 'branded' ramen we have ever eaten. Not worth the effort to queue and try
4
I think eberyone should try this at least once. The queue will continue inside for another 15mins after you queue outside for 15mins. Once inside, you can start ordering on their automated touch screen with the help of staff so the queue time inside was more bearable. The layout of restaurant is pretty smart..u can only sit around bar and watch the chef prepare your meal and once u finished n u know everyone is still queuing, u kinda feel forced to leave once u finished. So we left after 15mins.. shorter time than 30mins queuing! Everyone says the ramen is special just because they put truffle.. no big deal.. I think the ramen is good and the broth light n favorful but i will only come back if there is no queue. Wr also ordered the cha siew rice which was good too. Average price $26 with drinks per pax.

The ramen served here is of good quality and you can, from watching the chefs work, that a fair amount of care is given to the preparation of each bowl. The flavour of the broth though is nowhere close in flavour to some of the better ones we've had in Japan. The food isn't cheap (this is Singapore) and I'm not sure if the food is worth queuing an hour or two for (as reported when this place first opened). If you are in the mood for a decent ramen meal, it's probably worth checking out. Just don't expect to be wowed

Went to the one at Tai Seng. Reached 1pm+, waited for around 30 minutes to be seated. There is only counter seats here, so best to go alone or just with another partner for prompt seating. Had the Ajiama Shoyu Soba (with 1 slice of char siu and 1 flavored egg). Once the ramen was served, the aroma from the truffle pureed was nice. I liked the clear soup, the rest were average

With all the hype of the first ever receiver of Ramen shop by Michelin Star, I decided to give this place a try. When we got there is approx noon time. We have to wait for approx 10 people ahead of us. The Shoyu Soba is just amazing. My favorite is the juicy chasiu accompanying the soba. Overall the food is really deserve one star Michelin award. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with the service. When we finished our noodles, barely 5 min., one of the waitress politely ask us to leave already. Her reason is because still many ppl waiting ahead of us. Honestly??? Not even 5 min? If let's say we sit more than 20-30 min after we finished the meal and you kick us out, I still can understand. Less than 5 min and you kick us out already? This is from the establishment that sell a bowl of Soba that cost more than 22sgd? It doesn't make sense at all!!

As a michelin starred ramen i guess this restaurant is far from my expectations. In my honest opinion, this ramen restaurant managed to get a michelin star because the ramen contains a very french ingredient that is truffle. The critically acclaimed shoyu ramen is average at best and the shio ramen is so minty that it tastes like savory marlboro menthol. This ramen is not my cup of tea at all and its only worth one visit in a lifetime. Cmon Michelin you can do a better choice in next year's michelin guide

Finished work late and walked by the usually packed Tsuta and surprise surprise no looong queue. Went right in a and ordered the Char Siu Ajitama Shoyu soba. The soup was just right n even I finished the whole bowl it didn't make me feel thirsty at all. The char siu was tender n the noodle cooked to perfection. It's a 18 seater so best to be in small group. It's def worth queuing for the Michelin star establishment

Visited the Taiseng outlet... It was surprisingly small, could accommodate about 20 people. The seating arrangement (by the bar style, facing the chefs) wasn't conducive for conversations. The staff member who served us wasn't very helpful. When asked to recommend a ramen dish, she merely pointed to the menu. Having said that, our ramen was cooked right before us and came very quickly.Please note you're paying $16.80 for only ONE piece of chashu and an egg (and memma or bamboo shoot which tasted quite... funky) if you order the Shoyu Soba. It wasn't very memorable but I appreciated that I could slurp it up without burning my tongue. I added a small rice bowl, the Niku Meshi with pork shoulder cubes, $6.80, which was alot more delicious than the ramen. Yum yum. And an additional $1.80 for a small cup of roasted tea. Two of my friends had the Ajitama miso ramen which was more vivid in taste, and they did like it.Would I return? Highly unlikely... I'd go back to Ippudo any day. I'd give this ramen joint a 3.5 stars though

Tsuta was founded in Tokyo in 2012 and promptly won a Michelin star. The first ramen bar ever to be so rewarded. Immediately afterwards people from all over the world begged Master Chef Onishi Yuki to partner with them. The only ones he trusted were a couple of restaurateurs from Singapore who had actually taken they trouble to queue up and try his food. The result is Tutsa Singapore which opened in November 2016. The concept is as close to the original as possible. The same simple menu, the same superb ingredients, the same chefs. Noodles flown fresh from Japan. This is as good as ramen gets. Ultimate umami and yet unbelievably cheap
3
Very nice soba texture, and a decent soup base, though it was the lighter shoyu version. I much prefer the richer tonkatsu style from chains like Ippudo. Price was reasonable, but an hour wait on a weekend dinner is probably the reason why I would not come back again
4
had to queue for 30 minutes to have this. not something that i expected. overrated, but that's my opinion/taste. i won't be back for 2nd round, not my kind of soba for a queue of 30 mins or more.some love it. could be the truffle that makes it unique. other than that, don't find it interesting .i still prefer the original clear non greasy soba
2
It was approximately half an hour wait outside and the process of getting in and ordering is very prescribed. It was interesting to sit at the bar and watch the chefs work in such a sterile environment - usually there seems to be much more soul at ramen bars. The food that is served is disappointing. My partner and I got each of the different flavours and the broth was disappointingly bland in both ramen bowls. For the price they were being sold for and the hype, it wasn't satisfying in the least
4
Very well managed kitchen counter. Good showmanship from the chef. Impressive presentation of soba noodle.Had less salt version and found the taste was excellent. Pork char siew was extremely well prepared with good pork fragance and chewing texture. To be honest, soba doesn't equal ramen.The price was a bit high personally as I still prefer my true ramen from Baikkohan

Another Insult to Michelin Star Franchise. This, kam roast and the famous chicken rice just goes to show the Michelin stars awarded are a scam!The worst ramen I have had. Even aijisen ramen tastes better than this.Definitely not worth queuing for or even trying.. I should have just gone to Macdonalds! The only saving grace was the onset egg. The meat had a smell. You couldn't customize the noodles and the soup with the truffle oil just killed whatever Japanese Shoyu they probably imported that would give it a 3 star rating I would give.. Beware of overrated ramen.. I'd eat it again if I had no other choice.Strong review: as I have a strong love for good ramen. So apologies for those who find this too strong a comment

Rather expensive and marginal value for money..1. Onsen egg was perfectly done with a sweet taste of mirin surrounding the exterior of the egg white and the golden yolk was soft and creamy - best item in the dish2. The truffle oil added taste to the soup3. Char Siu was tender but had some porky smell4. Bamboo shoot - 1 strand and nothing to scream about5. $22.80 for a bowl of Soba with extra Char Siu - not cheap !Be prepared to wait in queue if you arrive during the peak period. I visited at 11.30am on a week day and had to wait 20 mins.

The Chef won Michelin starred in Japan (I believe the only Ramen restaurant in the world who got Michelin star) and not for nothing. And he bring it to Singapore.Very simple food at the best. Admittedly the filling was average, however, the broth was incredible. So deep with so many layer on the taste. Try to visit out of meal period time or otherwise, get ready to queue
1
Not too much for the quality but compare to expectation with a Michelin star! That should be a joke! Being french a Michelin Star is earned not bought.Ramen with mint and shallots... where in Japan? Truffle why not ! Ok! It is very limited seats, low service and low choice! Go Keisuke much better, even ipudo.

After a 40 mins' wait, I managed to savor the supposedly best ramen in town. 1 Michelin starred, no less!The clear broth was full bodied without being oily - so I just want to slurp it all up! There was truffle oil and sweet basil leaf in the broth - which makes it interesting with the different flavors. Didn't feel thirsty afterwards, so I assume all natural stuff in there.The ramen was cooked with precision, so they were just right for me without being soggy or too hard.Overall smallish portions, so suitable for a full snack or light meal - if you are really hungry, get extra noodles I would suggest. I would eat this again, but don't like the wait
5
I love the service, its a small place but very confortable if you are eating alone.
It was my first time eating shoyu soba and now is one of my favorite food
My recomendation is to taste original recipe or light!

Noodle is not 100% cooked, bamboo shoot tasted ok but the texture kind soft, the egg was heavenly, cha shu a but hard. overwhelmed with the truffle smell and cover everything else. Definitely there are better ramen in Singapore.
4
Perhaps the expectations have been raised sky high and hence was always going to run the risk of a letdown with this Tokyo ramen restaurant on the basis of their 1-michelin star reputation. After a queue of about 30 minutes, was finally ushered in (although the 4 of us needed to be split up in order to get our seats faster). Ramen was tasty and was slurppingly good but having enjoyed Ichiran in Japan, can't say that Tsuta is better tasting than Ichiran's which in my mind is better. In fact, truth be told, I wouldn't say the some in the Keisuke Ramen chain is necessary poorer than Tsuta's offering. Would I come back to queue for this.... nah
3
After all the hype and the queues, not to mention the Michelin star, I was slightly disappointed with an ordinary tasting dish that tasted like soya sauce water. However the texture of the noodles was perfect and the sliced pork very decent. Won't go back though. $30 for the works. Not worth it.

Tsuta is really distinctive. It focuses excludively on ramen - only one ancillary dish (roast pork rice), no gyoza, cucumber, corn on the cob, pork bun, sushi rolls, etc like at some other shops. The broth is clear and light, fragrant with the addition of truffle oil; I would have preferred it to be served piping hot, but was explained that this is done on purpose to better bring out the flavours. The noodles are nice. I recommend ordering an extra bowl of rice with bonito flakes and seaweed, and pour your remaining soup over - it's quite comforting! This shop is quite Japanese in character, heavy on 'quality control' - modern but sober dÃ©cor; well-organised: 10 visible staff members for 18 seats, including one Japanese overall manager, one queue manager (there's always one), one person handling the order-taking touch-screen machine, one person just roasting the pork, etc). Don't know if it's worth the wait when the Q is long, but one can have it more often than the heavy broth type of ramen
3
This is the Singapore branch of the one star Tokyo ramen place. I try to focus on the broth and noodles before the add OB's. I found the broth to not be to the standard of the Tokyo location thus the experience was not up to the Tokyo experience. Service was good, the surroundings pleasant, but it just wasn't ther
4
Only Michelin star Ramen comes to Singapore & large crowds queuing since opening. After giving up queueing the 1st time, went back another time at mid-day around 3.30 p.m to avoid a long wait. Shoyu ramen flavoured by truffle oil & truffle paste differentiate Tsuta from others. Service was friendly & efficient fast food style
3
Not really a big fan of shoyu ramen. My first shoyu ramen was at a popular & simple shop near Tsukiji where queues get very Long but the Chef dishes out the bowls of ramen quickly. At tsuta we had the shio & shoyu ramen. Preferred the shoyu compared to the shio version. The chasu was tasty and tender and the broth was not really that salty. Just drink some water you will be fine.i do love the hit of truffle aroma in the broth though.Will I go again? Depends on the waiting time. I waited for 1hr and is not worth that Long a wait...probably about 30 mins still ok.. and just beside tsuta is tim Ho Wan take out counter ... smart!

Checked it out by myself after family had gone home in a different flight, perfect for an solo event ( couple is fine I guess but not for group or family). Waiting line always looks very long, but I have discovered that in Singapore people estimate time in a more responsible way, so it is not as long as they say it will be.You buy your food at the vendor machine as in many Japanese ramen shop. The menu is pretty simple, they do it have tonkotsu ( pork bone soup based ramen) as far as I could tell; they have salt and shoyu based ramen and some a la carte.I had salt based ramen.It tasted like truffle. The soup is super clear and fine. Perfect oil drops floating on top. I think the ramen soup is most clear among all ramen I ever had. The pork meat is tender than usual ramen. That again made it feel like soup than ramen. Only white part of the onion was served in my ramen. I am not so sure if I like the idea of truffle with ramen, hence 4 star instead of 5. FYI, I am a truffle lover.

I lined up in Hong Kong for 45 minutes but did not order as I preferred vegetarian soup. I had always wanted to try the ramen.So 3 years later I did not want to miss this opportunity in Singapore. It was around 2 pm so the line up was only 15 minutes,The server was very friendly me and helpful substituting an egg for the piece of pork.The soup was as another reviewer stated very salty and the ramen portion was very small.Not worth $15? However, to put this in context I had a Starbucks cappuccino which cost $7.Worth a visit if you curious about the hype like I was
4
Joined the queue at 8pm and was ushered to a seat 25mins later. My appetite grew just watching the chefs carefully prepare the dishes. Soon enough the bowl of Shoyu Ramen arrived. The noodles and egg were cooked to perfection. The broth was flavored with truffle and light on the taste palette. The chasu was above average, wished the meat had more flavor. Would I do it all over again? Yes. Saw that they had salted ramen on their menu. Will try that during the next visit.
3
We wanted to try out Tsuta given the publicity they received since they opened in October 2016. We queued for about an hour. They should have installed fans in the waiting area in the corridor. Though it was a rainy day it was quite humid. The noodles were ordinary. The stock were interesting and a bit unique. But I have tasted very good ramen in Singapore at other restaurants that do not come with the accolades. Is it worth the visit? Yes, if you have not tried it. Would I go again? No, once is enough. Nothing special to keep me going back.
4
Must try if you are Ramen Lovers. The seats are limited and would suggest pay a visit during off peak hours. Else, longer waiting times would expect ahead.May find the passion of the Chef while making a Ramen in front of you. Definitely can make a video if you keen. Price are average n they also have automated order n pay machine like .

We saw the sign "First Michellin Star Ramen", wow, we have to try this. But there was a long queue. So we decided to go back in between mealtimes hoping for a shorter line, so it was. I was a bit surprised when we had to use a machine to order. But of course it is the ramen that is more important.Watching the chefs prepare our ramen was fascinating. It sort of prepares your palet for something special is coming. The broth was nice and definitely different from the other ramen I have tried (although note that I am not a ramen guru). The noodle was good and the meat was quite ordinary for me. I ordered the Shoyu. But the egg was for me seasoned and cooked appropriately (between soupy soft and semi-hard boiled

Reached the restaurant about 5pm and queued for about 45mins. When it's your turn, you order and pay through a self-service kiosk which accepts both card and cash. Personally think it speeds up the service as it prevents people from taking a very long time deciding what they want to order. There isn't much to choose from anyway. 2 different soup bases, with different amount of ingredients. After ordering, you're seated at a bar (think if it as teppanyaki style) and wait to be served from the chefs.Found the whole dining experience very efficient, bordering on clinical.While the food is delicious, some might not enjoy the lack of intimacy when dining with friends or partners.

We joined the queue at 9.10 p.m, waited about 30 minutes for our turn. We deemed it acceptable as a first visit to a 'Michelin' star ramen bar.The chinese mature female service staff leading customers into the restaurant offers no basic greeting. She merely gesticulates to signal customers to come forward into the holding area and spends the rest of her time with her back facing the queue, looking at her handphone. At 10 p.m. closing, when there were still 6 customers in the restaurant, she stood at the kitchen entrance, in full view of the customers, audibly asking her young colleague from across the room if she would want a bowl of ramen for supper and why not (when her colleague declined).In contrast, a young female service staff (appears to be a student on a part time job) who assisted us with our orders was pleasant, polite and smiley, sending the right vibes. When seated, a young male service staff had to be reminded to serve water although the ratio of service staff to customers was a good 1 to 6. It was 20 minutes to closing but he was into a selective service mode. Care and attention was seen in the preparation of our shoyu ramen. Food was served piping hot. Ramen had a smooth and soft texture although I preferred mine more al dente. It paired well with the truffle oil infused shoyu dashi broth, albeit basic. The chinese customers beside me found the broth too salty and asked for water. The chef simply gave a 'no' hand signal whilst the service staff had no initiative to offer drinking water. The roasted pork had a chewy texture while the flavoured egg (correct doneness) tasted a little bland.Overall ratingsFood 2.75/5Aircon, lighting & dining area space 3.5/5Service 1/

Okay, so when it first opened, Michelin star or not, the long queue was daunting enough to stop me from checking it out.(I don't do queues, lucky enough that I scored a table at Kam's Roast (another Michelin star resto in the same building) before their opening day without queuing - the advantage of able to converse in Cantonese!)But traipsing daily to my yoga, the aromatic truffled soba just invaded my olfactory every day So, we waited until the major hoolaballoo has settled, before joining a much shorter queue. And if you go in smaller numbers i.e 2 person, its easier to bypass larger groups but you may end up being seated separately. But hey, this being a typical Japanese resto, you eat then go, and not stay for hours, so it didn't really bother me that my friend and I were seated apart.We love the ambience - simple, chic and zen. The staff are super friendly and you sit in an open counter with view of the preparation of your delicious bowls of ramen. Orders are taken once we stepped in, and payment (cash, credit cards or NETS) through a stand-alone ATM-looking machine. The menu is very straight forward - Ajitama Shoyu Soba or Ajitama Shio Soba. We opted for their more popular Ajitama Shoyu Soba. You can add on more eggs, bamboo shoots, or pork slices. As mentioned the soba is infused with truffle, which delights my senses no end. It is only springy and thin (I'm not a fan of thivk noodles).The broth, made with chicken, clams and fish stock is deliciously light, flavourful and brings out the truffle of the soba really really nicely. I only wished that the tamago egg is served sliced in half, and not whole as it's easier to bite into. But boy, it was really yummy and nicely done. The pork is lean and yet tender and doesn't over-powered the soup base. For beverage, its only wheat tea - cold or hot, but quite lovely too.Overall, this is a refined ramen, where each ingredient complements one another

My husband and I decided to try Tsuta one evening when we ran out of ideas on where to go. There was a queue but it was not as long as the usual queues. Finally, we reached the front of the queue after half an hour. You would need to order and pay from the machine. We tried both the types of ramen along with the rice and 2 cups of tea. My husband and I were actually surprised at how bland and unexciting the broth was. We were expecting Michelin-quality but what we had made us went huh??!! We have tried many ramen joints in Japan and in Singapore and found Tsuta's broth very disappointing. Service was basic and overall, the experience left us feeling that we had wasted our half hour queuing.Perhaps there needs to be quality control done by the Tsuta team from Japan. If not, the one in Singapore may just be a flash in the pan
3
Tried out Tsuta with a friend during one Sunday peak lunch hour around 1 pm. The queue all in all took 50 mins before we were seated at the table. The waiting time was tolerable with a companion around. The noodles were cooked to a right consistency and the broth cooked using clams had a refreshing taste. Worth having again probably the next time when the queue is shorter
4
Food ordering service is self service type. There's a machine at the entrance for customer to enter their own order. I've ordered the truffle oil blended Shoyu Soba which is their signature. Indeed its' ramen is cooked al dente but the char siu is just ordinary. The soup does have clear clean taste and fragrant with truffle oil. Restaurant layout is just like a typical counter sittings. Hence, not much a place for chatting; everyone sit facing the "kitchen" area. Overall the ramen is good and the restaurant gives you an impression of efficient service
