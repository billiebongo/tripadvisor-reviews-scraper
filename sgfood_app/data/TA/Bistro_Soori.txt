Style over substance. Food is average at best. Restaurant is well designed but abit cold. They went through many chef changes and so a little confused in their identity.

Divine little French excursion in the middle of Chinatown with a great atmophere and brilliant wines that you may have never had an opportunity to try by the glass. Excellent little eats if you are peckish and friendly staff.

Nice restaurant to take visitors and newbies - one of Singapore's modern fine dining places near bars in Keong Saik area. Would definitely go back.

I stumbled across this gem of a place the weekend before wandering around Keong Saik Rd and stopped to enjoy a charcuterie and cheese platter and a few glasses of white wine. The food and experience was so good that it warranted a second visit for dinner. The ambience is a quiet, sophisticated cool with walls lined with a nice selection of wine and various products available for sale. I ordered the hanger steak, 1 glass of of Pomerol red, chocolate cheesecake for dessert which totaled $73.70 (incl. GST). C'est si bon. Oui. I'll be back

Located at Teck Lim Road, Bistro Soori serves an affordable 3-Course Set Brunch at $39 ($79 for free flow of Prosecco / House Red / House White). The menu kicks off with a Confit of Portobello Mushroom, Spinach, Semi-Dried Tomato Mozzarella (ala carte $14) – a delicate and refined update from Caprese. Drizzled with balsamic vinegar, I taste the richness of the mushrooms as well as each of the subtly complementing elements.A Brunch essential is this beautiful plate of poached egg atop of jumbo lump crab, english muffin, tomato, mesclun salad and doused with hollandaise sauce (ala carte $24 for 2). The blandness of the jumbo lump crab is relieved with the creamy hollandaise sauce.I preferred the Pulled Pork Sandwich, Multigrain Toast, Arugula, Fries ($24) which served an umami-rich pork that enhances the flavour of this brunch dish.READ MORE: http://www.misstamchiak.com/sunday-brunch-at-bistro-soori

We stopped in recently for the set lunch at Bistro Soori with a few other Survival Chic members. As regulars, what keeps us coming back are the frequent (and delicious) new additions to the menu - this visit didn’t disappoint! The food at Bistro Soori is complex and intriguing, without being pretentious - not easy to pull off! We started off with cold melon canapés before moving onto seared tuna tataki, served with tobiko (fish roe) and cucumber jelly. Delicious! Next up was the foie gras - having lived in France, it’s something we’re quite picky about, but Soori's pan-seared version was fantastic. All that said, the highlight was definitely the main - Angus beef short rib, braised for 16 hours and served with asparagus and truffle polenta. The beef paired wonderfully with a glass of Amarone from Verona, not to mention that the meat was so tender that it just about fell off the bone - masterful! We topped it all off with a scrumptious vanilla meringue for dessert. We've never left Bistro Soori unsatisfied - eating here is always a delight, no doubt we’ll be back soon to see what wonderful creation the chefs come up with next!tip: If you like to watch your food being made, be sure to snag a seat at the bar counter

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and presentation of the food. Everything was tasty and perfectly cooked. The ambiance was subdued because we dined late (9PM), but still fun. I was a bit surprised to see that they closed at 10PM on a Saturday night... An excellent choice in a very fun neighborhood

We recently discovered Bistro Soori while wandering around Chinatown, looking for somewhere good to eat. Set in one of the traditional Shophouses, inside the interior was sleek and stylish. We were there for their happy hour, which lasted from 7pm to 10.45pm and which included 2 for 1 on house pours and as it was a Thursday, it was also Martini night! For dinner, I ordered the Braised short rib with Mushrooms and spinach, which arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious. There was also an extensive set lunch menu with loads of great choices, so it looks like we’ll be returning very soon

We went to this clean & cool restaurant on a Saturday night, happy to find somewhere nice still taking reservations. The list of items not available included three things I had selected from the menu, a shame for a Saturday night.Our a la carte dishes arrived quickly and were really very good. I had chicken that was tender and tasty. The lava cake was well presented and delicious also. Presentation was exceptional.Two negative points: designer tables leave little room for non Asian shoe sizes; service not up to par with food. Will give it another try soon, hope the waitresses have made progress in the meantime

Because Esquina was full, I wondered across the street to this restaurant called Bistro Soori. The menu was interesting, so we decided to try the tasting menu. The food came quickly, and we were amazed by the quality and taste of the servings, it was a great discovery and we will most definitely come back. One more thing, the ambience was relaxed and well designed. It had an open kitchen and you can see the food being prepared. This is undoubtedly one of my best experiences in Singapore

Came here recently for the set lunch. Menu was quite extensive with plenty of interesting choices to tempt you. Service felt a little inexperienced: restaurant was virtually empty upon arrival and yet they chose to seat 2 tables in close proximity. Despite these minor issues the overall experience was positive and the quality of food very good for the price. I would be tempted to visit again

We followed the good advice of a family member and ate here on a recent trip to Singapore. Wow! Beautiful modern food, great service and lovely ambience in a smart relaxed setting. All our dishes were excellent, great combinations of flavours and beautiful presentation. The staff and management are doing a wonderful job of offering interesting food in a city full of great restaurants, bistro soori is certainly worth a visit and we look forward to going back

We tried (again) to get into Burnt Ends and failed. It was early so we wandered around too see what else was around and stubled across Soori. Menu looked nice and good value. Staff were lovely. Service was speedy and food was delicious. We were given complimentary bubbles to start and limoncello to finish a very enjoyable, al fresco meal. Thoroughly recommeded

A dining experience out of this world was had at bistro soori. I visited Bistro Soori on a Friday night with my husband and mother (who was visiting from Australia). The ambiance in the restaurant was very relaxed and the deco was modern and chic. We had the set menu which included entree, main and dessert for $62++. This was extremely reasonable for the quality of the food. 10 out of 10 for taste and presentation. Every dish that was served was impeccably presented and we could not fault a single dish. I can't recommend which dish to try as they were all amazing. We had the scallops and also the tuna entrees, seebass and also lobster mains and the creme brulee and chocolate pudding for dessert. Again 10 out of 10 for the service. Each server was extremely professional and friendly. Great experience all round and highly recommended!!! I'm already making a booking for my next visit.

Had a business lunch today. Ordered the pan-grilled miso scallops which was delicately delicious especially with the chef's special sauce. Had the duck leg confit which was non-fatty as the skin was crispy fried. Chocolate mousse dessert completed the entire delightful dining experience here. Bar counter seating is interesting as you watch the chef prep your meal in front of you

Have been hearing more and more good things about this place so went to try it out tonight with some friends. Three of us tried the 5 course tasting menu, the other three a la carte - every single mouthful of every dish was phenomenal. We ate and drank like royalty and were surprised after what great value the bill was. The waiters and senior staff were the best I have come across in singapore. Definitely worth a visit. I will be going back for sur

Little is said of Bistro Soori so I was prompted to pay it a visit after reading a positive review in the KrisFlyer magazine. Like many new eateries in Chinatown, Soori is set in an old shopfront building but has a modern welcoming interior. Patrons are greeted by a big bar area giving diners ring side seats and views of the kitchen at work. There are also plenty of tables for those who prefer eating at a table or for larger groups. Staff are welcoming but not overly fussy so a good balance is maintained. The menu gives a good range of offerings which should accommodate most tastes and palates. The wine list is less broad and a little on the pricey side. The cuisine is very good contributing to an understated but excellent experience

We found Bistro Soori from a food blog and for want of anywhere else to of decided to go there for Friday lunch. When we arrived the greeting was friendly and the place was very quiet but with a cool minimalist ambience. None of this gave any hint as to the superb cuisine this restaurant serves up.We opted for the set lunch - often a source of deep disappointments in other establishments- and we were blown away. From the espresso cup of tomato soup to the scallops in pistachio sauce and the fish of the day,everything was delicious,superbly presented and delightfully subtle.The pandan soufflÃ© as the desert was simply stunning in its lightness and subtlety.Bistro S is not the easiest place to find its true but once you do you will become a fan. We will be going back for dinner very soon.Lunch for two incl. the inevitable plus plus was S$87 and worth every cent.

so i came here because my friend said it might be good and the website looks pretty decent and we needed a place for an almost xmas meal. very unpretentious place with mostly young working adults and people who just wanna talk loudly, talk rubbish and laugh like crazy. service is pretty 'glacial' as mentioned in another review here and my sch teacher friend said the waitress was 'fierce'. i had the festive menu at 98++ and to be honest it is rubbish. the idea of a lot of food made me order it but my friends who had ala carte were happier in the end. both their mains were salty and it is just very mediocre food trying to look creative and cool on like a black tile thing. they gave a soup that was baby in size and the spoon was baby as well and it is really too small for even my asian mouth. definitely not value for money and i'll rather have chili crabs and get my hands dirty
