The food and service is good. It taste like hong kong style cooking. The ambience is comfortable, however there are small flies in the restaurant.
5
The service is excellent and catered for family gatherings. Child friendly restaurant and great servings. Definitely be back again

The dim sum was average. Porridge was almost tasteless with no sweetness & savoury of the ingredients so will not recommend. The banana toffee 1st order was great but a 2nd order was disappointing, it's not consistent.
4
We had the Dim Sum Set for lunch. $16.80 better per person, inclusive of tea and wet towel. Value for money.
4
chinese food was very tasty and good value. The 4pax set was very filling (duck seemed like neverending portions) but surprising good as well. Worth a return visit
5
Peking duck was exceptional. Skin was crispy and duck meat was soft and juicy. Lucky 8 is a really gem!

I was impressed by the flexibility from Ms Tiffany who took my call for reservation. Some of my family members cannot eat prawns, so I requested to change the dish and Ms Tiffany helped me to change to scallops with asparagus. Most of the restaurants would have charged an extra fee for change of dish, but Ms Tiffany did me a great favor by acceding to my request at no extra charge. The food met the standards of a premium Chinese restaurant, however, I felt that the waiting time for the food to be served should be shorter, as all of us waited about 25 minutes before the first dish was served. But overall recommended for a great family meal

We went to lucky 8 restaurant for a family dinner. We bought a set meal for 5 persons and the food came out excellent. Especially the Peking duck, it will make u want to come back for more. The price is reasonable and the service staff are all very friendly and efficient. I would definitely come back again

Restaurant was quiet on a Sunday evening which is a harbinger to come. Roast pork was cut too chunky,sharkbone soup was more to the side of salty than umami. Special offer of deep fried soonhock...the fish must have been in the chiller for more than a couple of days. Dishes that were ok were Irish roast duck and four seasons french beans.

Great location in the heart of the Orchard Road shopping belt! Tasty dim sum and reasonable banquet set menus for 4, 5, 6 people.Lunches are busy, but dinners are easy to get any table.I would recommend it as a break in your shopping spree
5
Great food and service. The dim sum servings were a good portion, especially the porridge. The ingredients were fresh. Real comfort food.
4
It's been awhile since I've gone to this restaurant & I'm glad we had lunch there recently. Food was good and serving portion decent for the price. Nice ambience adds to the dining experience too.
A restaurant you should visit for good dim sum üëç

Food was average - duck meat (from Peking duck dish) was too salty. Ambience is normal and typical for Chinese restaurant. Staff were attentive.. probably bcos only few customers surprisingly even on a Sunday night. Overall dining experience- nothing to shout about.
5
I had the clay pot meal for two. It was very generous and delicious. I ordered 2 meals and 4 of us had more then enough. From starter to dessert all the dishes were delicious.
4
Went with my family for dinner. Staffs are friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is relaxing & the food is good though slightly expensive. Overall, an enjoyable experience.
5
Exquisite and high quality Cantonese/Chinese food, with warm, attentive service that reminds me of good, classy Chinese restaurants. Definitely a place I'd revisit.

We had dim sum here on a Sunday morning. The food was good, overpriced for what we got, although given the central location of the restaurant and the posh building we can understand. The only weird/frustrating thing was that we wanted to take away the leftover custard bun and egg tart from our meal, and the staff would not allow us to take them out of the restaurant because "it was a promotional rate." It only one piece of each, it wasn't like we ordered tons of them and asked to take them away. Two pieces of food, and they would rather throw it away than allow us to eat them later. It is this exact type of rigidity and nonsensical insistence on rules that typifies the Singapore experience for visitors (of which I had two in my party.
4
Came here for lunch with colleagues at around 12:20pm. Wasn't packed and didn't require reservation.The char siew was the best dish on the menu for me. Soft and savoury sweet. Did not really find the roasted pork as good but my colleagues liked that too.The Char Siew Su and Bo Cai Shrimp dumplings were good as well. I would definitely order these again if I return.Other items like custard buns, beef guo tiao and stir fried vegetables were decent, though the buns' skins were too dry and guo tiao too oily and lacking flavour (but beef was flavourful and soft).Century egg porridge was so-so, Crystal Jade porridge dishes are better

Tucked away in an area of Shaw House hidden from view from any entrances, this family restaurant is a good option for Chinese cuisine. Food is above average and service is great. Staff are friendly and helpful with recommendations, making your meal all the more enjoyable. They have their regulars and the place is usually packed over weekends and festive seasons. Lucky to have chanced upon the restaurant

Went for dim sum lunch. Food was quite good. But I have to mark down on the dough and skin parts of the dim sum. For instance the skins of the char siew pao, custard buns, har gau and cheong fun were a bit soft and lacking the chewy texture. The filling of the custard bun was good. The BBQ and roast pork were good. Served reasonably good guanyin tea at $2 per person. Complimentary dessert was a nice touch. Service was good. Pricing was in the mid to high range. Reasonable choice for dim sum in Orchard Road area
1
Food are not nice and the service are terrible. Tea is very diluted. Waitresses are rude and when they poured the tea and spill on us , they didn't apologise.
3
Thought have Dim Sum buffet promotion as advertise in their webpage but upon arrival was told promotion over. Pretty disappointed that their website was not updated. Hence order ala carte but lesser dishes as without promo is expensive.
4
Went to Lucky8 for Mother's Day celebration. They had just opened for the day. Some dishes were better than others - the ËêùÂçúÁ≥ïÔºåÊµÅÊ≤ôÂåÖ and ÁÉßËÇâ were good.
5
Nice yummy food. They have daily dish offer which is worth the price. We ate Soon Hock fish for only $28 thereabout. Service was excellent & we were given complementary dessert. I love complementary. Will visit the restaurant again.
4
Quite a good place. Food was decent and reasonably priced. Esp for town area. Will return. Atmosphere is so so
5
Nice setup, delicious food. Waitress is also observant enough to switch my cutlery around when she noticed that I am left handed.
We ordered the Peking duck set and it was very nice!

good food and the service was great. service staff was attentive and made the dining experience memorable

My wife and I went for my wife's birthday. To start this review, trying to research the menu on line was extremely difficult, very limited info and no prices available anywhere as such I sent the restaurant an email asking girl this info. They called me but were unable to help, but I bit the bullet and booked anyway.My first thought when finally getting to see the menu was gee, pricey... We ordered three dishes, inc the pork belly speciality, chicken and chilli in Jing Kong sauce and seafood noodles (which was the highlight).The meals were nice and the hostess did surprise my wife by presenting her a happy birthday dish which really changed my initial price apprehension to appreciating the gesture, my wife loved the gift.There's plenty if staff and within an hour if arriving we'd fi usher, which was a little too quick fir a birthday celebration but that seems to be the Singapore way.I'd come back again, with different expectations

@TheKuoKnowsI am so glad I went back to Lucky8 for another bite of the cherry.My first visit was a non-event. The restaurant was still having minor teething problems, having just opened its doors. But they have turned things around, completely.The food arrived promptly from kitchen to table. The Char Siu was top drawer, and the Char Siu Pao was both dainty and delicious.The Xiao Long Pao was only acceptable, though. It would have been better, if they had rolled the pastry a tad thinner.I enjoyed the Fried Beef Ho Fun, enormously. Plenty of wok-hei, plenty of flavour, plenty of beef.The waiting staff was superb throughout. They get top marks for attention to detail. And even higher marks for friendliness.Lucky 8 has made its intentions clear. It is a force to be reckoned with

Eight of us booked a private room and ordered their set dinner menu, after Service and GST is was S$75 per head, reasonable priced. The room was nice and service is good. However the cuisines are nothing special, standard Chinese cooking with MSG, even their signature 3 variety of roast pork was rather average. There are lot of great Chinese restaurants in town, this is definately not the one that I will go again
5
Service staff is friendly and attentive. Food is delicious and nicely plated. Was surprised to see the bill come up lower than I expected, given the quality of good. Very good value for money
5
great dining experience there with my family .definitely worth the try. good service and attentive staffs.
5
Staff service is very thoughtful, food is also very delicious, there are Hong Kong-style taste.I will come back here to enjoy my lunch

We had a yu sheng so that to catch up the last day of CNY. It was good I must say.
We then had some dimsum and seemed that nothing outstanding. Portioning wise is alright but with the price set on the menu...not really worth.
4
The restaurant location is central along The popular Orchard Road. Conveniently aceesible by car, taxis, Uber or MRT.
3
Food is decent but the set lunch is not really worth the money as they charge for many other miscellaneous like plain water ($2!!!), wet towel ($1) and really not so nice pickles ($2 for a few cucumber and carrot sticks) Service is good though but the aircon is bit too strong and most of the food turned cold within minutes serve
5
Located in Shaw Centre, the heart of Orchard, we walk directly from the MRT through Ion Orchard link, not seen a drop of rain even though it was raining heavily. The Roast Pork was fantastic, but the best dish we tasted was the Soy Sauced Chicken, so much better than some so call Micheline Star chicken that we tasted.Price is cheap, considering the environment and food quality, will definitely come back again

A group of us had dinner here on a weeknight. The service staff were attentive throughout dinner, probably because there were only a handful of tables with diners and we were the largest group there. Food was so-so, nothing memorable or out of the ordinary. I didn't find the roast pork outstanding although there were good reviews about this. Worst of all, we could smell cigarette smoke in the restaurant towards the end of our dinner although there was air-conditioning. When we asked the service staff to check on the smoke, they denied that there were people smoking. After our feedback, we noticed several kitchen staff walking out of the restaurant and we realised that they had been smoking in the kitchen and the smoke had wafted into the restaurant through the swing doors. Shortly after, the staff returned to the restaurant and we presume they must have gone out to continue smoking. For a restaurant located in the Orchard Road/Scotts Road belt serving fine Chinese cuisine, the way in which the restaurant handled this matter was disappointing
4
My friends from overseas wanted to do shopping and dine at Orchard road. As my friends wanted to eat Chinese cuisine but do not want to dine at a crowded restaurant, I chose Lucky8 due to good reviews. I must say that their food taste good. Ordered the combination meat platter. Seafood Claypot, etc
3
A large group of us gathered for CNY lunch here, in a private room.The service was most attentive. My teacup was never empty for more than a few moments.The Peking Duck is quite good, so is the steamed fish. The prawn salad should have been named "mayo salad with some prawn".Of the other eight dishes, I cannot remember anything good or bad..
