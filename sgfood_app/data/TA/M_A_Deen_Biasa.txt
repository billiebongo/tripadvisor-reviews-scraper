My first visit here and I was mighty pleased. Nice restaurant located in Jalan Sultan. The food quality is excellent, it’s freshly prepared. Thumbs up!!

Unique and tasty lamb with 14 types of spices, all recommended, don't look the interior focus on food, anytime you can ask the owner if you have questions, very client oriented.

Mee Goreng and Bee Hoon Goreng Ikan Bilis are super duper delicious. It's very tasty and portion is just nice. Open till late, so good for supper!

Located just 100 meters off the intersection of Beach Road along Jalan Sultan, this small corner restaurant serves delicious mutton soup or what locals refer to as sup kambing. The portions served is pretty generous with at least one bone marrow piece and lots of smaller mutton chunks in a thick tasty soup and comes with a complimentary bread to dip in and eat. Other than their mutton soup, their fried noodles is also pretty good.

Quieter than the stalls at Golden Mile where Anthony Bourdain devoured Sup Tulang with Robert Chin. The version here is not bad, with a generous helping of the sauce. But it is so messy that it’s best to savour it at home, so you can slam the bones hard to get the marrow out, toast the bread a bit before dipping it in the rich sauce, and go wash your hands often. Other dishes are below average, so just focus on the red stuff

The red color basically came from food coloring but the taste was good. Make sure you wore some gloves before eating as you will need to use your hand to truly enjoy the sup merah.Price was good and worth it.Dip the bread into the soup and savor the taste

The first time I went there was when I was just passing by and from the corner of my eye I saw people eating something big and colorful and it looked like meat. I just had to stop and check. It was big mutton bones in a soupy kinda gravy with soft bread. So I ordered one. I was expecting it to be spicy as the color was red and inviting but it's more on the sweeter side. But, I absolutely loved it!Every time I visit Singapore I just have to have their Soup Tulang. They are open till very late. So after your day is over, get a foot massage, head out for a small walk in the by-lanes of Arab Street, and stop by at M A Deen for their awesome Soup Tulang

Well this is my second time here. My 1st was on 6th january 2014. I love it, the red bones soup is great eventhough I do think somehow they have lower their standards. The soup seems to be a little bit lighter compare to my previous one

This place serves various mutton based dishes, but most people come here for their Soup Tulang (bone sticks with a little bit of meat and bone marrow inside, served in exotic tomato red sauce, the amount of spiciness can be requested from zero to infinity). No writing can describe it, you have to go there and see how customers eat, if you drool then order it. If you are not sure about Soup Tulang, there's Mutton Soup (diced meat on thick soup) with savory taste and looks less intriguing.Always take hot drink after the meal, better for your stomach.Oh, the reason I gave 3 stars only is because I used to live in Singapore for many years and have tasted better soup tulang in the similar shops before. Unfortunately the quality has reduced over time, the meats was more tender back then and there's no missing marrow on each bones.Will come back next time and hope the quality will be improved

Taste - Good. Delicious food.Price - Fair price and very good portion. We ordered a little bit too much for only 4 of us and total was SG$36.50 Ambiance - Clean and cozy.That was (see pictures) food for at least 8 adults (there was bread too) and some of us skipped breakfast on the next day
