Good quality food and service to match. A little on the expensive side considering portion size and atmosphere.
5
Love the ambience of the restaurant! Not too crowded! The food was amazing! Service was really good! Thank you!
4
I love the seafood so muchhhhh. It’s flavorful yet not too creamy. They made sure the seafood are fresh and nicely prepared. Highly recommend!

Will definitely re-visit the restaurant again with friends and family members.
Great varieties of Italian food !!

Conveniently located next to MRT station. Food good but not outstanding. Papardelle dish recommended. Service is good. Price moderate.

Located in a shophouse before 6th Avenue, if you drive you need to park at Guthrie House.The owner is from Puglia and the chef is Italian too.The burrata Parma ham and rocket leaves not as good as the one from Rubato, mainly because it could do with more salad dressing and the burrata mainly salty and less soft.The prawns in bacon were average.The ravioli with mushrooms and truffles was good.My order of pappardelle was meant to come with pork sausage which was served with a traditional Puglia pasta, which was interesting to try. Not commonly available.The tiramisu and walnut almond tarte were both good.Corkage is $35

If you are looking for a delicious family-friendly Italian eatery, Caruso is a highly recommended stop away from the bustle of the city center. Helmed by Manager Leonardo and his friendly team of Italian and local chefs, Caruso recalls the understated small-town kitchens that might feature on a relaxed road-trip across Italy. Service is always warm and welcoming. Well priced home-style lasagna, pastas, seafood, pizza, grilled meats (charcoal grilled!!) and authentic home-made tiramisu round out a tasty menu, with something for everyone. Nice wine list too!
4
The restaurant is located near Six Avenue MRT which makes it quite accessible. I felt the dishes are Southern Italian style which was very delicious. Their burrata cheese was very fresh, and I recommend their Pizzas.Pastas also nice but you might want to say to add less salt when you order them.
4
Nothing outstanding .. in fact a little pricey but it was good. Octopus salad was good. Slow cooked lamb was OK - perhaps a little burnt on the outside. Tiramisu was also just OK - not amazing. Overall its OK if you just want something good and local - wouldn't suggest you travel far to get there. Again bottom line is good but overpriced
5
Visited three times and it's always as good as my first. Quite affordable price considering the portions of the food. Authentic Italian dishes which I very much enjoy, especially parmigiana. Personal service from the owner himself, Leonardo. This restaurant is a great choice whether for couples or big group. Wall arts are nice too :
4
Went there with a group of 18 people who all seemed to have good food and no complaints.
I had the Sunday brunch SGD48++ which gave a flavour of several dishes and no complaints.
Service was good and friendly. I will go back..
4
My third visit to Caruso was as good as the first. Food has been delicious every time. The warm reception and good service only adds to the overall experience.
5
Very family friendly atmosphere. The rocket salad and mussels were delicious. Pastas were also really good. We are definitely visiting again to try their pizza and other pasta dishes.
4
Been to this restaurant before.Good service and food. The Calamari was excellent. So was the beef cheek
5
So nice to have a restaurant like this as your local. Very warm friendly atmosphere backed up by superb authentic Italian. Often has a weeks special. Parma festival on this week. So hard to decide what to choose. Have never been disappointed.

Caruso Located at #01-01 791 Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 269764, Singapore Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. This restaurant offers authentic southern Italian food. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste, the highlight for me was antipasti, several type of pastas, and off course all were outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while & it didn't break the bank. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience, exquisite food and great wine selections. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine
4
It was my second time at the restaurant. The first time was a wine pairing dinner at a fabulous price of S$88++ per person. This time I went with 3 other friends, one of whom was gluten intolerant. But it didn’t matter because the waiter was very aware of which of the dishes were gluten free. For the quality of food we had, the price was very reasonable. The list of wine were very affordable and well selected. Embience and service were a delight
3
Visited caruso for our dinner. The Strascinati pasta and Pollo arrosto was best in industry. The place was very hot. I wondered that the restaurant was very busy but only two servers working. Our order was delayed for long time and I was looking for a superior but unfortunately I couldn’t find anyone. I feel pity for the service people but somehow they managed to handle the pressure with smile. Anyhow thanks to that Indian guy (Kumar) who made us feel comfort from starting to end. My only complaint is why don’t hire more servers for better service.
5
Probably the best Italian food that I have enjoyed outside Italy.Nice pastas, big portions, great antipasti, really good pizza... and the grill beef rib eye its top class.Very good wine list not overpriced, and friendly service.Top Restaurant! Surely one of my favourite now
5
Little and cosy Italian restaurant in bukith timah rd.Teh interior are very warm, great family styled personal service. Food was simple yet very tasty and authentic... great tasty southern italian pasta and very good grill meats.Wine selection very good and won't kill your wallet.Recommended for a weekly friends and family gathering
3
Ordered calamari rings , rib eye steak, seafood marinara. Calamari was good, portion was generous..steak was average . Seafood marinara was very average, tasted much better elsewhere.
4
Great place to taste something different from the usual Italian...
The owner from Puglia is a great host.
Orecchiette pasta are delicious! Must try
5
Caruso's is the epitome of Italian. Fabulous fresh authentic food. Using the freshest and seasonally available ingredients this restaurant never fails to deliver.
Welcoming to all, great with kids, there is always something interesting to try.
Just at the top of 6th Avenue.
5
Absolutely delicious pasta, pizza & burrata.. Warm ambience, quick service & really welcoming feel. This will become a family regular !!
4
We were happily surprised at the quality of the food at Caruso. The cannelloni was particularly good. Reasonable range of wines too
3
Service was decent .my rissoto with ham and porcini and foie gras was very good . But my wife and younger daughter had the scallops . It was very disappointing to say the least , The scallops were rubbery and overcooked . That spoiled the evening somewhat. The tiramisu while decent did not have enough liquer but the panna cotta was good . So overall some what variable in quality and hence experience
4
The food was a positive suprise: fresh, authentic italien cuisine that tastes extremely good. The owner is Italian and that clearly shows. The only minus was the service: not very attentive. It looked like it was a burden to work there...We made the mistake to take a taxi from city center. Better us to use MRT / blueline. The station 6th Avenue is right around the corner
5
We happen to come here after unsuccessfully locating another Italian restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the dishes...fresh mozzarella, salads, and pastas.We enjoyed the mushroom stuffed ravioli and beef lasagna.The wine selection was also good and we enjoyed the Primitivo red wine.We would highly recommend Caruso for some fine Italian foo
4
This cafe was an incidental discovery for my husband and I some months ago when we had time to kill before our spa appointment. But since then we've been coming back for yummy pasta and pizza. The ambience is authentically Italian and the waiters are knowledgeable of the food they serve (always a plus).
5
The food, service, the ambience. It isn't like other restaurants with too much of social media publicity but the food never fail me/ anyone that I brought. Absolutely authentic. I like to stay at second floor. Oh yea, I ordered sea bass, my friend ordered pasta and tiramisu. They were just so fine
5
An authentic Italian restaurant. Such a hidden gem (perhaps for me, without realising it). Love it so much for the fresh pasta and pizza. I believe I will become one of the regular customers!
5
Amazing fresh tasy pizza's. Real Italian atmosphere with a Italian owner who loves to see you in his restaurant. Nice wine and good desserts.
Cosy place close to MRT station Sixt avenue
5
Popped in on route home. Midweek, not too busy but friendly attentive staff. Great fish soup. Will definitely return.
5
Couldn't be more impressed. Great menu, great atmosphere, great value. Highly recommended. Will be back.
5
Had an excellent night out at Caruso's with my friends to celebrate my birthday. Had never been before but will most certainly visit again. We were made to feel very welcome and the whole evening went down a treat. Leonardo was an excellent host & his sugestion for my main course was a deilght
4
Although the restaurant is not in the best location ever (Bukit Timah road, close to 6th Avenue) the restaurant itself is inviting and charming.A Relaxed family atmosphere, authentic good food.To start we had carpaccio (good), buffalo mozzarella (good), homemade tomato soup (superb) and the rocket and pear salad (fresh, well put together)Then for main a kids pizza (excellent, very good size, tasty, good quality), cannelloni (very well done, quality home cooking) and ravioli with ricotta and spinach (also good), the table behind us has the pasta with mushrooms and truffle and we could hear then raving about it!Agree with other reviewers on the service. A very attentive Italian in front of house, really watching and orchestrating the service. Pannacotta for dessert, very generous portion.All in all a very good easy evening out. If you live in the area give this one a go

Been to Caruso many times. It's not the very best Italian restaurant in Singapore, there are some better but they are also more expensive. What brings us back time and time again is the owner. Leonardo is just such a friendly guy, you can't help but feel welcome and special here. The other staff tend to be just ok, nothing wrong with them, but it's Leonardo that really creates the atmosphere here. My wife and I love the ribeye, which is a generous size and excellent for the price. The mussels in white wine and the lamb are also great choices. The pastas are good too. The only dish I've not really liked here was the lasagne. Great for groups, families or couples. Parking is a bit limited directly outside, although there is parking below Cold Storage off sixth avenue. It is also right next to the sixth avenue MRT on the new downtown line so very easy by train and a great option if you want to enjoy a few drinks. They also host wine tasting evenings regularly.
5
Its now probably one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore.Just off the sixt avenue in bukit timah, a small charming restaurant that offer real classic Italian food, at reasonable price and with a very top service from the owner Leonardo.Strongly recommend all the Puglia specialty dishes.

We have previously dined at this restaurant on several occasions and found it most enjoyable: good menu and wine list with delicious food. So we were looking forward to returning for another enjoyable evening. Sadly, on our recent visit the restaurant failed to deliver.After several mouthfuls of my risotto I discovered one large and several smaller stones as well as grit. To his credit, the manager reacted quickly and offered to replace the dish. But by this time my husband was well on the way to finishing his meal and, worried that I had broken a tooth, my appetite had all but diminished. Rather than leave, we wanted to give the restaurant the chance to redeem itself. However aside from preparing a fresh risotto - my husband had long finished by the time it arrived - there was no further effort to recover the situation i.e. there was no offer of compensation such as a free dessert, glass of sambucca / limencello or discount on the bill. We were charged full price for what ended up a very disappointing evening.Sadly, we are now reluctant to return. Why do restaurants become so complacent
5
Very unique Italian restaurant. Leonardo the co owner is from apulia so the food is unique. We have been coming here for years and he always welcomes us with a drink to start. The food is different than the food you get in other Italian places in Singapore. The wine list is nice with several apulian wines, try the Il Falcone made from the nero di troia. Awesome staff that have all been there forever.
4
My wife and I have made many trips to Italy. Caruso strikes us as been authentic. It's simple, honest and true to Italian cooking. couldn't ask for more. Unpretentious and genuine.
4
Food is delightful. Fresh and staff have good knowledge of menu. Would definitely return and place well worth a visit. Happy hour before 8pm on night we attended. Just go:)
5
Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great food and if you go there now you can ask Leo the white truffles that are in season. Forget all those fancy named so called Italian restaurants in Singapore this the real deal.
3
Nice atmosphere , friendly service with a smile. I was not lucky with my steak , the pizza was ok and the pulpo salad was also ok . Not the best italian in the area but ok food with a very friendly service .
3
Although the setting is not too appealing, the food is good and the wines are beautifully chosen. The manager is attentive. The only thing we did not like much is pizza, but the pasta and calamari were nicely cooked.
5
Traditional south italian dishes. High quality. Not inexpensive. Very kind personnel. Easy parking. Great place overall

We have driven past this place many times as it is near where we live and we never realised it was a restaurant as the signage is pretty poor and suggests a massage parlour rather than a Restaurant, so we were very surprised to find it was one when on foot outside..... So we had to try, of course, and what an experience!!! To think it had been open 2+ years and what we had missed in that time. We wanted to have just a simple lunch but from looking at the menu we were hooked and it developed into a feast. The owners/manager (very friendly) are all from Puglia and there is a trend towards that cuisine. Gosh! Another Italian nearby when there are already about 8.We started with a Puglia ante pasta that included an excellent burratino, tasty melanzani parmigiano, veal carpaccio with a beautiful tuna sauce and wonderful paper thin slices of zucchini wrapped around ham. An unusual combination that worked. We also had asked for a beef carpaccio as we were now intrigued to see what they could do. It was up there with the best we have tasted, but as we had ordered too much food that is now part of our take away for tonight.... We do not usually do take away, but this was just too good to leave behind. So far so good and we were so pleased we had found another very good restaurant near us. However my wife noticed they had a specials menu for the day. On it there was fresh white truffle tagliolini. The waitress enthused over it, so die, die must try. We ordered it to try. We were very lucky as white truffle had just arrived and the resulting pasta dish (tagliolini) was superb with plenty of truffle sliced onto it in front of us. It was the equal of the best truffle pasta I have ever had and a very fair price of $58 for two. (Other dishes were much more reasonable, especially with the dish sizes, which is why we put the restaurant as moderate rather than expensive.) $58 for a shared dish was an excellent price considering how much truffle they shaved onto it. We were in heaven and already planning our foodie group dinner there. We will be back many times from now on. This restaurant went from very good to sublime!! If only their sign had indicated it was a restaurant we would have eaten there regularly. PS Service was excellent, knowledgeable, pleasant and not too intrusive. Wine list is interesting and well chosen. They have representative wines from the different regions including one of our favourites done with the Ripasso technique. We will have that when we return for dinner sometime, an excellent near but not quite Amarone, and half the price. We had a bottle of their Pinot Grigio, as it was lunch, and it was very good. Sometime I would like to try the Puglia wines that are well represented but I am less familiar with

Been meaning to hit this strip for a while, and on a Monday night, this was the only place open. And with a $7 per glass happy hour, we were immediately on side. The Buffala di Parma wasn't great, but it was good. But the Pizza Puglia with burrata was fantastic. The first pizza with rocket where it didn't feel like someone dumped a boring salad on top of an average pizza. In fact, the burrata on the pizza was delectable, definitely worth trying.
4
We were there on the last night of restaurant week. My daughter who is allergy to wheat and did not eat the options given in the menu, was pleased that the operator take great length to accommodate her diet. I love the seafood marinara as it tasted the same as those I loved in Italy. Would visit again. Authentic Italian foo

Came here for the Restaurant Week dinner. The staff was attentive and catered to our special request for seating.Appetizer: Zucchini stuffed with seafood - The tomatoes and seafood were a hearty accompaniment to the zucchini. Yummy!Main: Ribeye steak with porcini and truffle sauce. Delicious! Truffle flavour was distinct. Roast potatoes crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Steak was slightly rarer than requested, but it was still alright. Dessert: The tiramisu was good as recommended. Panna cotta had a good creamy flavour but could have been more set.Overall, a warm friendly place for hearty and delicious Italian fare. Thumbs up! :

I have eaten regularly at Caruso with my family. Everyone is friendly, the service is great. The food on the menu has every Italian dish you could dream of. I would recommend this for anyone. Go there if you can it is amazing

When we came into Caruso for lunch, we felt the atmosphere very cozy, relaxing and pleasant. The interior is simple, but tastefully decorated. Service was efficient and friendly. The restaurant is run by Italians, so very authentic. We each asked for completely different dishes only to see how good the cook was about variety. The pizza was amazing and of perfect size for someone hungry! The dough was not too thin and it had the perfect consitency. There was no sparing ingredients and it was well-served on the basil and artichokes. I hate those pizzas that claim having basil and you only get one leaf per slice. I asked for a pasta made with crab (not sure what the name was) and it was made with a tomato based sauce. The pasta was perfectly al dente and it was delicately seasoned. Simply delicious! The other dish we asked was the ravioli, which was also very nice. We got desserts as well and it was all perfect, both the pana cota and the chocolate cake with ice cream. Caruso's menu is built with courses, but, since we were not that hungry, we only ate one dish each. However, for a hungry person the dishes (apart from the pizza) might not be enough for a complete meal and you might have to add a salad or soup. 3 main dishes, 3 desserts and 1 bottle of sparkling water were about 140 SGD, a little on the pricey side. If we had asked for full courses and wine, well, that would have been a bit expensive. It's important to mention, though, that food ingredients are very expensive in Singapore and I had the impression that Caruso is using the best ingredients in their dishes. The most important thing is that we all felt good after the meal. The food was light and contained substance. We'll certainly return. And if you are visiting Singapore, It's a good idea leaving the touristic center for a meal at Caruso in Bukit Timah. You'll certainly not get the blend touristy kind of food you get at Orchard

Had dinner in late Nov '14 with a group of friends who eat there regularly. Had several dishes. Most impressive was the pizza and eggplant lasagne. Least was my pasta. I think the sauce was a bit watered down. Service was very prompt and attentive. Met other friends there too. Apparently they are all regulars of this restaurant
4
I came here for an Italian wine and food evening with some friends and had a fantastic evening of food, wine and company. The food was all carefully prepared and in true Italian style and the wines all came from local family run vineyards and complimented the food well. It's not downtime so it wasn't wonderfully convenient for me but the best Italian food I've had in Singapore by far
4
We were here for dinner on a Monday evening and was greeted by Leonardo. Since it was our first time here, we asked him to make some food recommendations for the appetiser and mains. We loved the seasonal appetiser of salmon rolled with cheese. The carpaccio of yellow fin tuna with lemon zest was ok but not fantastic. For the main course, we tried the Pizza Caruso (surprise pizza from the chef). We liked the generous toppings of spinach, cheese, and other stuff. The seafood pasta was great too. For dessert, we had the tiramisu (which was highly recommended) and the chocolate tart. The chocolate tart was a little dry. Overall, we enjoyed the food and would come again. On the downside, I must say that the layout of the restaurant being long and narrow made the distance between tables rather close. With the bar counter located at the front, the larger tables were situated at the back of the restaurant. All the guests were seated on level 1 and it was a little noisy as there were 3-4 groups of people having dinner at about the same time
4
This restaurant is close to where our family are living and we visited it twice during our stay. Both times the food was very good and the service ( not something that is highly acclaimed in Singapore) was first class. Classic Italian cuisine with featured nights offering a variety of dishes.Special mention to Denesh who had just started work and was very attentive and helpful during our visit. There are several Italian restaurants within walking distance but for me this is the best of the bunch
4
Was here for dinner on a Monday evening and the restaurant was about half full. Could tell that they were very short staffed but the staff tried their best to make us feel taken care of.Food was pretty good, we had the starters to share between us (abt 60bucks), squid ink pasta and also the dessert platter to share. The bill amounted to around 150 bucks which in my opinion is pretty reasonable for the quality of food served. Their tiramisu is really really good stuff and I highly recommend it. Will be back again.

The audacious and inspiring Travelling Gourmet goes to meet...MASTERFUL Caruso on Bukit Timah Road...Caramba! Caruso is not the famous tenor Enrico Caruso but rather a new authentic Italian Ristorante and Pizzeria specialising in Pugliese spezialitati from the "Heel" of Italy. Mio amico Leonardo Palmisano from Alberobello in Puglia welcomed me warmly, "Benevenuto Il Turista Buongustaio!" Il Turista Buongustaio means The Travelling Gourmet in Italian. The two Chefs furiously cooking in the open kitchen at the back of the restaurant, Mario and Mimmo are also from Puglia. If you feel energetic, simply climb 17 steps to the upstairs dining area. Nostalgic framed photos dot the walls. I like the black and white pictures of Sophia Loren smoking, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on a Vespa scooter in the hit movie "Roman Holiday" and many more...I began with Burrata con Tartufo Nero or Soft Cheese with Black Truffles. The aromatic and heady aroma of Truffles sent me into an ecstatic dream of more gourmet delights to come. Try too the Burrata with Salmon accompanied by lettuce and cherry tomatoes.Lovely Lamb as a main course cooked in the Italian style, Orecchiette Pasta with Seafood or with Meat are really satisfying Piatto secondi! I always like Orecchiette, the typical ear shaped pasta of Puglia. It must be served 'al dente' or firm to the bite in the middle. Once, 1 Michelin Star Chef Antonella Ricci taught me how to make Orecchiette using the thumb to make the depression. Orecchiette actually means "little ear" in the Italian language.Dessert selections include that ever popular Titamisu made with Marsala wine. Tiramisu means literally "pick me up". Panna Cotta which is actually cooked cream is much loved by the natives in Italy. After the Dolci, an Espresso is de rigeur followed by some Grappa and Limoncello as a 'digestivo'!I love Italian food and wine and Grappa, for eg. Nardini Grappa. I've been to Italy on gourmet safaris so many times, my friends say I'm more Italian than Singaporean! I was just in Italy in April this year for Vinitaly 2014 in Verona. Many restauranteurs in Asia and Italia even call me "Il Padrino Gastronomico" which means in English...The Godfather of Gastronomy.As I left after a superlicious meal, I promised myself to return soon...the song "La Donna e mobile" from Rigoletto echoed in my mind. It means "The woman is fickle" and it was one of famed tenor Enrico Caruso's favourite Arias...Buon appetito! Ciao! :-

I m impressed by the number of Italian chef here. About 4-5 of them. Love the 'surprise' pizza, its like tell them what u want or dun want n thy will give u a surprise. The toppings are generous I must say. Tried the Porcini mushroom pasta, its quite good although I am not a creme base person. However, we were quite disappointed with the meat platter which costs $65++. The beef n pork were over-cooked. The lamb rack is very good n I loved it!!!

Dined here recently on a busy Friday evening. Made a reservation while I was driving to the restaurant and thank god they had a table as we were quite early. We were welcomed cheerfully and given a choice to choose for seating as we were the first to arrive for the evening. Complimentary bread was given out after we placed our order. We ordered pizza bread for starters, cream of mushroom soup, mushroom risotto, carbonara for mains tiramisu and chocolate tart with ice cream for dessert.The cream of mushroom soup was very fresh and delicious. The mushroom risotto was one of the best I had. Perfectly cooked! My wife's carbonara was tasty too. It wasn't too creamy or too watery. The tiramisu was one of the best. Perfect texture and right amount of mascropone cheese and marsala wine. The chocolate tart was warm and fresh with a scoop of tasty vanilla ice cream.Overall it was a pleasant experience and the food was above average and reasonably priced. The ambience was nice and the service was good. I noticed that they have a bar and wine cellar with variety of wines and liquors but they didn't have any mocktail in their extensive drinks menu. It would be great if they serve mocktails and more non-alcoholic beverages
