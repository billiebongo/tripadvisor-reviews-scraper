Had dinner her first night. Food was good and staff were friendly and helpful. Has the chilli crab pasta which was great. Website had mentioned soft shell rehab but that was not on the menu when I went.

When I arrived at the Sultan, late in the evening after 14 hours of travel, the staff of this little Caf√© were kind enough to stay open a bit longer to take care of me - and the chicken teriyaki was great!

set up Classified Cafe in November 2015. With only 1 goal in mind, to bring halal food to a even more fine and adventurous food trill.

It was my second visit to Classified Cafe. Having experienced a great first visit, I arranged to have our Anniversary Dinner here. As my husband is well-travelled, it is challenging to have him be blown away with a main dish without comparing to some of the best he has tasted all over USA and Europe. As such, I am glad that he loved Chef Arthur's Chili Crab dip and the Lamb Rack, done perfectly to his requested medium-well. It was a pleasant surprise too that Chef gave us a complimentary dish due to the time taken to serve our Lamb Rack. We were most appreciative as it was not even a very long wait and we were enjoying the cozy cafe atmosphere. Our sincere compliments to Chef Arthur for being so thoughtful and the delectable meals thereafter. We were pleased with the special dinner buffet menu served as it was really quality of the dishes and not quantity/variety that matters. (please check out their website and FB for full menu/prices too)We were also very pleased with the service from Zizie and Aces; they were the epitome of excellent service standards. Kudos to Mr Eric Toh for having them in your team! Really love the cosy decor of your quaint Cafe (those inspiring messages all over the cafe are a wonderful read) and we hope to be back again as hubby would really like to try Chef Arthur's Ribeye and I look forward to trying your other mains/risotto/desserts. All the best to Classified Cafe and we hope that you will enjoy the good fortune that comes with serving the best for your customers!Best wishes,Mr and Mrs Shamps. Thank you for providing access to the prayer room; these little touches and due consideration made a visit to Classified Cafe uniquely special and convenient
