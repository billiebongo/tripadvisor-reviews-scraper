New place between bars in nice area.
You can enjoy a glass of white wine and relax in the sofa.
We hope they will offer soon the restaurant, after chat with the Manager we will provide Japanese food.
We will come back, try it !

nice concept but food was average only. I think they were trying to do, too many different japanese food at one go, ramen and bbq food, which both are nice but not exceptional. good range of sake though.

Going to Mariko's is a pleasant experience every single time. The ambiance is cool with it's dimmed lights and minimal Japanese inspired decoration. The bar is the highlight, with a nice selection of spirits from all over the world and an amazing collection of whisks. The tapas sized food is great, a nice fusion of Japanese and Western, very well prepared. Thumbs up for Eddy and his fantastic drinks! I never check the menu as I always ask him to prepare something to surprise me and he never fails! The most creative, delicious drinks around. From its perfectly cold beer to the never ending choice of drinks, selected sakes, it caters to all tastes. There is always something exciting happening, different themes, good music, not too loud, which allows us to talk without shouting or dance to it. There is also an outdoors seating, our favorite! Mariko's is a great choice to eat, drink and have fun without hitting the night clubs

My girlfriends and I went to the The Cufflink Club (the bar beside) initially but because of the expensive drinks and impatient bar staff at Cufflink Club, we decided to leave and check out Mariko's Drinks were affordable, they have many interesting shooters and a wide range of sake as well. We had a few shooters, all which were priced at $10 nett.Mariko's had a DJ playing loungey tunes at the early hours and the music got more pumpy after midnight. Music was good and the DJ got the dancefloor going early on. Good mix of locals and expats. All in all, an excellent night out. Will be back for sure

except for the slimy drunked men. But hey it is a bar! I enjoyed the ambiance and the music with a few colleagues. The cocktail drinks such as "The Other Woman", which was loaded with ice and Lychee Saketini, were rather expensive and they were not the best. I have had some great ones in Clarke Quay restaurants row. Just drank beers after a few cocktails which were cheaper. What made this place awesome is Paul's band and Paul as a DJ.Yay

A mate who lives in Singapore suggested this place for a drink and whilst it started out a little quiet, things quickly picked up and the place was buzzing. The interior is really well designed with plenty of space and sitting outside is a great place to see the buzz of the local area

My second visit to Mariko's. Brought a friend there for dinner yesterday after a good meal with excellent service on my last visit. This visit was somewhat disappointing as the prawn gyoza skin was too hard, prawn tempura was just okay. The waiter delivered the wrong ramen but immediately exchanged it. The ramen with gyunyu soup was delicious! Ramen and yakitori are better choices. Service staff at the restaurant side seem overwhelm by the crowd. It took a long time to get our bill. Nevertheless, still a cool place to hang out for whiskey and sake with great music by DJ

This is a fun eating and drinking place with a Japanese flavour and Western influence! The space has an urban vibe but it's textures imply the cobblestones and weather board alleys of post war Japan.We started with hot from the pan tempura (prawns) followed by huge bowls of steaming ramen. Absolutely delicious! And good value! Then we moved to the front bar where the DJ spun his tunes into the night and our group relaxed with cocktails, Japanese beers such as Sapporo and Asahi, as well as Japanese sake.A great place to catch the buzz of Singapore's hip and happening nightlife
