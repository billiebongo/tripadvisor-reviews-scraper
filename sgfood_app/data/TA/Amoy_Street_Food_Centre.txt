Lot of choices of food to eat but we seldom go there as it is just too crowded and a lot of the famous stall has too long queue. The best timing to be here is before or after the peak weekday lunch hour
5
You cannot leave Singapore without visiting the Amoy Food Center. If you want to experience street food, go to Amoy, and you will not be disappointed. When can I go back ?
4
From affordable pasta that is cooked fast to all sort of local delights, you will be wowed but first learn to vow to queue no matter how hot or how long it takes
4
Look for the small queue - has a Michelin recommendation rather than Star but well worth a visit. Nicely presented and very good food
5
This is where you can find a choice of delicious hot oriental cuisine at sensible prices. It is always crowded and you need to have a plan of action when you go there. It's easy when you know how, step 1, find a table and claim it as your own, step 2, one of you go and order your food and get a ticket number and time. (Usually 5 minutes) step 3, get your drinks. Step 4, get your plates and chopsticks. Step 5, collect your food, site and enjoy. Best time to get there is before 7pm

Found this hidden gem in the midst of expensive Singapore. Initially we (4of us) weren’t sure if we would be ill after eating here or not but having read reviews on this food centre we thought we should give it a shot. So glad we did! Lots of small stalls to choose from with each one displaying the picture of the food you order. We opted for the Thai stall and there was plenty to choose from. Mostly fried rice with veg and chicken, beef or pork in mild and spicy versions. I’d say locals tend to eat later as most stalls were just opening around 7pm but if you want to save money but get delicious food while in Singapore I’d definitely visit this food centre. Top food!
5
Many option of cheap local food choices at this plaza. Cash only but theres atm close by. Most stalls close by 4pm when we arrived. There's also more stalls upstairs. Might not be most cleansing since theres pigeons that are on table eating out of leftovers
4
Stopped here on the advice of a tour guide but quickly found it was a popular lunch spot for local business people. For me, that is usually a good sign. That and finding the stalls with the longest lines. There were options for most palettes, including pasta, but I opted for the curry place about 2 rows in. Finding seating when it is busy can be a challenge but we managed. Be courteous and put your dishes on the proper trays when you are finished so that others can sit though :-

Love this hawker centre when I used to work in Tanjong Pager area. Please expected long queue during office hours, from 11.30am onwards. Must try the fish soup located in level 2. The auntie is rude but the food is awesome. Once you ate the fish soup at this stall, you will definitely missed the taste few days later. The fish is very smooth and fresh. The nasi lemak stall located near the staircase at level 2, is one of the best nasi lemak I ever have. Not oily, Chicken wing is crispy. They will close their stall around 1pm once they have finish their rice. The uncle is very friendly too

Amoy is a bustling hawker centre that is a good alternative to the nearby Maxwell. It is best enjoyed in one of two ways:1) pre or post lunch, dodging the very hectic office crowd2) lunch time, with a 'marker' to hold a table while you grab some food*As a hawker centre, I can't see why a tourist would seek out Amoy, but in passing it is a great choice: clean, fresh, high turnover, near many tourist attractions. I especially recommend the biriyani at $4.50. *many locals will leave something on a chair or table to hold/reserve a seat, you should do the same. It sucks to receive your food then walk around all flustered trying to find a seat
4
As all the Chinese food markwt very busy. Different choices for any kind of taste. Singapore can be pretty expensive, street food is your solution: it is just great.
Aroumd here there is another food street market called Maxwell foodcourt. I loved that one too!!!!
5
This is a place where you can a few michelin star food in one go and very affordable price. But be prepared that the place is crowded during lunch hour and you have to find and occupy the seats yourself.
4
Came to have dinner around 7pm and found all stalls at 2nd level were closed. Only some Indian and chinese food stalls were opened on the ground level. Not many choice to select. The place was still 40% packed with overtime workers.
5
Amoy food Hawker street is a real gem in the CBd area. Food here is so cheap compare to other places in the city. The only thing you need to bare is the non air con environment . I like the Nasi lemak on the second floor.
4
We read about this chef in a Singapore newspaper. He had gone back to having a stall at the Amoy Hawker Centre so we decided to suss it out. He has a very small stall but a perfect set up for food presentation. Everything is well organised with a large cool room, cook station out the back, serving up counter complete with computer & register. The food menu was not comprehensive but was ample for the sort of quick food we were looking for at lunchtime. It was a good serve, tasty & inexpensive. The service was friendly & quick. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
5
Me and my friend went to this particular Hawker Centre everyday during our stay in Singapore.Lots of Michelin bib gourmand stalls here :)We kept coming back for the Kaya toast every morning at Ah Seng (Hai Nam) Coffee, rustic and old school :)I love the signature Crispy Curry Puff (pastry with filling) at J2 Crispy Curry Puff, it doesn't look appetizing but i swear it's so good. I had to force my friend to try it and she said "it's so orgasmic!" hah
4
You will be spoiled for choices, with so many nice & cheap food here. Nothing much to add as compared to my previous review. Except that there are few new stalls which couldn't survive after few months.... If you don't know what to choose? Just go to the long queue stalls. You won't be wrong.
4
The hor fun and chicken wings are MUST at Quan Ji stall when you are at Amoy street food center. Hor Fun is available in only one size at $20, good for 4-5 pax. The fish soup is good to have if you still have stomach space for more. Usually long queue but its worth it.
4
This centre is huge and filled with office workers at lunchtime, luckily I got there just before the main rush around midday.Loads of stalls to choose from and there are two levels apparently, I didn't even make it to the upper one, so much choice on the lower one!I hadn't had a duck dish during my trip so opted for a duck noodle dish, just $3.30 for a large bowl of noodles, soft duck, tofu and thick sauce, a separate bowl held a clear soup. Delicious.You know a place is obviously good quality and good value when it is filled to the brim with locals.Point to note, if a seat has a business card or something else on it, someone has reserved it while they get their food, who knew!
4
This is not just any food court. Within it is a high concentration of stalls that has recently been awarded Michelin Guideâ€™s Bib Gourmand status, more than any other places. It gets pretty crazy during the peak hours, so come early (say at 11), and see if you can sample ALL of the Bib Gourmand in one sitting. - A Noodle Story- Famous Crispy Curry Puff - Hong Kee Beef Noodle- Hoo Kee Rice Dumplin
4
Do you want to try some Chinese Singapore street food this is a good place to visit. You will be among the locals.
To pay bring your loose change.
5
This is the best place to have lunch for office workers that worked in Raffles Place area. Some of the stalls have really Long queues during lunch hours. You should come here either before 1130 am or after 230 pm.
4
2 storeys of food stalls featuring popular local food and drinks.Many stalls are open for breakfast. Lunch on working days are crowded affairs. Long lunch queues are regular feature of this food centre. Business tames after office hours.Good cheap eats for travelers eager to sample Singapore favorites and savor local dining experience.The Han Kee's fish based meals are tremendous value. Think... meaty, chuncky fish slices and parts. Think fresh fish, clear soup. The fish porridge soup is hearty and clear. The fish head noodle's soup is slightly thicker and more robust. Good value. Be forewarned, however. Han Kee's staff are always busy and under pressure. Perhaps that is why they tend to be abrupt and grumpy. For example, when we asked for extra empty bowls, we were told rudely 'No'!Perhaps they can afford to be curt... since their business is practically booming
4
Breadfast & lunch here most of the time.Many stalls I like:GF:1st lane: chicken rice, duck rice2nd lane: ceo noodles, china curry rice with stewed pork & chicken chop3rd lane: zcf & yam cake, thai fd, char siew rice, beef kt, steam rice w pork4th lane: fried rice (not a well known stall & manned only by one elderly man)5th lane & 6th lane & upstairs I seldom go.... for no reason. Guess there are already too many choices in the front.Upstairs I like Lor mee & coffee stall near the stairs
5
This place had me at the first bite, and for 14 years whenever I get a chance to visit Singapore, I would come here and get my fix. Always a long line, but worth every minute of wait. So good that I almost didn't want to share this with you
5
An oasis in the middle of the central business district , cheap and hearty local food serve . Stall holders are friendly and good vibes if you want an authentic local Singapore dining experience . The lunch I had below cost 4 sgd . Can't get any better than that 
5
This is one of my favorite breakfast place, it's not as crowded in the morning and the price of the food is very reasonable for cbd. Love the soon kuay, carrot cake and yam cake at the last row of stalls on the 2nd floor. They pan fried the cake and it's really yummy.
5
I work around the area and go there for lunch at least three times a week! I have not tried all but I would recommend those that I've tried at Level 2:1. Han Kee Fish Soup (level 2) at the side nearer to the lifts - fantastic fish quality and soup. Only downside is the queue during lunch hours2. Koko mee (level 2) middle 3. Zhi Sheng (level 2) middle - cheap and home cooked mixed rice. Queue might be long but it moves fast!4. Batang fish @ 96 (level 2) - friendly lady and above average fish quality. If you do not want to queue for Han Kee and crave for fish soup5. Pepper Bowl (level 2)6. Tai Sheng Wanton Mee (level 2) near Han Kee - friendly man at the store with value for money foodNote: if I'm not wrong, level 2 is closed for dinner. Best timing to go would be early lunch hour
4
(超好面，和记肉粽，驰名香脆咖喱卜，桐记牛肉粿条), this four hawker centre is been award Michelin award 2016, I went here two time , and I only trying the curry po and 牛肉粿条and it is very nice and great value of money.I will come back again next time to try another two.
4
Very popular with locals during lunch time, Amoy Street is always bustling during lunch hours between midday and 2 pm. There is a large variety of stalls selling foods ranging from malay, indian muslim food, mamak, chinese and western. Food is cheap. It is covered with fans so there is a slight air flow. There is also taps at the back for washing your hands
3
This hawker center have a great selection of food at very affordable prices. Crowded during lunch time on weekdays. Recommended for tourist who like to try some local food.
5
Good stalls are mainly opened in the day. Recommend the fish soup stall - Han Kee, 2nd level. Pepper beef horfun, 2nd floor. wanton noodle - same aisle as the fish soup.
4
I randomly stumbled across this place and was pretty pleased. There is a good variety of cuisines served and prices are very cheap. It's not a popular tourist spot so the food is authentic local food.
5
Between 11:30 and 1:30, it's CRAZY busy. Every stall that's even half way good will have a significant wait. There are several very good local options (Fish Porridge, Noodles) as well as western options like Salads.
4
Not so tourists sighted with tourist guide as in Maxwell Road. There are a few gems I can recommend that you would find branches elsewhere. if you want to know which ones these are, just follow the long queues which starts from 1130am to 230 pm to cater for the office folks rather than tourists.Among the longest queues, nasi lemak 1st floor (sold out by 1135am likely due to many take out orders), the seafood soup stall upstairs, wanton mee(where q is 20-30 deep throughout lunch), down stair wanton, HK steam meat rice(true blue hongkonger), Thai food (true blue Thai lady cook), rice dumpling (we call ba chang) , local fried noodles. these are only a few !the one that I would not recommend fried kueh teow( far too oily). you can get the cheapest fruit juice from $2.20one unique Singapore habit you have to avoid being annoyed which does not happen anywhere elsewhere even in neighboring countries is people put tissue packets or name cards to secure seats nothwithstanding other who came earlier and in the queue are deprived of seating in priority I hope the Singapore Govt takes some effort to eradicate this "kiasu / fear of losing/ selfishness' habit of depriving seats whom came earlier n in the queue. This is not meant to offend but Singaporeans please don t take this habit overseas esp in the west as it can be seen as 'boorish
4
Amoy food centre is in the middle to CBD making it accessible to most people working around that area. There is a wide variety of food options available ranging from western to Malay, Chinese and Indian. Prices are reasonable.Like most food courts, it is naturally ventilated, so can get a bit hot and humid during afternoons.Also expect crowd, as the area has high density of offices.My favorite stores are:Salad store at ground floor, and wonton noodle store at level 2. ;

Michelin Food Guide features 4 stalls from Amoy Street Food Centre. Namely the curry puff (#01-21), Dumplings (#01-19), Beef Noodles (#01-39) and Ramen (#0-41).Visited today (Saturday) not many stalls are opened for business. Amoy Street is located in CBD where many offices operating on 5 days week. It will be crowded on weekday especially 11am - 3pm. This place is between Tanjong Pagar MRT station and Telok Ayer MRT station.It has a good varieties of food. Limited parking area. The potato curry puff ($1.20) is really tasty. Enjoyed
4
It's located near Tanjong Pagar MRT. It's my favourite place to eat breakfast and dinner during weekdays. But be careful during lunch on the weekdays, it's kinda nightmare (because you have to queue). I think everyone is going here since the price is relatively cheap and reasonable.My favourite place is : Chicken Rice, Porridge and also Mr Salad Mr Salad of course is my new favourite. They serve fresh veggies, even grilled chicken and grilled salmon with decent price. And my favourite dressing is Honey Mustard

2 floors of delicious options by a heritage rich neighborhood. 4.5 starsHighlights:- Black pepper beef hor fun: looked for the long lines and stood in this one. Loved watching them stir fry it in the big wok. Beef was tender, noodles were fresh, and gravy was peppery. 5 stars.- Carrot cake: this version seemed to have larger rectangles of the rice cakes, bit more sweetness, and eggs more in big pieces than mixed in. Loved it. 5 stars.- Chicken and rice: I'm not a fan of the traditional boiled version and here got the roasted and cha sui versions. Tender chicken was delicious and rice extra flavorful. Cha sui non pork to be halal was a trip with only difference in taste being thinner slices. 4.5 stars - Tonkatsu: my son loves this dish so we were excited for this find. He ate it all and hub said it was good too. 4 starsLowlights:- Layout: hard to navigate with the upstairs and downstairs. Lots of short rows with tables in between so lots of squeezing around.Love the hawker's fare and would be happy to try more here
4
There are many food centers in Songapore but if you happen to stay at the CBD and want to try the most authentic food icons of Singapore, thisi is the place - much better than the much much bigger Lau Pa Sat center in front of our Sofitel Hotel. Do not miss the Ho Kee rice-dumpling (bak-changs), the Char Kwee Tiauw and the Porridge. Don't come too early if possible, the earliest around 8-9 as only a few stalls are open before 8.
4
- popular with the office workets, expect long queues at some stalls
- recommended: porridge, lor mee (noodles in thick gravy)
- clean, well-ventilated
5
This is my favourite place to have good and inexpensive foods. Many varieties of food. Come and enjoy most of them are served local dishes.
5
Amoy street food centre is in the middle of the CBD where everybody comes for lunch on weekdays. Don't spend your weekend here, there is nobody. Look for long lines, than you're sure the food is good.
4
Amoy food court works quite long. We were there around 9 pm. and still it was possible to find open serving boxes. Seafood soup was very nice but be careful with a spice (do not add all what you get at once). The soup is a clear broth with fresh vegetables just added before serving. My friend from Singapore Food Safety Agency told me that they regularly testing hygiene of those shops and they give them scores from A (the best) to C. However the longest cues are always to the C shops as they are making most tasty staff - but all those places are safe to eat
5
This place is packed with delicious local hawker food, over a hundred different stores by mostly local singaporeans. This means its as local as you can get.Do take note during peak hours its hard to get a seat. How to choose the right stores you might ask? Just go for the longest queu
4
Every time I visit Singapore try to eat in one food center. For me food center makes better choice not only because of price but because I can see food and order even if I don't know the name. So I spend long time to go around stalls and always can find something tasty.Very recommended if you in the area
4
Me and my partner spotted the food centre and tired many stalls with differing success, but would definitely recommend a visit for a great street food experience. The stalls have food hygiene certificates for those a little nore cautious, and the people are lovely. the place is so diverse there is loads of authentic styles to choose from. The korean bbq was fantastic
3
I came across this stall that sells nasi lemak that always have quite a fair amount of crowd so i decided to give it a try since i am early for work.The stall is easy to find as it is on the 1st row when one comes up the stairs.Verdict: Nothing much to brag about.Price: Worth it; $3.00 for a plate of Nasi Lemak w peanuts ikan bilis, luncheon meat, fried egg and fish filletGood:- Food is fresh and hot, probably becos i came at 8.30am- Food is affordable About the food- Rice: This is one of the soul ingredients for nasi lemak. The grain is individual so they do not stick together. Good. Fragrance of rice is not really there. Does not have that strong coconut pandan leave aroma though it is quite nice to eat on its own.- Chili: Another soul for nasi lemak. The chili here is too salty. Does not have the chili taste. Over empower the rice when eaten together with the chili. And uncle is not very willing to give more.- Peanut ikan bilis: Nice but still too salty- Fried egg: nothing to comment but remind me of a store that sells economical bee hoon and mee stall downstairs that will ask if you like your egg to have cooked or watery egg yolk. I found that very thoughtful and hope more vendors can take note of that.- Luncheon meat: I think he pan fried it or deep fried it for just a short while so that it didnt taste HARD. This is tender- Fish fillet: Very soft and fresh and crispy. YummyFinal words: Nothing to brag about. But can try if you are variously craving for nasi lemak and cannot find one nearb

Lei Cha is an authentic Hakka dish, rarely found in food centres or restaurants. While I am not an expert who can cook this dish, but I can safely describe this dish as healthy yet delicious, full of nutrients and vitamin in a single bowl.Lei Cha is typically a bowl of rice (white or brown), topped with several types of sautÃ©ed vegetables such as cabbage, choy sum, chopped French beans, chopped tofu, peanuts, some times dried shrimp or dried anchovies. It is also served with a bowl of green soup, slightly salted and garnished with parsley. The soup is made of tea, basil and herbs; all grounded and mixed together. So you can see, this dish is packed with nutrients and antioxidant in a bowl! The right way to enjoy a bowl of Lei Cha is to pour some green soup into the bowl of mixed rice/vegetables, mix them up and eat it. But I like to enjoy mine separately :)And if you happen to be around Tanjung Pagar, this is not to be missed. Amoy Street Food Centre which is just a couple of minutes walk from the MRT, proceed to level 2, Lin Da Ma Lei Cha (02-127) serves really delicious and tasty Lei Cha. Usually, any Lei Cha stalls will never see a queue but I was surprised that I had to queue for about 15 minutes for my Lei Cha today.Personally, I feel that this stall have done a great job in preparing this dish. Firstly, they provided options for white or brown rice. Second, they were generous with the serving of vegetables. Third, the taste of each vegetables topped on the rice tasted just right and balanced - not too bland and not too salty. Fourth, this is my favourite part; the green soup is awesome! Two thumbs up!
3
It's better to try and avoid the peak rush between 12pm and 2pm if you can. Outside of those hours this place is more acceptable and there are plenty of interesting stalls to try. During lunch it's often very difficult to get a seat. It's worth making the effort to go upstairs: just don't be put off by the crowds. Overall a worthwhile experience
4
Amoy Food Court is one of the better hawker centres in Singapore; and cheap too. Wide variety of food stalls can be found here but my favourite of them all is the Nasi Lemak on Level 2. Heavenly!!!
4
Great alternative! Serves fresh salad and sandwiches starting 10 am. The dressing is homemade n has a unique blend.love the Thai lemongrass chili dressing! Their toppings are a good mix of Asian and western. So enjoy the salad bowl n healthy eating. Bon appetite :)
4
Charming and friendly place. After browsing the place I ended up with a dim sum-soup which was very good.
4
Tried this new place..Bake_of @#02-111 Amoy food centre. Great breakfast options. Love their all day breakfast specials. U could also request for customised options..bonus try their bakes as well..bon appetite
5
We have visited this food centre a few times now.The food has been fantastic on all occasions.The food / drinks are super cheap.Can get busy, so use your little tissue packs to "reserve" a seat. Then go off an buy your food.The shops with big lines are the ones to visit first. The locals know where the to go for good value too.Very easy walk from China town (and the station)
5
We went for lunch and was lucky to get a table, as the crowds of local and expat office workers descended quickly. The choice of stalls is very good and everything we had from a variety of stalls was good. Best vegetarian laksa I ever had at S$4!!
5
The food centre offers a lot of food variety, instead of the usual Singaporean food. My favorite so far are Hakka food (on the second floor) and Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine (on the first floor).The prices there are reasonable, and compare to other food along Amoy St, it's REALLY cheap. Even though it's packed during lunch time, you can always find a seat as the food centre is really big. Tip: try to go to the second floor, or come slightly later (around 1.30), for less crowd 
4
my office is right between maxwell and amoy...it isnt even a comparison in terms of the food in my opinion. there are too many stalls to comment on, my personal favorites are fish soup and some of the indonesian places. if youre visiting then use the general guideline of if there is a long lineup its probably good. all the locals eat here for a reason, very inexpensive (5$ gets you anything, many times even less than 5 is enough) and authentic food. and a huge selection as well. only downside is not many stalls are open after lunch time.i probably eat here 3 out of 5 lunches a week, never getting bored of it
4
I highly recommend this stall at Amoy street,#02-87. The stall looks kinda Unique,standing out from the rest. Outta curiousity,i decided to give it a try. Wow,i will say dat surprisingly,its newly opened but of high quality and value. Took some pics and jus wanna share it with people working around e area too.
4
Do check out the awesome new salad store open @ 01-60 . Their wraps and sandwich are a good alternative to the routine menu . A great destination for health seakers :)the service is good and timely ( better than the sister stall by the same name a few shops away..where the service is nothing to boast of! ) the veg wrap is the best for health conscious diners.. bon appetite
