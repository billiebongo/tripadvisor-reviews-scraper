Sausage, Sausage, Sausage. Austrian beer. Simple but authentic. Nothing else needed. Great for a quick visit.

If you don't mind the hawker kind of feel, sausages and germanic beer then it is worth a visit. The food was tasty enough, the beer was ok and the service was pretty fast.

I regularly do a business networking event at Erich's, the ErFreiMo.
Simple German sausages, meat loaf and sauerkraut. With German and Austrian beer.
Simply good.
Four thumbs up!

What to say about Erich's Wuerstelstand, The Last Sausage Kiosk before the Equator?
If you have not eaten here, you know nothing about Singapore.
Have a German sausage here and become friends.
Great experience!

If you want food a little different then the usual this is a good place. It's close to the Visitors Center in Chinatown. His baked goods are also very fresh and quite good.

This food was a great change from the others in the area. As expected of a foriegn food, its a little pricy but delicious. Erich is an nice guy and we are glad we could meet him

I stumbled upon this little gem unexpectedly and ended up having a delicious breakfast. It's not cheap, but definitely worth it for the tasty food and experience. The staff were really friendly and helpful too. The breakfast was S$10 for three delicious mini sausages, great scrambled egg, lovely warm bread and a muffin. I would definitely recommend the breakfast and will be back again to try the different kinds of sausages and breads

Service was pretty fast and it was not like other mess hawker center.The sausages we had were pretty nice and it was not that salty and I really liked there onion bread. Simply good :) but the owner should be more welcoming as he looks angr

You can get it all at Erich's in Chinatown. Absolutely loved the food, excellent Austrian food, we had the meatloaf and a Austrian beer, the combo was spot on. Even loved the mustard Erich is using so bought two jars. This place is fabulous, will certainly be going back when we return to Singapore

very different to most of the other food stalls, Erich serves rather special food in China Town:Austrian sausages and bretzels.The food is great, prices reasonable and if you want a change from the normal Chicken Rice, this is the place to go to.Attention: He moved to the Foodcentre down the road. About 200 m further down the road from where he was previously. Ask the lady selling perfume now at his previous location and she will be able to point you into the right direction
