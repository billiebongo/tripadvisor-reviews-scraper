Review by DrSim001. Good Food. A Bit Expensive. Good Ambience. Air-Conditioned. Higher End Chinese Restaurant with decent cutlery. Service is acceptable. A bit far off for tourist. Try the Soya Chicken with Rose... and other signature dishes. Regards DrSim001.

The food is quite good. Wanted to order the roasted duck but already finished. I then ordered lotus root soup, fried egg plant with pork floss, deep fried cod fish and fried tofu. Total about $80

Quaint restaurant serving Cantonese food which was rather good and inexpensive in this neighborhood mall HillV2. Parking though was not very easy to find as there were no signs to direct especially when it's next to a circus. Overall good food in casual settings.

Nice decor, service decent, our first time visit for a group of 5 adults and 1 child. Ordered the stuffed Lotus root about 4 pieces that cost about S$9 - nice very vegetarian like. Ordered 2 soups - coconut chicken soup - no interesting -taste like diluted coconut juice and no taste but it was piping hot. Another soup is the pumping and fig with pork ribs - interesting like a less thick pumpkin soup but it was piping hot, can serve about 6 bowls and overall fragrance and taste were good and refreshing. Can try. Other dishes include Luffa gourd @$17, cereal beancurd @$18,, soft shell crab with salted egg yolk, egg plant @$18, their signature vermicelli @$18, Ee-fu noodles. All dishes are rather bland which are okay with us but i must add that the dishes come hot and has wok-hei so it is acceptable. Another worth mentioning is the Crispy Pork which is crackling yet soft. Prices are on the fine dining side, so based on the small portion it is considered a bit expensive. The Loahanguo drink is also expensive for $18 per flask which is about 5 glasses equivalent. Overall okay, but we would visit again for other dishes to give them as well as ourselves another chance

Had many of their signature dishes for business lunch. Especially love their Signature Traditional Rice Vermicelli with Poached Egg White which is rare to find gourmet ones. Also tried their Signature Cantonese Roast Pork Meat, Fish Maw & Prawns with Glass Noodles in Homemade XO Sauce and their Signature Traditional Hakka Salt Poached Chicken. All are a must-try! Modern wooden seats and great ambience too

we were looking for lunch places around HillV2, and were ushered into the place at around 240pm. we promptly ordered, and the food came rather quickly. quality was decent as it should be, staff were polite. unfortunately, we felt rather rushed the entire time, with a few waitstaff standing half a metre from us, and immediately clearing our plates once cleared, even asking if they could combine certain dishes mid-course so that they could clear some plates off the table, and also asking if we could settle the bill as they were trying to break before dinner time. we understood that we came late, and tried to quickly wolf down our meal as well, but wished we were not rushed that quickly haha, we finished our lunch within 15mins? still one of the few better dim sum places here in the area

Good food, sufficient variety of dishes for selection, attentive and unintrusive service. Remarkable.At 4th level via Isetan's shop floor featuring pots/pan and culinary utensils, Joyden is comfortably cozy. The lady superivosr who adopted our table is marvelous. An absolute gem!Order promptly taken after being painstakingly guided through the menu. Food served reasonably timely. Taste goooood. Well presented.Scored my support for return visits. Undoubtedly

First visit to the restaurant a few days ago. Not particularly accessible, and if you're not from the hood, it's probably not surprising that you don't know about it.Good and interesting selection of dishes, that are different from run-of-the mill Cantonese restaurants. Suprisingly intricately prepared dishes, especially the beancurd and cabbage dish and the mandarin-peel pork ribs that was just fall off the bone.Favourite for the night was actually their signature bee hoon. Do note though that they do it the old-school style with a raw egg that sits gloriously on the top of the noodles and is then beaten into the hot noodles at the table, just like how the traditional Hua-Dan hor fun is done. Silky, comforting, with good wok-hei.If you're not good with raw eggs or pregnant, just let the staff know and they probably can leave it out. IMO, might not taste as good though

My family and friends dined at this restaurant on 26 Dec 16 for dinner. And subsequently, my young daughter, toddler son and three adult friends suffered diahorrea, fever and vomiting over the next few days. My daughter bore the brunt of it as her condition turned out to be salmonella and she was hospitalised for no less than 4 nights over the new year, requiring the drip. Her condition was especially serious and thankfully we went to the hospital sooner if not things could have gotten much worse.I do not think this is mere coincidence given that we all dined together and suffered the symptoms at the same time. Highly suspect that the cause is either the raw egg in the crab meat bee hoon or the soya sauce chicken was not prepared properly. My daughter mainly ate these two items, and dairy and poultry are seen as the most likely causes of salmonella. I have already raised a report with NEA and investigations are ongoing. My wife also contacted the restaurant but there was no formal apology offered, their management does not want to take responsibility and said they would get back to her but we have not heard back. They did try to offer us a free return dinner but why the heck would i want to subject myself to greater risks??!! Thankfully my daughter's medical bills are covered by insurance if not I may be forced to seek compensation.Again this was a terrible, terrible experience and I am writing to highlight the risks of eating at this place and the almost zero customer recovery from the management. This restaurant is part of a chain with a good reputation to uphold, so I am sorely disappointed with how they dealt with this very serious issue. They can contact my wife again if they are serious about making up for this.Extremely miffed

Being a Cantonese, I'm particularly picky of the taste of Dim Sum. We tried their Dim Sum on new year eve and we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered 10 difference kinds of Dim Sum and 9 of them were great. Only pork rib with black bean not to my liking. Reasonably price and good services by their staff.
