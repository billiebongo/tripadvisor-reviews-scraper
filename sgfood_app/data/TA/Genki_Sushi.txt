Went to bugis+ send found this interesting restuarant. Genki sushi! Limited selection but the presentation is interesting! Kids will love it! Food ordered thru' ipad and delivered with fast train via train track! Fun! Will be back!

Good but not the goodnes...the original genki in Shibuya is the top.anyway the sushi is quite good and alway fun order dishes from the tablet.
4
Loved it! And kids even more-- great/ fun concept, supported by great/fresh food at reasonable rates!

Went to genki sushi at orchard central today at about 7pm. There was quite a long queue but it moved quite fast and we got a seat in about 15min. The menu was the new one , but the variety was not as wide as previously when we visited about 3 months ago. The quality also dropped for some of the items was obviously prepared hastily without much effort put in. The novel factor of the toy train was there, but for repeated customers the quality of food is the main factor and it was quite disappointing today

When I first saw Genki Sushi at Takashimaya Singapore, I was extremely thrilled and excited. I was hopeful and expecting to experience the seafood tasting I had in Hong Kong. (I'm NOT comparing with the outlet in Tokyo). I have ordered almost everything, the sushi, sashimi, the tempura and the soup. Sadly, I was wrong; this is NOT the original Genki Sushi. Nothing stands up, the portion, the freshness, the making of sushi, most of the sashimi are in fact tasteless. No different from street food, except the price.So, my short-term appraisal is, skip it for now.Their problems:1. The serving size is small.2. Frozen sashimi without freshness.3. The taste is not there yet, e.g. Grilled Eel, Red Shimp. 4. Looking at the sushi, I'm not sure about their sushi chef skills.5. It's certainly overpriced!If you're a tourist, skip this outlet. If you're local, go somewhere else. In term of price tag and freshness level, Sushi Tei or Ichiban Sushi is ten times better.Their staff's responses,Q1, Your dishes are very different from Genki in Hong Kong. (I didn't mention Japan.)"We are the same as any other Genki outlet." I guess most of their staffs have never tasted the original Genki Sushi.Q2. Is this the right taste, size, seems different from Hong Kong, and the prices... "We are in Singapore, not in Hong Kong... "Well, I think Hong Kong faces greater challenging, competitive market and higher rent compare to Singapore

I've always loved the idea of a bullet train bringing my food to me. It's such a fun restaurant concept, especially for kids, but surprisingly the place had mostly young adults as patrons. By the time I got there at dinner time, there was a long line out the door! Waiting time was roughly 20 minutes. Bf and I took the seats at the bar counter which is obviously space limited. I wish the waitresses would clear the plates more often as my area soon got overloaded with plates and bowls. Food was ok for the price. Ebi tempura could've done with better dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was too bland for my liking. Everything else was just nice. DO NOT get the spicy tuny gunkan...it was like overspiced tuna mush. All I tasted was the chilli powder and nothing else
4
The food here was pretty good and the kids enjoyed it thoroughly... from the tempura prawn udon to the oyakodon ! My wife loved her chirashi salad, although my unadon tasted a bit average.But what really made the trip here fun was the innovative conveyor belt which reminded us of the bullet trains in ! We were waiting in anticipation for the “train” carrying our food to arrive, unload the food and then send it back
4
Went with kids to entertain them and try to guide them into sushi in a funny way. The system is straight forward, you que, get a seat for 1hr, order via tablet and food arrives on those funny little shinkansen trains. Smart, pragmatic. Kids loved it
5
Great place especially with kids. You order by tablet choose your sushi, soup or drink. And shortly a train arrive with your ordered food on it. The sushi are delicious. The variety is very big. If you have eaten enough you can order the bill with the tablet, pay it and check out! Great and definitively a lot of fun
4
Food items were served using the conveyor belt but on choo choo trains which I thought was really fun and innovative.Dishes I would recommend are: Mentaiko salmon sushi, Chawanmushi (steamed egg), Octopus wasabi sushi, Chicken wings & Salmon Unagi Sushi. Oh, and their green tea was really good. Thumbs up! Will return again next time
4
We queued for about 30-45 minutes as we are in groups of six. But the food did not disappoint us, it was good! Definitely will be back!
5
Overall good experience and enjoyed ourselves at Orchard Central Genki Sushi.
Fresh and fast sushi on the train.
4
Very cool choo-choo train sushi with a twist. It is not a choo-choo train, but a bullet train. They also have the names of various Japanese train stations. My nieces and aunt brought me to this restaurant to enjoy dinner. We ordered via iPad. I was amazed by how the trains delivered our orders from the kitchen.I loved the veggie tempura. The sweet scallops were very tasty. My aunt enjoyed the chawanmushi or steamed egg with seafood. My niece enjoyed her fusion sushi: duck breast nigiri and fried chicken nigiri. Interestingly delicious! How about those crunchy deep fried squid or calamari tentacles. We also had a creamy ebiko mayo nigiri.It was a fun evening for all
4
Having eaten at their Hong Kong locations, we expected sushi on a conveyor belt, but here they have three stories of train tracks and you order your sushi via Ipad. The food arrives on a replica shinkansen train right at your table, You unload it and send the train back. Very fun concept. The menu is varied and it is affordable. Most items range between SGD 2-3. It is a good deal
5
Went at about 5pm, and it was not crowded at all. Sushi and condiments were all very good, fresh, clean and well presented. We liked the service your self kind of a concept, the waitress only seats you and you take everything else right from the table. They have faucets with hot water in every table so you can refill your own tea. But the best part is that you order on a very easy to use tablet menu, there is a menu on the wall right by the table and on the tablet every item has a picture. And then your order comes on a train to your table! The kids had a blast with that!Pricing is very decent
1
This is a sequence of our visit:1) Stale food smell permeating even to the walkway outside where we queued - that should be a warning sign that the restaurant was either having ventilation problems or the sushi was not very fresh. Or both.2) the place was spartan, with pipes on the ceiling exposed, lighting harsh, furnishings low quality and not meant to last long. It looked like they were prepared to up and go anytime.3) very noisy. Due to the structure of the restaurant and its bare furnishings with nothing to absorb the sound, it was actually worse than in a market. So for those who prefer a normal meal and not eating in a game parlour, take note.4) bad quality food. We don't expect quality sushi but there should be some understandable standard. It's not even a matter of freshness anymore because the food was just unpalatable. Sushi was stale and flat. Fried items too oily and the oil seemed to have been used too many times. 5) Plates came out greasy and I doubt it was washed. Cross-contamination is not in their dictionary.6) Drum roll as this takes the cake - the udon had the taste of pesticide/hormonal drugs! Took one mouth and no way one can ingest that!7) Brought it up to the manager. She was expressionless and went into the kitchen to ask the staff. Came out still expressionless and asked if I wanted a replacement bowl! No explanations to the odd taste, no apologies.8) Asked her to remove unconsumed udon from bill. She went to the cashier presumably to instruct the girl. We got our stuffs and head to the cashier. Only to find the item still in the bill. Had to spend another ten minutes just to explain to the cashier, get someone's approval and finally a correct bill.9) Never again.10) Think of the pesticide taste in the udon... Never again

Visited Genki Sushi Orchard Central with my SO for dinner. We arrived at 7 pm and it was already starting to get crowded. The staff tending the wait line led us to our counter seats after only a short wait. Once we were seated, we ordered all our food through the IPad that is assigned to our seats. The food came rather quickly thanks to the unique food delivery system that is unlike any conventional sushi belt. Food is delivered to your table only when ordered instead of making rounds waiting to be picked up. This also eliminates the need for a lot of floor staff to take orders. For the price point, the food quality is unbeatable. The bill came up to 50 dollars for the two of us and we were filled. As the mall layout can be confusing for those trying to find this place, it is advised to take the lifts to get to this restaurant

Genki sushi is a place I always return to for no-frills sushi. Just let the staff seat you, take up their ipad menu and get ready for some serious ordering. Staff are polite and thats all I actually require of their service. Clearing of used sushi plates is fast (to me anyway) so I dun usually have to raise my hand for anything, and plain / ice water is self service, which is perfectly alright to me.Things to order (which I like) is..the chawanmushi (BEWARE: Can be VERY HOT to hold so please blow on it before eating lest you want to burn your throat. But i prefer it hot to being served those lukewarm or just, sadly warm types which can feel sad), the various handrolls, (Salmon skin handroll gives a GREAT crunch) and the various aburi types of sushi..(When the mayo and mentaiko mayo get that smoky burned glaze on top it really brings a whole new fragrance to the entire sushi)..Their new item on the menu, the crab and crab tomalley (kani miso) sushi..(Not really for those into 'pretty' sushi, as the gray colored tomalley might put some folks off and the smell can be a little on the overpowering side..wait till its in your mouth...BUT i think it smacks you in the face with the sea, crabby flavour...Their kake udon is not too bad, but at times the soup has been a little on the salty side.On the whole, a great place to go anytime! (On weekends, please go early or you may have to queue all away across to the other side..

Genki Sushi is a very entertaining restaurant because of the way you order and serve. You order on a iPad and wait for it to be served by a electronic train model. Service was very fast (compliments to the chef) and the food was perfectly seasoned
5
Saying goes When in Rome, do as the Romans do! In Singapore that would be to find the longest queue in front of any any eating joint and go join it. The longer the queue the better. This is exactly how I ended up at Genki Sushi on Orchard Road. This place serves excellent Sushi and Sashimi in the most interesting manner. Once you enter, the wait staff seats you at a station. You place your order on an iPad by clicking on the dish, which drops down into the train compartment. Once you place your order, your order is served at your station via little trains that keep zipping back and forth between the tables and kitchen. Once you are done, you click settle on the iPad and then go pay at the cash counter. The Sushi and Sashimi are very fresh, and very tasty. The quality of produce used is top notch. Made multiple trips to the restaurant during my stay and thoroughly enjoyed the excellent food
5
Dial up your food on a computer screen? Fill your cup with hot water right at your table? Calculate your bill as you go? Food arriving on a train? All this and more at Genki Sushi. Super experience.
4
Whats bot to love? You order your selection on an iPad and then it arrives on a racing car or bullet train. Food very fresh and lots of fun.
2
Sushi came with some badly done sushi with zero effort. Maybe the chef wasn't having a good day today... They kept giving sushi that we didn't order too.
5
Great sushi. Good rice. Fresh sashimi. Awesome quick service by the choo choo train. So cute. So fun.
4
Very good sushi but delivered to where you are seating - either counter or booth - with a twist - instead of the usual conveyer belt of moving dishes that you choose from. Here up to four people sit together at a "station" along the counter. The waitstaff hand you an Ipad and you do all your ordering from that.There is a menu posted in tiny letter on the wall where you are seated but the Ipad is pretty self-sufficient. It is cute that as you click on an item it "drops" down into one of four train compartments - the maximum each train delivery can hold at one time. A few minutes later your order pulls into your station and you take off the dishes that you ordered - careful not to try to do this when these zippy little trains are moving back and forth!Only awkward thing about this delivery style is there is no way to take away dirty or empty plates - you have to signal a server. You do this by flagging him/her down or push a button on the Ipad.Wide variety of sushi and sashimi dishes - very good quality. And it would be especially fun for a family to order together if you have kids...
5
Genki Sushi was fantastic. Super fresh food served in a very funky way. Order your sushi on the iPad and it arrives via train (or car), take your plate off and send the train back to the kitchen. Excellent way to serve sushi, would highly recommend

I used to like Genki very much when I was a child and it seemingly disappeared from the food scene for many years. Imagine my joy when I found various outlets opened in town. I have tried the Orchard, Chinatown and Bugis branches. For this review, I had my lunch at the Bugis branch.The food is served on an automated train. I can never get tired looking at the food getting served. When it first started, they even had a slot to insert the used plates, which they stopped. Guess too many people threw rubbish down instead of the plates, which is a pity as they actually had a lucky draw for complimentary sushi once every few plates.Food quality, however, is far from satisfactory. Despite the train which is supposed to send the food immediately from the kitchen, the food is usually and strangely served cold. Good place to bring group of friends to for a one-off experience
4
Genki sushi has always been a favorite of my friends and I. It has good quality sushi that is priced extremely reasonably. In addition the fact that the sushi is fresh instead of going around a conveyor belt for ages is a plus. This is a great restaurant to bring kids to as they're sure to be amused by the planes and trains in which the food arrives on
4
Came in here after gym at 9pm and the place was filled . However service was prompt and i was seated immediately at the bar counter. Sushi variety was good. Salad was limited. The chawamushi was lovely.sushi and raw fish were fresh. Youngsters form the bulk of its clientele. The food was served by a moving " train" . Very cute
4
Orchard central staff are great and the train system for ordering and delivery is a favorite with the family and friends. Good value and great fresh sushi, sashimi at an amazing price. Lunchtime/ Dinner can see a long queue so pick your time carefully. The booths are ok for 4 people - any more and expect to sit on the long benches across the walls. A great experience for anyone wanting quick, no fuss, no frills Japanese at a great price.
4
We were at the Orchard Central outlet. We love the rice with sashimi. Cool to see food delivered by toy train. Reasonably priced.
5
Awesome place. You can get your food with the train. Really cool concept! We love coming here. Sometimes there's a queue but it's really worth it!
3
My first visit with the children. Nice place with friendly staffs. Food is nice, interesting concept.
Recommended!
5
The food is great and nicely presented. Great concept on ordering food as well as the way it is delivered by speed bullet train like in front of you...
4
Raw fish are fresh but ikura not so fresh. Food come out quite fast even though it's weekend lunch time. Ice water is free. Udon portion is small.
I'm not going to come back cos not so special for me :)
4
Simple and straight forward way of ordering your meal. Apart from receiving good and tasteful Sushi the Experience of getting it served by a small train makes it even greater!
3
Came here for lunch this week to the outlet in Bugis+. It wasn't very busy and we were able to get a table without any difficulty. The sushi was quite good for the price charged and the service efficient (direct sushi trains to your table). Probably worth another visit
5
I came here with a friend for lunch after a visit to Library@Orchard. The prices are really decent considering how unbelievably pricy sushi can be in Singapore. The staff are friendly and helpful, but above all, the best thing about this place is the concept of the train. It's cute, exciting and allows you to order as much as you want easily and efficiently. Never been to a restaurant like this one before! I'd come again
4
The train concept of delivering sushi is not only creative and attracts customers but also saves on their manpower shortage. Good idea which will attract customers to come back for more. Food is great too. Their Chinatown branch also have a self plate clearance machine at each tabl
4
'The food is fresh, cheap and served quickly via a unique fast train system linked to ipad orders.Get there early as the queues can be long come lunch or dinner rush hour. Not sure why the new premises has such bright white lights - sort of destroys the ambience but overall a great place to eat and run
3
Food was very ordinary. Green teas was in powder form which just does not taste the same.
Queue was relatively fast moving. Price came up to about $45 for two people.
5
One of my favourite Sushi Places in Singapore. Definitely worth a visit and the queing. If you want to avoid waiting, make sure to not come during the peak hours :)
4
Lunch here with friends. Ordering is via iPad and delivery is by bullet train. Food is fresh and portion is just right.
There is plenty of variety. Green tea powder is on your table. So, you can take whatever and whenever you like.
Nice experience.
4
although the portion of the food served was "below average" and limited menu, i will still recommend it to people around and i will definitely come back again.
like their poached eggs tempura !!
4
Love the concept of the train delivering your food! pretty fun having in zoom with your plates of sushi :) Food tastes pretty ok and pricing is decent. A surprising dish which tasted good was the poached eggs tempura!
4
We were super excited to find this iconic Japanese restaurant in Singapore. You order what you want on an iPad, and then like magic a train or space shuttle zooms from out the back with you order. Good clean fun!
5
They serve the best spicy salmon handroll and sushi!!! And chawanmushi!!
There'll always be queue!! But it's worth the wait!
4
Reasonably priced sushi ordered on a tablet and served on a Shinkansen-inspired tray which rolls in front of you. The tasty Salmon Sushi with Pollock roe is what I usually crave for. I noticed that the servings are slightly smaller at the Orchard Central branch compared to the Chinatown branch. And it's more fun to see 4 layers of the Shinkansen track in Chinatown going back and forth with orders
3
Genki Sushi was quite OK for a quick lunch. I like the way you ordered and the bullet train that delivers your Sushi. The Fatty Tuna was the best but more care needs to be taken on how the Sushi is presented - quite messy I thought
4
Some people feel they need a beer, but most often than not, I find myself hankering for some Genki Sushi. I certainly do love my fair share of Japanese, and there is nothing like a quick, easy, and satisfying meal like Sushiâ€”especially when it comes from a bullet train...Love the food, how its pretty much self-serve, and randomly, their rootbeer float. I can't fault this place even if I tried
5
Excellent fun- food delivered by express train. Ordering is through an iPad. Good quality sushi, great tempura and fries. We would definitely recommend this location.
4
Our first time eat Genki Sushi with iPad order, and auto-delivered by the "train" to our table.. It's a new experience for us.. The kids love it!..
Genki's quality of foods are always very good, and place is clean and nice.
5
It's really nice to be able to take your time to order and to be able to order more sushi without waiting for the wait staff, as a tablet is used to order. The food is delivered on trays on wheels, which is kinda fun. And most importantly the food is good, so I'd recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner
5
To be honest this must have been one of the best kaiten sushi experiences I've had in my life, outside of Japan. We arrived at Genki Sushi sometime before six, so we managed to dodge the queue, but it wasn't hard to understand why a short while thereafter we saw a huge queue of people waiting to be seated.Every table has a tablet which provides an overview of all the different dishes. The interface of the tablet is very intuitive. You just click on the dish you want to order and minutes later a special sushi train brings your order to your table. This form of kaiten sushi guarantees your sushi is super fresh.The sushi selection at Genki sushi is huge, so it was hard to choose from. But everything we had, was excellent. A real treat
5
Service is good, Sushi will be delivered very quickly through the express train and everything else will be brought to you by friendly staff. Prices are very fair and the quality of sushi is perfect. The only negative is that it can be quite noisy and its a bit cold in there. So I recommend to bring a thin sweather. During dinner "rush hour" it can become quite busy with a waiting time. You can avoid that if you arrive early between 5-6.30pm
5
We stumbled on this place by pure luck and seeing the long line of locals waiting decided it would be a good idea to try. You get good fresh made sushi at reasonable prices in a funky and fun way. It was our last night in Singapore, had we known about this place we would have definitely gone back to try more
5
Went for dinner with my friends on a weekend and there was a freaking long queue. Initially, I was hesitant to queue for just food but to my surprise, the sushi is exceptionally awesome! And the price is reasonable! Great service, not that fantastic ambience but food is good. Thumbs up!
5
I'm a sushi lover, and everywhere I go I try to find a sushi restaurant (so i'm a sushi expert). This sushi bar was by far the coolest way to eat sushi!! In addition, the sushi was one of the best I ever had. I would also recommend their gyoza! Bring a sweater though, it felt like we were sitting in a refrigerator
5
Good to make our orders on iPads for speedy service & freshness. Once we place our order, orders comes within 3-4mins directly to our table via the Express system..shaped like a bullet train travelling on a track...guess to reinforce the importance of freshness when serving sushi!? PERFECT!!! Also, since we ordered green tea..came an empty cup instead so we can pour a teaspoon of green tea powder & hot water which readily available on our table...we truly love it!
5
We had a great time celebrating my mother's birthday at Genki! Ordering our food on iPad was quick and easy and it was fun to watch our food delivered by Tokyo Express and Astro Boy!Sushi is affordable with many varieties. They even offer premiums like Fattest Tuna and Sea Eel. Their Chawamushi with Crab is a must try! One of the best Chawamushi I even had! I also like their concept of Sushi Done 3-ways on a plate for those who couldn't decide what they want. The rice for their sushi is also well-seasoned and delicious!Spent $140plus for 4 adults. Great value
4
Novelty fun for kids and family
1. Just order through the ipad equipment
2. Food arrives in either airplane/sports car/train set (swoosh)
3. Collect the food and press button to clear tray (swoosh again)
4. Enjoy the food!
4
Literally! You order what you want on an iPad and your orders were sent to you on a mini bullet train! It's a fun and exciting way to curb my sushi craving!Price-wise very affordable but they also threw in premium like Fatty Tuna, Sea Eel and my all time favorite burst-in-your-mouth Salmon Roe! Can't decide what to eat? Go for their 3-in-1 plates! That's sushi done 3 ways on a plate. I only hope there is more variety but then again, how many sushi can one eat? This place is especially popular with family, especially family with children because of the bullet train. Not the ideal place for your romantic dinner but great for your family or friends get-together!Tip: Come early if you don't want to end up queuing. There's always a long queue
4
Food and service is good but you need to go early as it gets very busy. Our kids love the train that comes to your seat and we love the iPad ordering system. It is not the best sushi I have had but it is quite passable. Also good that the kids can get some basic things and other family members can get Japanese bowls as an alternative
5
We stumbled upon this cute little place by accident, and so happy that we did! The food was very good (even rated highly by my sushi connoisseur husband) but even better, we were entertained by the fact that you order via a little tablet (very easy, and highly entertaining) and your order comes to your booth on a little train on a track. It is fast and fun, and I spent as much time photographing and taking videos of the trains as I did eating. You can't beat Genki Sushi for great prices, and entertainment. It was filled with young Asian people who likely know the great value here
1
Terrible experience at Genki Chinapoint branch, total service failure though they vividly denied it when I posted comments on their FB page, all they did was give excuses on why it cannot be done. what do they blame? System faults of course. Firstly, they gave me a seat right inside the restaurant at the kitchen entrance, I could hear the kitchen staff all through my meal. secondly, about 40% of the items are not available. thirdly when "won" a discount on their system, it was not acknowledged at check-out and that was after a 10mins wait at the cashier before someone appeared to settle my bill, despite having pressed billing call and my table number was flashing all over the tv. I was then ORDERED to go and get my ordering ipad before I was allowed to pay. A request I refused but was told off by the cashier when she went to get the ipad to prove that I am entitled to that 10% discount. Totally spoilt my evening. This place is not worth a visit. Please avoid at all cost
4
whenever we come to Singapore for a holiday which is once or twice every year, we always come here to dine as it is our favourite sushi restaurant. The sushi is put together very well and takes a short period of time to arrive. the only thing that bothers me is that it is a bit over priced even though the sushi is very good, but we love it all the same and can't stop from coming back
3
Had lunch at Genki Sushi on Sunday. It was a rather small place and it did take us a while to get our table.This place take conveyor belt sushi to a whole new level! Instead of food going around on the conveyor belt, a tray, in the shape of a race car, delivers food to your table. It's a cool gimmick that thrilled my kids to no end! The food was alright. Nothing fantastic here. We ordered the deep fried octopus tentacles which was overcooked. The texture of the octopus was rubbery while the flour was a very dark brown. At best it could have been overcooked in oil that has been used far too many times. Then again it could have been left overs that were re-heated.The menu is rather limited and several items were not even on sale. Our favorite was the deep fried salmon skin which was once again sold-out. The spicy tuna and spicy salmon were drowning in mayo but otherwise had a good amount of chillis to it. We didn't linger around for too long and continued with lunch elsewhere
2
Tried this chain in August and was disappointed with the quality. The delivery concept is interesting with the train arriving directly where you're sitting, but the sushi is poor quality.I prefer the Itacho chain for budget-priced sushi in Singapore.(Comments here relate to the Genki Sushi outlet at Chinatown Point, but it is the same chain
2
This is a bit like a fastfood Sushi house. Lots of technology (which does work quite well) to bring your food to your table very quick. Some of the sashimi is good but the sushi I had was falling apart and looked as if it was thrown together. I'm not bothered about going back
5
It had been a long time since I've been to any sushi restaurant and I was so happy I found Genki Sushi. The servers were polite, there was almost no wait after I ordered my food. And the entire experience was a good one. I loved their electronic menus, so I didn't have to wait for anyone to come and ask me what I wanted. Loved it
5
I like how the restaurant modern style. Equipped with iPads to order your food. Don't miss the California hand roll and the chicken teriyaki don.
4
The sushi is pretty good and the prices are good. My daughter loves iPads that you order on and the belts that shoot out airplanes and race cars to deliver the sushi.
Lots of fun for the family!
5
We love to go to Genki Sushi - OC mall. The sushi are very good.
The staff is very kind and price are really correct.
Our sons love to go there.

While having automated toy trains serve us the food we ordered via iPad was nice, the novelty wore off fast, especially when the food is this terrible. It looks like Genki Sushi did not learn anything about food quality since exiting Singapore some years back. Initially looking forward to a fun dining experience, expectations came crashing down fast the moment I tasted the food. Of course I am aware that this is no high-end establishment, and I don't expect the sashimi to be that fresh. However, the extent to which it was stale shocked me.I made the mistake of ordering chirashi don and as well as other raw fish sushi and sashimi. The salmon sushi, among the first to arrive, tasted stale, but still borderline passable. Then came the chirashi don and maguro sashimi. Half a bite into the maguro sashimi, I could taste that it was completely off and sour. Totally unacceptable. Already regretting ordering this, we called the waitress to tell her nicely. Without saying anything, not even a "sorry", she took the plate with the offending sashimi and walked off. What sign does this give? I suspect this is a regular complaint about their sushi... and they haven't done anything about it. A couple of minutes later, the automated sushi train delivered a new plate of maguro sashimi. This one tasted slightly better but there was still a bit of a sour taste. Not wanting to create an issue, I said no more. Honestly, even the replacement served would win hands down the worst sashimi I have ever eaten in this country. The maguro in the chirashi don was the same amount of "freshness", while the other fish and fish roe were borderline passable. Will be staying clear of this restaurant from now on, and I advise all to do the same. If you absolutely have to eat here, eat the cooked food. The cooked food ordered by our dining group tasted alright, though not anything amazing. Stay far, far away from the raw stuff

Flashy technology. CheckedStale sushi. Checked.Poor customer service for the “crew”. Checked.Exorbitant bill. Checked.And THERE’S MORE! Genki Sushi at Chinatown Point now serves sashimi that comes with BONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the worst Japanese food I have had in living memory. I seldom dine at commercialised sushi conveyor belt restaurants in Singapore because these places are infamous for frozen sashimi and low quality sushi and Japanese food. I decided to give Genki Sushi a try because of many positive reviews from the local food blogosphere like:http://www.misstamchiak.com/genki-sushi/http://danielfooddiary.com/2013/03/21/genkisushi/(No offence to these respected bloggers, I believe that their entries are true to their real-life experiences but unfortunately my personal dining experience begs to differ)It was public holiday for Labour Day, yet my hard-earned dollars were terribly wasted on dinner at this rip-off Japanese sushi restaurant. Were the chefs, waiters/waitresses and managers on a quality strike just because they were not given Labour Day off? Food and Customer ServiceNothing fantastic. In fact nothing good. Do humans actually eat this? And then PAY FOR IT? The swordfish belly was tough and half-frozen. The deep fried soft shell crab was very greasy and oily. Similarly, the cream croquette was greasy and revolting, which resembled something I got out from those frozen packs of party food at the supermarket.The very first salmon sushi my friend bit into, had a 1 &a half-inch-long bone in it.How can anyone, ANYONE, overlook a bone of such considerable length in such a thin slice of fish. I raised my hand to alert a “crew” member (At Genki, there are waiters/waitresses in light brown uniform and a couple of staff in black t-shirts that read “crew” at the back. I’m guessing the “crew” are the managers? Correct me if I’m wrong) and one of the “crew” members did not stop when passing our table but instead waved a (brown-uniformed) waitress over to us.After 5 mins, a Chinese waitress named Li Chen came up to us. We explained the bone issue to her calmly and nicely. But of course. Our beloved foreign talents have no regard for human life or food safety (we should have known better). She was more concerned about the fact that the “crew” staff who waved her over to us should have been responsible for the bone problem, not her. She said she would tell the kitchen but it would be better if we do it ourselves so she wouldn’t be blamed for the bone problem. Also, the “crew” member should be dealing with this, not her, because we alerted him initially.Yes, Genki Sushi, entrust your customer service into the hands of PRC foreign talents, your future ahead is a bright and promising one I guarantee.Nope I am not impressed.The flashy iPad minis that you can order your food and monitor your bill from? Oh please. The first one we used was on 4% battery life. It died on us in the middle of the meal. We alerted the staff, who took it away and nothing came back even after 15 minutes. We requested for another, from a “crew” member who hastily walked away without waiting for me to finish my sentence. Then we got another iPad mini with a 7% battery life. WOW thank you Genki, I am so impressed with the 3% increase, this is an emotional moment for me.REAAAALLLY? I saw at least 20 iPad charging stations at the entrance and a couple of iPad minis unused and sitting idle in their docks. Excuse me while I roll my eyes. Just when you thought Genki Sushi is the MOST HIGH-TECH SUSHI CONVEYOR BELT EVVVVVERRRRR, the least they could do was have technology that ACTUALLY WORKS. We stopped ordering because we realised the bill has totalled up to S$54+ when we were only a third full from the meal. Even when we got up from the table to pay at the cashier, the nightmare was not quite over.At the till, a “crew” member called Joanna served us. At least she was Singaporean. But alas, while we paid for our meal, I politely asked if they had a customer feedback system I could use. She was hesitant and said that the office was not fully set up, there was no feedback forum/ email/ whatsoever. Reaaally? Two branches opened in Singapore and still no management office for Genki Sushi? Dodgy illegal sushi, I say.Shame on you, Genki Sushi. This is the era when companies are scrambling to have a presence on the Internet and social media platforms- they are DYING to connect and communicate to their customers. Did you die before you even tried? At the end of the meal, instead of ending the meal feeling satisfied and happy, we were full from a sick feeling of disgust and discontentment inside of us. Pretty difficult to find the right words to describe, but it was like my mind and stomach was reeling from the injustice done to my body.And the only thing fresh at Genki Sushi? Our hot and sizzling notes and coins straight from our wallets, right into the pockets of Genki Sushi’s bosses. Happy Labour Day guys.Sadly, there’s only so little redeeming quality from those flashy iPad minis and “train” conveyor belts. All those dollars wasted on such boastful and unnecessary touches to the dining experience have been otherwise well spent on IMPROVING safety & quality of their food, customer relationship management and public relations.Singapore is THE destination for any foodie, which well explains the competitive climate of restaurants, cafes and other eateries. I understand it is not easy running a food business, but it is no excuse to compromise on achieving the most basic expectations we Singaporeans have of eating out with our loved ones.By looks of it and the lack of LISTENING to its customers, I’m guessing this is one restaurant that will continue to rest on its laurels in oblivion.Call me a fusspot but I’m definitely not returning, and rest assured my family, friends (both local and overseas visitors) and colleagues will not be stepping in any Genki Sushi even if it was the last sushi restaurant on Earth.Visited Chinatown Point branch on 1st May 2013 for dinner

I went to Genki Sushi China Town Point's outlet few times ever since they opened for business. I would like to say, foods there were really nice, fresh and with very affordable price. The way they served foods to our table was a really good one, with a sport car ! & Food ordering thru an iPad... U should try it if you happen to be at China Town Point Shoping Centre some day

Genki is a great time, food is ordered by iPad where the menu is completely visual and the food is delivered by race cars that come on a track straight from the Kitchen. The food is above average on price but is quite good in terms of quality. For a fun time or if you have out of town guests, highly recommended

Visited with a group of friends and the novelty alone makes this place worth a visit. The menu via the iPad is easy to read a navigate, and the speed of service by toy train is impressive. You can keep track of your bill as you go along and so be paid and gone quickly.Ideal for a quick bite to eat, or to take children

My kids (5 & 3) loved the concept (delivery by train) and as a result ate food without questions that they might have otherwise looked at with suspicion. The staff were very accomodating of the kids. The price was very reasonable c.S$60 for 2 adults and 2 kids for lunch. Also, it has the best priced Asahi almost anywhere in Singapore

Went here with my two teen aged daughters earlier this week and I have to say we were all pretty disappointed with the quality of the food. Loved the concept of a Bullet Train delivering food to your booth after you have placed your order via ipad - however the sushi it'self was less than ordinary. Which seems criminal given the amount of great sushi available in Singapore.
