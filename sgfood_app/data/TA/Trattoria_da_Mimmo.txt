Tucked in a row of shop house inside a private residential estate opposite Bishan Junction 8; the ambience is nice and cosy; the food is tasty; we ordered salad, steak, seafood spaghetti;

Excellent menu, and good wines, all at reasonable prices. House wine is quite good quality vs price. Lasagna and pizzas outstanding, items out of menue often a pleasant surprise. Staff and chef friendly and welcoming.

Recently I was invited to Trattoria and was impressed by the quality of the food. We ordered the bacon salad (bacons are not too fatty or oily), smoked pork chop salad, calamari - these starters were awesome. Followed by we had aglio oglio pasta with scallops, baked salmon as mains - all so tasty. For dessert we had chilled lemon sorbet (stuffed in a huge lemon, specially imported from Italy), it was a refreshing treat to round off a satisfying meal

This restaurant is located in one of the suburbs in Singapore and is run and managed by an experienced team.They do the staple Italian dishes like aglio olio very well but always ask the servers for the specials.Pricing is reasonable and their house merlot, at S$45 a bottle is a steal.We’re definitely coming back again

They serve one of the best pizzas, stock the freshest & amazing Parma ham in Singapore. Umpteenth visit to this amazing slice of Italy. Thank you Chef Mimmo for the amazing fresh food, warm service and delightful menu. P/s they have the nicest range of prosecco & muscato in addition to the great wine list.

Was taken here recently by friends who used to visit the old Al Borgo in Bkit Timah. Now located in suburban Bishan, this is a real gem. Seemed crowded with local residents and the food, while unpretentious is very good. Cold cuts, pizzas, various pastas and main course options and a decently priced wine list. We will be back.

We fell into with Chef Mimmo's authentic Italian cuisine during Al Brogo days, we have finally found Chef Mimmo at this cozy restaurant. We ordered our all-time favourites which we have been missing for last 3 years: grilled meat, fish, pizza & pasta etc, all amazing. Look forward to coming back soon
