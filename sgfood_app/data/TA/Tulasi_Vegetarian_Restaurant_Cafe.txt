Tulasi serve delicious food and got friendly staff. Went for lunch and we enjoyed it. People at any age can visit. Better to reserve seats if you are inviting people there.

If I remember correctly, it says Vegetarian restaurant at the entrance but you can also buy non- veg food. That was OK with me. Food was good.

Great Indian food for a price
The Indian food is authentic
The decor is dated and the place is small
The service is good and the food is served quickly

Went here for the first time with my family. We ordered Hyderabad briyani, chettinad fried rice, chettinad curry Claypot. All of them were very delicious. Quiet ambience. Recommend this place.
Verdict: vegetarian that taste as good as non vegetarian.

There is plenty of variety to choose from their menu, however their food has MSG. Service is good but slow.

We visited here after finding our restaurant of choice to have no seats, and it seemed the best value of all the relatively expensive restaurants on Racecourse Road.Out table was very small with people passing by all the time, though this was not too disturbing. We were immediately brought two bottles of water (charged for) which seemed unnecessary as the tap water is perfectly drinkable, and a dish of nibbles.As it was late, we only ordered 2 dishes and 2 naans, which were perfectly acceptable, but the overall experience was not really different from eating in an indoor food centre at half the cost.Though it says vegetarian on the sign, there is also a good range of meat dishes, so there is no limitation for dedicated meat eaters

There were 6 of us and we ordered Kampong nasi goreng, masala mushroom, chille tofu, tahu goreng, starters, mee hoon goreng and mui fun. I must say that the food is just average and terribly spicy but what really annoyed us was the hostile manner of the waiter who kept on watching us with an eagle eye coz my friends and I were exchanging Deepavali goodies and gifts - sure was an unpleasant experience given the fact that it was not a cheap meal! Really disappointing in comparison to the warm welcome I received when I first visited this place a few years ago! These people should not be so petty and learning to welcome customers would definitely help their biz grow, for instance a warm smile would go a long way

We dived into this restaurant to escape a tropical downpour. We found ourselves in a small friendly restaurant where Indian friends and family were dining. Contemporary decor, vegetarian fusion food - Indian, Malay, Chinese. All delicious. Service was fine and the meal was good value. We paid $50 for two courses for two people. Close to Little India metro.

I visited this restaurant with my family. The food was delicious but the service was pathetic. One has to wait 15 minutes to get a glass of water. Even the quantity is very less for the cost. One advise for people visiting the restaurant is avoid it on weekends as there will be lot of people and you will end up getting treated badly

Real good food , worth the price...Sure among very few authentic Indian restaurants in singapore.Sad... no home delivery available.Service is good, but can be further improved.Decor is mediocre, surely can be improved..But overall good experience... as taste what all matters... everything else is secondary.And no doubt... it tastes real yummm and authentic..

Rightly spiced and delicious food I have had in Singapore! Everything was perfect, from presentation to taste! Small but an elegant restaurant I should say. I will certainly go back!

This restaurant is located on Race Course Road.
It is a pure vegetarian restaurant.
Those who like mock meat, this restaurant serves a lot of options.
Service is good and efficient.
It would cost SGD 40 for two.
This place is worth a visit.

A south indian restaurant trying to dole out north indian food - terrible food and dont even attempt the dal makhani. Not again

Lots of mock-meat dishes. Lots of biryianis. And a Malay menu as well.
Parking is usually available on-road just outside.
Pure vegetarian.

Completely pure vegetarian serving all types of traditional saags but also plenty of fake-meat dishes. I'm from London and found this hidden gem across on my walk and found the mock-chicken to taste even better than Gokul's. I HIGHLY recommend you try the Chicken 65 starter... it was AMAZING, best starter I have tasted in mock-foods! Great service too from the two brothers that I believe own the restaurant

The moment we landed there, they offered us with their menu and we were astonished to see all items had non vegetarian names with photographs. On inquiry we were informed that all of their dishes with non vegetarian names are actually 'MOCK' dishes made out of Soya and else.The place is small, neat and decent to dine. The staff is highly courteous and efficient. The taste of all that we ordered was extraordinary. Especially the ROTIS were made out of pure flour and not maida. At Singapore when you order a Roti or a parantha generally they serve you with maida. But it was at Tualsi that we were offered pure Flour (atta) made rotis.The taste was highly gratifying. We tried other big names at this place but Tualsi has no comparison. In size Tualsi is merely 15% to big names whereas the taste goes Tualsi is 85% better then the leading names.For strict vegetarians that have highest sensitivity towards beef, pork, fish, egg etc. This is the THE PLACE. And i am writing all bold letters out of my own personal experience. I hope they maintain it the same way in future as well. A must visit for people like me who are generally sensitive with avoidance of non vegetarian food

It isn't hard to see the variability in both the quality of food and to a lesser degree the serviceWe first stumbled upon Tulasi some time ago and have been going there about every three months or soTo be fair the food tends to be better in the early evenings and less so later in the night as is the service which leads me to believe that it's a quality control issueThe quality goes straight out the window when they get busyBut overall the food even on a bad night is above averageFor a change we had lunch there and contrary to previous advice the dhal makhani was really good rich in taste and texture They managed to miss our drinks orders but the food made up for itMy advice to the owners- check the quality - this place is too good to go down the drai

Having decided to host Indian Vegetarian lunch to a friend who lives in Singapore, during our recent 4 day business cum holiday trip, we spotted on this whole walking in the sidewalk of Race Course Road; we have been misled by the name sounding to be a good restaurant; however we haven't realised the fact that several other small joints have been crowded but this restaurant.We have ordered simple vegetarian dishes, the items were below average in taste. St least the simple curd ordered was not tasting alright. Request for a salad that has been served after we have finished he meal.Overall pathetic experience. Don't get mislead by names in Singapore especially when you look for vegetarian meal

I'm known to be a HUGE meat lover and only go vegetarian on 2 days in the whole year-Ash Wednesday & Good Friday :)However, I am already planning my 3rd visit to this place cause the food is so good!Two of us had the char kway teow (fried noodles), palak paneer (cottage cheese in spinach), mutton varuval (mock mutton in spicy thick gravy) and button mushroom in gravy.Of all the items, only the mushroom wasn't so nice but the rest of the dishes were lip-smacking!My cousin re-checked the menu just to make sure that it was all vegetarian. as she couldn't believe it.Total bill including a teh tarik (pulled tea): $48.50 :

We had been to this place with family to enjoy and relish vegetarian food on the special occasion of Diwali festival. When we entered the place there was just one family occupying one table out of 9 tables. We were the 2nd to enter and we're greeted and requested to sit in 4th table. Following us entered few families who occupied table 2 3 and 9. This is when things started to fail. We were not attended to take our orders till reminded for after about 25 minutes and by the time our order could be served in about an hr guests at other tables were either done with eating or already enjoying their meal..not that this place is huge and one can be missed to be attended but for the management of guests...other than this the food was delicious with wide variety of food to choose from and something for everyone in the family ...hope it's better next time if I still decide to visit

A vegetarian restaurant, with mock non veg dishes, tulsi is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Food is very delicious and moderately priced with prompt service. One of the must visit veg Indian restaurants in Singapore!

We've been to Tulasi a few times and the one thing that's stood out every single time is the service - the staff is warm and friendly, they remember you, and make good recommendations. The mock meat is probably one of the reasons a lot many people eat here, but their vegetable only dishes are also pretty good. We've tried multiple things - Mock Meat Biryanis, Chicken Gravies, Mutton Rogan Josh, Thai Spring Rolls, Garlic Naan, Palak Paneer (delectable gravy), the Satay, & the delicious Ras Malai. It's worth eating here, more than a few times - the menu's exhaustive enough that you'd want to

If you are looking for a place to catch up with friends or have a family dinner, you could go to this place, but best not during peak timings like dinner.The place is small and you need to queue especially dinner time, if you did not make any reservations. And if there is a long queue waiting, you don't really get to spend a lot of time with friends. The restaurant is quite quiet. As for the food, its average, nothing spectacular, cost is rather the same as compared to the rest. A plate of vegetable briyani is about $7.90. Malasa tea $3.50

We entered into this restaurant accidentally and had no expectations. It took time for me to understand the menu and order. Malabar dum Briyani with chicken (mock) was good while mutton chukka (mock) didn't taste good for me. Food was nicely presented.Overall, this restaurant gave a different, yet good experience.Staff were very helpful

Went to this restaurant today with great expectation but I was wrong. Ordered hara bhara kabab for 10.9 SGD and got 4 pieces of paneer with couple of tomato slices. Paneer was pathetic with sour taste as if its many days old. When we told same to restaurent guy and he was indifferent, out of 4 we only ate 1 piece just to taste it still he charged full money. Now comes mail course with full of colour in it, my hand was colourful even after washing it multiple times with soap. Total bill was 37.7 SGD for 2 person with mineral water bottle added (2 QTY) which we never took it. However he reduced that money from total bill. On top of bill there was surcharge of 10% , don't know for what it was charged. Total 2 person were there to serve all guests in peak time they were serving as well as cleaning table and waiting time was at least 15 minutes. Never recommend this restaurant to anyone they are not good for anything. Hope this review helps to all persons thinking to go there

I visited this place with family on Sunday afternoon for lunch. The place was not so crowded and we could easily find a table for four of us. The menu is quite extensive with India, Malay, Thai dishes. The menu is all vegetarian and contain mock meat. We tried the chilli mushroom, stuffed aaloo, paratha and vegetable pulav. The quantity for all these dishes was good. The presentation is also good. Papadam with mint chutney & mango chutney are served complimentary. We also tried bandung float cool drink which is mix of rose flavored drink with vanilla ice cream. The food items were nicely cooked. Only the aaloo were bit undercooked but it was manageable. The service was quick with the limited staff that they haveThe plates served for eating were bit odd shaped. I did not feel comfortable eating in a square shaped plate with a bowl like structure. Especially if you have gravy and bread without a side plate its very difficult to eat in this type of plate. Management can think of providing more standard plates for better experience. The food was very reasonably priced. For the quality & quantity that was offered we in fact felt may be it was underpriced. Based on this experience, i would definitely visit this place again in future.

Hungry and don't know where to go? Then you have to check out this place. The ambience is pretty standard, but you won't be coming here to enjoy the ambience. I stayed in Singapore for 5 days and this place had the best food hands down, I'd eaten anywhere. We'd ordered the cookie cutter Indian meal: - Tarka Daal - Bhindi do Pyaaza - Kashmiri dum aloo The Daal was piping hot, the bhindi was so fresh we thought they grew it in the back before serving it to us and the Dum aloo was the second best Kashmiri preparation I'd had in my life. Just thinking a big it brings a smile to my place. If I had to rate the food by itself, taking into account flavor, presentation, freshness and value, I'd give Tulasi 5 stars no questions. But as on overall restaurant experience I would give 4 stars, because in my books, a 5 star restaurant has to have impeccable food and a jaw dropping ambience. But like I said you're coming here to enjoy some classy North Indian food made the way it should be

Hard to find a pure Veg restaurant in Singapore and we stumbled upon this and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty and authentic veg food. The restaurant is also very economical and the servings are also very reasonable. The restaurant is slightly ill staffed and the wait time can be a little frustrating. The main turn off for our family (pure vegetarians) was the mock meat dishes in the menu.

In little India you are just overwhelmed by the choices - this vegetarian only restaurant stood out because of that. The menu lists all sorts of mutton, chicken and fish dishes - but they are all made with substitutes so fine for any veggie. That said we ate very well without any of those options. All had good flavours and were not too hot. The puffed Batura bread was very good - and new to me but the star was a Kulcha nan stuffed with dried fruit, coated with ghee and served towards the end of the meal as a sort of sweet finishing dish. Full marks to the waiter for suggesting we were ordering too much and he was absolutely right. Singapore has so many places to eat I may not get back here but I'd love t
