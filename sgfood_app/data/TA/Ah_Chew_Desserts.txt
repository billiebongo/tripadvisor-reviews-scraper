The desserts there were great and tasty ðŸ˜‹. We ordered yam paste, almond paste and durian sago. I enjoyed the yam paste the most! Enjoyed eating there! Sibei shiok!

Love the desserts here. The taste is so good. The prices are obviously higher than what you can get at hawker centres.

This branch outlet has been there for the past three to four years. Quality still the same, good. Yam sago has chunks of yam cubes.

Tried the mochi, the durian dessert and mango sago. All tasted pretty good. Place can be very full and the queue can be long.

Although sceptical after disappointing desserts in Chinese restaurants, this place proves that Chinese do know how to make great (and mostly healthy) desserts. Try the mango pomelo sago and never doubt that again!

It was my first time visited the place . The dessert was great. The service staff was fantastic and attentively .

I came here many times for chill durian desserts with sago. I have tried their steamed egg milk pudding and others but my favourite is still durian dessert. I prefer this branch than the one at Liang Seah street.

We've just stepped out of Ah Chew's Dessert, somewhat indignant. Our family of 7 wanted something familiar & sweet to end our family dinner so hopped over to Ah Chew's to do so. Like every family , we shared our desserts. We requested for extra spoons & went to the counter to get extra bowls. There's nothing cozier than sharing 7 types of dessert among us. Within 15 mins of eating, when our bowls were almost empty, the server came to want to clear away our bowls. We politely declined as we had some left and our family chit chat was still ongoing. In the space of 10 mins, the server came 3 times to insist on clearing away the bowls, a few still with leftovers. We understood the clear signal that we need to leave. So we got up & left. Family chit chat interrupted. Our advice to those looking for chit chat over desserts, this is NOT the place. BTW, we gave feedback to the man in charge as we left, saying " why do we feel like we are being chased away?" His response was not a " service-recovery type ". Or to apologise that his customers feel like that. Instead he was defensive saying he needed the bowls to be cleared for washing by the " dish-washing aunty" who is leaving soon. It was just 9.30 pm.( I think their closing time is 12 midnight). We told him we wanted to give him the feedback that we felt we were being chased away. He repeated his defense of " if aunty leaves, bowls will be left unwashed ..."!!!!!Is it just us or has Singapore's cafe scene become mercenary? Eat up, pay up & Go! It's not as if there was a queue waiting outside. We looked around and there were a few empty tables. Or perhaps Ah Chew's Dessert felt it was not worth their while to have an order of 7 Desserts and so many bowls to wash!The food taste? Not extraordinary. Prices are $4.50 for Mango with Pomelo and $6.50 for Durian Desserts. Guess we were not of enough commercial value

Came here yesterday for a visit with a friend and tried the mango pomelo sago, with an extra scoop of icecream. All quite tasty and not too busy in the later afternoon on a Saturday. Not much difference from the main outlet at Liang Seah street

I always visit with the family after a nearby meal to fill up on awesome local desserts.Craving for a bit of durian but don't want to shell out a hefty sum for the King of Fruits? Just order a durian sago, a rich puree of durian which comes with a dollop of ice cream. The uninitiated won't get it.The mango sago is equally rich and tasty with chunks of mango to make you feel you've eaten the actual fruit.We also had the mochi with peanut filling, which was soft as mochi should be.Plenty of other choices (more than fifty I figure) of hot and cold desserts to whet your appetite.Only thing is the tight fit as they pack in the rosewood tables and stools which lend the oriental feel of the place but isn't exactly space friendly.Nevertheless, eat and go feeling fully satisfied
