Just had a wonderful meals here! A la carte selections has a range of menu intended for CNY. Truly enjoyable dinner with great favours and creation !! Will be back for sure!!

Helpfully accommodating and cheerful staff.
Each dish was elegantly presented.
Serving staff clearly explained and described each dish when it was served.
Always a pleasurable dining experience at the Summer Palace!
5
Amazing food and service. Prices are a little expensive but the quality of the produce and dishes is of a high standard.

Was looking for a comfortable place for dinner. It was relatively empty - so happy for our big group. Food was good with all the usual Chinese dishes but a little more flavor eg XO sauce ; clay pot etc etc
5
From the moment you walk into dine in this finely manicured restaurant, the staff is attentive, thoughtful, and above all professional. Though the prawns and pork were mouth watering, the star of the show was the cod. I’ve never had a piece of cod that tasted like that. That being said, the mini abalone soup is remarkable in its own right; be warned it is HOT. The selection of wines is small but definitely handpicked and worth exploring. The mango and coconut desert at the end was a perfect finish to a wonderful meal

My wife and I dined at the Summer Palace on the last day of stay at the Regent and were extremely impressed with the delicious meals and attentive service by the waiting staff. We were warmly welcomed and ushered to our table overlooking the swimming pool. We ordered half a Smoked Chicken with Jasmine Tea Leaves, Diced Beef with Asparagus and Black Pepper Sauce and Fried Fish Noodles with Fish Fillet and Enoki Mushrooms. They were absolutely mouth watering, tasty and beautifully presented. Our lovely waitress, Jessica recommended sweetened Red Bean Cream with Glutinous Dumplings and Chilled Cream of Mango with Sago and Pomelo for our desserts. We have only one word for our experience with the Summer Palace, "Amazing "

We had booked this restaurant well in advance prior to leaving the UK, and the reason we’d chosen this eatery was twofold: i) it was in the same hotel as the Manhattan Bar, which we had booked for earlier that evening, and ii) it served local cuisine. That aside, it has also been awarded a Michelin star ...We decided to opt for the Chef’s tasting menu, at $76pp.We were pleased to note that the restaurant was filled with locals, which is always a good sign !Service was friendly and attentive.The ambience was very pleasant, although I did note that we and one other European couple were sat at tables in the far corners of the room, almost as if we shouldn’t be there ... but not that this troubled us in any way.We thought we were on to a real winner with our choice of menu, as the appetiser selections were divine; a mix of three different delectably delicious morsels. After that, however, the meal didn’t continue to live up to our expectations.There was nothing wrong with what we ate, it was probably just because our palates are wired-up differently ! The bird’s nest soup was interesting, although my wife, with knowledge of what goes into it, declined to eat hers. And all the other dishes that followed (scallops, lamb and cod) were fine, but perhaps lacking what satisfies the average European stomach.So all in all, an interesting experience, but just not our cup of tea ... If, however, you wish to experience genuine local cuisine, then there’s every chance you’ll be delighted

Had birthday celebration and the 3 of us loved the dishes eg pumpkin soup / dim sum. My mother-in-law was delighted with the pineapple tart made with olive oil. Service wise the restaurant was flexibile to replace the soup in set meal with pumpkin soup. Most staff were exceptionally good and patient, only 1 smiled for tourists but cold to us. Nevertheless this is a good place for celebratio
5
We had a fantastic experience. We left it to our server to choose the dishes for us and we really enjoyed his selection. He did not try to walk us up to the most expensive. He truly selected the best dishes. All of them were delicious and well presented.
5
My daughter with Celiac rarely gets to eat at Chinese restaurants, not to mention Michelin star Chinese restaurants. Summer Palace is a fantastic restaurant, more importantly they have an entire page of GF options. Need GF in Singapore? This is a great choice. She had Fried Chicken with garlic and plum sauce, but there are 10 choices on the GF menu. Reservations likely required.
5
Loved their current promotion of the double boiled soups. Quiet and calm atmosphere which I totally enjoyed for a quiet lunch
5
Loved the soups, especially the pumpkin seafood soup, ingredients were very fresh and generous. Enjoyed the roast platter too. Must try.
3
Dim sum are not exiting at all and found that very limited varieties. Should have a bit more for traditional dim sum. Overall the main dishes are in right taste and good portion. No wet towel was provided.
5
The food was very nicely done! Nice presentation as well. The portion was reasonable. Tried the chef’s tasting menu! It was really nice... great service!
5
Exquisite dim sum and attentive service. The scallop dumplings, abalone dumplings were very unique. Fried mee sua was yummy. They provided complimentary birthday buns as it was my mother's birthday. Will certainly be back!
4
Celebrated dad’s birthday with the set menu. Excellent food matched with excellent service. Kids friendly at a relaxed environment - will be back!
4
i am allergy to many things when i went... the staff are very nice. i like the tomato they serve for appetizer~
4
I don’t know when was the last renovation but the red carpet and brown furniture look like they are from the 80’s.Service was good but not excellent. For example the food was not announced.The wine menu was limited but there was a Brunello for $168.We had six courses. The food was hearty and delicious. But they were not particularly creative or innovative.We had the Gold Menu: (1) Roast pork, soft shell crab and Peking duck(2) Seafood consommé with prawns and scallops (3) Cod fritters in sweet chilli sauce with mango (4) Chicken with black pepper sauce, mushroom and greens(5) Braised noodles with chicken and greens(6) Jelly with passion fruit seeds, goji berries and mangoI am not certain that it is Michelin class but officially it is one star
5
Firstly the Head Waiter was awesome. She was witty and informative and helped us choose great food. The food is delicious clean and creative with all the right flavours. Wine selection was good and the whole evening was relaxing yet fun and intimate. We loved it!
5
It was a last min decision to try out this 1 Star Michelin Chinese restaurant and we ordered the tasting menu, at $176 per pax. No regrets as we get to try many dishes, the suckling pig was amazing, it had crispy skin with prawn and almond flakes which I have never seen in other restaurants before. The soup was incredible too, every dishes just wow us. We were also served by Alfred who is very helpful and nice. We will be back soon!
4
The prices are reasonable and they offer congee as well although it's not on the menu. Compared to summer pavilion though I felt the food was not as great.
4
Very good dim sum. The dim sum is nice in term of taste and setup. The food was very innovative. Hard to find such good one.
3
The crab fried rice was delicate in flavour and generous with crab meat. However the dimsums were quite dissapointing. Chee Cheong fun was thick, and there's nothing to shout about the abalone siu mai.
Go for the ala carte dishes, skip the dimsum.
5
Awesome service, amazing food. Just try to order Chef's Lui Tasting Lunch menu if you don't know what are you want. But it's min for 2 persons.
5
Brunch menu is excellent with the right portion. Sumptuous food and excellent service. Thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon brunch.
4
The food is fantastic good. Very fresh. The dim sum is exquisite also. The food portion is more than enough. The staff is friendly. Will be a returning customer
5
An absolute delight of a restaurant - a cut above the regular run of the mill chinese hotel restaurants.
4
The décor at Four Seasons or Regent hotels is always understated but elegant; here, it is quite dated, so the dining room looks more comfortable than smart. The dim sum menu is short but has many innovative dishes, like squid ink dumplings. No major creation in the à la carte menu, but even simple dishes like fried rice (we had the 8 treasures variety) and crispy chicken are prepared with refinement. Service is courteous, but not terribly pro-active
5
The food is great. Brunch set menu on weekends are value for money as for $56 per pax, you get 4 dim sum dishes, two starters, soup of the day and 4 main dishes with desserts. Good quality food, not to mention excellent service as well. The only thing I don't like is jellyfish in meat platter, taste weird
5
From start to the end of our lunch, we were delighted with quality of food and the attention of service. It is also the first Chinese restaurant that has a page of gluten free dishes and was told it has separated equipment to cook for this dishes. Very impressive and it showed the commitment to great standard.This is our first time and we will visit more often. It is a place we can call it as well deserved a recognition as Michelin star restaurant
5
Summer Palace meets my expectation of a michelin star restaurant. Imperial Treasure is good enough, but Summer Palace is even better. Price wise, SP is a little pricey, but worthwhile.
4
Went for lunch with the family! Ate the most delicious pork, sea food dim sums.
Had an amazing crab soup and desert!
5
Food was delicious and nice atmosphere for a fathers day dinner. Entertainer app can be used for this restaurant too!
4
Not been here for 5 years and the last visit was a memorable one. The food then were great.
This time its not as good as previous but still slightly above average.
Service is good, atmosphere fantastic.
5
the food is excellent...the staff is superb...very hospitable...should try the weekend brunch..the food is unique and really good...
5
Had the weekend brunch menu. Easily the best lunch I had at a Chinese restaurant in ages. My favourites were the abalone chicken tart, bird nest dumpling and soon hock fish. Everything was delicious. And the variety of food... was very worth it for the price which was about $65 net pax. And the service was also fantastic. All the staff were polite and very sincere. Would come again
5
Our family of 9 had their weekend brunch menu and I must say that we were all surprised by the amount of food we had for the price we paid. Every dish tasted good too. Compliments goes to the chef as well as the staff . Service was excellent, given with a smile despite the fact that there were quite crowded
5
If you are seeking out stellar dim sum fare, this restaurant is certainly the place to dine at. I was with my family of 9, and the server was attentive enough to point out that they could cater to the specific number of pieces to be served. Not only that, I also requested for the dishes to be less salty and to have less oil, and the dishes were still as flavourful! Our tea was constantly topped up, the bone china plates were frequently changed. I highly recommend the siew mais and har gaos; the quality of the ingredients used were excellent. This is the perfect place for families to gather, especially if you have older folks that enjoy a delicious Cantonese meal. I managed to secure a parking redemption coupon, but it only covers the basement parking.

Yesterday I had the pleasure to visit this restaurant during my stay at the fab regents ! The best part about this restaurant is the amazing service !!! Like just truly beyond amazing... the wait staff appreciates your expectations even before your raise them ! Just truly love the people ! About food - great effort to provide a no pork and no beef menu as we requested .truly thank full to the chef for that . Great dim sums ... amazing soup ...the noddles with egg and crab were beyond perfection ! However the wonderful meal had a disappointing anti climax with below average deserts ! Was truly disappointed by the desert platter ... v average ! But the ower all a great experience and will def visit again !

Had a birthday lunch with my daughter and her friend today at Summer Palace today. We were comfortably seated next to the window overlooking the pool. We ordered a roast platter, fish noodles, 6 savoury and 2 sweet dim sum dishes. The steamed dim sum were so pretty and very nicely presented in little bamboo carriers and wooden box trays. Everything was as delicious as it was visually pleasing. The portions were just right- very satisfying without feeling over fed. The service staff was friendly and attentive.It was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.
4
enjoy the duck，two ways to eat：skin with pancake，meat have different way，we
chosed fry with black pepper，meat are juicy ，tender， good taste. cantonese style good，good taste
5
Summer Palace is always an excellent dining place with friends, families or even businesses.
The staff is attentive and food standard is definitely exceptionally good.
5
Great modern twist on Cantonese food. The food was delicious and presentation imaginative. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be going back to try more of this food. Service was very good.
4
Pool view, well-lit atmosphere for a romantic Chinese dinner between 2 of us. Not to mention, the Chef recommended food items were really worth the calories!
5
Good taste and presentation
Price reasonable
Car park redemption
Friendly staffs
Good ambience
Clean rest rooms

@TheKuoKnowsYou just know that service at Summer Palace will be a top priority when waiting staff iron tablecloths in situ to remove any traces of creasing.If the table linen is blemish-free, then the dim sum is totally flawless. Many dim-sum restaurants will try to get away with the bare minimum. Summer Palace goes the extra mile.The Yam Croquettes are dainty and perfectly sculpted to look like swans.There is not a hint of grease, which would suggest that the cleanest of oil is used in the preparation.A dim-sum restaurant is generallly judged by the quality of its Har Gao. Summer Palace's Har Gao are truly awesome.....Each prawn sat temptingly behind a gossamer thin veil of pastry.The dainty prawn dumplings were, however, surpassed by the delectable Char Siu Baos that perched like fluffy clouds in the bamboo basket.The service was more than first class. It was gold class. Not once was it necessary to lift the teapot to top up the tea.Well done Summer Palace
4
Had early mothers day here. Their staff is attentive and pleasant to deal with. Loved the crocodile with asparagus. Chewy but not overly so. Beef cubes with broccoli were medium rare and perfect. Groupa with eggplant was delicious too. They osmanthus jelly has honey - love it.
5
A group of 7 of us had dinner here and we were impressed with the elegant ambience, impressive cuisine and top-notch service!Must try is the Pumpkin Seafood Soup-generous portions of scallops, crab meat in a thick delicious broth served in a whole Pumpkin (you can eat everything except the skin). Don't know of any other restaurant serving this.Another highly recommended dish is the black pepper beef cubes-tender & oozing with flavour! Special place to celebrate special occasions or just to spoil yourself once in a while!
5
I have always enjoyed the food at Summer Palace. It offers Chinese food of a very high standard. I would like to applaud the fine culinary skills of the chefs, because every dish that comes out from the kitchen is perfectly done and presented. For bringing your guests, you will never go wrong. For bringing your family, it is an experience to keep

Regent Hotel is host to some really good restaurants in Singapore. Mention basilico, Seoul, tenshin and only good food comes to mind. Summer palace was no different, having dined for dinner. We decided to try the dim sum as well today. I liked the deep fried lobster rolls, the boluo char Siew Bao, the abalone siew mai, har kao, mixed chicken and prawn dumpling in spicy sauce but didn't like the roast pork...a bit chewy and some pieces tasted weird that my Nephew refused to eat. Didn't like the porridge as well. Porridge bland and condiments not crispy enough. Think it's been left a while after being fried. And didn't like the lobster 'Siew mai'. While it looks innovative but way too salty. And I think service is way too slow. No change of plate; no removal of empty plates; and worst of all...no refill of tea. We had to keep asking and in the end decided to just do it ourselves. At least the staff took the criticism elegantly. Well that kinda saved the service a bit. Overall, food is pretty good. Just avoid the ones mentioned. But service definitely needs to be more attentive. And if it's true that the restaurant is short handed and management knew but did nothing...according to one of the staff in suit...then I know why regent has been slipping in status.

It was a last minute decision to go there for CNY Lunch with our client. Prompt & good service! Delicious food. Nice environment & we could sit comfortably.
3
Lovely interiors and view from the restaurant. Service was good, although sometimes hard to catch the attention of the staff.
Food quality was good...
4
Went with family for reunion dinner. As usual they always use fresh good quality products. Although busy the staff did all it can to entertain our request.
4
Wanting to eat in a Chinese restaurant during Chinese New Year without having a 10 course meal this restaurant was perfect. The soft shell crab appetizer was our favorite. The staff was very welcoming and helpful
5
Beautifully decorated for the coming Lunar New Year. Tables are neatly arranged with ample spaces. Ambience is nice. Food is exquisitely cantonese and very tasteful. Serving portions are sufficient, not very fillings. Highly recommended.
4
This restaurant has been around for a Long time and yet able to keep it standards.
Recommended to come and try if you are around here.
5
food is nice, service is great too. Especially the staff guy wearing spectacle, he is very attentive.
5
Always a joy returning to Summer Palace. This time was for a loh hei dinner with my wife and kids. They always enjoy the dishes served here. The Chef never fails to impress with the consistency in quality of dishes. Soups are excellent....roast chicken is fantastically tender...seafood is beautiful and most importantly the ambience is relatively pleasant despite faint chatter in the background. Will definitely be back again soon

The Summer Palace Restaurant is a long established restaurant, with good service, ambiance, delicious authentic Cantonese food and an excellent venue for dining with family, with friends or for business. In May 2016 I did a review of this place when we had lunch. This time we were invited for dinner.The Restaurant is situated on the third floor of the Regent Hotel at 1, Cuscaden Road, set amidst elegant surroundings and attractive decor of antiques and paintings, complimented with piped Chinese music which was subdued that normal talking was possible. The lighting was more than adequate with views of the hotel’s pool through ceiling-to-floor glass panels.The first dish served was the complimentary birthday longevity buns. They were small in size and didn’t fill you up so that you’d be able to get through the following eight course dinner menu plus a slice of the birthday cake! The barbecued suckling pig, was served next on small wheat wraps, eaten with spring onion shoots and a brown sweet sauce. The skin was very crunchy and the combination tasty. This was followed by braised superior bird’s nest with lobster meat. The stock was very bland and lacked taste which was better after adding some vinegar. Lobster meat was well cooked. The braised South African abalone with mushrooms in oyster sauce came next. The mushrooms were firm and not tough, and the vegetables tangy and slightly bitterThis was followed by a combination of deep fried yam-coated scallops and stir-fried scallops with asparagus. I preferred the stir-fried scallops to the yam-coated ones. The asparagus was nicely cooked and complimented well with the scallops.The steamed Star Garoupa in soy sauce was very delicious and flavourful. The fish meat fresh and firm, crunchy to the bite.Minced pork with lettuce cup. This was the suckling pig “recycled”. The unserved pork meat returned after being chopped into very small bits and fried with pine nuts. I found the meat a little tough, but the freshness of the lettuce leave made up for this.The stewed Ee-Fu noodles with minced shrimps and mushrooms was also good, the mushrooms adding depth of flavour and crunch.Finally, we had the sweetened almond cream with ginko nuts and egg white. This was the eight dish served besides a slice of the birthday cake, by which time, we were pretty full already! Almonds are not everyone’s favorites, and many just ate the ginko nuts.The service was very good. Waitresses were attentive and watchful. Wine glasses refilled continuously. Used plates changed for clean fresh plates. As there were several big dinner functions held simultaneously that night in the same hotel, car parking was tight. Nonetheless, The Summer Palace fared very well both with service and food. Address: Regent Hotel, 1 Cuscaden Road, Level 3.Opening hours:Lunch:12:00 pm - 2:30 pm (Mon-Sat); 11:30 am - 2:30 pm (Sun)Dinner: 6:30 pm - 10:30 pm dailyDress: Smart casual Tel. +65 6725 328

You can't go wrong with fish noodles. Not many authentic Cantonese cuisine do this but Summer Palace never fails. The crabmeat on braised beancurd and my favourite Sweet & Sour Pork is sweet and tangy with crispy pork soak in the savoury sauce.Our favourite Julia restaurant manager provides attentive service as always.For a Thursday night, it is packed. It's no wonder why
4
I've eaten here a couple of times, the restaurant has quite an old fashioned hotel feel with well spaced tables. In my experience the service here is excellent, with an experienced and friendly front of house. The food is also delicious, particularly the cod.
4
The food was pretty good and tasty with a quiet and enjoyable ambience. However the wait for the food was a bit on the long side
5
The ambience was good and the food was delicious. The servers were very warm when they were telling us the dishes that were applicable for the entertainer app! I'll certainly patronise there again.
4
We had a great time at Summer Palace. Service portions were small but delicious. Deep fried sesame balls for dessert was excellent.
5
Food was great, especially liked the roasted duck with plum sauce. Staff provided good service. They were courteous and well mannered. Restaurant was well designed such that it is not overcrowded and conducive for a relaxing lunch.
5
Under Julia's watchful eye and with her helpful advice my wife and I ate a casual, light lunch and enjoyed it immensely. The Chinese rice wine (a very different version of a sake) and a cold Tsingtao were perfect complements to off menu lemon chicken and on menu lamb dishes. Both with matching fried rice that was, initially, almost too hot from the wok. Located in the Regent hotel, the restaurant in the form of a large, square room is a design classic with large tables for family and group eating. And there were many Asian families and groups enjoying a pre-Christmas Sunday lunch when we arrived somewhat late in the early afternoon and without a reservation. We were immediately made to feel welcomed guests by the hostess, and that set the tone for the whole experience. The first experience being the customary cold hand towels. Not inexpensive, but the value is there in a warm welcome, acceptable service (we had difficulty communicating with some of the younger wait staff, especially when they delivered to us food ordered for some other table), and food that was pleasing to our palates and, apparently, to the palates of many Asian nationals
4
Had an unpleasant start when we booked a table for lunch with friends and kids. We arrived early and waited till our timing and turn but yet was told to wait indefinitely as even though the guests had paid they are allowed to sit indefinitely ?? It turns out the incompetent staff didn't inform them the table is booked for a second seating and expects us to tell the guest ??? Only when the manager came to settle the issue that we got a table 25mins later. However the food was generally delicious. Everything we ordered was enjoyable and the kids ate quite abit which made all the parents happier. Would still recommend this restaurant to people but to Ensure that the booking staff actually do what they are supposed to do.
3
Not the biggest selection of dim sum and no peking duck was available on the weekend (we had roast duck which is not the same) so while the place is not bad and there are other things that you can order this is not one the the places that i would come back for family dim sum in a rus

The Summer Palace is located inside the Regent Hotel Singapore where we lived in our vacation. The food quality was averagely nice, the dim-sums were creative and somewhat fusion styled. The soup was nicely made inside a pumpkin, and the fried rice was fresh. However, the service really depends how lucky you are. If you are lucky enough, you might encounter waitress who are very attentive and might shoot the breeze with you. If you aren't lucky, you will encounter waitress that are ignorant, arrogant and rude, we encountered both types of waitress ( and the bad ones were terrible indeed). The ambience was overall nice but in a noisy environment. People in other tables were very noisy and disrupted discussions in our table or other silent tables ( in couples). The price was very unreasonable, the total price of 3 sets of meals + some dim-sum selection costs more than $2000 HKD, but not worth the price at all
5
Restaurant was conveniently located in up class Regent Hotel 3rd floor. Looked expansive and cozy with dedicated washroom. Had famous Peking duck at $92 with no extra cost for 2nd cooking style- must try! Salted egg fish skin appetiser, famous spare ribs with shrimp and 8-treasures fried rice were indeed wonderful. Service was noted friendly and helpful throughout.
5
Have a garlic and onion allergy. They wait staff and chefs ensured that all the food was free of onions and garlic.
4
Great food, excellent service. Ambience grand. Staff are friendly, helpful. Service is fast .
Food cooked to perfection. Tasty.
5
We had a family lunch of Dim Sum. The Char Siu Bao was fantastic.
It was really authentic and one of the best we had in Singapore.
4
Set lunch menu is really excellent and abundant. It was priced at 65 Sing a head . The service was excellent with an attentive waiter who gave us good explanations on the menu and the food. The tables are well separated from each other. Elegant setting
5
Went there for mom' s birthday Service was good even with such busy crowdMost importantly was food was excellent what we did was just informing the service staff to let the chef know that elderly can't take too salty due to health matter And chef really take all into consideration...not only that food was really great!!!Definitely s a must come again restaurant and will recommend friends and others to visit
2
food was ok but overpriced. Service slow due to busy time, which is acceptable. Most unacceptable was the first tall waitress who was so impatient that she kept complaining that our food choices was limited as my hubby can't eat seafood (for God's sake he is allergic to seafood and could trigger asthmatic reaction). She was speaking at top of her lungs that both my friend and I almost shout back at her. Carpark location was not ideal either. Will not go back and will tell family/ friends not to g
5
I enjoyed my tim-sum lunch at this restaurant. I believe this is one of the best places to dine during lunch time. Location of it within the Regent hotel makes it convenient for me to host business lunches. Hotel parking facilities makes it attractive.You can't go wrong on any item on the menu. So enjoy your meal.The price is affordable but on the top end of the price scale. Not for the average man on the street. However ideal business lunch restaurant. Highly recommended
4
Looking for Chinese meal after had quite a turbulence flight from Kuala Lumpur.. something easy and not spicy to comfort my stomach. Found this nice restaurant from TripAdvisor. We truly enjoyed the dim sum as appetizers with chrysanthemum tea. The steamed star groupa fish was really fresh and well cooked. We ordered little spicy stirred fried asparagus as well. So full that we couldn't get desserts. Hope to try next time. Definitely would recommend here for a good meal.
4
Was here for a dinner talk. Served with a typical 8 courses dinner in a Chinese restaurant. Had long heard about the nice food here and finally got a chance to try. Indeed, they served pretty nice food. Strongly recommended for the Double Boiled Seafood Soup in which they served in a steam pumpkin. Yes, you read it right. The 1/2 pumpkin worked a bowl and soup taste was simply beyond words.The fried rice was however rather bland. Otherwise, the whole course was generally quite an excellen
4
Whenever we have visitors from our European head office, we always cater food from Summer Palace. And it has not failed to impress so far.Today's lunch was to bid farewell to one of our beloved VPs, and this was one of her favorite restaurants.The signature dishes like Mango Shrimp and Egg Tarts were excellent as usual. The daily special Prawns and Celery stir-fry with Truffle was good also. Overall another excellent meal at Summer Palace. Highly recommended for business lunch, birthdays and other special occasions!Perhaps the server taking our orders could be abit more friendly and make more recommendations instead of just pushing the daily special
5
This has become my fav dim sum restaurant in Singapore. Absolutely perfect service and ambience, matched only by the great food.
5
This restaurant is inside the Regent Hotel and as such you can expect a very pleasant environment and excellent service. The food is very good, and of course the prices are not cheap, but I think overall they are reasonable (closer to mid-range than fine dining pricing)

We were invited to the Summer Palace Restaurant for a birthday lunch on Mother’s Day. The Restaurant is situated on the third floor of the Regent Hotel at 1, Cuscaden Road. Two Hong Kong chefs served up superb authentic Cantonese dishes amidst elegant surroundings and attractive decor of antiques and paintings, complimented with piped Chinese music which was subdued that normal talking was possible. Seated in one of the two private dining rooms, the lighting was more than adequate with additional natural light streaming through ceiling-to-floor glass panels.The first dish was steamed longevity buns with smallish buns so as not to fill you up, but wetted your appetite for the rest of the food to come. Next came the Appetizer combination of Wasabi Prawns, Soft-shelled crabs, Crispy Shimeji Mushrooms, Roasted Duck, Roasted Pork Belly and Jelly Fish. The prawns were quite large, lightly coated with wasabi and were succulent; the soft-shelled crabs tasty; the deep-fried Shimeji mushroom, crisp and light; the duck was tender and fragrant; the pork belly had a delightfully crispy skin and the jelly fish, crunchy and refreshingly flavored.Following this was the Braised Baby Abalone Soup with Dried Sea Food. Not too pungent, lightly acidic and sweet, with a generous amount of dried seafood and the baby abalone cooked to tenderness.Sautéed Scallops with Broccoli in X.O. Sauce. Scallops were cooked to perfection, succulent and nicely flavored and the broccoli not over done.Steamed Soon Hock in Superior Light Soya Sauce. Another delicious dish, well seasoned, the white flesh crunchy, complimented so well with the refreshing spring onion shoots and soya sauce.Roasted Crispy Chicken with Minced Garlic. Very generous portions with well seasoned crispy skin and tender meat. Very light garlic flavor.Braised Black Mushrooms with Bean Gluten and Garden Greens. The greens were distinctly bitter to taste, but the acidity and sweetness of the mushrooms balanced this out. The bean gluten was chewy, and lightly sweet as well.Sautéed Glutinous Rice with Air-dried meat and dried Shrimps was next. The rice was slightly sweet, this was paired with the slightly saltish Chinese sausages, a dark and a light colored variety, and with peanuts. There was a delicious after-taste.Chilled Mango Pudding came last as a desert. The pudding itself was a too thick or dense. There was some crunchiness from bits of rock melon cubes with the fresh cubes of mango fruit. Some color was added using few bits of Dragon fruit which really has little flavor.Our plates were changed after each course. The service was very friendly, polite, attentive and helpful, with a constant pour of our tea. Toilets are just outside the dining room. WiFi is available, but only if you’re a registered guest with a room. The Summer Palace Restaurant is a well established restaurant, certainly with good service and ambiance, delicious authentic Cantonese food and an excellent venue for dining with family, with friends or for business. I would recommend making reservations for a table, and this could be done on-line.Hours: 11:30AM–2:30PM, 6:30–10:30P

We may have disliked the hotel, but we had an excellent dinner here. The maitre d' guided our choices and we tried some interesting soft shell crab with "floss", a Singapore speciality, and very sharp lemon chicken with almonds. Beef with asparagus was succulent and pungent. All flavours were well balanced. More exotic ( to us) choices of fresh fish and seafood, crocodile, birds nest and abalone were also available
2
The service is below par. The food served was slow. We had to chase the staff a few times and requested for all the dishes to be served at the same time.The team leader was impatient and rude.The only saving grace is the food quality.
4
Good food, not cheap, okay surroundings, lacking service. Paid SGD900+ for 7 adults. But our server is really inexperienced. He did not even show us the full fish we ordered. He just proceed on his own to divide the fish in portion then only after asked if we wants him to portion it. Also, our plates are not changed after our dish of roast duck which leaves plenty of bones on our plates which leaves us having to eat from our not so platable plates. All of us were busy talking during the dinner to ask the waiter to change our plates
5
Some of the most inventive dim sum can be found here, although there is no compromising on the traditional flavours, an unfortunate fate that sometimes befalls those that experiment with fusion. Nothing could possibly disappoint! Just be adventurous and order whatever you fancy. If unsure, ask the helpful wait staff for recommendations

Good food and service have made our meals here over the years very pleasant and enjoyable. Being located off the main Orchard drag, you can have a relaxing meal here without having to raise your voice above the din to be heard.The restaurant plays it pretty straightforward with the food (no fushion inspired dishes here) which is great for those of us who want an old fashioned Chinese meal in a serene setting.The Peking duck, crab with egg served with lettuce, sweet and sour pork, double boiled soups, homemade tofu and ee fu noodles are all winners. The dim sum is good too. Service is friendly and helpful with the same front of house team running the restaurant efficiently for some time now. Julia and her team always take good care of us.We have dined here on weekdays and weekends, lunch and dinner. The experience always keeps us coming back

Breakfast buffet was outstanding---wide selection of top quality breakfast items including both continental and asian choices. Fresh fruits and baked goods were delectable, cooked to order egg dishes prepared before your eyes just the way you prefer them, multiple choices for breakfast meats including steak if you so chose and on and on...Service was friendly, attentive and responsive. Restaurant decor was very attractive and appealing

Summer Palace serves one of the best if not the best Cantonese Restaurant in Singapore.The service is immaculate, ambiance is great and a perfect setting for casual or business lunch. The serve a great Executive Set Lunch and they are very accommodating if you like to change certain dish or style as well a dim sumMy visit on the 28 December was for lunch with my family. We has some dim sum, barbecue platter and fried noodles-'Yee Mee' and we left the restaurant, delighted and full. Their dim sum is fantastic. The 'har kao' or prawn dumplings has some water chestnut which enhances the taste as well as make it very refreshing. Their deep fried prawn roll is fried to perfection- looks great and taste even better. The Barbecue Pork Buns with Pine nuts Aka 'Polo Pau' is 'to die for'. This is the first pick everytime we visit the restaurant and we even will arrange for take-away. We also had the pork dumpling with baby abalone and it exceeded our expectation. At most places when we have abalone, its usually too chewy and tough but this was so tender that even my 74year old mother in law gave a big thumps up.The Barbecue platter of soya sauce chicken, roast pork and barbecue was a hit with my 3 year old son. In fact he enjoyed the chicken and 'bak-bak' - pork in hokkien that he almost ate all the chicken by himself. The roast pork was roasted tpo perfection - crispy and yet tender and moist whilst the 'char siew' or barbecue pork was chunky, tender and not to overpowering with char-siew sauce like in many places. I did not try the chicken but from the way my 3 year old ate it, i an sure it was perfect.The fried 'yee mee' was fried to our liking. Both my wife and mother in law remarked that the texture was perfect and there were generous serving of quality ingredients.Very seldom do i say this of a restaurant with regards to price but i must say that for the quality of the food we ordered, the price was reasonable. The bill was around $170 for 4 adults and 1 child (one baby too but no food)In fact this lunch made up our minds where we will be celebrating my father-in -laws 80th birthday come March 2016.p/s: I celebrated my younger son's first birthday at summer palace in August and its where i normally bring my mother when she visits once every other month.

Chef Liu is creating excellent food from his Kitchen. Every single food coming out from his kitchen has been consistent

Love the spread of the buffet breakfast. The pastry is very fresh and yummy. Good choice of fruits and fruits juice, menu changed on daily basis. I enjoy the breakfast here.

We had a working lunch here last week. Overall reasonable food, but the service and presentation were just average. I would not hurry to return.

The Shang Palace in Paris has gained a reputation for fine Cantonese cuisine, and we were not disappointed the evening 6 friends gathered for a meal. The chef had prepared dishes highlighting seasonal vegetables and seafood. The lobster was exquisite. We shall return.

Deep Fried Prawns with Mango - heavenly.
Char Siew Pork Buns - delicious
Will return t the restaurant on our next visit.

The private dining room was elegantly prepared for our special family brunch. It will go down in family annals as epic. Course after course, it was flawlessly presented and delectable. The staff were exceptionally efficient and attentive. The Peking duck crispy skin rolled in a rice wrap comes to mind, as does the double baked pumpkin soup. Thank you, Summer Palace. Long may you excel

Typically don't trust hotel restaurants, but the a la carte dim sum surprised me. The whelk and fish maw tonic soup comes recommended on the menu and well worth the extra Sin dollars. For one person, 3 or 4 orders of dim sum would be sufficient. The 3 sorted seafood dim sum would be an excellent start.Above all, the service is friendly and attentive
5
Been there many times and each time, we are happy with the service + food. Keep it up. It will be great if there is a new menu for claypot rice!

It was my mum's birthday and Summer Palace's staff had been amazing in making this lunch wonderful. They gave us a free longevity buns for the birthday, and the service plus food were top notch! Would definitely go back for lunc

Was pretty for my reservation, however the restaurant called to check on me and was rather concerned if I knew my way. This has not happened to me before and I was rather surprised. Got to the restaurant and the lady could guessed that I was the guest she called earlier and showed me my seat! Service there was great, food was delicious. All in all a great Sunday brunch with my mates!I would definitely be back there

Here for GF's birthday celebration, the place is nice and foods are excellent and generous in size..
The attentive staff are 5 stars in servicing! We give them four thumbs up!

The Wasabi Prawns and Lemon Chicken were wonderful.
The Staff was gracious and eager to provide helpful suggestions.
My one issue was that the venue was overlit and so lacking in ambiance.
5
anbreakfast an excellent array of food, attentive service and a beautiful view of greenery from the window.

First and foremost, the restaurant is elegantly decorated. We were impressed with the set up, and we were welcomed with polite waiter who is very attentive to our request and prompt in service too.The food was nice and though we tried it for restaurant week menu, it was filling!The food is well done! Highly recommended if you are looking for a nice Chinese food setting

Overall good ambience and food quality. Service and ambience is tip top for summer place. Must try the "soft-shell crab with pork floss"

Summer Palace - as always - was outstanding for both its food and service. We went for the Claypot Special (which was awesome - go for the preserved meats!) they were having and requested for congee specially made for our toddler son so he wouldn't feel left out as we control his diet quite a bit. There was no procrastinating, no -trying to convince us not to do it- chat; just a simple 'sure, would you like it served now?' and voila! our son loved it and we appreciate the effort. thank you very much :)

Elegant setting, quiet posh rooms. Top notch service. Excellent food. Now that's what I call fine Chinese dining experience, 1 attentive waiter throughout - excellent faultless service!We had suckling pig platter, very good. Birds nest with scallop soup - flavorfully rich. Understated cod, browned to perfection. Abalone with spinach and a large mushroom- tender yet with firmness.prawn with asparagus and black truffle sauce- this is new dish and well executed. Venision, Yifu noodles rounded out the meal. Ah - the light and refreshing dessert - aloe vera lemongrass jelly in light syrup was just the right touch to end the meal!I wondered why I don;t come here more often and pack myself into those terribly crowded though excellent restaurants found at the in-town malls

Excellent Cantonese food, excellent service, I can highly recommend this place! We had a couple of the Chef's speciality dishes and all were excellen

We were guests ant the Regent and really chose to visit whilst we awaited our rooms. However much to our amazement this was one of the best Cantonese meals we have ever had. The beef and asparagus almost melted in your mouth, the lemon chicken had a super taste and crisp ( one of the chefs signature dishes), the honey BBQ pork delightful and ten squid fresh with salt and pepper to name a few things. The staff ensured excellent portioning and great service. It was also surprisingly good value. If you want a oasis and not hawker food, then this is great

I was very disappointed in the food presentation as it was not what I expected of the Four Seasons Group and what I saw from the photos posted and the food blogs. We had the set meal for two. It was just served like a homemade meal without much arrangement/presentation. Moreover, when the abalone was served, there were no functional cutlery to utilise and we were expected to consume our food in a not too civilised manner. Other restaurants like Jiang Nan Chun would provide a fork and knife for this dish. Admittedly, the food portions were rather generous and I was informed by the staff that's because it's a family restaurant
5
Do not miss this great dim sum experience. Full of well heeled locals enjoying it too. Very elegant room for lunch and dinner.

The staff could not have made us more welcome. We dined there on our first night with two tired children and the speed of service was really appreciated. The food was really fresh and delicious.

Would recommend to try once for good quality but small portions for restaurant week and regular prices look expensive too. More photos and details at http://www.eatprayflying.com/summer-palace-regent-restaurant-week/

if you want a quiet cantonese cuisine restaurant, this is it. been here over the past 15 years & quality has been consistently good.

One of our favourites in Singapore: elegant and good service usually. This time we had to stand waiting at the entrance for over 10 minutes as the maitre'd was nowhere to be found. The meal was fine, but for the first time the abalone was inedible: hard as a rock. Surprising for a restaurant of this quality

Enjoyed beautiful live then steamed fish cooked to order "Hong Kong Style". The restaurant menu was good, and the cuisine was good. The restaurant needs stronger leadership as no warm welcome from an experienced Maitre D' Hotel, and average service letting down the good cuisine. Good value for money
4
we went there for a business dinner, about 20 people.the restaurant is in the Regent hotel, just 10 minutes walk from Orchard Rd; huge lobby, modern design.the restaurant is what you'd expect from a high-end place in Singapore; we had a selection of chinese dishes, all of great qquality and taste.Good and timely servicequite on the high-end also for price, still withing the Singapore standar

Exhausted after a days shopping and trying to get back to our hotel in the drenching Singapore rain, getting lost in the process, we decided to eat in the hotel rather than venture outside again. The staff were very welcoming, explained the concept behind the family restaurant and suggested what to eat to make the most of our visit. The food was excellent, service very good and we were given an appetiser and small dessert as part of the meal. The cost wasn't cheap but it wasn't extremely expensive either and there are plenty of affordable dishes. We left after a great meal, satiated and with our humour restored after our trying afternoon.

The Regent hotel has retained much of its original heritage styling, but has through the years done modifications and minor refurbishing to keep with the times. Simply classic.Summer palace is as old as the hotel itself, and retains much authenticity of Chinese semi-fine dining. Having only 2 of us, we sampled the 5 course Power Lunch Set Menu ($52/person, minimum 2 person).The dishes are all deeply-rooted in Chinese cuisine, with minor modifications to keep it more interesting and premium. The dumpling skin for example comes infused with Spinach in the skin.1st course: Chef's dim sum selection - excellent dim sum, but don't eat the presentation garnish vegetables, it spoils the taste.2nd course: Double Boiled Seafood Soup served in Golden Pumpkin - my favourite dish. Clear soup double boiled to really get the flavour essence concentrated, it paired lovely with the stronger sweet, soft flesh of the pumpkin bowl that could be easily scooped with a spoon. The crab meat, prawns and scallops inside were also soft and tender, meticulously cooked separately due to varying ingredient cooking times.3rd course: Pan Fried Wagyu Beef with Soya Sauce - Being a Canton restaurant though, this is a distinctively Chinese dish with a premium touch to it. The beef was definitely tender and thankfully the soya sauce was not overpowering enough to mask the beef flavour completely. 4th course: Fried rice with seafood - Topped with dehydrated deep fried rice grains, the fried rice had a crunchy bite that brings an element of surprise to this common dish. A simple dish that can’t go wrong.5th course: Combination of Desserts which were Osmanthus Jelly, Mango Pudding with Pomelo, Sago Dessert. Another Chef’s special, the first 2 are time-honoured Hong Kong desserts that anyone who trained in Hong Kong needs to know. Special highlight to the Chef’s own creation of a Sago dessert, containing lemongrass jelly, aloe vera and lime juice with bits of fruit. A very refreshing jelly that clears your palate after the meal

Came here to have a food tasting for an upcoming wedding. For Chinese cuisine, the food is great and the serving staff gave us much attention.Check out the dessert with mango, wolfberries and aloe vera jelly. Refreshing and really good
