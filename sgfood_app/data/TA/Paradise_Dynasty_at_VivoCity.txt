First time visit this restaurant. The pork dumplings is amazing! Each piece of dumpling come with soup. And the waiters here all are friendly and professional. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends for sure!

This restaurant offers good food and services. The ambience was also appropriate for casual occasion.

Great food & more importantly, consistent quality!
Love the peanut appetiser (served at all Paradise Group restaurants).
5
Very happy with the food and the view. Speed of the food delivery is fast. Enjoy our time here with 2 small kids. Will visit again.

Pre Christmas lunch with family with great food experiences. Dumplings are really good and Foie Gras and truffles variety are amazing. Nice place and service with full view to Sentosa and Bay.. fully recommended.
4
The staffs are polite and food is generally good.Xiao Long bao is good and mushroom sauce noodles is tasty too. Drunken chicken is not good. Otherwise recommendable for family.
5
Went to eat dinner with my family and was served by friendly waiters and waitresses. Price was very reasonable for the good food along with an ocean view. Favourite food is the colourful xiao long bao! Overall a lovely time spent with my family at this restaurant.

We usually go to paradise dynasty as there are various of food that our kids like a lot and taste yummy! And for this vivo branch, my kids can enjoy the good view at Sentosa and they always feel so fun to see a lot of different colour of monorails that help us to “auto”- entertain them, lo

I have the luck to have some friends in Singapore Who brought me to Paradise dynasty, I must say that is one of my favorite places Since then. Great staff, good location and a very interesting menu. Foie gras dumplings lead the list among the dumpling selection which is the restaurant signature dish.Price is definitely reasonable
5
Had twice dinner there! The dumplings are sooo yummy! We tried a lot of different food and everything tasted really yummy! I could have ordered the whole menu!
5
Generally v gd friendly service, n gd food. Better and cheaper than Crystal jade in my opinion. The pork and prawn dumpling skin was v smooth and thin. The special 8 flavoured xiaolongbao was fun too. Though the crab roe one was a bit fishy.
5
Coming from New Zealand pricing, this was great value for money - we spent $70 which included 5 dishes plus drinks as we wanted to try a big selection. The service is friendly and fast, and the food was fantastic. Worth going if in Singapore!
5
The soup dumplings are fantastic. The Szechuan crispy chicken unbelievable and the garlic spinach left nothing to desire. A MUST.

Ordered a wonton soup and drink. Took a long time for meal to arrive. The soup was ok, but lacked greens and noodles.When we paid we were surprised to see they had charged us for what we thought was complimentary appetizer (we didn't order) and serviettes. An 8.80 meal turned into 35.00 after tax and charges for complimentary appetizer. When mentioned at time of paying they replied 'Next time say no to complimentary appetizer' lol.Save your money and go to food court dim sum

Love paradise for its huge portion size and tasty food, always having quality and quantity. Service too was excellent, friendly and attentive staffs that always introducing us promotion or asking for member's card to help us get discount off the meal.Egg white - favorite dish! Healthy, protein packed, light and delicious. This portion serves up to 2 small bowls full to the brim. Adding extra vinegar makes the whole fish taste even better!Fried mantou - served with condense milk sauce, the mantou was sliced to allow for easier consumption. Deep fried till crispy but not greasy, inside still soft and fluffy!Radiah pastry - also a hot fave of ours. Really hot when served, the filling will burn your tongue if you are greedy like us to eat it immediately when it's served. Radish inside is moist, flavors a little sweet with the radish jus, thick. Outside pastry is very crispy and crunchy, exact opposite of the radish inside and it compliments each other really well in texture.Pork chop - kind of regretted the mayonnaise flavor, the mayonnaise was too much and tasted sticky inside of thick and creamy. Pork chop however was great, thick chunky with the meat cooked tender. Really large portion.Pork dumplings ramen - this dish is nice too but the chilli vinegar sauce is not enough to cover the whole ramen so it tasted a little dry for the parts that didn't get the sauce. Pork dumpling is good, soft and chewy, juicy filling. Ice Chinese tea is served in a COLD teapot and to be poured yourself into a tea cup. Interesting. Overall a wonderful experience

Another family gathering requiring two tables. The staff arranged a private room that had lovely views over Sentosa and in the evening light was really appreciated. The food was served to both tables in copious amounts by very friendly and competent staff. I liked the rustic ambience of the restaurant and the food was superb. I'd like to thank Connie, Mei Jie and Woo Na in particular, great staff are hard to come by!

I came here yesterday with a friend to have dimsum for dinner as both of us share a great love for dimsum! I'm no stranger to Paradise Dynasty at ION and thought it would be a nice change of air to diner at Paradise Dynasty Vivocity instead. Although food was good, it was not close to what I'm used to from ION. I found personally that the skin of the Xiaolong Baos or steamed pork dumplings to be somewhat thicker compared to those at ION. This leads me to believe that there are inconsistencies between these two outlets as this is not the first time that I've experienced this. However, the taste is still extremely flavourful and so are their other dishes. Service was rather a let down at first as our drinks came extremely late. We had to remind the service staff 3 times to bring us our Coke Lights, only to be met with mere nods and an "OK". It was not a good experience for me to be having to say "Excuse me" every 7 minutes. It was only when a manager stepped in, Connie Wong, who was then extra attentive and salvaged the service. She made sure that we were well taken care off, so kudos to her! Alas, it would definitely be a while before I head to the Vivocity outlet and stick to the ION one instead #likesfromstep

A great place to experience Chinese food in Singapore. The food is simply amazing and full of flavours. Two things that still remain on my mind are the La Mian in Hot and Sour Soup (my partner had it; a bit too spicy for me, but still very tasty) and their signature dish: The World's first 8 Flavoured Xiao Long Bao (Dumplings). Service is also extremely good and friendly. Worth the waiting time, as the queues can be very big to get in
5
Brought a friend from Taiwan for lunch there. We had the popular 8 pieces assorted soup dumplings, fried rice, pork with minced garlic and some vegetables. The food was nice, kind of similar to Ding Tai Fung. Ask for a table further in for a better view. The staff service was excellent, very friendly, helpful and attentive
5
We have tried other soup dumplings in Asia and thought best dumpling at paradise dynasty! The assortment dumplings are colorful and delicious !
Lotus bun with egg yolk also excellent ....must try !

Hosted lunch with our high school friends for a visiting couple from Penang. They were staying with relatives on Sentosa Island. We had a table with sea view. We enjoyed the good food and catching up with old friends..
1
Not really that good and service were poor.
A little bit expensive based on what we hv ordered.
Ambience also not so good and noisy.
Unfriendly staff and Nor so experienced.
Should hv more training
4
We went for business lunch. Ordered their famous colourful Xiao long bao. It was nice though some taste a bit odd. Original is still the best. Service was prompt. Worth going there again.
4
Their food is tasty!! especially the "Wonton La Mian" in pork bone soup which is probably the best dish out of their whole menu in my opinion, tried their colorful dumplings as well, like the fact that it has 8 different flavors inside the dumplings, good variety and taste!! Affordable place with comfortable seats, best to sit near the kitchen where the chefs prepare the food. I didnt try their spicy La Mian as I cannot take spice well, but you should try their other signature non-spicy La Mian!
4
The idea behind the 8 different dumplings was novel. Having ordered 2 sets for the family (i.e. each of us going for the flavour(s) we are open to trying), it was an enjoyable experience. I ate the ones infused with ginseng, foie gras and black truffle. I thought the execution was good in that the intensity of taste was appropriate and I liked all the three flavours. The other dishes such as the diced chicken fried with dried chilli and garlic, fried Ee Fu noodle, etc were done right too. It's worth a revisit with the right company.
3
Came here for dinner. Both food and service in this restaurant are average. The fried pan cake with red bean was pretty tasty though. Not too sweet. Prices here are above average but not too expensive. We ordered 2 meat dishes, 1 vege and 1 dessert. Cost us ard AGD60/-.
3
It is one of the Paradise group chains specialising in shanghainese food. Standard la mian, dim sum and some chinese food. Special at Vivo City, 50% off from 15:00-17:15pm for Lamian, dim sum and dessert only. Very worth it. But the taste is just standard, good. Nothing special

Paradise Dynasty LEGEND OF XIAO LONG BAO-Singapore.Foodies eyes here: 8 distinct flavours in various colors; meet the ultimate Specialty Dynasty Xiao Long Bao of Paradise Dynasty. These are: 1. Original 2. Ginseng 3. Foie Gras 4. Black Truffle 5. Cheesy 6. Crab Roe 7. Garlic 8. Szechuan. Enjoy each flavour in sequence to ensure the optimum level of culinary experience. The instruction continues hence we follow: lift the Xiao Long Bao out from the steamer with chopsticks and place on a spoon. Use chopstick to prick a hole and let the steam out. Sip the soup from the spoon. Then dip it gently into black vinegar, with ginger if you prefer. But to enjoy each unique taste, eat it on its own. My two faves: Black Truffle and Szechuan. I love the whole concept. It is fun, exciting and unique

I ordered just 3 things one Sunday afternoon - stir fried cabbage leaves, pan-fried shanghai pork buns, and their top seller, the specialty dynasty xiao long bao with 8 international flavors. It was obvious that the xiao long bao would be a winner. There was even a sequence to enjoying it - start with the regular flavor and work your way up to the spicy Szechuan flavor. Soup inside the dimsum was hot and tasty. My advice is to finish it before the soup goes down to room temperature. The pork buns were a good complement, with its crispy bottom and soft dough. Slightly soupy too, inside. This place is recommended not only for its food but also for its ambience and good location, overlooking Sentosa Island.

Don't look at the price. This is the Chinese restaurant u want to be. Delicious authentic southern Chinese cruising. Nice view too. Service is good. Staff is friend.
5
We come here every time we are in vivo city.. Food is excellent and the service has improved massively since 2 years ago..
5
I have been to this restaurant many times, and always have excellent experience with the food and speedy service from the hotel staff
Will definitely come back to this place in near future
5
Don't visit smack during peak dinner times, you have to take a queue number. If you are impatient, go some where else. My partner and I love the truffle and foie gras xiao long bao. Slightly pricey for 6 but the flavor of both the truffle and foie gras complements the xiao long bao very well. We had both xiao long baos for dinner together with two bowls of noodles and it came up to about $70. It's slightly pricey but if u go with groupons - it's about a $20 discount on this price. So at $50 it's ok. The noodles are tasty (zha Jiang Mian) and we also like the fried rice there. Servings are big enough for 2 small eaters. I have no problems with service and we have visited this branch twice over the last one month and all waiting staff have been nothing but overwhelmingly friendly.
3
Went to the restaurant hoping to enjoy the service and food like other paradise restaurant but was disappointed. Not a lot of crowd but service was slow. Ask to remove the snack and wet towel but have to ask 3 different servers before they act on it. Ask for the rice to be served but despite all dishes served, the rice took forever. Food was the same like the other restaurant. Given a choice, will not be back there despite the food was nice

Tried the Paradise Dynasty at ION Orchard many years ago and my memory of the food there was not bad. Had dinner at Paradise Dynasty at VivoCity and dining experience was certainly not the same.Environment was nice, tables were well spread out and not crowded at all during a weekday night.The original Xiao Long Bao was average. Even though good amount of broth inside, the meat actually tasted dry. The meat and broth are not integrated together.Drunken chicken was average; I expected more from this restaurant.Fried rice is also average and not memorable.Ma Bo Tofu was the only dish that was above average. A good balance of heat and taste.Service was poor. The diners at the next table left for more than half hour and no one came to clear.Probably will not return

While the restaurant menu is good and the food decent, the service is atrocious. You are expected to go to the counter and get a counter number, which should be simple enough. However, they don't follow their own system and keep overriding it. As a result, we ( a family of 6) had to wait for an extremely long period waiting while there were sufficient empty tables in the restaurant to west us. The lady at the counter just ignored out requests for an update, rudely telling us to wait. In the meanwhile we saw larger as well as smaller groups saunter in, while we kept standing outside. You can see from the photo that the waiting crowd is not that large, but our wait was close to a an hour and a half.Absolutely ridiculous and the restaurant succeeded in ruining a perfectly decent family meal by turning it into an ordeal. Will go to Din Tai Fung in future

~a spacious dinning area with fall to ceiling windows overlooking the port on the right and sea on the left~we ordered lotsa items to taste and all of them were tasty! All the Xiao Long Bao's were delicious, filled with super tongue scalding soup inside be careful least you burn your taste buds and can't taste anything else!!!# Deep-fried pork ribs tossed in mayonnaise - lardered on the outside crisp layer before a juicy boneless pork rib YUMz x2# Scrambled egg white with fish & conpoy - a specialty but does not appeal to my more hard hitting tastes, yet it's as fluffy as it looks and super for the health conscious YUMz# Radish Pastry = DDMT AMAZING super duper delicious yam covered by delicate pastry a master craft in itself YUMz x5Definitely a great restaurant with something for everyone :
5
Went there with my partner and ordered a little too much than necessary. Had the appetizers of cucumber salad, shredded potato, hot and sour soup, noodles and pork with pancakes. We also had some steamed buns which we couldn't finish. As we got up to leave, a staff serving the next table noticed that we didn't finish our buns and asked if we would like to pack it away as it was a shame that we didn't finish. Though it's a small gesture, I felt that her keen eye to detail sets the place apart. Have visited this particular outlet a fair few times and am very happy with the service and food
4
Had to try the taster menu. Unique flavours and well worth trying. Prices very reasonable and plenty of staff. Only problem, we ordered water and soft drinks and had to remind the staff after 20 minutes when the first course arrived. Having been over to Sentosa for the day we were thirsty and hungry, in that order! Still. It's well managed, the food is great and I would return without hesitation. Next time I will remind them sooner if the drinks don't come
4
Visited with wife for lunch. We took dim sum, beef and noodles. All of them was nice and reasonable. Ambience was also nice!
3
Location: Good. Level 3 of Vivocity (Shopping Complex). Food: Fair to good depending on what you order. Service: Good friendly staff.
5
Nice place to have a meal after shopping.
Not too busy and expensive.
I enjoyed delicious food in casual mood.
5
Delicious Chinese cuisine with speciality Xiao Long Bao, different cloloured and flavoured dim sum. Other dishes provided are fresh and vibrant and the peanut noodle dish is especially good.
5
We actually went to the one at Ion city but it was closed for the New Year. So a taxi ride away was the one at Vivo city. Servive was fast and courteous. The menu was varied and the prices were about reasonable for Singapore prices. The dishes were certainly delicious and very well prepared so the price was not an issue.
4
This restaurant takes soup dumplings to the next level with specialty flavors like fois gras, black truffle, & cheese. The sampler basket is a perfect way to try and see what you'll like best. The restaurant can be tricky to find within VivoCity, and our service was quite slow. Prices aren't cheap, but the food was worth the price.
5
Paradise Dynasty is famous for their authentic Chinese dim sum. However, a less known delicacy also on their menu are the sesame mochi balls. This is known on the menu as "Rice Ball with Grated Nut". It is a mochi ball with sesame paste filling and grated nuts on the outside. It arrives at your table freshly made, so if you eat it immediately, the hot sesame paste will burn your tongue. Each mochi ball is bite-sized, and slightly chewy. It's also delicate, so if you squeeze the ball, the sesame paste will leak. The xia long bao comes in 8 flavors: Original, Garlic, Black Truffle, Ginseng, Szechuan, Foie Gras, Cheese, and Crab Roe. The liquid is quite hot and flavorful. Paradise Dynasty is one of my number one restaurants in Singapore
5
I am obsessed with the food here. The xiao long bao is heavenly. I like the broth inside of it. I would recommend you lift it up and put it in a soup spoon. Then puncture the side of it with your chopstick. Suck out the juice once it seems warm enough (yummy). I would recommend this restaurant to everybody who wants to taste heaven.
4
Always my favourite. I would give ding tai Fung a miss but paradise dynasty's xiao long Bao a must to satisfy every individual appetite.The dough (skin) of the xiao long Bao is so soft n delicate but simply one bite .... The beautiful juice breaks n whet your mouth with flavour of each individual xiao long Bao.I had eight of a different kind. A first in the world n not the last. Every one did not disappoint.Even the dumplings with egg noodles were a delight

I have always wanted to try their special "8 Colours 小笼包 (xiao long bao aka XLB)" but have heard mixed reviews about it ranging from "it's nothing special" to "wow, it's so unique. I love it".Dined there earlier last week and the waitress told us that there was a Groupon promotion ($29 for $50 worth of voucher) which everyone was using, valid until 6 Nov. Hence, we bought the Groupon, and came by to patronise the much-reviewed 8 colours 小笼包.Our order:- 8 colours 小笼包: I tried 4 flavours while my partner tried the other 4. Cheesey flavour was one of my favourites among the 4 that I've tried. The gooesy, salty texture of the cheese blended well with the pork in the XLB. The Garlic version was fragrant and again another successful combo. The Ginseng version fell short of my high expectations as the ginseng soup tasted awkward as a XLB. Lastly, the Crab Roe was the least of my favourite as there was a very strong crabby smell. Yes, crab smell. I love crab but this was overwhelming and had to down the XLB with a gulp of water.- Yang Zhou Fried Rice: The Ding Tai Fung version is much better and definitely more fragrant. The rice was ordinary at best and tasted kinda bland. We added some green chilli and sambal to salvage the dish.- Spinach and Glass Noodles (Appetizer): Love this. Simply refreshing. It comes in a small plate so it is good for sharing.- Potato Shreds (Appetizer): Disappointed as it tasted kinda bland. The versions I had in other restaurants and in China were abit more tangy, sourish with just a hint of spiciness.- Crab Meatball Soup: Comfort soup. The huge crab meatball tasted like a softer version of the XLB pork.So after tasting the 8 Colours 小笼包, my verdict is to try it once, decide on your favourites and order those in the future. However, as I am one who favours traditional food in their original flavours, I would still order the original XLB basket on my next visits. The noodles looked good too and would definitely be on my to-order list
4
I like dining here. Definitely not a location for cheap food though. Expect to pay around S$30 per pax.
5
Excellent food, fast service at a reasonable price point. A pleasant experience, fast service with authentic taste.
3
food wasn't that good. Quite expensive and serving time a bit slow. Appetiser doesn't taste or look good.
3
We went there for dim sum. The food is very average and we do not really enjoy the restaurant nor the food. The price is high for what we get.
4
A big new place that serves terrific dumplings (we did like the multicoloured set) and other great traditional dishes. Vegetables were lovely, as well as deserts. Great respite from shopping...
4
Restaurant has great views of Sentosa and can easily accommodate big crowds -- it's perfect for a special event. The speciality is Xiao Long Bao, the traditional Shanghai dumpling. Unlike many other restaurants, this place has taken it much further by incorporating different flavors in 7 first-of-its-kind types: Ginseng, Foie Gras, Crab Roe, Cheese, Black Truffles, Garlic and Sichuan. And they come in different colors as well. Our favorites are the Foie Gras and Crab Roe. Restaurant also has a full Chinese Menu including 18 kinds of silky hand-made La Mian. Prices are reasonable, and the service is efficient and prompt
4
Good food especially the dumplings. But other food are of great quality too - we tried the bamboo shoots, the shanghainese braised pork etc. not halal and if one is on the wheelchair, if it is not raining, can use the outer part of the walkway to get into the restaurant. if not, those on wheelchair and its raining, its challenging I would sa
3
Haven't tried this brand of restaurant before. As previous trip adviser mentions, took a while to get service and tables remained uncleaned...all down to being understaffed (note, staff that were there were all very polite.)Quality of food was good and the price wasn't too bad.Would I go again? I might try another outlet but it's not a reflection on this place. We weren't in a hurry and the place wasn't crowded (late lunch.) It might have been a different story if it were peak time. If you haven't been to Vivo, this is a nice restaurant to try but advice is take a copy of the pictures or use someone who speaks Chinese to interpret the menu. It's a typical list where you tick items.If this is useful then please take time to say so. Thank
1
Seriously under staff. Took 5min before I can grab someone's attention to order food. Staff attitude also not very polite. It's a weekend they should expect a crowd but the ratio of staff to customer is like 3 to 50.Food not fantastic. Will not visit again.There r many other paradise outlet with good service like psa building etc
4
Dumplings tried, Original and the "Ma la" Pok Dumpling - Both were exquisite!!The other dish that impressed me was the Poach Beed in Szechuan spicy soup.......quality ofthe beef was very good. Tender and fresh...... just the right spiciness. I opted for the mild version,just becareful with the small little "ma la" peppers that will numb your mouth if you bite into them.Usually the lamien is quite good as well, i had on a previous visit had the spicy beef noodles but this visit i found the noodles a wee bit soggy....... perhaps i should have had it immediately when they served...... i was too busy with the abovementioned dishes and afew other appetizers. Overal
