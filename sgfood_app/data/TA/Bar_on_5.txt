This is one of the few places (we have found) on Orchard Road where you can sit down in an uncrowded air conditioned bar and have a long cold beer or two. Very expensive though...

If you are a big drinker maybe look for a cheaper option - but if you want to enjoy a great collection of spirits without the "working girls" - this is a great place while in Singapore.

Had a few drinks here as i was staying at the hotel. The craft beer is alright but mostly japanese. i have no problemwith this but there are days when you want a nice crisp lagerwhich they did not have.the male bartender was very nice and friendly. gave a lotof good tips and recommended other drinks.would have given it a higher rating but i noticed this chapsoliciting and making small talk with the other guest. at firsti did not mind it but he was there almost everytime i was there.oh well

We were inside this bar on the 5th floor of Mandarin Orchard for barely 1 hour. Just had 4 beers with a friend. Served with stir-fried peanuts.What caught my attention is the setup. Plenty of comfortable single sofas around a small circular table and some taller table groupings. This allows accommodation of both small and large groups.Environment is remarkably relaxing, with an onsite DJ providing endless music for the clientele. No unnecessary monologues, just simple music with good beats. Frankly, I didn't know this place existed in Mandarin Orchard. No need to go out and find a bar elsewhere.It was a good drinking experience.

I'm an "occasional regular" at Bar5 and I have always enjoyed my TGIFs there. It's an affordable drinking hole with 5-starred hospitality. However last Friday, I was both appalled and sorely disappointed with the service of a staff named Julie. Here's what happened:1. I asked for help connecting with wifi. She took my iPad, stared at it, tinkled a little, gave it back to me and walked away without saying anything. I thought she had sorted it out for me but turns out she did nothing. I'd understand if she'd just tell me she didn't know how instead of just walking away.2. My friends and I wanted to make a second round of order. We asked for the menu and she came back with one. While my friend was looking at the menu, I asked if she could bring another one cause I wanted to order too. She looked at me and pointed to my friend, indicating to me that I should just wait for my friend to be done. Then she just stood there like a rock and refused eye contact. 3. More friends came to join so we asked for the menu again. She probably got fed up with the no. of times she has to serve us the menu. This time she just dropped the menu on the table and walked away with a black face.Bar5, please QC your staff attitude. It really damaged my experience that night

Located within the Mandarin Orchard hotel, this expansive bar boasts an impressive drinks list containing decent wines, excellent Japanese craft beers on draught, a wonderful selection of international whiskeys with a slight lean towards the Japanese variety. All this, with a good snack menu ensures great overall ambience

Bar on 5 is located on level 5 of the Mandarin Orchard and is a great place to unwind with a couple of drinks before bed. Offering both inside and outside seating there are plenty options for patrons depending on the weather. Prices are in keeping with what you would find in most similar venues in Singapore. Staff are professional and attentive with a large range of beverages on offer especially whiskey. Good atmosphere with music that is not too loud so keeping up a conversation isn't difficult, well worth a visit, cheers..

The Bar on 5 has a small section run independently called YAKUMI, which has a small but great selection of craft beers. It is a great addition to the Bar on 5 which is a far larger bar with patio and the counter seating. Level 5 is the check in level of the Mandarin hotel and the bars are located directly across from the front desk. There is a limited selection of bar food but the selection and presentation of the craft beers from around the Orleans somehow makes it very special

Great selection of whiskeys and good package prices. We has a smashing good time there with our friends and there is even a DJ at this bar!

Hotel bars are typically boring (and quiet), but this is none of that. It is always buzzing with excitement. They have an amazing collection of whiskies.

This is a nice little bar to unwind in. The bar staff are very efficient and knowledgeable. It's pretty small and can be a bit raucous when there are large groups but it's still a nice spot for a drink.

After a swim I needed a nice refreshment so went to this bar where I enjoyed a wonderful Pina Colada. I also ordered some bar snacks (prawns) which were lovely. The service was fantastic!

This is a very pleasant bar with plenty of staff. The downside is that a beer and a coffee will set you back S£34.50 ( approx £17.50)
5
Nice music, cozy and various drink and wine choice. Always stop for a beer or a bottle wine after check in before sleep.

The bar /lounge is situated on the 5th floor of Mandarin Orchard. This is a very good location for after-work drinks or for serious whisky drinkers. There are great whisky promotions every Wednesday. These range from Japanese whiskies like Hakusho, Nikka and Yamazaki to premium scotch like Chivas, Macallan, Balvenie and Johnny Walker Gold Label. The promotion is mainly a 3-bottle promo which allows you to get your whisky at a truly great price.The place is managed by Terrance and ably assisted by Pauline.There are whole bunch of wonderful staff like Joe, Tony, Ray, Dennis, Cecilia, Margaret who can be counted on to help you get your drinks and explain the promos. There are both indoor and outdoor areas to suit your preference with either high tables or low lounge chairs. The standing smoking area is situated outside.There is also a great food menu. The beers and wine are are slightly expensive for the happy hour crowd. However the place more than makes up for it with a chill ambience and music. Do check up its facebook page for details of upcoming whisky and other promotions

This bar is at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel so it's almost always packed with tourists. Their drinks list is pretty limited and standard as is the bar food selection. But the service is great. And there's a smoking area conveniently located in the outdoor sitting area. Go there only if you're stuck on Orchard Road.

Really bad service. Not accommodating at all. The manager says if there are more than 8 people in one table we will need a minimum spend of 50 for each person. It's not even a full house here a lot of tables are empty. Will never come back here again

Great selection of beverages but stuck with my favorites. I was surprised by the lack of attention in the service considering the prices being charged. Pleasant environment with comfortable seating. If i was a guest in the hotel, it would have been OK, but since it was a business meeting, it did not live up to my expectations
4
It is a nice bar across the lobby of the Mandarin Orchard hotel in the fifth floor.
The environment is fine, service is nice but the prices are (at least compared to my reference level) at a very high level.
5
Postive: This offers high quality food and very good services, right at Mandarin Orchard hotel
Negative: None

This bar was a popular spot. Very busy but good service. Just had a couple of drinks there prior to going out.

Nice happening place, with a mix of lovely young singles and old tourists.Not necessarily the trendiest bar in town for the trendiest trendsetters, but a nice place to have a drink.

Drinks decent pricing , variety of choices, great japanese whisky, finger food choices, music. A all in bar to go. But it smell

Why Bar on 5? Because the old store was sitting on unit 5.They never changed the name or adapted a new one.Even the establishment looks a very rustic Asian-Spanish bar, my kind of place. I love the cusions and the huge wooden chair inside.

Best staff and fabulous drinks. Dennis will make you the best cocktails ever and Margret and the other wait staff are just top knock. Great place to hangout after work very nice atmosphere.

Nice Bar with quite fast service. Quite extensive list of drinks and vine list. Good music and also nice local people around.
Good atmosphere.

I went here a couple of times during my stay at Mandarin Orchard. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is quite relaxing and not too noisy.Drink prices are in line with anywhere else in Singapore, so not too expensive.Nice place to have a drink while waiting for colleagues

This bar is good for meeting friends of colleagues, especially if you're staying at the Mandarin Orchard. The service was friendly and quick. The only downsides were that it was a bit too dark (ambiance can only go so far before you can't see your drink) and the music was unbearably loud. Stop for a night cap on the way back to your room but don't plan on staying too long
