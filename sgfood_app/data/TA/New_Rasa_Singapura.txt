Pretty decent local food. Had the chicken satay, char kway teow, chicken curry, chap chye, and seafood soup. Food was an overall 8.5/10. Nice ambience as well. Great place to gather the mates for drinks.

A social enterprise that serves delicious hawker food at reasonable prices and is just a stone's throw from the busy shopping street of Orchard Road and Botanical Gardens. The place feels even more magical at night under the hanging lights.

Discovered this little gem recently...
Hawker food in a chilled setting with very reasonably-priced alcohols, drinks & food
+ Spend to support their mission to employ & train the less-fortunate among us... What's not to love?!!

Good place for local hawker fare and reasonably price beer
Service was good and centrally located :)

This restaurant advertises itself as being "socially responsible", that is, hiring people with various "challenges". You'd never know it from our experience; our waiter recited our six item order without error. The food was excellent, and prices were very reasonable, especially for booze. Service was great, food beyond reproach. If you're staying at Hotel Jen or the Regent, thus restaurant should be high on your list

Tried the dry laksa, black pepper char kway teow and soursop juice which were all great! Will be back to try the rest of the dishes. Prices are reasonable (no GST & service charge!!) However as the restaurant has only outdoor seats, the mosquitoes were feeding on our skin like crazy and had to see a doctor to take care of the 20 mozzie bites (yes 20 not kidding).... would suggest the restaurant to place some mosquito repellent products around the area to avoid this. Will be back for the food but will ensure that I don't expose my skin to the mozzies the next time round!!!

Had dinner on a weekday night as a party of 4 adults and 2 children. As a local, I found the food very good. The menu items were mostly Singapore favourites with some international items. We ordered Satay, vegetable Rojak, Dry Laksa, Hokkien Mee and Char Kway Teow. All the food was very delicious.There is a large outdoor seating area (not sure if there is indoor seating), it is fully sheltered with a lot of fans and air coolers. It is a great place for a casual meal to enjoy good Singapore food in a setting that is a lot more comfortable than in a hawker centre at prices that are of course higher than at hawker centres, but still very reasonable. There is an extensive beverage list so you can spend a relaxing time there after eating. The staff are very attentive and helpful. For information this restaurant operates as a social enterprise, meaning that some of their staff are disadvantaged or have disabilities and may otherwise have difficulty finding employment. I think you can read more details on its website, But it's wonderful to have an establishment give back to society and New Rasa Singapura serves great food too. So this place is really worth a mention

Went for a walk around the area and decided to have a snack, was getting near to lunchtime and had just been around the Singapore's Botanical gardens (Review to follow) and decided to have a couple of drinks and to order food, the hospitality was great, kind and welcoming staff, they were very helpful and explained certain meals/menu's.Would I go again to this restaurant? YES would I recommend this restaurant to other? YES. Thank you guys will be in again when we are next over.

Not a bad place. Love the satay, prawn paste chicken. Lime juice nice tooWe tried the crayfish curry fish head fried oyster - all not so bad Nice place to hang out but a little far for tourists like me who need mrt train as it is almost a 15 min walk in the hot weather

New Rasa Singapura is located next to Tanglin Post Office and it serves awesome local cuisine. My personal favorite includes their dry laksa, char kway teow and curry. The dry laksa is especially fragrant, not too spicy and I like that the noodles has absorbed the essence of the gravy. Price is reasonable with no gst and service charge. Their lunch item is $8 (avail Mon-Fri) and one can top-up drinks for $2.

Fantastic food. The menu is excellent and everything tastes amazing. The service from the staff is excellent.
A must go to place. Fantastic value.

At Tanglin Post Office, just opposite Tanglin Mall. It serves very good local hawker food which are tasty, and nicely prepared. It is a social enterprise that provides jobs for the underprivileged who work as their waiters, cooks etc.

Was there for a company lunch last Friday 18 August 2017. Was informed that our lunch starts from 1330hrs to 1530hrs but when we arrived at 1345hrs, was informed by our staff (the organisers) that the restaurant is in the process of preparing our lunch menu and the 2nd serving will be ready shortly. Unfortunately, the 2nd serving of food is still not enough and many staff did not manage to get anything at all.Since there are so many high-rate reviews for this restaurant based on ala-carte meals, I think it is a good venue for very small groups gathering but definitely not for huge groups of 10s and 20s. Do not go for their buffets, the staff are not yet equipped to handle big groups.Food > Can't comment anything on their food as I did not have the chance to taste anything.Service > The service staff are quite prompt in clearing the drinking cups (plain water) when they saw the seats are empty, so I guess you can said they are attentive.Place > It is located within short walking distance from Orchard Road and you can do people-watching from the outdoor eating area

First, I should mention that the idea and execution of this restaurant is absolutely fabulous. Both in the respects of the incorporation of all members of society in the workforce here and the idea of bringing back a little of what might have been lost when the Rasa Singapura across the road was closed. It does very well in both respects!Understandably, the service was a little slow, but we were the only diners in the restaurant at the time and even then, our food sat atop the counter for a little over five minutes before being brought to the table. Don't get me wrong though, the staff are very friendly and approachable, which made this not much of a problem. Just something to note if you're in a rush or very hungry beyond the ability to wait longer than absolutely necessary!However, that aside, the food was lovely, the concepts ingenious and the presentation very good for its price point. Dining alfresco, with the option to be in the sun or shade, was great too. The dishes are all traditional but most have a bit of a twist - we ended up ordering a few different dishes to share between our party, and all were delicious. Everything was flavoursome, nothing was too spicy and the offerings of table sauces were interesting and complemented the food well. Particularly loved the black pepper char kway teow!We went for the a la carte option, as we were not keen on the 'buffet' option, which only allowed each person to visit the carousel once and fill a plate as full as possible. Not sure this would be appealing unless you have tried most of the items on the menu and know what you like and don't. The price was appealing, but the concept for this not so. Overall, a really, really pleasant meal was had here and we will definitely be returning

Walked here from Orchard Rd based on friends recommendation. Went for lunch - $8 lunch option varies per day. On the day we went it was dry laksa (no soup) which was really good. I ordered pepper char kway teow which was amazing (best so far in Singapore). Friend had hainan chicken which was nice except it was cold which was a bit of a surprise. Good selection of alcohol, good selection of teas. Helpful staff, especially the male manager. Highly recommended

After reading the trip advisor reviews a few of us headed across the road for a local meal. We were not disappointed. Food was full of flavour with a great local menu. Our owner host Jo was outstanding and could not have been more friendly or helpful. She helped us navigate the menu with a great sense of humour. Jo and her husband have a wonderful business founded on social responsibility and it was heartwarming to hear about their generosity and commitment to helping others.

We ended up going three times and were never disappointed. The other reviews which describe it as a chill out airy alfresco dining choice serving very good Singaporean food and reasonably priced cold beer are absolutely accurate. We can recommend the tempura prawns and the Fish Head Curry. The owner was most friendly and service with a smile. Even the night it rained we had a good time there under cover but close to the open and watching the tropical storm. If you are anywhere close you should drop in for either lunch or dinner

Super chill out place that is airy at the alfresco area. Not a stuffy restaurant but a place where you can come as you are and be comfortable dressed up or even in flip flops.It is also incidentally a restaurant that makes it their mission to hire staff that may be disadvantaged or disenfranchised to be able to find work that is meaningful.Dishes that cant go wrong:1.Chicken Wings- lovely prawn paste fried wings that is juicy inside2.Dry Laksa- excellent noodle choice. Dont forget the chilli3.Kambing soup- 3 choices of original, spicy and super spicy, that is out of this world. The broth has a creamy richness with the succulent meat falling off the bones.4. Fried chicken skins! Perfect for those that like to snack with their beer.Affordable drinks and great beer towers.A place to catch up, laugh, eat and be merry without burning a hole in your pocket

We finished up going here twice as we saw things on the menu that we wanted to try on another visit. The food was good and so were the prices and special mention must go to the lovely local beer which was good and cold and cheap
5
Is not easy to find really cold beer in Singapore. At New Rasa is not just very cold, it's cheap (6$!!) and it's for a good cause. Food is pretty good too, local and you can eat a menu on week days for 10$. Staff is very kind and keen to learn. Don't forget the tip!! Is not included.

Very enjoyable meal... nice place to sit and enjoy a beer (or two). Excellent value! Overall a great option

Very good local Singaporean cuisine and good value for money. Service is good and supporting a very good cause. No need to make booking.
5
Excellent local food with a twist without losing its authenticity. I love the kambing soup kway Teow in crazy spicy level. You can always choose milder option. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely return.

Walking back to my hotel after a morning looking at orchids, I wanted somewhere interesting to stop rather than have a hotel lunch and this is just perfect. Ok, the location on the road junction is not the most peaceful or scenic, but I could think of the flowers. For just ten dollars I got a soft drink and a delicious local daily special - chicken char kuay teow the day I visited - served by lovely friendly & efficient staff. Plus whoever was doing the music had great taste (Depeche Mode, the Clash & Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft

I have recently visited New Rasa with a group of 20 friends for a farewell lunch for a colleague. The food is very good and traditional Singapore cuisine.The restaurant hires and supports the needy which only makes the experience better.A very good casual lunch venue with excellent prices and great food

Wanted to show my support for local charity initiatives. Given the cost of eating in any restaurants and that I love the local cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion, quality and very reasonable price of the menu. Drinks were only $4, food betwee $8-$12, service was good, daily lunch specials at reduced price, sharing plates were welcomed. I will definitely do there again over any food court. Portion was hearty and the quality was good in my opinion. Service was good yet there was no service charge. What's more, it's for charity. Plus it is not the hotel price that one has to pay. Will def also bring my foreign guest to this place. Though it was in the outdoor, there were tons of fans everywhere. Plus it's only a short walk across the road is Tanglin Mall. Also a great place to go for those visiting Gleneagles hospital and not wanting to queue in find food court

This is a excellent place to try out local food and support a social enterprise.The Teochew fried beehoon, choice of either with chicken or prawn is very good! Do ask for their sambal chilli to go with it. But have a drink handy. It can be pretty potent - the way locals like it! Service was very good

My family and I stumbled over this gem after pounding the pavement on a hot July day. It is different from many inns in Singapore as you can enjoy the shade of the large trees at the busy intersection of Tanglin and Napier Roads. We tried the laksa, deep fried prawns, and chicken nuggets, with a couple of icy apple ciders. All were perfect. The New Rasa Singapura is the perfect spot for a break in from the midday heat, and the cuisine and drinks cannot be faulted
5
This place is great, sit outside under the fans and enjoy some high quality local specialities at a very reasonable price. Lunch specials are great value at $8 or $10 including a soda. Beers are also reasonably priced, a rare thing in Singapore! Staff are friendly and attentive. A nice alternative from some places along orchard road.

This is an amazing amazing amazing place. Run as a social enterprise to help improve circumstances of a range of people - you get to eat incredible food and do a good deed! The food is not oily, incredibly well spiced and cooked to perfection. The alcohol is limited but good. All at Reasonable prices. This is one place that's just to be discovered. Get there before it is
