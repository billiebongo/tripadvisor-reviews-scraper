This is by far the best pig organ soup which i have ever tasted in the world.
Situated in a cosy corner of tiong bahru market, the stall serves pig organ soup so nice that it begets belief.
a must try.

The soup is the soul of this dish. It is freshly brewed daily from pig bones and mustard vegetables; the soup has the natural tastiness of the bones and a tinge of saltiness from the mustard vegetables. Soup is clear and every spoonful was a delightful taste
