Mr. Vincent is very knowledgable and passionate about tea. We enjoyed the tea (they pour A LOT of tea. Be prepared to drink until you're ready to explode). I'm planning to order their house oolong, Beauty of the East, soon.

Located at the heart of the city centre, I love coming here for dinner (dim sum) and tea as the food is great and it is quite a peaceful and nice place for tea appreciation. Gonna fill my stomach again now!

A great find on Google. I had first visited this place when I first arrived in Singapore and was greeted warmly by Charlene. She was very knowledgeable about the teas and had recommended what to get. This place has a great selection of teas, usually Chinese or Taiwanese. I have tried the pu-erh and it was great. Came back for the oolongs and a black tea, especially brought a friend with me the second tube, and hadn't had a bad tea. It leaves me a great big impression and makes me want to come back

TeaHouse by Yixing Xuan not only provides a wide variety of premium tea leaves, they offer a great environment to enjoy a cup of tea at its best! The staff are knowledgeable and are always ready to offer their help when you are picking your tea. Last of all, if you want to find out more about tea leaves, the teahouse also conducts Tea Appreciation Workshops to help you understand and learn more about teas

What a great experience, if you think you like tea now, wait until you take a workshop here. I went with two colleagues, the workshop and dim sum were amazing. They take the time to explain to you about the different teas: where the come from, what part of the plant is used before you even get into the drinking experience. Then they show you the exact way to make a good cup of tea. They even site articles and studies on the benefits of tea. You can buy items right in the shop. They were very patient with us explaining all the items we bought, wrapped them with care and packed us up.Again if you are a tea lover, yo HAVE to add this to your list of places to visit while in Singapore

No more coffee it was beautiful to learn the art of brewing and I cannot get over the volume of water poured out from a tiny tea pot! Lunch was delicious dim sum too...

I've been here for lunch on many occasions, it being just a short walk from the Raffles Place vicinity. There is a limited selection of dim sum which, at times, can be a little oily, although the prawn dumplings are very good. But the tea after the meal is consistently excellent and always one of the highlights of a visit here

I rang to book onto the Saturday tea tasting and I was told it was a large group and offered the opportunity to go later in the day. This was a tranquil calm delight in amongst the bustle of Chinatown. Vincent , the Tea Master's passion for tea is infectious. We tried white, green , oolong and green with jasmine teas and were taught some history, and how to prepare and serve the tea. Then we were left to sample the teas ourselves with a delight of dimsum. Before we left we spent some time and money in the shop although there was no pressure to buy. A fantastic highlight of our trip and one I will definitely repeat when visiting Singapore again !! Thank you Vincent and family
