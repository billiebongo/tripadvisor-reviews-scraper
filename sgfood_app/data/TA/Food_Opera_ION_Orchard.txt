The bustling orchard road comes with up market restaurants! but here, you can have the reasonable prices meals, which is frequent by locals too!
4
I went to this place for Lunch and enjoyed the food. The location and ambience of this food court is good. There are good food options to choose from. Overall it was a nice lunch and worth visiting while at Orchard Road.
5
You can find all types of cuisine at the food opera. Fresh and tasty food. Healthy juices, coffee and bakery as well. Crispy suckling pig is the best for me. Must try. Great for couples and families as well
4
As Ion at Orchard becomes an icon in Singapore as a brand new mall, it becomes a good meeting point too as it is integrated with MRT.So one night after busy shopping all day, we stopped at Food Opera to have a dinner together. Located in B4, this food court has variety stalls and could satisfy difference tastes of the 6 of us
5
Ate there on my own on a Thursday evening. Arrived at 7 and was immediately seated at a communal high table, which was fine by me (other seating looked comfy - lounge-style). The menu offered SO many terrific choices - at least half a dozen vegetarian burgers, a pages of other options too, including a lovely mix of Singaporean-oriented dishes as well as more Western style. Food was delicious and I ate far more than I intended. The service was friendly and efficient - happy to offer guidance when I was faced with too many great choices. Wish I'd found it earlier in my trip as I'd have eaten as many meals there as I could
3
Very crowd location, dirty flooring and tables; difficult to find a place to seat. Big variety but you need move around ordering and collecting from different stalls... not convenient.Nice to visit once anyway.
4
The Food Opera is a food hall located at the bottom of the ION mall in Orchard Road. It has a variety of food outlets, including one selling Hainanese Chicken. Although it was flavoursome the fact that the chicken was cold was a definite negative for me. Like all food halls it can get very crowded, so timing is something you should take into consideration. Once seated with your food there are ladies that go around with beverage carts, so you can purchase a drink once seated. Enjoy
4
the fish balls were big and bouncy!!the fish dumplings were good too.I had the one w hot soup instead of the dry-mixing type.i prefer the hot soup one without too much sauce which one can taste the fish balls
5
Conveniently located at the basement of ION mall which is connected to Tangs and Shaw House. There are stalls with street food from different countries. Thai food is amazing so is the beef soup noodles. We loved the laksa stall as well. This place caters to a wide range of tastes
3
Stopped by the Thai restaurant at the Food Opera and order some minced chicken basil. It was eatable but nothing else. Crowed place with no space!! Sure there are better options around the area!!
5
Got the handmade noodles, generous portion and value for money.
The chestnut drink was on point too, not to sweet and packed with flavours.
5
This foodcourt is easy to find inside ION Orchard, and as expected it's always busy and packed with people. The salt baked chicken at the Lam's Signatures stall is a must-try, it's packed full of flavor and a great combo with the soft boiled egg
5
Went here a couple of times during our stay in Singapore. The typical sliced prawn noodle with soup is excellent. The fresh springrolls and the dimsum stand is also great. The frest juices they make are good. And to finish of your lunch or dinner you can take a nice tjendol or ice kachang! The prices are quite cheap and the portions are very generous. One the of the best foodcourts of Singapore.Regards from Hollan
4
Went here for breakfast and late supper. Every time it was hustling and bustling with people. As far as shopping mall foodcourt goes, one of the best
4
By far one of the more organised and better food courts in the city. A lot of good Singaporean, Indonesian and Asian cuisine is available. Selection is very good so is the quality Went here 3x during my stay. I’d say it’s much better than the takashimaya food court. If you want to sample Singaporean and Asian cuisine without going to the hawkers come here!
5
The food opera full of stall which sell so many choose of food. You can get a bowl of fish ball around 5sgd. Pretty goodAnd the mall was nice to strolling aroun
4
I forgot the name of the tenant :( but their fish ball is OMG. So Good. price is also affordable (around SGD 6). Others are also looking good too. Most of the prices range SGD 5-7
5
Great massive Food Hall-almost too much choice! Central seating area watched like hawks by lovely ladies, ready to clear away empty dishes.1. KING LOU SEAFOOD: I had a fab soup meal with crayfish, prawns and clams freshly prepared. Very very tasty and only $12. Lovely friendly lady here explained all the dishes. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.2. CHARCOAL MAN: My husband had breaded freshly cooked fish and chips COSTING $8.80-best fish we’ve ever tasted-really succulent and moist. 3. Lovely young man went around selling drinks with fruit in them. I had lychee drink and it was fab-AND there were lychees at the bottom of the cup to eat! Didn’t get the name of the stall, tho I know it’s opposite the KING LOU SEAFOOD one mentioned above.NOTE: I couldn’t understand there were no serviettes, until I saw a basin where you wash and dry your hands after eating! What a saving on paper, not using serviettes...other places should follow suit!!Do enjoy your meal as much as we did. we noticed many many locals eating there-always a good sign!!All the eateries should be listed separately on TripAdvisor
5
Brilliant options with authentic flavours compared to NZ. Clean and friendly staff. Much better value for food compared to other hawker stalls. Slightly lacking in outside atmosphere but air conditioning great after long day in sun
4
We are here one evening and had a great meal. There's a large variety of different cuisines- all at very reasonable prices. Portion sizes are good. There is a good atmosphere when eating here, but still managed to easily find a table. We would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to give hawker style food a go, eating on a budget or to experience local cuisines.
5
A great place to eat in between shopping. Wide variety of different foods and they all look delicious!
4
For affordable and good food you can drop by here. The place is well decorated and ventilated. Prices are from $5-10 per dish. Try to avoid the peak lunch and dinner time where finding an empty seat can be a challenge.
4
ION is a massive mall on Orchard road. It caters for high end shoppers as well as discounted stores in the basement levels. The Food Opera located quite centrally in the mall caters for a wide variety of tastes. It's always crowded, but if you don't mind the people, the food and pricing is well worth the trip. Those looking for halaal options, try the Indonesian cuisine stall. There are also many sweet options on offering
4
If you have not enough knowledge of Asian cuisines, then you can not choose your desirable food among all those many choices because there is no enough information provided about the ingredients and taste
5
Higly recommended. Variety of food, reasonable price and super clean environmen.It is a great place for budget travellers and a family with big appetite. It is conveniently located in the ION on popular Orchard Street
4
You can eat a good lunch for $10.00 or less. Plenty of choice. I had the Indonesia which was great. Seating hard to find st times as very popular in the heart of Orchard R
5
this place is great to eat and a lot of food are mostly Singapore or Malay food but the foods taste good, the price is pricey. And I don't think so its easy to find space or table to eat because so crowded here
4
Food Opera is a whole bunch of hawker stalls in one section in the ION food court on level B4. Most people order at the counter, but dim sum carts do come round, as does a drinks cart. You have to fight for a table as Food Opera is popular and seriously busy, so its best if one of you finds a table while the other is getting food. You can always go back for more dishes. Good dim sum at reasonable prices and the BBQ Pork Buns were fantastic as were the Prawn Dumplings. Serves cold beer - so all good
5
Been there for 3 times during this trip and enjoyed the crowd. Delicious dimsum and hainan chicken rice. Forgot to zap some to be posted here though..
4
Right on the MRT Orchard Metro station is the huge ION shopping mall. Also a 5' walk from the big hotels. Dining can be expensive in Singapore and if you just want Quick Asian cuisine on a budget, this place is great, with a huge variety. $S12 gets you a set meal and you can get a cold Beer for $S5. I go to this court every time I stay on Orchard. It does get a bit crowded at peak times but as the turnover is fast, you can find a place to sit pretty quick. The only down side is there are no knives whatever you choose as is the Asian way, so if you want on-the-bone bring your own knife...
3
You can find all kind of street food here. I really really loved it. The only reason why Im giving it 3 stars is because I have diarreah every single time coming here.
5
Another choice of food court style eatery on orchard road. It does have a good selection of food. This or the Takashimaya food court are my choices of food courts whenever i'm on orchard.
5
Great food court with the variety of food and drink, cheap, clean, good services. This place located in the orchard road and near the MRT. Perfect
5
As you know Singapore is a multicultural country, so there are many ethnics and culture in Singapore. In Food Opera you can find many choice to try Singapore's local food from any ethnics and culture.
5
This food court is in a great location at the basement of ION Orchard. It essentially is a hawker centre with air-conditioning (and higher prices). But the food sure is delicious and there are options for everyone.
5
This is the best chicken dish I ve tasted in Singapore and a trip to Singapore is not complete without visiting Lam s at the Ion s Food Opera. They serve abalone noodles too and I must say it s delicious. Their chicken is super tasty , soft to the bone and so moist. Delicious
3
The place is nice & the food is good. A bit overcrowded but the worst part is the prices compared to other food courts.
1
Try the Jumbo Prawn soup noodle is tasteless below average n only 1 big prawn cut into half....Really need to make big improvement on soup n prawn quality overcooked...:
4
Well this place is clean, plenty of good & tasty food and drinks here. The price are a little bit higher since they were inside a mall. We came at arround 11.30am we have to wait arround 10 minutes to get a table. Plenty of tourists still sit and chattering after they finished eating, and ignorant with other people waiting to get a table for lunch
5
I never like fish ball soup until I tried the one here. A friendly couple from next table told us that their is the best in Singapore. Always come back for more.The best white carrot cake in town is here also. Don't forget to get the hakaw from the circulating dimsum cart here
3
Very crowd location, dirty flooring and tables; I could expect more considering located on ION?? Much better options just near ..
5
we always go to ION to go to the opera food court, where you get the best PEPPER BEEF STIR FRY from Scotts Hwa Heng Beef noodles.
I never fails it is so good enjoy, we will be back again in july.
4
Stopped by here for a quick lunch, and decided to opt for the Fried Prawn Noodles - very competatively priced at S$5.80 each. Good size portions, and very tasty - recommended.
4
Must try fishball noodles & soup. I'd recommend dried noodles & fishball soup. Fishcake is also delicious. Great foods & affordable price!
4
They have many option for the food,start from cheap food to expensive food,from street snacks to restaurant meal with a good price.my favorite place for eating
4
Went here for a quick dinner, and this hawker style food court didn't disappoint.We ate at Lam's signature and i highly recommend their salt baked chicken thigh with rice and their spinach meatball soup with noodles. Delicious and reasonably priced. We also tried smoked duck at another food stall, delicious but a bit pricey.Drinks are sold at the center, as in all other food republic
5
Right in the heart of Singapore all the favourite hawker food is here in a very nice setting on B4 of the ION. Whether it is one of the many different Chinese cuisines, Indonesian, Indian, Malay or Western, there's something delicious for everyone. Tables are kept clear and clean and prices are good. One of our favourites is the melt in your mouth Hainanese Chicken Rice stand.
4
Food Court, located in the basement of Burberry and Prada boutiques, like no one else in Singapore. The interiors look as if they create Philippe Starck (baroque chandeliers, velvet sofas, black lacquered panels at the walls), but the food is simple. In B4-03 pavilion try soup curry laksa - spicy soup with noodles
4
My favourite place for Hainanese Chicken rice. But today they ran out and I tried something else at Lams signature " salt baked chicken thigh rice". Something to die for!! All is well that ends well and as you can see I destroyed the dish and midway I realised I need to show more respect to a fabulous meal.
3
Compare the price from hawkers, this is a little higher but of course, this place is more comfortable and clean. The only problem we encountered is that employee that take away the plates, they buss the table so quick. More choices of food stalls inside and outside the Opera
5
This food court is a delight of different street food options. Have been there multiple times and the food never disappoints. The only problem is finding seating as the place is always rightfully jammed.
4
Clean and great variety of local hawker style food options. Very authentic and different ethnic cuisines. Crowded at times. Must be willing to share tables. Great to people watch.
5
We stopped for a quick lunch during a shopping trip at the Food Opera at ION and were really surprised at the options that were available. Food tasted great and was good value for money. You do get authentic Singaporean cuisine including the famous chicken rice. During lunch the seating gets a bit tight but if you are willing to share a table this place is definitely worth a visit.
5
Very high level of cleanliness. Variety of choices is great. Had some Chinese, prawn noodles, Thai food and murtabak for dinner. Kaya toast, dim-sum, fritters and congee for breakfast. Prices are slightly more than compared to other food markets, but not too much. Hard pressed to find seating though
5
We have been at Food opera now several times and enjoy the selection of various types of food. Especially the Bak Kut Teh place, the one selling chicken wings, Laksa and sizzling beef are great. Always like the buzzing atmosphere and fun environment. This is a great place to stop for lunch when one is tired of shopping
2
I went to Food Opera to have my all time fav li xin dry fishball noodles on 7 nov 2016 alone. The type of noodles that i like is called "mee kia" which is thin noodles. I always order dry mee kia whenever i come to eat there. So yesterday a lady who took my order printed my receipt that i ordered mee kia. But the uncle who served it gave me the different kind of noodles. He gave me chor mee, which is flat noodles. I said to him that i ordered mee kia, not chor mee. Then he switched my bowl with another plain mee kia without any sauce. I was confused why he did that because I ordered dry mee kia with fishball soup. He discussed with his colleagues for a while then he said "You order dry noodles right? Then this is your order." He still gave me the chor mee after seeing my receipt clearly stated "mee kia". Finally I walked away taking my fishball noodles, with the wrong order that they do not want to be responsible with. I thought well.. it was just noodles so i did not want to argue with the uncle. But seeing the uncle treated me like that, maybe he thought that i am a tourist so he nonchalantly gave me that kind of service. I will think twice to have my meal there
3
Enjoyed Indian food in this mainly Asian food court in the Ion mall. While it is all quite fresh, it is good but nothing spectacular. Each "stall" serves a specific type of Asian cuisine. A little annoying is that the vendors do not supply napkins! And you need to go to a specific stall to buy a beverage. not very user friendly, but definitely cheap for Singapore
4
With new renovation site, dining here is more comfortable. Brings up cleaner feeling too. We love the rojak, dimsum, and all selections. Sadly the ice cen-teng serves less shredded ice. To add little more of shredded ice, they all 0.60C Additional on top of the $3.20 price
5
This is a particular favourite of my wife when we are in Singapore. While I like my hawker food surrounds a little more gritty and ageing, Food Opera in Ion is a wonderful choice for those who want to try the local hawker/street cusine in a modern air conditioned and comfortable environment. There's a great array of foods including seafood, roasted and BBQ meats, noodles, vegetarian options, dumplings, traditional Kopi and the outrageous combinations of the shaved ice style desserts. Easy to get to and a great place to escape the heat and enjoy classic Singaporean dishes in style. Yes it will cost you a little more than the older more traditional hawker centres however there is definately a higher comfort level at Food Opera which is certainly worth the few extra dollars per plate for those who prefer modern facilities
5
After renovation, the food hall is now smaller but the food choices remains great. As it is located in Orchard, tourists can easily access this place. It is just right beside Orchard MRT. Expect a lot of people during lunch and dinner. But there are a lot of seats available. This is a very good place to eat different local dishes at one place
4
We enjoy visiting Food Opera @ Ion - the food choices are very good and the eating area is spotless. Most often we eat Indian when we visit as their Phrata is superb, but one is really spoilt for choice here.
4
Although windowless, this is a lovely food court. It's beautifully designed, has tons of great food and is very reasonable, considering the location. Would definitely recommend for newbies nervous about outdoor hawker centres.
4
This is a food hall that has an excellent range of food. You can spend a week here and still not sample the varieties of food available. It is crowded at all times. But you can always find a table or share a table. It has a nice atmosphere and great food at really low prices
5
Food Opera re-opened after renovation. There are now some new stalls. For tourist who wants to savour local food in Orchard, this is one of the food courts to go to, although prices are a bit higher. Quite a wide variety of food to try. I tried the dry Lam's abalone noodle. Next visit, I'll probably try out Prata King's Indian food.
5
This is an air conditioned interior version of the world famous Singapore hawker food stalls, with the convenience of being in the center of Singapore's upscale shipping center. An extensive selection of Asian cuisines, as well as European and American. One can eat all three daily meals here for a week at a different shop each time. Must be experienced to on every trip to Singapore
5
This is one of my favourite food court. Good choices and taste good. Every time when we are in Singapore we are sure to visit this food court t least once. I love the Hong Kong style duck noodles dry, the fried butterfly dough and dough stick are also our favourite.Chicken rice too. So lots to eat
4
Came here for lunch while staying in a hotel off Orchard Road. A really good selection of different food types with surprisingly tasty food. Not cheap, but presumably that's partly related to the overheads associated with the mall. We had Char Siew and Wan Ton Mee, both very good. Drinks were pretty decent too. Overall quite a good place for a meal on Orchard Road, and good value compared to the majority of restaurants in the vicinity. Would go back
4
The Food Opera is located at the basement of ION Orchard mall. There are different kind of food like Thai food, Seafood noodle, Indonesian food, Chicken Rice and other local Singaporean food. Food prices are not too high and the food court is clean and spacious. We have ordered chicken rice and noodle and both tasted delicious
4
Always full. But no wonder, because food there was excellent. You could pick from various asian cuisine there. I tasted Thai food ( really VERY spicy) and Japanese cuisine.You could buy drink on few places there or there were employees with a cart full of different kinds of drink. It is perfect place to eat for good price. Highly recommend
4
Ate here swveral times during my recent visit to Singapore. Located in the Ion Orchard mall Food opera has many choices for Asian cuisine of all types. I primarily settled for the beef noodle soup which was tasty. Should have tried more, but the beef noodle soup kept me coming back again & again
4
We went here quite a few times being close to hotel. Cheap, delicious food. Just what you want to keep family holiday expenses down
4
Stopped into the food court. Overwhelmed with the number of places. Settled on Let's Eat.
Had Penang fried oyster and Penang prawn noodle.
Great and helpful service. Food was surprisingly good for the price.
Recommended
5
Clean, fresh air & great atmosphere. Food abundance & very friendly local food stalls. Each stalls look good enough to tuck in. After a sumptuous meal just stroll out along Orchard road to digest your food... Don't need to drive and get stuck in traffic or hefty parking charges. Best way to enjoy your Saturday...
5
I have been to this food court so.many times and I enjoy it every single time. There is just so much variety. You can eat just about anything that suits your mood. I love having the duck rice/ roast pork rice and a bowl of steaming hot watercrest soup. Sometimes I have the Hokkien Mee. Sometimes I have the Bah Kuh Teh. I have tried the Malay and Indian food as well and they were also good
4
Really good variety of stalls. Grab a table first, put something down to hold your spot, and then do you walk about and decide on what you want to eat. Singaporeans usually put down their tissues to hold a spot, and everyone seems to follow this. I had the chicken rice a number of times (yummy) and also the Yong Tau Foo (also very yummy). Very inexpensive
3
This big foodcourt is part of Ion Food Hall on level B4. No doubt that this is a very huge & very nice food court for good local cuisines. But the prices here are on the very high side, maybe the most expensive in this city for a foodcourt. Definitely one can get similar just as good, or even better food at many other similar foodcourts in Orchard area malls
5
There is a huge variety of hawkers serving all kinds of gourmet food. There was even an indian vendor serving biryani. However we opted for the double bratwurst with hash brown from the pepper lunch express outlet and Chicken rice from sergeant hainanese vendor. The bratwurst was excellent. Tasty and succulent and priced at S$ 8.20 , it was a steal. The chicken rice was above average priced at 7.60.A hearty and tasty lunch while shopping at orchard
5
We went here twice during our stay, as the dishes are authentic and full of locals. There was a real buzz which made it more exciting that it was all under one roof and close to where we were staying. Rather than a tourist option, I wanted Singapore delights, and I wasn't disappointed. Go by the pictures they have, if you don't know what to order, as a lot of the servers didn't speak very good English. Most dishes were prepared fresh and were delicious. So many cuisines to choose from, you almost need to go more than once! Or if you are with others, get some different dishes and share, so that you can experience more. Excellent value for money
4
The food court buzz is at a all time high during lunch and dinner.Try and sneak in early and you will find a wide array of Asian cuisine- fresh juices, chinese snacks, Thai cuisine, Indian spicy food, Taiwanese fish ball, the famous Malaysian popiah and satay. And don't forget some of the best roasts from the chinese kitchen. My votes goes to the Taiwan fish balls, chinese snacks,Malaysian popiah and also Chinese roast
4
The heart of Singapore shopping would have to be around Orchard Rd/Scotts Rd so it was great to stumble on the basement Food Opera in ION Orchard as lunch time was beckoning. The range of food on offer was extensive, the prices reasonable for the location and the quality good. Unfortunately, the Malaysian hawker was closed so the taste for Char Kway Teow had to be satisfied otherwise; but, the choice was extensive. In summary, if you hanker for genuine, reasonably priced Asian hawker food then you can't go past the Food Opera
5
There is so much variety of food here. You can definitely experience so many different cuisines; Indian, Indonesian, Chinese, Singaporean etc..
You have to visit if you are looking for a great meal!
5
The food opera is the best place to savor all of the best hawker dishes in Singapore. They gathered and chose the best hawkers to open up their stalls at the opera. I can eat here any day.
5
Great food experience here! We dined several times during our stay, lots of choice and such fresh produce made this a "go to" place for us in Singaore CBD
5
Fishball soup is the best I can find in Singapore! Love the taste of the soup so much and the texture of the Fishball is so fine! The fish cake is very nice too! Thumbs up!
4
Plenty of choices to those from. Ordered the Fried Kway Teow and it was as good as you would find in Malaysia or anyplace. Also had the Indonesia BBQ usually have it always enjoy it. Look forward to my next time here.
5
Everything here is pretty good. The managers obviously tried hard to get the best talent available. Especially recommend the Indonesian food and the prawn laksa
5
We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and came across Food Opera while having a walk around the shopping centre. There are lots of different cuisines and prices are very reasonable and servings are generous. We had lunch or dinner several times at Food Opera and never got bored
5
My family and I have spent the last two trips to Singapore exploring this food court. We were used to others and this time decided to spend more time to get to know this one. The food court at ION is huge and the options for dining-in restaurants are many. So this place is a food lovers paradise. There are so many different types of food available and so many kiosks to choose from. One can spend a few months just dining here and still not explore it entirely. And everything I have tried out so far is amazing. I would recommend walking around the Basement (B4) first and then choosing. Do not go in their super hugry and sit or choose the very first place you see. It is imperative that you first walk around and see all your options and then pick and choose where and how you want to fix your tray up.And also leave room for desert. The food court has a lot of options and just like with the mains, walk around and look at the options first and then choose. If you are in Singapore and want to shop till you drop and then eat till you cant walk anymore, ION Orchard is the place for you and your family!
5
We love the selections there. As someone who visits singapore it is not easy to find takutkan food in tourist area, this pave has it!! ROJAK singapore. Love it! ! Next best is Teo Chew noodle, chicken wings. And ice Cen Theng is a must! !
4
On our 1st night we went for a walk in the ion centre and found this excellent Chinese cafe. Food was very good as was the attentive service. This was also very good value for money. There are many restaurant to choose from so it should suit all tastes. Thanks team for a good meal
3
After walking around for many hours, this place is good enough for sitting down and relaxing my foots.
I try one of stall selling oysters omelet which quite nice in texture and flavor. Longan juice was also nice not too sweet.
3
Not the best place to eat in a food court as some them are not that good and also expensive which is not worth it.
Fruit juices/shakes are quite expensive here so I recommend you drink somewhere else.
3
Most food looks enticing and promising. But unfortunately never judge the food by its look. Bak chor mee was not bad. Vietnamese beef noodle was really a bad purchase. But will still patronize this food court and try other food stalls.
4
Bustling,busy atmosphere with a large choice of Asian food. Hard to make a choice but don't go past the Hainese Chicken Rice.
4
Most food here are more pricey due to their location in Ion, so make sure u spend your $ on something that's delicious and worthwhile! The homemade noodles are soft yet springy and their soup is richly flavoured from its ingredients. Portions are big too.
4
Food and drinks here are generally overpriced due to their location but some stalls are good and reasonably priced. The ban mian here is good with a rich broth. The goreng pisangs at adjacent stall are very fresh, huge and crispy.
4
A very busy and crowded food court. It was quite difficult for us to find seats. The variety of was good while not as great as I expected based on other reviews. I picked roast duck with rice, which cost me $10 for a medium portion. Quite tasty and recommended for taste, but a little bit pricey to me. Well... this food court is located at the central of Singapore on one of the busiest mall though, you cannot compare the price of the food with similar food at other location
5
This is like a food court consisting of top quality food from just about every Asian variety, plus Indian and Indonesian. When I planned my trip to Singapore I expected to eat a lot of top restaurants. My wife and I were hungry and did a little shopping near the hotel and decided to eat there. We've been back twice. Unreal
5
We eat here quite often when we visit Singapore at Christmas time every year. The variety is awesome, pretty much anything you want, you can have. My fav is the fish ball noodle stall. My husband tends to choose the salad and wrap stall. My kids like the Padang Padang stall where you can get rice and veges plus egg. Everything is reasonably priced ($5.50 for my fish ball noodle which is about US$4) and there is a lot of seating which I can't say the same for other food courts around the area
3
An elaborately designed food court, but it's still a food court so don't get too excited about the quality . The food in general is ok for a super casual lunch, and they have some unusual stalls that most food courts don't have like local fried fritters which we don't see much of anymore
5
We had more food than we could eat and all for a very cheap price. It can be crowded and hard to find a seat but worth the wait. I can recommend the oyster omelet and the pork and rice.
4
Although it's constantly as busy as all the other rather sanitised versions of Hawker Centres, Food Opera's selection offered a really good choice for both of us, which is not always the case, as my Wife can't stand Chilli!
4
Wellll 9 out of 10 times here I will have the Indonesian BBQ.... I've had this dish many many times and always always enjoy it. Look forward to my next meal in.
4
The price is reasonable for a place to eat at Orchard. :) If you want to eat but want to avoid the hot hot hot weather of Singapore and the expensive restaurants around the area, this is the place to go.
WIFI is also available!!!
4
Mind boggling selection. Everything I've tried there was at least good. Good prices, considering the location.
The more outlying hawker centres provide better taste and quality for your SG$.
3
Typical fake hawker centre Cashing in on the tourist dollar. Some ok food, really not bad bit just overpriced for the quality you get. A few vendors have won "awards" but I guess they paid their way in.
4
Popular place with a variety of different cuisine .Very clean and no cheats. Real pleasure at affordable prices.
4
This is a great place to try the dozens of specialties of Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian and other influences that make up Singapore's amazing cuisine. At mid-day, this food court is very crowded, and table space is at a premium, so you might want to walk around and figure out what you want, then find a table, leave one of your party to guard it, and then get your food. The selections are seemingly endless, and we found them all good. The prices are certainly fair. Feel free to mix and match to sample a lot of different tastes.Hope this helps you to enjoy the ION Food Opera
2
Ordered from the satay stall & there was a stick which was badly burnt. Asked the China stall hawker to change that stick he cut out the burnt parts & showed a black face. Service terrible.Today is crowded on a sun lunch. We managed to get a seat at the back of the bench area which is near to the food waste collection. Table cleaners left the whole row of to be cleared trays in front of us (see attached photos of food waste trays in front of our meal) , who are consuming our food at the moment. The reason from one of the chinese old aunty who tied a bun is that sun is a crowded day, no choice have to place here. Another cleaner wants to clear the food waste in front of us eating. Imagine the possible of people's food waste splashing into our food. She gets told off by us. The stall management should as well corner off this whole table for tray clearing by the cleaners.Food range, can be easily get from other locations in Singapore

Would always visit this foodcourt when in Singapore. It is relatively spacious and offers more seating than other foodcourts around the area. My all-time favorites include the Niang Tofu (Hakka version of stuffed tofu/dumplings), Singaporean dessert station, fresh juice concoctions, oil fritters, Indonesian etc. The place is typically crowded so I get there during off-peak hours to find a good seat. Above-average fast food quality. Wide selection of food choices. Clean. My favorite foodcourt in Singapore. Would recommend

Wow - the food here is great we ate here twice in 2 days !! Everything so fresh and tasty. Try the Chicken Rice or the Indonesian stall - yum !
3
Very crowded, average food. Chicken rice was cold and not very tasty. Overall, disappointing and I would not bother again
4
It is advisable to find a seat first before you head out to order your food because the place is always packed. The decoration is nice you get even transparent chairs (hopefully will not break).
3
Quite a variety of rice and noodles. Ordered a pork ball noodles and fried fish soup noodles. Both tastes average. Price range sgd 6-12 for a stumptous meal.
4
This is a convenient located food court with a good selection of local eats. Had the fishball noodles which were the one of the best I've had!! Recommend for anyone passing by for a quick bite.

Although it's located in ion mall, the food is quite average...and relatively expensive
Not my favourite place to eat..the food court at wisma atria is better
5
a lovely selection of local and international specialties to suit each and every budget..... another must visit if your hungry in the Orchard Road area.....

Lots of locals eating here means that it is good. A lot of variety, very cheap and easy to access from the shopping centre or MRT station.
Good value for money and very clean, would recommend to anyone.

This is the Food Court at the Ion Orchard Road shopping centre. We always like to eat where the locals eat so this food court can be busy. Good selection bur prices a little bit higher than other food courts, still the food is authentic and very tasty

We only had lunch at one place here - a Vietnamese stall. We ordered the Beef Pho and the chicken set lunch. The chicken set came with a cold tamarind drink - which was surprisingly nice and the total cost for lunch was just under $15.00. We sat next to a couple of locals who explained some of the food to us and how hot the chilli was and this was a highlight. The food was good and the ladies we shared the table with were great. Ion is a good place to escape from the heat

This is a true delight for the senses. Go for lunch before the crowds start swimming, There are so many choices you might want to wear loose pants. We had beef noodles and they were delicious.

Revisited the good hall on my recent visit to Singapore
The place was packed with both locals and visitors
The assortment of food to eat is vast and what we ate was very tasty and reasonable
4
Good food choices ranging from, Chinese, Singaporean,, Indonesian, Vietnamese and much more.
cheap and ambiance feels like you're not eating at a food court!
5
Wide range of food, very cheap and very good hygiene standards went here many times during my trips to
Singapore tasty food

Attended Food Opera whilst staying in Singapore for dinner. Had a great feed of rice, noodles and oyster omelet. Good atmosphere and well frequented by the locals which is always a good sign. Something there for everyone, all made fresh in front of you.Highly recommended

How can you go wrong? Fresh made na'an stuffed full of cheese and then baked in the traditional oven right before your very eyes ... handed over ... steaming hot, covered with butter and served with a dish of butter chicken sauce for dipping and all for $3.80 Singapore dollars! I found foodie heaven! I believe the stall is called "Taste of India" ... it is tucked back in the corner of the Food Opera food court section of ION at Orchard. You must find it ... trust me! Then go buy bigger pants! :

This review and rating is exclusively for Padang Padang. Taste is good in general but it is over priced for its quantity. Fried fish and fried chicken of Nasi Lemak Set are small and the a-la-carte chicken they put on my plate was also so little that I felt stupid paying S$3.5 for. I tried a few dishes in the past and never happy with cost performance. I will never buy from them again

The Food Opera @ Ion Orchard offers a good variety of Asian food at very reasonable prices. We visited twice as the food was very good value and importantly tasted delicious. We enjoyed chicken rice at $5 per plate, 3 steamer baskets of dim sum for $13.50 and roast duck for $9. Highly recommend for a quick, cheap meal in Singapore

Food Opera @ ION Orchard is a great place to dine. It has a wide selection of food from Thai, japanese, Vietnamese, western and local cuisine. You will be spoilt with so many choices and the prices are reasonable. Great place to bring your friends from overseas to try out the variety of food in air con comfort. However, it may be very crowded in the weekends
5
Ion Orchard Food Opera was new, nice, with plenty of choice. We tried some fish bee hoon, minced pork noodle, chicken rice and bbq and roast pork with rice. They were all very yummy and fresh. We also tried some fried stingray from the 'Ah Wink?' seafood, which was also very tasty. Price wise, a bit higher than hawkers but in return you have air con, clean, nice, comfy environment in the middle of the city to enjoy.Come and try them, very nice, refine place and cheap compare to some of our foodcourts over here
4
For a taste of singapore cuisine without the sweat, I would recommend the food court. Gets really busy during meal times, I d suggest going for an early lunch to get a seat and table.
4
A great selection of stalls here, with a reasonable chance at a table. We tried the chicken rice, oyster omelette, fried carrot cake, and noodles (not all at once), and enjoyed every bit of it. Prices are reasonable.
5
Good range of local foods in a clean air-conditioned setting. Good cleaning up service too. I saw many people's plates cleared as soon as they finished up or got up.
4
If you like Asian food, you'll love this place! Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Malay and Singapore food stalls, spotlessly clean, multiple entree choices, all reasonably priced.
5
It's tough to order things that look different, spell different, and are things you can't pronounce. Not to mention that you don't even know what to ask for. This place solves all that in one shot.LOTS and lots of restaurants are all packed into this upper end giant Malls food court. This is NOT like a typical U.S. mall food court. Just walking around from cooking to cooking takes you through Singapore, Indonesia, China, Viet Nam, and a bunch of other offshoots of food in those countries. We just walked around and watched the pictures, asked the locals "what's that?"...and ordered things one plate at a time. Roughly $5 a plate. We did 4 and were stuffed. And we knocked off 4 of the 'must eat' plates of food that you should try while in Singapore. They were to die for. Seriously.One last thing. Walking through this mall, and of course the city too, and you immediately know that its true that Singaporeans are obsessed with great food. And the food is spectacular tasting
4
This place is great. Wide variety of Singapore's finest hawker food. If you go there during regular eating times, then be prepared to hunt (and wait) for a table. A testament to the quality and selection available I suppose. The Teo Chew Minced Pork Noodles (also known as Bak Chor Mee) are amazing. Enjoy
3
Variety is the hall of choice about food courts. Almost all dishes below 10 $ near Orchard Road. Almost all local Asian stalls like Singaporean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai etc available . Place is kept neat and tidy with free cleaning. A budget food joint no doubt.
5
I love Ion Food Opera and eat there always when in Singapore....great food at great prices in a spotless environment right in the heart of Orchard Rd. Most meals are well under 10.00 (SD) and re generous in the serving,,,I have my favourite stalls that are consistently great whether for lunch or dinner....Laska stall and the Fish ball Stall next to it...Padang Padang and Chicken Rice Stall..But an be impossible to get a table between 12 and 1.30 and from 6.30pm so maybe plan to go outside f these times..plenty of shopping around you to keep you busy for a bit longer
4
This was probably the best food court we visited in Singapore. A wide selection of all types of street food and other in a clean air con environment. My favourite here was the Yong Tau Foo a really healthy selection of vegetables and about 50 types of tofu, stuffed fried etc. The BBq and roasted meat stall was pretty good too. All cheap as well roughly $5 for most things
5
Low cost lunch and great food selections. Just like so many of the food courts in Singapore and along Orchard Road, every kind of Asian food on offer from the myriad stalls and all delicious AND CHEAP. My chicken biryani set meal cost S$4. Unbeatable value
4
It's always busy here. Love the food variety, the taste never changed at all. That's why we always came back to eat here. The location near our hotel too.
4
Nice place, clean, lots of choice but more expensive than other similar establishments. I had the singapore chicken rice, medium roast chicken set, paid $9, very tasty and portion was good, felt full for the whole day.

went at 920am. go to drink stall to buy coffee. but staffs busy eating breakfast and having coffee. rudely tell me "NOT READY"
4
Great food, clean, nice stall and a lot of choice of food. It just feel nice to eat there. Although it was crowded when lunch, but it was great!
3
The place is very crowded in lunch n dinner time. Very hard to find empty seat. Many stall inside the food opera but also many food counter outside the food opera itself. You should go around first before chosse the food you interest.
5
Huge , huge selection of food in over the top portions. Fast, affordable and all of it delicious. Just don't come with big groups, because seating is impossibly crowded.
3
We went there about 8p on a Monday. Lots of people. ... but we thought much of the food was tired, cold, and unappealing. It's probably better when it is freshly cooked. We had the Indonesian chicken and fish set $8, the Penang seafood and two veg $6, and two beers $15! Surprised that beer cost more than food. Lots of dessert places, but a taste or two of the Gelato and we moved on toward Orchard Rd

The food here is not cheap, some items can cost up to double the price of hawker stalls in less central areas . However it is still affordable in dollar terms. It is in a convenient location and can be reached easily after shopping in ION. It is nicely air conditioned, but always crowded when I visited. I normally eat the Bak Chor Mee. I've tried quite a few in Singapore, and the Bak Chor Mee here was surprisingly one of the best. Prices range from SGD 5-7 per bowl if memory serves. The dish consists of dry noodles with minced pork, pork liver, bits of pork crackling, vinegar and chilies - sounds simple but trust me it is good
4
Prices at the hawker stalls here are higher, but quality is also much better, and there is a very wide selection. Among my favorite stalls are: yong tau fu, roasted meat (go for the combo for sharing), minced pork dry noodles, indonesian BBQ chicken/fish, youtiao. As if this is not enough, in adjoining areas are also some very good food sellers - bak kut teh, tori-q, et

ION Orchard is a one hip and crowded place. Food Opera is a big food court complex but the crowds make it feel small. This place could go twice the size and still not be big enough. Food choices wide ranging and invite you to try the lot. Loved it but sadly everyone else does as well. Worth a try. For people watchers this is the place to be
