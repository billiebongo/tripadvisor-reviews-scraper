A group of 6 had dinner on a Sat night, taking the second seating. We found the restaurant to be unique as it resembles an aeroplane. The wait staff's outfit resembled air stewardess's, the windows were exactly like the ones on the plane, the chairs as well! We had ordered the Omakase in advance...and that meant each dish was a surprise as it was the chef's selection. It was no doubt the highest quality, freshest, most beautifully presented dishes that I had for the price we paid!We had 1) fresh clam and scallop 2) slices of shashimi tuna belly 3) little crunchy crabs 4) melt in your mouth pork 5) grilled lobster 6) soup 7) fried rice with beef 8) fruit! The chef grinded some fresh wasabi to go with our meal... And we topped the meal with sake.What an exquisite sensational experience! Tingling to the senses!!The service was top notch! I applaud the restaurant for giving an older wait staff an opportunity to work - the waitress was friendly, topped up my green tea regularly and gave us more wet napkins when she saw we had used up ours.The chef came to our table and explained the dishes we were having and that made the meal more interesting!I am definitely planning my next visit and cannot wait for the surprise dishes in another Omakase meal

I was impress by how much the commit to the decoration and the theme of being an airline. It makes for a fun setting and overall the sushi is quite good.I would recommend it for a night out
3
Came here recently for lunch with some colleagues and opted for the Chirashi lunch set. This was quite tasty but a little small for me - ended up still hungry afterwards. A little bigger would be better. Service was efficient if lacking a little in warmth. Interesting concept and layout. Not very big so might be a bit tough to get a seat here at night

This was my 3rd visit to Sushi Airways. It is located on the 2nd floor of the row of shophouses along Baghdad Street. The street is lined with eateries.Overall, the quality of sushi and sashimi was good on all of my 3 visits. The fish is fresh as they have 3 batches of fish air flown in direct from JAPAN. The Chef however was not trained in cutting OTORO (red tuna belly), as the angle of cut present the fish with a lot of veins.The other dishes which I enjoyed include the NZ Fresh Oysters, tiny deep fried crabs and the Aburi Hotate with mentai sauce.I would not recommend the Kurobuta Katsu though. The meat is not fresh and have the frozen taste. You can’t really blame the restaurant though. Their speciality is in fish.If you are a tourist strolling along the touristic Arab Street, and has a crave for Japanese food, this place is worth a visit

We been here many times but this is the first time we're so deeply impressed. Special thanks to Chef Zi Long 子龙 for whipping up such sumptuous dinner. Awesome service, excellent food & presentation. Thumbs up!

Brought my business associates for lunch. Ootoro ($49++) was chewy and like breaking into pieces not the normal slice type. Anyway was quick lunch so didn't feedback though sub standard. The thing that piss me was during payment the credit card machine broke down. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. Claim not their problem and ask me to call the bank on their behalf. I was like what the... Who is working here? Me?The staff was the old aunty that wore spectacles. Not a single apology and not her fault attitude. My last visit to this place. I hope it run out of business soon. Good riddance

The service was poor despite the place being small ( whatever shown on picture in website , that's all the size ) and turnaround for 'flight attendant' to get to you was longer than a budget airline. Slots of hours are given only 1.5 hours to dine but 20mins were gone waiting and being attended ( patron coming in after us were served first ) Hope this review will be taken for the betterment of the place soon
1
We had a reservation,when we arrive there were no tables available. When we finally got our table, the waitress decided to attend the other 2 tables that came after us! We waited at least a good 20mins.... on TOP of all that, apparently setting the empty tables were more important then taking our orders. Walked out on them! Not worth even trying the food (which could be, but I will never find out... 
1
We reserved for 8am but not only got our tables later, we were made to wait as they served 2 other tables that came after us. With the waitress no where in sight, we walked off 22 mins later

Sushi Airways is pretty unique which offers an opportunity to enjoy good Japanese food in an airline atmosphere. Staff are dressed as cabin attendants. Good for a quiet and simple lunch. Place isn't very big but good enough for a quick meal.

Came here at noon on a Sunday. Nobody so nice and quiet. :D we ordered yummy wagyu beef yakiniku lunch set at $16 and chirashi don at $17. Comes with miso soup, salad and retty decent matcha ice cream.
5
Here again for my fresh live Uni - Sushi Airways never fail to deliver!
Do order their sashimi set and my fav rolls are: ebi maki roll and Mango Lobster roll!!!
5
Food - The sashimi here is really fresh, with nice and seasonal selections too. My go-to is the Bara Chiraishi Set. Never fails to amaze :)Ambience - What I particularly like about this place is the airline theme they adopt! The whole interior is designed to look like a plane interior. Tip - The name your call to book with will be the "boarding pass" for your reservation. So you can make your experience a little more special if you're planning this for a special someone :
5
The airplane theme has been meticulously carried out which makes it both charming and clever...simply loved the landing videos shown. But it is the food...fish I had never tried or perhaps it was the parts of fish I never tried but loved! Original presentations such as the scallop dish with all parts of the scallop. The restaurant is up a flight of stars and small, so you should have reservations. No cocktails or wine sadly but great selection of sake (appropriate) and beer. Hope to return to Singapore again and will head directly to Sushi Airways
5
Was here for a dinner date with my fiancée and I loved the setting of the place. Definitely something fresh from the places we've been. As an ex airline staff, entering this place brought back some nice memory's I think the amount we pay for comes with the quality of the food. We had quite an enjoyable session and will definitely come back again. Attached photo is the yakiniku beef, eel sushi and something else I can't remember.Ordered the rice as well.

A client invited us here since they are themselves Japanese and wanted us to get the right impression of the country's sushi traditions. Which is exactly what we got in several ways. Very clean and inviting L-shaped desk which fitted the 9 of us. Behind the counter a "grown up" Japanese chef who made most of the food with his bare hands. Our Japanese clients could inform us that since men have colder hands, there are not many Japanese sushi chefs because their hands are too warm! I dont know! Anyway, the chef gave us interesting and useful information as we ate. The many different types of fish and small mixes of vegetables, sauces and other ingredients were delicately laid out and had a wide range of taste. Some good and some challenging for a Norwegian! Hence my hesitation of top score, a bit unfair really. Anyone looking for the real Japanese sushi exoerience should order ahead and go here. Recommended without hesitation

Sushi Airways offers an opportunity to enjoy good Japanese dishes in an outstanding atmosphere. The restaurant uses quite a lot of metal and aluminum elements for the appearance of sitting in a very old airplane. In addition, waiters are dressed as cabin attendants. Prices are high as most places in Singapore. Quality of served dishes is adequate, however not superior. It's worth a visit.
5
I am not much of a sushi person and, therefore, preferred to order some lightly cooked or fried Japanese food. The double shake roll was excellent with some added crunch from a crisply fried top up. Ebi fry was so fresh and perfectly fried that it literally melted in the mouth. Potato Koroke was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Goma soba was cooked just right. For dessert, tried the uber dark chocolate cake (Belgian?) which was very good. There are other favourable reviews of sushi items and I thought I would add mine about the fried items
5
The restaurant is pretty unique as it is in a design of an aircraft with a pretty good ambience. Beside that, You will get excellent service from the waitress in the restaurant. And of course the food prepared by the restaurant was really very fresh, especially the seafood. Although the location is a little inconvenient but it really worth going.
4
The restaurant is decorated around the theme of an airline- unique and creative. There was even a boarding pass on the table with the wait staff's name. The food was also creative and tasty, but I think I was more impressed with the ambience.
4
Price was really reasonable, especially during lunch time!Even though location is a bit inconvenient, it is worth having a try!In the concept of a DC-3, aviators will love to be there!However, seens from the television was not shown and the service is not really good. Thus losing 1/5 . However, will come back for the fresh seafood again

I went for the 3 course lunch menu for about $16. It came with a small bowl of miso soup, the teriyaki main was nice but small and a scoop of ice cream. I guess this is good value for this place as I saw some of the normal prices and they were insane. I had only just arrived in Singapore and had only changed a small amount of money into Singapore dollars, we worked it out and we had a couple of dollars left over. We asked for the bill and a 10% service charge had been added that wasn't mentioned on the menu which put us 25 cent over what we had. We told the woman how much we had hoping she would say it was okay because to be honest they didn't deserve a 10% tip anyway but she just let me go out on my own to find a money changer while my boyfriend waited inside. Very irksome indeed. The grape fizzy drink was nice and the plane theme very different but I wouldn't return. You can get more filling cheaper food from the many hawker stalls in Singapore
3
Potentially the best sushi I have ever had, and the theme of a DC3 was also really cool and original. My Dad is a pilot so he loved the footage of the DC3! But, it's a big and sad but and has been noted before in previous reviews - it got to 9:30pm and we were just finishing our meal for the waitress to ask if we would like to order any more food as they're closing the kitchen. Which we declined. About 10/15 minutes after (940), my father thought it would be nice to share 3 sakes together as it was a celebratory meal, only for them to say "sorry we close at 9:30" ... We didn't realise it was food AND drink they couldn't serve. What is normal protocol in the hospitality industry is that if you have customers you will serve them until they would like to leave. I understand there are policies and time restrictions but 9:30pm?! And all we wanted was a drink. We found it really disappointing and quite frankly rude to be kicked out when at the end of the day, you could have made more money from our custom and it was so early on in the evening. We did question this politely with the staff but they seemed rather rude and simply waiting for us to leave. Really not welcoming and it ruined our celebratory family night out. On the way out about 6 people were about to walk in - we had to tell them you're closed. Massive shame for you. You're losing money. Despite this, I would probably come back for the food because it is some seriously good sushi you're serving. But at like 6pm.

The location of this restaurant is not very clear as it is on the upper level. The sushi and sashimi were way above my expectation and for the first time, I had puffer fish - Grilled Fugu! It tasted like our Chinese Bak Kwa that is freshly baked out from the BBQ pit, sweet and tender. The downside is that for 2 pax, their smallest maki comes in set of 8! Hence I only managed to try 2 types. So if you have 4 pax or more, you can order more maki to try out the different varieties. The price is high but the dishes are totally different from those you find in common sushi chain - the texture, to the rice they used. I have to say one of the most unique Japanese food I have eaten in Singapore
5
Of course the price was a bit steep, but for me, it was an awesome experience. What i thought from outside to be a laidback sushi bar turns out to be a total enlightening concept dining experience. Trying to emulate cabin indoors of an airplane, it was definitely compact. But the other people dining did not bother us. With friendly chefs who are easy-going and warm, flight attendant-like gestures, it was fun. The food was brilliant. Or i supposed, unexpectedly brilliant. Sashimis melted in your mouth, rolls were tastefully different and we sat by the window with a view of baghdad/bussorah st on a post-rainy evening. Definitely chilled and gave us a heartwarming feeling. Try it for the experience!
5
We turned up without a reservation, and were lucky to get a table. The food was excellent and service efficient. It's not the cheapest place in town, but doesn't pretend to be, and given the freshness of the fish, I'm not surprised. I will definitely visit again when I am next in Singapore

Ate here after reading of this place on lady iron chef website. This is quite a small restaurant on the 2nd level of another restaurant along Baghdad Street. The place is quite interesting, and some of the features and the bar resembles closely to that of an aircraft. There are limited seats here. Probably only less than 30 people can be accommodated in here. Service is not too fast, and the food portion is pretty small. The upside is that the food served was pretty decent. Cost-wise, the lunch set was of decent value, but all other stuff seems a little expensive. Overall, would recommend to come once to check out the place and take some photos, other than that nothing much spectacular about the food
4
Well well well, i found out Sushi Airways on Fb and decided to check out Tripadvisor reviews for more information to check out this japanese place.Its a pleasantly nice decorated venue & airplane concept. I got to give due praiae that the sashimi moriawase is very fresh. The double salmon maki & lobster mango maki was highly mentioned in the reviews therefore we ordered to try. Its nice but not fantastically outstanding. Overpriced at $30 per plate for 8pieces. We went during lunch, they have very affordable bento's at $15+, the kurobuta pork katsu, very lightly crumbed. Overall its a average nice place to check out but it will not lured me to return again. I have tasted better japanese place that serves delicious makis and sashimi

￼I have frequented this cosy restaurant several times over the last year and a half. Each time I go I am impressed by how it has improved and grown both in the variety of specials on offer and the quality of the food. Located in the charming Kampong Glam area, it is unique in being a theme restaurant that serves high quality sushi and Japanese food at reasonable prices.Sushi Airways has an interior that resembles that of an airplane, specifically a DC-3. The walls are lined with windows made of sleek stainless steel in the characteristic rectangular shape with rounded corners bearing authentic rivets, and the open kitchen and counter seating sport a similar look. The feel is intimate and cosy without being cramped. At one end of the restaurant a large TV screen plays video clips taken by the pilot of a small aircraft as he landed in places like the Faroe Islands and Naples. Watch them and you will be mesmerised by the beauty of the clouds, sea and mountains as the aircraft approaches land. Much thought has gone into the design of the menus which are illustrated with airplane blueprints, and I spotted two genuine airline trollies and many other features which hint at the attention to detail that has made this place such a memorable dining experience.However it is not the interior design but rather the superb food which draws me back time and again. I used to go for the lunch sets which at $15 including miso soup, salad, green tea and ice cream are a steal. My favourite is the kurobuta tonkatsu but there are other choices which include chirashizushi, black sesame soba, salmon teriyaki and wagyu beef yakiniku.However of late I have been lured there by the fresh seafood and specials. The restaurant flies in fresh seafood four times a week and the chef expertly prepares some of the best hotate (live scallops) and uni (sea urchin roe) in town. Shirako (salmon milt) is another of the delicacies they offer.Indeed my recent dinner there was particularly good.My table of four started with the sashimi moriawase which Chef Wong can customise to your preference. Ours included otoro, ocean salmon, matsukawa karei (flounder from Hokkaido), sanma marinaded in ginger and spring onions and hamachi all perfectly sliced and beautifully presented on ice. We paired this with some delicious sparkling cold sake and everything disappeared before you could say “Hold your hotate!”.This was followed by superb oysters freshly shucked and seasoned in the chef’s special ponzu sauce.Sawagani came after, little perfectly formed ‘waterfall’ crabs which are deep fried till they turn a lovely orange. One crab makes for a flavourful, crunchy morsel. In spite of my many visits to Japan I had never before come across these, and my first time was in Sushi Airways. You certainly need to try them if you want to complete your Japanese dining experience!Then came the makis one, two and three. I have a special fondness for these and they are probably the reason I fell in love with this restaurant in the first place. The ebimaki is crunchy tempura prawn rolled in sushi rice, crusted with sesame seeds, and topped with crab mayonnaise, caviar and edible flowers. The double salmon roll is my personal favourite, the slices of salmon are blowtorched then topped with a crispy piece of salmon skin. The combined flavours and textures of the two as they enter the mouth are simply heavenly. Last but not least the lobster mango roll which has a generous piece of mango and lobster in mayonnaise atop wonderful brown sushi rice. I never come here without ordering at least one of these maki rolls and my kids absolutely adore them.We were pretty full after all that sushi but still had room for the chef’s off-menu special, a piece of tender rockfish braised with mushrooms and a hint of ginger in a flavoursome soya sauce, served warm and topped with spring onions and julienned cucumber. Comfort food at its best.￼￼￼Our meal cost a very reasonable $230 for four, including service. Amazingly they do not charge GST

A small but cosy place with friendly staffs and reasonable pricing food. The Uni is so delicious!! Sashimi Moriawase is also very good!! Oysters are very fresh!! I love the Lobster Roll too!! So delicious that I want to go back again soon!!
4
The restaurant offering cozy and clean atmosphere with good services. Price is fair enough and is a place that delivering the delicious sushi.
5
This is a little sushi/seafood gem in Arab Street quarter. It's very small but staff is great and chef does a great job too.
5
Really cool venue, staff really great. A little hidden, but worth seeking out. If you get the lunch time specials the price is awesome for the calibre of food. Atmosphere is just really fun.

I had dinner with my wife on a Saturday night and was very impressed with the food experience.Firstly the food. Fresh, quality well done sashimi, sushi and katsu. We were recommended the golden snapper and it was very good as sashimi.The katsu was perfectly done, tasty succulent pork and a soft crispy breaded coating, not overly hard breadcrumbs that usually end up cutting the inside of your mouth.We were also recommended a lovely smooth house sake that helped everything down nicely at only S$38 for a little bottle.The space itself is somewhat odd when you first arrive. Located on the 1st floor (upstairs) in Arab Street area it's small but then I very quickly forgot or rather realised it had been a meaningless thought when the food was presented.One issue was that the toilet is not closed off from the restaurant. I can see the issue they have as it is a small space. Another issue was that the sake on the menu were not actually in stock, nor was the cheesecake we ordered. And the staff were a bit hit and miss but that is Singapore for you.Nonetheless I will definitely be back again when the mood for well priced, quality Japanese strikes again and it won't cost you 250+ per person
5
My family enjoyed a fantastic meal here last week. The decor is like sitting in a 1950s aeroplane, with stainless steel everywhere. Chefs prepare all food about two metres from your table and the beers were extremely cold. Meals were excellent and it's great to be able to interact with the chefs while they prepare your meals. Highly recommended venue close to the very funky and alternative Haji Lane
4
My son's favourite sushi joint and since I'm back for a few days, we had lunch here. Cozy, small restaurant with interior and decor mimicking an aircraft! Cool concept, friendly staff and value for money! On days, they bring in live seafood which is worth it! Will come back again with my family next time I'm in town!
5
It was an interesting experience with the airline theme and we ate at the sushi bar. There were just so many options to choose from and the seasonal menu was great as well. The deep fried sawagani was so good that I wished I had ordered another portion. Would recommend to make a booking as the area isn't that big and you don't want to be waiting too long, Pricing wise a little on the high side but I suppose the quality was worth it
4
Tiny restaurant cutely decorated like the interior of an airplane. Although the chef is from Malaysia, to use an airline analogy, fortunately the dining experience is more like Virgin Atlantic than Malaysia Airlines or Air Asia - innovative, endearing, friendly. The seafood is very fresh - the tenaga tako (long-armed octopus) still moves in your mouth! In fact, the raw dishes (white escargot, uni, etc) tend to be better than the cooked dishes. Some of the preparations use too much sugar. Foodies must really do research to know about Sushi Airways, for it is lost among mediocre, touristy, Turkish eateries and not easy to find. Given a better location, this chef will go far
5
Went there last night with my best friend for his birthday. Food was top notch & the service impeccable. Although there were only us & another couple, there was always the waitress keeping an eye on whether we needed a top up for our hot tea or anything else.Tried some of their signatures, Mango Lobster Roll, Aburi Hotate Mentai Sushi & even their Uber Chocolate Cake. I'm very fussy about dessert but we ended up fighting for the last bite of cake. Mmm.Sadly the only complaint I am allowed to have is that the exterior of the restaurant would look better if it were an airplane like on their website. LO
4
Great place for some decent sushi in Singapore. The decor is a bit gimmicky (and I'm really not sure how it's relevant, but maybe I'm missing the point...) but you can forgive them for it. I'd recommend!

One has to ascend a short flight of metal steps to the tiny restaurant on level 2, made to look like the steps of an aircraft. In fact, the themed restaurant is made to give diners a very real in-flight experience - from its seats to windows to "boarding pass" upon arriving to "flight manual" which is the menu, and the waitresses whose uniforms resemble flight hostesses' one as well.The food came, and we had our Premium Assorted Sushi Platter (SGD$58.00) - consisting of a range of sushi with salmon, prawn, Toro (tuna belly), Uni (sea urchin), omelet, salmon roe etc. The seafood was fresh and the rice was cooked to the right texture - grainy but not hard nor mushy. We enjoyed these sushi very much.Next, we had the Sashimi Moriawese (SGD$58.00) - comprising of 3 slices of 6 different types of seasonal fish. Here we had Salmon, Sword fish, Tuna, etc. The sashimi was very fresh, and we were pleaesd with the thickness of each slice - taut, crisp and bouncy in their freshness.Then we shared the Lobster Mango Roll (SGD$30.00) , a long roll of goodness all swirled into one - omelet with sushi ginger, thick sliced cucumber, fresh mango, lobster salad and bonito flavored rice. The flavored rice had a gentle-but-distinctive fragrance to it, and the mango was sweet. The lobster was springy and sweet in its freshness, a delight for sure.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/dinner-at-sushi-airways-bugis.htm

We came here for lunch and were mighty pleased with the quality of the food and service. But first, let's talk about the store design and location. Sushi Airways is located on Baghdad Street near Haji Lane and Arab Street. And as you know, there are too many restaurants clustered in the area so you may not be able to find Sushi Airways easily. For easy reference, SA is located adjacent to Kampong Glam. It's on the secod floor of the building, with an aluminium staircase leading up to the landing. The restaurant is quite small inside with only a few tables and chairs so if you are planning to go during peak hours, it's advisable to make a reservation prior. When we arrived for lunch, we actually didn't have a reservation but since they have only a few customers at that time, we were given seats immediately. You will see some elements in the interior that might resemble an airline cabin but they fall short of becoming a total replica. But it's not really an issue because the food rocks!We ordered the Airways Bara Chirashi Sushi Set, which is a combination of chopped sashimi with soy wasabi over sushi rice and it came with miso soup, salad and dessert. It was really good! Price is 16sgd including GST. If you look at their menu, you'd probably want to taste them all; we were tempted to, in fact. But we'll save them for our next trip, which could be soon. This place is recommended
5
If you love Japanese food check this place. They have the freshest of sea foods and delicacies like shirako. Try their Yuzu ice cream before going away. The concept is fantastic and person who taught of this should be highly credited. Just go and check it out

Having been reading all the good remarks given by readers, and just nice my husband and I are nearby at that area, So we went ahead and dine with sushi airways. upon reaching, the staff asked if we had any reservation politely. After that, she usher us to seats that are near to the windows. There's no utensils placed there. No chopsticks, wet tissues nothing. I kinda expected that. Menu came late and the staffs is not there to take our orders. I still have to ask the staff for my drinks which are not served after my food are all here and my food are served later than those who came in after us. Before leaving with a heavy heart, I saw the staffs was interacting with all the diners asking How's their experience and food. And to my surprise they are introducing their menu to every diners that came in. But the staffs didn't even bother to explain and introduce their menu to us. What a disappointment. Salmon is really fresh. And food are really delicious. But if I were given a chance, most probably this will be my last time patronize this restaurant.

Just went there for anniversary dinner with bf. To avoid disappointment, you could make appointment by calling them first.You will be welcomed by all the friendly staffs once you step in. The environment is very cozy and very clean. really an airplane themed restaurant. even though it is not so spacious, but u still get ur privacy.Staffs are very attentive and friendly. esp the GM Ms Henny. We were very undecisive about the food. But she patiently recommended their signature dishes.We were very satisfied with the food. Sashimi is a MUST TRY. Very fresh n juicy!!! The oysters and scallops r very fresh too! Generally, the food wun disappoint u. :)I had liaise with their GM beforehand about the surprise for bf. She was very accomodative n understanding. And yes, my bf did get a shock when he came to know all these. I really appreciate the help frm staffs of sushi airways. They contributed to our unforgettable anniversary dinner. Highly recommended!Thanks again Sushi Airways. U guys are awesome ;

Stayed in the area and wanted sushi, so sought this place out after reading the reviews here. It is a bit of a challenge to find; Google Maps and even the TripAdvisor Map are not accurate. Stand at the intersection of Baghdad St and Bussorah St - facing toward the mosgue - it is on your left, across the street from LaMarelle Cafe. Take stairs to 2nd floor entrance to restaurant. This is the third sushi restaurant I've eaten in Singapore, and was the best in terms of quality, portion size, and price/value. Very nice selection of sushi, sashimi, rolls. My sushi selections (blue fin tuna, salmon roe, salmon belly, yellow fin tuna) were fresh, tasty, and with the largest pieces of fish I've had at any of the restaurants. Also had a spicy tuna roll, which had 8 pieces, and again, largest roll I've had. The roll was very tasty, with chopped tuna/scallions on top of each piece too. It is nontraditional Japanese ambiance as described here, but something different. Windows look down onto the street action, so if you're dining solo grab a seat by a window. Definitely "out-of-place" being amongst all the Middle Eastern shops and restaurants, but worth the visit. I will return

We went to sushi airways by the reccomendation of my colleague.At first, we thought what is the relation between sushi and airways. Like no relation at all.Well, just give it a try then. Anyway they have a set menu for lunch time. 15$ plus and you can get full set of japs food and dessert! The restaurant is at level 2 and have a cute aeroplane theme entrance. When you reached the second floor, there is this lady( not sure whether she is the ladyboss) who will give you the boarding pass. The venue is not so big. Almost half of the space is used for their sushi bar. Think you need to make a reservation if you wanna come in a big group.You can feel the aeroplane theme in this restaurant. Quite interesting!The set menu have a few interesting options. The chef recommendation is the churashi ( sashimi with vegetable and rice). Some of us order the churashi, while the others order the kurobuta( black pork), yakiniku( beef) , croquet , california roll and sushi.All of the set menu comes with a nice and tasty miso soup( with the seaweed and tofu), salad( the dressing is nice and it's a combination between the sesame oil, and some kind of peanut sauce).I ordered the kurobuta, abd it turned out to be nice. It's crispy on the outside, not oily at all and soft in the inside. You may dip the kurobuta with the fragrant and sour plum sauce, so it will be perfect.The rice, though it's not a japanese rice, it's still edible and generous with a sprinkle of sesame on the top.My friend who ordered the churasi all very satisfied with the food.It's a mixed between salmon, sea urchin, some kind of sea food ,vegetables and a bowl of rice.The matcha ice cream is very light. I couldn't even taste the matcha. It looked like the ice cream is a home made one. As usual, they provide ocha( japanese green tea) for the drink. The service was quite good, and with the lunch price (15$ plus) , we will come back again to enjoy the journey of japs food with Sushi Airways

Upstairs from the rather touristy cafes around Arab Street is Sushi Airways. Designed to resemble a sort of 1930's aeroplane complete with "stewardess" waitresses, it's a lot of fun to visit.The sushi was well prepared and managed to exceed many of the standard Japanese restaurants in Singapore both in terms of imagination and quality. Service was warm and friendly and we felt welcome throughout our visit.Whilst it's not a place for a glamorous dinner or a high-powered business meeting, it's very much ideal for a group of friends or maybe some out of town visitors on a budget. I might also go there again on my own if I'm in the area and need a quick after work snack

Arab Street has long been a favorite haunt when visiting Singapore, it offers a unique mix of old and new, and a wide variety of cuisine. After it "took off" as a hip, dining destination for tourists;(locals always new of the gems:) :) :) the cuisine on offer has widened in variety considerably. One can now find a virtual United Nations of food, however they are primarily oriented towards the cheaper, more affordable end of the market and the quality of produce, by and large reflects these price points. With a few notable exceptions, Arab Street area offered economy dining, filling, but not a meal one would remember fondly in those times when one reminisces about the great meals one has had. I believe this is primarily on account of the restaurant owners picking their menues and quality of produce with a certain , client spend in mind.Sushi Airways is refreshingly different, it is a bold attempt to redefine the perceived segmentation of the customer visiting in the area. In addition to the unique and tastefully implemented theme of a 30"s airline interior, it offers Japanese food of a quality one would normally associate with big name hotels or established top end restaurants. The product is obviously top of the line and a knowledgeable Chef, has produced a menu that will suit almost any patron looking for a Japanese "fix". The pricing is also unique, I was impressed with the range from Bento Boxed from S$ 15 to seasonal delicacies, flown in to order at more "high altitude prices"In all cases the price point is interesting, marginally more expensive than the "run of the mill" mass produced, conveyor belt "Japanese" fare, but much more affordable than a comparable dish at an established specialty restaurants, in the fancier parts of town, for a product every bit as well presented and of a comparable quality to the fancy specialty restaurants in the more expensive parts of town.Being fairly well experienced in satisfying my weakness for Japanese food around the world, I was very impressed with the quality of the produce, cooking and presentation, and the obvious enthusiasm and expertise of the chef and staff. For my family and my self, a definite "Must Return", God Willin
