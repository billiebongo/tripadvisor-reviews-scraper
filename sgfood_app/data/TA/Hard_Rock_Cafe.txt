Food, drinks and place are just okay. Nothing too fancy. I came there for the live music though, which is I’m very pleased because they are my favourite band. Overall, it’s just an average experience for me.

I just went to Hard Rock Cafe for my usually t-shirt purchase. The employees were very helpful and polite and did their best to help me.

Found this Eatery just back off Orchard Road a tad and decided to try it for lunch, from the moment we entered, the staff were very attentive and the service was quick, both of us had drinks within 3 minutes from ordering and the meal arrived about 25 minutes from ordering. Not bad for a serve of Ribs and a serve of fish and chips. Both meals were very big and I had trouble finishing the ribs which were sooo good I didn't want to leave any. Top marks to the staff! Only downside was the lack of Gluten Free options but this seems to be the norm everywhere in Singapor

One of my favorite in the region. Top notch service starts the moment you enter the doors of the cafe.The atmosphere is lively and the servers are always smiling and they seem never to be able to do enough for you...excellent, attentive, friendly, helpful. The best service staff in all the Hard Rock cafes in my region. They just make me feel at home whenever I visit the restaurant. Memorabilia previously belonging to, or signed by famous artists adorns the walls, as do numerous screens playing performances and songs from times past and present. My favourite drink "berrylicious" was taken off the menu yet they were still willing to serve that up for me when I requested for it

My husband, me, and our toddler were scheduled to meet a family friend who works in the very building where Hard Rock Café is located (on the ground floor), and since this was a weekday and our friend would have to be back in officer within a reasonable time, she suggested that we have lunch at Hard Rock Café. We arrived at 12.30, when—barring one largeish table—the place was empty. As in all HRC outlets, there is lots of hard rock memorabilia around: framed clothing of rock stars, guitars, and so on. There’s also a stage for live shows (and more, as we discovered to our delight later on), plus large flat screens on which they played music videos of some classics. The menu is pretty mouthwatering, crowded as it is with salads, burgers, sandwiches, ribs and more. We three adults weren’t too hungry (and our toddler eats very little), so we decided to order just two dishes: a full rack of glazed pork ribs, and a bowl of pho bo, the Vietnamese beef and noodle soup. The pho, slippery rice noodles, thinly sliced and very tender beef, a flavourful broth, and a bunch of very fresh herbs and more—basil, green coriander, mint, raw onions, spring onions and lime—was delicious. The pork was simply out of this world: tender, succulent, falling off the bone, and so tasty that one didn’t need any of the accompanying sauce (refried beans? I’m not sure) or the cole slaw with it. On the side were a generous helping of thick cut potato chips, delicious. Our toddler loved HRC. Firstly, there was a bunch of balloons on offer as soon as she entered, and armed with one, she was assisted into a high chair, with a cheery set of plastic crockery and cutlery being brought for her. The staff were very friendly too, and when—by coincidence—one of them realized it has been our child’s fourth birthday, the previous day, a surprise was conjured up for her. When she finished eating, a waiter came along with a cute-looking cup of ice cream, cherry on top, and took our daughter off to the stage. There, a candle was placed on the ice cream, lit, everybody’s attention drawn, and ‘Happy birthday to you’ sung to her by all the restaurant, staff and customers. I have a feeling just about every other attraction we saw in Singapore paled in comparison to this one, as far as our little girl was concerned. She loved it—and we loved it not just because she loved it, but because it was such warm, friendly place and the food was so good
5
We had a really good time. the food was good and the bank playing was really good. Only thing is the last order was at somewhere around 10.pm and then its a just the music.. wish they could extend serving drinks and food at least till about 12
5
Dropped in to another HR Cafe to visit the rock shop to add another hurricane glass to the collection! Great service, great memorabilia, Elvis Bar is a must see. As always HR have another great restaurant! Hard rock Location number 22
5
Loved the burgers!! Cheese and bacon with fries. Needed it all,after a long walk up and down Orchard Road. Very good value
3
Service is not as attentive as before. It was for birthday celebration(using 1 for 1) but we were not prompted if are celebrating and there was therefore, no arrangement for the signature hot fudge sundae with birthday song singing. Food is still good though on the salty side as always
4
We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Hard Rock Cafe. Entertainment was liveFood was really tasty and well prepared with service from waiters fast and attentive to our needsThe starter spring rolls was absolutely lovely and we tried the salmon and also the pepper steak. Both dishes really tasty and well presented.Cocktails for the evening was Singapore Sling and Long island Ice tea which both were in generous glasses at an additional 5$’sTypical to HRC, loads of interesting music paraphernalia and nice shop to get Singapore HRC t’s and souvenirs.Great for families, singles or couplesWe had a Rocking good tim
4
We were pleased with our dining experience at this location. We ordered the burger, two Caesar salads with chicken, and a plate of nachos. All food was tasty, and they were generous with the cheese on the nachos.What made an impression at this location was the music selection. I typically am NOT impressed at other locations, but here the playlist is actually decent. Well done
4
I have been eating at the Hard Rock Cafe off Orchard Road since it opened. The staple dishes are still mouth watering, succulent & damm good value for money. Their drinks are legendary & the entertainment has maintained its standard among party goers. You can’t go wrong for a great night out.
5
This Hard Rock continues with the usual high standards expected from the international chain. Great atmosphere in here with great food
4
This restaurant has been our monthly place to eat. There is a a lot of food choices to try and the atmosphere is really amazing. I am a music lover so I enjoy the best of both worlds. There are also discounts for food and promotions which we always try. Staff is friendly and service is great
5
My daughter was super excited to go to the Hard Rock Cafe. We were seated immediately even though we had no booking! The burger and ribs were fantastic! Too full for pud! Will be back
5
I’ve been a big fan of Hard Rock ever since I had my 21st birthday celebrations at HRC. And I’m delighted to have introduced my husband and daughter to this establishment. Now, we have our family tradition to come at least once a year and my daughter loves having her birthdays at Hard Rock too. The music always kept her entertained and the food never disappoints. We especially like the weekday lunch sets. $15 for salad/soup, main dish and Häagen-Daz ice-cream for dessert is worth every bite!
5
Our all time favourite American food joint. Service is always good and food portions are still as big.
5
I’m a regular patron of Hard Rock Cafe, and this place is special to me because it was the restaurant that we took my father to celebrate when he was recovering from a major spinal operation and was well enough to walk again in 2015. I remember the great service and the extra attention paid to him, together with the manager personally wishing him a speedy recovery and gifting him with a Hard Rock Cafe. Fast forward 2 years later, I brought my boyfriend and his family here on 27 Dec 2017 to celebrate his 30th birthday and it was an awesome celebration! The food and service continue to be excellent. We enjoyed a meal of delicious burgers and Hard Rock also surprised the birthday boy by inviting him to the stage, presenting him with a complimentary sundae and getting the entire restaurant to sing him “Happy Birthday.” I also appreciate how the staff serve with constant smiles and take many photographs of us without any complaints. Thank you for making his 30th Birthday Celebration a memorable and special one! And yes, I will continue to be a great fan of Hard Rock!

I have never been a huge fan of Hard Rock's deco or theme. However, I used to patronise the place for good quality Tex-Mex. It's been years since I've last been to one and recently we were in the vicinity looking for lunch and came upon its lunch set on a weekday.$15 nett for soup/salad, main course, dessert and a drink. Though the main course sounded a little non-Hard Rock, it was too good a value to pass - as long as it was of passable quality.That's the problem. Quality.The broccoli soup I had was ok. The salad my companion had was not very fresh. The pork cutlet of my main was thin and dry, while the other's fried chicken tasted alright only if you remove the thick layer of batter. Rice on mine was cold; while her mashed potato looked yellow and not very appetizing. The fried onions were so thin and stringy they looked like spider legs. The worst was the vegetables. The broccoli, cauliflower and carrots were all looking visibly past their fresh date. We left them untouched.At the end of the day, the drink of ice-tea was more memorable.Oh, and the place caused me to itch which is an indication that it was dirty.$15 nett is very good value but where's the Hard Rock where one went for reliable food
3
Ordered for burgers to be medium done, both came well done. Staff were too busy to even notice me as I tried to get their attention, and it was not even close to peak dinner time yet. At least they allowed for my fries to be changed into a side salad. Hope the standards will be a better one the next time I am back
5
Food was amazing! Ambience and band were good, staff were friendly! Liked the hot fudge brownie dessert the most! :)
4
Hard Rock Diners are consistently good in various parts of the world and this outlet is no different. The service staff are friendly and prices are reasonable.
5
Came here a few times during my visit as didn’t disappoint, each night seemed to have entertainment on. Good food and drinks and great staff
2
I am the BIGGEST fan of hard rock cafe - we went to the one on santosa 4 times on our 1 week stay then realised there was one in the city and tried it out. 1. Our pina colada came out not blended. We had to send them back... for $25 A drink it should be drinkable. They re made it better however it was weak and we really didn't drink it... A shame as this is one of our fave!2. The wings came out dry but good. They are the best wings I've ever tasted in my life. The pieces of carrot they were accompanied with however were dried up and shriveled and I wouldn't touch them. The one on santosa are fresh and orange like carrots should be for the prices they charge. Massive fail. 3. The staff are GREAT! Can't fault them. Thumbs up. They even gave our baby a balloon and drawing book which we appreciated. This hard rock needs to be managed according to santosa standard because it is shameful in comparison.
3
The potato skin is very niceThe salmon is over cooked (the meat is dry), but the portion is generous.The ambience is casual and relax. Suitable for family and big groups / gatehrin
2
We tried to go to this cafe 2nights in a row and was booked out for functions bother nights! The first night understandable but should have told us also booked out the next day!
4
We recently enjoyed a family meal at Hard Rock Singapore. The service was excellent and the food was tasty and enjoyable, up to the usual high standards of Hard Rock. However, on the night we went there, they had a private party downstairs, and although we were seated upstairs, the music was so loud, that it prevented us talking freely and communicating with one another. Most people upstairs seemed to have the same problem with the noise. Whilst it is understandable that they hold private parties and live musicians make loud noise, it definitely did detract from what otherwise would have been a perfect meal and evenin
5
We had a nice dinner in this rocking Cafe. Yet another HRC visited and we loved this one too! Staff was really friendly and drinks and food was delivered in no time. Texan sandwich could not have been better. The atmosphere was rocking as was the music played. We just might have to come back for another visit on our two week vacation in Singapore. ++
4
A fun place for a birthday celebration. Staff gets entire place to join in birthday song to birthday person, and if you're sporting enough, on the stage too!Had ribs which were excellent. Unfortunately the iconic HRC fajitas were very average at best.Excellent staff service
5
Loved this place. We always check out Hard Rocks and visited twice during our stay, the second evening with live acoustic music. A bit embarrassing to have the group sing Happy Birthday to me,(but at least no standing on chairs!) And a dessert with a candle..Food usual good value- huge plate of nachos and entrees fine- and a great dark beer on promo.Short walk from Orchard Road metro. Really friendly people. Recommend
4
Interesting 3-course lunch set menu that changes every week and get your 6th lunch meal for free is plus. Do visit!
4
The wagyu cheese burger is good, but what impresses me is the service from the waiter and waitress. Will go back for more.
4
The food was Ok as i get to eat something new. But when come to make payment it is very slow as their system was down.
4
Surprise Hard Rock Cafe has a very good Lunch set menu a very good setting for quite business meeting
4
Had dinner. Nice atmosphere. Food was good and service was prompt. Good place for friends gathering as well as for couple
4
Came for for dinner and ordered a half slab bbq, chicken tenderloin and a salad with chicken. The bbq ribs was nice and the portion of the salad was huge. The meal cost us around SGD77 for 3 adults which is pretty reasonable for dinner. Noticed that they even have some Asian dishes in their menu now. Nice touch
4
As much as I love SE Asian food, I admit that I get tired of rice, noodles, and soup... LOL.This is the best place to go and get some burgers, ribs, nachos, and reset your tastebuds.Always good food, same experience as all other HRC. So if you need a break from the local food, stop here
3
Very much in the style of Hard Rock cafes the world over. Usual menu of burgers, steaks, ribs etc with all the trimmings. The meal was tasty and relatively copious, but don’t expect haut cuisine. Good appetizing food for someone with a good appetite. At certain times you get the addition of live music which can be very entertaining. Makes for a good evening out
4
Had the weekday set lunch. Chose sea bass and chicken quesadilla mains. Sea bass was good portion but quesadilla was disappointing as it's totally different from the usual ala carte quesadilla - never mind it's already all folded and ready to eat, but portion was small.Friendly service. Interesting music vids on screen
3
The décor somehow feels less iconic or warm than the London original, perhaps because of fewer illustrious memorabilia. The food is typical American fare - burgers, ribs, steaks, salads, etc (although there is phở bò/Vietnamese beef noodle soup!) - well executed, but nothing extraordinary or gourmet. What’s best here are the service staff - super friendly and pro-active.
4
I almost always visit a Hard Rock in all the new places I come to. We ate a classic burger and ribs. The hamburgers were perhaps a little dry but the ribs were absolutely top. Good, fast and very friendly service.
3
The portion has reduced. I ordered the ribs and the fajitas. Not Wow. nothing special. Presentation is weak. Jive Talking is still good! Cocktails are weak too and pricey. Not worth it.
4
We had a family lunch here. The staff were excellent in regards to attitude, speed and friendliness and the food was tasty and well portioned.
5
Spotted the restaurant on the hop on hop off bus so decided to go visit .Had the half rack ribs really tasty with fries coleslaw and beans yum.I sat at the bar and Alvin was so friendly and chatty made my visit here memorable .He also made great mocktail and encouraged me to try the chocolate brownie it was delicious .Thankyou
5
A regular Sunday family lunch here. Kids eat free for every main meal ordered and it worth it! The sounds are definitely what my husband enjoyed the most! We had a great time here. It's good for a hard-rock cafe to turn into a more family friendly place in the daytime and the kids enjoyed the free colouring sets
5
Sept.2017 . What a great Place . A nice Location , very friendly Staff and good Music . The Hard Rock Cafe was full , i went to the Bar . It was a Pleasure to listen to this Music .I ordered a Cheeseburger , it was good . After that i bought a nice Pin and a T-Shirt . So it is highly recommended 
3
The burgers were as good as ever, and the fries were great. Friendly servers. But all a bit rushed, and we were initially given the worse table in the house, even though we reserved the previous day and arrived 5 minutes early. But the food and atmosphere were standard HRC, which we enjoy once in a while
5
The Hard Rock Singapore is located just off Orchard road. The food & drink is always good in the cafes and is a must where ever we go on our travels, you always know what your gonna get at the Hard Rock Cafe, plus good music
4
Really had a GOOD time at this Hard Rock. Price was average for a Hard Rock, no more - no less than any other, and it was CONSISTENT with most Singapore restaurants in the area.GREAT selection of menu items to include foods unique to this area. I REALLY enjoyed the Chili Crab dip with the tortilla chips (SUPERB), and the Burgers are TASTY. I had the Java Lava which I would RECOMMEND.The atmosphere was FUN, and the service was ABOVE AVERAGE. They were playing a mix of old school MTV music videos with some modern day selections.Lastly, I thought the merch selection was AWESOME for a smaller Hard Rock, and the prices were VERY REASONABLE. They had a buy three T's get the 4th free promo. I was able to outfit the entire family.While I wouldn't say this is a MUST DO, I would say MAKE SOME TIME and POP IN for a look.
5
Love the Wide range of food but beware of the portion Super huge! Please do share a burger or main course together if you are not a heavy eater.. love the service staff very busy but very helpful! Rmb to tell them that u wanna surprise ur Friend on his or her birthday! They will do it for ya! Ard 15 mins walk "Turn Left after Hilton hotel
4
The food is scrumptious on Tuesday 12 September & the service is good 😊 My Boyfriend & I enjoyed the time
5
Always a favourite place to go to for American food. Big portions and child friendly. Service is always tip top.
4
Always visit a hard rock whenever we are away and this one was much like the rest. Friendly efficient service. Wasn't busy early evening. Free wifi. Nice menu with some locally inspired dishes which was good to see. Expensive though to anyone from the UK.
5
Always love to visit a Hard Rock Cafe when ever there is one when I visit cities all over the world and this one didn't disappoint
5
my daughter celebrated her 7th birthday here.
loved the food the ambiance and theor surprise to my daughter.
she's extremely delighted and is full of glee!

I have to compare this to the HRC in my home city Manchester England. I have coeliac disease and Manchester has a full gluten free menu including burgers buns and fries. The Gluten free menu is also online with all the other food menus.I assumed it would be the same in Singapore. I checked online and there was no Gluten free menu, and the actual menu was not actually costed which I think is unhelpful.I explained to our server that I needed to eat Gluten free and he brought a menu. The menu comprised more health information than actual food and the choices were very limited with no starters. The main courses were also limited and I couldn't have a burger minus the bun because burgers and buns were all grilled on the same rack hence cross contamination. I ended up ordering a pepper steak without the sauce and mash potato. The food was nice but I was really disappointed that I couldn't get a burger. I accept that they do not have GF beer and was happy to drink the cider however they had run out, which was extremely disappointing. The staff were great the two bands were excellent and the atmosphere was typical Hard Rock, however the lack of Gluten free food and drink was poor
4
My husband and I found the food to be good but it is quite expensive, even for Singapore! We both enjoyed our meals and even splurged on a dessert! I'm vegetarian and I had the veggie burger, it was tasty! It is quite far out of town so be prepared for a taxi ride! Would recommend eating here but not if you're on a budget
4
Went here in june with my 2 year old. Great service and they really went out of their way to interact with us all. As with any hard rock great music. Food was ok nothing special and probably a bit over priced however i cannot comlement the service any highe
5
The nearest MRT to this Hard Rock is Orchard. Just turn left and walk a short way and you're there. Very simple to get there. The cafe itself is very similar to other Hard Rock's and we had a fabulous meal. When we were about to pay the bill I asked if we were entitled to any discount (cheeky, I know) and he asked if I was planning on buying anything from the store. When I said that I wanted a t-shirt for my daughter, he told me not to pay the bill just yet, but to buy the t-shirt first and the staff in the merchandise area would give me a 15% discount ticket to be used with food. Bargain! Top notch service too
2
Just dine there this afternoon, my medium steak was seamingly over-cooked. The portion was quite generous, and I ended up leaving most of my food unfinished. Very disappointing! Not worth the money
5
We had wanted a no-frills american burger dinner and hardrock most certainly did not disappoint. The legendary burger was nice and juicy with a hunk of an 8 oz beef party. The slow braised beef brisket was nice and tender too.
5
All food ordered were terrific, most esp the Java Lava Burger - really delicious and really hit the spot; will definitely come back for more.
4
Worth a visit just to see David Bowie's eight string bass!! Food was good and service could not be faulted. Typically Singapore expensive.
5
Have a very nice dinner at hard rock cafe celebrating my cousin's birthday. The life band was very accomodating when we requested to dedicate songs and wishing my cousin happy birthday on stage. Staffs were very friendly, helpful and portray very good customer service. Food portion was huge and good. Many people celebrating birthday here. Recommended!
5
Execellent food n service. Price is slightly pricy. Will definitely visit again. Great for birthday celebration
4
Just off Orchard Road this Hard Rock is a good size. Very small shop but the restaurant and stage area bigger than average I would say. Bar staff very friendly and had time to have a chat as it was not busy. This being a Hard Rock means you pay more for everything. Dont know why but thats how it is in every one I have been around the world. Still, you have to pop in for at least one beer!There are other bars close by so it could be part of a bit of a night out
4
I was a massive fan of the artichoke dip and the appetiser combi which has since been changed, but the burgers were just as amazing as always. I highly suggest this place for a satisfying burger dinner. No nonsense, no frills, just a deliciously prepared one. AND IT ACTUALLY CAME MEDIUM DONE, AS REQUESTED!Order the onion rings too, your belly will thank you for it.
5
Excellent service, friendly staff. Burgers were awesome!!! Love the "live" band music on Friday nights!
2
A little hard to find and once found, after visiting 10 or so Hard Rock locations I was confronted with the first non-accessible for wheelchairs-this in a city that is otherwise so accessible, I was shocked!Staff did their best and opened a side door which then lead to around 5 steps and on to an elevator and through a back door. Staff offered to do the same in reverse when time to leave, however it was 'easier' to traverse the 20 steps down to the road instead for me. It was quite a task for me. Needless to say there were no accessible facilities inside the restaurant that I could see either. Now- this is an American style restaurant in a readily modern and accessible city, isn't it?Other than this, the fare and drinks were the usual from Hard Rock. Good food and drink, if only they didn't discriminate. Disappointed.
3
Visited on a family holiday (two adults and three teenagers) that we had decided to visit every Hard Rock Cafe on, i.e. Hong Kong, Singapore, Bali and Dubai. We arrived around 16:00 so fairly quiet and service very fast and friendly. Unfortunately I found my burger very greasy and did not finish. Also food and drink expensive, as Singapore is, although price did include a Hard Rock T-shirt
4
Advise to make reservation in advance.
Sometimes they do have private function / events.
Few dishes to recommend: Jumbo Combo (consist of signature wings, onion rings, Tupelo chicken tender & bruschetta, spinach artichoke dip with flat bread) - sharing plate and value for money
4
Good food...but price little high.
Not the best decorative Hard Rock I been to, and tables set tight together.
Maybe better use time in Santosa 😜
4
The service here is one of the better I've experienced in Singapore.
Atmosphere is nice with music videos screening on stage. The burgers we had were decent too.
5
After trying all the Asian cuisine there was a wish to eat some fast food style and of course the best choice is Hard Rock Cafe tasty food, deserts and welcoming place to be.
5
Great food excellent service and awesome decorations. What else can you expect from Hard Rock! Rock on!
4
We went for set lunch which is good value. Staff friendly and welcoming. Will definitely visit again
5
Service was generally good although the initial request to move to a larger booth table toaccommodate our baby was turned down by waitress though we had a booking. A larger table was freed up and we approached another waiter who gladly acceded to our request. Ordered the spinach & artichoke dip and Texan sandwich again. Dip was still nice but portion seems to have shrunk since our last visit. Texan pulled pork was flavorful & moist. However food is generally too salty & greasy.
4
Went there with my wife. Maybe not the most typical Hard Rock Cafe that you would find around the world, since it is slightly off downtown and you would need to go looking for it, but cannot complain. Everything was clean and the food delicious. What was strange was that although the place was half full (at best) we were seated next to the toilets, but then again, we did not complain nor asked to be changed
4
Came here with my family! Had a great time eating and chilling out with them. Food was tasty (as usual), and the band was terrific! Went on a Saturday night. The place is newly refurbished, and it's looking better than ever! Highly recommended for anyone who's looking to have a great time. Received free brownies too
5
My husband and I are big fans of Hard Rock and try to visit a Cafe whenever we're travelling. This was our first visit to Singapore's Hard Rock Cafe and we were not disappointed in the slightest. The staff were fantastic, very friendly, welcoming and efficient. The quality of the food was excellent and when my husband told one of the waiters that it was my birthday, I was treated to a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday" by the staff and most of the other customers, plus a bonus sundae! We look forward to many more Hard Rock Cafe experiences in many more cities
4
It was good to have the friends and coworks together. The food is quite big enough to share. The locaton is also good!!
5
The portion of serving is very huge, we could not finish our food. The waiter and waitress were super nice and friendly. We have an awesome family time.

4
Whenever I'm in a town that has one of these that I haven't been to I have to try it so we went here and we sure weren't disappointed. Very good food and great service. We highly recommend this place, at least for lunch.
5
we only popped in to use the shop to purchase a few gifts to take back to UK. Small Shop with the usual range of Hard Rock branded goods
1
Been to Hard Rock's all over the globe and this would be the poorest excuse I've ever seen. In a quiet back street off Orchard Road, up a long flight of stairs to a large open area. I think there is a second level but it was in darkness the day I was there. Bar snacks and Sav Blanc @ $17 a glass (and it wasn't that good). Gotta lift their game before I'll bother climbing the stairs again
3
excellent service, great fries, not impressed by the WBT burger.. waiters were quick to respond, and always with a smile :) the patty wasn't up to expectations, but the curry artisan fries were awesome :
4
Great staff, awesome vibes all around! The food was decadent, bar grub with a standard. I had The Tennessee burger, one of the options from the World Tour, and it was hard to hold an actual conversation with my partner when our burgers came because it was impossible to stop chomping away at the glorious burger. SO INSANELY JUICY, AND WHAT A HEARTY STACK IT WAS. I strongly recommend the artichoke dip for starters. Not quite the place for a close and sweet dinner encounter because of the blaring music, but it is surely a place to return to for some fun
5
Beer and fries and great mood. Cool weather inside when outside is hot and humid . Many young people enjoy their stay
4
Great atmosphere! Only it took us quite a long time to be served,but so much to see it didn't really matter. Can you tell us what year you first opened
5
when I was been to different country. I am look the Hard Rock cafe. because this is classic for me. "Combo plate menu" is number one for us.Thank you Singapore Hard Rock Caf
4
A trendy stop to visit Hard Rock Cafe for a souvenir or a meal.
Accessible by MRT or SIA hop on bus stop close by Orchard road hotel stop.
Nightly entertainment and comedians available for a good laugh.
Booking essential for comedian shows.
5
True,blue HRC style. Kumar's performace is hillarious as usual. Great drinks, great service. Rock shop stuff is amazing, grabbed 4 tees & want more. One of the best outing I have ever had in Spore.
5
We escaped to Hard Rock from the pouring rain. The food and customer service, as usual, was fantastic. We visit the Hard Rock in most cities that we visit and are very rarely disappointed
5
Great music night. Many kids played instruments and sang. Delightful experience. Food was awesome and so was atmosphere was lively
5
I have visited other HRC and this one lives up to expectations. Good atmosphere, typical HRC cuisine with oriental options, very tasty
4
Nevermind if you can't finish your food. Wastage is part of the American culture. Food quantity at Hard Rock Cafe is incredibly generous. Hence you'll surely be unable to finish all the items on your plate. You will enjoy your food. Pity in Singapore, Hard Rock Cafe felt more like HRC Manila with most of the crew Pinoy. Used to have really nice American students on internship or on vacay. These days, cheap crew from Pinoy have come on board and it really kills the feel at Hard Rock Cafe
3
We were hankering for a bit of home and found great burgers and fries. service was super, and when the rain hit they even offered to get us back to our hotel with an umbrella. Nice vib
5
Good food especially their baby back ribs which the meat just fall of the bones. Nice atmosphere but feels a bit dated, otherwise it is a good place to have nice food and couple of drinks
4
Burger was good as ever - they are consistent amongst all HRC to which I have been.I came right at 11:30am on a Sunday. Place was fairly empty.I was served very quickly initially, but was tough flagging anyone down for follow through service and check out. Plenty of help on hand too.That being said, all the staff was polite and had great attitudes. Just need to be a more aware of customer needs.Still would go back - love the burger fix when needed
4
Visited here for a meal and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, which although is primarily 'fast food' is well cooked and very edible in pleasant surroundings with rock tapes running and a room filled with rock memorabilia. When we were there the majority of the customers were Westerners. I'd happily return for a further meal
5
Not a huge space for a Hard Rock but is is big enough, the food was very good and the staff was very friendly!
4
Came to one of my favorite places worldwide. I went shopping in the Rock Shop and had a coupon for discounts on drinks inside. The was like a Stand-up Comedy which was very funny. I really enjoyed it!
5
Stopped off here before doing some shopping. Ordered the "Texan" pulled chicken sandwich which is something I've not seen on a HRC menu before. The food was excellent, decent portions & reasonably priced. The service was also excellent which is not always the case. The servers were very attentive & came to ask me if my food was to my liking. I would definitely return to this HR
5
HRC Singapore is a great representation of the Hard Rock Brand. Good food, great memorabilia on the walls and very friendly service. This Cafe is right in a great part of town for shopping and is convenient to many hotels and sites. If you are abroad and long for some American Cuisine (aka burgers and wings) then the Hard Rock Singapore should be on your agenda

Unbelievably good! Had the Country Fried Chicken and Dory Fish at S$25++ for 2 - with a choice of soup/salad, soft drinks/ice lemon tea/coffee/tea; and a scoop of Häagen-Dazs ice cream! Great food, great service and great value, indeed! Note: They serve different set lunches weekly; and was told the Chilli Crab Spaghetti in 3 weeks time a must try!

Had lunch at HRC in Singapore last Friday. I've been to many HRCs around the world and they are consistently good in all areas. Food, service, ambience. I had their classic burger with onion rings and a soft drink this time. I really had to force myself to go out for dinner as I was well fed at HRC for a late lunch
5
I've been to many hard rocks and loved this one. To be honest I only went in to escape the rain but ended up stopping all day and into the night as was having so much fun. The steak was incredible and I made friends with many people who like me were on their own. The shop is well stocked and in a great location.
5
Went here with my wife and disabled daughter who is in a wheelchair about 8ish one night.As there are steep steps into the cafe and no other visible means of entry, my wife popped in to ask if the was disabled access. The staff were fantastic ,one escorted us to a side door while another operated an internal lift. Once in the cafe they moved tables and chairs to accommodate my daughter.Great service.The only negative thing I can say is there is no disabled access sign. A disabled access ask for assistance sign at the bottom of the steps would be a good idea

I always visit HRC if they are in a city I visit. The one in Singapore is better than average but its not up there with the best of then (read London). But its fine, it is lacking the atmosphere and Rock stuff originality but location is central and easy to reach. OK service and food.So its ok to god if HRC is your thin

Enjoyed this Hard Rock Café the restaurant was clean and tidy and service was good. The food is typical of Hard Rock but that's why I enjoy it, branding is sometimes good. Goid choice of beer. It was quiet but then at 4 oclock on sunday afternoon it's probably the norm. Anyways, enjoyed the visit, the food, the beer and the music. Cheer
5
Friendly, polite and attentive service staff. Can hardly find such excellent service in Singapore. All the service staff service with a smile. Food is superb and reasonably priced.
5
Service was very attentive and food portion was Generous. Recommend for celebrations & family gatherings.

Have been to quite a few Hard Rocks...but by far this is the best in terms of Music. Was there on 26th Jan 2017 and was thoroughly entertained by the band playing. Thursday is the night to be there if you like to croon as they invite the guests on stage. Super entertaining band! My friend who generally isn't too impressed with Hard Rock live music was pretty high on music that night! Thank you Hard Rock Singapore
1
Foof failed to arrive 1 hour after ordering so had to give up and go to a proper restaurant. The problem seemed to be that it was grossly understaffed. Drinks ordered were forgotten on both occasions. An annoying waste of time
5
Made an online reservations and indicated that it was for my daughter's 16th Birthday family dinner. They called back to confirm the time and occasion. We were greeted warmly and cheerfully at the door. The service staff that took our order was simply awesome, upon hearing that my gals will be sharing the burger, she offered to cut the burger into 1/2 but what was unexpected was that they actually served the burger onto 2 plates complete with fries and salad for both plates.. The food was delicious and servings was huge. Must try the nachos and milk shake :)Unexpectedly also, they arranged for a Birthday Sundae specially "delivered" by the awesome band - Energy. It was a memorable experience. Thank you Hard Rock

Situated just off the top end of Orchard Road the Hard Rock cafe' is more "tucked away" than "tourist attraction" and requires the use of public transport from the city centre. Like all other Hard Rock cafe's there is musical memorabilia hanging from every wall but unlike others the background music was subdued. The menu again is very similar to all other H R cafe's in both selection and price. The obligatory H R shop is located ground floor beside the entrance
5
Simply l love everything about your place. Food,service,music everything out of the world!! I came there for dinner with my friends.it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. Your service crew is really accommodating with any special requests. So guys thank you so much for the wonderful time and food plus hospitality. See you guys soon!!

Visited early evening with friends for meal & drinks. The food was lovely however very expensive even for Singapore. Staff were lovely, the restaurant was very busy but this did not affect the service.
2
I was really looking forward to going to the Hard Rock for dinner, we used to go quite a bit before but noticed the food keep on deteriorating so stopped going. Then I read about the renovations and thought maybe they will sort out the food as well. Not so. I took my family there for dinner, and I have to start by saying the renovations were nice and the service was excellent. There was absolutely no fault with the service at all, they really try hard and were very attentive. But the quality of the food was pretty bad. Chicken Fajitas had no taste, ribs were full of fat and my 13 year old could not eat her macaroni and cheese. When a kid cant eat macaroni and cheese you know you have hit a new rock bottom! So we paid the bill, which was $180 with no alcohol. Wont be going back anytime soon
4
We dropped into the Hard Rock cafe early on Saturday evening for a quiet drink and bite to eat. We sat at the bar and were pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere. Good music was being played, a band was being set up for later in the evening and live sport was being played.Unfortunately there was no sparkling wine. However, the rest of the drinks list (and the Singapore chilli crab) was very good
4
Warm welcome, place was quite empty.
Ordered chicken fajitas, well served and tasty.
Later on the evening a local band joint the stage which managed to cheer up the crowd.
2
But really is sub-par. Food in general is overpriced, even for Singapore, and service below par. Seems as though the expectation is you should be thankful to be there. Too many other options, but if you feel you need to check the HR Singapore box, go for it. Drinks remain good though
4
Well great location just off the main and most famous shopping street orchard road .Tried and tested menu so you can't go wrong .. a little smaller than others however the service great , food good , portions large . Memorabilia a little limited nobody very famous ! The entertainment very very loud and noisy but that's Hard Rock ! Keep your reciept to get a discount in the shop ! Worth a visit ...
5
We are living in Singapore again and today we went for lunch and had our favourite fajitas. Having been in quite a few Hard Rock Cafes around the place this one did not disappoint. The fajitas come on a sizzling hot plate it only comes with 4 wraps but you can always ask for more however 4 is plenty, try their Irish Coffee Kiss as its fantastic, staff are very attentive and yes sometimes overly but that is the usual you would complain if you didnt get the attention so enjoy it. We will definitely be going again
3
Having been fortunate enough to visit half a dozen Hard Rock Cafes worldwide I have to say this was a disappointing experience. The food was perfectly acceptable. Fajitas were on special the night we went so I had the beef and Linda the chicken. Plenty of food but only four small fajitas made for messy eating. The service was fine with the staff attentive - overly so at times, probably because they were bored as there were so few customers. The disappointment was the atmosphere in the place. It was flat. Yes rock music was playing but the place just lacked something. The location off the very top of Orchard Road doesn't help. We called because it was close to our hotel but I am glad we didn't have to make much effort
3
We collect Hard Rock Cafe guitar fridge magnets. After the disappointment of trying to visit the (closed) Hard Rock Cafe in Melbourne, we eagerly went to this cafe for a bite to eat, drinks and to buy our souvenir.Sunday, 8 January 2017, the cafe was heaving. Live guitar groups were playing (differing standards) and the atmosphere was lively. Our drinks and meals were served quickly and were enjoyable. Service was excellent. Just a little noisy ..
5
Visted Hard Rock with family & had a great night out & ate very nice food, They had a live band that took requests & that added to night which made it great also the service was good.If your in singapore with your family visit Hard Rock Cafe.
3
Average food nothing special and certainly wasn't a cheap eat most of the meals were good but daughter s chicken was dry ,would of been nice if the waiting staff had asked if all was well with the meal 
4
Another fab Hardrock restaurant, live music, great atmosphere. Food standard Hardrock fare, burger and chips all round
5
My husband and I took our kids (17, 14 & 5) to their first Hardrock Cafe experience tonight and it was flawless. From the moment we walked in and were greeted at the door by lovely staff we felt welcome. The live band was fantastic and we sang and grooved with them throughout their set. The waitstaff were friendly, helpful and attentive and the food was really good! Thanks for a great night out, Hardrock Singapore! We will definitely be back to visit again
4
Came for a weekday lunch birthday celebration where they were having great value lunch sets. The staff were really helpful with the celebrations too.
5
Food was still yummy after all these years. Consistent quality of food, good service, ambiance and our dinner ended on a high note - Jive Talkin 'live' performance was awesome.
5
Turned out better than expected. Nice ambience, awesome food, loved the ribs especially, and good service!
4
Very enjoyable place to be. Great sortiment of things you can buy. Restaurant looked nice and interesting.
5
Better to make a reservation, but they are very flexible. Had a live band the day we visited and the combination of ribs and music is heaven.

My family and I visited the Hard Rock Cafe as a treat due to it being Christmas Eve. We have been to many other Hard Rock cafes around the world, but sadly this was one of the worst.On arrival we were greeted politely by the staff, however after this things went downhill.The decor is somewhat dated unlike many other cafes in the chain. We ordered the nachos as a starter (which were actually the best we had had) however before we had even got half way through the starter we were given our main. All three of us had burgers and all three were absolutely swimming in grease! They were very disappointing! The staff were tentative but too much so, you could tell they were trying to gain tips, to the point where you just wanted to be left alone to eat your meal!Once my wife had finished her meal, they immediately took her plate away which we found very rude! And they almost seemed in a rush to get rid of you.Overall a very disappointing visit and we shall not be returning for a second visit. There are better places with a nicer atmosphere in Singapore and for a more reasonable price
4
We visited Hard Rock with my elderly Mother recently when we were in Singapore. The lunch menu we chose had soup, mains and a sweet dish for a reasonable price. Mum was surprised she knew many of the bands in the videos and who the owners of the guitars on display were.The staff were friendly and polite - the toilets were lovely and clean. I thought the young girl in the gift shop must have had OCD as she fussed about folding every T-Shirt in the store!Was a lovely way to spend time with Mum and hubby!
4
It is like most Hard Rocks (loud, American style food, and rock oriented), but this one also has a Singapore/Asian flair that makes it a bit nicer than most. They also have a Seafood Char Kow Yeou (might have mispelled that) that is top notch. Just a couple of steps off busy Orchard Road
4
I like this Hard Rock caffe because the music is not very laud ( you can have a nice conversation), live music is soft and engaging, food i very good - they have asian food as well. The only downside is that this restaurant is not cheap..
4
Love the place. A bit dated but hey it's HRC! Prefer it to the hotel at Sentosa. Never fails to bring my overseas guest to dine here. The food is great, the portion is reasonable and the service is excellent. The music is not too loud to drown any decent conversation and pretty good selection too. Highly recommended.
4
Second time here. Great atmosphere and the service is very good. Had the wings can recommend them very tangy.
4
Great service at the Hard Rock Cafe Singapore. Free soft drink refills.
Lovely food and good live background music. Food portions are very large.
Pleasant place for an evening meal.
Highly recommend.
2
I liked the convenient location, the not-too-loud volume of music and the enthusiasm of the service staff. The food, however, is poor. I had truly the worst fish & chips I ever had. Avoid it.
4
came for dinner with the wifey. service is good as usual by hrc standards. dishes were tasty and acceptable. made a mistake by coming on a wednesday night, the band only played up to around 10pm++ that day. found out that different bands perform nightly with different timings. nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves
4
I went to the Hard Rock off of Orchard, on Cuscaden Road. There is another one on Sentosa Island and at the airport. Hard Rocks are pretty much the same all over, you know what to expect and I collect pins, so of course I had to come here while in Singapore. You usually get pretty quick service at Hard Rock and the Singapore Cafe was no exception. I ordered the chicken caesar salad ( you can substitute shrimp or salmon instead of chicken for addtional cost) It was good, healthy and filling. Hard Rocks always have a decent cocktail selection. All in all, pretty good place
3
Couldn't believe that a Hard Rock Cafe doesn't have the standard milkshake.Was the only let down.Service was prompt and friendly.Food was also good for a HRC as they can be a little hit and missthere was a live band with a good atmosphere going
3
I'm pretty familiar with Hard Rock's standards and will often seek out a Cafe when I'm travelling for an occasional burger relapse. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the quality of dishes I was familiar with here in Singapore. Nothing wrong whatsoever with the service or the atmosphere - but I thought the cooking of my dishes was poor and obviously Hard Rock isn't cheap at the best of times, especially in Singapore
5
The service provided by our table server, Jeslyn was really astounding and perfect! The service is great, speedy, and exceeded my expectations by giving good recommendations! She did a great job indeed. Best arrangements for our anniversary dinner ever. I will definitely visit her and this lovely place next time. Well day spent with this energetic, lovely and charming girl. Hope to see you soon, Jeslyn. All the best and keep rocking! I love Hard Rock Cafe Singapore
4
Haven't seen a Hard Rock Cafe in awhile. This one is very small but the food was good. The employees were friendly and spent quite a bit of time chatting with us. They have amateur singers performing on Sundays, the talent wasn't that great the evening we were there but it is nice that The Hard Rock offers them that opportunity
3
Pros :1. Ambiance2. Very friendly staff3. Good taste of food and drinksCons :1. If the price can be 10% less then today -- will be perfect2. Portion of food could be smaller too as current is hella BIG3. More variety of food and drink in the list please... Too little to choose fro
4
A good place for a Beer with friends or family... The dinner spread was mainly dominated by American cuisine....
4
I stopped in for a beer on a very hot Singapore day.
They were showcasing French beers when I vivited.
The barman I dealt with (a Filipino gent) was friendly and very efficient
3
The food was acceptable and as usual the service made the meal. All staff very friendly and attentive. Shop very restricted in their range of items
4
The usual HRC great music and memorabilia, good food and drink...souvenir shoppe for that nice overpriced t-shirts. Add to my list of HRCs from Amsterdam to Los Cabos, Berlin to the Caymans, Paris to Pattaya, Miami to Bali and Cancun to Kota Kinabalu...and the newest , Vientiane Laos
5
If you're visiting singapore and are in the city looking for a hearty meal while sipping on your favorite cocktail, hard rock cafe (HRC) is the place to be. Menu has both western and Asian choices. A live band is on, certain nights of the week, so give them a call to enquire if you enjoy unwinding to some fine jamming by local bands. Of course, open-mic nights are on Thursdays and Sundays as of August 2016. So unleash your inner Celine Dions or John Legends (or maybe even Freddie Mercury) and go on down with your friends for a fun time at HRC. Enjoy ✌
3
As far as hard rocks go, this one was pretty typical. The local Singaporean food was good and the atmosphere is what you would expect from a hard rock. The crowd ranges from early 30s to late 40s set. All in all it was oka
4
Firstly, the shop, small but rammed with new styles I've not seen elsewhere. Excellent customer service from Diana (yes I asked her name) & as we shopped first we got a 10% voucher for restaurant food & drinks.. Secondly, the place has obviously had a revamp, modernised decor & massive great quality screens playing various videos & also a backdrop to the 2 great live singer who came on stage at 9pm (not bad for a Monday night) Thirdly.. food & drinks great & unusual for a Hard Rock you get to see the chefs in action.. (even better as the discount made the cost reasonable).. we intended to pop in for a quick bite to eat & a drink each, but with the singers & the nice decor, we stayed lots longer than anticipated & didn't get to go anywhere else except our hotel & sleep.. Enjoy.
4
The food here was excellent - Mac chicken and cheese, and the classic burger were both great. The staff were very good, as was the atmosphere. It's an expensive Hard Rock by Asian standards, but I guess that's Singapore! The shop was pretty averagely priced
2
Visited here out of curiosity as have been going to HRC for decades. Maybe all HRC's have radically changed but my experience was awful. Plates not cleared away, very average food (had heavy metal wings - clearly out of a bag)... really disappointed. Plus it was expensive!
3
Visited the the newly renovated Hard Rock cafe at Cuscaden Road with a friend last Friday. The burgers, margaritas and service was great as usual but the new atmosphere seemed a bit too "sensitized" . Maybe because we were given a table upstairs away from the "action" area downstairs. A few young children playing/running around didn't help
4
Stopped for a quick lunch, the food was as good as any other hard rock we visited around the globe. We shared the hickory ribs with some potato skins and barbecue wings . Service was very friendly and happy.
4
They are doing well for a restaurant that has been around for some time. The house was almost full, mostly for a dinner show of a popular local comedian. Be warned, food portion are huge. Atmosphere was great and service was excellent!
3
Pretty much like most Hard Rock's hard to get excited about. This location actually has some nice artifacts.
4
The food was fantastic, if a little expensive (even for Hard Rock). Would be nice to have receive a discount at the shop if you have dinner at the cafe...Legendary burger was amazing, and very big. Unlimited ice tea was also great.Service was excellent, as was the atmosphere.
3
I had been in India for a week had a few hours between flights in Singapore and thought Hard Rock was the perfect meal.It sort of was. Menu was okay but nothing really to grab you. Whilst restaurant was maybe 25% table occupancy, service was incredibly slow. Made a mockery of the service promise made when being greeted!Highlight was choc shake, low light zee burger
4
As with all hard rock cafes you pretty know what your getting, large group of us decided to go here last minute and have to say really enjoyed the experience. Great music and videos, good food and good choice of beers with very friendly and helpful staffThe restaurant is has plenty of space and good atmosphere
5
We had lunch today at Hard Rock Cafe. It's always a go-to place if you want a decent hamburger. Food quality and service is always good and consistent. Not many restaurants can deliver this year after year. So kudos to Hard Rock Cafe's management team.But something different happened on this visit. My friend ordered a cappuccino and what was served didn't have the milk froth topping and was quite flat. Looked more like normal coffee. When we asked the serving staff, she informed us that this was how the coffee machine they had made it. She could see the disappointment on my friend's face and quickly removed the cappuccino. Within minutes she was back with a proper cappuccino that she had made herself.Then, I did something silly. I tipped over my half drunk latte and messed up the table and floor. The staff were there real quick to clean up the mess. Then, to put me at my ease they served me a fresh latte. That's what I call going beyond to make the customer special.Well done guys. Thank you and keep up the good work
3
We had an early dinner here, since we were leaving the city that night. It was a long walk to the Hard Rock Cafe. It's located in a strange place. Anyway, we weren't the only ones inside. Staff looked bored and there wasn't a great atmosphere. The shop wasn't too much either. We just bought the shirt we always get and that was it. Food is always great. We had what we usually have...burgers and pulled chicken. And in this case we also had the satay. I heard that they renovated the restaurant, so hopefully it will be more inviting. We would go there anyway, since we always check out the Hard Rock Cafe wherever we are
3
Had a really nice night here with some mates. Some cracking food and awesome ribs which we shared. The vibe was really good and enjoyed the food but the service was a let down.
2
I wanted to go here, but was both surprised and disappointed at the location. A long way out of the main city area, and ended up catching a taxi there and back. Small, almost pokey little shop. I think the staff were bored and tried to mess me about with the t-shirt I bought. They deliberately put the wrong size in the bag and started giggling - but I spotted what they did and double-checked the size and got them to rectify it. I was the only customer there at the time. Not a particularly welcoming store, and certainly wouldn't go out of my way to return. Very drab end of town
4
Dinner and a couple of beers.Enjoyed chilling watching the awesome music videos. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Food was great. I will be going back. Oh yeah had to get a tee shirt 🙂
5
They've got the formula down! 8PM and the even the volume was very reasonable (or my hearing is getting bad). Nice table near the big screen TV. Good tunes, good food, good service.
Friday night rocks!
4
Great place to visit. Cocktails were the best and staff friendly. Highly recommended. Charies and Siong made the best Singapore Sling and must try their signature cocktail. We will be back. Fantastic.
4
I visited with my family yesterday for the lunch after See aquarium in Senthosa. The staff was co operative and guided us to select the food as we are new to many local menu. I recommend hard rock cafe to all of you
4
Visited on the 70th birthday of Freddie and was a tad disappointed that there was nothing going on. Still ordered food which was more than adequate and neither of us could eat it all as it was a biggish meal, so don't order starters unless you're very hungry! Visited the shop which was quite well stocked and purchased a couple of pin badges and was very happy about the Freddie 70 one! All the staff were extremely friendly. 
4
Late night dinner at the HRC, loved the atmosphere and staff very good however the best was both the food and drinks were terrific. Excellent nigh
1
Never again.The waiter stood in close proximity to us at all times.As soon as our meal came and my first mouthfull was not even fully consumed i was asked if i liked my meal.The meal itself was rather average for the price you pay. Extremely disappointed
4
Finished the rides at Universal around 7:30pm and wanted a quick bite to eat. The staff are very friendly and we were served right away. The food came very quickly and was all cooked well. The menu is the standard Hard Rock fair. Be prepared to pay a bit more for the location.
4
A group of friends visited on a Friday night at about 11.30pm but was surprised to be told that the place is closing at Midnight! After some considerations on whether we should still have drinks at the HRC, another staff then came to tell us that they are not closing at midnight after all.. It really doesn't make sense for HRC to close so early on a Friday night! On top of that, we were told up front that there is also no live band. Not that i was there for the live band, but it just felt that the staff didn't even want us inside. Ordered a bottle for the whole group of us and the rockers were really nice to help us pour our drinks and service was really good, unlike what happened at the door.As midnight approached, there were still many guests around and no one was being chased out. So i am still wondering why did they tell us they were closing at midnight in the first place, it really didn't feel good. Please look into this.After the drinks, most of us left for the club, but one of my friend got really sick and was puking outside HRC near the stairs. I just wanted to give compliments to Prem who came out to ensure that we were all ok. He even offered my friend water and stayed with us for a bit to ensure that we were all good. He really demonstrated great care and the service standards that i expect from Hard Rock. Love All, Serve All. Thank you Prem

I have not been here in over a decade. The place is currently undergoing renovations, lunch was being served downstairs whilst the mezzanine was still closed for renovation. We walked into a near empty place with only a few tables filled. However, the place did fill up to about half full by the time we left. I am not sure if the lack of patrons was due to the public perception that it was still closed for renovations, perhaps the restaurant needs better marketing to update customers that it's full service on the main floor now?Service was good, we were greeted by everyone once we walked through the door, all the way to our seats. The staff were very attentive, introducing themselves, serving the drinks and food quickly. They were also quite responsive, they were always nearby, on hand to serve us whenever we needed anything. They were also quite chatty and friendly.Food wise, The menu was extensive. Surprisingly there was an Asian menu but seriously, who would go to Hard Rock Cafe to eat char kway teow?My children had the kids' meal. The food was ok but I was disappointed with the drinks' option. Surely you could offer more than just Sprite or Coke for the children? Our kids don't drink soft drinks, so I requested for options. However, the staff could only recommend milk for no extra charge, if we wanted orange juice, we would need to pay an extra $6 each. It would be nice if management could offer alternatives like apple/orange juice or milo, we are not asking for freshly squeezed options, even packet juice would be better than soft, fizzy and sugary drinks? My son's chicken tenders were served with fries, my daughter's burger was a small burger with fries. They said that the tenders and burger tasted great but the fries were soft. I would also recommend if they could consider adding a healthier side portion of coleslaw or green peas to the dishes? The adult portions at least had coleslaw but the kids had nothing but deep fried food.We ordered a Caesar salad and a duo combo for their ribs and beef brisket. The Caesar salad was a surprisingly small serving, with lettuce, some shavings of cheese and huge croutons. The duo combo was much better, the ribs were melting off the bone, very good, and the beef brisket was tender. These were served with a small bowl of beans and coleslaw. However, the fries were, again, soft.We ordered long island tea and mojitos. No complaints about the drinks, they were pretty good.Music was not what it used to be. They were playing music videos on the TV screens but other than the 1 video by Rihanna, 1 video by REM and 1 video by INXS, I did not recognise a single other single/group. And I was there for over an hour. They used to play more popular songs which the patrons could relate to but no longer. It's sad
4
Have always enjoyed going here, especially Friday or Saturday evening. Usually a good band playing those evenings, food is typical Hard Rock fair prices are expensive but then Singapore is expensive, but always a good vibe.
5
It took us a while to reach here after walking for miles from our hotel down orchard road but it was worth the wait. Food was lovely and the service was very good too
3
You can trust the Hard Rock Cafe to provide food which you know and trust. We were looking for a quick meal and selected the cafe. It some years since we last visited; the place has certainly dated. However the food did not disappoint, and the service was efficient and friendly
3
Bit of a family tradition to go to Hard Rock wherever we are as none in NZ where we live. So been to a few now. This one disappointing. Very little Hard a Rock atmosphere, staff npjust going through the motions, none of that high on loving my job vibe that is such a feature of other HRs. Food average, long wait for it, and all mains brought out at different times, which meant one almost finished e all meals served. If number person had waited for all meals to be served it would have been cold.
1
This was my worst HRC experience anywhere. Currently the cafe is being upgraded so The food was being served on the mezzanine floor, quite a small space, circa 10 tables and almost a member of staff per table. This was oppressive, as soon you put your cutlery down the plate was whisked away. As part of the table order we had 2 burgers which were at best undercooked, cold and raw. These were returned to the kitchen and new ones cooked, supposedly well done, still very red inside. Manager was very apologetic and removed these from the bill and gave us a free drink, but this did not make up for the Poor experienc

Shame about this Hardrock ..poor atmosphere, build on need of a major refurbishment, food kind of good...but come on Hardrock this one is poor ...no bad either.............. X
2
Went for lunch with friends was looking forward to this as it had always been a favourite in Sing. First thing is downstairs completely closed lunch was only available in a small upstairs room which was probably an overflow bar normally. In spite of large number of staff took a while to get an order in they just gathered around the bar not doing much. We ordered and food came but I think it had a long journey from the kitchen and was at best warm. Part of the experience is checking out the memorabilia but there wasn't really any. The only thing hard rock was the (high) prices which seemed a bit off when the whole experience was not on offer. They had a sign saying 85 days until completion I would stay away until then and then I would reconoitre before eating
4
The service was great- food arrived in good time and we didn't feel rushed even though it was getting busy. The food itself was standard Hard Rock fair, although with a Singaporean twist here and there. The only thing that let it down was the state of the room- seemed a bit tired and in need of some refurbishment
5
In orchid road, with the american vibe (a band was playing the night I visited) and BLT kind of food. Closes a bit early at night, prices are fair and service is quick and good. Recommended

Located on the outskirts of Singapore, the Hard Rock Cafe-Orchard Road, is one of two Hard Rock Cafe’s in Singapore. The exterior is hard to miss with the huge sign and 50’s era car mounted high above that are symbolic of Hard Rock’s the world over. There is the standard souvenir/apparel shop outside. The inside is smaller than many Hard Rocks but the usual ambiance is there with the decor. The bar is a huge keyboard. I only stopped for a Mai Tai and some shopping. The Mai Tai was very different than any I”ve ever had, but refreshing and delicious on a hot and humid day
5
We had our anniversary dinner at Hard Rock Singapore. The staff were very friendly and hospitable. The meals were fantastic, very abundant and fresh. Highly recommend.
4
It is a must have in my list each time I'm in Singapore. This branch made the best pulled pork in the city. If you're in Singapore, please head down to HRC at Orchard Road. Unfortunately - HR needs to produce more pins for Singapore. They don't have any new ones since last year. As a pin collector, this is 'meh'. So heads up pin collectors.
5
After a long day at work we decided to have a meal, some drinks and listen to the music. It was very busy when we arrived but still got a table in the front near the band. I had a caesar salad and the heavy metal wing. Love them wings. All food came in a timely manner. Ordered ice tea with the meal and the free refills were immediate. Then switched to something a little better and never had an empty glass. The staff were very fast with our orders even though the place was crowded. The band this night was really good. They had a great interaction with the crowd
5
This Hard Rock Café is easier to find than most. Had a burger and it was really good. Bought a couple of t-shirts as souvenirs. There is not as much memorabilia on the walls as in many Hard Rocks, but it is nonetheless a fun place to visit

We,ve been to many Hard Rock cafes , this one stands up to the rest, service was excellent, food pretty good, prices not bad, would go again
3
The staff and food were great. Typical Hard Rock. The restaurant lacks a bit of HRC character and excitement that most HRC's around the world posses.However, the beer was cold and the Legendary burger was legendary!

A few of us couples had a nite out at Hard Rock Singapore, Cuscaden Road. I took the opportunity to surprise my wife (her birthday) with a solo dance. Lisha was absolutely helpful and sweet in accommpdating the plan....getting in touch with DJ Nesh to download Shy Guy by Diana King, arranging the sundae and candles, showing me the secret passage to the dance floor so my wife could not see me moving there. Thanks to our server Boco (you the man !!) for even asking us whether we needed to expand tables and for bringing out the sundae. The Hard Rock crowd was a ruckus and everyone had a rocking good time. Thanks for the memories Hard Rock, Lisha, Boco and not forgetting the resident band Jive Talking !!

My wife and I visit every Hard Rock Cafes we can, all over the world, and I'm sorry to say this one did not live up to the usual standard.While it looked like a Hard Rock, and the menu was Hard Rock & the servers were dressed in Hard Rock gear, the place lacked the pizzaz and the feel of a Hard Rock. The waiters seemed disinterested and the food was only mediocre - it just wasn't up to the standard we are used too. The whole place just felt a bit "off"It was also expensive - I mean really expensive, I know Singapore can be a bit pricey for alcohol but the mains were the dearest we've ever seen and it just does not represent the same value for money as other Hard Rocks throughout the world - and we've been to plenty
3
Music was fine. Service Very slow to get drinks. Restrooms on second floor- not easily accessible. No help in store
4
We came here for a business lunch. Everything is the same with Hard rock everywhere and it has never changed since the last decade that i have visited. The place is quite worn out and i think it needs renovation. The food is still good and yummy. The service is really good. Our staff is so friendly and attentive
4
Just what you would expect, American food, live music. Memorabilia everywhere and very expensive but I still like it so 4 stars.
4
the location is in orchard road, just opposite most of hoponhopoff and public transport buses. staff was friendly and accommodating, want too crowded when we went with our kids for lunch at 2, they had fun exploring the atmosphere.
4
This cafe is located just steps outside Orchard road and truly has an impressive entrance! Food and drinks are like in every other cafe of this chain.
4
Eating on Orchard Road always presents the challenge of sorting through the tourist orientated, over priced offerings.Hard Rock Cafe is a good safe choice. The clientelle is very mixed and the atmosphere is friendly if a little noisy. We had a NY Strip and grilled salmon which were both well cooked, promptly served and quite tasty. The servings are reasonably large but we did manage to share a mud pie between the 2 of us for dessert and that was also good
4
Only just arrived in Singapore and was looking for some where to eat which would cater for the whole family. Decided we would give Hard Rock a go as the one in Fiji was really good.Food was really good. Try the ribs they are superb. The service was good to the extreme of being over keen. The atmosphere was a little lacking. It seemed like get you in and fed then out. Overall experience good
3
My friend wanted to go here as she likes to buy Hard Rock Cafe memorabilia whenever she visits a new restaurant around the world! We arrived just on 12 noon so it wasn't very busy and we were seated very promptly and the food didn't take too long to be served. I didn't feel like western/American food so chose the Nasi Goreng. Think it was a special and not on the usual menu. The service was good but it took time to get the server's attention when we wanted another drink. Considering it wasn't very busy, service could've been a little better. Having said that, the food was nice enough and we enjoyed the atmosphere
3
Quite noisy, as you would expect, but that didn't detract from our meal, in fact the music was good. The food was good, cooked well and served pretty swiftly even though it was quite busy. The service was good, but occasionally when you did want something else it was difficult to get the attention of the staff. We would go back, but with so many other restaurants within a short walk, is it relying on it's name too much
3
Not so new place, lived time shows there. Food was pretty good. There were some kind of presentation going on, and noise of that was not so nice to have. We were there at lunch time, so it could be better place at night and evenings. Easy to access by walking Orchard road.
4
2nd visit of the week as it feels like a home away from home. Staff are excellent and remembered me from previous visit asking if I would like the same drink as before. A touch of excellence that will ensure I head back before I head home. The food was excellent (fajitas) and the smoothie sublime. The only reason for not 5 stars is that it took 20 minutes to get a glass of iced water despite getting my other drinks. It wasn't enough to upset the meal though. Try the "Grilled Chicken Arugula Salad", the fresh citrus and the candied pecans make it rise above a normal salad
4
Had dinner here on a Sunday night. There was live music which was great and added to the atmosphere (which was a bit bland otherwise). The menu is typical Hard Rock Cafe style and is quite expensive, even by Singapore standards. The service was attentive and food came out quickly. If you're a Hard Rock Cafe fan, you'll seek this place out to add to your list of the HRC's you've eaten at around the world.
4
We had lunch at he hard rock cafe after spending most of the day looking around Orchid road. we each had hamburgers and they were beautiful. very nice food, We didn't even worry about dinner afterwards. The staff were friendly and helpful
3
Based on other Hard Rock Cafe experiences wasn't impressed, paid a lot of money in the end but not great food. Service is good though.
3
Staff were more than helpful. Courteous and polite and will ensure that you feel comfortable during your visit. Free wifi is always appreciated. Good was just okay though.
4
I'd recommend that you try out their Jumbo Combo and it's sufficient for 2 people! :)
Their sauces are pretty good too!
@scottkjphotography
4
Food as always good and servers friendly and personable but atmosphere lacked. No band until 1030pm and music not appropriate for a Friday night - sadly a but dull. Servers were slow to clear dishes and to replenish drinks. We had a set menu but still VERY pricey compare dot other outlets
4
We are here after a long day at UniversalStudios.Four very tired people just wanted somewhere to sit in the cool and have something nice to eat.We were very surprised by the hard rock we have eaten in a number of different ones around the world and this was the first one we could sit and have a conversation it was fantastic. There was nice "rock" music but it wasn't over bearing. The room was quite dark but totally expected. We could see each other, the room, tables and other people so there was enough light.The service was excellent and very prompt we got our meals in about 20 minutes and drinks were fast.The meals were reasonably priced and a good size. Overall this was one of our best experiences in a Hard Rock Cafe
3
It isn't like a Hard Rock in Malaysia at all! People absolutely engrossed on what they are eating and having chat among friends. Very few locals, mostly tourists and some expatriates. No soul. Why? A Hard Rock is supposed to Rock. There was no band and I was told nothing except at the weekends. The reason - from the man behind the bar - even when there was a band only the staff enjoyed it. Strange place
4
Typical Hard Rock experience, good service, good food and a good staff. Odd note, this Hard Rock doesn't have a Local Legendary, instead they have Asian Cuisine, which is interesting, but not too bad. The food though is a bit more expensive than any other hard rock I've been too
4
We visited here early evening (around 6pm). Service was good, with the usual Hard Rock Cafe menu. Portion sizes were good, and my steak was cooked exactly as requested and the pepper sauce was very good. My wife ordered fish and chips, and the batter was crispy and the fish perfectly cooked and served with coleslaw. Staff were helpful and polite, but if they didn't know the answer to a question, our wait staff immediately found someone who did. There were several families with young children in at that time, and they seemed to be enjoying the food as much as we did
3
Service - Great!Drinks - cant go wrong with a diet Coke!Food - absolutely awful. I had the BBQ pulled Chicken - the chicken was worse than what I would give to my dogs ! My S-I-L had a chicken burger which was tasteless and that was pretty much the consensus of the remaining 4 meals 
4
The HRC in orchard road is good, the seating is excellent and its quite easy to locate. The food and drinks are great.
Value for money
4
The menu is almost the same to the one in KL. Acceptable taste, good food temperature, nice music video that brings out the mood. The waiter are so friendly and helpful.
5
This place has been here for 25+ years and still has the stained glass. I have nothing bad to see about this place. Staff 10, Food 10, Atmosphere 10, Collection 10, Location 10.
4
Popped in for a cold beer and lunch this afternoon.
Crab was nice and spicy and the nachos plentiful with a few cild beers to wash it down.
Background music was good and the service fantastic , keep it up.
2
Slow service, eventually took our order and drinks appeared some time later. My meal came out several minute before my husband. "Entertainment" was not rock music but a 'live' woman murdering love ballads, not what you go to hard rock for. Finally she finished the singing but no videos of music which we would expect. The only thing which saved the evening was the food
4
Just around the corner from our hotel, just popped in for a burger and chips and another tshirt to the collection. Have been to a lot better hrs cafs, this one was a bit run of the mill, nothing special to mention, service was on the ball and the food was okay. They have live music some nights and it seemed to be well used although we didn't go in the evening
4
First off have to say the food portions are massive I'm a big eater but struggled with size of portions food was great hot very tasty staff were great free refills on sodas and the sweets mmmmmm fantastic just need to adjust your belt after lol a must if you are in singapor
5
The HRC Singapore is tucked away off the NW end of Orchard Road but is easily recognised as you walk along the kerb. The decor is as rock & rock as you would expect & the ambient music excellent. After being met at the entrance we were efficientlu shown our table where menus were quickly presented to us. The specialty here is the Chilli Crab Dip, which was great with corn chips. We opted for the bruschetta as a second starter, which ably filled us up along with the crab dip. Wait staff were friendly & professional, & the premises well kept. Prices were above average which is usual for HRCs, but that was no surprise. I for one am ok with paying for a consistently good experience. The Rock Shop was located at the entrance to the cafe, & had a good collection of memorabilia available for purchase. Overall, I highly recommend you to visit this location
4
Had the legend burger & a few Tigers, was alone due to just arriving in SG for work, was made to feel welcome, burger was cooked med rare which was exactly how ordered. More of a restaurant than a bar vibe but nice just the same
4
When travelling through Asia the Hard Rock Cafe is always a place to visit. It is always consistant in both menu and in quality and the service staff are friendly, entusiastic and customer focused. Just remember that as an American restaurant the portion size is larger than usual, even the entree is large
4
Be careful: there are three Hard Rock Cafes in Singapore. That one is definitely the best-two floors, a lot of remarkable memorabilias, really worth watching. Staff-more than ok. Food and beverages-comparable to the others, so ok!
3
Straightforward and predictable which is what I wanted - burger and fries without a cray singapore price tag.
Excellent service
5
The family alwasy enjoys this place. Food portions are enormous, even the kids meals. Service is quick and friendly, music is always good and it's a fun night out. Great for birthday parties.
4
Good American style fayre in a Rock Cafe atmosphere. We had well prepared burgers and when they say the deserts are for sharing they mean it!!
4
Food is delicious, similar to most Hard Rock Cafes and service is awesome so kudos to the team here. Try the chili crab sauce with buns for a local Singaporean dish. There are live bands on certain days so check out the website for the schedule or give them a ring. Tips:You can get discount when dining here if you purchase some merchandize in the Rock Shop.The nearest MRT station to this outlet is Orchard MRT station on the red line, about 10-15 mins walk. For your information, there are 3 Hard Rock Cafes in Singapore along with a Hard Rock Hotel (Sentosa). The 3 are in Orchard (this), Changi Airport Terminal 3 and in Sentosa (near the hotel). In total, 4 Rock Shops for these that are interested in collecting Hard Rock merchandises, e.g pins or t shirts.If you think this review is helpful, please click on the "helpful" button. Keep on rockin

During a recent business trip to Singapore I decided to stop for lunch at the HR. As will all Hard Rocks world wide, you can beat the service. So friendly and helpful. The ribs were outstanding and not expensive. The HR Shop was well stocked and again, wonderful service. I'll be back
4
I collect shot glasses and when I travel, I make it a point to find Hard Rock. We didnt eat but the shop and restaurant are clean and friendly service. Its had just opened so we were able to walk around to look at the items
4
We have to visit Hard Rock where ever we go in the world!This isn't the largest we have been to but the staff were really friendly and it's the quickest we have ever been served! Although the restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived.It was nice to see a few local dishes on the menu! But the standard Hard Rock staples were there too
5
Took a friend to his first Hard Rock, Singapore of all places..It's my 36th so I know what to expect. Local band the Slings doing sound check while we ate an early dinner. Good food, good band! Picked up the obligatory shirts and pins and beat feet
4
Went for a walk on a warm November evening, found the HRC Singapore tucked 50 metres of the main "Orchard" road drag.As I am used to now was met by the staff with a genuine smile and "how are U sir" makes you feel welcome and special, people lovin what they do and sharing that with others... Quick look around the Rockshop and bought a magnet #28 for me, when I paid I was given a discount voucher for beer.So thought why not, that beer led to a burger that lead to a lovely couple hours talking with my server and having a relaxed dining experience.Not the biggest HRC in the World, not the most Pop, Rock, Music artefacts... BUT the staff make up for that, genuine guys! To me that's priceless.They even popped outside and took some photo's of me that's great service :-) Keep it up
5
Young lady who served my friend and I made our experience at the restaurant very special. Singapore slinger was very good.
4
15 Singapore $ bought me drink, soup, rack ribs, and desert that was extremely appetizing and filled every taste bud!! Fast, efficient, professional staff!
4
Always call into Hard Rock Cafe as we collect their jacket pins.Lovely staff and great service.The bar is a nice casual setting for a few beers.Air con is great on a hot day in Singapore:)))))
2
Came here specially for their Nachos but left disappointed. This dish has now been revamped and they have decided not to serve Nachos with salsa. I cannot imagine anyone serving nachos without salsa .... As a replacement they serve pickled tomato and on 2nd serving they charge. Double whammy
4
Business trip by myself, hungry at 9pm and this is just around the corner from my hotel. I haven't been to a Hard Rock anywhere in over ten years, and I decided to try it out. There was a 40 minute wait for a table, but no worries, I can eat at the bar. The bartender was wicked fast at everything and in no time I had a tall beer and then what turned out to be a very tasty 6-oz burger with piping-hot fries. And without asking, she also gave me mustard & catsup which sounds so simple, but can be a delay even back home. I was surprised- getting a good burger anywhere in Asia is a challenge. Good job, Hard Rock
3
Went here with my wife and we visit the hard rock in every city we visit. The Cocktails were very poor and I don't think think the barmaid had much of an idea on what she was doing... Other then that the food was good and there were some good acts playing however some were a little suicide inducing...
4
I like to visit Hard Rock locations while traveling.I was in Singapore for business and was able to visit this location on Cuscaden Road.I enjoyed walking around to check out the memorabilia. I sat at the bar and had a burger and beer. The staff was friendly
3
The food was pretty good but could use a bit more flavour (The fajitas) but other than that the portion size was big and with fresh ingredients. Service was a bit slow to be honest for an almost empty restaurant but they where very firendly atlest :) Good music and atmosphere as always though
1
I have been to at least a dozen Hard Rocks around the world and have never had a bad meal. This was the last night of a 12 day holiday to Lombok Indonesia. We stayed in Singapore for the night before we had an early flight the next day so played safe and had western food before the 14 hour flight.The food tasted fine at the time but by 2am I was on the toillet for most of the night. My girlfriend was then on the toilet from about 6am. It was a nightmare in the taxi to the airport and we were then both bad for the whole flight. Luckily the plane was quite empty so there were no queues for the toilet.My stomach still does not feel right and this is 2 days later.There was definitely a problem with the quality of the food, the storage, or the handling at this restaurant.Avoid this restaurant at all costs
5
we came to this restaurant celebrating my uncle's bdayand the steak was big, soft and yummy..the pork rib was soooo large and deliciosohahahhahahahand the hard rock crew was so warm and we sang the bday song together with all the other customerswhat a experienc
5
I went solo this time, usually it's a fun place for the kids. Music was good, wait-staff were attentive and quick and the food (brisket - awesome) is amazing. Well worth going to and will be going back again.
4
No matter where in the world we go - HRC is very consistent. This location is quite good. Excellent, friendly, attentive service. Good atmosphere. Had the ribs, jumbo combo...and all very good!
5
During my first visit to Singapore I was celebrating my birthday. We booked to have a meal at the Hard Rock Cafe on the evening of my birthday. I am not really into fuss, just something nice to mark the day, so I chose this venue as I have never eaten in this franchise and I wanted to buy myself a hard rock souvenir. Our table was booked for 8pm on a Tuesday evening. When we entered, we were greeted by polite friendly staff who showed us to our table. The restaurant was not particularly busy, but it may still be advisable to book in advance to prevent disappointment. We ordered cocktails from an extensive list, these took a little while to arrive, but one of the servers noticed this and brought over some water without being promoted. Our main server was a lovely, bubbly, happy girl called Hayley. She worked liked she loved her job. She took an interest in anyone she served and was great with the kids on an adjacent table. She even shared some stories of her recent time in Batam on holiday, so refreshing from some staff who really prefer minimal interaction with customers. Hayley is definitely an asset to this particular restaurant.We ordered starters of bruschetta and potato skins, which were vast portions. My Bruschetta was so fresh and tasty. For main course we had chicken fajitas and a medium beef burger with fries. All very filling and again very tasty. Could not manage any dessert. It was not a cheap meal about Â£40 sterling each, but in line with the brand and theme, so to be expected. It was nice as a treat for my birthday. Before we left Hayley brought over two branded pint glasses as gifts, which was a lovely touch.Would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
Stayed close to the Hard Rock Cafe and wanted to join just for a quick drink but it turned out to be a fantastic night out. Great life music and a cabaret show which goes with it. As everything is Singapore not the cheapest place to hand out but for sure worth the money.
5
The burgers are so nice I had the kids 3course meal and it was Devine Hard Rock Cafe is the best place ever
5
I was having lunch with a couple friends when a couple more friends came in. The staff member (Lisha) was so accommodating, she quickly got us a larger table and the additional guests their beverages and food. My friend is still raving about the spicy wing
4
This can be abit hard to find, as it's located at the end of Orchard Road but it's worth it. We stopped for a spot of lunch here (and for me to get the customary t-shirt), and there honey mustard chicken sandwich was superb (exceeded my expectations). It also has Sommersby cider on tap, though it is expensive
5
We have been to the Hard Rock Cafe in Edinburgh, London and Florida many times. This chain delivers every time. The Hard Rock Cafe Singapore is as you would expect with the choice of food you would expect. We were served quick and food was tasty and fresh. The cocktails were a little prices but typical for singapore.For my family it's always worth a visit
4
Service counts and that's why we enjoyed our meal at Hard Rock. Attentive and friendly and by far the best service we've had on our Singapore trip so far. The food is what you expect, but the chicken wings were delicious as were the milkshakes. Good for kiddies, relaxed dining experience and who doesn't like a good cocktail or two
4
Visited during out stay. First time was good as it was the weekend and quite busy. Second time not so much and the service both times was hit and miss with drink orders taking a long time to fill and staff being more interested in talking to one another than serving. Overall the food and drink were good but would expect better service for what you pay there.
2
This restaurant was as average as you can get. Nothing to write home about. Decor is as normal and starting to look dated. A bit pricey than other restaurants nearby
4
Standard HRC food, but still good. Great live music, efficient staff and interesting surroundings. Just a bit expensive. $160 for four of us, with no alcohol. I suppose it is Singapore but still, that is quite a lot.
3
The location was close to my hotel so I thought I would have some American fare after being in Singapore for over a week. Was a bit disappointed , service was good but the club sandwich I ordered was terrible. the chicken was so dry that it wasn't edible. I tried as it wasn't cheap but it was just too dry , so for the most part I ended up with a pricey BLT instead
3
Visited Hard Rock with some colleagues. The food is as expected. There is one thing on the menu that you do not find in UK (suprisingly) is Fish'n chips. And that is actually really good. If you visit on Sundays evenings, they have live music as well.
4
I like hard rock cafe, all rock cafe I tried I have ever found same good quality and very beautiful location. My favorite choice iss the cheesecake.Sometimes there is no rock music and I don't appreciate it. If you are a hard rock cafe you should not prouder video with pop singer.Keep on rocking in the free world
5
Yes, this is part of a chain, but it still has the best burger in town! And it's worth the extra couple of bucks just to have an amazing burger! Food is consistently good, of course, while waiters may seem apathetic and unenthusiastic. But oh well!
4
this place is like any other Hard Rock Cafe but they serve nice food as well, sometime waiting time is a bit long but once you are inside the place is great, nice food, nice music and is good to hang out few hours
4
Being a keen HRC fan, I was eager to come here for dinner, and as usual I wasn't disappointed. It has great atmosphere, really nice, cheery staff, and even a live band, which is always great to hear. The drinks did take a long time, and like most restaurants in Singapore, it's not cheap. But the food was great, filled me up completely, and the experience was just as enjoyable as any HRC I've been to
5
Been here so many times in the past 20 over years!I felt I have to visit once more to do a review. As usual, the food was great and the staff were friendly. Service was good too.We chose to go around 5pm to avoid the dinner crowd. Had a great meal! The smoked beef brisket sandwich was good. The classic brownie has always been wonderful!Must come if you are in Singapore
4
Nice food and some nice bands come to play in the evening.We had lunch there and i must say i was pleasantly surprised.In the daytime there is no live band but the music being played is pretty good rock :-)The price was ok
4
Went to Hard Rock Cafe with my wife as neither she or I have been to one before, we arrived and the staff were very friendly and welcoming! taken straight to a table. The atmosphere was lively with good music in the background. the menu has a good variety with lots of burgers to choose from (amongst other things). The food was brought to table very quick and was VERY tasty! The only downside we found was the food was on the pricey side and you will have to take into consideration the 10% service charge and GST which is another 10% which added more money to the bill (I guess that's the rules)
4
great location, American waitress (female) was outstanding for service, she did not have a name tag as I would have mentioned her.kids soft drinks are too expensive at $8.50 each, why not have them for free a the meals are not cheap. No need to slug the kids for drinks, adults drinks were not cheap, $16 for a cocktail or a pint of cider or beer, a little steep when you are having a meal as well.what they do not tell you is there is a 10% service fee + a 7% GST so basically add 20% to your bill, so an adult drink is $20 each.food was very good and speed of service was good, meal was $180 for 2 adults + 2 kids with 1 drink each and no sweets, great experience but to expensive for what the quality was
4
I always enjoy a night out at the Hard Rock Cafe! Good food and loads of fun, I try to go to one in every city I visit
4
great atmospherelive bandfamilies dining together with kidsoverall great experience.it gets busy on weekend night, so consider making a reservation
2
I visited a dozen of HRCs in different countries. Most of them multiple times. The one in Singapore is a disappointment and in no way comparable to others. After we were seated it took ages to order food. I wanted my burger medium well and it was not more than bloody. Our both meals were cold and we needed luck to place a second order for drinks because the staff were barely around. Also the interior did not convince me. I love HRC but I cannot recommend this one and I would not go their again
4
Food was good we had Asian dishes one lunchtime and American another and they were as many have stated, generous portions and tasty. We were in Rome last week and I think it was less expensive than here. Singapore is pricey! Today I Glass of Wine, 1 Margarita, Cobb Salad and a sprite.,Sin $ 80+....
4
You know what to expect from the Hard Rock franchise, so the only difference to measure is the service. The staff were really friendly, the food was great and quickly presented, and the place was spotless. A good visit which the family enjoyed
1
Arrived 17.15 place fairly quiet very hot with poor a/cPoor service waited 10 mins for drinks although bar very quiet and staff had lots of time to chat to each other. Singapore sling was to sweet with no alcohol taste. Unable to identify a specific waiter/waitress for the tableMashed potato lumpy. No-one asked how the meal was and then they had the cheek to charge 10% service charge. Expensive hamburger worst experience in a Hard Rock Caf
2
Service is vÃªr friendly. The food and drink comeback very fast. The quality of the food could have been better. Band playing but not very good. Probably visiting? The combination of not too good a meal and under party band, made us leave fast
3
Fantastic area, but inside the Bar very conjugated! Not enough space! Services are very poor! Should find something better than this to enjoy
5
You just simply cant go wrong with a Hard Rock Cafe! Great service, food and atmosphere. Enjoyed it and whenever I am in Singapore I pass by.
5
The food is delicious and very generous portion sizes. Make sure you are there when the live band a playing for a fun night out
4
Really enjoied to visit it . I have visited a lot of Hard Rock and in Singapore I have expected someting better. Fantastic food !!!HRC a guarantee !!!!!
2
The Hard Rock Cafe name sells itself. I've visited many cities around the United States and Asia, and you pretty much know what you're going to get with the atmosphere, food and service. Well the atmosphere is the same. The food is the same. But the service stinks! Somebody needs to teach the wait staff about serving in a restaurant. Once we ordered the drinks, they came quickly and then the food came. The waitress put our plates on the table and left, to laugh and joke with another wait staff. I had to get her attention and call her back to ask for condiments. When I had just put the last bite of my food in my mouth the waitress was there with her hand on my plate asking me if I was finished? My mouth was full with chewing my food and I was surprised to see her so soon. I really wasn't finished as I was going to help my wife finish her meal but since I couldn't answer she took the plate away. She should have asked if we wanted another drink instead as we were both finished with our first drink. By now I was ready to leave and was trying to get the waitress' attention so I can get the bill but couldn't. After several minutes I went to the bar and paid the bill. I will still visit the Hard Rock . . . but not here
4
I hit the hardrock for a few drinks after work one evening, and I again was happily seated at the bar where I downed a few Tigers.This was my second visit to HRC and the atmosphere was great, the bar staff are friendly and hold good conversation.Next time i'm in town i'll eat there, but this was a solo drinks visit and they get 2 thumbs up
4
My wife and I were on an Asia Holiday and planned to visit all HRC in each country which we did, which included 3 in Singapore.We had visited Sentosa earlier in the day and eventually found this one. We only had drinks and snacks which was all we needed after big lunch at HRC Sentosa. The night we went there was a really good band playing (from Hawaii) and we really enjoyed our time there.We walked there and found it quite difficult to find but we tapped into a wifi at a mall and used Google Maps to find location
4
We went there on a Monday night, hence was not at all happening, but you can never go wrong with Hard Rock Cafe. The food was good, service amazing and they really pamper you well. They have live music on Thursday night, which one should not miss . I have been told it is really good and rocking
3
Hard Rock Cafe Singapore located just off Orchard Road offers the usual selection of food, drinks and music in a relaxed informal setting. At times noisy when the music gets going - as you'd imagine!! Staff were helpful and the service was good. It was busy at the time I arrived so we were seated at the bar for ten minutes. I settled for ribs - bog standard but delicious never the less. Visited the shop on the way out and bought a badge as a sorvineer! Worth a visit
3
We've eaten in HRC's all over the world, but this one ranks with Gran Canaria as the most disappointing. The downmarket appearance of the outside continues all the way in. It looks years overdue for refurb. We agree with a previous reviewer who said the place looks "greasy". We were allowed into the closed upstairs to see the memorabilia and had to creep around and avoid using flash photography so we didn't wake the half dozen or so staff who were sprawled across the benches in the booths fast asleep. Stepping 100m outside of the Ferrari, Rolex and Cartier world of Orchard Road we expected better, much better.The lunch special was amazing value at S$15, but we chose this option as we'd have felt cheated of a HRC experience if we had eaten off the regular menu as we usually do.The servers were attentive and friendly, as were the ladies in the merch store

This Hard Rock is out in the boondocks in Singapore. The food was overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food provided If you don't have a car, it's a bit confusing to find
5
they didn't let us down ive ate in a few hard rocks now and it was as good as usual the staff got a little confused with our orders we thought wed end up with more meals or drinks but it was all very nice
5
This is a HRC, that I would recommend to any HRC goer and newby. Nice location, nice good food and very good lunchtime offers from 1200-300 - a set lunch menu, with free flow ice tea, a small soup, a main dish (4 to chose from) and a ball of ice-cream for only 15 SGD - that is good value for money. Evenings can be a bit noisy, but are really enjoyable as well. Sometimes they really have great live music as well!!!

As a regular traveller I collect hard rock memorabilia which started as a hobby during my early travels. The hard rock was not as good as many I have visited but certainly not the worst. It was however overpriced by both Singapore and HRC standards. The staff were a little too enthusiastic to clear the table actually removing my plate while I was still holding my food which is a first for me. I was unable to protest as I had my mouth still full of food .
5
We are Hard Rock Cafe enthusiasts. That being said we found Singapore's Hard Rock Cafe is doing everything right! Great service, great music just loud enough to be enjoyed but not to interfere with conversations, prices on par with other Singapore restaurants, EXCELLENT food (not so with the last HR Cafe visited) a manger who took an active roll on the floor, staff that seemed to enjoy working there and of course a lot of music memorabilia to explore. We had a great experience

Missing home in the USA on a Sunday evening, Hard Rock was exactly the place to go. The burger did not disappoint. The Crab dip is wonderful! There was a bonus of live music. The MC started the show by singing a song about a Carolina girl - Just what this home sick Carolina girl needed! Super friendly staff and good food - what more could you ask
3
Food was fantastic with friendly staff. Interior not as impressive as other Hard Rocks we have been to around the world. Tried to go Sunday night but an hour wait for a table so returned for an early dinner Monday. Had a burger and beer deal which was good value. Nachos to share as a starter never disappoints
1
We have visited Hard Rocks all over the world, and this one was on the list - what a let down!It was dark inside and quite dirty - the seats were greasy and there were very few diners inside. The menu was expensive compared to what I would have expected and the food was awful - we could barely eat it.Compared to the other Hard Rock cafes we have visited, this was really disappointing. To have the Hard Rock name associated with this place is shameful
3
I went to HRC to have a couple of drinks and show my fiancee the HRC Singapore.I never eat at a HRC in Asia (especially Singapore) because the local food is so good; why would I wand to eat frozen fries and western junk food from a formula menu when I can eat healthy, tasty and fully flavoured local fayre?I was prepared to have a few drinks and listen to the live band, however, I was greatly disappointed when I could not get a draught Tiger Beer; the beer of Singapore.Now, all I can say is the souvenir shop is the best part of HRC in Singapore
5
Warmly greeted on a busy Saturday evening by the host and by Lisha/Harden. I was able to print up my birthday entrée offer as I am a VIP member. Ordered a red wine and beer while waiting for our ribs to arrive. We enjoyed both very much. Had a look at the memorabilia and checked out the store. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was very comfortable, and all the staff was friendly and helpful. As it turned out I was sharing my birthday with another patron; we were asked to come to the stage where we each presented with a sundae. (With a candle) We were both treated to the singing of 'Happy Birthday' from all the staff. Overal, I had a great experience; made my day! Many thanks. Definitely a place I would come back to! We did have a chat with the staff; unfortunately, the liquor prices are steep, but all places in Singapore experience the same issue
5
I went to Hard Rock café with my gf and the food was awesome. To tip it off, the customer service provided by the waitress was extremely impressive. The waitress that served us, was very patient with us, she was very knowledgeable about the food there. She was very polite. And she sounded very professional
5
Kudos to Lisha n team for d consistency in food quality and taste...also gd job with d service staff for remembering us who ALWAYS orders Beef Fajitas with extra portion of cheese.
4
This restaurant is very nice, service is also nice live music will entertaining you always.
Overall it is a happening place, Worth to visit.
5
I'm a VIP Rewards member so I had to visit ad get a pin. I love that this location, like a few other HRC locations it also sells local food. The service was fantastic and friendly and they had free wifi. The HRC is in the heart of the Singapore shopping are of Orchard Street. I was surprised it was very easy to find, because of the heat I think its better if you cut through the Forum Mall Shoppe
4
Some of the wall art was a bit dated and damaged but it had a vibrant Friday Night atmosphere and the Burger i thought was quite expensive but absolutely delicious which completely justified the expense
1
Have you been to a Hard Rock Cafe lately? Remember how cool they were back in the day? Picture and old rocker on the stage singing their one hit wonder. The HRC in Singapore was pitiful. The ambiance was dated, the food was horrible and the service was so-so. Bad 40 year old video's and music added to the disappointment I experienced. I have just visited my last Hard Rock Café. You have been warned about this location
2
The food was just okWe were expecting a better looking location and ambience Only reason we went here was to get a decent burger and didnt really get one Service was average

We are U.S. expats living in Singapore and have visited many HRC's around the world. When the kids are homesick and longing for American-style comfort food, we usually visit a chain like HRC. Of the 3 locations in Singapore (the other two are on Sentosa Island and at Changi airport) this is our favorite. It is located about 10 minutes' walk from our condo. Having been here 3 or 4 times in as many months, I can say we have always had a good waiter/waitress who was attentive to our needs. Our son has food allergies (egg, dairy, nuts) and the staff have always been able to accommodate his dietary restrictions...our experience with the HRC chain worldwide has been very positive in this regard. If you've been to a HRC before, then you understand the concept and design/decor of the restaurant as well as the typical fare offered on the menu. You will also find some local dishes sprinkled throughout if you want to try something different. We'll be back again for sure
4
I visited a few other Hard Rock Cafes around the world and this one lived up to the standard of the others. Conveniently located a few minutes walk from our hotel (just off Orchard Road), the menu offers a filling selection of mouth watering food and the live music added an interesting atmosphere to the usual restaurant.The staff were polite and helpful.The main courses are reasonably priced for the portion sizes, the desserts are a little pricey but too good to miss.The décor and relatively loud rock & roll music (live on certain nights) gives you a very different dinning experience
4
Hard Rock Cafe's are usually pretty good wherever you go in the world and this place does not disappoint. Everything up to the usual standard and you will not be robbed as prices are reasonable. We ate there on a Saturday night and they had a live band, not the best we have ever heard but not bad really.Only disappointment was that the server will walk off with your credit card for a while, something that does not happen where we come from. There is no facility to bring a card reader to your table.In a high tech city this should be addressed
3
we should have noticed when we went in - hardly anyone there on a Tuesday evening. food was over-priced, and very average. our teenage kids loved the gigantic burgers but food was lukewarm, chips not good; my meal was disappointing. paid over the top for a margarita that was terrible (you would expect more). the place was empty but service was substandard. had to keep asking for things. would not go back.
5
Good service, drinks, A/C'd environment to relax after walking the hot shopping strip. Lot's of Americans popping in and out.
I'm told the area gets a little tranny style weird at night, but didn't stick around to see those sights.
3
I have visited Hard Rock Cafes all around the world so know what to expect.This one however fell short. One big room with average service and expensive (for Singapore) food which was OK at best.The cafe seemed to be geared more towards live music with a large stage front and centre however on the night i visited there was no live music so the atmosphere was lacking.So an OK meal with OK service but I am not in a rush to return
4
In previous 23 visits to the area had never been to this restaurant. The place was busy and noisy with a live band but the waitress found me a quiet table and I had an exemption ally nice burger and ice cream dessert. Not as expensive as I thought it might be. Staying on your own on orchard road, a nice change
4
I'm a "collector" of Hard Rock Cafes & wherever I go in the world I visit the local one - if there is one of course!! Singapore Hard Rock is pretty much the same as all the others in many way - menu, cocktails menu etc but the biggest difference is the staff. Staff in Singapore really make the atmosphere. They're friendly & very efficient & all look like they're thoroughly enjoying their jobs.An on site shop sells genuine Hard Rock merchandise & is well worth a browse
3
Slow service and the quality of food do not justify the big prices.My favorite dish is Fajita Beef , eat it every time when I meet in my travels this chain of restaurants. A lot of onion in my plate and less beef comparing with any other HR restaurant where we ate. Salmon fillet almost blue, only the Sling save the reputation
5
Made a special visit to this HRC in Singapore as I had visited before a few years before and had a great evening.Great food was served. Cold drinks served.Staff very friendly and jovial.Quick service. Live band was playing and there were a few larger parties in which gave the restaurant a very lively feel.Recommended
2
I visited the Hard Rock Cafe and I have a nut allergy. On the menu, there is a small cross icon which is placed next to items containing nuts. I ordered a Veggie Leggie burger, which didnt have an allergy symbol next to it...two bites in and I felt sick. Turns out the burger contains nuts! The staff were very apologetic which i appreciate as it is not their fault, but I think its more of the companies issue as the menu was not appropriately marked! If this had not happened, I would have given this restaurant a better rating. On the plus side I didnt have to pay for my meal, thank god as I ended up throwing it all up! All in all I understand it isnt the workers fault, more of a menu missprint issue but I think it needs to be fixed before others get sick from it
4
Nothing special, but Hard Rock Cafe is HRC! We ate two burgers and drink few drinks. Stuff was great, only minus was the A/C which was too cold and then four star
4
We went for dinner with friends on a Monday night - they had local talent playing. The atmosphere is good as you would expect, the meals were mixed, there were some nice meals according to the other guests - mine was the plain burger- they were kind enough to ask how i liked my burger - i said medium to well done - it came out medium to raw.All in all a good night. We were fortunate enough to have a Perth boy - Trent Jean play - an exceptional guitarist and singer - Im from Perth so ill have to keep an eye out
2
We enjoyed a great evening here year 2010 and wanted to do it again. But..It really was a disappointment, the menus were really poor, the service was so and so and they didn't want to TaKe reservations although the restaurant wasn't even ful
5
It's a ritual for my family and I to dine at this cafe for all kinds of gatherings. When friends visit from overseas, this place is a must. Awesome food, friendliest service crew, happiest ambience, great music and amazing live band. Thank you Lisha, the most friendliest Opns Manager. Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year 2015.
4
Having been to Sentosa's Hard Rock last month, I thought I give the main one a try. To be honest, this Hard Rock experience was fantastic but having been pampered crazy by the branch in Sentosa, I would rate my dining experience here as 4.5 bubbles out of 5, but since it is impossible to give a 1/2 star rating on TripAdvisor & it would be unfair to put them on the same rating as Sentosa Hard Rock, the only option is 4 bubbles.That said, this is still a great place to bring family & friends to
4
Singapore Hard Rock Cafe not only has excellent burgers but also a real Texan shredder meat pork meal. If you close your eyes you are other their. One of my favorite Hard Rock Cafe. It was crowed so needed to wait a bit
4
They've got the menu that fit my kids' taste buds especially the fajitas, gorgeous steaks and of course the nachos. Something we would do every once in a while. Great for birthday parties too
3
We always visit the Hard Rock Cafe when we are on holiday. We got lost trying to find it as it is a few streets off orchard road. When we arrived we were told there was a 20 min wait for tables. I have a HRC rewards card which i presented and we had the next available table within 10 mins.The food was good as a vegetarian i can only have the burger which gets a bit boring but i still enjoyed it. Service was a bit slower here than other HRC we have visited. We had a few mocktails with dinner and then a few cocktails. Was a bit expensive but that's HRC for you
3
This was the 8th Hard Rock we had been too and the most expensive (comparison to be made with the US, Bali, Hong Kong, Ireland). Food and service were okay. Location of this Hard Rock is ridiculous, its stuck in a back street off Orchard Road
3
What has happened to the Hardrock, not just in Singapore. In this instance we ordered burgers and they looked very simple. Is this the healthy option. My burger in a bun with some frozen chips and no garnish whatsoever was a horrid texture and tasteless. My husbands and sons were slightly better as they had ordered burger with everything on it but once again no garnish, just some frozen chips that were not well cooked. Enjoyed the live band but was made to feel uncomfortable by the staff towards the end as they obviously wanted to go home and we were still listening to the band who had another few songs to play. They were switching lights on and off shining them on our table, banging furniture and moving chairs and being generally obvious. Poor show
5
Always try and visit a Hard Rock if there one in any city we visit as I worked at the one in London once. This is a good one the staff are super friendly especially DJ and Kim at the bar. The drinks were good the music, and the atmosphere. Didn't eat while we were there but Hard Rock food is pretty standard so Im sure it was good
4
hard rock restaurant was good place. trendy ambience and interior decoration. typical western style hotel. you can see multi nationals getting along quiet easily. the nachos were tasty and we get all western cusine here
4
The food undoubtedly was great. The nachos and the chicken club sandwich particularly, are recommended. Music fills the restaurant making it the perfect place to dine with friends. But for us, the merchandise was the high point of the visit
3
Been to a few around the world and would rate this one as the worst for service and the food was only average
5
Burger excellent, and nice live band, don't go here if you don't like noisy restaurant.Service fast, i like to go here at least once every time I go to Singapore
5
I come to Singapore 2 or 3 times a year and always stop in at the HRC. I have known some of the bar staff there for years now, and it's always great to catch up. Jasmin, Chai, DJ, and others are all beyond friendly. It's interesting to watch them mix some pretty bizarre drinks while tossing bottles and tumblers around. They seem to genuinely have a good time while providing great service.I enjoy live music, they have some really good bands that play in there that put on a good show
3
I've been to many HRCs all over the world and the food always sucks, so I refuse to eat at them anymore. I came in to buy one collector pin and I headed right out, the employees are always friendly and helpful
4
We have been going to all the Hard Rock we can find wherever we are in our travels. You can rely on the quality of the food. The jumbo combo is excellent for sharing. The servers in this location just need to remember to refill the sodas or bring us the utensils. They are very accommodating and courteous when reminded of what we are missing or need. The food prices and the merchandise in the gift shop are always expensive wherever you go but always seek their location. They need to have an alternative way to get in the restaurant besides the stairs for those that are too weary from the walk and heat
5
We have had our kids birthdays at Hard Rock Singapore for years. It's very kid friendly and they always get the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday. Mec and Boco were particularly helpful this time - as was Justin. Thanks guys - we will be back
1
Very disappointing. A group of 7 of us visited this restaurant as everybody would be able to eat something here as a few of us were picky eaters.The starters arrived before the drinks, then the mains arrived and the starters had not even been cleared yet. We were not offered more drinks and struggled to catch a waiter as they ignored us.This place is not cheap and for the money you would expect better quality of food and service. Just avoid it and go somewhere local, picky eaters are not worth this expensive mistake
5
we love all hard rock s and we went to all 3 in singapore. the airport and sensota island were ok but this one is the best with the memoblia and good food, not cheap but no hard rocks are. enjoyed experience
5
Had a great night 2 nights at Hardrock. My wife worked in Hardrock, London with the famous "Rita"! and she says it is up there with the best! The staff were very friendly and a great laugh. Great band playing as well. The barmen Kim and DJ were excellent. Kim was incredible with his bottle throwing skills. Prices for drinks very Singaporian but that's Singapore so all in all a great after dinner venue for us! Would recommend it even though we didn't eat there
5
We've visited the branch at RWS and this main branch is much better! The service crew is friendly, and they even brought out a booster seat for our 6.5 month old baby girl so that I could eat better without her in my carrier :) the food is great, the crew kept offering to refill my Cecil tea, and they checked back on us several times to make sure that we were having a good time. Even the ladies was equipped with a changing table and it was easy to change my toddler!! Great place, good atmosphere, wonderful service crew. Keep it up!!
4
Haven't laughed this hard in ages. Kumar was absolutely brilliant, and for a South African, I still got just about all the humour. Hard Rock Singapore, is an institution not to be missed. Great vibe, excellent service and the food portions were huge. All in all, it was a fantastic night that will be remembered for a long time
5
We were staying close to Orchard Road so when we felt like burgers for dinner we decided to go to Hard Rock. Usually Hard Rock Cafe's are in prime locations. This location is a little strange but I guess being close to Orchard Road is all you need.Our waiter was really good. He sat down with us for a chat at one point. I cannot remember his name but he was from Kuala Lumpur.We were upstairs which I don't think has quite the same vibe as downstairs but that suited us on this occasion.As always we both enjoyed a cocktail. I must say the Southern Rock is a new favourite.We would both recommend a visit here
2
We have been to a number of other Hard Rocks and unfortunately I have to say this was the worst. It was late afternoon and early for dinner but the place was deserted. The staff tried too hard because they weren't busy and therefore gave us poor service by being in our faces. The food was not up to the usual Hard Rock standard and there was no atmosphere. The Hard Rock on Sentosa looked much better although we only went to the Rock Shop there
5
We went for lunch during the week and they do a fabulous 3 course lunch for $15 including soft drinks. The service was exceptional and was probably the best meal we had in Singapore. They also didn't add ++ on the bill for GST and service.
4
Just another Hard Rock Cafe. Great location close to Orchard street, and they have live bands on certain days
3
I spotted this place when I was on a hop-on and hop-off sight seeing bus. I got off the decided to give it a try. Albeit the services were good as much Singapore shops, the food was far below average as I ordered a western dish, as I remembered.So the lesson for me was: do the Rock when in North America or UK where they do the food right. When in Singapore, stick to the local fares which would be the local cooking forte.The menu is also higher priced than North American ones, after factoring the currency exchange rates
3
I quite like Hard Rock CafÃ©s and American themed restaurants in general, and whilst the service and environment was typical of the chain, I was disappointed with the food.I ordered a Wagya burger and asked for it well done. It arrived very pink indeed and barely luke warm. The staff were fine, but it was not what I expected
5
We celebrated my husband's 30th Birthday here at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight. Service was Excellent. Staff were very attentive and helpful and service prompt. Food arrived with minimal waiting time. Food was Great! Had the Hickory smoked Cheeseburger and the Mushroom Swiss Burger. Portions were large and the Patty succulent. Love the Chocolate Milkshake. Cecil Ice Tea is So Refreshing and a MUST TRY-Refillable too! ;PMusic from the live band was enjoyable.Thank You Hard Rock for a Lovely and Memorable Evening! Will be back
1
This restaurant actually made me detest the Hard Rock chain, overall. It needs a complete overhaul. I try to visit Hard Rock in every new Hard Rock location I go to. I've been to D.C., NYC, Murtle Beach, Hawaii, Vegas, SF, Dublin, Edinburgh, Sydney, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, a few others, and now Singapore (not including the airport Hard Rock, which is okay). Most of these Hard Rocks have been great and have reinforced why I liked the chain.This Hard Rock - By far, one of the worst Hard Rocks and one of the worst restaurants in Singapore. Very inattentive staff, mediocre food, poor management, attempts to overcharge on items not ordered, etc. etc. Even closing down for special events with so much seating available... I would like to write Hard Rock personally and explain to them that there are restaurants within their chain that do not represent their brand at all. Extremely disappointed. I will honestly be looking for a new way to show my friends and families some of the awesome places I've visited. -Jame
4
Went out to tea for my Dads 60th. As always I enjoy going to Hard Rock no matter what city. A great atmosphere and the staff were great. The meals were good and the kids ate all of theirs which is good when you have picky eaters. Could have done without the 10 year old attempting to sing karaoke but that will never happen again thank god.
4
The meal was very nice and the service was good, the food came out pretty quick but you have to get out of the restaurant for the toilet, anyway still recommended. (Hard Rock Sentosa)
5
We flew 9,000 miles to get to Singapore and the first place we saw was Hard Rock. We immediately went in to get a guitar pin to add to my husband's extensive HR collection. The next day we decided to eat lunch and knew the menu would be outstanding. The meal was great, and for once the music was not too loud. The server was a bit on the slow side but other servers covered her tracks. Great place, just like home
1
Went in for dinner after 9.00pm and waited 25 mins till someone appeared to serve. We ordered a full meal and starter which was cold and we had to send it back. Meal finished at 10.00pm when we were advised that if we wanted to stay we have to pay as the band was about to start. This meal cost over 100.00 pounds for 3 and they were unable to take my MasterCard, their machine could not swipe it. After waiting another 15mins I was asked if I could pop behind the counter and input a pin number. The worst café I have been in and I have visited Hard Rock all over the worl
3
This restaurant serves average food although the portion sizes are adequate the menu items are a little bit expensive for what you are getting. Not the best Hard Rock Cafe restaurant I have been to
5
We rocked up and the General Manager must have taken a liking to us and offered my fiance a free Hard Rock t-shirt!. What an awesome guy. Made the visit that much more special
4
Popped in for an early dinner with kids. Band were doing a sound check but this was well advertised and we stayed anyway, enjoying the show. Brilliant service from all staff but in particular Teresa who treated the kids like rock stars. Lovely meal, wife and I had a starter each then shared a duo plate which avoided the usual HRC overeating issue! Nice walk down Orchard Rd to top it off.
3
I frequent as many of the HRC's worldwide as I can, now over 20. Nice place, great HRC music. The food was off. Buffalo wings were spott on!!! Mac and cheese side was great. Our steaks however were not cooked as they should have been. Medium or any cooking type should be even, not just one piece. Since the main course our reason for eating here and my expectations are higher for a worldwide franchise, input 3 stars
4
Have an excellent lunch with a few colleagues recently. It was crowded for a weekday and was not surprised after the meal - awesome food indeed! Loved the freshness & deliciously tossed rocket salad with grilled chicken; the unusual plated and crispy Onion Rings; and the pan-fried salmon that rocked my taste buds. Also, couldn't stop eating the skinny fries! One of the best hard rock cafes that I have ever dined at in Asia. A truly long standing theme restaurant that still rock my world
2
Compared to other Hard Rock cafes, the food and drinks here was not good. First we ordered drinks, I ordered a Mojito and my husband ordered a Long Island Iced tea, and in both you tasted the alcohol mote than anything else. I ordered the New York steak, witch is one of the most expensive dishes they have, and they first served it with mashed potatoes witch was not in the menu, it said fries, so I sent it back requesting the that. That was evidently not popular with the waitress, she expressed clear discontent. When it finally came back, it was only the steak with garlic butter on, dry fries and boiled vegetables. No salad, sauce or garnish, looked like they had thrown it on the plate. I ordered medium, it was over cooked and barely pink inside. I asked for gravy, it took forever, didn't get it until I was half finished eating the dry meal. So I would recommend to try the two other Hard Rock Cafe's in Singapore instead of this one
4
LIKED: compared to other HRC that i have visited, this one for a sunday brunch was quiet. No live music, inspite of the advt and other media writing about Sundays with live music. LONG ISLAND ICE TEA is good! Choice of beer limited, but we had the Erdinger draft! Tres bien. Good service and quite an interesting server when we visited. Near by to Orchard blvd.
3
A must stop for us in country of visit.Well, as in Hard Rock around the world, it's pretty much the same. We got our Hard Rock T-shirts as usual. Had a beer and wine, enjoy the live band. Rock as usual
4
We have been to many of these restaurants and it is always great, no complains apart from the air con being a little to cold .Food was great and a good band playing the night we were there
4
Staff at entrance not friendly enough to welcome guest.. Waiter keep on coming again and again saying that this and that is not available (dish that we select) but he has the effort to propose new dish as replacement. the live band is not 'live' enough.. the surrounding in the cafe is good. food is delicious. i've been to HR Malacca, far better than this one. overall, ok lah.
2
Well I have been to most Hardrock cafés now and this has to be the worst by far !We arrived with our 8 year old, decked out in one of his numerous HR T shirts , no welcome , just a 30 minute wait . Went upstairs to the bar , which to be honest looks like a nice cream parlor and noticed lots if free tables , told all reserved .... We waited and no one sat at them so obviously understaffed .We ordered a gin and tonic , completely flat and when we told the bartender , if you can call him that he argued with us three times that it wasn't . Strange that he took the ice out and kept the drink under the counter , maybe for the next unsuspecting victim.We ordered the food , well we shouldn't have . The burgers are obviously bring pre cooked as all three were completely cold, think mine was out of the fridge. I sent mine back , and a "fresh " one arrived in two minutes.Same issue . And the fries were cold.I was asked if everything was alright to which I said no , but they just walked off,We didn't eat our food , asked for the bill , paid .... When I left I said to the host that it was the worst Hardrock experience we had ever had .... She said I know , sorry :/)Shame Hardrock can't cook a burger any more They used to have a saying "Hot food , cold beer"I'd like to suggest they change it to cold food , flat drinks And Love all serve all Should be hate all , serve no one Will I go back ? Not a chance By the way we didn't get a discount and didn't want one we just wanted a decent burger . Which we never received eitherMcDonalds would have been a better choice
4
Food was good. Atmosphere was good with life music. Had to keep reminding the waitress to refill or drinks. There were people waiting by our table for us to finish eating so they could have our table. Not so pleasant.
5
We really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant, food, service and drinks were all what we expected plus more. Very friendly and attentive staff, great for a quick bite to eat or extended drink break. Could not fault our meal or service
4
Good foo and service.Live bands playing with the general quality very high.I was here a couple of times in the 10 days I was in Singapore this trip and on all occasions the music was very good.Good night out
5
When traveling we don't usually eat American foods but you can always bet that the Hard Rock will have good food. It was for a late lunch and the band was setting up for the evening so it was busy, loud the way Hard Rock can be. We didn't mind as we enjoyed the great burgers and salad. Service was fast and good like the food. You can't go wrong at Hard Rock and we have been to many around the world because we know we are going to always have a great meal
4
Brought two friends that have not been to the Hard Rock for a long while. We had lots of fun indeed! A really enjoyable night besides the companionship (Samantha & Miranda) - the food (awesome); the drinks (exotic); the band (mesmerizing); and very attentive service! We love the spinach dip; the bbq ribs as well as the colourful air mexico drinks (with corn chips)! Keep it up Hard Rock Café Singapore
4
Tried and trusted brand - usual excellent burgers and another Hard Rock Cafe now ticked off the lis
4
I've visited this Hard Rock Café around 4 times from 2013 to present - All for an evening meal.The atmosphere in evening is great - Loud music, usually a live band & dim lighting, all with plenty hustle & bustle of people at the bar enjoying cocktails etc.The menu is huge & has something for everyone. Great steaks, burgers, pulled pork etc. The portions are large as well. Drinks menu is also huge & the cocktails are great.Service can be patchy with you having to sometimes wave down a server but not always.I will visit again I'm sure
2
We went to Hard Rock Cafe Singapore twice and both times had the same bad experience with the way they treat customers. We came there to see our friends performing as they were part of the live music program that night. When we arrived the place was packed and we actually didn't want to eat but just have drinks (it's called "Cafe" after all!). We were told that only people having dinner will be given a table but since the bar area was completely packed there was simply no space for us, including the people who were supposed to go on stage that night. There's a whole second level with plenty of space to sit, which they refused to open up saying that they have no staff to serve us. After a very long discussion they finally opened up the second level and that was it. We got drinks hence apparently there was staff, so not sure what was the issue. The second time it was the same scenario with an even poorer outcome. Again, no space nowhere but we actually wanted to eat there as well this time. So again, we asked if there wasn't a chance to open the second level (when is that ever open if not on a Saturday night with a full house?) and the rude reply we got was "No, I'm the manager, I decide". We even offered to bring the food upstairs ourselves if the lack of staff was an issue. The final solution was to offer us a spot behind a curtain next to the kitchen that had space for three people (we were seven). So we decided to leave and have dinner elsewhere and then just come back for the band members to perform. By the time we came back the place was half empty already so we managed to sit downstairs. Within the next one and a half hours we were not asked a single time if we would like to order a drink (despite the fact that at the time there was really no more than half of the tables occupied and enough staff available. And being a group of seven it wasn't very hard to see that we were sitting there). So we just sat there, waited for the gig to finish and then left. I'm not sure if that's how you are trying to make money but clearly that's not how it works. I don't mind waiting for food if I know that there's not enough staff or if I get a friendly negative response to my inquiries. But the way they deal with people is being condescend and unfriendly. I have no idea if the food is nice or not but I guess I will never find out. And not sure if that's relevant but when the live music was over they started playing techno music...nothing I would expect in a hard rock cafe either

As many tourist the hard rock is a must do for a burger and a beer.We called in at 6 pm on a Saturday night and it was just starting to get busy.Food was ok I had pulled chicken and my husband had a burger which he said was good but bread feel apartDrinks cool but over pricedWait staff polite Only ok to u

Let me start with admitting that I am a huge fan of hard Rock Cafe chain. Not the food, tough.I have only once had a meal there, and ince a cocktail, but this is not the impressive part of my visits.I love the rock shop and collect t-shirts : Happy to see that in Asia they offer quite a variety as compared to Europe.I also love to look at the rock stars' gadgets displayed there...People from the staff were absolutely sweet and friendly :

Excellent place for a quick and reasonably priced feed. Great atmosphere with music videos playing from many different era. They had a live band one night that was very good
4
good music , good staff and legendary decoruma bit expensive I regret to choose within a small menu.Some added dishes would be greatA waitress forgo tme for dessert and had to ask for her several times when overcrowded on Thursday nigh

The only reason I came here was because my brother wanted to go here and he was buying. I can't understand why these type of "theme" restaurants serve garbage uninspired food and charge an arm and a leg and think by showing Led Zeppelin videos on giant screens somehow justifies the poor value.I ordered a Nasi Goreng and it tasted worse than mall court food at 5X the price. My brother and his wife ordered steak and they were small and tough. My wife caesar salad was pasable considering the local produce. The server tried to do the best he could but his effort didn't make up for the other aspects of this experience. We were there for dinner and there was a roving gang of 5-6 kids running around screaming their heads off. Parents didn't do anything and restaurant management didn't do anything to tell the parents to control their kids. If I wanted to go to Chuck E Cheese's, that's where I would have gone. Sorry Hard Rock, you'll have to do more than hang up some old geezer's guitar and play videos to charge 5X normal for sub-standard food. The restaurant charges like a fine dining establishment but has none of the appeal. Avoid this restaurant - better yet, avoid this chain
4
Always find the food reliable and great servings when you go to a Hard Rock EstablishmentHad reserved a table so we could see the band later in the night, didn't get a great table in first instance but the guy who looked after us got an even better table for us and it was no problem to him.Quick to get us some drinks and always checking our drinks to make sure we were never looking for the next oneFood is consistent with other Hard Rock Establishments around the world and we could only just finish our meals as they are generous servingsAlways a great place to come, the staff are super friendly and service with a smile is synonymous with Hard Rock.Entertainment was great and would always ensure we continue to check out these places when travelling around the world.This place is located at the start of Orchard road and is fairly easy to get to, virtually opposite Orchard Tower

First time to this venue in 1.5 years since being in Singapore. We went along as we had been to Hard Rock Cafe Bali three weeks ago (great place) and Hard Rock Café Hong Kong a week ago (small but great service and a good band) and it seemed like a good idea to do the hat-trick. We were not impressed. Dated décor. It Iooks and feels more like a restaurant that happens to be called the Hard Rock Café. We were seated in one corner at the side of the stage and could not see the band. We asked to move to a table that was freed up as soon as one was available. We had to ask staff when we saw a table free and I don't think they would have bothered otherwise.Service, as usual for Singapore, was slow. We weren't given a server and it took ages to get any ones attention. Staff in Singapore have the ability to look busy and avoid seeing you. We waited at least 10 minutes before we caught some ones attention to place our order. We were thinking of leaving at this point but persevered. We ordered our drinks straight away as we explained that were thirsty. After 25 minutes we had to remind the server our drinks hadn't arrived. The menu indicated my driink was only served as a pint but I was given a 25cl glass. After checking the menu and pointed this out. To give them their due they brought me a pint and only charged for a pint.The food came surprisingly quickly. The food was okay, well cooked but nothing special.The band was okay the Saturday night we were there but it was pop not rock, not even soft rock
4
Went here on a Sunday night for happy hour and stayed for Open Mic night. The truth is, you don’t go to Hard Cafe for the food. You go for the experience. Last night was not an exception. While our shared appetizer sampler was nothing to write home about, we had a blast hanging out with the “locals” (mostly expats from the United States, Australia and New Zealand), and cheering on the live acts.From our server Satish, to Mike the Open Mic Night emcee, to the manager, Gerry, Hard Rock delivered on fun, friendship and good ol’ fashion rock-n-roll
2
A tired looking restaurant. Food, just ok - a little over done. I am a rock music fan, but not what was playing there. Will avoid next time in Singapor
3
Pretty cookie cutter....it's like all other Hard Rock Cafe's world wide. Food is average and the servers lacked an sense of personality or interest in the world they were performing. There are much better choices in the neighborhood unless you are simply a Hard Rock groupi
5
We have been living in Singapore for 6 months now and have been to the HRC Orchard Road about 5 times. We Love it!!! We've found sunday nights are the best time to visit. It's happy hour 4-7pm then it's open mic night from 7pm. They have some excellent musicians playing including Peter Fogarty and the night we went a guy from Kansas called Scott Knost. He was brilliant. The atmosphere is fantastic. The burgers are the the best in Singapore, especially the 10oz one and they do Kronenburg Blanc in the happy hour deal. The staff are brilliant at not letting your whistle dry up and are very friendly (not always the case in Singapore). As soon as I finished my pint they were on hand to ask if I want another one and even did this bang on 6.59pm before the end of happy hour. Now that's what I call service!! And free sweets in the toilet!! Happy Days!! We spent 5 1/2hrs in there with friends from the UK that currently live in Bangkok.A special mention needs to be given to the manager Gerry Cox who is very accomodating and a very good musician himself. HRC is a great place to take children. My 3 year old daughter loves it there and we'll be celebrating her 4th birthday there in 2 weeks time!!I gave it a 4/5 for value simple because it did end up being a bit pricey but to be fair we were there for a long time.Overall a fantastic night out with excellent entertainment, fabulous fajitas, great nachos, succulent burgers and decent cheap drinks (a rarity in Singapore)! Seven very satisfied and full-up customers!

Ok... Hard Rock is never going to be 'gourmet'. But, the venue which is tucked away behind very busy Orchard Road, is the perfect respite for a decent burger, drink and to rest tired feet before continuing shopping/exploring. Only main complaint... Where are all the yummy milkshakes?
5
Saw a great band Blue Jade at HRC.Had draft kronenburg not common in Singapore accompanied by the best nachos every. So big, bring friends if you wanna survive the night. Great atmosphere. With great music every night right on orchard R
5
When we get there, upstairs was closed. They let me go there and I noticed that there were memorabilia from Led Zeppelin and David Gilmour(Pink Floyd), two of my all time favourites. I asked their Manager if it's possible to eat upstairs in those tables and they let us go there!So in upstairs we had our private dinner and friendly waiter kept good care of us. So Thank You, it was absolute pleasure
2
been there one evening. Nachos were ok, the Burger also, but definitively nothing in particular. There was a nice live band playing, again "just normal". Unfortunately the air conditions let us feel like sitting in a fridge. Service was fair, but again also low end
2
After several days of being adventurous, I opted for dinner at the hard rock cafe. Service was quite good and friendly. I ordered the fish sandwich which was billed as panko crusted cod on a brioche bun with tarragon and lemon tartar sauce. What I got was a pre frozen piece of fish on a bun comparable to McDonald's, certainly not brioche. It was so stale that the crust of the bun was peeling off. Oh well. The Carlsberg was cold.
4
while in singapore i had to visit the cafe to add to my collection, and to be fair it was the same as all the others i had visited!! pity the server didn't understand i wanted to have a bottle of BUD, i had to give it its full name
2
Problem #1I made a reservation before hand, worried that seats might be fully booked when I reached there.Thought that everything would go smoothly.It was raining heavily that day, and we were 15 mins late.When I reached, the staff impatiently told me that our seats had been taken because we were late.She exasperated and said that they'd called me many times but I didn't pick up.I apologized as we were caught in the rain.Went to my table and checked my phone - 0 missed call.What? Who did they call?Why did I apologise?Problem #2We were served by a young girl (saw that she's a trainee afterwards)Took out our Entertainer 1 for 1 voucher, which entitles us to 1 for 1 entrees.It was then that the girl told us that we can't use 2 vouchers for a table.Only 1 voucher for 1 table.I was befuddled because my past experience using the voucher was smooth.Nobody said we cant use 2 vouchers for a table.We asked if it's possible for her to split our bills, so that we can use both vouchers, but she said "No, you guys are seated in the same table, same bill."When we asked her to get other colleagues or managers, she said she's not the one who set the rules, everyone would say the same thing to us.In the end, we relented, and settled for 3 mains, using 1 voucher.We were not impressed with the trainee's attitude.I'm not sure who taught her or told her that the entertainer vouchers cant be used together.A check on the Entertainer web showed the below:Number of diners23456 or more Maximum number of Cards / Vouchers11223That means, we're entitled to 2 vouchers usage for 4 pax!I feedback and send an email to hardrock cafe, but received no news thereafter.It doesn't matter now.All I know is my group of friends are never ever going back there again
3
Visited HRC today and left not very happy. We were seated fairly quickly and got menus. We waited for about 15 minutes before anyone would come and take our order......i asked a lady with a headset / radio to take our order, she basically just brushed me off.....finally we got someone to help us.....25 minutes later!!!! The service i have to say is really bad.....it was never like this......i have been here a few times over the years.The food was terrible....i ordered the NZ steak with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies (Sin$30). The steak was mostly fat and grizzle, hardly any meat to speak of.....i complained but it fell on deaf ears. The server just shrugged her shoulders and gave me a bill.I am a HRC Rewards member.....obviously being a member means nothing at this establishment.......Not a very good visit for an HRC, normally the food and service is pretty good.......this time guys, YOU SUCK BIG TIME!!
4
We found ourselves dropping in here after our booking at another place was ruined. Sure I was going to be cranky for the rest of the evening, we went in for 1 drink. It was great. Solved my bad mood and thoroughly enjoyed sitting back for a while. So glad we went in there
4
Wherever we are, we always like to make a trip to the Hard Rock Cafe. The menu is pretty good and the atmosphere with the memorabilia is good too. Managed to time our visit with a downpour in Singapore so worked well. Staff are very attentive, so attentive they were trying to take our dishes away before we had completely finished however I think he was new, so no worries. The kids had the huge burgers, I had the pulled chicken sandwich and my husband had the mac n cheese with chicken. All meals were lovely.A bit pricy ($150 for 4 meals and soft drinks) however to be expected but not somewhere to go every day
3
Hard Rock Cafe is always a safe middle of the road restaurant. Server was attentive to detail in meeting our dietary requirements. Food was fresh and it was an overall pleasant experience, would return.
4
I regularly travel through Changi Airport en route to exotic destinations and I am always happy to eat at Hard Rock Cafe in Terminal 3. The restaurant was recently remodeled and continues to sport unique Rock N Roll memorabilia. Most of the food offerings at Changi are fast food or chain restaurants with few offerings. Their salads are always fresh, generous and creative and the service is always excellent. Certainly has been a food oasis for my for many years between long flights
4
Hard Rock cafe the food good staff friendly & polite waiting no long as we found in some cafe , in general enjoy the stay and eat health
4
I've visited HRC on and off for many years, but have recently started going back more regularly to catch their Open Mic Nights on Sunday, hosted by the ever-talented Mike Spinks. The place is always packed to the gills at dinner time, which means making a reservation is crucial. Can't say enough about the food. Everything I've tried has been top-notch in terms of taste, portion sizing and quality - I'd recommend the New York strip steak, which is a tad on the pricey side but worth it compared to what you might get elsewhere for the same price. Alternatively, you can't go wrong with any of the burgers. When things get busy, though, be warned that service can get slow - even for drinks - but I think this is something they are working on, if my last visit was anything to go by.Open Mic nights usually put on some excellent acts which play various genres, after which the house band comes on. Overall, HRC makes for a good, leisurely, music-filled night out
4
Whichever city I visit if its got a Hard Rock Cafe it's a must for me to visit usual stuff same decor rock and roll food same local booze but a great atmosphere love all serve al
4
Went for lunch on a Sunday, service was really good (no shortage of staff here like other Hard Rocks) and the meal sizes were surprisingly good compared to other Singapore restaurants and tasted good too. Drinks were well priced and were delivered quick. We have a habit of going to hard rock cafes every where we travel and while this is not the best it is rated very high and would have to be the best place we ate in Singapore. It could do with a bit of a facelift up and an outdoor area would be nice, it is also not on a main road and a little tricky to find but glad we went there
5
i eat out a lot but HRC Singapore just stands out in service and good food. the Apple Crumble is a must try
2
Visiting Hard Rock in the Cities we visit has become a "Must Do" for my teenage daughters, but they were disappointed with Singapore. The food was mediocre, the service average and the atmosphere was non existent. It is the first Hard Rock that we have left feeling it wasn't worth the visit
3
The restaurant itself is good and the food is what you come to expect from Hard Rock. The artefacts are good - jacket from James Brown, guitars from Eric Clapton music heaven.The service on this day was not great. The staff were everywhere but not helpful. One of our mains arrived ten minutes before the other and first had gone cold. Hopefully we caught them on a bad day
3
You know what you are going to get when you enter a Hard Rock Cafe and apart from a few local items on the menu the Singapore HRC is exactly the same as the rest of the franchise chain. Great dinner style food, the addition of chicken satay is also recommended. The staff were all very helpful and welcoming, Music was spot on for a HRC and the drinks cold. if you like live Rock music its worth a visit Thursday and friday nights if you like rock is worth a trip
5
I'd like to compliment one of your employee named Mark for the excellent service provided to us last Monday. He was so helpful and he welcomed us with a beautiful smile and lead us going to the table we request for him. Set lunch promotion was awesome and delicious. He always check and ask if everythings okay, hows the food, and whenever his busy he still have time to double check our table. I have always been pleased with the service I receive at your branch. However, his professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation quickly exceeded my expectations.Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended
5
Great night out, food was good an so were the bands, just talented locals and some over seas travelors having a go, top service and friendly staff, couldn't do enough for you, made sure we had a good table so we could see the stage. Staff kept checking on us to see if every thing was ok
3
Hi, i'm a Hardrock fans for a very long time. Never fail to visits hardrock if i travel to other countries too. Went to Hardrock last wednesday with a group of friends and was very dissappointed. The fat lady on stage was shouting instead of singing. I pity her, she was trying to sing almost all high pitch songs and she do it badly. Honestly it hurts our ears and it sound terrible. Thank god all our request to the dj is fullfilled. Cool guy, very entertaining and awesome music selections. Overall, staff and food always rock!!Thank yo
2
Loyal Hard Rock customer because of the way the staff look after you and nothing was different here. However what is normally a safe haven for good food was not the case. Had Mixed Satay, the pork must have come from the little piggy that had none as it looked more like ant and the chopped onions where at best chopped only twice. Full mouthful of raw Onion is not a pleasant addiiton. Unfortunately did not get better with the main, actually ended up sending it back. Chicken Fajita where the chicken was obviously processed in look and texture and the griddle of vegetables were not cooked and actually still fridge cold. That said service to solve the issue was brilliant and unquestioning. The overal atmosphere still good concidering I was dining very early
5
We went to the Hard Rock Cafe and was so please with the happy hour prices for drinks. Half price beer, wine, and rails. We also had the brochettes and it was vey good. Will be going back again
5
Really fab staff and huge American servings (biggest salad I've EVER seen!!). There was some confusion over the bill towards the end of the night but the Manager sorted it out on the spot with a smile. I also met the General Manager (he was moving around tables to say hi to customers) and he was a super guy - friendly, chatty and very customer service oriented. Highly recommend the HRC Orchard. Oh...and the band rocked out! Glad there's a venue in Singapore that doesn't play the same old "nightclub" DJ stuff that you find everywhere else
4
Good food and service as always in the hard rock chain would recommend will definitely be making a return visi
5
Visited the cafe for lunch today, 5th October.Things started off pretty umpleasant as we were desperately trying to get the staff attention until a lady ( could be the supervisor or manager as she wasnt in uniform) who finally noticed us frm the end of the cafe. Orders were finally taken and we were surprised by her great sense of humour.The whole experience was satisfying as eveything started to change after that. Kudos to the team! We will be back anytime soon. However the place look kinda old, maybe the management need to do something about it
1
The service is awful and the drink prices are outrageous !.We went to the HRC on a Monday evening around 10pm. It was a shambles.After 20 minutes watching one of the staff stood at the till trying to figure out how to change Fries for Mash on kids menu, we ceded defeat and left.This debacle was after enduring an initial wait of 15 minutes at the bar amongst a hoard of other potential diners for a table which we never got (despite the upper tier being closed and most seated guests trying frantically to either pay up & leave or maybe get served so they could eventually pay up and leave).On the positive side...Despite spending nearly 1 hour in HRC Singapore, I never did get asked if I wanted to order a drink so the SGD 18 pint of Carlsberg is still something I only saw on a menu and didn't actually get around to imbibing thank goodness
4
Went mid afternoon and it was very quiet. We had the regular Burger and a Singapore Satay burger. The Satay burger was excellent as was the regular burger. No complaints, would go again but I still think the hard rock cafe's are overpriced
4
We went here as a family with two young adults and parents. We had to wait about 30 minutes before we got the food, but the service was excellent and the food was good. We had such an amazing time and so much fun, there were live bands and everyone sang along and we stayed there for almost 4 hours eating food and having drinks. One of my best family memories ever
5
In fact, whether you are into rock music or not, a visit is a must. My daughter is on a mission to visit as many as possible around the world. 10 down, many more to go. Little surprised that the location was tucked off the main road and was expecting a greater impact from outside - it is Singapore!! Very different inside and it did not disappoint. Service efficient with a smile. Quality up to expectation - probably Bahrain still top, but Singapore a close second and London still bottom for quality & service [sorry London]. Also visited shop where they were very friendly & helpful.A must visit - restaurant & museum of music paraphernalia
5
the deco is superb, the food that serve same as usual - good, the environment is superb, the service staff is friendl
3
Went as close to hotel and kids were after more western-type food. As in most cases in Singaore when western food is involved, its usually expensive and not always well done as was the case here. Nothing to recommend particularly. And even after relieving us of our money could not even get a smile from our waitress, she must have missed that part of the hospitality training
4
Food that was more 'normal' not just Asian influenced which we had been eating for the past two weeks on our holiday. Friendly staff, nourishing meals
3
Nothing special. Standard HRC food and drinks menu, music that falls more into the "80s AOR" bracket than "Hard Rock", quite a flat atmosphere.Food was well-cooked and prepared, staff could be a little more diligent, so all in all, average is probably a fair description
4
We have just completed an Asian triple have visited Hard Rock in Bangkok, Phuket and Singapore during our Asian vacation.As is to be expected the quality of food has been good all the way and Singapore was good. I had the Nasi Goreng from the wok menu and it was excellent. The interior design is good with the usual amounts of memorabilia and the service was attentive.Only negative, as has been the case around Asia,mins that the music is too quiet. It doesn't need to be cranked up so you can't here yourself speak but it does need to be loud enough to here it.If HR Singapore can fix that the it would get 5 stars, particularly from the teenagers in our famil
5
After spending all day at universal, we went in to The Hard Rock café to cool down & refuel, also get some souvenirs !!! Excellent, good food & drinks as usual.
3
You can't say anything bad about their burgers! You're more than full after one of those!That being said this Hard Rock Café is missing some of that party-feel you get at the one in London. It's quieter and the service isn't as flamboyant.And for a massive chain like Hard Rock Café I can't find any reason why they haven't got a better location than this in downtown Singapore
4
I like visiting Hard Rock Cafe in every city I visit and grabbing a souvenir along the way.This one was really tiny and almost empty when we got there. The show was on and the band was great I have to say. 4 very talented singers and musicians. Just had a virgin drink which was cool. Would I go again? Maybe if it was a bit more lively with bigger crowds
5
The usual excellent standard for a Hard Rock. Great food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service from our waitress, Teresa.We were there for my birthday and I was made to feel very special.For HRC fans like myself, there are also cafes at Sentosa and Changi Airport, and a hotel at Sentosa too
3
I was really in the mood for a pulled pork sandwich, plus being stuck in Singapore during the US Independence Holiday. So we went to the Hard Rock. I knew it would be a little pricey but was shocked by the prices.Adult beverages average about S$15+/drink. So 2 drinks each, between my wife and I was S$60 alone !When we arrived, our waitress was all over us. I was hoping to have some more time to think about what i wanted, but she was hovering by my shoulder, eagerly waiting for our drink order.After choosing drinks, we finally decided on food choices. Drinks were promptly served and dinner arrived a reasonable time afterwards. What was annoying was when we wanted to order a second drink. Our waitress had vanished. I was thinking maybe it was the end of her shift. Another waitress came by and fetched us the drink menu. But then she was nowhere to be found. Eventually she did re-appear and we gave her our second drink order. She acknowledged them and left.We waited for our drinks. And waited....and waited. Our food was getting cold. Eventually the first waitress finally re-appeared (I guess she didn't go home after all) and I was able to get her attention. I told her that we had placed drink orders maybe 10+ minutes earlier and they had not yet arrived. Finally, 5 minutes later, they arrived. I guess the delay was due to their having to brew my Carlsberg Extra Cold in the back room (?).By the way, the place was still not that busy, so it's not due to crowds.All in all, it was an OK but very pricey & poor service experience. I doubt we will repeat
4
For kids this is a good choice. Simple food that they enjoy yet a little special. We had a birthday lunch here and they made it special. If this is waht you are looking for, safe and western, then this is worth a visit
4
It's been quite awhile since my last visit at this iconic diner...And generally things haven't really changed - the friendly greetings as you walk up the famous flight of steps all the way to the table, the exciting vibe, cleanliness, great airconditioning, everything!Service crew were full of positive energy and promptly attended to us. There were smiles everywhere + fantastic music + wonderful American fare...Thank you, Eric Clapton for that first move of yours - genius
4
It's just off Orchard right at the top end, go part the hIlton and turn left after 100 yards. Not going to be found unless by accident - but pure HR inside. If you need a Western Food break and some music
4
A comfortable spot in the hussle and bussle of Singapore.Get the Tiger beer... good stuff.I highly recommend this for a live band venue.Doesn't need to be you only stop in Singapore since there is a lot out there but should be at least a stop for you
3
If you want to talk then don’t go to the HRC. Secondly, if you’re visiting Singapore why not try something a little more local. I like HRC’s but generally when I’m either in the US or the UK. Having said this, the food is very good and the service excellent
3
Have been to HRC in Singapore a few times now.The food is good, I had their Chili Crab dip for starters which was amazing and then The Big Cheeseburger with Monterey Jack Cheese. Asked for it to be cooked medium and it was.My main issues with the place are that firstly you feel very rushed from the moment you sit down. Within a couple of minutes you feel like you have to order your whole meal so I didn't out of principle as I want to enjoy my time in a restaurant. Secondly, it just seems to lack atmosphere which is unusual for a Hard Rock Cafe. Anyway, value for money, not bad at all and we will continue to go back. Just don't want to be rushed when I am there with my family
4
Best American-style burger in Singapore, in my opinion. Beer selection here could use help. Otherwise, very much like other HRC's in the chain: A little overpriced, but not bad. Gift shop is a great source of T-shirt souvenirs that actually say "Singapore" on them, nice if you are in a hurry and need easy shopping. Location is very convenient to major Orchard Rd hotels
4
Great place to have a cold drink and check out the emails on the free wi-fi. Very friendly staff make it a pleasurable sto
3
The food and drinks were okay but outrageously expensive. This was on Sentosa Island and the cafe lacked the ambience of other hard rock Cafes - in all, boring
5
I went to the Hard Rock Cafe in Sentosa Island and I was impressed by the Halloween celebration. The staff warmly welcomed us and I savoured every moment in the cafe. The food and cocktail that I had were great. Good quality control
2
My husband and I recently moved to Singapore and were craving some "American" food...we decided to go to The Hard Rock Cafe.We shared the nachos with chicken and then he had the mushroom swiss burger and I had the class burger.The nachos had melted velveeta and canned pickled jalapeÃ±o peppers, not goodMy burger was 20 dollars and was equal or even dare I say lesser than a McDonalds Angus Cheeseburger but the cheese was worse and the meat was, well, I am not even sure what "meat" I was eatingMy husbands burger was just as bad, a couple of mushrooms under the oily piece of cheese.We went during happy hour. There were two drink specials, house wine and one beer, and no appetizer specials
5
the band is the best and the food is great! Service are fast and direct (as usual). We had a meal there after a hard day at work and it has been an ideal choice being there
4
From the outside it looks more like an office building apart from the logo and car decoration. Inside it's typical hard rock. Great food and service. Not sure how long they will stay there because they now have a hard rock hotel on sentosa.
3
Like most Hard Rocks I have been too around the world, the focus is on the music and great rock-and-roll items on the walls. It is usually loud therefore don't expect a lot of conversation. The food is okay. I typically end up here when co-workers from the US are in town and for some reason don't want to try the great local food! Crazy. Service was slower than I would have liked. Had the pulled-pork and no, it is not like Southern food! Overall, it's a comfortable place and some good music if you're from our generation
4
Some times you just have a taste for Western food. Hard Rock is the answer! Food was great, service a little slow. Tunes were fabulous, and the gift shop had a sale
4
This restaurant was convenient as we were staying at traders. The atmosphere and service were both very good. We were a party of 5 and none of us finished our food. It was ok, nothing special. The veggie burger fell apart and tasted awful, disappointing, but hey!Milkshakes were good but pricey. This place is all about the atmosphere and quick service
5
I collect Hard Rock pins, so on my way back from the Orchid Gardens I asked to be dropped off at the Hard Rock. I wasn't planning on eating, but they had a deal I couldn't pass up. A 3 course set menu for $15, inc beverage. I had the sea bass, salad, and brownie and they were very good. There were at least 2 choices to this menu deal. Please check that this special is still available before going so you won't be disappointed. Since I saved so much on lunch I had a well earned Hurricane that cost more than the meal - but oh, so tasty!!
4
Just back from Singapore where we visited our daughter the 3 of us went for dinner we started with a combo to share followed by 6oz burger could not finish it all the portion were so large. Excellent evening ou

I have had worse experiences but not many. Ordered cocktails which took an age to arrive. No sooner had they arrived than the starters arrived. Starters were OK but the main course, with the wrong potatoes, arrived as we were half way through them. Finished starters and main course served, unfortunately they were cold. Manager? arrived to advise would cook fresh mains and not charge for cocktails. Mains reserved but were the original just warmed up a little, gave up at that point and just eat them, had they been really hot would have been OK. Mains cleared and were then ignored until we asked for a dessert menu. Queried cheesecake as New York is traditionally baked. Waitress unsure so went to check with kitchen who she said told her it was baked. Ordered and then the manager? came over to advise it was not baked and was served in a shot glass. A clear training need to ensure all staff know what they are selling. Finally asked for bill and given an additional 10% off but they have missed the point, when you go to eat out you want it right first time, not a free drink or discount.PS was meant to be a celebration for our wedding anniversary, well I don't think we will forget it

Went on a Kumar Night, although I didn't quite get the jokes as they were catered more to the locals but I had a great night laughing away. Great ambience although it was a lil too dimmed. Band was great too, certain songs that they performed could possibly be better than the original singer, with all the respect. I'm definitely going back for more Kumar and great music
5
a long wait to get in about 45 mins but excellent food and location and good value for money something for everyon

We met up with friends at the Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) on Orchard Road in Singapore recently and had an expectedly good meal there. Decor, music and atmosphere s is exactly as can be expected at a HRC restaurant. On the evening we tried the Legendary 10oz. Burger (SG25) which was prepared medium, tasted fine, like a good burger should (rating 3 of 5), enjoyed the fries as well. We also tried the Hickory Smoked BBQ Pork ribs (SG32) that were pretty good. Meat slid right off the bone for the most part, was succulent and decently flavoured. Not the best ribs in the world but pretty good, easy to finish if you like your meats (rating 3.5 of 5). Margarita (SG15) was light on the tequila but what can you expect at restaurant bars these days. Fruit smoothie (SG8) was pretty good and the Cecil Iced Tea was quite enjoyable, definitely suggest this drink if you are eating meat dishes, it compliments both the burger and the ribs well. Overall, a pricey but expectedly good meal at Hard Rock Cafe in Singapore. Would have no problem eating here again
3
Food not great ..prices are ok ....for the exprerince YES ..the decor appeals to the young ..and most performance night are packed ...don't mind going there ..every once a while
4
We struggled a little to find some food we liked in Singapore outside of our hotel so headed to the Hard Rock Cafe. I had burritos which were very good and my husband had a burger which we liked. The staff were pleasant and the restaurant had a happy atmosphere. The music might be a bit loud for some but then it is a Hard Rock cafe
3
Had the New York Steak which was cooked correctly as requested( medium rare), and served with mashed potatoes and buttered french beans. the steaks come with a choice of three standard sauces ie peppercorn, mushroom and red wine. For the price approx SG$50+, I would have expected a salad/corn on the cob to be served at the very least.There are other better appointed restaurants in Singapore that include this for a few dollars more.Service is well meaning but a little chaotic
4
Our friends had recommended this place and hence we booked the place to meet up with Friends.Loved the place. We were very happy with its location, but felt that the interiors could be little better The restaurants pub and the option there was amazing.
4
For us the food is nice quality. Convenient location off Orchard Road. However, the music is sometimes a bit loud for the lunch crowd and a little too cool for me. I know Singapore is hot, but when you been in the heat and go into a restaurant too cool is isn't comfortable, Just my opinion!
5
we always try to go to a Hard Rock Cafe when travelling and this was superb. Ribs were amazing, so tender and meaty, smothered in lovely tasty BBQ sauce. Came with fries, beans & coleslaw...all yummy. Drinks pricey but hey its Singapore! Quick & efficient service
3
Slightly noisy. Cheesecake served in a short glass container, super expensive and nothing extremely tasty that's worth the money to me. Not a very good first time experience for me
4
I’m a massive Hard Rock fan and make an effort to visit whenever I’m visiting a new city. They’re all basically the same, which makes them difficult (or easy?!) to review. This particular outlet is in a great location just off Orchard Road. I’ve visited a few times and it always seems like it has a great, buzzing vibe. Be prepared to wait for a table, especially on weekends
1
Went to have a drinks and cheesecake because of blog post where they recommended this. Cheesecake on a glass cost 19 SGD, seriously: 19 dollars for cheesecake in a glass! It can be that we're not that into this Hard Rock Cafe -thing and rock atmosphere aint our first choice, but still. Also waitress tried to sell refill for my Coke about 3 times. Dont know about the foods, but if you're just going in for drinks (and cake) u have much better options somewhere else, and with this cost u can prolly eat and drink same selections twice somewhere else
4
Too bad that the Asia Card is no longer accepted. Neither the new rewards card is up. Bit confusing Been a regular customer for more than 12 years, this is a bit of a draw back as I entertain a lot. The discounts were quite good and helped to come more often. Also the reservations for dinner end too early (7pm) which makes us rush to get there. Hope some things go back to what they used to be! The rest us still the same.
5
I love to visit a Hard Rock Cafe everywhere I go and pick up a glass for a souvenir. You know what to expect and never disappointed. I got the 3 cheese burger and my friend got the steak. Both were very nice. The music playing on the screen and the memorabilia really makes Hard Rock Cafe something special.
2
This one definitely does not compare to the ones in the U.S.. Service is slow, messy, sloppy. I remember we ordered 3 burgers that took almost an hour to come. The waiters seemed to be completely lost. When the burgers finally came, they were extremely oily. Never went back. There are better places to get a burger in Singapore. Try Dan Ryan's
3
Look - it was OK. Its a hard rock cafe, its a world wide brand, but for me it was way to expensive for the food offered. The 80's music videos playing was the best thing with me trying to guess the band and song without looking at the screen. i wouldn't go agai
5
Good food; much better experience than 1.5 yrs prior.... actually think of returning to them now. Staff was friendly, but would be better if same people tracked you from ordering to delivery to followup and billing.
4
Good range of Hard Rock staples and some Asian twists. Good atmosphere and service and located in a quiet but pleasant part of Singapore
4
close to my hotel, food was good, pricey as with everything in Singapore, only dislike was the level of music being played at 8 pm, a bit to loud for restaurant style, ok for later when the live band plays.
5
We have ordered a plate of chicken chopped salad and fried chicken for dinner in Hard Rock Cafe Sentosa. The portion was huge but delicious. Staff were very attentive and provide water and sauces without asking.
5
Two to choose from, Orchard Road & Sentosa. Great food as you would expect from the HR brand, I usually grab a Wagyu burger & a Tiger at Sentosa Resort as it is next door to the Genting Casino!
3
If you've been to one... Well, they are all mostly the same... There are 2 here in Singapore. One is downtown just off Orchard Rd. and the other is out at the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa Is. They are familar, offer trinkets and collectables if you're looking for that. But..... It's expensive. As is everything in Singapore... Alcohol will put a huge dent in the wallet... but so will the food.. But you can be assured... it's a Hard Rock and if that's what you're looking for, you won't be disapointed.
5
The Hard Rock Cafe at 50 Cuscaden road has great food, great service and quite possibly the best staff at any Hard Rock, and I have been to a few worldwide. The Floor Managers Alisha and Siti are very professional, but more importantly they are some of the nicest people I have ever met.The food as usual is always great, but the staff make it one of the best places to have a good evening out for dinner and drinks!Thank you all for a great time and you made one of my last evenings in Singapore memorable.My tour may be over but I hope to get back here again and I will be sure to come back
5
Had a great 10th birthday party for my son early November. The staff were fab and the manager Siva really made the day extra special by giving him a Hard Rock T-Shirt! the Restaurant all sang happy birthday and all 9 boys had a great time!! Thanks guys!Oh and the food was excellent and great value!
4
Went for a celebration lunch with my husband and 5-year old son at HRC Orchard.The place was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful. We were ushered upstairs to the couch seat which was good to contain my 5-year old... The food did not take long to arrive.. and the portion of the food suffice for our appetite and the taste was not disappointing :) We notice the place got pack towards halfway through our meal... about 12.45pm... it was good that we arrived early... however, that did not stop the staff from being attentive and refilling our drinks and made sure everything was ok for us... Thumbs up, HRC!
4
We had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe on Halloween and it was really special. We are regulars at the Jakarta HRC so had high expectations for the Singapore location and were not disappointed. The food (brisket sandwich and salad) were tasty and the drinks were potent. But what really made the night were the Halloween decor and outfits of the staff, and many of the guests.
4
Only had drinks at the bar, however the staff were very attentive. Drinks are typical Singapore price, very expensive! Layout of restaurant is great, with the band set up so that everyone can see them.
4
Well known Hard Rock style. Enjoyed mye stay and food very much! Very helpfull and service minded crew. A "must see" in Singapore.
4
had lunch here and felt for the price should have been 5* dining. really its just a burger, I know all the knicks and knacks are around but its just a burger
5
Great service and an awesome burger was just what I needed after two weeks away from home. A traditional Hard Rock experience in a fabulous part of town!
4
The usual US food, with good service. Restaurant was tastefully designed, and I loved the stained glass window effect behind the stage.
Get there early to avoid a 30+minute wait for a table, despite it's age its still one of the places to be!
1
We love Hard Rock and always make it a point to visit one wherever we go BUT the one in Singapore ruined our night out. We started off with the appetizer sampler and it came without chicken tenders and after finally locating our server to ask, she nonchalantly replied with, "oh we're out of that." Wld've been nice to be informed when we placed the order! Then,my hubby's med well burger came out with a red cold center,obviously raw and this time a diff server came to attend to us and started by telling us condescendingly that's how med well is. In what world is med well cold and raw in the centre?! AND he had the odesity of asking us what we wanted him to do about it!!freaking cook it so it's edible of course!he grudgingly took the burger n said he'll ask the cook to make it well done. Fine,we were starving n just wanted to eat. 30 minutes later the burger arrived completely burnt so for the 1st time in our lives we asked for the manager who ALSO told us that's how well done is!! We refused to finish our meal n asked for the bill n she gave us 25% off the appetizer n drinks. We've order the same items at Guam, Las Vegas, Tokyo, Nagoya and Hong Kong Hard Rock n they seem to understand how to cook a burger. Hard Rock in Singapore has the worst cusomer service ever! Instead of rectifying an issue,they'd rather have an already angry customer get ticked off to the point of leaving without finishing a meal. What a shame to the Hard Rock franchise!Better off getting a burger at the McDonalds nxt door!! Ridiculous
4
I love Hards Rock, been all over the world. Like any good franchise you know what you're getting and they do it well. The band were great, the service friendly and the food was tasty American fare - all as you'd expect. My only query is why have they listed themselves in the 1 star category price-wise, when a burger and 2 beers cost over $50 
5
Liked : Location smacked at ochard road and walking distance from Hilton hotel. Food was really good. i guess most hard rock has good food. Live band was pretty good as wellDislike: If you're lucky you get to watch a comedy show on stage. Just that the jokes wasn't funny to us who aren't singaporeans.

Start with the carpark to the hotel was very convenience. It is located just underneath the hotel so it's like a private entrance.During the check in it was on the dot, everything was sorted. I dont need to wait, the room is already available. I also like the decor at the hotel lobby. They have artist portairt painted on the canvas which I thought that was simple and cool.The room was spacious, it comes with either a king size bed or a 2 super single bed. It doesnt matter for me as you can combine the 2 super single bed and that is super super huge.It also has a walkin wardrobe concept where you can open the wardrobe both ways whether you're at the vanity area or you're at the walk in entrance.They have a seperation for the shower area and the toilet. Everything was nicely done with privacy.If there is bathtub included i would have rate it excellent so due to that i give it at very good.The room also comes with a balcony with is located at the corner of every floor and those facing the swimming pool. I suggest if you want a breeze from the room or if you're a smoker, do request for the balcony room.And to complete the stay will be the awesome swimming pool. Love how the pool is segmented making it look like you're at an island. I personally like the sand pool, the water is lukewarm again giving you the feel you are at the beach.I noticed that the layout of the hotel with it restrictions to the exit and entrance give you the priviledge of a hotel guest, making sure no trespassers.Will definitely come back again
4
Went here for lunch, got the special- choice of two starters, choice of three mains, ice cream and unlimited soft drink! Definitely very good value for the hard rock and for Singapore! Nothing wrong with the food but nothing special! Went around 2pm place was quite enough but the staff were VERY slow! Took about ten mins to get full and a fiercer ten mins for them to process the payment- I ended up going up to the till myself where I found my credit card unattended! Not impressed by that
3
Staff is always happy! Had a birthday party of a colleague there. The place is quite small and dark at night but the food is fine so we have gone back a few times.
5
Fun place, love the old music videos they show. The food is also really good. The banana smoothies are great.
5
It was a very hot day . So enjoyed our cocktail's had a beautiful lunch more cold drinks. Very friendly helpful staff who took some photo's of us all. Would highly recommend
5
Like all Hard Rock cafes Singapore is awesome visited for the 2nd year in a row whilst on holidays service was fantastic and the staff are great. Will go back next time we are in Singapore.
4
The food is nice and the servings arr quite big. The service crew are efficient and friendly. Going back there!
3
Pricey food which tasted just like any other fast food joint. Service was not really good, we were ignored for quite sometime and had to signal for a waitress to help us. Drinks were so so nothing special. Band was pretty good. Hmm not my kind of place
2
I suppose this is an OK place to take the kids for a burger, but honestly the food is only so so and it is a lousy place to go if your children have any food allergies as everything is preprepared and pre-mucked-about so for example, all the french fries have gluten, etc. We were really, really unimpressed, although it must be said the staff are all super friendly, so well done there
5
My girlfriend and I were on vacation in Singapore for a week. We liked the Hard Rock Cafe so much that we went twice. The lunch specials were very reasonable—about $15 for one person. The food and service were excellent. I bought a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt for my girlfriend. It’s a colorful and good quality one with Jimi Hendrix on the front. It’s always a reminder of a nice visit to the Hard Rock Cafe
4
I always visit Hard Rock cafe at least once when out in Singapore. You get the swift and friendly service. Usually get a hamburger and a couple of beers and enjoy watching people from all over the world and all ages a bit. Live bands at some occasions are always impressing
4
Standard Hard Rock fare that is reasonably priced and tasty - no surprises. Service with a smile and quickly. When we visited the resident band had a good range of music but more Soft Rock rather than Hard Rock but good to listen to all the same
1
Don't waste your time. Small, dirty, expensive. Lack-luster!
1
When there are so many options to choose from in Singapore, why choose an American Chain Resturant?
standard steak ribs and chicken in overly barbeque'd sauce
nothing new.
Good for childrens fun and menu - family friendly.
meh.
4
Great atmosphere, enthusiastic staff and diverse menu.
3
If you've been to one, you've been to them all...standard fare, expensive, and service is lacking...
3
Well, all food sees high in Singapore, but this Hard Rock seemed old and run down.Food was average at best. Served just warm not hot. Staff was friendly, but seemed more interested in announcing birthdays than actually serving the customers.
3
these guys churn out copious amounts of food, but the emphasis seems to be on BIG portions and less on delivering flavor and quality ingredients.
4
Judging by some of the comments by others, standards at this HRC have needed to improve - well, based on my recent vist they have listened because my friend and I were served with well cooked, hot, tasty food.As HRCs go, well, yes, it's a bit smaller than some though not exactly tiny. Food wise we were served the same standard fare as you would, expect in any HRC. After the usual nachos etc I had the pulled pork sandwich - it was truly excellent, succulent, well cooked, and tasty.Service was pretty good on the whole apart from slow delivery of a drinks refill. Restaurant seemed well looked after and was full of apparently happy patrons.We left just as the band were tuning up so can't comment on how good they were
3
I like the food, I like the atmosphere, but where is the service? Before you do something about that i can't recommend this place to others as you get better treatment and joust as good food at a lot of other places in Singapore.Meaning search other restaurants as you still can buy the T-Shirt without having to eat there ;-
4
If you have to spend time at Changi Airport and need to find somewhere to eat a decent meal, this outpost of the Hard Rock Cafe is a good option. We stumbled upon it in Terminal 3 of the airport. It is in a quiet location around the back of the terminal, looking out toward the tarmac. It wasn't overly busy when we were there at dinner time but there were a number of people relaxing and enjoying a drink whilst waiting for their connecting flight. The menu is the same Hard Rock Cafe menu and pricing as anywhere in the world, so you know exactly what you are getting. The burger was good quality and the serving was large. The service wasn't exactly rippingly fast, so don't go if you are rushed for time but if you want a relaxing place to sit and eat in between flights and you have time to kill, this is a good option. It is really easy to get the monorail between T2 and T3 and only takes a couple of minutes, so it doesn't really matter what terminal you flight into or out of. Ask at one of the Help Desks in the terminal if you can't find it
4
If you have ever been to a HRC you'll know what to expect. Having visited many the experience was exactly as expected. One nice touch was that they allowed us to order a cocktail off menu. Singapore HRC is a little pricier than in other countries but as a glass collector I just need to cop that to fuel my obsession LO
3
Same old hard rock! visited it, it's a cafe, a restaturant, a bar, a pub, westernised, rock band, shop, food! Cool place
3
I like to eat in a quiet serene environment - it's important for my total enjoyment of the food. But quiet is not what you will get at Hard Rock Cafe. Also the huge portions are to me, a put off.
3
but the usual high prices of Hard Rock and not very big.... there was an upstairs but I didn't see it
3
This was the place to go in the 80s. Now it's just old and out. Solely for tourists on orchard rd.
4
Delicious set-lunch and great service. Set-lunch menu changes every month! Like the salad!
3
Visited the HR a few times, sorry to say the quality of the food has gone down, the nostalger is still there but food quality matters as well.
3
The rating is average because it is what it is. A Hard Rock Cafe, looks like every other and if it is Hard Rock ribs, burgers etc you are after you wont be disappointed. Sadly coming here takes away an opportunity to try so many of the other options available in a city that prides itself (rightly) on a wide and high quality range of eating options
4
I have been a regular at this restaurant for past 8 years. I love the food served there and also enjoy the live music by various bands on different nights.I like to specially commend the AGM of this restaurant for always being accommodating to my requests whenever I choose to host my friends there for get together.I appreciate the friendliness of most of the staff and like that some even remember my name. They just make me feel at home whenever I visit the restaurant
3
I went there at lunchtime, and I was quite disappointed. The last HRC I had visited was the one in London, a very sought-after one, so that's why I was all the more disappointed by this one. Not only was there absolutely no ambiance at lunchtime, but the service was really not friendly and the hamburger I ordered was cold, the cheese not cooked enough..
5
Served on a tray in a nice shot glass, the first impression of the milky liquid makes you raise your eyebrow like The Rock! But once you get a taste of it, trust me, you'll crave for more!Ask for...Love Juice! I'm not kidding, it's really called Love Juice! ZHEN DE!!Thanks Vic, for a wonderful night!
5
been smoking the competition ! serving one of the best steak !
4
Had a great lunch at the Rock today - Prawn Fajitas, Tenderloin Steak, Country Style Steak - and mudpie! Glorious!!!!
Great food great place. Cool serving staff!
Come hungry!!!!
Leave Happy!
4
Ten out of ten for the food and potions but can the live music be turned down please enough to hear you and your partner talk!
5
Been to hard rock cafe in the singapore airport last night. Awesome food with beautiful people.
5
mind blowing interior, and you actually feel like a rockstar. The buffet included amazing india food.
5
My friend and I had one main course each and a few drinks and it cost over $100. Its a good fun Place and for a bit of a splurge worthwhile.
5
This is a great restaurant for friends and family! Surprisingly, it's a very child-friendly restaurant. My girls love the place and keep asking us to bring them there! The service is wonderful and the food (& drinks) are great! I highly recommend their special concoction of LOVE JUICE! It's a very refreshing and delicious drink that have you wanting more!The Asst GM, Vik, is a first class ambassador for HRC! He took great care of us when we were there, especially with all the kids of all our friends running around, having fun.Highly recommended
5
My order was served on time and the dish was fantastic from the moment I had the first bite. You can also request for Salsa on the side although the dish tastes good by itself. I don't know about you but I had my Iced Lemon Tea to go with it. UNBELIEVABLE!Need I say More
3
After rocking up without a booking, we were surprised that the venue was able to seat our party of 13, probably because the unwanted table was right next to the stage and although there was no band playing at the moment, we knew it was going to be loud once the music started.Service was prompt and the staff were patient with us as we fumbled through what we wanted to order. The food came out quickly as nobody ordered an entree and they were able to serve all 13 meals all at once, which was impressive.Some of the people in our party ordered the bottomless soft drink option and were forever asking the staff for a top up - a good option if you're thirsty, because every time they came to collect the glasses for a refill, they did it with a smile and came back quickly with another drink.My wife ordered an orange juice, which came in a very small glass and cost $7 and a Caesar salad for mains. I had the lemon iced tea and the tasting plate, which was big enough that I had to share a good portion of it. Our combined bill came to about $75 (including the ++).If you're having a birthday, they bring out a cake for you and get the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday to you - a good reason to keep it a secret if you're celebrating your birthday there - unless you like being the center of attention.Once our meals were done and the band finished tuning their instruments, the music came on and sitting right next to the stage, yes it was loud. We hung around for the first set, listening to soft rock tunes, and a couple of songs from a young boy in the crowd who was known to the band.We probably wouldn't eat here again, only because there are so many other options to try, but it was a good night, thanks to some friendly service and decent food & drinks
5
Top notch service starts the moment you enter the doors of the cafe. The staffs at Hard Rock always makes sure our trip there is worth the while. Food is reasonably priced, with the big American portions that we can never seem to finish. Must try:1. Mud pie2. Burgers3. Thick/Malt shakes4. Macaroni and Cheese5. Wing
1
It is a tired place with very loud music. Hamburger costs a lot and the meat was dry. Even if you were looking for a good ambiance and dim lighting - you'd better off go somewhere.It is too expensive
3
Ordered buffalo wings to go along with the beer.
The buffalo wings were so sour that most of us stop at first bite.
4
The food was okay, but the staff and beer selection were great. I sat at the bar and spoke with the bar tenders and servers the whole night.
5
Excellent service, great cocktails, brilliant food. Highly recommended.
2
Overcrowded and overpriced. We only viited because of the name and it woukd be extremely unlikely that I would visit again
5
good setting just off orchard rd. usual good food and drink selection. friendly staff and good music artefacts.What made this more memorable was the regular live music. really good vibe to an evening.
4
This is a review of theHRC inside changi. Burgers and fajitas are very good here, good change from the overload of Asian food you'll get if you stay long in the area. The memorabilia is nice, but nothing that blew me away. The tv/sound system needs work sadly. The prices are really stee
5
I really enjoyed my time at the Hard Rock Cafe' at Resort World on Sentosa Island. The pricing is what you'd expect, but it's worth spending a little extra for the experience. For those who have never been to a Hard Rock Cafe', think of the place as the ultimage homage to all things music. Memorabilia previously belonging to, or signed by famous artists adorns the walls, as do numerous screens playing performances and songs from times past and present.The food is excellent, the service great and if you've got a knack for souvenirs, why not head over to the Hard Rock Shop joined on to the Cafe' to snag a cool shirt, drinking glass (in a variety of styles, or other such trinkets to remind you of the time you had here). I'd definately go back
4
This was my first time to a hard rock cafe and I did not want to be inundated with a clichÃ©' experience. My experience was really good. We went on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks. The place was lightly packed with large groups generally the norm. We ordered drinks which were very good. I ordered a burger and it was cooked correctly and good. The gem of the evening however proved to be the band. The band started off with a few modern R&B songs and the lead singers (both the guy and the girl) had a good voice and they could carry a tune. The highlight of the evening came when the band invited a young boy from the audience (who had played with them before) and then rocked the whole house with Enter Sandman. The guitarist of the band was truly gifted and knew how to put on a show. In the final song of the night the band played "welcome to the Jungle" and the guitarist in the end did a solo which was a great cap to a wonderful night. Overall I had a great time in the place. I honestly don't know how many times I could replicate this very experience but I think it would be worth a visit to try again
5
It was awesome. The staff were friendly, enthusiastic, and great. The food was at a reasonable price too, and it was delicious. When me & my friends suddenly sang a birthday song to the birthday girl, the staff even sang along. After a few minutes, they got a icecream cup with a candle, and a polaroid camera to help my friend celebrate. They took a free polaroid for us, and even let us enter their bar. Overall, it was an amazing experience. Definitely worth the go
4
If you are tired of walking along Orcahrd Road, go to Hard Rock for a snack. Apart from serving decent food, it also has a good cocktail menu. The staff are very friendly and warm.
5
I am always looking for a good cheeseburger when I travel, and the Hard Rock always delivers with the "Legend Burger"
4
Great food the usual hard rock experience in the Singapore Airport.
5
This place is vibey and it rocks, the day we came there( crew change) seem ed like a party on the go. Have never been there on a boring day, lucky me
4
Good selection of the usual burgers chicken, ribs etc on the menu.
Food was tasty and there was plenty of it.
Service was all right but didn't come with a smile!
5
ambience and friendly staff, family friendly and great food and reasoanable price. My son loves this place and I enjoy it too.
4
Typical American fare that you will find in all Hard Rock Cafes around the world. We go there not only for the food but the rock & roll ambiance. The one in Singapore is on par with the cafes around the world.
4
When you're fed up with the delicious Asian food, its good to get a nice burger or some ribs
5
Great for kids, food is excellent and plentiful, atmosphere is wonderful.
3
As always the food at the Hard Rock Cafe was good. However our service was terrible. After waiting about 10 minutes with no one coming to get our order someone finally showed up. We both ordered drinks (a beer and a iced tea) and ended up having to wait to eat our food because our drinks hadn't been brought to our table yet. We didn't see our server once while eating and then couldn't find him to get the bill. The restaurant was quite slow on a friday evening, so this made it even more shocking that our service was so terrible.
4
Interestingly, no other places in Singapore serve fajita as good as Hard Rock Cafe. This the one thing that keeps me coming back to Hard Rock Cafe
4
service was good. food was awesome.... the company was great!
4
just a minute wlak from this hotel. You can exprerience them within a minute!!! very convenient!!!
2
...but just what you would expect at Hard Rock. Just not my scene anymore.
4
Service and food and location. My first visit to Hard Rock Cafe in singapore and I will return
2
Clearly in decline. Food is not good anymore. The night we were there, there was practically a company function which was like a bad karaoke session - and it was suppose to be on till 2330hrs. That's the end of my evening for a paying customer. Absolute waste of time.
3
Completely not impressed. Although the portion I received was big American sized, it really lacked. I dined solo and could barely hear my waitress over the noise, the tables around me were too busy getting drunk, and I got lots of stares. I kept on being asked if I wanted an alcoholic beverage. Being pregnant I declined every single time. Maybe it was what they waitresses were required to ask, but I hated being asked if I wanted a signature loaded beverage for each part of my order. What part of I'm pregnant and don't drink do they not get

The place was buzzing as it was F1 weekend. The staff were extremely busy but, acknowledged you and kept you going. They were very helpful and happy in their work. Had a great time!

We lucked out and heard a band that was played some pretty good covers of hard and classic rock songs. The food was just ok and pretty overpriced but was ok considering the free entertainment.

I enjoyed the Chili Crab with Chinese Buns , though an appetizer, it was so filling I didn't order my main course anymore.
Got some nice Hard Rock shirts too!

Hard Rock Cafe is Hard Rock Cafe, no matter where you go there in the world. If you need to buy the Singapore version of HRC Shirt it is OK, but for food no need. There are better places to have dinner in Singapore

Stopped at the HRC for dinner and an adult beverage. As is my custom when traveling alone, I sat at the bar for dinner. I met a couple from the UK on their honeymoon and enjoyed their company for several hours while we debated the finer points of English football (soccer) and American football. At around 11 there was a show that was highly anticipated by the all the local patrons. It was a cross dressing song and dance show. Although it was not in English, I could still understand the general theme and laughed when it was supposed to be funny, etc. What started out as a trip down the street for dinner turned into an unexpected and delightful evening

The atmosphere when one first enters the restaurant is very clear. One would immediately think that this is either a concert hall (because of all the guitars hanging on the wall) or a bikers joint (because of the outfits of the waiters). The food at Hard Rock Cafe is very nice and dandy. However, the cost of the food is slightly expensive. I believe that it is due to the quality of the food. I do recommend this place to people who enjoy high quality burgers

This was the quietest Hard Rock I've ever been to, and I've been to quite a lot!It does have a few pieces of memorabilia but it is just a rectangular room with a few tables. Has all the normal food and drinks but really you're better off just going to the shop and buying the tee shirt
3
I thought the food items were barely passable and the decor was a bit drab. The service however was friendly and mostly efficient. Don't make a special trip here. A much better Hard Rock is on Sentosa Island. If you're dying to go to a Hard Rock here, go to that one

Just visited during F1 weekend and found the food and service to be on par with any other Hard Rock Cafe around the world. The only difference being that the drinks are a little more expensive. Same menu, same drinks, same great service................I suggest you come and enjoy and feel safe that you will recieive both good food and service

Everytime we traveled to Singapore we will definitely stopped by Hard Rock Cafe in Changi Airport Terminal 3 Level 3.It is located at a quiet and hidden corner which easily overlooked.But once you find it, it is so convenience as you can get the Singapore Hard Rock T-shirts, if you are lucky enough, you can even get the special edition Changi airport T-shirt cannot be found else where. This trip my hubby managed to get their Formula 1 edition!Price for a lady T-shirt is about S$42.Just beside of the Hard Rock store, it is the cafe which serve varieties of sandwiches, burgers and of course beverages. Amazing airplanes view keep the children busy...Definitely not crowded.The food is usual Hard Rock standard, big portion! If you are small eater, share with your partner.They also have kids menu but the portion is not too small! Another option for small eater.You can eat buy and drink at the same spot. Very easy and convenient

Go for the burgers and ribs; but skip the steaks

Good:some good American style foodgood atmospherehearty portionsjust off Orchard Rdcomedy w Kumar on Monday nightsBad:expensive (like most restaurants in Singapore - as opposed to casual eating spots)It's a good experience, not cheap, but a fun place - especially if you go late monday evenings and catch local comedian Kumar's show! Fun w groups of friends, also a decent lunch spot. Deserves 3.5 stars, would rate it higher if they were a little more reasonable on prices

just off Orchard Road on side road, a busy place, reservation recommended, good food selection (salad), friendly staff, music not too noisy, prices are acceptable, fan store had really reasonable prices compared to other hard rock cafes I visited so far (ca. 35 % lower), overall pleased with ambiente and price

I actually used to the like the HRC Singapore and had been there in the years past. Unfortunately recently their service has really gone down the drain. Slow and worst of all, surly waiters who forget your orders, technical difficulties with their kitchen and even my six year old's complaining about the crayons they hand out. Apparently they use to give a small box of crayons but now just four wrapped in a paper band. I'm never going back. HRC HK is still worth it, though

Not up to standard. I have eaten in several HRC and this one is not recommendable. The food was lousy (I had the burger), the service was average, the music was rubish and so lound that it was really not enojable for dining anymore, the decor is faded. Don't go, there are so many better places to eat in Singapore

Having visited a number of HRC around the world (as a family we make a point of doing so) we were not impressed with the quality of the food (Handburger in Raffles City makes a way-better burger). The problem with the service was that the staff were too attentive i.e. every 3-5 minutes we were being asked if everything was ok; to be honest, it started to annoy us after the second time. I would not visit a second time (unlike NYC or Sydney (before it closed))

The Hard Rock Cafe in Singapore is like a family restaurant ( we may have seen only that aspect of it sine we wnet there for lunch ) - much more a TGIF than an HRC .The decor is also not what you would expect in an HRC and it was also a bit faded .Service was not upto the mark . Food was very very average

As expats living in Singapore we went to Hard Rock for the nachos. We never found another place that compares in the quantity nor taste of nachos. Other food is good too and is consistent with other Hard Rock's. Kids get balloons which is a nice touch
