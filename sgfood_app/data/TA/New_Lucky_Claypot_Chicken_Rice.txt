The rice quality used was poor. Literally their famous claypot chicken was overrated! Their chicken tangy but apart from that nothing to shout out for. Definitely not going there for CLAYPOT chicken rice anymore.

Excellent clay pot rice. Remember to add extra liver sausages, sausages.
Watercress soup is great too.
Value for money.
Call to reserve ahead of time.

One of the better claypot rice in Singapore. You still get the crust but not the burnt. Make sure you have adequate oil and black sauce, yummy!!

Well. not that mom has done this at home but it is the same taste that I had been enjoying all these years. Be prepared to wait during weekends.

First time experience of the chicken claypot rice at the New Lucky Claypot Rice stall in the 44 Holland Drive food court. The waiting time on Sunday 7 pm was 1 hr 30 mins. The foodcourt was almost full . The claypot chicken rice was tasty and delicious with some pieces of salted fish and marinated chicken. The rice was served with an optional thick black sauce. Value for money. However waiting time is a major concern. Luckily there was a famous Rozak Line stall that we bought to eat as Starter while waiting for the claypot rice. Recommended if you were patient and have friends to chat while waiting.

Great claypot rice but minimum wait of 1hr on an early Saturday evening. The hawker centre is relatively well ventilated so the wait is not that bad if you have company. Didn't try the rest of the dishes but they do have soup and vegetables available for ordering. Cheap and good eat.

This is considered Singapore's best claypot rice, which takes a long time to prepare with chicken, sausage and rice steamed together. The end product has a layer of burnt but crispy rice at the bottom that can be washed down with a bowl of hot soup. I prefer this style of cooking to fried rice as it is not greasy at all

Where else can you get such nicely executed claypot rice at $5/pax? Wonderful robust flavour, with tender and fresh chicken pieces cooked just right. Reasonable wait of 30min. Very lucky to have this stall around, considering I did not enjoy Lei Garden Hong Kong 's much touted Claypot rice as much as this (and that one cost a lot more!!)If you don't mind eating like a local in a hawker center, in T-shirt and shorts, and enjoy local prices, this one is for you! You might want to pay a little more for some chicken top up, there's not a lot of chicken, for the base price

I have made several visits to this stall and each time I am left fuming mad at the stupid system that the owners have adopted. Unwitting walk-in customers' orders are taken and cash paid upfront. They are then assigned an order number (don't be misled by the early numbers assigned) and the long wait starts. Orders by customers who had called up in advance are prepared and put aside for their arrival while walk-ins are left waiting despite being present and having paid up.The moment the phone-ins arrived, they are immediately served. And the walk-ins are still waiting and wondering at the process.The food is average and is just not worth the frustration of being passed over in the queue by the dumb serving system

This is an old fashioned dish that is increasingly hard to find in Singapore. The star dish is the claypot rice (with chicken, Chinese sausages and salted fish).Best to eat this dish at the venue (so you can dig into the crusty rice bits at the bottom of the pot). They do a good takeaway too (no crust though).Have also had the soups (watercress and the pork and lotus root one) which are tasty.Go for dinner early as they close early (by 9 pm)
