Located right smack in the middle of the coffee shop is the only "drink" stall you will find in this atas coffee shop. If you want a drink to be paired with your pork knuckle or pasta, there's no teh or kopi or canned drinks. Mostly just fresh fruit juices or pearl milk tea concoctions.1. Sunrise (Apple, Beetroot, Carrot, Ginger) $5 Quite a refreshing drink even though there is ginger in there, definitely could make you feel a little heaty on a hot afternoon. But for a Large drink, this cup size is huge!2. Green Apple Yakult $3.90 Having had hearty fried chicken wings from Two Wings, I decided that I needed some pro-biotics to help with my digestion. You can taste the yakult very subtly with the strong green apple juice. You can tell it is fresh juice, as it is more sour than sweet.3. Green Apple Juice Just a typical cup of freshly squeezed green apple juice. Nothing more basic than that.Since this is your only drink option at this coffee shop, I do feel that they are charging you a slightly premium price. Then again, it is an atas coffee shop, that doesn't sell your typical chai-peng, but mostly ang moh food.The drink stall queue can get quite long, so do take everyone's order at the table and order the drinks just once!

No singapore coffeeshop is complete without a drink stall, and Brown Sugar plays this exact role at Salute Coffeeshop. to wash down greasy but shiok (local slang to describe an experience so great it's beyond pleasant) pork knuckles and chicken wings, have some juice blends. I liked Sunrise, but my partner thought it tasted like dishwashing liquid. Or if you want to sin all the way, order bubble tea (the silky range is my favourite) or even the avocado blends. Yums
