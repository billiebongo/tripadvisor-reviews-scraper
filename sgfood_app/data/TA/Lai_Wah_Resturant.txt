Not been here for almost a year, but standards of food was consistently excellent.I recommend the venison hor fun, 鹿肉河粉, which is not available anywhere else, with its delicious sauce and tender meat.The Steamed Chicken in Special Sauce 玉兰鸡 was impeccably steamed and so smooth that once u have tried it, u realised that all other restaurants' chickens are either too tough or too salty.The fish, vegetables, noodles were all equally delicious and yummy. We look forward to their CNY dishes

Lai Wah Restaurant Located at Blk 44 Bendemeer Road, Singapore. Small & tight restaurant, the Decor is dated and dining in this restaurant It’s like going back into the Ming Dynasty, even the staff and the cutlery seems outdated. Anyway Decor is dated but the food is good. We ordered quite a few of their signature dishes, such as yam ring , Claypot eggplant with salted fish, stir fry vege with garlic ,roasted chicken and all were aptly captivated. Lastly, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The tab was expensive but for the flavour and dining comfort, I return next time I am in the neighbourhood

Review by Dr Sim. The Cantonese food is pretty good. However, the service is below average. The ambience is basic and average. Tourist would need to know Mandarin or Cantonese. Better get a local to bring you. Famous Cantonese actors have eaten in the restaurant. Try the chicken, yam basket, salted egg york squid. Regards Dr Si

This is an old established restaurant, we have reserved few days in advance and there are people queuing up outside the restaurant. It is full house in the restaurant and we have booked to celebrate my mother and brother birthday. They do offered set meal as well, since we have 7 pax, we ordered set meal for 4-5 person plus additional ala carte items. The serving is fast, food are delicious, especially the crispy chicken, will definitely go back to try on its other dishes, a gem in Boon Keng area. Just be reminded that you need to reserve in advance, food is cheap and for 7 pax only cost $134 and food is in big portion. Highly recommended

The restaurant is housed inside a non-descript shop house at Bendemeer Road. It was founded in 1963 & is now run by the descendants of the late founder. It offers no- frills home style Cantonese cuisine in an authentic 1980s restaurant setting. The restaurant claimed to have invented the Yam Pot with Shredded Meat aka Yam basket with cashew nuts in the 1960s. It also claimed to have invented Yu-Sheng and Mandarin Stewed Chicken. The 8 of us enjoyed the food very much; every dish had adequate 'wok hei'. Even the red bean soup dessert was great; it wasn't too sweet. My only complaint is that all our dishes can very fast. As we could only focus on one dish at a time, the other dishes grew cold in the meantime. Caveat: make reservation in advance as it is very popular. It was very crowded on that Saturday evening when we had dinner there

Chinese New Year celebrations are never complete without the original yusheng from Lai Wah since it was first created in Singapore in 1964! The sauce and freshness of the ingredients are amazing, and after mixing, the combination of everything entices our senses visually, aromatically and tasting. Too bad it is available for only 3 weeks out of 365 days.The signature venison horse fun, yam pots, Steamed chicken, Imperial pork ribs are all cooked with lots of wok hei and consistently yummy. Prices are affordable too, and without service charges.

The dinner at Lai Wah Restaurant was as much a history lesson as a culinary journey. An evening's conversation with one of the matured female staff revealed the restaurant's stature in the local Chinese restaurant scene in the 1960s and 1970s. It's original main branch was the venue of business functions, family events and wedding dinners of the affluent Singapore Chinese back in those days. The remaining branch in Bendemeer also retains the original menu and photos from that period.What was interesting from the culinary point of view was that several of the popular dishes in the 1960s and 1970s are still available today. The cooking techniques and flavor profiles have also been handed down. We ordered a cross spectrum of dishes from that era like Mandarin Stewed Chicken and Special Bean Curd with Crab Meat and mixed in with signatures like Yam Basket with Prawns and Cashew Nuts and Crispy Squids with Salted Egg Yolk. We also ordered a roast duck and prawns with an old fashion black sauce. Nothing disappointed. With such a spread amounting to less than $30 per person, I would label this place as cheap eats compared to other Chinese restaurants. Guess I'll have to order up another round of Singaporean Chinese nostalgia the next time I'm in town

We came for a quick seven course lunch menu. Had the fried chicken, fried Barramundi in soya sauce, yam ring, mixed vegetables, cubes venison in black pepper sauce and Ee Fu noodles. Service was good and homely.

Our table of guests included 70% of newcomers to Lai Wah. Everyone was impressed and loved the food, we finished all the food. Try the signature venison hor fun, yam basket, steamed chicken, and crispy prawns!

Old school family restaurant. Love the food here, everything well cooked and delicious. Have been dining here since the early 1980s with my daddy and returning annually for Chinese New Year celebration/Reunion Dinner.

This place has been around for decades but still dependable for good old fashioned Cantonese food. Their venison dish and yam basket and especially their crispy skin chicken are exceptionally good.

Lai Wah is an institution in Singapore for classic Cantonese food. Always good place to come for old fashion comfort food like crispy skin chicken, venison hor fun, yam basket. Pretty good place to have lunch on weekdays as it is not so crowded

A friend recommended this place as it has been his go to restaurant for his family dinner for the past 2 decades.The cereal prawns, roasted chicken and garoupa are tasty and not expensive.I will return to this place as I want to try their signature dish where half of the fish is fried and the remaining is steamed.

Lai Wah was founded back in 1963 by one of the "4 Heavenly Chefs", and is now run by the son of one of the chefs. The restaurant is under a Housing Development Board (HDB) block of flats, and stepping into this air-conditioned eatery is like stepping back into the 80s. The food is charming, somewhat rustic Cantonese food, which tastes good and gives one an insight into the type of restaurant our parents might have enjoyed great food in. You can order a la carte or a set menu. The two times I ate there, we tried two different set menus. The highlights for me were the salt and pepper roast chicken, the deep fried bean curd with squid paste filling, and one of their signature dishes, the stir-fried venison hor fun (flat rice noodles). The wait staff are friendly and ever helpful, and like days of yore, they provide you with a complimentary endless flow of Chinese tea, orange squash or water. There is no corkage charge, but the wine drinker is best advised not only to BYO (only beer is sold here), but to also being along your own stemware; unless you like your wine out of a tumbler (see picture). :)Overall a gem of a find, and for those seeking for a taste of 70s-80s Singapore, look no further than this restaurant.

An “old-school” restaurant with close link to the traditional 4 Heavenly Kings chef (of whom Two Kings were at Lai Wah Restaurant.) of Singapore Cantonese culinary（ 饮食界 四大天王）! Good food promised!My parents used to like the place and nostalgia bring us here, often!.Better to make reservation else you may get disappointed. .Our group of 8 visited during dinner time on a Saturday and all the tables are filled by 7pm. WE ordered their specialty of Yam Pot/basket with Shredded Yam Cake (佛钵飘香), Boiled boneless Chicken with Kai Lan 火腿玉兰鸡, and crispy cereal prawns to name a few. We also tried out the signature venison hor fun and noodle (什锦伊面 & 河粉) too.Arrived after 20 mins and served progressively with minimum break. Simply love the food here, cooked well and taste delicious.. Never disappoints with its distinctive "Wok hei" （锅气）, good standard! Just a bit noisy due to the tight layout of the place, but it meant fun and you are in the right place!!.This place has been around for decades but still dependable for good old fashioned Cantonese food.. Especially famous for its raw fish dish (yusheng) for Chinese New Year dinner. Just noted that the prices have edged higher slightly since our last visit 6-mths back, thought still reasonable. P.S. Must make reservation for its chilli crab

There were a couple of times when visited on Saturday nights but they were full, so it has been a while since we last visited. This time, we made sure we made a reservation before turning up. As usual, the guests seemed to be regulars. We ordered the roasted fried chicken, fried salted pork chop, nonya style vegetables, foo yoong egg omelette, braised bean curd with crab meat, and hor fun. The tofu, vegetable and pork chop dishes were done differently from other restaurants, but delicious. The omelette and fried chicken were good too. Seldom mentioned for this restaurant but the hor fun was excellent. The restaurant is something interesting. Other than the ceiling air-conditioners, the decor appears to be from the 70s/80s and said time stood still. Do visit this place if you get a chance - the food is good and prices reasonable.

Food here has always been consistently good since I started eating here as a kid. The yusheng, which was 1st created here in Singapore in 1964, still tastes the best! The Imperial Pork Ribs, chickens, Yam Baskets, Venison Hor Fun are all signature dishes. Prices are very affordable
