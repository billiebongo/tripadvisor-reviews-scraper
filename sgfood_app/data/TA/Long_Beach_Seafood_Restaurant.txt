Got invited by some Singapore colleagues. Food was excellent, service great, very efficient and friendly. Quantities were perfect and price was really ok. Will come back.

Long Beach Seafood in Singapore was a great experience with exceptional food!!! We sat at an outdoor table overlooking the water. Lively music was playing as we feared on amazing seafood!!! I highly suggest the pepper crab (see my photo) it was fabulous!!!!

I'm not much of a crab person, but when I had the garlic crab and the famous chili crab from this place, I must say I'm now more willing to try it! Best when paired with beer.

Great dining experience at Long Beach IMM outlet.Food is served piping hot, seafood tastes very fresh. Service is really awesome, we are impressed by Asst Mgr Ms Zhuang Ou Ting's warm hospitality & professionalism, all staff are helpful and wearing a pleasant smile, which really makes our day. Look forward to next visit there

I went to this restaurant with family. The food is great and the service is good. I went on a weekday so it was not so crowded but I heard that its a crowded restaurant and well-known for the yummy food. My brother told me that the main restaurant is in the East Coast. Had a great family dinner

Good service. Had some dim sum , not fantastic; this is a seafood restuarant after all.The chilly mud crab at $76 for about 900g was delicious and fresh. Remember to order mantou to go with the chilly gravy. We had also mee sua with crab meat ; disappointing and too oily and the crabmeat is lost in the egg white. The bill came up to about $40 per head

This was my second visit to its IMM branch. Last round had their famous black pepper crab & chilli crab. This time tried their family set to celebrate Father's Day. Total of 6 dishes with dessert. Our tummies were satisfied & heart were bless with the great service

I'm very particular about food especially crab. So I always choose the best place to have my crab. I gotta tell u this is the best place to have your meal! Order the black pepper crab, kangkong and fried rice. All the food is delicious and superb which deserve 5star! I have never done any review in my country restaurant and for this they deserve my best review. And the waiter and server, working today after 6pm on 10March. Thank you for the great service. I really appreciate their service. Very attentive and polite, fast and efficient with a smile on your face. As a non Chinese, I can't speak mandarin, usually at other Chinese restaurant in Singapore most speak in Chinese and the English is hard for me to understand but here, everyone speak well. Thank you so much Long Beach.

We booked this place for a company dinner cause it's one of the restaurants that opened till 11pm. We can only start from 9pm. As it was late we were the only patrons in the restaurant. They were rushing towards the end which I can understand, everyone wants to go home. But it's really ok. The food quality was good and tasty. The only drawback was the food was served rather fast and thus, did not really enjoy the dinner
4
Nice cozy atmosphere. There are private rooms that can sit 4-5 tables.
The crab dishes are fantastic.
5
Was invited to lunchtme meeting, Took a whle to locate restaurant, direction signs not very clear. The set lunch was delicious and the service prompt. I enjoyed the noodles, fish and dimsum.
4
I visited this restaurant for business meeting. The restaurant is at IMM mall and it is bit far from Jurong East MRT. Food here was really nice, but the price was bit expensive.
IMMにある小奇麗なレストランです。　味はよかったですが、少し高いのが難点なのと、駅から遠いところでしょうか。
2
The skin for the Har Gow (prawn dumpling) and scallop dumpling is too thick. Liu Sha Bao is so tiny and seems like those frozen ones you can buy from the supermarket. Tried various other dim sum dishes that were average to poor. Expensive. Can't recommend
3
A very dull atmosphere if any , deco and lighting not very welcoming ! Grossly overpriced ! Was told that the traditional crab (for whatever reason called Sri Lanka crab) is no more available on the menu !! Does it mean that the Sri Lanka crabs have vanished from the face of earth or what is it ? ... Instead they propose Alaska crab !!! (nothing to do with the traditional Singapore Chili and black pepper crabs! ). By the way I never heard anywhere that an Alaska crab can be degraded and punished with chili and/or black pepper sauce !!! And priced at a staggering price of S$ 178,- ++ per kg (that is US $ 125,- ++ per kg) . Insane ! Only show-off type of people will go for such prices! Such people would put authentic caviar together with authentic duck or goose liver foie gras on a pork chop with baked beans

Want for a small family reunion last night at Long Beach East Coast branch.Though I normally give restaurants benefit of doubt if one or even two dishes is poor, unfortunately I have to say last night was very mediocre.Pro:1. Service stuff were good, friendly and attentive2. Wash area was relatively clean (pls understand it's normal to have wet floor due to sheer number of crab eaters)3. The crispy baby octopus was the saving grace of the evening. Caramelized sweet coating was a good, with a subtle hint of heat. A splash of lime would be perfect for meCon:1. The set meal's veg was cold at service2. Pepper crab (main reason for going) was disappointing to say the least. The pepper seems to be added as an afterthought, with crab meat dry and tasteless.3. Steamed fish had a sour aftertaste (I don't mean like Teochew style with plum)4. Very obvious that the portions have gotten a lot smaller, which I do not mind. Except the prices has proportionally increased in the same ratio.Summary:Extremely disappointed with one of the "Legend" seafood restaurant I grew up with.It pains me to say that I would not recommend going, until improvements are made to quality of dishes and value for money

I am a regular at this restaurant...by this I mean been 3 - 4 times a year. I just had a lunch gathering for 6 with my family and relatives. The staff were familiar and friendly. They did not really recognize me or call me by name but they still make me feel at home nonetheless.Simply, their willingness to engage dine-in customer with little jokes and small talk helped. Their friendliness and smiley faces settled in my guests, and quick to attend to our requests. Not just today...I recall that this was the case every other time I was there.I don't always eat at Seafood Restaurants but when I do want to bring guests to have a good seafood experience, I think of Long Beach... IMM if that's the central place for my invitees

My family of 6 adults and 2 young kids had our lunch at the Long Beach Seafood Restaurant located at Jurong East Street 21 #03-07 IMM Building, Singapore. The Restaurant specializes in Chinese Cuisine and is the creator of the original Black Pepper Crab. My family enjoyed our lunch as the food was good. Worth checking it out when you are shopping at the new Jurong East Shopping Belt

Had reunion dinner for 9 adults and 1 toddler - went for a mixed of set menu and à la carte items. It was a value-for-money dinner and my folks enjoyed the meal. What was particularly impressive was the Claypot Fish Soup in place of the usual steam / fried fish dish in reunion dinner set menus. We loved it so much that we had to place additional à la carte order for it and we were surprised that for a big pot (sufficient for almost 6-7 adults) costs only $50. The fish (approximately 800g) was fresh and the soup was really tasty! Liked the fact that the fish was fried prior to cooking it in the soup. The amount of ginger and other spices was appropriately added and was refreshing yet not too overwhelming. The portion for other dishes served was definitely more than what we paid for, hence for a family with big eaters, it was definitely very worth it. Waitresses were also very friendly and it was nice to see some very long-time waitresses who were there since the very beginning

We have been visiting this branch at IMM since 2013. When we first visited, we went with the black pepper crab and really loved it more compared to the chilli crab that we had previously tried over at one of the other famous Singapore establishments. Since then, we have always stuck with black pepper crab but this time we decided to also try the chilli crab. Its probably just our preference as spicy food lovers so we still think black pepper crab was better. However, we did discover a new taste: dipping the fried buns in chilli crab sauce. The buns were fantastic and go really well with the mildly sweet, spicy and tangy sauce of chilli crab. The service is usually very good. The waiters and manager are always attentive. The ambience is not fancy but very clean. The atmosphere is kind of family like and the staff are friendly in a very personable way. The manager remembered us although we visited probably after a year or so. We paid $70 per kg of crab which is lower than some other comparable places. Overall, we always enjoy the visit and hope to come back later

Had a dinner meal here. Attended a celebration.
The food tastes decent, not bad.
Service was quite attentive and prompt too.
Ambience was good.
A great place for family meet-ups or company meals.
2
Extremely expensive and low quality food - standard has drop a lot. They have pretty good selections of food but I still think it is super overpriced.
2
Disappointing service and their "$75 premier discount card" no good on first visit. Black pepper crab and chili crab are over-priced for the quantity you receive. The service wasn't anything to write home about, either.
3
Had a dinner gathering there for 7 of us including a baby. Service was good, manager was prompt n attentive. Waitress was helpful to adjust our seating for the baby. The seafoods were quite alright overall. What caught my eye was the bill of $600. And yes, I am a VIP Card member now. Price was rather high for the dinner
3
Went there for lunch with my family. We always love Seafood from Long Beach at other branches. The food at imm long beach was served hot and in good portion. However, it was not as delicious as those served in Dempsey. Service was attentive. Price was high.
3
We ordered drunken prawns, fried dough with meat, spinach soup, spring chicken and coffee ribs. For a simple dinner it comes out to about $150, that's $30 per head. The taste and portions for the dishes were just enough. You would want to skip the coffee ribs as it leaves a sourish taste after eating - maybe too much coffee. Use to serve better food and choices
2
Extremely expensive place compared to other seafood outlets in Singapore. For the price paid, I should not be eating red tilapia which has been given some exotic fanciful name.Certainly felt ripped off after the meal! Not even worth a mention, not to say a second visit!

Well, the new hotel in the west of Singapore has just opened for business, and it's pretty close by, so it's probably only a matter of time before tourists start to look for a good Chinese restaurant to dine at when the 'heartland' hawker entrÃ©e seemed like calorie overload. But hey, we've only just started: you are going to get more sinful treats here and they are worth it. The fish we had was really fresh, so too the salted yolk/cereal prawns (my favorite!) The waiting staff were really polite and that's always good. 10% service charge and 7% tax apply. :
4
The place is usually packed for dinner. I must say one of the best pepper crabs I have eaten to date. We ordered chilly prawns along with steamed buns they were also delicious. Overall a good experience but at times I feel the stewardess get a bit grumpy and that puts you off. The portions are fine but I did feel it is a bit pricey..
5
I was taken there by my colleagues in Singapore. They treated me with a set menu but changed the crap to a bigger one. The black pepper chili crab was simply outstanding, the best crab that I ever had. I also tried the same crab in two other places later on, none of them could compare with the one I had in Long Beach. It was not cheap but definitely worth every penny. The waitress were also very attentative and competent

This is one of the famous seafood restaurants in Spore.
Good and delicious food though a bit more expensive.
Staff service reasonable.

This is the Long Beach Seafood one inside the IMM mall.We ordered a "5/6 person family set dinner" plus a dish of deer meat. Overall most dishes tasted fine. The deer meat was tender. The portions were however much smaller than I expected for the price. The spinach dish was so little it's pathetic. Total bill including 10% service charge was US $262 (7 dishes total). The family set dinner was designed for 5 to 6 persons. Waitress kept telling us that it would be enough for the 7 of us. It was a good thing that we ordered the extra deer meat dish and together was just barely enough.Service was good but sporadic at times. Restaurant only allowed 1 pot of tea for each table. I asked to get another pot with extra payment but it was turned down. This is extremely unusual for Chinese restaurant (whether in Hong Kong or in USA). Then they didn't leave the pot on the table. Instead they would bring it to refill our cups. That's again extremely unusual. It would be fine except that I drank a lot quickly and kept waiting for refill, very annoying and totally inefficient. The prepackaged wet napkins provided at table were not free, S$3 each. We certainly didn't expected that. The weird thing is that, as fancy as this restaurant, they didn't provide any cloth or paper napkin at all, again very unusual
5
We had a 1.4kg crab in white pepper which is surprising very good. The pepper sauce did not drown the sweet flavor of crab meat which was firm and succulent. Waitress Carol Liaw recommended their Goby Marble 700g fish cooked in herbal Claypot, it was absolutely yummy. The fish meat was smooth and soft and the soup was fragrant. She also recommended baby pacific clam at sgd5 a piece, steamed with garlic shallots and vermicelli. Lastly asparagus in sambas was okay. All for reasonable price of sgd237 for 3pax.the best part was when Carol offered to peel the crab she'll for us, it was my first experience of such a service. Very much appreciated.will come back again

Had a family dinner in the Longbeach seafood restaurant. The food quality is good and the staff is very cooperative and friendly...they sang birthday song for my 3 year old and prepared the cake for cutting..Location 7/10Quality of food - 8/10Service - 9/10Price - 7/10 (10 people for SGD 350)Return - YE
3
Surprisingly pretty empty place when we arrived at 8pm for dinner, only four tables of dinners out of (roughly) 24 tables in the restaurant were occupied.Ordered Deer Meat with Ginger, Baby ribs with Honey and Chinese Spinach with Trio-eggs. All turned out to be pretty good tasting since they are all non-seafood dishes in a seafood restuarant - only shortcoming is that the Baby ribs with Honey was a tad too salty
4
Went to this local outlet on a Monday night, and it was not crowded. What it lacks in ambience, it makes up in service. All the foods were very fresh and excellently prepared. Staff helped select menu items to suit my ' can't take heat" requests. Butter and cream crab and mango pudding were memorable
3
I've always only had their crabs (love their pepper crabs) and other seafood items like razor clams, prawns and fish before but this time, the visit was for their lesser cholesterol-laden Chinese fare.What we ordered: A cold dish platter comprising jelly fish, ngoh hiang (deep fried five spiced meat rolls) and crispy meat-stuffed wantons, roasted chicken, lala beehoon, garlic baby kailan and fried tofu. Verdict: The good - all dishes were well cooked and tasted nice. The bad - you can get similar at lower cost zhi-char eateries.Service was very good. Although the restaurant was packed, staff were attentive and polite, food came quickly, empty and dirty plates cleared at the right time and tea and water were refilled frequently without having to ask. While the restaurant's decor is pleasant, bright and clean (was there at lunchtime), it suffers from poor sound insulation, a common issue with many other restaurants too actually. As the restaurant filled up, ambient noise levels rose, to the point where practically every diner was raising his/her voice to be heard, worsening the sound situation (it was not difficult to clearly overhear business talk and politics being discussed at tables next to mine).If not for high prices, average to slightly above average non-seafood dishes and very poor sound insulation, I would rate this place one notch higher as seafood and service are very good

The food was nice, the service was very attentive , the environment during the day is good as it has big windows and a lot of lights in. At night , it gives a different impression. Good option if you are around.A set meal during lunch time, I could not finish all tastings. If you try to eat everything, when the crab comes in , you are not able to tackle....

Our colleagues have actually wanted to try the Dempsey outlet but was surprised it was fully reserved on a Thursday evening so we decided to drop by this branch as its under the same famous Long Beach seafood Restaurant chain. While it does not boast the better ambience/view of Dempsey nor East Coast but we are here for the FOOD anyway!It was more than Â½ full when we reached at about 6:30pm. We ordered both the signature Black pepper crab & chili crab, each about 1.2kg. And mine you they are both delicious in their own ways.! Personally I still prefer chilli crab cause I like to dip the man dou (fried bread) with the spicy gravy. The herbal drunken prawn was also good. Tried the soup which is tasty (a pity the waitress is not sure what was the type of herbal used..). For vegetable we chose the clay pot mushroom and baby cabbage, and o-mind it was served hot! .We also tried the dessert (mango pudding, teochew omni, ice-cream), all not bad. The dishes were all served quite promptly, considered that the crowd has since arrived then. We were not disappointed with all the dishes. Service is good, the waiter make sure that our plates are changed frequently and also top-up our tea timely.. A pity that they do not provide a bib nor (transparent) hand glove while we ate the crabs. Overall, we still had an enjoyable meal and good dining experience. Worth the visit

As compared to their Dempsey outlet, this branch was more spacious, staffs sported a smile and the service was excellent. We had a private room for our group and was catered to very nicely. As for the food, it was fresh and tasty. The chilly crab was spicy compared to the ones I have tasted before and did proper justice to its name. The pepper crab was slightly dry and could have been better. The rest of the stuff was pretty alright.Overall a nice experienc

Very warm welcome from friendly staff of long beach seafood restaurant with nice selection of cuisines...food was very good in taste with reasonable price to portions,...staff took good care of our choices n taste..personal space with good ambience which was very calm and spacious

This was a scheduled family dinner with my mother's birthday just around the corner. As we decided to embark on a seafood expedition this time and the craving for crabs, Long Beach IMM was the one.I must say the attentiveness of the staffs was fantastic, everytime we had a sip of our chinese tea, there would be an elderly part-time lady that was sharp as a hawk and would top up our cups with fresh hot tea! The staff were very accommodating and gave us space and time to think what we wanted to have.We then decided to have the usual spread of what every asian family would have and the food did not disappoint. What I want to say was that everytime when the food arrived, the server would politely enquire if he could portion out the food for us in a plate/bowl, even for the Chilli Crab, they helped with the shells and all we needed to do was DIG IN!!Good Job! The family loved it
5
Excellent Pepper Crab, very attentive staff and a very enjoyable meal.I have been to Long Beach restaurant in East Coast before in the evening and it was really busy so I decided to try their Jurong venue, it was much less crowded than East Coast.The staff were exceptional in catering for special dietary needs, I have to have a gluten free diet due to Coeliac Disease and the restaurant modified some ingredients to cater for this, many places would not do this

Had dinner at Long Beach IMM. We ordered cereal prawn, chilli crab, roast chicken and spinach in trio egg. Overall food is good, especially roast chicken. Was a little dissapointed with chilli crab as i have tasted the one @ their branch in dempsey and it is definitely could be better. Service is excellent, the waiter make sure that our plates are changed frequently and top up our tea timely. The manager of the day , Miss Carol Liew also was very friendly. Overall, we had a good dining experience.More reviews and photos @http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/05/eat-long-beachimm-singapore.htm

We booked a table on Mother's Day, but was given a table near the payment counter with lots of people walking around, we requested to change our table to a table behind the one we were being directed. But the Manager declined and didn't accept our simple request. The Sri Lankan Crab that we ordered was not fresh, the crab was being freezed or refrigerated cause the crab meat was rather loose and soft and the cost of one crab cost $74, which was not worth it. The waiters and waitress are good, just that the Manager not flexible and no foresight
4
Rally good crab, both pepper or Chile....lots of traditional Singapore seafood dishes. Excellent cold beer in a very nice location. You can eat indoor or out but since it was so hot we ate inside and with the downpours we are glad we did. The soups are nice. Service is okay, especially when busy but the Dempsey site is a better alternative to the crabs than the Quay section of the cit
4
I really liked the food. The staff made me feel like I was at their house. They divided up the dishes so it was easier for a big group to get some of each dish. I didn't give it an excellent rating because the restaurant is a little dated or under furnished for this level of restaurant
2
The first thing that I saw when I stepped into the restaurant was a dirty plate,the plate was stained with a sticky yellow substance.Secondly,the tables and cutlery are not really take care of and the amibance was not good.The place was also very noisy.I will not recommend this place and I will only come here if it is the last resort
4
Very crowded on a Sat dinner, booked in advance and hence didn't wait very long to get our table. The whole restaurant was flooded with people, very noisy and staff had to rush here and there to serve so many people. Service level is rather good for such crowded evening. I even saw a waitress patiently helping a customer cracking her crab! Thumbs up. Dishes ordered were served promptly. Plastic gloves provided for crab eaters. Food quality not bad. Worth the visit

Yes, If you want to eat big Sri Lankan crabs, Long Beach Seafood Restaurant in Singapore is one place where you find them! There are a few branches but usually we go to the one at IMM as it's close to where we live. Reservation in advance is a must, especially during the weekends. For a few persons, you can get a crab which weighs about 1.6 kg. There is a lot of succulent meat in that one crab. Although chilli crabs (cooked in a chilli sauce) are quite popular, we prefer black pepper crabs (cooked with coarsely ground black pepper). Usually this is accompanied by steamed rice (or bread, if you prefer). Their "sambal Kang kung"(green leafy vegetable) is quite tasty. Our favourites are pork ribs, baby sotong,(baby squid), venison and abalone. They are not cheap but it is value for money. Even though the restaurant is packed most of the time, the service is quite good
