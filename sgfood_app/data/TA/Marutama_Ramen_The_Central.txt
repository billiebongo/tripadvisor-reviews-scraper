One of the best ramen around and reasonably priced. The soup is simply delicious and not too oily. The greens are abundant and well sliced. The meat is tender and tasty. All in all, the best combo all together.

My friend and I toured around Singapore and walked a while. He recommended this one for dinner. Indeed it is a Japanese Ramen even though the owner is Chinese. Noodle and soup are delicious. We order some side dishes. It is a good dinner.

Contrary to most other Japanese Ramen shops in Singapore which serve mainly pork bone soup, Marutama Ramen serves chicken soup base which is their signature. It is really thick and rich texture. However, I would still prefer the pork bone soup.

Family and I really enjoy the ramen both at Liang Court and Central. Their ramen never fail to satisfy especially the spicy one. Would definitely recommend Marutama.

I didnt have to queue as my dinner was rather late this time. Theres sesame seeds on the table but I dont see the roasted garlic which an earlier reviewer said that both sesame and roasted garlic were placed on the table.Food- its chicken broth ramen. Broth itself was tasty, I finished almost all of it. Meat was delicious.Service- Attentive.Place - Located at the central on the 3rd storey. Closest station is clark quay station. Value - Theres 10% service charge and 7%GST which will be added to your bill. For just 2 mains, its about $30 for 2 pax

We tried the Central Affair Ramen and found it to be abit salty and bland. We added the given condiments such as sesame seeds and garlic chips to enhance the flavor. We ordered the Yaki Grilled Pork Belly which came with a pinch of red crushed chilli flakes and a slice of lemon. The fatty park of the pork belly melts in your mouth while you get the smokey flavor from the charred parts of the meat. It was so good that we ordered another serving of it

It might be that they did not give me the spicy option (which I asked for), but the broth, although having good delicate flavours, was not as rich as I like and different to what I remember from Liang Court. The rest of it was great, fairly firm noodles and lots of great pork and a good egg. The price is ok for Singapore given the size of the meal

Ramen places have come and gone, and more keep popping up. But for me, this is the only Ramen place I keep coming back to all these years. Perfect soup base, perfect noodlesPros+ Perfect soup base, subtle umami flavour. Probably the best in SG (at least for me)+ Firm, succulent noodles (I haven't found any better in SG)+ Best Tamago in town! Soft texture with the right amount of saltiness+ Optional extra helping of noodles+ Greens (not sure what they are) are a nice addition+ Side dishes are all quite nice as wellCons- Fewer branches now?- Other soup bases like the spicy one, etc not up to the standard of the original Chicken soup bas

Strangely enough , this is my third visit here. Never in my previous visit dos it left a deep impression. And I wonder why . I am a big ramen fan . This is the best ramen I have tasted on Singapore. The chicken base soup is fantastic . I prefer more springy and thicker noodle but that is fine as the soup was truly fantastic. I will come back again and again

Very good ramen with chicken broth, which is lighter than Santouka for instance (pork based broth). I still have a slight preference for Santouka, but Marutama is great and i like the roasted garlic + sesame that they put at disposal on the table. The restaurant i went to was on the 3rd floor of Clarke Quay Central Mall.

I go here almost every time I visit Singapore and it has always been great, both the ramen and the gyoza are excellent

I wouldn't eat in any other ramen place but this. The best seller is the all toppings chicken soup at 19$. It comes with very thin noodles, spring onions, seaweed, char siew pork, stewed pork and a flavored egg. You can also ask for the spicy version, which I really suggest. You won't get disappointed

I always come to Marutama whenever I visit Singapore, it's literally the best ramen I've ever had. They've maintained a good standard for over the years. Used to come to the place at least once a month when I studied in Singapore. And everyone I took to the place are also in love with their ramen

Woah... I'm a Ramen Hunter and this is one of the must try ramen. The taste is different from japan ramen but it is so unique and special. I like the chicken soup and I always ask to go for spicy but less spice. Because the soup with little spice make it better for me. I came here on 9 Aug which is Singapore National Day and after the good meal I went to watch fireworks. Also the noodle look like supermarket packet noodle but it is not! it taste real good with the soup. I realise Marutama ramen standard varies among different shop and so far this is my favourite! Also, you can add their fried onion on the ramen. The gyoza is also one of the hot favourite. The store come with free serving of ice water too. This is my hot favourite ramen store

The specialty here is their chicken broth. Noodles are thin and springy, chicken broth has a nice sweetness. Only wished ramen here (and in Singapore generally) was cheaper. I got the basic Marutama ramen and it only came with 1 slice of pick (and some chopped veges and spring onions). Added an egg to it and the total bill came up to $17.05, including service charge and gst. Can't believe I paid more than $10 for a bowl of noodles with hardly any protein.

A different spin on ramen is served here. Instead of pork bone (tonkatsu) broth, they serve chicken broth ramen.Ordered the basic Marutama Ramen. The soup was rather rich and oily for a chicken broth, not as clear and liquid as I had expected. Marutama prides itself on cloudy chicken broth, but I did not know they meant THIS cloudy. :oNoodles were nice, decently springy with some bite to it. The egg was also well done - runny in the middle, as it should be.A number of my party also ordered the Full Marutama Experience. This comes with the regular noodles, spring onions, pork slices, pork belly, seaweed, and an egg. It also comes with some regret at being unable to finish such a monster

One of the few restaurants which serves ramen in chicken soup. Visited this place several times and I would recommend the original marutama ramen or kara ramen if you prefer some spiciness in your noodles. Add on the egg (hard boiled with soft yolk).Service staff are friendly and prompt. Try to avoid peak hours as there might be some waiting time

The best ramen I've had in Singapore! Really, really loved the ramen in this restaurant! I ordered karashi ramen with ajitsuke tamago en yaki gyoza as a side dish. Which was plenty of food to keep me going for a long time. The boiled and marinated egg was simply a delight. The yolk was perfectly cooked: still soft and runny.Service was friendly and most importantly for a ramen restaurant very efficient. Highly recommend this restaurant to ramen lovers from all over the world. A warning though: at lunch time this place can get very crowded

We were the first ones to arrive at this ramen shop which was recommended by our friend. The food itself was good - the broth was rich and tasty, the noodles very bouncy and the char siu tasty. The part which disappointed was the "service". We had to repeat our order at least three times to the lady - two ramens with one extra serving of egg and one extra serving of char siu. The bill was also slightly pricey.The ambiance of the restaurant was good but it wouldn't be a place we will be returning to in a hurry

This ramen taste good although the broth are not so thick. The price very affordable for a bowl of Ramen in Singapore especially since the location is at Clarke Quay area. THe place can get very crowded during lunch time due to plenty of staffs working around the area might come and eat. Worth visit if you only want to eat ramen with good quality
