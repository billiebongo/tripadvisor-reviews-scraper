Totally chill place to eat outside with Singaporeans. You know it has to be good if the locals are there and the place is still buzzing at 10p. Atmosphere is extremely casual, outdoor dinning with a variety of vendors.

We went with local friends to this "Hawker" market. There are about 50 tiny stalls around the outside of the circle selling all kinds of food. There are several hundred tables with fixed umbrellas and stools inside. Every stall holder beckons you towards them. Mrs Vicar wanted Nazi Goreng but this appeared to be the one thing we couldn't find. We settled on some very large prawns which were sold by the weight. These were served butterfly style with garlic or cheese and were delicious with some fried rice. We also had a plum / lime drink which seemed to taste saltier as you reached the bottom.It was a fairly busy week night and tourists only looked like 15% of the customers like earlier comments. You order the food at the stall and you don't pay until you receive it at the table

The locals tell me that there are better Hawker Centres and that this is where the tourists go but frankly that's the point. It's large and varied. Good to go with a local as they can help chose and steer you in the direction of choosing something different like Curried Fish Head. Half the time we were not entirely sure was was chosen for us but we loved the variety all the same. Simply chose what you want from various stalls and eat at the tables in the middle. Place was apparently quieter than normal due to the Haze situation. Fun place and would have eaten there more often if aloud, especially because of the price

Pretty touristy hawker stall but worth it! I have been here twice and always enjoyed the chilli crab. There are plenty of stalls to choose from, just find one you like order you food and sit down. Drinks lady will find you - order a large beer with an ice bucket and prepare to get messy
