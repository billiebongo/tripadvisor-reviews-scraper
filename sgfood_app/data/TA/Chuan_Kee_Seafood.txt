Delicious drunken prawns. Savory omelette. The black pepper crab was just deliciously mad. Spicy and succulent. Get ready to get your hands dirty!! The egg crab was a nice ending as it helped balance the palette perfectly. The broth from the drunken prawns were super - gave you energy. Definitely going back!

Every time we exit the ECP/AYE at Delta to head towards Delta/Alexandra Rd, we always drive past this few blocks of industrial blocks and noticed that there is a small food court/canteen area serving food. It seem quiet and we though it serves the people working in that industrial estate. Lately, we noticed more lights and banners and more activity at the eating area and noticed the words "泉記“ so we googled to get more info. Finally gave it a try over this recent weekend (6 Aug).Did a take-away of fish head curry, prawn ball (he-chor), their house special deep fried toufu, deep fried fish skin seasoned with salted egg coated, spinach with 3 types of eggs (regular/salted/century), baby kailan in garlic. It was really something for everyone in the family who had their personal likings. The food worked out well with the taste buds and palates! Need to also add that the taste was good and being allergic to MSG, it was quite "safe" with no side effects. I think the food is good and can make it!The place is quite spacious and the staff are very friendly. While waiting for my order, many customers streamed in and I can see they are mostly regulars. Parking is convenient within the industrial estate. Open and uncovered though. I asked the staff if they operate during lunch time and they said yes. Will find another time visit this eating place again for either lunch or dinner
