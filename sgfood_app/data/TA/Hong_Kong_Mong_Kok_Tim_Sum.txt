not anymore so cheap as compared to Bangkok. Yet, commodities sold here are still cheaper than the ones sold in the shops

Stall don't open daily. Think they are closed on Wed but better call them if you don't want to be disappointed. Get a number from the box placed right below the number sign board and wait for your number to be called (just like you are seeing a doctor). Regardless whether you want to eat it there or takeaway, you still have to take the queue number. Love their char siew bao, 3 buns for $ 2.40 and freshly made, steamed and juicy. Their bun is like what you get in HK, fluffy with split opening at the top of bun, not like to factory made type. Be prepared to wait for 15 ~ 45 mins depending on the time you go

Do not mistaken this stall with another Dim Sum stall located just few units away on the same row. The other one is called Hong Kong Dim Sum, which sells 14 types of dim sum compared to just 6 types for this stall.We have tried both stalls. This one is good but choices are very limited , while the other one has extra 8 items choices for those who wants more varieties. But it's not as good, though it is not bad.This place is always crowded whenever we are here. To attest to their popularity, one needs to take a queue number & the LED signboard above will show your number when due.There is only 1 price : $2.30 each for all the items. Tim sums are generally not cheap as usually they all are served in small portions.Compared to say noodles, which one gets better value for the same price. But note its a tedious task preparing Tim Sum. Over here, one gets to savour very good Tim Sum at much cheaper prices than restaurants. Definitely a good deal if you are here for good food & don't mind eating in simple, non-restaurant settings.They are ready usually about 11am, which already has many waiting. So come early to avoid much longer wait
