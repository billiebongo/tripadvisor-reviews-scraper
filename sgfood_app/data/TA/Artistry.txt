The restaurant located at a central location that is perfect for friends meet up. But I was a bit disappointed with the food this time, I ordered carbonara and it was very watery :( Coffee was good enough to gain some points back.
5
Well made food.
The coffee was fantastic! From an ex barrista i can say it was faultless.
The blueberry and ricotta hotcake was perfect. Soft and fluffy in the centre and crusty on the edges like a cookie.
10 out of 10

Food quality is good and food items are interesting. Great coffee. Attentive and friendly service. Unfortunately, it's a small place so not really conducive if you have a big group.
3
Place is very cozy, there are lots of interesting magazines which you can read while waiting for food. The price is quite high for taste of food.
4
The breakfast portion is just righteous & delicious in all aspect. Ambience is casual & Cosy except the chairs are not comfortable.
5
The stuffed French toast (peanut butter and raspberry jam) with vanilla ice cream and a coffee called “flat white” is the way to start any morning! The cafe is small and cozy with outside tables for those hearty souls who have already been sweating from a group bicycle ride. Menu is limited but everything looked good. For those of you who like healthy food, there is a plate for you. Please sit at another table
5
I’m writing this review while still sitting before the table. I am immersed by how good the food are. I don’t remember the name of one plate of some sort of pancake on my table, nor the brunch set on the table across for my sister. But they both taste heavenly! A hat-off salute for the chef! Oh and the ambience is like: I’m not budging an inch my *ss off of this chair.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.But first, let me finish my cake
5
We were not disappointed with this place. Menu was great and had so much variety for vegetarians. I had the halloumi and eggs, outstanding! Still thinking of it and it's dinner time! Coffee was the amazing! It could rival some of the best coffee stores on Melbourne and they know coffee! We will definitely be back!!

Came here for a late brunch on a Saturday morning - able to find a seat easily outside. Ordered the below items:- Chai Latte $5.00- Hot Chocolate $7.00- Big Breakfast $22.00- Blueberry Hotcakes $15.00The chai latte was alright; though it was strange they did not serve their drinks with at least a teaspoon.Big breakfast was fine as well - the hashed brown (potato balls) were crispy and just right.The hotcakes were awesome - definitely a lot better than most other places serving hotcakes. Crispy on the outside; soft on the inside!All in all, the bill came to $49 for a 2-pax brunch. However, I have to admit the place is not really child-friendly; it's catered more for the young teenage crowd. Servers were attentive and friendly
5
I looked online for a good breakfast and found this place. I’ve choose “Big Breakfast” and I’m not really a big eater. But Oh My God! It was the best breakfast I’ve ever had. Everything was so tasty and i couldn’t stop eating it all! What a wonderfull place. The staff is very quick and lovely. THEY HAD ALSO GREAT MUSIC ON!❤
4
Super good food and its just next to the hotel nuve which i was staying. the staffs are friendly and serve good coffee as well. can get crowded during lunch time.
5
It's a nice place to chill ..
I tried the chili crab burger and I liked it very much.I The coffee served was amazing too.
4
Nice cool setting and decor with inside and outside seating. Excellent chai and carrot cake and the food they were serving to others was very appealing.
Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.

Busy place on Saturday afternoon. I like the berries hotcake. The hotcake is hot and fluffy and very tasty. The cappuccino is mild, strong taste coffee lover might not like it that much. Overall, nice atmosphere and good music.
4
Service was attentive and the server who greeted us at the cafe entrance was friendly. We had to occupy a table outside as it was full. Nevertheless we indicated our keen interest in a table inside the cafe when one frees up. Unfortunately the coffee machine was down but we were pre-warned as we were handed the menu. We ordered the Big Breakfast and Eggs on Toast. An indoor table freed up and we were gestured inside. The service and good food made up for the non-caffeine morning which is usually a no-no for both my husband and I.We both need our caffeine fix. Having said that and despite the fact that we were sipping tea, both our meals were delicious and satisfying. We plan to return for another meal. As my hubby was settling the bill, the coffee machine roared alive.....well, the next visit I guess
4
Came by for brunch on a wet Sunday morning.. as usual, the place was packed... er... with the younger crowd.Nonetheless, service was attentive and accommodating. The food was YUMMY.Only blemish to the experi3nce was... the coffee machine broke down.. so no latte for me this morning, but I did enjoyed my Earl Grey.This place is worth a revisit
5
I love this place....when I travel I am always visiting an art center, a museum, a MacDonald's as my benchmarks...this is one art center that I keep coming back to...almost daily. Aside from the awesome artistic vibe which would not be out of place in my home town of NYC or beloved Berlin, but the staff is fantastic. They do great food for anything from coffee and tasty cakes to full meal...their veggie burger and fries are to die for as well as their high stacked American style sandwiches...in the evening grab a drink and admire the art, watch a poetry slam or an impromptu jazz performance. his is a place of many faces, each one fun, lively and...artistic. Come hang out with the locals and tourists alike and soak up the vibe
5
The ambience is chill and cosy. The staff are pleasant and take initiative to open doors for the customers. The food is deceptively delicious. There are good lacto-ovo vegetarian options. One of the most pleasant cafe experiences Ive had in a while. Highly recommend to drop in
3
The food looked good. But after waiting for 20mins we gave up. There were several empty tables, but these weren't cleared after the previous patrons. Place is severely understaffed, the 2-3 staff walking around the tables without a clue where to start. A shame cos as I said the food looked good
5
Most Singapore cafe don't open until at least 11am at the weekends!! Here they open at 9am. The food is very good and reasonable price - loved the new Ondeh Ondeh hotcake. Pandan hotcake topped with pandan coconut gelato, coconut ricotta cream and drizzled with gula melaka. Other breakfast meals excellent too!
5
It was my first time at Artistry and I'm loving it. I like the art exhibition by various artists. The eggplant burger is really delicious and we can choose either fries or salad as side. There is outdoor seats n indoor seats.
5
Artistry is a great place for grabbing a Coffee and just sit outside and have a chat. The staff treated us nice and the Coffee was well done, the surrounding area is also very nice! Would come back.
5
Artistry is conveniently locating in Arab street, where there is not only cultural places to visit, but great indie places to shop at Haji Lane.
The breakfast items here are amazing. The big breakfast set and BRB pancakes are MUST TRIES!
4
Really near to arab street (Bugis area), so extremely central. Super chilled out so great for brunch
5
The location is good near arab street. The crab sandwich with chilli sauce on the side is delicious. On saturday, there was a great brazilian drummers performance
4
Delicious coffee and relaxed atmosphere make this place a great stop to rest while rushing around the city.
5
Been hanging out at this spot for years and i absolutely love the duck pasta and the big breakfast set! It's got a great ambience and the ever-changing gallery interior always beholds amazing local art pieces that are intriguing and inspiring! Best place to go for a coffee mid-day while exploring Arab street and haji lane
4
Artistry cafe comes recommended from the reliable folks at Lonely Planet and I have to agree and similarly recommend. Located near Bugis, this is a modern coffee shop serving some great cups of java. I had one of the best flat whites I've ever had in Asia at Artistry. My wife and I also took advantage of our early arrival and had breakfast here. She had the acai bowl which was incredibly unique and consisted of yogurt, fresh fruits, toasted sunflower seeds and coconut shavings. My wife loved it. I had two eggs over easy wirh multigrain toast and with wonderful sautÃ©ed spinach and portobello mushrooms on the side. The only downside: the air conditioning was either not working or the temperature was set too high. It was way too warm inside the restaurant but maybe that is how the ensure the tables turn over :
2
Food was good but staff manning the counter was less than friendly, although the waiters n waitresses were great. First, when I went to the counter to get some sugar for my coffee instead of offering any assistance, she gave me a dirty look. Then when paying, they swiped the credit card incorrectly for LESS than the actual bill amount and we pointed out the error. Again the counter staff, who then came back with the correct charge slip and the cancelled one was curt and had no word of apology for the error made nor appreciation that we highlighted the error to them. What would have been a great experience was marred by such a snob of a staff
4
I read about this cafe as a great place for brunch on Urban List - just don't try to come here before 9am! It has a chilled out modern hipster/artsy vibe (in the perfect part of town for it!) Staff are friendly enough. I had the big breakfast, which was really tasty except for the bread (which really didn't taste like anything!) The tea was too weak however. Good wifi - just ask for the password. Prices are high...if you're from Perth it's pretty normal, but for everyone else, it's probably a bit steep.
3
The food and the atmosphere is quite good. The wait staff have terrible attitudes,Which makes me more than motivated not to go back.
So many great places to eat in Singapore, don't have to go to places where the waiters how cocky attitudes.
5
Melbourne standard coffee ( and if you don't know what that is then you have missed out on good coffee). Delicious breakfast and the staff are as good as you are going to find, simply friendly and courteous!
5
Unique taste for their coffee beans, consistent standards, great service. Pricing of food is on the high side, coffee is standard.
3
Read rave reviews about their crab burger and peanut butter and jelly French toast. We felt 'jelat' (satiated and a bit sick) half way through both items. Really not that fantastic after all. The sauce and the patty of the crab burger are not that nice. Recommend to share cos u will get sick of the food pretty fast. We went on a Sun afternoon and the music plus the crowd and the cramp space made us in no mood to talk. It was so noisy. We heaved a huge sigh of relief the moment we stepped out of the place.
3
My friend and I were super disappointed today after receiving our acai bowls. We love trying acai bowls everywhere we go and these were the smallest and most expensive! It tasted good, could have been more frozen but we overall wished the bowl was more filled for the price. We also ordered a panini which was delicious but also not big, and nothing comes on the side for the price either.
5
This is a very nice place. I love the atmosphere and concept. I had a chilli crab burger and it was a delight. I would recommend this to anyone. The choice in iced thees and a real espresso put a smile on my face. Good way to start your day
5
Our hotel was just literally 2-3 minutes away and I'm glad it was so near. Their food is good. We tried their selection of pasta and it was tasty, the flavors are full. The serving is just enough for you to be full. Another good thing about the restaurants is, they support the arts, you can see paintings on their wall, at some days there's a band that's playing, their interior is cozy and shabby chic, they reuse old wood. Very nice. Visit Artistry, it's a good choice.
4
Our daughters were visiting us in Singapore and one of them discovered this quaint place downtown, tucked away a couple of blocks from busy Bugis Junction. It's a small cafe with a couple of outdoor tables and a handful indoors, with art works displayed on the walls. When we visited, there was an exhibit by a debuting feminist painter on "The Topless Liberation Front." Interesting, but the real headline was about the food.We ordered the Beef Shakshouka, a Beef Panini, Big Breakfast and a Chilli Crab Burger. Everyone loved their food, with the Panini being the best with everything else a close second.We combined these with very good coffees (piccolo latte, cappuccino, flat white) and a really excellent chai latte.Service was friendly and efficient. The ambience is casual and quaint. Great brunch experience
4
Tuck away in a nice corner of a row of pre-world war 2 shophouses. It provides amble place for both in/outdoor dinning experience. The old building gives it a rustic feel that adds on to the whole dinning experience.I came here with 2 boys below 5 and my wife for lunch. The boys and their mum had pasta. It was tasty! I shared a plate of the squid ink pasta pasta with wifey and it was nice (a bit too oily). My boys had the duck confit pasta; equally good but just too oily too.I had the Angus burger. Three juicy little burger couldn't fill me but it was yummylicious. Good eat. It was topped up with an awesome tasting pancake dessert. Yummy and cook well to have the pancake crispy bite on the outside and maintaining the moist on the inside. Nice...only thing odd (to me) is the piece of bacon that comes with it. I chow it down anyway.
4
We found this place randomly and lucky for us they had a Reggae night on. Happy hour offered good tasty wine and beer. So we were very happy! The crowed is nice and friendly. Everything was great:)The food menu doesn't offer finger food choices which is a shame. We tried their Angus beef burger which was tasty but the portion size for 20 SGD was a joke. Just 3 tiny burgers and a little bit of fries. It was more like a starter rather than the main.
5
Great coffee, a really excellent panini, relaxed atmosphere, stable and fast WIFI. Service is not super professional, but friendly and fast. One of these nice "nerd coffee places" that luckily you can meanwhile find in nearly each bigger city...
5
Fantastic spot, friendly service delicious food and incredible coffee! Will be back again tomorrow!!
5
We are here twice in our week stay and each time it was perfect.
The coffee is the best I've had in Singapore and the big breakfast is huge and delicious. The wilted spinach toss with garlic is amazing!
5
We tend to come to Singapore for a yearly visit and this is always our place to stop for good coffee and breakfast. Great atmosphere & friendly staff.
4
i enjoyed the mix of irregularities in various forms all gelled into 1 environment. overall more hits than misses. loved the peanutbutterjelly french toast the MOST. the combo with the icecream is paradise! :D
3
We were looking for a cafe-lunch spot near our hotel, and Artistry was right around the corner. I'd read a little about it, so thought we'd check it out. Though it's a rather small space, it was nice and bright, and we liked the artwork on the walls. I came with a friend who is pescetarian, and we were glad that there were enough items for her to choose from - we ended up sharing the chilli crab burger and the eggplant parmesan burger, and I also had a soy Piccolo latte (another plus point being that they do have soy options, at an additional charge). Food wasn't fast, though I didn't think it was abnormally slow and we were happy to wait and chat anyway. We both enjoyed the burgers (my friend found the chilli crab sauce had a bit of an overpowering flavour, but I actually liked it so....more for me!), and my coffee was good. A point for improvement would be that the eggplant burger was a little greasier than I thought it should have been, but not to the point where I would have complained about it. We also thought the crockery was really nice! Recommended if you happen to be in the area and feel like some decent cafe food, with good coffee
2
The food is ok in here, well the cake and coffee was. However the staff are miserable and when you ask for the toilet or wifi code they just grunt at you. The staff are more interested in sitting outside with their friends than the customers. shame
5
After being disappointed with my hotels breakfast, I immediately began searching for alternatives for the next few days I was in Singapore. Artistry is one of two I found that were excellent. If you've been hanging out for a great coffee in Singapore then this is your place. The food is also great. I tried the ricotta pancakes which was served with ice-cream, fresh fruit and bacon. It was simply divine and well worth the 20 minute wait (as advertised on the menu). The cafe isn't too large, but there are table outside if it's busy inside. There are a couple of communal tables too, so don't be afraid to bunker up with strangers. Artwork adorns the walls and are for sale but prices are quite expensive $1600 and up! Overall a great place to get a coffee and a lovely breakfast

I generally dont gove 1 star reviews unless there has been something which can possibly ruin your trip and in my opinion is unpardonable.My wife and I visited Artistry cafe on 2-Oct. We are vegetarians and ordered a pomodoro pasta which was quite awesome. The place has very limited options for vegeterians. We asked for has browns and the server told us that the hash browns were agd 4 are smaller in quantity and french fries are more value for money. We ordered french fries and when the bill came we saw they charged us sgd 10! I was surprised as the server had r3commended us french fries instead of hash browns..it could be a dollar more but how can he provide me an option in lieu of hash brown which is 2.5x more expensive than the hash browns. Anyways the waiter apologised but didnt reduce a dollar from the bill inspite of the miscommunication. This was not it! When the bill came it was sgd 38. I handed my credit card and when I recieved a copy I was in for a shock. The cc was swiped for sgd 380 instead of sgd 38! I was quite surprised at the mistake and went to tge the counter. The lady at the counter who had done the mistake was totally unapologetic and just mechanically took my card back and swiped it for sgd 38 now givng me a reciept for for the void transaction. No apology at all! Swiping a credit card for 10X the amount is No small mistake and deserves a sorry at leaat.Artistry is a tourist place and I would urge everyone visiting this place to a) upfront ask and double check charges for all the items they order b ) double check their bill for anyform of over charging. I am been staying in Singapore for 1.5 years now and I have never seen such ridiculous customer service before! Expecting a response from the management on what are they doing about this
4
This place on the corner of Victoria St and Jalan Pinang near the Arab St precinct is a gem. The coffee is excellent. There is always art on display although the artists ask for a fair bit. Prices not set by the cafe owners.Their signature chilli crab burger has a lot of punch. Big juicy pieces of crab meat ball, and generous serving chilli crab sauce. It is $25 and totally worth it.Cakes are delicious too, at a modest $6-7.Don't be shy to share tables as the cafe is always popular.If you can find parking on adjacent streets, parking on Victoria St is allowed on Sunday and public holidays for single yellow line areas only, and Golden Landmark mall nearby
5
We were desperate for a great coffee and Artistry certainly delivered. The food also looked amazing but we had already eaten for the day. Would highly recommend a visit!
4
We ate a really good burger and an excellent salad there. The cakes are delicious also.
Nice atmosphere in this place.
1
Another one in a million coffee / brunch place. Horrible cake called Virgin mango coconut which taste exactly like those cheap mango juice box. Too bad they don't have decency to use fresh fruits or even fruit purée.
4
We went to Artistry Cafe for a weekday lunch and found it packed! The all day breakfast was good but the star of the show was the chilli crab burger - must try!
4
If you want to feel right at home, this is the place to go. The staff here are definitely a warm friendly bunch that makes you feel welcomed into their "home" the moment you set foot in. With the eclectic mish mash of mismatch furnitures, it feels like I stepped into a neighbour's home as they pull out the extra chairs to fit everyone in.Must try their BRB pancake - blueberry ricotta bacon pancake. It's a twenty minutes wait but oh so worth the wait. (note that it's only available in the weekdays) Come on down for an interesting brunch experience.
4
Cool little spot on the corner with a nice outdoor seating area (wasnt happy with the guy next to us smoking). We had coffees which were very good and the pbj French that's which was very good too. What I don't understand is with the French toast is the long wait, probably around 30 minutes. Especially when there were not many others dining.Would like to try some more items from the menu if we get a chance to return
5
I needed somewhere to work while I had a few hours spare. I like somewhere open, reasonably quiet with good wifi. Artistry on Victoria street provided everything you need. The coffee (I had several flat whites) is great, the wifi booms in and the people are pleasant and articulate. They speak a variety of languages (in a city with four official lingos including English). They are practical and helpful - which is not always the case in Singapore!The building is set back a little from Victoria Street behind a couple of large trees. There are rustic-style wooden tables and stools on the street frontage and chairs tables and the odd lounge inside. The decor is minimalist post-modern in black and white (well very dark grey and cream!) and (but?) has a great ambience.I mucked around with some work, had some breakfast (not a great range but pretty good - perhaps a little pricey), moved tables, had a Skype meeting, lost some stuff only to have staff locate it and generally made a nuisance of myself. The staff continued to treat me as a friend of the family!Did I mention that the coffee was good
3
I have heard so much about Artistry and finally, we are here. The disappointing start is the menu. Other than the big breakfast and eggs, I think it is quite limited. Cafe is really small and for that kind of place, good is overpriced . Big breakfast is $22 while French Toast is $14. The bread is hard and from observation, those that ordered did not finish or did not touch the bread. French Toast is great tough for desert. I frequent Olio Dome, probably the best value hang out with great ambience. For that kind of price, I would gladly go back to Dome where the big breakfast is about $14. The bread is so much nicer and with great jam! I probably won't go back to Artistry. Rather , I am trying a new breakfast place next week
4
Little cafe is halfway between the hotel and office. Wish it would open just a little earlier. Eggs over easy on toast with a tall black best way to start the day.Service has always been great but wish the coffee cup was just a little bigger.Word to the tall people, if you come off the sidewalk through the little tube steel arch, duck. It's not made for anyone over 
4
Popped by here while waiting for my blood test results on a Friday morning. Probably 2 other covers beside me. The service was fast and prompt. Ordered the big breakfast and enjoyed it thoroughly.second time here and not my last! keep up the good work guy
4
Coffee and food were both very tasty, its just a shame that the price is very high for the tiny portion of food which they serve.
5
Grab a drink and/or dessert and enjoy this cool spot! Outdoor and indoor space with indoor space filled with artwork.
Plus some good deals during Happy Hour!
1
The worst timing from the kitchen! Waited for almost an hour for our breakfast! We were not even informed by the waiters/waitresses about the long wait...utterly disappointing!
2
The cappuccino is normal. the coffee was not strong enough. The atmosphere is nice (paintings and music).
After the coffee time i have visited the Arab quarter.
4
We had our after dinner coffee here. The menu is simple. The place is really youthful.
They have outside seating and interior design is really hip.
Coffee is really good.
Will definitely try the rest of the menu.
5
So myself and partner and brother decided we would go to this cafe as its just up the road from our hotel, we were not disappointed! The service from all the staff was brilliant and they all had a friendly approach. Our drinks came straight away, and the food took ten minutes or so but we were sat outside taking in the surroundings and enjoying the beautiful Sun. Once the food came it was fantastic, hot and so yummy! If we had more time in Singapore we would of certainly gone back! We ate the big breakfast each and everyone ate it all! Yummy
5
Here it is guys. The best Cafe in SingFlat white was the best we have ever had outside Oz;Crab Burger was the best we have ever had;French Toast was the best we have ever had;Service was great, efficient and well meaning;Great crowd all soaking in the atmosphere indoors and out.Correctly priced.Need I say more? Pictures attached. Great job guys will recommend to friends and family. The end
4
Service was good. Staff very attentive to your needs. They have a nice variety of food and drinks on their menu which makes it a nice cozy chill out place with friends after work or weekends. They have a nice variety of cakes too which are totally yummy. My favourite is the choc peanut butter cake! The combination of both was heavenly. Definitely won't be a waste of your calories
5
Artistry - Part art gallery-part café and also pet friendly. The food is good and staff are friendly to my pet as well. They even serve water to him without requesting for it. Pet is only allowed at Artistry’s outdoor seating area. Tried their big breakfast and PB&J french toast. I will go back for more. Location- Artistry, 17 Jalan Pinang Singapore 199149, p. 6298 2420. Open Tue-Fri 9am-11pm, Sat 9.30am-11.30pm, Sun 9.30am-4pm
5
We were over the average hotel breakfast so searched the Internet for good Cafes close by, I'm glad we found Artistry. The coffee was fantastic. The eggs with hash bites and kale chips was really nice and the berry and ricotta pancake with bacon and ice cream was one of the best dishes I've ever had. They even had some NZ beer and cider, cider seemed hard to find in Singapore, I wish we had found this place before our last day
5
Very nice service! Great food and and an incredible atmosphere provided with the art&music and decor! In the heart of the arabian neighbourhood... Very close to the Bugis Station! They arr also opened during the night, with live music and a great vibe!
5
We visited several times on our recent trip to Singapore. Coffee, wine, great food, free wifi, very nice staff, great air con inside, nice outside area which you could smoke in, loved it - great vibe.
4
Thinking of afternoon coffee in the Kampong Glam area? Try crab burger with chilli crab sauce and peanut butter&jam French toast. The coffee is awesome whether you like it black or latte. Laid back ambience with friendly staff. Does not hurt the wallet!
4
Finally found a coffee in Singapore. Good coffee and good food. Great venue with inspiring art. Well priced and good service.
Will be back for lunch.
5
Food was amazing- presented really well, coffee was outstanding! Extremely friendly and helpful staff would definitely recommend visiting when in Singapore!
4
Chanced upon this place through reviews in trip advisor. Good recommendation. Place has limited seating capacity but crew is friendly and food quality is good though not a large variety. It has a simple deco but is full of life with a bustling crowd. Will definitely swing by again
4
The food comes very quickly. Price was reasonable except the chilli crab burger that is a little high. The three of us ordered three different things and to rank them I would put the pasta with duck confit and butter sauce last and big breakfast set as the first. The burger sits in between. The restaurant is small and food is served very hot (some places we go - eggs would be luke warm when the dish arrived our table)The restaurant offers free photo printing too. We will come back but maybe we will try different things on menu next tim
5
We stumbled upon this place on our way to Arab street and were so glad we gave it a shot. Even though there were lots of different options at lunch time (like all day breakfast) we both chose the vegetarian pasta. The desserts were so tempting, we couldn't pass them up. I had a slice of the zucchini cake and my mother in law had tiramisu. Everything was great! Friendly service as well
4
We arrived past 12 noon and we hardly got a seat. We were given the menu but I was told that there were only a couple of things available, the Portobello Mushroom Burger & Potato hash with scrambled egg, charred kale and bacon. I was truly disappointed as I already had the duck confit pesto linguine, pb & j toast & big breakfast on my list, but then we were there, famished & no time to look for another place. So, we had cafe mocha, flat white & the Portobello Mushroom Burger & Potato hash with scrambled egg, charred kale and bacon. Orders came in after a long wait- the place was packed so yeah, it was understandable. But I was very surprised when 2 other tables got served Belgian waffles! I would have ordered it for my daughter who loves them. I asked why I was told there were only 2 things on the menu available and turns out, the guy made a mistake. Too bad it was too late to order for my daughter who eats for hours. The guy was very apologetic though :)I am glad we decided to stay and give the place a chance coz the food was so good! Both orders were gone in minutes and we loved the coffee too :) It was raining hard when we were about to leave so I asked the same guy who took our order where we could run and buy an umbrella, but he gave us one instead. He said it was his way to apologise for the waffles we werenâ€™t able to order. It was very much appreciated as we were heading to a wedding at Sentosa. This place is definitely going back to my next-SG-trip list. Maybe dinner would good so we can catch their poetry reading session.P.S. In case the guy who gave me the umbrella reads this: I meant to return it the next day, unfortunately we left it at Tanjong Beach Club after the wedding. Sorry and thank you again :
3
We came after having read raving reviews about this place and although we enjoyed the food quality we were disappointed with the small portion sizes for the price. We had the eggs and toast, PB&J French toast sticks and the lobster pasta for $49 Singapore dollars (approximately $40 US). My boyfriend left the restaurant hungry. The lobster pasta was very good - good quantity of lobster included yet it was bathed in garlic. Do be aware the restaurant closes at 3pm (at least on the Saturday we were there) and on the weekends they don't serve their roast turkey sandwich and a few other items.
5
Came here for breaky, food was fabulous (especially the baked eggs!!), service was extremely friendly and coffee was AMAZING. I literally skulled my coffee.
A must visit.
5
Artistry is one of the few places that I keep going back to : for poetry readings, intimate music performances, exhibitions by local and regional artists, there's always something on every week. Absolutely the place for a chat and few doodles.
5
Pasta was spicy and good.
Iced white kopi was also good but more on the bitter side. Just ask for extra sugar if you want it sweet.
4
The food here is excellent with variety of menu to choose from, mostly western dishes. Good cocktail but a little pricy than beer. Get crowded at evening. A trendy place with live music.
4
Came here for a coffee after lunch at a nearby restaurant today. The place was pretty busy at about 2pm, but still some seating available inside. My cappuccino was very good, with a pretty little design and at just the right temperature. Good ambience inside: I'm tempted to come back and try the food some time
4
First of all, I like the decorations in this place. We ordered flat white for 2. The coffees served proper and taste good as it should be. Apparently, kitchen close already when we arrived. No chance to try their food yet. (on Sunday kitchen close at 4 p.m.
4
Latte and flat white were good! The food was great! Ordered hash potatoes with scrambled eggs and kale and peanut butter raspberry jelly french toast. Highly recommended! Will definitely return to try other food selections :-)Location is accessible as it's walking distance from bugis mrt station. Friendly service staff and orders were served promptly. Cafe can fill up quickly as seats are quite limited indoor and no prior reservations accepted. Do be there early especially on weekends :-
4
Was there on a Sunday afternoon to chill and read a book. Plenty of space with inside seats and a tall ceiling and outside benches short and tall. The outside seats are subject to haze and noise. The friendly service, was a bit laid back but that was the mood on a lazy Sunday afternoon. They served very good coffee, had a reasonable menu, with relaxing background music, magazines and art to admire. I will be back. Did I mention the NY Style Cheesecake, solid base great texture... :-

This place is not suit to big group during peak hour and also hazy problem. Big group have to sit outside (no matter how the weather is bad)For food, they serve their own specialty dish. Nice flavor. Good thing they wont charge 10% of service. the price is worthy reasonable

Was out exploring in this area and stopped in mostly to have some coffee and a snack. Was told that the kitchen was closing in 15min which was fine because we didn't want to eat anyway. What horrible service, we just sat for like 10 min while it looked like the staff didnt want us to order because the kitchen was closing. I already said didn't want anything from the kitchen.Anyway had to go up to the counter to order and pay but I see later that the other customers did not have to follow this procedure. Has to ask for sugar, for napkins for some paper towels and extra fork for the desert we got, just crazy. Finished the cake and coffee and couldn't wait to get out. Good coffee though

Great coffe, pretty expensive though but worth it...the airconditioning will freeze your as* :) pretty easy to find...

As Singapore is usually a white spot on the global coffee map, my expectations for decent coffee and breakkie in this city are very low. But his place has exceeded all of them easily. Brilliant ambience, delicious coffee and great breakfast options. A highlight!
5
Great coffee in a country that it is very hard to fInd this! Paired with yummy cake. Wish we had found it earlier in our stay! Great find!
5
For coffee lovers, this is the place to go. They make very good coffee, have a really nice range of cakes and send out a nice chilled out vibe.

Nice and casual. Young staff, cool place. Relaxed, good tips given, comfort food. I do recommend as a first stop out of the plane. only open at night and can have a fair bit of queue/wait
5
Great place, great coffee, great food!
I looooove this place...
when i came there, there's a gig, an awesome one. will surely come back soon..

This is a nice unexpected find in Singapore. We were walking past looking for a place that serves brunch and found this place. This is the only café we have found that serves ‘flat white’ coffees. The prices were reasonable and the breakfast was exquisitely served on handmade plates that were made from local artists and available for sale.Delicious breakfast place
5
Stopped for coffee, ended up trying cocktails. Espresso Martini and Rum special amazing - great flavour and great value - good quantity of alcohol too...Nice place to chill, really good inside - cool art and relaxed.Wish we could return, but out of time. Best cocktails we have had in our visit to Singapore. And area nearby does not look the best, worth persevering to find
5
We came here few time with friends and we never feel disappointed on each visit.The staff is always very friendly, the cake especially the carrot cake is very good and their coffee is also fantastic.The location of the café is also very strategic which is not very far from Bugis MRT station (apps 10mts walk), there's a few backpackers hostel around and Haji Lane, Sultan Mosque and Arab Street are just around the corner.Highly recommended for the best coffee and carrot cake
1
Arrived at 1PM and they were already sold out of all breakfast/brunch items, and nearly sold out of lunch items except burgers. A real disappointment when you make a special trip to enjoy a top rated restaurant on TripAdvisor.
5
Did not try food other than chicken popcorn which are the only bite to go with a beer. Amzing organic stuff (everything) and very coop design and interior. One of my favorite bars
3
Met up with friends for brunch in this highly-acclaimed cafe. Ordered the highly-recommended crab burger, but was not wowed by it. However, the Gibraltar coffee was a great delight. It's quite a rare item on the coffee menu in Singapore. It's a must-try!
5
During my recent trip to Singapore, I visited Artistry 3 times. It's a cozy place with unique food options and good service! My only disappointment is that I haven't tried their Nasi Lemak burger yet - definitely next time!
5
How refreshing to find a cool cafe with upbeat music, friendly staff, tasty and pretty food, smooth coffee and very tempting rustic cakes. I love it ! Why did I not come here sooner.
5
Must try their house burger, Artistry Crab Burger, which made by crab petites. Latte very nice. Is very art cafe that along Victoria street.
5
One of my favourite places in Singapore. Cool location. Very friendly staff. And the food and coffee is consistently excellent. Highly recommended!
4
We were here early for Sunday brunch/lunch, so did not experience any crowd issues. I had eggs on toast, which was not too expensive, and came with mushrooms and spinach in garlic. Portions were hearty. They also served us water without asking (a rarity in Singapore), so bonus points there! Walls are lined with art works by local artists, lending a nice arty, bohemian feel
2
I can see that many ppl come to get chill in this place and give pretty good review. I am sorry to say that I cant agree to others...The staff are nice and I had quite enjoyed the vibe until my tea and cake were served. The ginger lemon grass tea was too weak,, barely tasted the lemon grass.. :'( and it didn't have right feeling of freshness. The cake... I didnt even finish half of it.Well this is my personal experience, so don't judge too early based on my review. U might find it different to me. Maybe I would come back to try out their breakfast menu as this place seems to be more famous for that.
3
They served pretty standard brunch menu and I tried their french toast. Tasted good to me but for the amount that I paid, I felt that is quite expensive. Coffee doesn't leave much impression for me but it should be average. The only special in this cafe is you can see a lot of painting decorated and they are on sale. If you like to enjoy arts + having something to fill the stomach, this cafe is a good choice
3
It's pretty expensive in my opinion as they're serving pretty standard brunch or breakfast, i.e. bacon, sausages, toasted bread and side salads. The coffee was nothing to shout about too. And worst, the place is a bit too small and they're stingy on the air-condition. It's steamy hot inside the cafe and we just kept sweating. We switched to another cafe pretty soon after we're done with food. Not coming back anymore

Husband brought me on a Saturday brunch at Artistry. It was a first time for both of us. We decided to check out the place based on a Yahoo article which my husband read. We had no expectations (no expectations, no regrets!).The cafe is right at the corner of Jalan Pinang facing Victoria St. It can easily be spotted by the color of its facade. You may opt to dine al fresco or inside the shop. We preferred staying inside to have our brunch.Based on what we both have ordered, I can say that their food were delicious and they have, if not huge, a very sufficient serving. The concept of the shop is unique on its own and has a very laidback ambience. You wouldn't be scared to approach any of their staff as everyone were all pleasant and all smiles.Will definitely go back to try their pancake with bacon on top which unfortunately they do not serve on weekends :(All in all, it was a very filling brunch for hubby and I. :

Good and vibrant restaurant , photographic art exhibits, live music in the evening.. The food is of very high quality , and very good value for money. You can also get rid of your bit coins there...if you don't know what to do with this brilliant investment idea..they accept bit coins . Swap bit coins for their French Toasts with coconut ice cream..you won't regret it 
4
place to go if you are nearby bugis/arab street area. for myself who drive, its not easy to find a parking in around there, so in term of accessibility, its not so easy. i like the outdoor space and how the cafe is located on the corner, however as singapore can be super hot during daytime, i still prefer strong aircon for me to chill on my saturday with my cuppa and some food. do try red velvet cake if you like something sweet
5
 My wife and I recently visited Singapore and while there we set out to find the best coffee in the city. We decided we most like Artistry!Artistry is definitely a place to make sure you visit for breakfast while you are in Singapore! Their coffee is definatley top of the line, and the food was great. I had a mocha and the pancakes, and would suggest trying both. A bit on the pricey end, but all details are closely tended to including lemon ice water, nice flower center pieces on the tables, and perfectly crisp pancakes, only to name a few. Try it for sure
5
Came for brunch and was delighted. Made plans immediately to go back again. The crab burger and Swiss beer is a giant combination. French toast rocks too. Coffee is special. The decor is artsy as is the staff. Cool music. Shhhh.... my only fear is this place gets ruined by successâ€”but I'll keep going back as long as they keep it tight :-
5
Choose Artistry based on recommendation & not disappointed. Long shared table screamed this will be different, & friendly helpful staff explained the creative menu. Started with perfect short macc's. Food wise, GF went muesli with fruit & yogurt which was brilliant, fresh & full of flavor. I went the crab burger on black ink bun which was fresh, light & fantastic too ... Truffle fries a great bonus. I'll be back & soon
5
Located in a beautiful building at the edge of Kampong Glam this was a real find. Art gallery, coffee shop, chill out place... Really very relaxed. After too many bad espresso's elsewhere, we hit the jackpot here. Not just with the coffee, also with the owner who turns out to be a great guy
5
I was impressed by their hot chocolate as it was not sweet or sickeningly sweet as I've seen in both Australia and Singapore.The cafe is also a gallery so there is plenty to check out.Their spinach salad was amazing too.Great atmosphere and lots of space to work outside or inside
5
A nice cafe situated along Victoria Street. Nice, cool environment. The friendly owner, Prashant, was very attentive to his customers. The cashier and staff were helpful and friendly too.I tried the Red Velvet cake, their signature cake, which is really nice. Try it if they have any available when you are there.
4
When I went out to find this place, I almost walked right passed it. I saw a nice old building with 'Chemistry' on it and went it to check it out and found this resturant. It was a hip little place not really suitable for a family with little kids (thankfully I did takeaway). The food we got was great although there was some food already sold out. I would certainly go back.
4
Nice little trendy cafe with great atmosphere. We came for breakfast one morning and it was quite tasty (Blueberry and bacon pancakes, yum!). Nice coffee as well and great music. The staff are very friendly also. Well worth a stop in for a coffee and a treat or a brunch if you're in the are
5
Artistry doesn't only have the best coffee I've had in Singapore, but also great food and cakes (the salad is delicious and the brownie to die for!). Really friendly, and cool atmosphere and true to its name, has a lovely photo exhibit on the walls! Looking forward to coming back here for brunch
5
Had an excellent lunch here today. My wife had the Artistry salad with duck confit and I had the grilled cheese and pulled pork panini. Servings were cafe sized but perfect for lunch. Staff was friendly and decor inviting. Hope to return for coffee before leaving Singapore
4
My spouse and I just visited Artistry for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. She had the eggs Benedict, while I had the PB&J french toast. Both items were delicious, and we really liked the atmosphere and low-key service, which reminded us a lot of some places we frequent in the States. Be advised, however, this place is a bit spendy; we loved what we ordered, but the price was a bit too much and would be a bit prohibitive for future visits. You'll enjoy it, but your wallet won't
5
Well this is one cafe where I can safely say, the baristas are very friendly and pleasant to converse with during your visit. The place has a very warm and rugged but artsy feel to it. The Belgian waffles were pretty good and the coffee was nice. The menu is limited but as long as the food is great, who cares really.
4
Always love coming back to this place! Music's good, coffee's good, cakes are great. There are numerous events held in the evenings, showcasing local artists / anything really. I remember trying a drink called "Smokey Havana" during one of their events and it really did taste like cigars!It is located at a beautiful standalone structure, with wooden flooring, and has a indoor and (partially) outdoor area. A great place to catch up with friends, or just to have coffee
5
Artistry is the perfect hangout if you appreciate good coffee, food and art. They have one of the best coffee is SG (nice character to the beans without diluting its boldness); the best red velvet in town (seriously, a must to try); and crab cakes that could redefine your concept of brunch (no eggs!). But what separates Artistry are their well curated art pieces and performances (true to their name). Spread over the whole month, these events add more flavor to your coffee or meals. Events range from poetry gigs, live jazz performances, open mic singing fest and a geek science fair. Artistry is a one a kind space for good food, coffee and liberating artistic expression. A must to visit when in SG
5
Great little place. Awesome coffe and food. Really friendly and free wifi. Good place to have (all day) breakfast and work out what you want to do for the day. The guys are really knowledgeable on the area and good for some local tips and advice
5
This is a great place for a coffee and light snack and the have some amazing photos on the wall taken by local photographers. Great location and fairly fast wi-fi, nice friendly staff too. The paint rubbed tables give it the old world look, reminds me of a coffee house I used to drink at in the UK
