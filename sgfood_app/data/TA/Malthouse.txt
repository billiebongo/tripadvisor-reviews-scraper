We enjoyed the nice terrace, great service and good vibes. Great selection of beers; we loved the white beers. Burger was pretty good but fish and chips and hot dogs were below average. I would recommend going there for beers at night.

About a dozen good craft beers on tap. Small but well prepared menu. Friendly staff, if sometimes a bit distracted. 4 beers, garlic bread and a pasta were S$80.
Unfortunately outside tables are unusable due to crowds of noxious smokers, but inside is nice.

Visited twice in October/November and on both occasions were were served great food and drinks by very friendly and welcoming staff.
Great selection of beers and food in a superb atmosphere. Reasonable prices too.
Well worth a visit.

Love this bar. It seems to be getting better and better. Range of beer is great, food while limited in range - what they do - do, they do it extremely well. (Chicken wings are amazing). Very much worth checking out.

Decent beer selection and menu makes for a nice, casual night out. Mix of Westerners and locals here on most nights. Burger in particular is a good option. Patio is particularly great (though smokers can sometimes ruin the vibe).

A MUST go if you are into various types of beer. The selection is vast and prices reasonable. Outdoor sitting is also available. Bar food is available and not to bad tasting too.

Just in my neighborhood... oh the salmon is ok too .. but get the burger !!! For 16 bucks add the bacon for additional 2 dollars

It's a good place to chill out with friends. They have comfy sofas and the ambience of the place is superb. They have a variety of choices for ciders which I so love. The food is good as well. A bit disappointed because they don't have the garlic mushrooms anymore. Staff are super nice. So love the place

Looking for somewhere to eat with my kids (4 and 3) in East Coast when heard about the Malthouse brunch. Usual selection of brunch fare, but interestingly all the food on the kids menu was not only free, but prepared fresh. This was evident when the cheese and tomato pizza that my kids ordered had handmade crispy base. Makes a change from the usual world of processed food for kids at pubs/cafes in Singapore.I ordered Eggs benedict which was great, and ended up staying longer than expected, mainly owing to the giant table sized kids colouring sheet. So top marks for thinking of kids and parents at the weekend. Highly recommended if you are in the neighbourhood or after a cycle along East Coast

Siglap has been lacking a decent pub for the past 5 years that I have lived here. The food and beer offers at places such as the Sidewalk Tavern and Picotin are really poor. So far I have tried the excellent Hitalchino IPA, bacon in a glass (sublime and a good portion) & friendly staff. Pricing for beer is pretty standard c$14 a pint but some are discounted and there are deals on food + beer.The atmosphere and they play a wide range of good music. The decor is nice with bare brick walls and Chesterfield sofas. We are heading back to try the brunch menu today. Kids eat for free.I think that this place gives venues in town a real run for their money and its on my doorstep. With other high quality venues such as Plank Piizza opening up in Siglap it is going to either force the general standard of Western food up or send the incumbents out of business.Please support them!
