I went to the one at Tampines Mall and other than the salted bean bun and red bean bun is nice. Their staff is really polite too! Really made my evening!

This little kiosk sells our favorite deep fried "you tiao", salted buns, butterfly buns, and sesame balls - something we could grab for a quick breakfast and it is so near the MRT station. They also serve porridge and "tao suan".
