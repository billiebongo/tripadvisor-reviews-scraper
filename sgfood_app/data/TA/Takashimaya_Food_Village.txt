Went here for lunch on monday. Oh goshhhhh soooooo crowded..... We waited for sometime to get an empty table.
I ate oyster omelette for 6,5dollars. Very delicious.
At first i want to eat pepper lunch but the queue was so long i decided not to.
4
It is great place to fill your stomach after a busy "shopping day". Wide range of options and it is bargain. I suggest also to check the market of Takashimaya, as sushi is great there.
3
Grabbed brunch at 11am before the crowds swarm in. Lots of options depending on your fancy. Not gourmet, it's just a food court, so no expectations for quality, ambience nor service
4
Being in this place, feels like being in Japan. They have excellent varieties of food and desserts, bakeries, stores around etc. It is always extremely crowded.
5
This is the international food restaurants. Sell many foods from Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan, and from Singapore, too. Recommended and located at Orchard.

Without a doubt the best yong tau foo stand in Singapore. The broth is just perfect, nice and subtle and then with all the vegetables, noodles and additional options to put into the mix it’s outstanding. I love coming to this stand. The two main gentlemen who do the cooking are always friendly, have nice big smiles and always willing to chat when they see you more than once and recognise you as a regular. Food and service
2
Been here several times. This year quality has dropped big time. The chicken rice was decent but the Bak kuh te stand had the worst stuff I’ve tried. Stinky pork and bad broth. Don’t know how they would sell this as a premium dish. Seriously it was so bad even the cleaning auntie found it foul smelling. Oh well.
1
I ordered the chicken biryani and it was not chicken biryani. I got some rice and a bowl of chicken and gravy, which is not chicken biryani. I should have known that 8 SGD was too good to be true but this was truly the worst Indian food I've ever eaten
2
We went shopping at Takashimaya and decided to have lunch at the food court as my wife wanted to try out the Indonesian food.There were about 15 stalls at Food Village but unfortunately there were only 2 stalls that were halal, the Indonesian and Indian stall. The food served at the Indonesian and Indian stalls were average and nothing to shout about. The biggest let down for Food Village Takashimaya is the seating. For a large store, the seating for Food Village Takashimaya was deplorable. The place is constantly packed and there were lots of people continuously waiting for a table. I suggest stay away from Food Village Takashimaya if you are in a rush for a meal and come in a big group. It’s not familyfriendly, especially if you have kids. You will likely have to wait a long time to find a seat and will be separated as the seats are limited. I don’t intend to return unless I am alone and really have to.

It's located in basement area of Takashimaya dept store. First time come, i can see a lot of people had a lunch in Sunday. Even to searching for a free seat and table seems difficult. For the price it's quietly expensive compare to the outside or street food. But with the condition of AC room and lot of option it's worthed to had a lunch here. I saw some automatic yakitori machine. Really amazing with that. Recommended for the cutlet specialist
4
Reason for 4 star? Too crowded and difficult to find seating
Many choices, but please be selective. Some stall can be pricey and portion wise not worth it
5
Must be here before or after lunch break as super crowded. Take time to check out all the food counter. Served very nice and delicious food.
4
In this level B2 they have Amazing Choices of Food , Dessert and Fruits from different country chocolates like royces and wonderful fruits from Japan or you can have honey from new Zealand (Manukau )
With plenty of resturant
You will enjoy your time here
4
The only draw back is the lunch crowd that can get too much for a tourist. They offer plenty of options from Chinese to Indian to Malay to Japanese to Korean food. The portion is reasonable and the cost is even more reasonable. It's a great place to enjoy the local crowd and to see how locals do their lunch.

Ngee Ann City is one of the most popular malls in Singapore because of the variety of shops here, starting with the best department store in town (Takashimaya) to the best bookstore (Kinokinuya), and encompassing all the big names in retailing. Surprisingly, the food court is among the least good at this end of Orchard Road: less variety, below-average quality, and most importantly, fewer tables and seats compared to the number of stalls! Wisma Atria next door (Food Republic at Japan Food Town on Level 4, Picinic on Level 3), ION Orchard (Food Opera), and even Isetan (Food Republic) offer more choices and seats
1
Have patronised this stall on several occasions. Met dishonest stall handlers at each turna. Gave the wrong change. b. Over charge on fish component on 1 meat two veggie combo by 2 sgdc. yesterday, overcharged again on meat option by 1 sgdAmazingly feedback to Takashimaya management have fallen on deaf ears
4
No need to venture far from the fabulous shopping opportunities at Takashimaya once you get hungry. Just go down to the sub basement level and be bewildered by the array of food shops from which to choose. The place that we visited didn't take credit cards. Don't know if that's the case for all
5
Hawker center could be translated into food court or food truck rodeo. Located on the lowest level of Takashimaya department store. Each vendor had a different culinary option. Appeared to be very popular with the locals. Even if you choose not to eat it gives an outstanding exposure of the many types of food available in Singapore. Recommend. Hope this helps.
5
I absolutely love this food court. It has an amazing selection of food, dessert, bakery and fruit to indulge in. The only issue is finding a place to enjoy it all as it is always super busy during lunch and dinner hours. I especially like the durian ice cream and cake store
5
Similar to the Tokyo one, this is just blow my mind away, some old classics met with Singaporean twists and the result is exciting and eye opened experience. We went there twice and both we could not find any seats so ended up bought some snacks to have before dinner and some takeaways sushi to have at the hotel room. I could easily spendnhours just wondering up and down this place. The Chinese noodles fish balls looked absolutely yummy. There are far too many choices to choose, bring your appetite
4
This is busy. people everywhere with baby strollers without, rushing and mainly EATING. There are umpteen food stalls and you choose your meal(s) from different cuisines, local specialties....some superb, others moderate but all BUSY....
3
Built more than 20 yrs ago together with ngee ann city mall, this is 1 of the oldest massive food courts in town. Has everything local and beyond, but of course the quality is suspect. Ok for a quick no fuss bite
3
I've been here endlessly throughout my 12 years of living here. It's kind of just your standard hawker, only made 'fancy' for tourists. Nevertheless, the food is good and there is a lot of variety to choose from.
5
This is my favorite place to eat in Singapore. So much variety and very reasonable prices. Can be a bit crowded in lunch hour.
4
This food village has an amazing choice of foods from Chicken rice to Indian food exactly opp to the same counter.Cheap food and not expensive and usually always full. It took us a while to actually get a table.This place is amazing as we can get choice of various cuisines all under one roof. If you visit this mall make it a point to visit this food village
4
Really crowded on lunch and dinner. It is hard to find empty tables. The food selection is great. And the taste is good. As this is located in one of the most famous shopping center in Singapore many tourists will eat here for lunch or dinner after shop. Price is still reasonable, not too expensive considering the location and taste
5
This is one food court that will suit almost every palate.. A huge range of cuisines like japanese, thai, indian, korean, etc. and ample seating space although it may take a few minutes to get place during the rush hours. there is a great dessert counter as well and i loved the shaved ice dessert
4
Met my husband for dinner after work at Taka. We decided to try this ramen place, Baikohken. We ordered Soyu Ramen (1 Regular and 1 Half) plus eggs! Portion was just right for both of us! Softness of the char siew was okay. Can try if you happen to be around this area.
5
If you a Japan Food Lover, this place could answer all your needs! From Fruits to A5 Wagyu, Sushi to Baumkuchen Cake, they got all it here. Air-flown Japanese fruit, Wagyu Don with affordable price, Fresh grilled Yakitori ,and heart-warming-stomache-filling Tonkatsu Ramen, who is not fall for this place? the place is very clean, the staff are hygiene too and easy access to get there. Located at Takashimaya Shopping Center.
3
Set out like a posh version of a hawker center and serving pretty good food, this is a place that would provide a really good introduction for those new to Singapore and its cusine with an easy to enjoy taste of the food and concept of the Hawker center.While I dont believe there is anything stunning food wise here, its a good starter for those not sure about branching out to more local places.
2
You can find a great choice in there. Generally we did not find Singaporean food tasty. Typically it was edible but not more than that. This was only place where food was so unpleasant. We just left food on the table.
4
Great place to get a variety of food. It's where East Meets West. He gets really crowded, but there is plenty of places to sit.
5
A great alternative for a delicious lunch in one of the nicest shopping center in Orchard Street. Choices of Indonesian, Japanese, Singaporean, Indian, Cantonese and other wonderful cuisine, hawker center style. Next to the food court is Takashimaya grocery which specialises in Japanese and Asian.
4
Taka Food village has a huge selection of great vendors and is typically more economical than the neighbor's food court...
I particularly enjoy the Yong Tau Foo stall, which is friendly, courteous and doesn't try to cheat me because I'm Ang Moh.
3
There's a decent selection of various food available in the basement of Takashimaya. Not particularly cheap, but probably better quality than can be obtained at the more standard chain food outlets. Can get very busy so it's important to be patient!
4
Takashimaya is an upscale Japanese department store on Orchard Road in Singapore. In the basement, they have their food hall, which is comprised of many stalls selling different cuisine from around Asia. So it's not McDonald's and the like. You can get some pretty good food here at prices that reflect the real estate in which it is located. Still, not bad value.I had the Singapore go-to meal of Chicken Rice. It was not the best I had in Singapore, but it was good. They offered several kinds of chicken, and I chose one with a soy glaze. Served with white rice, some stewed vegetables and a small bowl of broth, this chicken rice had a more bland flavor than I expected. Still, the location was great and it was a good respite from the shopping
2
A small ramen place at the Takashimaya basement. The shoyu ramen came with (I think is two) thick slices of char siew and few bamboo shoots. Unfortunately, the char siew that I had was quite dry. The noodles were thin and chewy. The lava egg though soft and running, it was rather bland
3
Orchard road malls present loads of options for the food gourmet expert such as the Isetan food court, Ion Food Opera , Tangs Food court , Food Republic, Atria and also Takashimaya food village. At a first glance they may look the same but there are some different bits in each food court. Some of the interesting bits at Takashimaya are the desserts counter, and esepecially the Japanese made desserts (Mr. Obanyaki and Taiyaki )and snacks. My personal favourites are; fish ball soup, and the Thai counter. Other Singapore street food which can be found are; Yong Tau Foo, Padang food, Chicken Rice and Sichuan cuisine. The supermarket and also stalls on the same floor selling packed manufactured items make the experience an adventurous one. The place is always full and noisy and you would need to work hard to find seats. I hope the management can work on the air conditioning
4
So many choices, more than just a food court to me. Coming from Australia, the variety here was mind-blowing. I had delicious meals at very good prices. My party had Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and we all shared and enjoyed our meals. It's very crowded, but if you keep your eye out, there's a table being cleared somewhere. I was here 2 years ago, and it's still busy as ever, which to me says that it is worth it. I really like this option for value for money and authentic food from the various Indo-Asian regions.
4
Not sure why some reviewers call this place "nothing special". I beg to differ. The tens of offerings are almost universally beautifully presented and the quality is high. We went for an afternoon and tried three different delights - noodles, rice with chestnuts and beans, and Indian. All were delightful, well spiced and teased the senses. Not the cheapest, but well worth it. I wish I was in Singapore longer in order to sample a greater variety
3
This place is always crowded (I personally think the sitting area is too small). Serve various kind of food
5
Loved it. Brilliant place to eat, food is cheap, plentiful and you can taste the whole world down there. The roast duck is to die for. Clean and not too difficult to get a seat.
5
Fun place to go for food choices. Make sure not going to have meals there during lunch and dinner time. Go and visit before lunch or before dinner time to be able to get the seats peacefully...
3
This food court is slightly more expensive than the typical food court you will find across Singapore's malls. The food here is not much better though, although the sheer variety of food available here is a good enough reason to have a quick lunch before heading out for more shopping. Try the chicken rice located by the entrance and the mixed vegetable rice a few stalls down
4
The place itself have nothing special, just like common foodcourt in shopping mall, but we found this place called Yonehachi accidentally, they have various rice in their japanese food, it's very delicious!!They put Chestnut and nuts in their rice, honestly for me, they are the stars :) I think their salmon is one of their best menus, eventhough the salmon is so-so, their rice is their truly star!! Must-try, must-visit place in Singapore. The price not quite cheap, but not sky-high expensive too. It was around S$ 8-15
3
Air conditioned comfort - Not the cheapest food court in Singapore but there's a variety you can choose from ranging from Asian delights : Chicken rice, YONG tau fu, curry , Korean , Japanese , Indian, Vegetarian etc . I do recommend buying food from the other food vendors just outside of the food court - do order coffee and tea from Ya Kun coffee which is just a very short walk out of the food court to enjoy your fix of Kaya toast and even buy a bottle as a gift ! Great curry puffs - very flaky and great for a light snack from A1 curry puffs . There's also hot steamy paus, chicken skewers , lots of bakeries selling excellent baked goods, salad stop for a healthier choice meal and lots of other delights all at basement 2 of Takashimaya. There's also a huge Cold Storage Supermarket located just next to the food village . Really Convenient 
3
The concept of air-conditioned food court in humid & hot Singapore to attract shoppers to stay underground and never have to resurface onto the streets is brilliant! Takashimaya around the world are famous for the little offer of tasting and testing of food products, just join in to tease your taste buds!You can fulfill most of your gastronomic desires in one place - a good selection of Japanese, European, Korean, Chinese, Nonya, Indian, and Malay (Halal) stalls to highlight and experience the cosmopolitan city that is the attraction of Singapore.Drop your expectation of "fine dining" and specialty food. Be prepared to queue and carry your food while looking for a table or seat.Go with the adventurous spirit of trying anything once and enjoy the noisy busy bustle with tourists and also many happy younger generatio
5
One of the "medium sized" food courts, but for sure the brightest and "upscale" in terms of food vendors (read: not just local fare but Western food choices as well). Typical Singapore food court prices (read: $5.00 USD gets you a generous and tasty breakfast, lunch or dinner). You can eat there every day for a month and not repeat a meal. Yummy ! and NOT THAT crowded compared to other large food courts during the peak hours.
3
We had lunch here one day for a change and while my lunch was great, my hubby's lunch was a disappointment. The food was cold and a very stingy amount as well. However, the place is well patronised and don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. Judging the number of locals eating there, it is a very popular spot and well worth visiting
5
I have been eating in this food court since I was a little girl. This is one of my family's favourite haunt. The place is not only very clean, all the kiosks are different, affordable and are srlling yummy food. What I like to do, is eat here every single day and get food from a different kiosk everytime. It is also perfectly located if you are having to visit Mt. E a lot during your stay. This is the case with me. My parents are both patients of the hospital and we go there quite often. It is not possible to go anywhere too far. Although Paragon and and Lucky Plaza are right across or next door (respectively) the food in those places are mediocre and nothing compared to Takashimaya's. And the best part is, after you are done eating, you can finish your shopping for the day or you can get food from the cold storage, grab a taxi from the 2nd floor and then be home or hospital bound.
4
Really superb food court ... sets the standard for mall food courts really high!!
So much nice, well prepared Asian street food in a nice indoor air conditioned setting!
5
We always come here usually when we visit Singapore. The food court is clean and has great selection of food from different countries. Location is on basement of Takashimaya. Most food from food vendors are quite good.
5
If you are busy shopping and don't want to stop, then this is the place for you! Lots and lots of vendors serve every type of Chinese, Singaporean and other Asian foods. It's always super busy at lunch time!!
3
I ordered Bariyani Rice with Lamb and Chicken Curry which all turned out just good by food court standard. All Tastety and Authentic Indian.
Portion was so big which I couldn't finish all of it.
Price was fair.
4
I simply love the range of food available here. Some of my favorites can be found here. Bengawan Solo, Bee Cheng Hiang, bakeries, snacks and I do love the Popiah and steamed yam cake.
4
Had curry Yong Tau Foo with noodle for $5.60 at Takashimaya Basement Food Court.
The curry is quiet tasty though the items are a bit small.
It would be better if they also have a stall that sell coffee at reasonable price.
4
We had dinner at the Food Village at the Takashimaya basement on Orchard Road.I tried the fish soup at Suan Thai, the lady was kind enough to accomodate my request. I ordered seafood soup but asked all the seafood items to be removed expect the white fish. Service was fast and the bowl just cost Sing $5.00. My family members had Indian food rok the Indian Stall and they liked their dosa, and biryani very much. The Food Village is just a great place but like all Sing food courts, finding a seat is tricky business. Enjoy.
3
The food here is not bad but the premise is not very big. And it is quite warm here. Especially if you take hot soupy food/drinks. It can get sweaty & uncomfortable.Happened to speak to one of the cleaners who cleared our table, who agreed this place is very warm. They have feedback to the management many times but nothing has been done. She actually requested me, as a customer to make the feedback hoping this will get something done.There are many other nicer, bigger & much newer/cooler food courts in the nearby Orchard Road malls . All within walking distances ie at Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, 313 Orchard & the newest; at Shaw Centre. The range & food in these places are just as good or even better than here. Worth the short walk going to these much cooler & bigger alternative food courts. We were at Ngee Ann City for an appointment & were running short of time. So dropped by here for a quick lunch as no time to go elsewhere 
5
If you are visiting the Takashimaya complex then don’t go without savouring a myriad of options at Singapore’s local hot spot. Cuisine from around the region, your dollar will go far with a main meal and a sweet dessert for around $10 Singaporean. Great shopping centre as well adjacent that offers great quality produce and alcohol of all varieties at acceptable prices. Takashimaya complex is a hidden gem within the crown that is Orchard Road
4
You can find many cuisine from Asian to Western here. Yong Tau Fu, Hainan Chicken Rice, Nasi Padang, Japanese cuisine, Thailand cuisine, Korean cuisine, Bak-Kut-Teh and Pepper Lunch. This place is always in a crowded situation, you must find your table before you order the food.
4
Going into SG, we know Takashimaya food court will be a "hang out" place for us and it didn't disappoint.
4
I guess nobody left this place without finding something to like. Food, pastries, bakeries, just name it. And when it comes to -food- prices it's quite pleasant too, highly recommended.
4
Very busy in the peak hour but everybody enjoy it. Plenty of choice for you and your family. We love it.
4
Yonehachi is a casual Japanese dining place that specialises in Okawa Rice (steamed glutinous rice served with meats, seafood and vegetables). There are many sets to suit one's taste.
Both the scallop and chestnut rice were good. I like their stewed vegetables too.
4
Coca restaurant managed to produce (twice on the same day) one of the best Tomyum seafood soup I ever had. Staff are very friendly. Highly recommended.
5
happy eating meals are celebrated here everyday with various choice of food and vendors. I prefer rices of Yonehachi the most.
3
Takashimaya Food Village is clean, the building management is quite selective in choosing their tenants. Many of the food taste ok, not necessarily nice. But people has no others choice since the place is very convenience. Price wise is reasonable compared to others restaurant inside Nge Ann City, but relatively expensive compared to others hawker centre. Very crowded and lack of seat, people are gazing to find seat and it is quite irritating
4
Amazing selection of food and snacks. Really love the selection of Japanese food. Prices are great and selection is mind numbing. My only complaint is there is nowhere near enough seats during lunch. My advice: get to lunch around 11am, dinner 5pm or choose from the restaurants that have reserved seating near the back towards the Harrods store.Try the Otowa restaurant. Great food
4
You can tell that this place is very popular among locals, tourists and expats judging by how difficult it is to find a table during peak hours. This food court has great choices and is in a very good location.The concept is thematic - if you're craving for a particular international favorite, chances are you'll find an outlet here. They have Singaporean, Malaysian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, western - but sadly I didn't see a Filipino-themed outlet.This is a self-serve place and it's up to you to find a vacant table. There are 'aunties' that clean the table but it's okay to bring your tray and used dishes to the Tray Return Station after you eat to help clean up the place.The prices are within the average rates for food courts in Singapore and the serving sizes are meant for solo consumption per order. Service of the outlets is fast so it means, if you're really hungry, you won't have to wait long for your food.Tips: If you want to save a bit, you can stop by any convenience store and buy your drink there and bring it to the food court. Must try would be the traditional Singaporean desserts in the corner area near the exit. If you want to eat really healthy, there's a salad outlet that offers fresh fruits and veggies and healthy dressings. After eating, check out the hall a few steps away - Takashimaya often has great deals and bargains there

This place is just one of the many food courts which you can find in Orchard Road malls.Its not a big place; so avoid lunch or dinner time as difficult to get seats & long queues for food.The range is quite good though; with a good mix of Local, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian & other cuisines.Some of the cuisines that we have tried are not bad. But generally they are all about the same everywhere.One thing to note. The place is pretty warm. Taking any hot soupy food can further make one feel hot & sweaty.If you happen to be at Ngee Ann City mall, come here for a decent priced meal. Otherwise nothing special to come all the way here if other food courts are available near where you are in Orchard Road
1
Never visit this stall. Cheats money. Never informed customer price of vegetables mushroom is consider meat price. Anyhow charges. Never will i or friends will visit this stall. Food taste terrible. Staff from china looks grumpy.
3
Crowded and so busy and noisy you would think they were giving away the food. Not so two small ice creams cosy more than £8 which were nicely flavoured. Glad I didnt eat there having seen the prices. Small snacks cost over £15 each.
4
The Takashimaya Food Village offers a wide choice of cuisine for the visitors to choose from. From Native Singaporean food to Malay, Vietnamese, Japanese etc... Try to go a bit early or a bit late as it gets crowded during meal time. Food reasonably price. Place is clean and cool which counts a lot in hot and humid Singapore
5
This food court is worth visiting if you get a chance. The only downside is the LONG wait for a table, but it is worth it because the prices are low and the food is excellent. We have been here twice on this trip to Singapore and both times it was pretty packed, although during the week it seems less busy. Sunday night was a real challenge finding a seat for 2 people. The Biryani Butter Chicken was very tasty and I recommend it. There are plenty of choices here like any good Hawker Centre in Singapore
4
Its at the basement of takashimaya shopping centre in ngee ann city, right in the midst of downtown orchard road.Its a mixed of takeaway easteries and food court stalls.Overall the quality of food is good and if you like the novelty japanese finger foods, this is the place to go.However the food court is rather small and therr is never any seats to sit and have a enjoyable and comfortable meal. Nevetheless, a good place to go and takeaway some japanese finger food
4
I really like Takashimaya's department stores and visit them in every city I find them. Their food courts are astonishing. So many choices and all of them look delicious. I tried the fried carrot cake and though I'm sure it was delicious, it was a flavor profile that did not appeal to me. I'm glad I tried it because new foods are the best part of traveling, but not all "hit the spot" on a Western palette
2
Visited here with the twins I chose the Indian food butter chicken and biryani rice. One chose pepper lunch salmon also good then the other bought ban mee with fried fish. The auntie was not nice and the food lousy according to her. Recommend do not buying from this stall. Paul's Restaurant Rating based on the Ban MeeRating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant.

I ordered Pad Thai and Som Tum for lunch today. Its awful. The noodles were old, precooked, and broken into little bits. NO pad thai should look like this. The ingredients were not fresh if you can find them. They use little electric stove so wont work with Pad Thai.Som Tum was tastless. Stay away.
4
We stopped our window shopping for a snack, and were lucky to grab a seat as a couple was just leaving. There is a vast range of local and Japanese foods and snacks here. We had the grilled pork snacks and a cold drink. Although we had wanted to stop many other times there was just no opportunity for a table. Very popular for a reason
1
Went to this food hall because of many previous visits , usually had Thai and sometimes Indian food. Sadly I can no longer recommend to friends , I had the pad Thai at the stall offering Thai food . The food used to be cooked fresh by the ladies when the stall was in the centre and it was delicious not anymore , awful , noodles sans flavour , so sa
