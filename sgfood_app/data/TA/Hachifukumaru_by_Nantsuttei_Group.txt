Was hoping for a good Ramen here. But overall the flavors were basic and the overall Ramen was nothing to write home about. The other dishes were also average. Heard they are closing from this location.

Popped in here for lunch today and had the set lunch consisting of a bowl of ramen and a small bowl of rice with chopped char siew. Both were very tasty. Service was efficient and friendly. This one is worth another visit.

Delicious ramen with good flavours. Wednesday is ladies night - free glass of prosecco for ladies! Mine was only half full though, but better than nothing.

Tried the Ramen with the much talked about chillie oil. Just didn't do it for me. I felt the noodles were just not fresh enough for me and the broth was ok but not perfect. The meat was good though. The other dishes were not extra ordinary eithe

I believe it's been more than a year or two since we last visited this ramen place. They have a rather unassuming shop front but serve one of the best ramen here in Singapore.Very thick and tasty broth and I love the texture of their ramen too! But I find the cha shu a bit too hard. But honestly, the cha shu that I had in Hokkaido were hard too. Maybe that's their way of cooking:

Ordered a bowl of pork based soup and also a bowl of chicken based soup ramen. Preferred the pork soup. Chicken soup wasn't rich enough. The one item I enjoyed was mentaiko egg. Soft and creamy with generous mentaiko inside.Service staff are great and prompt. Location a little hidden behind OG. You can walk into OG and all the way to the back towards cuppage

My husband lived in Japan for 6 years, and I lived there for one. We had our favourite ramen place that sold kazan ramen in Mito City, Ibaraki. Since moving to Singapore, we've been searching for ramen that's comparable to that. My younger sister introduced us to Nantsuttei, and we've been going back regularly ever since! It's the closest we've found to our favourite ramen in Mito City. We love the spicy shiro ramen with black oil! Ramen comes with many different soups and toppings, so Nantsuttei isn't the favourite of all our friends, but for my husband and I, it's the best we can find in Singapore! It's flavourful, yummy with spicy! Mmmm! Oishii katta desu! We've brought many friends here

Visited this restaurant for lunch, overall experience is pretty good. The ramen choices here are not too unique, but the set up-size is only 1 dollar, which grants you a side dish and free flow of iced tea. The soup-base used for the ramen here is quite different (In a good way) from all the other ramen shops I have tried in Singapore, and the noodles have a nice texture to them. Service was pretty average, the waiter seemed a bit dull, but the person who greeted us from the kitchen was pretty energetic
