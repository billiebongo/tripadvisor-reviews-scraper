Delicious chili crab! The lobster was top notch!!! What an experience! Mouth watering ü¶Äü¶ê
If you like to taste Singapore‚Äôs signature dish, do not miss it

We went to this place on a recommendation and found it to be just perfect. The chilli crab was delicious. The seating was not overcrowded and the service was fst and friendly. Highly recommended, but you need to book well ahead.
5
Found this place, didn't have a reservation - but they found a space for me anyway. They looked after me very well, and I tasted the chilli crab, I hear the pepper crab is also very delicious too! The rest of the menu looked delicious too, would have loved to be here with a group to try more things - but I'd definitely recommend making a booking

No idea how this place managed to get these good reviews. Other than the fried mantou, the dishes i ordered were all disappointing: ‚Ä¢ Grilled squid tasted dry and rubbery, had a hard time chewing it. SGD$20 for a small portion of grilled squid, totally RIPPED OFF. If the Grilled Squid is delicious, it would have justify the overprice cost but nope! Bad taste. ‚Ä¢ Vegetable (Sambal Kang kong, $13) tasted extremely awful. It was tasteless without any sambal fragrance in it. I believe we can get better sambal kangkong at any hawker centre.‚Ä¢ Chillies crab was average. I have to dip the mantou into the sauce to score flavour of the dish. Nothing fantastic. Overall, it costs me $100+ in exchange for a bad dinning experience. My first here and the LAST. Overpriced and it is definitely a Tourist trap!!!!

This place is a tourist trap. DO NOT COME HERE. Decided to try out as I will be in the vicinity of Chinatown. However, to my horror, as a local Singaporean, I would say that I've never tasted seafood that bad till this day. Guys, do not be fooled by the good reviews because they are all from tourists who do not know the real goodness of chilli crabs. Seriously...just visit a simple coffee shop or hawker center that serve crabs and the experience will be ten times better than this. Any housewife in Singapore that knows how to cook can do better than here. The sambal kang kong (vege) served is old, tasted bitter and simply has no sambal taste at all. My mum can do better. The $20 bucks grilled squid was really a joke and it is probably only worth $2 bucks. Not to mention, dry and tasteless. The dressing (sambal) served together with the squid are worse than the ones I bought at local supermarkets. Most importantly, the chilli crabs just made me want to get my meal done and over with asap. Overall, we paid 100+ for this load of "CRAP" we thought would be crabs. Just visit Melben guys. Don't waste your time booking or coming here.

Emphasize on the word "experience." It does not offer the best taste, but the de-shelling service is what gives customers the good experience, and makes the restaurant suitable for all occasions, from family gathering to business meal.I ordered crab bee hoon specifically to compare with Mellben Seafood at Ang Mo Kio, and although Momma Kong's achieved very similar quality, but Mellben's soup has a richer taste that lasts after the meal.Momma Kong's crabs are of smaller, standard size and the price of menu is fixed, unlike Mellben that allows customers to choose and pay extra for giant-size crabs. However, Momma Kong's has made very good use of the materials it is given and enhanced on "experience.

Momma Kong's used to be great for their crabs - NO more. The quality has slided gradually over the years. Tonight (10 Feb) my partner and I vowed never ever to return. The steamed crabs were so dry, came to us luke-warm. The crab roe of steamed crabs are usually tender and soft. But theirs was solid hard. We suspect the crabs were boiled not steamed. Our evening was really spoilt by lousy quality dinner

We just arrived in singapore and roamed the streets of chinatown and decided to eat some Singaporean chilli crabs. We stopped by momma kongs and it was surprisingly super delicious. The food was great, the service was great and the ambiance was cosy and inviting.. 5 stars bab

We go on late dinner, the place is full but there is one table that sign reserved, and they give that for us, so we didn't wait long to eat.. If you come on time for dinner I think it will have a long queue so, prepare yoursel

Got here for dinner and we had a very good meal. We ordered the fixed-price $50 Chilli Crab dish and several other items including the crab fried rice, noodle soup, and grill squid. Everything tasted really good, as expected. The restaurant was nice and clean; the service was prompt, and the atmosphere was cheerful. They even took a picture of us and gave us the picture when we left. That was a good way to have the famous Singapore Chilli Crab, knowing the price and not market price as most other restaurant advertised
5
Best place staff and food are fantastic
Chilli crab was a huge standout
Highly recommend
We had the the meal for 2 it was just perfect goes down very well with a tiger and a glass of Chardonnay
5
Super fast service, excellent food, decent prices. The chili crab was heavenly, the butter crayfish excellent, and the only down side was them running out of the double chocolate gelato. Skip the more famous places, this is a wonderful restaurant for your time and money!

I went with my husband and sister to a 5pm sitting at Momma Kong's. We had the famous crab, chilli and pepper, and they were delicious, but.......they are messy to eat so I expected we would be given a bib and a finger bowl. No, you are given a couple of small serviettes. The wait staff were aloof, definitely not attentive during the meal and not openly helpful....we needed to ask about the menu and recommendations. We drank beer and this was a ridiculous price. We ate at a few hawkers markets and enjoyed the food there and the experience more than the exhorbitant price we paid, essentially for the meal because there was no other part of the experience at this restaurant we enjoyed
5
I went for dinner at Momma Kong‚Äôs with two business partners and we all greatly enjoyed the chilli and black pepper crab along with the kang kong with garlic! The bbq stingray was also very good and tender...not fishy at all.The ambiance and vibe were good and clean. The servers took great care and attentive the whole time. This place was the best when compared to both Jumbo‚Äôs Seafood and Palm Beach which I have been before
3
This is our first time to visit Momma Kong and find it meets our expectation. We order the butter crab and the black pepper chilli crab, which is OK and we satisfied. The place is quite small but clean and helpful staff. We chose to seat outside to feel the surrounding ambience where there are many food places in the street. Nice area to spend the evening with friends and family
3
My husband devoured the crab which was top notch . Garlic Prawns were ok- too much garlic... reckon they should add some soy and lime . Kids and I went for fried chicken rice and buns . Chicken was mainly batter and goopy . The deserts were superb .
5
This is such a great place. My first of 3 chili crabs this trip. The place is small about 6 tables very clean and the staff is so friendly. They even take your pic. It‚Äôs reasonably priced. A large crab beer water and rice was $45. I‚Äôd recommend splitting two crabs with someone the chili and pepper crabs. Be prepared to spend time getting your hands messy and staying a while. After walk two blocks to go shopping at all the market stands by the temple.

Felt compelled to leave a review after dining here as I couldn't bear to see fellow foodlovers' crab experience marred by this fake (I came after reading awesome reviews too). Seriously, you can get better crab at practically any random place you pick. No hard feelings against the owners here, purely objectively talking food hereThe crab beehoon broth had a very mild hint of crab flavour, could have passed off as any regular fishbone soup with evaporated milk. Crab was not fresh, clearly the frozen sort (mushy meat, shell and meat difficult to separate). White pepper crab was covered in an awkward white pepper goo and wasn't fresh either. Butter crayfish lacked buttery fragrance. Stingray was dry and rubbery and overdone, so bad that I went against my Asian principle of not wasting food. Can't understand how anyone can get a simple garlic vegetable so wrong either, tasteless and dry and overcooked. Total damage: sgd 230, and very very unsatisfiedThe most exhausting and worst crab experience I've had as a Singaporean. Please try others
5
Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior and location, this is one of Singapore's best chili crab meals! We searched the city for a shark fin free menu that served the city's local delicacy and we are thrilled it lead to Momma Kong's. Great service, amazing food and the best chili crab. Get the mantou to dip in that delicious sauce. Don't go to the big chain restaurants to try chili crab....this is your spot!

My daughter and I were eager to try chilli crab so I booked a table at Momma Kong's after reading positive reviews here on Tripadvisor.I booked a table for 5.15 p.m. on a Thursday night after reading on their Facebook page that a 20% discount will be applied if a table is booked through Quandoo for between 5.00 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. on a weekday.We arrived just after 5.00 p.m. and were quickly shown to our table. There were only two other tables occupied inside. As we were hungry and wished to try several dishes, we ordered the set menu for 2 people at S$132++. I decided to pay an extra S$15 to have the crab de-shelled.Our food arrived quickly. We had: Chilli crab, butter crayfish, garlic greens (forget the name of them), grilled squid, 4 steamed buns, two barley water drinks and two gelatos.Personally, I found the chilli crab to be too spicy, but that's because, I believe, I'm not used to spicy food. I wasn't keen, also, on the barley water. The rest, however, was great.My absolute favourite was the butter crayfish. I couldn't get enough of the magnificent butter sauce and soaked up every morsel of it with the buns. The squid was also very tasty and tender.All the serves were generous and I was, at the beginning, doubtful if we'd get through it all, however it was so good, we just had to keep on eating.Now to the disappointing part. When I called for the bill, I noticed that the 20% discount hadn't been applied. I questioned this with the waiter, and he said that it only applied to a la carte, and not the set meal. I pointed out that I thought that no-where on their advertisement did it make this distinction. He shrugged his shoulders and I paid the full price of around S$178. In retrospect, I should have asked to speak to the manager, but I wasn't 100% sure of my facts.When we got back to the hotel I checked the terms and conditions in the ad and there was nothing which said that the discount only applied to a la carte meals. I emailed the restaurant and received a reply immediately from the owner who apologized profusely for the error. Apparently there was a computer glitch and subsequently a communication breakdown between staff which led to the misunderstanding.Over the next few days we corresponded by email in order to make arrangements for me to be reimbursed the 20%. At all times the emails from the owner were courteous, very apologetic and friendly.Anyone can make a mistake, but it is how things are put right which is important, and I have absolutely no problem with how this was handled.I can't wait until I return to Singapore and get my teeth into that butter crayfish at Momma Kong's again

Visited in January of this year and loved everything we had! We opted for the set menu which included dumplings chilli crab ice cream and lobster. Can't wait to go back
4
Went here again in December and we were not disappointed
Had the black pepper crab and butter lobster
That butter sauce is omg delicious
The black pepper crab not as good as the chilli crab last time but still yummy
4
Best to reserve in advance. They also keep your table for you as long as you tell them you will be late. Went for the set meal for 2 and it didnt disappoint.
4
We had their top dish of chili crab with the jasmin rise and it was great. The service was also very food. Its a very simple place but if you look for chili crab, this is the place

I arrived late in the evening from a Melbourne flight. After taking the Metro into Chinatown from the Airport ($2.40 - very cheap), I stumbled across this place. Checking TA, it seemed like a safe bet as a first meal in Singapore. I ordered the chilli crab and the morning glory stir fry along with some fried buns. This was the first time I tried chilli crab. I have no idea how it compares to the rest, but I found the crab here really nice. The chilli sauce was more sweet than spicy which was ideal for me because I can‚Äôt take the heat. It was not overly sweet, just a hint. The sauce was rich with crabbiness and the crab itself was cooked just right. There are signs up saying that this is the most enjoyable chilli crab in Singapore - quite a claim. However, I can see where they are coming from and will take their word for it. The chilli crab itself was a reasonable $50. If you walk around, you will see quite a few tourist traps charging much more than this. Whilst I was there, I could tell that it was mainly tourists in the place. Although this was concerning at the start, it‚Äôs the meal which counts. I recommend this place wholeheartedly. By the way, my meal came to about $70 with all the extras. You could easily share my meal between two making it $35pp, but I‚Äôm a big eater. By the way, I would avoid the fried buns and stick with the traditional steamed ones. I wanted to give the fried ones a try but found it too oily for my liking.
4
This is the only place I've had chilli crab so I can't say how it compares, but I can say I really liked it! They have a de-shelling service, which is very convenient!It's not cheap (I had the set dinner, it was about $150 for 2 people), particularly for a place with such a casual vibe, but I do think trying chilli crab is a must do in Singapore.Be sure to get the fried buns, they're fantastic
5
Was in Singapore for the weekend in transit, went on Trip Advisor for crab recommendations and it was not wrong! This is the best crab I‚Äôve ever had - we also had the chilli crab which was equally phenomenal. Love the steamed buns but don‚Äôt recommend the fried ones, too rich. Service was great and highly recommend eating outdoors with a large ice cold draught of Asahi Will defs be back in the future and will dream of this crab for months to come
5
The crab was on the set price for $50 per pax I ordered chilli with the steamed buns to mop up the sauce. I could eat the sauce and crab everyday it was so tasty with just the right amount of spice. The venue was very modern and clean and the service was very good this is the place you want to go if you are a tourist who doesn‚Äôt want to get ripped off as it‚Äôs set price.Would definitely come again and recommend to friends

Read some really good reviews so decided to go for our first lunch in Singapore. We ordered the set meal for two (chilli crab, butter crayfish, garlic kangkong, fried and steamed mantou, grilled squid, ice cream, barley/water chestnut drink) First time trying chilli crab as I was told it is a must try dish when in Singapore. It said it was voted best chilli crab so we had to get it. I think it was more on the sweet side which I didn‚Äôt really like so it wasn‚Äôt my favourite dish. And the crab wasn‚Äôt very meaty so didn‚Äôt feel like we got what we paid for. (FYI Crab is $50 a la carte). The butter crayfish was pretty good tho, definitely would order that one again. The grilled squid and garlic kangkong was average and as you would expect it to taste. Honestly I liked the steamed mantou best so definitely not worth the money I paid for the whole meal. If you want to try a few things I would probably just order a la carte because getting the set meal doesn‚Äôt really save you that much more money. I paid about $155 (that‚Äôs including services and tax, it‚Äôs about $130 something before) with that said, you can find some pretty awesome buffets in Singapore for that price for two people (cheaper if you find a promo code)
5
Easy to see why this was voted the best chili crab in Singapore by the Lonely Planet. Food was great, service attentive with an easy going vibe. They asked if they could take our photo for their digital photo board they have on display & it was a lovely surprise when they gave us a copy of the picture when they brought the bill
3
Recommended by Lonely Planet so we expected good diner. We had better diners at hawker centers like satay lau pa sat for 1/3 the price
4
It was my first chilli crab and it won't be my last. Delicious. I went with steamed buns and rice but you could just stick with the rice. Some people try and eat crab with chop sticks but seriously, just hook in......
5
Visited this place with my 7 year old Daughter on recommendation of good search results for Chili Crab places near downtown Singapore. Loved the food and service! And it is not very expensive !
5
Loved this place ! Great staff and of course I ordered the signature chilli crab with the steam buns ! Delicious ! Totally recommend this place and it is located right near china town food street which has some stalls to browse.
4
Just back from Singapore. I was curios to try famous crab of momma kong 's. We went after visiting Chinatown, it's just in a parallel of pagoda street. I took chilli crab with fried montout. For me was special, unfortunately is not easy to eat, you have to use hands and the risk to get dirty is high. My husband didn't like the ceremony to open the crab and he had cereal crayfish good but not special. Restaurant is very small you have book in advance or go there very early as we did
4
Momma Kong‚Äôs is not really designed for long leisurely dinners. The lights are bright and the chairs aren‚Äôt particularly comfortable. But, it‚Äôs friendly and clean and the food is good. The specialty is crab, and they have a number of different ways you can have it cooked. I‚Äôve eaten chilli crab in many different places in Singapore, and though this version didn‚Äôt have the kick I prefer, it was definitely not a bad version.If you‚Äôre fueling up for a walk through Chinatown, or on your way out to the bars, it‚Äôs a good choice. They take reservations, but the Saturday night we were there wasn‚Äôt busy so you probably won‚Äôt need one
5
Our last stop and last meal on our month long European holiday. 2 nights in Singapore and how could you stay in Singapore and not have the famous Singapore crab.... Only reason we stayed on our way back home to Australia.Loved it Loved it Loved it. Just do it. Book in advance and go. Small place but great staff and service. Oh and the crab was AWESOME!!!!!!
4
Tried the chilli crab here and it was wonderful and nice. We ordered one between us with rice and buns which was more than enough as the portion size is generous there. De-shelling the crab took some time and effort but I guess its all part of the experience.The only thing I would change is to get the steamed buns instead as the fried ones were too greasy
5
Went to this restaurant on recommendation of Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. We had booked for the eight o'clock sitting on the Saturday night and were gald we had as it was very busy. However, the kitchen work very hard and and no one is kept waiting. We cheated and had the staff de-shell our crab and it certainly helped. Staff were all very helpful giving advice on quantity of food to be ordered. If I lived in Singapore this would be a regular haunt for my wife and me
4
We loved our meal here and very glad that we didn't go for the banquet for 2 as there is no way we would have been able to eat it all. We chose to use the de-shelling service, we were earned by staff that this would cause a long wait for our meal but it still arrived quickly. It is a pleasantly buzzy place with friendly helpful service and the food is so tasty plus crab prices are set and not reliant on the daily market price. Don't just go for the crab though - the cray are divine!Enjoy
3
We visited this cafe style restaurant in Singapore during a short stay in the city.very over rated.and very overpriced for very average food- could not recommend it- give it a miss!
3
They got very nice Chili crabs nice place, good service. However I tried tofu Chips It was awful I don't recommend y'all to try it, and Jasmine rise was microwaved.
Overall It's good Place to eat Chili crabs.
3
This place have an interesting menu selection. I have tried their famous Chilli crab and felt that it is nicely done. Prices are also reasonable here.
5
We followed recommendations for chilli crab, booked a table and were not disappointed. Chilli crab, fried and boiled mantou washed down with the ubiquitous Tiger beer, is there a better way to spend your last evening in Singapore?
5
On an overnight layover in Sg, I knew wanted to eat chili crab somewhere other than my usual spot (Palm Seafood @ marina bay) and luckily found good reviews of Momma Kong's. my wife and I ordered the bee hoon crab and the standard crab. Both are good, but the bee hoon was the winner. The mantau here are excellent, too. I would recommend coming here for chili crab at least once whenever in Sg. The place is small and would suggest making reservation online.
5
Everyone and lots of news /tv reviews said this was the place to go in Singapore for Chilli Crab and they were right, it was very nice! Very friendly staff, pleasant, smiling and very efficient. Chilli crab was cooked beautifully [thank you chef] and my partner had the Pepper Crab Fried Rice [very filling], also cooked to perfection, a very enjoyable meal all washed down with a cold Tiger beer. They even took a photo of us dining and gave it to us at the end.Casual small dining cafe, so you need to book in advance [via website is easy to do] if you definitely want a table at a specific time, otherwise you can walk in off the street [about 8 people did just that in the 1 hour we were there]. I found the place easily from taking the MRT to Chinatown, about a 3-4 min walk. Price was $48 for Chilli Crab and the Black Pepper Crab Fried Rice was $25++ presented well and cooked lovely and was very yummy
4
We had very high expectations for Momma Kong's given the great reviews and being a China Town favorite. While the restaurant atmosphere feels pretty local, the food was just ok. I guess with high expectations you want to be wowed with the crab. But even with the high expectations we did like the Bee Hoon crab we ordered. Will go with the chili crab next time
5
The well known seafood / crab chain "Extra Large" was booked so I went online and found this little gem. Converted shop house for great atmosphere, easy online reservation, and great food. All combined for a wonderful experience. Deep Fried Mantou were the best. Had to order a second set to mop up all the gravy
4
Came here with my family, as it was a recommended spot to have chili crabs in SG.We ordered a ton of stuff... but I specifically ordered the chili crab, steamed and fried buns, and tofu chips.Chili Crab - star of the show! This was so delicious in every aspect. The crab was giant, and the sweetness of the meat was still there... even with the excessive chili sauce. The sauce was thick, and perfectly seasoned. I literally mopped up every drop of sauce with those delicious fried buns.Tofu Chips/Fries - not sure what compelled me to order these. I'm not a big fan of tofu on its own. But fried, they sounded interesting. The server also recommended them stating they were popular. I wasn't impressed. They weren't at all crunchy on the outside. It was just deep fried, spongy, tofu sticks. Soggy outside, spongy inside. Very bland.The service was kind of eh... we were rushed from the second we walked in. They greeted us, and informed us that a large reserved party was due to arrive within the hour. They were only willing to seat us if we could finish in under an hour... why didn't they just lock the doors and wait for that large party then?..
5
The restaurant is not flash but what a meal. We ordered the 4 person banquet and couldn't eat it all. Chilli crab was sensational. If we ordered again would get two chilli crabs. Service was brilliant. I'd suggest to book online beforehand as we went on a Monday and most tables were booked
4
Worth a visit, great range on the menu but it's hard to go past the chilli crab. Small space but great service.
4
Awesome place for fresh delicious crabs. Tried the stingray too and it was spicy with a kick and yummy! Staff were very friendly and helpful. Best to call and reserve a table in advance. Can be quite full during peak hours.
5
We normally eat at Jumbo Seafood for chilli crab when in Singapore for convenience but we were recommended Momma Kong√Ç¬¥s and so pleased we did. It does online reservation so I was expecting something large and impersonal but it was small and cosy and despite being busy, they held our reservation even though they had no idea if we would be arriving!,Absolutely great food and atmosphere. The guys were so friendly and made us feel very welcome. Service was fast and price was comparable to other similar Singapore restauarants. 5 stars
5
We visited Momma Kongs whilst on our honeymoon last year. Although we ate in "fancier" restaurants this was by far our favourite meal of the whole honeymoon. It was shear joy and we hardly spoke to each other whilst breaking through the chilli crab! We also had steam and fried buns, squid and greens; all of which were excellent. Friendly and prompt service in a chilled out atmosphere. The restaurant is quite small and gets very busy but it was easy to book online. When we return to Singapore we will certainly return
4
Booked here well in advance of going to Singapore based on Lonely Planets review and given our hotel was nearby. Asked for room indoors knowing it would be hot. arrived to be told that we had to sit outside even though there were 3 spare tables inside. Then told it was 'first come first served' on reservations. At this point my wife decided just to sit down inside and they gave up trying to force us outside. Well that wasn't the best start but the food was really good and we loved the chilli crab. We had a set menu that included this which was great value. Definitely recommend..
5
A was recommended Moma Kong's by a friend and had to give it a try. I had dinner with my wife, I am not a big fan of crab, however I loved this one. I found the place a bit pricey but this is Singapore. Tip: It's a very small restaurant so -as in most of good restaurants in Singapore- I strongly recommend to book a table in advance
4
Random google search found this place and I'm so delighted we did Went for an early dinner on a Wednesday so was quiet at 5.15pm We ordered the butter lobster and chilli crab and they were so good, the butter sauce I couldn't get enough of, wished we could bottle it and take it home We also had a lime juice which was pretty good and the chocolate gelato which was very nice if you like dark Rick chocolate which we do Have to try this placeCan't wait to go back
5
I made a reservation online and they called to confirm, and were extremely patient and helpful when I had to reschedule my reservation. Our waitress gave great recommendations on what to order, and it was just right for our group of 3. We ordered a small crab bee hoon which was amazing, and an upsized chilli crab which was delicious. I'll be bringing all my foreign guests here in future
5
Good sized crab at really reasonable prices. There is of course the well known restaurants, but after walking past and looking I decided they were over rated and went exploring. Very glad I did. Small place, gets busy at peak hour so make sure you book. Alternatively turn up for a late lunch and you can generally walk straight in. Large crabs and the Mantou was excellent (kinda a soft bread) we liked steamed and fried, but fried was the overall winner
3
This place was highly recommended by friend. I am not saying that this place is not great. The staff on the night I visited the place were superb, they were very attentive but not too much. Staff were Happy to help and always very responsive. The foods were on the expensive side for the size of the crab. We ordered 3 different kind of crabs and some other dishes and ended up with more than $300. It was for 4 adults and 2 children. Although the place is in a nice small shop house with great service, I don't feel satisfied leaving the place. If you want to try because of the reviews, please do so. For me, I have tried once and won't be coming back. There are other places in singapore that can give you great crab dishes (if you know one, please share, I am asking locals to give me their favourite place). Ask locals, and you won't be disappointed
5
This was a small maybe 10 table place where you definitely need to make a reservation if you want to eat here. Easy to find, great service and fantastic food.
4
A friend invited us to have chili crabs with them at Momma Kongs. Situated right next to Chinatown the taxi driver knew where it was. Service was fast and efficient. They even did some reorganization when we had an extra 2 ppl turn up. Food was fresh and delicious and the atmosphere was fun. The staff took a photo of the group and gave it to us with the bill. So cute.
3
Happy enough to eat here (pepper crab + mantou) but staff act like they have too many awards and write ups to care. In an area which comprehensively offers great service, an offhand manner sticks out like a sore thumb. I dare say people like Lonely Planet may reconsider in future. Small and clean
4
We really enjoyed our black pepper crab and mantou buns but found the service to be less than excellent. My partner ordered a draft cider from the menu and was presented with a bottle of cider of a different brand. No explanation until he asked. Then when he ordered a second pear cider he was served apple cider. Some of the wait staff seemed more engaged with their cell phones than customers. For the price I would expect excellent service to complement the delicious food.
1
This place is overrated, probably becasue 90 percent of the customers are expats. Dont let chinatown or the awards on the door fool you. the locals say not go to there because they are known to rip you off.. the chilli crab was undersized. the black pepper crab fried rice had little to no crab in it. the crayfish, we were only given two when the menu says it comes with three. the only thing that i found was nice was the fried Mantou. best crab i've had was in Tiong Bahru
5
We came as a group of four and order a set meal for 4 people. A set meal includes: 2 crabs(among Black Pepper Crab . Red Chilli Crab . Crab Bee Hoon Soup . Sarawak White Pepper Crab . Butter Crab . Fresh Steamed Crab . Grilled Crab);  4 mantou; 2 light bites (Tofu Chips . Luncheon Meat Crisps); CRAYFISH; 1 small plate; 2 vegetables; 1 fried rice and 4 gelatos for desert and 4 home brewed drinks. The asmostphere was nice and cozy. This restaurant is located in the heart of Chinatown so it is easy to find. During your meal, waiters will come to take a photo of you and printed i
5
Cool small restaurant in original renovated building in Chinatown Specialised blackboard menu - crab & crayfish mainly but who could ask for more? Crab can be chilli, black or white pepper We chose white pepper. Good size well cooked, delicious. Crayfish closely resembled Australian Balmain or Moreton Bay bug? But no matter good size and nicely cooked. Had rice and greens. Pretty much all round good.Nice change from the big chilli crab restaurants and maybe better value
4
We went to Momma with friends and kids, we had a great time, we took the menu for four and were not disappointed. Everything from pepper Crabs to Mantou was really good, we didn't go for chili crabs though. Despite the good quantities we thought it was a bit pricey but in the end quality is there and that's what matters !Overall we had a great time, from reading the reviews it seemed the place is more popular with tourists, having lived years in Sing i don't see why this should be the case, i would recommend it anyway
5
Dined at Momma Kong's on Good Friday and had high expectations from the superlatives used in this webpage and did not disappoint. The restaurant is located on Mosque St adjacent to China Town, a quiet little street with some nice dining options. We chose the set menu with Spicy Crayfish, Chilli Crab, Squid and Kang Kong. Wow! For $120 this was a bargain. The Crayfish was absolutely beautiful and the Squid the best I have tasted, both as fresh as can be. The winning dish is the Chilli Crab however which was sweet, tasty and also very fresh. The set menu finished with a simple Gelato. More then enough food for two, I am still full to the gills as I write this. Will definitely return..
5
Went to this restaurant as it's one of the places in Singapore which does not have shark fin on their menu but serves chilli / black pepper crab etc. Small place with a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Just behind the touristy pagoda street in Chinatown. Chilli crab there has more of a sambal taste about it however thoroughly enjoyed along with the other dishes we had, garlic prawns & breaded chicken. Cold asahi beer on tap. Would recommend for good crab in a restaurant setting in singapore. Note that jumbo & no signboard restaurant chains support the sale of shark fin, if you care!

Crab dish at about USD 65. You must add taxes and charges to all prices in Singapore. Small restaurant. You must book in advance if you want a table. Favourite with tourists.

Amazing red Chilli Crab with fried mantou was a highlight dinner on a recent trip to Singapore. The Crab was delicious @ Momma Kong's and a fixed price to avoid over inflated market prices that others charge. Worth the trip to Chinatown.
5
Good atmosphere, nice staff and delicious food. I tried the classica red chili crab and the pepper one. amazing taste! +++

We FINALLY found the best crab resturant in Singapore! Wasn't disappointed with the size and the meat of the crab! always been disappointed everytime we try and eat crab from other restaurants. Most of their crabs are just shells. But will Momma Kong's you won't get disappointed at all! We ordered the package for 2pax. Very filling ang the size is good! call to make reservation if you want to have a table inside. We walked in on a weekday and there was no problem at all. We kept saying "ang sarap!" (Delicious!) so many times while eating. Heheheh We will definitely be back again! Best place to eat if you're craving for Crab
5
We ate large chile crab and pepper crab at Momma Kong's. The staff is super nice and they take your picture for the video feed!. Reservations are needed though we got lucky there was one table for 2 when they first opened that wasn't reserved. Food is terrific
5
This is the place for Singapore's legendary Chilli crab, washed down with a couple of ice cold tigers. I opted to have the crab de - shelled, which was a wise choice as the table across from me struggled with the mess. Even though the gent had a bib on he was covered in the sauce. But all part of this sensational dish.
5
That's the statement this restaurant makes on its own website and I have to say I'm in total agreement!This was my second visit and it was very bit as good as my first. I love the way everything is a little laid back in the restraint except the service and food which are vert,very good.The crab and other seafood are consistently excellent and I look forward to many more visits.One of my favourite restaurants anywhere.

Momma Kong√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this is my first time to this place and the last. I seriously believe that I could have gotten a better occurrence in this restaurant, judging from reviews. The place was already crowded when I arrived at 7 pm on a Monday night, been on my own I decided to give the pepper crab a go, but fortunately the taste was not to my palate, the crab was very dry and the pepper sauce was mixed with some chilli paste, honestly it was awful the pepper sauce should be of pepper not mixed with other contractions, all the ingredients did not connect, my pepper crab experiences was very poor choice. The bill come up to slightly over $90 including 2 rounds alcoholic drinks. This place is expensive and poor value for money definitely overpriced! I should have known better the place is mainly for tourists. But on a good note, the staff are pretty spontaneous and friendly

 My wife and I visited Singapore for the first time after Christmas, following a trip to the Philippines to attend a major family event, and we made it a point to sample some of Singapore's signature dishes. We tried Hainanese Chicken Rice our first night and Fish Head Curry from Banana Leaf Apolo the following day. For our last full day in Singapore, we headed out to Chinatown to try Chili Crab at Momma Kong's. Our initial research pointed to No Signboard Seafood as the place to get chili crab. However, recent reviews of No Signboard Seafood point to a decline in dining experience so we decided to give Momma Kong's a try. Reservations are highly recommended as the place was quite popular and cozy, with indoor and limited outdoor seating. Even in late December, it was hot and humid in Singapore and indoor seating with AC is preferable. We made a reservation for 2 for 5:00 PM, right when they open. They must get busy since we were informed they have a 7:00 PM reservation for the same table and they hoped we would be done by then. I was a bit put off by that but I knew we would not be lingering that long so no harm no foul. I ordered the red chili crab (Sri Lankan mud crab fresh flown daily - at least that's their claim) with jasmine rice. My wife, a self-proclaimed "lazy eater" opted for the prawn fried rice. For starters we shared the fried tofu chips with a zesty tomato-based dipping sauce. To round out our order, we ordered fried mantou and a couple of refreshing calamansi juices (on the menu as lime juice). The chili crab was the unquestioned highlight of our dinner...and it got messy. The chili gravy wasn't spicy and even had a hint of sweetness. The crab was fresh and I had to work to extract the meat...for the both of us. They can de-shell the crab for a fee ($15?)...but where's the fun in that? Needless to say, I used multiple napkins (so rare to find napkins in restaurants in Singapore) during dinner. The prawn fried rice was good as well as were the fried mantous. The fried tofu chips were also a hit. Based on food alone, we were inclined to give this place 5 stars. However, I rate on the entire dining experience. So what were the negatives? For starters, we didn't ask for but we were served these coated peanuts. They were OK...nothing special. We thought they were complimentary only to find out we were charged $2 SGD (Singapore Dollars) for them. We also used the wet napkins on the table (of course...this was a crab place and it gets messy)...and was charged $0.60 SGD for them. Oh yeah, we also found out they added a 10% Service Charge for a dinner for 2! I just can't help but feel like we were being nickeled and dimed for what already was a relatively expensive meal...just took away from the experience.Dinner for 2 came out to just under $108 SGD...or about $75 (US) in "real" money.

I sincerely believe that i could have gotten a better experience in this restaurant, judging for the look of the crabs around. But i decided to trust the menu that said to try the black pepper crab rice. Just average to push it, very dry and with the ingredients not connecting (seemed rice mixed after cooked with crab). Not only the rice was dry but strangely also the crab. Again, i do believe that with another dish in this restaurant i could be doing a very different review, but this option is in the menu and was by comparison with other crab rices experiences a very poor choice. Also the service was cold and rushed. I was surprised that my plate was thrown to the middle of the table when the waiter was passing by
5
I had the Grilled whole crab and the flavour was so delicious!!
I will be back for more.
Great atmosphere for a small Restaurant and young polite staff.
Well worth the visit.
4
Had a great chili crab meal and offered the best way to select the dishes for 4 people without it being a too expensive option.
Make sure get the bread with the crab...
Highly recommend if in Singapore and book first.
5
Really nice establishment, went with my boyfriend, friendly staff and tasty food. We went for the set menu which had Chilli crab and crayfish, both were tasty and the buns that goes with the chilli crabs. So good, if you're in the area, or in Singapore, it's worth a trip there! =

Ordered the black crab pepper fried rice and a vegetable side dish. Great experience for a local restaurant located just off the main touristy hustle of Chinatown. The servings were just right for one person and the food came out pretty quickly. It is advisable to make a booking ahead of time from their website especially if you're going in a large group. But tourists please BEWARE. The wet towel and peanuts on the table are NOT free. I fell for it and paid an extra $2-3 when I actually had wet towels right in my purse but maybe this is common for restaurants in Singapore
1
Visiting of this place was one of my biggest mistakes in Singapore.It was first place in the world where I should pay for serviettes!I am totally disappointed. They are trying to trick and fool their clientsFirst of all before I made my order guy put on my table one wet serviette and few peanuts.I ordered rice with shrimps for 18 SGD and 1 cup of tea for 3 SGD. I was expected to see 21 SGD in bill.And what did I see in my bill?1) 30 cents for wet towel which I didn't order;2) 2 SGD for peanuts which I didn't order;3) Extra taxes for all these items in my bill.So totally I paid 27.5 S$ instead of 21 S$.As I told it was first place in the world where I should pay for serviettes. It's a shame!P.S. Rice was not so good. So so. And tea was from cheap teabag
5
We tried the 'well known' places. Over priced and really just OK. Really don't bother... This place was just outstanding both for the price and quality.It's very small so book early and if you want to take your time I suggest weekend around 3pm is very quiet and you can relax.Plan on coming back a few times, the chilli crab is brilliant, but then you need to try the pepper crab and then the butter crab. :)Make sure you order the bread (Mantou) and get try both steamed and fried.Make a day of it, visit the Buddha Tooth relic, China Town then end here.
3
I should have followed my instincts and walked out as soon as a saw this place was frequented mainly by tourists and found somewhere more local?Having ordered chilli crab and one of the fried rice dishes it arrived in just a couple of minutes which is normally not a good signThe crab was precooked and had hardly any meat within the dish other than the two main claws?The chilli source was okWhat helps make this place expensive and poor value for money is the 10% service charge and 7% tax giving us a bill of S$ 140 for essentially two dishes and four beer
5
We went there with 3 people, and had a 2 person banquet (we may have added 1 dish), it was enough food. Great taste, fresh and spicy. There were so many good looking dishes on the menu, just not enough time to have them all 
4
we went there with 4 people and went through the menuemost value you get from the set for 4and you have a variety of different dishesfood is clean and yummydon't expect: another bowl for yr bones [if yu ask for a second for the other couple]use yr cleaning lemon tissue savely: you have to pay for another one!a bit loud if the location is full [and it was]all in all a worthy place to go
3
Maybe we were expecting too much since we have heard everwhere that we have to tried the famous Singaporean Chili Crab.We ordered the set menu which has: Prawns, Chili Crabs and Squid.It was average. The crabs were not as fresh as we will have like. It tasted more like a tomato sauce than chili
5
Superb food, really a good place. It is expensive for it is but you are paying for the quality of the ingredients as you can tell while you are eating the fabulous food.
5
Had a casual lunch here. The food was great! Loved the flavor of the black pepper crab. Steamed buns are huge! Very friendly service.
5
I booked a few weeks in advance and this was my first dinner in Singapore. I did not want to miss out on the Singapore Chilli Crab. The sauce was wonderful. I had to have 4 buns to mop up all the sauce. Highly recommended.
5
Best Singapore chilli crab we've had! The set menu is definitely value for money; just go on an empty stomach! Everything was amazing and the service was fantastic. Don't miss out on this amazing restaurant, and book in advance!
5
We lived in Singapore twenty five years ago and loved the seafood: chilli crab, pepper crab etc. We used to go to the East Coast, but the food there has become expensive and the service not great.Up steps Momma Kongs, a small restaurant in Chinatown specialising in crab dishes. Good service, great food and good value fixed prices (crab 48 Sing).The first night we called it was fully booked, so we booked for the second night. Great decision. We had chilli crab, barbecue sambal ray, shanghai greenstice, buns and a couple of beers for S$125. The food was lovely, the service great and the ambience just right: not noisy, not quiet. Everyone enjoying the food.Would definitely recommend for seafood lovers
5
We went to Maxwells Food Centre first, but it was such a grubby sorry affair we came here instead - great decision! We shared the $118 menu for 2 between 3 of of us, it was plenty. Black Pepper Crab, grilled squid with the most amazing lime chilli sambal, crayfish with curry leaves and birds eye chili, garlic greens, black sesame ice cream. All superb....Mosque Street is lined with interesting places.
4
This place has a good reputation for chilli crab and its easy to see why. Really enjoyed the food and the service was good. The atmosphere was a bit 'quiet' and it was very warm in the restaurant as there didn't appear to be any air conditioning
5
Great place to go and try chilli crab - we got the set menu - with greens, squid, mantou( small rolls for mopping up sauce), butter crayfish and the chilli crab. With two large beers it all came to $160 for two people - the food was excellent quality and was a great place to try the crab. they even have a nice wash basin set up for cleaning your hands after cracking all the crab. a nice touch too was they give you a photo of the meal. will go again
5
My husband and I went here for our last dinner of our trip in Singapore. We couldn't decide which place to go for crab and went here because we saw the great reviews and our hotel mentioned how great it was. They were right! The place is fun, friendly, and most importantly has amazing and fresh crab. My husband especially loved the crayfish
5
Forget all the over priced tourist traps...if you want great tasting Singapore or pepper crab to tick off you bucket list of the must to do things in Singapore..this is the place. Its more than a bucket list destination its high quality food and great service no hidden cost (market value???) This place will actually want to make you come back again and again..try the tofu chips and the Cray fish also great.I struggle with why tourist informations centres only recommending over priced tourist traps and not wanting to support local talent....this place has got it, great vibe & service , great food and reasonably priced...worth a visit
5
We found this restaurant via web search. And it exceeds our expectation! The food here are amazing blend of fresh seafood and chef's creativity. The service is great and staff was kind to take a picture and print for us!!
4
We were early so have to wait quite a while for our table to be ready.
Food was good as usual but we were disappointed that the sambal Ikan Billis are taken out of the menu. The Luncheon meat chips were fantastic.
5
This is the fourth time eating here and have only been living in Singapore for 5 months. Their Chili Crab is the best :-)!!! Even our guests from abroad loving it too!!!
5
OMG!! The chili crab served at Momma's Kong is absolutely amazing !! You gotta try it as its Singapore signature dish and u won't be disappointed - the place has a very hipster vibe and is close to Chinatown . Also try the fried mantous - wow these little buns were amazing ! Prices are on the high end but it's worth it .
5
If you want to try some of the best Singaporean food and try to avoid the usual crowds, you must come here, located in Chinatown, a nice restaurant with super friendly service, the chili crab is amazing, fried tofu with chili sauce eat like French fries and the salty fish fried rice is also recommended
5
I once thought that there is no restaurant can compete with Lion city for chili crab, but Momma Kong's proved me wrong. The restaurant is located in a convenient place with a reasonable price with only $48 for a 650 gram crab. I suggest that you should book before coming because the restaurant is usually crowded
4
I used to go to the east coast for chili crab until a friend recommended this place. It is a small restaurant with very friendly and helpfull service. They are famous for their chili crab and I must Admit: it is the best I ever ate during any stay in S'pore! Succulent crab meat & tasty chili. I also ordered the stier fried rice with prawns which was very nice as well. A must eat when you visit S'pore
5
Small and very popular restaurant specialising in chili crab and other crab dishes. Decent size crab. $48 per crab dish. Tried both the black pepper and chilie crabs. Highly recommend to add the fried Mantou as sides. Perfectly done to be crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
5
Hands down the best place we have eaten in Singapore (over two separate trips)! We booked into Momma Kong's for our arrival last Friday night and we were not disappointed. My partner and I shared the two-person set menu with the buttered crayfish and chilli crab, and both fried & steamed buns. It was DELICIOUS! The crayfish was absolutely mouth watering, and my partner inhaled the crab! Highly recommend, we will be back on our next trip
4
I ordered the 2 pax set menu ($118++) set meal. The chilli crab tasted great and fresh, matched well with the fried and steamed mantous. Cereal Crayfish was very fresh and pretty good too. Grilled squid was ok only, as the grilling taste was too bitter. Stir fried Dou Miao was a total disappointment because it was so bland. The black sesame and passion fruit gelato was not bad. Service was prompt and friendl
4
We had 3 crabs, the crab bee hoon and black pepper crab was pretty fresh. However our chilli crab wasn't as fresh. However, overall still a good experience and affordable crabs!
5
Simply Great food!!!
Simple, clean and worth while checking out!
Recommended to book in advance .....
5
I went to several Jumbo Seafood outlets in the past, but have converted to Momma Kong¬¥s for Chilli Crab now. Great food, excellent service and very calm. I¬¥ll be back soon
5
We were warmly welcomed, nice atmosphere. Excellent chili crab, sambal stingray and garlic prawns. But the Black pepper crab beated my previous favourite restaurant in Singapore for 25 years, I was totally blown away. Fantastic !
5
Didn't know what to order so did the meal for 2 omfg how good, squid was amazing, the butter crayfish is to die for and don't get me started on the chili crab. Plus it's such a cute little restaurant a definite Singapore hidden gem
4
Arrived at Momma Kong's early to secure a table. The restaurant is small, clean and a bit hipster. The staff were welcoming. The menu on the blackboard describes a range of crab and other specialties. As I was alone I had the pepper crab and it was good. It seemed a little cool rather than piping hot as my neighbors but the flavor was good. I had it with rice. I ordered mango sorbet for dessert and it was served in a packaged cup with a spoon in the lid. I would go back to Momma kongs and try other specialties as there were many intriguing choices.
1
My wife and I lunched here today. We had the crab meal for 2. This included 1 grilled crab, 1 butter crayfish (this turned out to be 3 mudbugs), 1 grilled squid (barely warm), 1 Shanghai greens, 4 steamed mantous (a sort of bun), 2 gelato (2 small tubs), 1 beer and 1 apple juice.For this we got charged $163.70. They added in $2 for some sort of peanuts we didn't ask for and 60 cents for 2 paper serviettes. The food was pretty average and we went away hungry
5
Small restaurant with cosy atmosphere. I ordered the black and pepper crab with the fried mantou, it was delicious. They have a de-shelling service at 15 SD which was convenient. The price was a bit high (at 48 SD per crab + extra for de-shelling) but it was worth it
5
We love the black pepper crabs and grilled crab. I always lick the sauce clean. The place is cozy, staff is friendly and always remember our names, even check to make sure we didn't forget to put in a space for our baby :)Very unique retro experience that represent the cooler side of Singapore.
5
No trip to Singapore is complete for me without having crab. Having been somewhat disappointed on my last visit, I scoured Trip Advisor for recommendations and came across Momma Kong's so decided to visit at the beginning of my stay.This is indeed a small, no frills restaurant but was full of a mixture of locals and tourists. They do take bookings, so be sure to do so if you are a larger group or want to eat at a prime time.I personally prefer black pepper crab, so decided to try this although there is the traditional chilli crab, or indeed other different means of preparation. As I was by myself, I skipped a starter but some great dishes on the menu including squid, prawns and other different vegetables.My black pepper crab took me almost an hour to devour. It had a good kick to it with the pepper, was full of meat and flavour. The side order of buns was light and buttery, I could have eaten a lot more!Service was great, they took excellent care of me as a solo female traveller.I wouldn't hesitate to return here and it was just a shame I didn't have more time on this trip to do so to try other dishes on the menu
5
Staff was attentive and flexible with seat changes. All in all, good food, great service, and pleasant ambiance. Certainly will make a return trip!
3
food was really fresh but that was it. I couldn't find anything special. It wasn't bad but i've had better than that.
5
We loved this place. So friendly small and unique. Food was amazing and lots of locals eating there too which says a lot!! Would definitely come back if we're in Singapore!!
5
Momma Kong's does some of the best crab in Singapore. Unlike the hawker experience, it has air conditioning - a big plus. We had the 3 crab special deal: chilli, black pepper, and bee hoon. The BBQ stingray is also great.
4
We really wanted to try Singapore's staple dish Chilly Crab so while we were in Chinatown we found this place in our LP guide. We decided to give it a go and it proved to be an interesting experience. The only thing that prevents me in giving it five stars would be that I simply don't like crab meat. The restaurant is specialized only in this kind of food, has a few tables inside and a couple outside, it's a small, cozy place.We tried the set menu for two, which contained a portion of Chilly crab, some crayfish, a side of greens, four buns and two sorbet icecreams for desert. The food was cooked ok, but as I previously stated I am nuts about crab meat and the entire experience of having to get your hands dirty to crack the shell just isn't for me. Despite that, I only have words of praise for the hefty portions, good and balanced flavors & super friendly staff.The total amount of the bill (with drinks) was close to 120 SGD, not cheap, but this is Singapore.To summarize it, this would be a paradise for crab meat lovers so it comes highly recommended if you're into this kind of food
4
Restaurant located in a quite corner of Chinatown facing the Mosque. It's a small restaurant with about 38 seats of which ~28 were indoors. Went with 3 friends so ordered their Meal for Four which had 11 dishes. I found to be really value for the price of $208. We had a choice of 2 crabs dishes (choice from 7), 1 crayfish dish (choice from 3), 1 grilled squid, 2 vegetable dishes (choice from 5), salted fish fried rice, 2 appetisers (tofu chips & luncheon meat crisps), 4 mantou buns (steamed or fried) & 4 gelato cups. All dishes were tasty and of good serving size. Crabs (650g Sri Lankan crabs) were fresh n meaty. We ordered their Chilli Crab and Crab Bee Hoon Soup. The chilli crab was decent but I won't say it's the best in Spore. I liked the grilled squid the most. Overall, I am a satisfied customer who will consider coming back with another 3 friends.
5
It was my mum's 68th birthday and she wanted a crab dinner as a gift. Since I'm overseas I didnt think I could satisfy her craving. Found Momma Kong's online. Extensive menu. Ordering was quick and easy. Delivery on time.Had a Facetime crab dinner with mummy. She was super surprised and swore it was one of the best crabs she ever had.All in all, a perfect gift
3
We had the chilli and butter crabs. Both were good and the "mantous" were especially delicious! The cereal crayfish was disappointing though, especially when you consider the price paid. Sambal kangkong was Ok and the black pepper fried rice was different and quite nice but a bit bland for me personally.
1
I really enjoyed the crab here. Which is why I'm sad to write this review. Upon getting my bill I noticed two charges: $2 for "tidbit" which I assume was the dish of peanuts that was given (not offered) to me, and $.30 for the hand wipe that was on the table when I got there. Really? Charging people for little amenities like that without telling them they come at a cost (however little), and without even asking if they want them? At a place that charges $48 for a crab, not including mantou? Sorry to say that left a bad taste in my mouth after a nice meal
5
We are in Singapore in our honeymoon and we have just proved the best crab of the world. Do not leave Singapore without prove it.There are different dishes and those we have proven were delicious. Besides the food, you find nice Staff, a well designed restaurant and we had the chance to receive a printed photo that they took from us!We will certainly come back to Momma kong's in our next visit to Singapore
5
One of the all time great meals
In no particular order
Red Chilli Crab
Spicy Crayfish
Grilled squid
Salted fish bean sprouts
2 steamed/2 fried mantou
Jasmine rice
Mandarin orange and black sesame ice cream

Wish we'd had time to return to this great find. The chilli crab was truly excellent... particularly with the crunchy mantou to sop up the chilli sauce! We also rated the butter crayfish which was beautifully cooked and plentiful. The mantou here is also excellent and although we usually eat mantou steamed, the slight crunch of the fried mantou with the chilli sauce was a fantastic combination. Would like to try the black pepper crab next time as others in the restaurant were discussing how great it was as well. This is a smallish restaurant so you should book to avoid disappointment, although hubby and I walked in on a week night and grabbed the last table. I would definitely book next time.
5
We ordered a chili pepper crab with mantous and a fried shrimp rice for two persons and we were really satisfied. Everything was delicious and the owners are really nice people. I can only recommend this place if you're looking for a small but modern restaurant to try this classic dish. You should also book a table online if you're planning to go there
5
Our Singaporean friends tracked Momma Kong's down as being somewhere to get butter crab for my chilli hating Wife. We certainly weren't disappointed. The staff were friendly and helpful, and both the butter crab and chilli crab dishes we ordered were wonderful, as was everything else we ordered. The set menu for 4 offered a really good selection of dishes. A brilliant discovery, and somewhere we will return to next time we're in Singapore.
5
Popped in here one night for chilli crab, its not a big place and we didn't make a booking but it was empty at the time and we were lucky there was only one table for two left that hadn't been reserved. We were not disappointed we came and went for the trio of crabs. Chilli, butter and black pepper.The only fault I could find was there was so much I couldn't eat anymore, my wife loved having a little extra. We can not fault the food or the service and highly recommend. The young lads who own it were also very friendly but please don't charge for the peanuts or at least tell people you have to pay. A highlight of my time in Singapore
5
We used to have crabs at Jumbo but no more after stung by high prices. This is our second time at Momma Kong. It's in the middle of China town, an unlikely locality for crabs. The crabs are about 48 dollars per serving. The chili crabs are yummy. The crab bee hoon heavenly. The sambal squid is worth trying also. The sambal and salted fried rice is pretty good.It's a small cosy restaurant so book ahead. The staff are really friendly and even take a picture for you with a hard copy to take home. Well recommended if you love crabs without the crowds normally associated with some other well known crabs restaurants
5
Usually I go to east coast for seafood in Singapore. This time a rush, so take this small shop and try. I order a set meal for two at SG 118. The crab is fresh and yummy. Other dishes are also very good. The service is excellent and they will take a picture for you, and let you take home after meal.Very clean and tidy. Remember to book table early, because seats are limited
5
After reading many reviews of the best places for black pepper crab in Singapore, we chose Momma Kong's in Chinatown.It was a great choice! It was the only place we found with a fixed price for the dishes, and they were delicious. The crab dish was generous and beautifully flavoured, the mantou (buns) light and fluffy and the extras we chose (fried rice and Shanghai greens) were also lovely. The staff were super helpful and friendly, and as a cute extra they took photos of anyone who gave permission, put them up on a rotating presentation screen, then presented a free copy with the bill.We would recommend this place to anyone for a great range of crab and crayfish dishes
5
We tried this place out on Sunday evening on our latest trip to Singapore. We usually include a crab meal each trip, in the past it's usually been one of the excellent ones on the East Coast. However, this place matches those, we had the set meal - we were absolutely stuffed full by the end of the meal. But it's not about quantity, the quality was excellent too. It's only a small place, so you might want to consider booking. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Another plus for this place is if you are staying reasonably central then if you go here instead of one of the East Coast places then what you save in taxi fares will more or less pay for 1 persons mea
5
Singapore is famous for crabs, but it's hard to tell which restaurant is really the best with crabs. One may specialize in chili crab, another with pepper crab and yet another one with crab beehoon. But if I'm to give an overall rating based on "good with all the different ways of cooking crab", I'll choose Momma Kong's as the top. Indeed, the different styles of cooking I've tried there have all turned out excellent, and it's value for money too. They're highly recommended.
5
We selected Momma Kong's as opposed to one of the more touristy establishments and weren't disappointed. The service was attentive, friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. The chilli crab and fried mantou were the favorites.
4
Crab Bee Hoon Soup was superb! Ordered Butter Crab but they sent us Chilli crab, Chilli crab was really so so as it tasted not as fresh as crab bee Hoon soup
4
Steam mantou was good with the Chilli crab sauce! And it's 48$ per crab, it's not easy to find a cheap crab deal in Chinatown tourist area tho. Their Chilli crab has a vey unique zesty taste, not like the usual spicy Chilli crab sauce! MOST PF MY POINTS TO MOMMA KONGS would be the freshness of the crab! Will definitely go again. Do remember to make reservation online first!
4
Easy to find, cosy place to chill and enjoy the food. But we think it is too cold with both aircon and fans on (makes the food cold faster too).Food was yum! We enjoyed the food, everything was a bit different from what we usually have at other places (in a good way). Well ventilated kitchen as well, we left the restaurant without any smelling like food. A nice area for washing hands, really thoughtful.
3
I was pretty excited to check this place out after reading all the reviews. And having never tried chili crab before, it seemed like a pretty good place to get inducted. I ordered the de-shelled black pepper crab fried rice dish (SG$25) and was disappointed to notice there was barely any crab and just one small crab claw in the middle. It was more of an expensive fried rice dish than a crab meal. That plus a Corona for SG$12 and a wet towel (yes, they charge for that) brought the bill to $41.05. I wouldn't have had an issue with the price for the dish if there was just more crab in it. After all, isn't that what this place is all about
1
Ordered the set meal for 4 person. Cabs were cook in 1 favour. Crabs dishes were served cold. Not fully cook. Sambal kangkong was not cook properly also. Fried rice was overcook before fried. As compare to my 1st visit few months back standard was getting bad
5
We came to Momma Kong's after finding it online when trying to find a more local place for Singapore's signature chili crabs. Man oh man you will not be disappointed! The service here was wonderful and it is run by a group of guys who put together the business together. They know the menu inside out and they also know their product. We did one of the set meals for 2 and got chili crabs, butter crayfish, grilled squid, a vegetable, 4 fried mantou, and gelato. We also then ordered another crab in the black pepper sauce separately. It was so much food between the three of us and each thing was more delicious than the next. The crabs were so fresh and the sauces were just right. Both the black pepper and the chili had a little kick to them, but it was not overpowering and was addictive. What I liked best was that the crab was obviously cooked in the sauce and it was not just thrown on top. This made the dishes much better and the flavor more complex. The crayfish was well cooked and tasted great as did the simple, but delicious grilled squid. Another highlight of the meal was the fried mantou, they are little fried bun that are kind of like the best crescent rolls you have ever had in your life. I could have eaten 12 and then still had 3 more to mop up the sauce leftover from the crabs. The prices are super reasonable compared to their competitors and the quality could not be any better

Went to Momma Kong's tonight.Phoned up for a table and not a problem ( outside but was great)Turned up and table reserved with name and no sooner sat down than served cold beverage.Food was some of the best if not the best Chilli and black pepper crab I have had in Singapore.Prawn fried rice was also a great serving and great food and some of the best fried rice portion wise I have had.The price paid was good value for money.I usually don't give a 5 rating but there was nothing tonight that could be classed as anything other than the rating given.I will be back and thanks for a great night
5
Tried this for the first time this weekend, and I wasn't disappointed. The Crab Bee Hoon soup, stingray, and spicy crab were excellent. My favorite was the cereal crawfish - a must try. Saturday for lunch was quiet, and the staff took great care of us. Looking forward to my next visit sometime soon
5
This place was great! We read about it in Lonely Planet and when we realised it was only 2mins from our hotel we thought we'd try our luck to get a table.. Lonely planet advises booking 2 days in advance so we weren't overly confident. However the lads were very accommodating and super friendly and let us sit outside on lovely Mosque street. We got there at about 5:30pm I think if we were any later we would have struggled. They also setup a highchair for our toddler and seemed super happy to have us :)We had one serve of Chilli Crab with a side of steamed buns and fried buns and some rice. More than enough between the 3 of us, but I wish we had time to go back and try more, because it was one of the best meals we've had anywhere. Set prices makes ordering really easy and smashing the crab was messy, delicious, amazingness. I don't know what was in the chilli sauce but it was a thick gravy-like texture, perfect to lick from every finger and every inch of the bowl. Loved it. Go here
5
Its small, its a bit hipstery, but they make some of the best chili crab on the island and its worth going out of your way to eat it.
4
Delicious food and good service. Size of the crab is smaller than Jumbo, but it's much cheaper. Must try the Crab Bee Hoon Soup!
5
Best Place in town for chili crab. Excellent atmosphere and music. The food was fantastic. Book ahead or you risk not eating at this must go restaurant.
4
As the title says, love the chili crab and crab bee hoon soup. Staff were friendly and attentive. Our first time but definitely not last.
5
Good experience. Food is special but not that up to standard. Service staff needs to improve as one was chewing all the way.
5
The place has a simple, laidback vibe. Service is professional and attentive. Price is reasonable. The crab dishes are very good: moist and spicy without losing the crab taste. Fried mantou is excellent for dipping in the sauce.
4
Had the de shelled chili crab with fried buns which were scrumptious as was the fried rice. Service was quick efficient and with a smile. Would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to couples (old) like us who remember the service and civility of previous years
4
My absolut favorite is the butter crab. I have been at Momma kongs a few time since it opened and it is really the best place to eat crab. I was armdeep into the sauce! Fingerlickin' good! If that is too much work for you, than they offer to de-shell the crab for an extra fee.
5
Really tasty and I've eaten at Jumbo, No Signboard, Mellben and Long Beach. This is my favourite in Singapore! Crabs were cooked perfectly, nice and succulent and the sauces were great. Is ideal for smaller groups as they serve Crabs which are around 600g at SGD 48 so you can try more flavours. Had the Bee Hoon and The Red Chili Crab between two people which were both really good.All in was around SGD 140 for two of us. Had the set for 2 people: 2 crabs, grilled squid, 4 Mantou, 1 veg and a Gelato each. Highly recommended
4
Didn't book a table, but risked going later @ 9pm. They had a table free. We ordered the set menu for 4 and chose 3 types of crab: black pepper,chili and peranakan, 2 green sides, 1 prawn dish and 1 squid dish, 2 fried and 2 steamed buns, gelato for desert. Tofu chips came for starters. The meal was delicious and catered well for 4 people. Be prepared to get real messy! Be aware that the nuts and wet wipes are not free and they stop cooking at around 9.30. The cost was $208 + drinks ( for 4 ppl) which i felt was fairly reasonable
5
They were recommended by a friend and it is a great restaurant. It's not fancy but the food was delicious, we had the chili crab, and the staff was awesome!
Make reservations and I highly recommend you go!
5
It's located in China Town. Overall good experience. Try to chili crab -- it's tasty and served well. Prices are relative to Singapore reasonable.
4
Went to Momma Kongs on a recommendation and they cook very good chilli crab, we had it served with a soft dumpling to soak up the sauce. All washed down with a local beer. If you are in chinatown and fact some crab, head for this place
4
Went for dinner as didnt have booking we thought we had a chance at 9pm and we got straight in.Had the set menu for 4 for 208 and couple of drinks for 246 total.The crabs 3 of had black pepper , chilli and Perakan crab. All 3 were good and sides were nice. Only gripe they charge you for nuts and wet towel which for the total price should be free
5
The crabs are just amazing. One of the most tasty things ever. And keeping in mind their popularity, the prices are still lower than in some other places. Service is nice as well. Reservation is recommended. We will keep coming here each time we visit Singapore
4
Managed to get a booking for that evening, despite it being busy. The food lived up to its reputation with great crab, be prepared to get messy though. The reason for 4 stars was simply down to the add on charges, which I didn't notice until I looked at the bill the next day, for the nibbles and wet towel which any other good restaurant provides as a matter of course. Staff were efficient enough but not the friendliest I've ever met
4
My girlfriend and me to roughly enjoyed our dinner - they offer a set dinner for 2 people for price of sgd 126 (excluding drinks) including - a choice of 2 crabs (choose from 7 different varieties). Crabs were decent size and tasted really nice- 4 steamed or fried buns called mantous ( loved the fried ones)- 1 vegetable dish ( we choose dou Miao and enjoyed it though it was new to us)Cannot compare quality or price-wise with other places in Singapore (as this was only place where we had crab), but a bottle of tiger at sgd 12 seems over-priced to me...Overall my girlfriend and me were very happy with the food. Service in beginning was good, but seemed to slack off as evening progressed. The waiters seemed to forget some things although must say they were very friendly....will go back agai

The restaurant located in a small street near Chinesetown MRT, about 5 mins walk so it's quite convenient. It has warm decorating with wood furnitures, the place is rather small in my opinion and its music is not too loud, so everyone can easily talk to each other.When you come there you can order a meal for two, for four or you can order a combo of any 3 crab dishes or you can just do a la carte. For us, we order a meal for 2. A meal for two there composed of 2 crab dishes, 4 mantou, 1 salad, 1 side dish and 2 gelato. We order chili crab, butter crab, 2 fried + 2 steamed mantou, samsa kampong, a dish of squid, orange and passion gelato. The chili sauce there was quite bland I would say, it could use more pepper to make it more tasteful. About the butter one, the sauce was ok, I rated it 7/10, because I think it needs more salt. But the crab cooking is good, it's sweet and rich. The mantou is very very good, it was the best mantou ever. The inside of the mantou is very soft and tasted just right. I prefer chili food so the samsa kampong is decent in my opinion. 2 other dishes is about 6/10.The price there is a little bit expensive in my opinion. It costed 150 S$ for the two-person-set (already included the tax and the service charges).In conclusion, if you are low on budget, don't go here. Otherwise, this is a great place to hang out
5
The set menu for four at $198 is enough for five people. Choice of three crabs in three ways. Steamed crab, crab bee hoon (rice noodles) are excellent. Crabs are fresh and succulent. The signature pepper crab is also packed with the aroma and warmth of black pepper and spices and you can still taste the sweetness of the crab meat. Seating is comfortable indoors. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great place to be if you are into crabs.
5
A visit to Momma Kongs was on my wish list for our trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint. We visited on Christmas day and I absolutely loved it, we had the set menu and chose chilli crab and black pepper crab. The chilli crab was my fave and we also had 2 steamed and 2 fried buns, the fried buns were my fave delicious to mop up all the gorgeous sauce. Crabs were big and very tasty and we even got a photo from the staff to bring home. The wine was very reasonable price for Singapore and the service was great. It is a must for any visit to Singapore
3
The perenankan crab is always my all-time favourite. The crab been hoon is fabulous! Scallops are tasty too.
Barley water is way too sweet.
Food has been consistently good.
However it is way too noisy that we have to leave early.
5
Heard rumors of this seafood delight and a delight it was! A must eat for all crab lovers and don't wear light coloured clothing! Awesome!
4
Small, cool, intimate, good value and juicy meaty crabs - the complete opposite of the normal trip to Jumbo or one of the other industrial crab places most end up at. We had the set menu for four people and ended up taking food home. The butter crab was the big surprise and will crabs were pretty fresh and lots of eggs - yum!Asahi beer on tap was a bonus.Very goo
5
It was my first time in Singapore and I was walking down the street and saw this sign. "The Best Crab Experience in Singapore". I said yeah right so I went in to find out. I had been walking and was hungry. I step into the restaurant and was greeted ready to sit down and they said sorry no reservation, please make one. I said are there any left for today and I was told no. We have them starting tomorrow, so I took a time just after lunch. I wanted to see if the food was worth it and waiting built up my anticipation. Or really in my mind "this better be good"Well my friends and I arrived back at this location ready to partake and give our piece of mind about the food. They have four different sauces they cook the crab in and we went with the Red Chilly Sauce, I was scared that it was just going to be hot. Well I was wrong it was delicious and everything else was good. We had Tofu fries I don't care much for tofu but my friends like it and I did like the look. I would recommend this restaurant and the sign is true.

I had enjoyed an awesome crab elsewhere in Chinatown earlier in the week so i am grading Mamma Kongs against my previous experience. The service was good, main course came out before the appetizer which was odd, not the end of the world but odd.I had a black pepper crab which is S$48. My crab was a bit smallish, i noted others had similar sized crabs so i would say you get what you pay for here. Its not the biggest crab in town, its also not the most expensive. The BBQ stingray was the highlight of the meal, very tasty. Be sure to order that! Service OK, good value, very casual place
4
Impressive service following reservation. Very friendly, they even provide you with a photo of you and the crab at the start of the struggle. Went for red chilli crab and fried mantou which was more than enough for one. Not too hot but you will get very messy dismantling your crab
5
We selected this place given the reviews on TA and it was only a few doors down the street, we were so glad that we went. We had heard that they have the best crabs in town and we couldn't imagine a better experience. We went with Ben and Roy's recommendation and did the pepper and butter crab meal, with the grilled calamari and the Singapore greens. Everything was absolutely perfect, couldn't have asked for anything better. Great food and friendly service. We went a little later in the evening so didn't think it was noisy at all.
5
Whenever our friends need a place to celebrate we book a table at Momma Kong's. They have all the staple crabs + my favorite the Butter Crab (amazing). They've also expanded the menu massively since it opened so there are now enough other options so we can invite non-crab eaters. Vs all the other crab places in SG that feel like traditional stuffy venues, Momma Kong's has a warm manager and great atmosphere that keeps us there until closing
5
We reserved a table online and got a timely reminder on the day via email. We arrived at the allotted time and were greeted warmly by the young staff.This place is unpretentious but fabulous value for money and the food is very very tasty! We had a set meal for two even though we were three of us, we just added an extra dish which was more than adequate.Garlic prawns and Bok Choy were the starters, these were excellent and tasty without the usual gluggy sauces.Then we had the famous Chilli Crab and Perankan Crab, served with hot sauces and done to perfection, the crab was succulent, all washed down with the quenching Tiger Beer, it also came with the Buns to soak up the sauces, brilliant, not to costly and the staff and amenities were very good. Highly recommended
4
In the middle of Mosque Street in Chinatown - clean, comfortable and not too big - so the service is good. The crabs are excellent - you choose from a broad selection - we tried 3 different crabs - Black Pepper, Chilli, and Grilled with steamed and fried buns, greens, some rice and of course chilled beer. I thought the chilli crab would be a little more spicy - the black pepper crab was an explosion on the tastebuds. Love it. Don't get the crabs dressed - buy them as is and spend time enjoying them
5
The full 2-person 2-crab set is a little too much food for two average eaters. The crabs are a lot of work to eat (and very messy!), but are delicious. Red chili sauce is best.
5
We love momma kongs. Really tasty food. Good value for money. Friendly staff who remembers who we are. One even called to confirm whether we are bringing the baby as he remembered us from a previous visit.
3
Venue: 8 mins Walking distance to Chinatown MRTRestaurant : Cozy place. Good for small group friends n family gathering dining. Happy with table size n spacious enuf to place at least 4 dishes n drinks for 4 seaters.Staff service : friendly n one free group pic for each table .Food- we ordered 2 types of crabs. Famous Singapore Chilli crab n Butter crab n 2 side dishes . Taste: crabs are tasty but average . Abit to our disappointment when the crab dishes were served slightly warm not steaming hot. We guessed the crab dishes were pre-prepared. Acceptable taste for the 2 side dishes - Grilled Sotong n vegetableValue for money : slightly over priced for the dishes in Chintown location. Each Crab size aren't that huge.Overall experience : Pleasant but food overpriced 
4
The restaurant is located in the more quite Mosque road amongst other places to the left and the right. It is run by young folks, which makes it a more cool place. The food is good (Chili and Pepper crab) and the have a beginners offer. With some beer you spend about 180 SGD.
5
We rocked up soon after shop opening (upon a Singaporean friend's recommendation) but were informed that all the tables were fully booked that night. To our surprise though, we were given the option of eating within 1.5 hours before the table reservation and we were glad they did!We had the chilli crab here and our taste preference liked this sauce more than any of the others in that it was not excessively spicy (compared to the very spicy Chinatown Seafood Restaurant) but it was spicy enough for a good kick (compared to the less spicy Jumbo Seafood); however this is certainly variable to personal taste. The staff members were friendly and lovely where they offer to take a photo of you in the restaurant and even print a copy for memorabilia (albeit not great quality, but hey, you can't have everything =) ). Overall a very pleasant dining experience
5
A group of us 7 were there - the staff were friendly and for a 3-4 pax set menu, we were stuff at the end of the night. There are many options even for the set menu - you can choose how you wanted your crabs done, the sides and vegetable dishes. Great option if you want to take a guest from out of town to
4
I had to try the traditional red chilli crab and went for one of the most recommended restaurants, Momma Kong's, which was close to my hotel. Without a reservation they made me a seat outside, which was OK, and then served me a great crab. A lot to eat and some work to get into parts of the crab, don't be afraid to get messy! A bit expensive but worth the money. If you like crab or want to try it, then I recommend this place. The staff was also very friendly. It's very close to Southbridge Bar and Restaurant where you can have a cocktail or a beer before or after the visit to Momma Kong
5
We had a very good time / meal here. Took the 2 person set menu and plenty of very delicious food arrived as soon as the kitchen had it ready (unfortunately not when we were ready, we were still fighting with crab #1, when #2 already arrived at our table, I asked if there was a way to keep it warm please, the best they could do was cover it with another plate) .. Simply everything was super tasty, I wish I could have eaten my chili crab hot, though. Can;t wait to return and try the other varieties. Ended up paying 140SGD for 2 people (food and sodas), which I find very fair. Be aware that the offered nuts and wet tissues are NOT free!
4
Reservation online - easy and quick! We ordered meal for two with one butter crab, one crab bee hoon soup, vegetables, 4 mantou, plus extra $5 for grilled scallop. Super delicious and service was good, we had a pleasant crab experience and will defo come back again
5
We were keen to try chilli crab while in Singapore and after lots of research on this website decided on Momma Kongs. It was good to be able to book online before we left Australia.We were so glad we chose this restaurant. The service was great and the food amazing. We had the set meal for 2 and chose the chilli crab, black pepper crab, garlic prawns (an extra $5 and so worth it, yum), shanghai greens and steamed mantou. We had so much food and it was all excellent. Good value for money overall.One of the staff took our photo when all the food arrived and they gave us a copy when they presented the bill, which was a nice touch.As this is our first chilli crab experience in Singapore we have nothing to compare it to but we couldn't fault anything and would definitely return
4
Good food and reasonable prices. Had 2 crab dishes, and selected others. Was very nice. Quite small, so may need to book a table.
Recommended
5
I booked specially ahead from Australia to make sure I got to eat here and it didn't disappoint. Found the prices reasonable and the freshness of the food excellent. Really enjoyed the chilli crab and would like to go back and try other sauces.
5
Loved our meal at Momma Kong's - lovely chilli crab and black pepper crab fried rice - crabby heaven. Service was excellent - we were very lucky to get a table as all seemed to be reserved, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
4
Nice environment to eat crabs. Chilli crabs gravy is a bit too little; black pepper crabs is a but too overpowering.
5
This was my first ever chilli crab experience and I'm so glad that we went to Momma Kong's! Staff were friendly and attentive, and needless to say that food was amazing. We tried a set menu for two. When the crabs arrived on our table, I thought it would be nice to have a finger bowl. But it didn't take 5 minutes for me to learn not to worry about wiping my hands because it was totally pointless!We made a huge mess on our table and wall but it was fun and totally worth it. And I'm glad that I made a booking as the restaurant was almost full on the Friday night we went
5
This place was recommended to me by a relative. We had the 4 person crab set which costed S$198, which includes 3 crabs and many other dishes totaling over 10. This is for sure a great deal if we compare this against the well known ones such as Jumbo's or No Signboard. We liked the Crab Bee Hon Soup the most, as it had all the flavours of the crab in the soup. We also had white pepper crab and Chilli crab, which were all very well made. The staff were friendly and helpful and we had a great time that night. Definitely will come back and I have subsequently recommended to many of my friends!

I stayed at China Town for my Singapore trip this time and every time I visit Singapore I always love to eat Chilli Crab. My Singaporean friend highly recommended Chilli crab at Momma Kong's and it's only 1 block away from my hotel, so I gave it a try. It's located in Mosque Street China Town and easy to find. This restaurant is not so big but simply modern and clean. I wanted to order the jumbo size of Sri Lankan Crab but they didn't have, so I tried regular size one, price was about 48S$ per dish and it's great to share for a party of two. Great food and serve very quick. Waiters here are motivated and took a good care of each table, they took photo at the table and printed it for every table for souvenir. I really like this idea. I will definitely go back to Momma Kong's for my next visit to Singapore. 2 Thumbs up!
4
Momma Kongs is a hipster crab place where they boast of the best crab offering in Singapore.It is run by young Singaporeans that will give you a good vibe. We ordered the classic chili crab for 48sgd not including the buns.It was really good. They did not scrimp on the ingredients. My only comment is they should put more sauce like how No Signboard seafood restaurant does it. But flavor wise it is packed with traditional Singaporean chili crabs.We also ordered friend buns which wasn't the typical round ones. It was bigger that the usual, also a bit more expensive. Highly recommended for the experience.They also took a photo of you and will print and give you a copy. Good job guys :

This is a new cool place to go to satisfy your chilli crab craving in Singapore. It is a rather small 30 seater restaurant in Mosque St near Chinatown. We had the set dinner for 4 at $198 and the portions were extremely generous and could barely finish the food. We had a choice of 3 crab dishes and we ordered the steamed crab in Chinese wine which had a deep rich flavour of the wine and the crab. The next crab dish was the Iconic Singapore chilli crab which was very good. The sauce was thicker and more like a rendang sauce rather than the more watery type at other places. It was great for dipping with the very excellent Mantou buns that came with it. This place makes one of the best fried Mantou's in Singapore. The last crab dish was the crab Beehoon and it had a very rich broth with the beehoon. Together with the set we got to sample the grilled scallops and squid and both were very nicely done and tender. They also served a generous helping of deep fried ikan bilis that was unusual in that it was yummy but very spicy! For carbo we ordered the prawn fried rice and this was one of the best fried rice we had as it had "wok hei" and was not oily. The fried rice went very well with the 2 vegetables dishes we ordered and that was the fried bean sprout with salted fish and "tou Miao". All in all it was a satisfying meal at a hip and modern crab restaurant
1
Absolutely avoid Momma Kong's at all cost. Menu says "whole crab and pepper rice". For $25 you get a bowl of rice with a sniff of crab...they put a small, underweight crab claw on the corner of the bowl for decoration. You then spend the rest of the meal hunting for any crumb of crab meat you can find in a bowl of pepper rice.Beer was $12 for a bottle of Tiger. Service was exclusively elusive, by backpacking tattooed transients.So disappointed for first meal in foodie rich Singapore
5
It's a small cosy environment, most importantly good food and good service which is definitely a plus in Singapore! Price is also very reasonable, will definitely go back for it!
3
Small restaurant near chinatown with friendly waiting staff but the food does not blow me away. There are much better chilli crab restaurants(Jumbo) in Singapore. Chefs came out into dining area but looked so grumpy and did not engage with any customers.
5
Great crabs! Would be good if they do not place time restrictions or at least be more flexible when customers are unable to finish the food within the time restrictions.
4
My girlfriend and I were in search of a place to taste this local specialty, and we found this restaurant in Chinatown. The food was delicious (although be warned that the pepper sauce is quite spicy!) Also, even if I√Ç¬¥m not usually a fan of trendy restaurants I have to admit that this one has personality. The modern looks and the super friendly staff complements the food to make eating here a good experience
5
They claim to be 'the best crab experience in Singapore' and who am I to argue with them...friendly service, exceptional food and just great fun. The black pepper and red chilli crab were outstanding complete with obligatory steamed buns with which to mop up the delicious sauce. Already recommended it to two friends travelling this month, just go
5
At first glance, Momma Kong's may seem like another tourist trap set in the heart of Chinatown. However, unlike msg-laden giant seafood chains, this hole-in-the-wall serves a menu of hearty, authentic local dishes - a comprehensive mandatory meal for anyone setting foot on our sunny shores. Our generous dinner set for 2 was enough to feed 3 to 4 girls. The Crab Bee Hoon was a soupy delight while the Black Pepper Crab was coated in a perfect saucy paste that wasn't too runny or dry. While having a crack at crab-cracking, part of my shell went flying through the restaurant, which according to the waiter, happens fairly often. For those with less nimble digits, de-shelling services are available at $10. Dou Miou was a much-needed lightly-tossed filler between our Seared Scallops and never-ending crab bee hoon. The only problem we had was having to decide between the beckoning selection of crab dishes. All in all, it was a meal fit for a king. 
5
they fly in the crabs daily (ok not the most sustainable food model). however they have perfected the art of eating a crab. several exceptional singapore classics with and without the shell. pair this with fried and steamed buns. heaven. a must try. but book well in advance
4
My girlfriend and I just walked in, didn't know we needed a reservation...which we did. They very kindly created a table for us since most of the resos were for about an hour later. We ordered the chili crab and two steamed buns. The food came out quickly and was really tasty. The guys were quite attentive but then again there were four people in the whole place including U.S., so I can't comment on what it's like when busy. I'd probably give it 5/5 if not for price. We had just come from nearby Food Street where you can literally feast for about $15...for two. So to pay $50 for a crab and $15 for beers was a bit steep. There were other bars in the area though so maybe this was the going rate and I don't know how much crab in other parts of town cost, but it's hard to go from so cheap down the road for so pricey. I'd still go backThough!
5
Really enjoyed my dinner here! Prices per 100g are comparable with other mid-range reliable chains, and the crabs we had were fresh and their meat firm.Our favourites were the crab bee hoon soup and the fried mantou (we ordered the chilli crab just to get the sauce to dip the mantous in :p ).Note that their "set for two" is really a set for 3-4, unless you have a super large appetite. We shared three crabs between six people and only one side and it was enough food. Service was efficient and friendly even though they were obviously busy. Will be back for more of the crab bee hoon soup and to try the peranakan-style crab
3
Location is good as it close to Chinatown MRT station. It s small local restaurant but reservation will be good if you want to have dinner during weekend. They have two sessions at 6 30 pm and 8 00 pm. I went with friend and we ordered set meal with a bottle of wine. Food was okay but not special. But I liked the atmosphere of cozy air conditioned restaurant, specially when you order hot crab bee hoon soup. It would be better that they have a bigger table as dishes and plates were easily placed and they charge wet tissue while water bowl is not provided. Price is a bit expensive from overall food portion but from the atmosphere when you want to avoid busy, hot, loud place, this restaurant is recommended. Staffs were kind and nice.
5
I usually bring visiting friends to try our signature crab dishes (Chili,pepper, peranakan, etc). We really loved the Crab with noodle soup - comfort dish at its best! The set mean for 4 is very reasonably priced and comes with 3 crab dishes plus a whole load of sides. Very popular place so I recommend making reservations a week before

Wow... A tiny place in Chinatown but the food is bigger than expected, Crab is the deal here with Sri Lankan mud crab being served here.Singapore has a big name for dishes cooked with this crab. And here goes:Firstly, me and my wife went without any reservations which is a weekday as weekends we ever encounter full house and reservation only. Tried a set where you get 2 sides and 2 crabs. Based on our feeling, we decided to try a red chili and a butter crab.Butter crab: reminds me of the famous melbane butter crab which taste quite similar as the sauce is extremely unique taste with a thick base which could be a go or a no go as some people likes it either way. But have to say taste is really flavorful! Chilli. Crab : well, just feel that these is just one of the normal chilli crab you can find around but I would prefer a bit more egg to improve the texture of the sauce. All in all the taste is quite normal compared to jumbo( depending on chef ) or no signboard. Crab per say, I have to give a to the quality used and the price is average for crabs as it's not the cheaper ones as usually per kg sums up to $55-65.The side dou Miao or vegetable and grilled prawn was a let down though as I can't imagine the saltiness for both dish. A good side dish always compliment the crab. And to be serious on the crab and not serious on the sides really is a let down.Evaluation: worth a short for a local start up and I believe I will come again as the tiny place with rich thoughts on the food will entice me to come try other dishes next time. Cheer
5
This place is one of the best for crab in Singapore and a welcome alternative to the seafood chains. Located in the heart of China town on a street parallel to Pagoda Street. Nearest MRT either China Town China Point exit or Telok Ayer MRT.My personal favourite is the Butter crab and the black pepper carb is awesome. For those of you who love crab but find it difficult to extract the meat they have a deshelling service which means even a beginner can Savour the delights of delicious fresh sweet crab.Modern unfussy decor. Book a table in advance if you are trying to get a table on the weekends.
5
I eat Momma Kong's crab once a week and bring visitors here because they get to eat fantastic crab with air conditioning! Some say it's the best crab they have had, and they are coming from HK & Vancouver.Crab bee hoon, white pepper crab, and butter crab are my favorite dishes. You can pay $10 to have your crabs deshelled which is convenient. They also deliver

after reading the rave reviews, decided to give it a try on mother's day.Ordered butter and chili crabs and grilled squids. Both crabs were rather average and do take note, the chili crab sauce is pre-mixed so you are not able to opt for more/less spicy.Grilled squids - disappointed, tasteless and only taste of maybe olive oil.prices are competitive to Jumbo, No signboard etc @ 650g crab cost $48 and 1kg $68.Overall - not worth itP.S Nice thought of them to offer all mothers complimentary cupcake and ros

I was so looking forward to this dining experience! Especially after reading all the reviews. Our experience however was far from anything I had read... Perhaps it was just a bad night... Who knows? Chili Crab tasted OK would not rave about it. It is really the key thing I stay over in Singapore for so have had quite a few different experiences... This would be the wort and most expensive not sure I have ever paid $12.00 for tiger beer before or $13.00 for cider anywhere in Asia. However biggest disappointment was spending the whole next day totally incapacitated over the toilet bowl not being able to see anything I went for and then flying home ill and spending the following day in bed recovering! I can't recommend this one go to jumbos or red door... And don't eat the tofu chips blahhh even the thought of them still makes me queasy after 2 weeks. My biggest sadness is I may never be able to face Chili crab again :-

Located in Temple Street in the main tourist area, this place serves very good food in a simple but nice and clean environment, with excellent and friendly staff.I went with a party of two and asked a black pepper crab, a chilli crab, entrees and two glasses of wine and one beer. The food was very good, especially the chilli crab, highly recommended. They also served us some pastry called mantou, which is really highly recommended: it was absolutely gret with the chilli crab sauce, I would have eaten a ton of it!The 4 stars does not reflect any negativity, only that it is a simple (I repeat: simple but nice) place. It is rather small so going there without reservation is risky. Note that they take the last order at 10.30pm as the kitchen closes at 11pm sharp.The price was still pretty hefty, at 175$ for two. Obviously crabs do not come cheap, and Singapore also has become appalling expensive. But givn the whole experience, I did not come out of it dissatisfied and when I feel like having crab, I will definitively be back

Mommokong's crabs are really fresh and tasty. Had been here twice. The first time I tried chilli crab. I am not a fan of chilli crab but it is really nice! The second time I tried the set of 3 crabs - white pepper, butter and the crab bee hoon soup. all are superb! white pepper crab and butter crab is a little spicy. Try their pan-seared scallops too! Tofu fries are unique as well.

We litterly stumbled across momma kongs whilst desperately looking for somewhere to eat with our kids... And after a five day stay in Singapore, momma kings stands out as the best food, service and dinner experience we had.... I tried so hard to convince my wife to return... Definitely on our next trip to Singapore !!!! Do not miss momma kongs for the best chilli crab... Do it!!! But book ahead...

Make sure that you book a table in advance, the place is always fully book, it doesn't matter what day of the week is. I ordered a scallop as as started and the famous chili crap, both amazing. scallops were very tasty, perfectly cooked, but not over cooked and the seasoning was very nice, no killing the flavor of the scallops. The chili crap is the kind in this restaurant, a bit hot, but not enough not to allow you to test the crab, perfect combination of flavors and very tasty. The crab is enough for 2 people. The price is fair for Singapore. I will totally come back to this place in my next trip to Singapore.

Very well priced best tasting chilly crabs. Amazing flavour. If you looking for a place to eat famous Singaporian chilly crab - this is definitely the place to have this food experience.

We were highly excited about the prospect of eating here, however the scallops were burnt and the chilli crab proved too spicy and too soft, with no real flavour. Totally did not live up to the hype!
AVOID.

Not so fantastic the food, portion small and taste so so though price is not on high side. The seafood that we ordered like crab, prawn and scallop were not what we expected.

This was quite an interesting find in Chinatown. It is a small place so do book ahead. While not cheap, it is good value and the crabs are good. This place is willing to do smallish crab dishes so you can try all the flavours on offer if you have a big group. Compared to the big boys like Jumbo and Longbeach, this place is friendly and accommodating and cheaper! The staff were busy but efficient. The place was busy and we had a big group of 8 but all were happy with the meal. My vote for the chilly crab and crab beehoon

Located in China Town. A cafe-liked-Crab-Restaurant which can escape from the crowded traditional crab restaurant. Wonderful crabs meal with fixed price, it makes me feel secured and fair! The crabs are fresh and tasty! Staffs are nice. I will be back!Recommend : CRAB BEE HOON SOUP !! and the Steamed Mantou (super soft!).(I didnt try the chili crab this time coz my mom and I got sore throat the day before our visit.)Price: fair ( 2 crabs + 1 starter -- scallop + veggie + mantou + 2 drinks = SG$ 140+ ) with little marked up during Chinese new year stated before I order.PS: its easy to reserve a seat online

We stumbled across Momma Kong's in Chinatown after huge disappointment on the Quay. We were searching for good chili crab, but were rebuffed at the famous spots like Jumbo's for their sky-high prices and rather rude service. Tired and hangry, we wandered into Momma Kong's, and we couldn't have been happier. We of course ordered the chili crab, which was spicy and a good size, with the fried buns, which scooped up all the extra sauce and were crispy and delicious in their own right. The price was right, the service was friendly, and the atmosphere was hip. It wasn't terribly busy when we were there, but I bet that word will spread fast.Hail to the King Momma Kong

1st visit, I had the triple crabs offer. Crab beehoon and butter crab are one of the best! Recommended more friends over only this time we ordered side dishes. Bad move! The garlic prawn could have been better with the shell on, but while it's not, it taste really bland. Fried calamari looks like in their premature size. The portion & presentation really way under par their signature dishes. Crabs are much smaller than my 1st visit, but otherwise still taste amazing!

Skipped the Clarke Quay crowds on NYE and headed to Momma Kongs and in perfect time. Much of the dinner rush had passed. Ordered the chilli crab, fries, garlic prawns and calamari. All were fresh, hot and delicious. The chilli crab and steamed buns the star here. Along with a bucket of beer.A great last meal in 2014. Chilli crab in Singapore, see the guys at Mommas

I have tried most of the crab dishes from Momma Kong's and order takeout on a weekly basis. My favorite flavors are the butter crab and crab bee hoon. The seasonal white pepper crab is good too. I also like their side dishes: garlic prawns, Shanghai greens and bean sprouts.The restaurant is conveniently located in Chinatown on Mosque Street, which is close to Club Street (in case you fancy drinks after dinner).Kid-friendly. My relatives were visiting from Hong Kong and were impressed to find a baby changing table in the bathroom! How convenient. The restaurant also has high chairs for babies

Came here for the crab dishes that everyone was raving about. Left absolutely delighted with the fact that I was finally able to eat fried-rice and other seafood dishes that in other restaurants are simply made in concrete: no changes or substitutions. Instead waiters and even the chef explained ingredients in the dishes upon questioning, agreeing to take out soy sauce and even flour in some of the fried dishes to accommodate my intolerance. I would definitely suggest this place for those with food concerns or allergies

We enjoyed the Crab dinner. Fresh and spicy, but the service was terrible. It seemed that they were happier talking to each other than serving clients. No need to go back again

This is definitely the place to go for crab lover if you do not prefer the usual seafood restaurant.

First visit to Momma Kong's and was greatly satisfied with the food and service. Price of crab is very reasonable and really yummy.
If you want a fresh experience in crab feast, you must pay a visit to Momma Kong's Crab Shack.

yummy seafood , with great pepper and chilly crab and tofu chips. It is small and quirky, good for a relaxed meal with friends.

Great selection of crab dishes in a fun trendy place, but very small so booking is a must and kitchen closes quite early.
Our black pepper crab was delicious in particular, but the other dishes that we shared were also very satisfying.

Laid back casual place with a great variety of crab dishes ... And for a small extra fee they will even de-shell them for you. A small place so would recommend a reservation or get there early!

We booked in here ahead of time after searching the internet and finding out you could pay extra to have the crab de-shelled. BONUS!! I hate de-shelling.We arrived early for our booking, but they happily seated us. Not long after, the restaurant was full.Undecided, we opted for 3 crabs (between 2 of us). Red Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Butter Crab. With a side of greeen vegies. The waiter recommended we also get the steamed and fried buns. As the meals arrived, we were able to sit back and eat the crab without having to de-shell. Dipping the buns in the sauce to get a hit of flavour.I think we did well to clear most of the crab. De-shelling is $10 extra per crab (Oct-2014) but well worth it in my opinion.I would come back here on my next visit

It's a nice alternative from the usual seafood/tzechar place - to get your fingers all messy eating crabs in a slightly more "restaurant" kind of environment. And without having to pay much more.We tried the Crab noodle soup and the Black pepper crab. The soup was creamy and full of crab flavour. The crab in the soup was a female one, so there was lots of rich bits of roe in the soup, making it even more yummy. But too much of a good thing may not be good, as we told the restaurant manager after the meal. They should have asked us whether we wanted a female crab (with roe) or a male one (more meaty, without roe) and we would have opted for one each. As it turned out, we were served 2 crabs with loads of roe. Some people would have rejoiced, but we thought it was a tad too rich.No complaints about the taste and the quality of the cooking though. Both dishes were delicious. The black pepper one may be a bit too spicy hot for some. We didn't try the ubiquitous Singapore dish - the chilli crab - so cannot offer any comments.The side dishes - Tofu chips were unusual, but quite nice - crisp outside and soft inside - but they could have served it with a better freshly made chilli dip instead of the bottled chilli sauce. The grilled squid with some salsa topping was just so-so.Overall, a rather enjoyable meal. I look forward to coming back to try the other crab dishes

I've heard how great crab is in Singapore, but this crab shack exceeded expectations. I ordered the red chilli crab, praying it wasn't too spicy, and it wasn't. It had a perfect chilli/slightly tomato red sauce which was thick and made with the egg of the crab. The crab itself was succulent and fresh. My bf ordered the butter crab which was too buttery and creamy. The atmosphere was great for eating crab - a street away from crowds walking past so you could enjoy and not worry about making a mess in front of people walking past!! the restaurant was clean. The service was only average however, drinks and service took ages, but the food came out quick. Would've loved to have tried the seared scallops but they ran out so we settled for calamari which was pretty nice too.

Momma Kong√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Crab Shack is a great place to relax (screens live football outdoors) and feast on delicious crabs and booze (happy hours are from 5-7 pm). The greatest draw of this place is definitely the standard price of $38 for 650g of Sri Lankan mud crab (sufficient for 2 persons) or $110 for any 3 crabs (cooked in different style) compared to the typical chinese restaurant which usually just list it as seasonal price. So you won't get a shock when the bill come! Need i say more about the crabs? They are succulent, tender and come out in whole chunks! One of my kept secret for good crabs in Singapore
