food was great, al dente, view was spectacular as my son loved the ceiling to floor windows. staff was attentive
5
a nice place to spend a weekend brunch at. family friendly and staff are also nice too. definitely will head back as their food is pretty decent for their price
4
1st visit to restaurant with free parking but limited slots, good environment with live band and good service. Bought Chope vouchers for 10% discount.
4
Reasonably priced considering the portion was generous, food was quite good and the staff were attentive.
3
We decided to come back to Soruce to celebrate our wedding anniversary. As we had a good time last October 2017 when I treated my Husband for his breakfast bday. But there are not much of staffs running the place. We have to wave our hands to order our food and seems the server is quite tied up. Even forgot to serve my daughter’s ice cream and I have to call another staff to remind them of it. The food was superb. The atmosphere is good. All in all, our celebration was a mediocre experience.
2
The place was pretty empty but yet the customer service was not up to standards. I've been to this place before a few years back and had great experience but not this time. Wasn't served iced water when we first arrive. Raised my hands really long several time before someone attend to me. The chicken that I ordered was sooooo dry??
4
generous portions and good tasting. slightly irritated about the al fresco area due to cigarette smoke. otherwise, sit indoors and you will be ok. live band was good as wel
4
Great dining place. Great place to bring your dates too. Great menu, tasty food, didn’t have to wait massively long for your food to come.Wish the servers could be a little more attentive though (esp if you’re seated at the corner).Love that there’s free parking. Acoustic Band is decent if you enjoy live music. Try the spicy chicken wings - my mouth is watering again just by thinking about it
4
Nice and friendly waiters. Place is relaxing and environment is bright and clean. Food wise is average. The menu could be improved, as it has not changed or enhanced in years
5
Nice food nice location.nice quiet family ambiance.It was raining cats and dogs thought so shelter can be provided along the sides from the carpark to the restaurant though
4
.NIce and cozy place for gathering for any occasion. Food is good. Easy parking spaces. will visit this place again.
5
Service crews are friendly. The food quality are pretty good. There’s also live band performance. A recommended hangout with friends and family.
5
2 brunch-popular cocktail for $20. or prosecco $8 with each order. chicken and waffles, Mac not cheese
4
Food and ambience of restaurant was good. The acoustic band that night sang a nice mix of English and chinese pop songs.
3
Nice place to dine and parking is free.
Food was average but service is just so-so.
Price is higher than normal.
Unlikely I will be back again.
4
A very good place to chill and relax, free parking space available for those who drive, which is an extra bonus. Ambience was good, with a huge tv screen for soccer fans, and also live band performance. Highly recommended for a gathering or meals with friends!
4
Good ambience with friends and helpful staffs. Food is not bad but price is average restaurant pricing
3
Service was average. Food is not bad but overpriced in my opinion. Nice environment for a quiet weekend brunch
2
Attentive service in a chill out cafe ambience. Salad is generously portioned, delicious and tastes fresh. Disappointed with the risotto which tasted like it was precooked and reheated on order, where the sauce had separated and risotto overdone. Lemonade tastes weird, too sour and sweet.
3
Staying with an old friend living nearby as I was tired having flown in from KL. Although we were both born in Australia my friend has lived in this part of SE Asia for 25 years and myself only sixteen! The waiter that took our meal and drinks orders spoke to us like we were tourists which was almost amusing to start with but continued through the evening. My beef satay was quite good they had run out of chicken so I tried the wings with a lime dressing which were not the delicate size I was expecting and the dressing was overwhelming and not finished. She has a burger which was cooked just the way she liked it. I would suggest you work on your service it was haphazard and an underwhelming
5
Very attentive staff who are observant and on the ball. The food we ordered was also filling and scrumptious. Would love to come back soon!
4
The location is very nice, although the food can be abit pricey, especially the desserts! Quality of the food is great though, tastes great, great presentation and excellent service.
5
There was an event that evening and we could only get an outdoor table. The dinner would have been more enjoyable if we can have a cooling night.
3
If you are looking for "traditional" & university campus flavour, this is the place to go... wish they are more generous with the food portion, not that "value for money" experience...
5
Superbly tasty food, spacious interior, attentive staff, relaxed & quiet atmosphere
Food was better than at most cafes, although the chocolate lava cake could have been warmer so that the interior is more gooey. Excellent coffee.
5
Service is excellent. Prompt and attentive. Always smiling! Food as usual is fantastic. Will be back for more!
4
Nice ambience and friendly staff. Food is good but slightly pricey. Nice ambience and pet friendly (outdoor seating area)
4
Nice ambience and food is nice. Staff is friendly and really love the flat white coffee. I would return again to visit this cafe. It has a bouncy castle for kids to play too.
4
I LIKE THIS PLACE. My first time here - housed in a forner fire station and tucked closer to Upper Bukit Timah, this place checks all the hipster boxes. High ceilings, loads of brown, nice and cosy. Food was good or at least we enjoyed whatever we ordered - the big breakfast and the triple deck cheese sandwich. The folks next to us were enjoying their pancakes with a plate of chicken wings (i heard oohs and ahhs - seems they are known for their wings, will try next time). Service was attentive and best of all, the Spruce guys leave out a tall container of cold water at the pedestrian walkway in front of their place as a drink stop for joggers, cyclists and even pets. Consideration like that deserves a round clapclapclap. Good going Spruce. Be seeing you more soon
4
Good place for a lunch meeting if one is in the area. Steak frites was nice and hit the spot for a business lunch. Unfortunately they JAD run out of foie gras which would have topped it off even better. Not crowded, so easy to talk.
4
Everyone was delighted with the atomsphere and the food served were delicious.
Wander for boys whom are growning as portion is great
5
First time at the fire station branch. Good alternative to Phoenix park.
Service was quick and fast. Ali provided off menu items.
2
foods were served wrongly as what we ordered. server doesnt bother to apologise and change. foods were cold when serve. overall experience was bad
3
I've made a booking but upon arrival I still have to wait for the tables to be cleared. Staffs were slow even though it wasn't that crowded but food was served fast.
3
Most dishes are value for money because they are good for two. Average food and average interiors - there are much better options in the city
4
love the ambience. Live band was pretty so-so. Nothing fantastic.
Service wise not too bad. Cant complaint as the place was pretty packed.
Indoor and outdoor seems so cosy enough to chillout. Food was okie, nothing on the menu 'WOW' me.
4
Had a good meal at Spruce. Easy to travel there and nice ambience at the old fire station! Will be back again!
4
Went there for my mother's birthday celebration, the food was good as usual (Sunday brunch) but the waiting time was a little long and it was a little difficult to get the servers' attention. Great that they gave a complimentary cake for my mum's birthday though!
4
Cosy place with attentive service. The happy hour prices are pretty affordable although it would have been better if there could be more wine choices. The al fresco dining area can be pretty smelly though when it is filled with smokers and right smacked in between the indoor dining and parking area. Not such a good dining place for young children when there is live soccer broadcast..
4
Visited Spruce with family.The restaurant is located in what was previously a fire station.Great food - try the Crab Cake Benny, Spruce British Brekkie hot cakes or even the Spruce Eggs Benny.Good coffee to go with the food.Plenty of greenery around and you can sit outside with your pets if you like - not commonly available.Lovely ambience in rustic environment near Bukit Timah Hill.Service staff polite and helpful - a big plus.Worth a visit if you are looking to try something different
3
We were not really satisfied with food, especially Clam Chowder, it was really bland, no flavour of seafood, just like a thick soup with thron in a few clams & uncooked potatoes
4
The food tastes great, and the staff are very friendly. The atmosphere is nice both inside and outside.
3
please remember remind them dont bring all the food in the same time, appetizers and main course together.
5
Have been here for gathering a few times.
Food & service is good.
Recommend for both casual and business dining.
3
The food was too mediocre. Bacon was too hard whule the poached eggs were cold when served. Overall, a bit disappointing
3
It is a rather nice and tasty brunch which is very filling. However the bacon was slightly burnt and overcooked.
5
Love the ambient. Food was better than expected. Ample parking space just outside the restaurant and alfresco area is available too
4
Nice atmosphere to chill, food is great, friendly service and most important; pet friendly. Me and my poodle dine alfresco style
3
I drive past this place frequently and it looked like a nice restaurant. So de used to have breakfast there as it's a bakery as well. The restaurant is housed in a former fire station and it's quite a nice setting with the Bukit Timah nature reserve near by. Staff are friendly and they serve English breakfast with the full works as well as other options. Food was served quite quickly but unfortunately the food looks far better than it taste. Scrambled eggs looked like plastic and tasted really bland. Sausages and ham are over cooked. So pretty disappointing really. Breakfast for 2 cost about $60! Pretty pricey! Don't think I'll be back
5
I went to Spruce to celebrate my son's 3 yr old bday. It was a wonderful dinner we had as 1 big extended family. Had my parents and in laws together with the siblings at the dinner. The location, the service, the food and ambience is perfect. My family enjoyed the dinner greatly too.
4
A very nice place for family while enjoying beer and live band. Food was fantastic and service is good.
4
Ambience was good. The supervisor was nice and flexible and staff and service was great. Food was so so but drinks were ok. Band was soft, sang strange music and not up to standard
5
This was my third visit to the restaurant. Still as delicious and staffs are friendly. Enjoyed my visits!
4
A nice place in the west of Singapore to chill with friends over some wine or beer. The cheese nachos were really delicious, great to go with beer. The burgers and buffalo wings were fine companions too.
5
Since one year before, still very nice place now add on darts, server also very kind friendly, happy hour time enjoy, view good. Spruce Brownies cheesecake delicious
4
The foie gras add-on was seared till crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. Perfect! The eggs benny were cooked well but needed to be more generous with sauce. Ask for a table away from the kitchen door. Very unpleasant to have hot air blasting throughout the meal every time the door opens. I liked the free parking
3
Went here after hiking from Bt Timah, and the ambience of the cafe is good to catch up with friends. We had the banana hotcakes, which is an absolute disappoinment for my love for hotcakes, and the big breakfast is mediocre at best. The flat white was weak. The staff was great though
4
Spent an evening dinner at Spruce. First time going back there after a long time. The service staff were friendly, warm, personal and truly made us feel comfortable. We had ordered one soup to share and the service staff was quick to offer to split the soup into two bowls for us. I appreciate the conscientiousness of the service staff to ease our dining experience. The 48 hour slow cooked short rib was succulent, tender and well prepared. The only disappointment was the taste of the mushroom soup which was bland and the foie gras which was served relatively cold on the plate. However, overall I had a smile filled experience thanks to the super duper service staff of Spruce Bukit Tima
3
Went there for brunch on Wednesday and ordered salad breakfast that come with toast, salad, 2 poached egg. Portion good for 1 and the taste ordinary....nothing to wow about. The next dish- pulled pork was salty and the wafer was tasteless and soggy. It does not have a fresh baked aroma. The kid menu of macaroni with cheese looked so uninteresting nor appetizing as the plate is white, the ingredient is also white and salty. The Nacho cheese - the chips are crispy but the cheese is also a failure, the cheese is lumpy. The soups are also a great disappointment - mushroom and Boston clam chowder - they are not piping hot as requested. The texture of the soup is meant for baby as they are puree. the croutons are not fresh - one bite the exterior is a bit crisp but the centre is soggy - a sign that it was either prepared some times back if they cooked themselves, or perhaps they did not put them in airtight container if they brought them commercially. The belachan chilly that accompany the devil chicken wings are raw in taste and salty. The 2 good items that are decent would be the chicken wings and the french fries. Total bill over S$170. It was rather noisy and making conversation was rather annoying
3
The old spruce was in Phoenix park, in a nice tropical environment. The new spruce is on the edge of a massive road and the outdoor space directly faces the car park.The place has been turned into an American sport bar and the decoration is pretty terrible.Food is average, slightly above a typical bar food but definitely nothing memorable.I believe there are way more interesting dining options in Dempsey hill if you want to stay in this vicinity, than this uninspired average restaurant
4
perfect venue for a brunch/breakfast with family and friends. banana pancakes are a popular choice here, other brekkie and brunch menu items are good as well.
3
Have eaten better egg benedicts elsewhere. Service was not too bad, nice atmosphere for a lazy sunday morning. However, quite out of the way so not worth travelling all the way.
4
Had the Big Brekkie. Awesome quantity, even though the sausage was a little on the salty side. Nevertheless, it was a quiet sunday brunch.
3
Food was average for average price. Was slightly disappointed by the ambience of the place and live music. Seated outside but was not informed beforehand that it might be smoking area. Nevertheless, service was good. Recommended for a once-off visit.
5
Love the way all service staffs being attentive and helpful with good sense of humor making weekend dining even more awesome! Thank you!
4
A quiet and relaxing place for good food and audible conversations. The free parking and convenient location for those living /working around Bukit Timah is a bonus.
4
Had their prawn pasta under the 1-1 lunch set, was tasty and they were accommodating enough to change it to aglio olio for my mum who did not like cream pastas!
4
Excellent place. Service good. Thumb up. Will definitely go back again. Only location quite inconvenient
4
popped by the place for lunch due to close proximity to the next destination n care free parking. There were lunch promotion which can make the lunch very attractively priced. But I went for Steak instead. Serving was reasonably big. Both of us didn't manage to clear our extra spicy wings ordered on top of our main course. The steak was juicy enÃ²ugh though it was not quite my type of medium rare. But it was still alright. The wings spicy enough for our liking. Service was good since we are the only few diners there. Place was nice n quite. There were live band in the evening on weekday
2
Visited Spruce with my hubby on a Fri night. Let me start with the good points. There live music being played by a great couple, the ambience was relaxed and cozy, there were some games like darts, etc for families. So there was something for everyone. The food we ordered was ok. My hubby ordered the Spruce burger and I had the chicken burger which was supposed to be spicy but I found it a bit bland. We also ordered the Home made Lemon juice with Mint and Raspberry Ice tea which was great. But the service was sooo lousy! We had to wait around for 5-10 mins before being attended to! We were just waiting for someone to look at us so we could call them over to order! Shouldn't it be the other way around?!? Anyway, it gets better, once we were done we waited for what seemed like forever for the tables to cleared and my hubby wanted to order dessert. Finally a staff looks towards us and we tell him we are done and to get someone to clear up and he calls out to another guy to do the needful, but the other guy was busy with something else so there was some confusion and guess what?!? We were waiting for another 10-15 mins before we AGAIN asked for someone to come over. My hubby was obviously pissed by then and decided to forego dessert just wanted to pay the bill and leave! Funny thing is when we came in the place was "somewhat" busy but after we finished dinner the place was just about half full! So it was not like the staff were busy rushing about because of a full house. Really dissapointing service
5
Second time I've visited the restaurant. It has pretty good ambience and its staffs are very friendly. Highly recommended and would visit again.
4
It was pretty quite on a early Saturday morning. Service was good. Food was fast. On the pricey side.
Beef burger with fries $20++
Egg Benny $15++
British brekkie $19++
Big brekkie $19++
Earl grey / cafe latte / cappuccino $6++ each
4
Crab Cake Benny was nice, probably a little too little for its portion. But the sunday brunch ambience was perfect for my girlfriend and I.
5
The ambience of the place was very nice. Giving people a very comfortable feel. The service staff were great and u really can't ask for more. Food was also excellent .
3
Ambience is good but price is slightly above average. Definitely need a car to come here. Good thing is the free parking for customer.
5
Dinner was serve fast despite the long Q. Got my seats shortly. Food is good.
A rose was given to my wife for Vday :)
4
Happened to come across this fire station converted to restuarant / bakery while walking the mount bukit timah trail. It was for a quick coffee and a bite which became a downpour of orders for a early dinner. The food at your table good and that of others was too tempting. Need to go there once more. Do not miss this place if in that vicinity
3
The place has a nice ambience with cool interior designs to chill and wind down with friends after a long day at work. However, there can be improvements in the cleanliness of the place and possibly also the comfort of the tables n chairs. The food tastes good, especially the chicken wings, but they are a tad too pricey. Overall, it was a good experience for me.
4
Only two other tables were occupied when we went at 9:15a.m. but was pretty well occupied by the time we left an hour later. I had the Beef-up Benny and hubby had the Spruce Eggs Benny. Both plates were of good portions and the eggs were perfectly done. Hubs' plate was a little delayed as they had problems with the waffle iron which they came to explain and sent over a complimentary cup of latte. Total bill came close to $60. Not crazy expensive but not somewhere we would frequent too often based on the price range. The coffee cups are on the small side. Two sips and it's gone. At $6, though somewhat common in such outlets, it's still an extravagance.
4
This place used to be a fire station. It was converted to a restaurant and several enrichment schools nearby. We have Pulled Beef Benny, Banana Hotcakes and Brit Brekkie, which is similar to a full American breakfast. The pulled beef benny comes with 2 poached eggs which was nicely done. The egg yoke flows like golden lava. The banana hot cakes are sweet and savoury, although I find that a tad too much maple syrup was out in top of the hotcakes. Nice place for a lazy Sunday brunch.
5
Service was prompt and staff were friendly. The food was within expectations as it was not my first time.
4
Some dishes are very good, especially their white wine sauce seabass, I would come back there just for this. Staff is warm and nice
5
My fiancé and I have been coming here for years and were once again amazed by their service & food. Special thanks to the awesome Jerry who made our experience extra special & unique. The live band was great too!
4
The food's here pretty good? Especially their specialty orreciette pasta with prawns. Great that they have a $10 for 2 drinks happy hour promo as well!
5
There's both indoor and outdoor seatings whichever you prefer and friendly staff as welll! Nice place to just wind down your busy week
5
Didn't manage to catch sight of the monkeys this time round being slightly later part of the morning, but nice environment and atmosphere. Very attentive and friendly service.
5
I go to Spruce almost weekly. Nice ambience, good service, reasonable prices and adequate parking spaces.
2
Not enough seats and tables during the dinner peak hrs. Waitress took down orders and only infd us 0.5hours later that the order phone hang so need to redo our order. Waited another 30 mins for food to be served. The experience would be so much better if there was better customer management during peak hour
5
Celebrated our mom's bday at the restaurant today and is pleasantly surprised by the service. Food tasted really good. Steak is cooked just right, pasta and ribs were really tasty too! Perfect place for family dinner. Ambience is really good too. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
1
Came for a lunch with my girlfriend and her brother, from the start service was poor, we asked to order to 3 different people before someone came over about 5 minutes later to take the order, when the food came it was "ok" but compared to other western restaurants well below average, also the food came minus cutlery and napkins which we had to source for ourself from other tables.They also appeared to be having issues clearing up as various tables were left uncleared and the bar in the middle was cluttered with dirty dishes.We ordered some truffle fries on the side, but it came minus the truffle oil! When we requested it the waiter added it and made a show of wafting the truffle aroma towards my girlfriend.Also the couple next to us had an issue where the burger they ordered came without cheese, when the food returned the cheese had miraculously appeared and the staff insisted it had been there all along
4
The staff was really nice in making the roasted pork salad and added complimentary goat cheese when I mentioned I came for the signature salad (with goat cheese). Sassy wings are awesome.
3
Good ambience for friends meetup and couples, but slightly costly. Best to go when there is live music.
4
A very nice place for chat and chill out with friends alfresco style. Only thing is the ants that came to visit our table. Food was good too!
5
Had dinner on Monday. Not too crowded, food (pulled pork burger) was tasty. Herbed handout fries were also good. Service was friendly and attentive.
5
Great place to mingle with friends and family. The high ceiling of the restaurant (fire station) created a spacious and relaxing venue to unwind. The staff were so attentive to all our needs.
5
1 for 1 on 2 champagne cocktails among others. real strong brewed ice tea without the sugar nor lemon already added. Nutella cheesecake!
3
If you like live music, this is a nice place to go. Food is fine, American style. Nothing special, but nice.
4
The ambience at the Firestation was unique and comfortable. Did not have to wait to be seated. Food was reasonably good although it seemed slightly overpriced
5
Been there for dinner with a friend and that the staffs were very kind that they immediately attend to our orders for plain waters, following by the food and all. The food was delicious.The staffs kept checking up on my friend and I, and they were really friendly to us too! Thanks!
5
My friends and I went in the afternoon and there was no crowd. The food was beyond great. Highly recommend the Truffle Mushroom Risotto for a main dish. My friend ate a beef burger with blue cheese which had one of the juiciest beef patty she had ever ate.(according to her) Dessert just blew us away. No words can describe. They're service was good. The location is a little hard to get to but you wouldn't be able to miss the building. There's a bus stop near the restaurant. Definitely will come again. Thank you Spruce for the awesome food
4
Food was good. Drink was ok. Environment was comfortable. Manager Mohan was very nice and served us with a little extra, which really mean good service. Also saw 3 groups celebrating their friend birthday with a cake slice and song from the restaurant.
5
The blue cheese burger and the chrunchy chocolate cake with ice cream and berries doesn't get any better then this. Add the cozy location and nice live music performance (yes...) and a tio rating is well deserved.
3
Had lunch here. There is no set lunch menu and food is very expensive for the area. You are paying 20 dollars plus for most of the main courses. That said food taste was good. Service was ok although staff could smile a little more.
3
Food tasted average or a little bland and prices were on the high side given the taste. Have had better brunch elsewhere.
5
The food was delicious. Had blue cheese beef burger. Beef was moist and tender. The menu did not have some of the items that we read about online though.
4
I enjoyed a saturday afternoon at spruce chatting with my friends over coffee and pancakes. Thought the food was ok, coffee was good, and the place was really good for chilling.
3
Nothing stands at this place, perhaps the unique location, but it felt like they were squandering the potential of the place. Prices are too steep for this area.
3
Waited for a while before i gave this review. Had to try this place out a few times. The place is a converted old fire station, so the environment is actually quite nice, high ceiling, spacious and all. Outdoor seating too. Atmosphere a plus. But with any f&b establishment, the food and drinks play a big part. Breakfast was just normal, not great, nothing that impresses, not even service. Lunch and dinner was something else, better service, probably a different crew, the food is better too. So if you have decided to check this place out, come during lunch or dinner. You probably can find better breakfast elsewhere
4
Reservation on Saturday and there was enough people to fill the cosy place. Restaurant by the road allow some sunlight to come through and yet cool in the inside to enjoy a lazy brunch. Interaction from severs with many patrons can be seen. The friendliness and prompt recommendations and request was well met.
4
We were running from Bukit Timah to Bukit Batok reserves when we passed by your establishment and noticed you guys serving water to joggers, runners and cyclists! Just want to thank you guys, friend n I will drop by when we were not all that sweaty from our run
4
Food was good with friendly staffs. However the air con probably needs some servicing, making the whole restaurant slightly stuffy.
4
Food and service was good, but the sounds in the indoor dining area will get enclosed and become noise to other ends of of the place.
5
The people there were really polite and the atmosphere was really good. A great place to chill out with friends.
5
Everything is very good, fantastic hamburgers, French fries, eggs Benedict...friendly service! Fresh ingredients...
3
The place has free parking right at the door step. Which make it easy for people bringing their kids and elderly parents. The place is quiet and the breakfast portion is reasonable.
4
Great food, especially their pancakes, but rather expensive for a breakfast! Over priced so not a place we'll go often.
5
Location was quite unique i could say. Friendly staff, good ambience , acceptable range of beverages , good food and most importantly excellent service 👍🏻.
4
The location's pretty interesting and the food good but I find this place rather unremarkable, I'm unsure why, probably because it's rather pricey for its locale. I would still come around again but it's not amongst my favourite places
1
The place was hot and humid although its was air-con area. Foods was overrated, order a hot chicken burger, the chicken paddies was hard to chew or cut. Had highlight it to their Manager but he seem can't be bother.Didn't finish the meal and went off because its was too stuffy
4
Love the way that customers are genuinely and warmly greeted - keep it up. It's terrific too that you have live music, but honestly it smashes any chance of conversation. Turn the volume down and keep the song list and you will have the perfect mix. The food is always good, to very good, but far too expensive for a suburban restaurant.
5
Perfect ambience. Reservations done right. Convenient and free parking. Excellent service. Not too warm. Smoking tables available.
3
Nice coffee, spacious, friendly staff and cool ambience. Food choice is limited and standard - nothing great.
4
Quiet but not secluded, tables were arranged well and the bar was in the middle so the restaurant was spacious
Service was great and accommodating
Food was good
3
The coffee (mocha) was good, but food was average and pretty expensive. We had 2 breakfasts and 2 drinks and it turned out to be $70.
2
Food taste bad especially Sea Bsss which is too bitter due to the excessive spice usage.
Spruce Burger which is recommended in other webpage is not as good as expected. Beef to 'dry' (not) juicy.
4
Spruce provides really yummy food, coupled with a nice selection of beers. Asahi Dry and Asahi Black are available on tap, the meats were well seasoned and cooked.
5
At first, the impression wasn't as good as the staff seemed to be way too busy clearing up tables and serving food and we had a hard time getting attention for our order.However, when I finally got the attention of one of the staff, who seemed to be one of the managers overseeing the place, my perception changed. He was friendly, amiable, fun and helpful. He gave recommendations of what's good and gave his personal reviews about the drinks/dishes for us too. Even photobombed our picture :D hahahaha!The music by the band (an acoustic duo) was good but it's sad where they were located. The placement could have been better but I believe the band was an addition to the restaurant's original set up thus space wasn't catered to them initially - still something they can consider improving (:
1
I ordered the Jamon and beef short rib. Halfway through the Jamon, I considered cancelling the beef, I wish I had.Jamon has tasteless, not sliced well, more hacked. Cheese was below average. Stale bread toasted so that you can't tell it is not fresh. Four big chunks of solid butter than you cannot slice.Beef short rib came with half an egg, most the of the white was missing. Spinach and mushrooms slimy. Potatoes were not crispy. Beef was cold.First glass of red wine was too cold. Second glass too warm (although better than the first).When I paid, I asked the server if the food was usually this bad and she said yes. I asked again to make sure.It is a real shame as this is an excellent location. Maybe eat at home or elsewhere and visit just for drinks
3
We went to have dinner. Greeting at the entrance was warm. Service needs improvement. While taking away my signed credit card slip the service staff was talking to someone at the next table. Should be more attentive to one table at a time. Food was average
5
The manager suggested that we ordered their special of the day (CÃ´te de boeuf) which came with salad and fries. It was a great suggestion as the beef was very tender and great value for money.There is live music on friday and during the weekends and it gets a little loud inside the cafe. Would be better to sit outdoors if you want have a conversation with your dinner companion
5
We had crab cake benny it was nice and good! Staff was friendly and helpful....they serve us ice water the moment we sat down..good initiative!!
4
Fantastic hot wings, great salad and a very good piece of Steak , only slight too done instead of rare .
3
The service staff was polite but was too busy to attend to my table most of the time. I think they are really short handed. I requested for water to be served but it never came even after three reminders. Paying also took time.
4
Lovely live band. Good for chilling and listening to music. Tried fruit beer and a piece of cake. Delicious!
5
This place is right on Bukit Timah road. So the access by public transport is quite good. They have extensive parking in the back. The staff was very friendly and they have good drinks at affordable prices.
4
Service crew was attentive and sweet, made a little cup of steamed milk for my restless toddler. Food was in big portion and delicious!
3
Poor location on the main road and you sit outside in the car park. Food was quite good, service attentive but probably wouldn't go back.
5
Been wanting to visit and finally got a chance with easy reservation on Chope. Service is great. We were led to our seat promptly. My son was not used to the cheese taste and I tried to sniff if the cheese was too strong for him, one of the service crews saw what I was doing and came over to ask if everything is alright. I am impressed with the attentiveness of the service crew.Food is good. I am never a fan of rocket leaves salad and black pepper type of food. The combination of the steak benny with black pepper hollandaise sauce gave me a new experience of having rocket leaves and black pepper in my meal. I like the dish and the steak is done just right for me

I ordered the Spruce Brekkie. The potato slice is over fried and soggy. The wiener is inedible for me maybe because it's preserved with nitrite. Should have known about most sausages. The poached eggs were done alright with the expected runny yolk. Food was served slightly colder than usual. Feels like it was left on the counter for a few minutes.No one asked how we thought of the food. Diners were banging their chairs against each other without regard of personal space. Hence seating is a little tight. Opt for a table at the perimeter of the space if anyone is considering visiting.Sorry not coming back.

We ordered 3 meals. The waitress gave us 2 meals and never returned for the third one.After a long wait and a conversation with the manager, the third meal came. They didn't realise that the first two ones were already cold.. Again, a conversation with the manager. After a 30 minutes waiting in total we finally could start with the meal..

This visit I tried the Spruce Burger and it lives up to its signature title - add bacon and egg. Delicious and tender patty. The truffles fries and wings are average.
Have yet to try more.
4
A first for my family. Food was above average, beers were good.
Service staff friendly and approachable.
Overall, very enjoyable.
4
Try the mushroom risotto - it was so lovely! The duo who were singing and taking requests were great also.
4
The waiter got my orders wrong but was willing to make a new order for me.
Awesome! The area was quiet and nice =)

Visited Spruce (Fire Station) yesterday for the first time with my family. Overall, the food is great and the atmosphere is pretty good for brunch. My family and I had enjoyed the visit.

Made a trip all the way from the east after hearing friend’s recommendation. Placed a reservation via Chope & even bought their 10% discount vouchers.Parking at the former fire station was already almost full capacity for a Friday night, but we still managed to squeeze into a corner lot.The service staff were prompt and friendly, however the live band & subsequent piped in music was more suited for pub atmosphere. Unfortunately a little too loud for a family sit down dinner.Ordered their soup of the day ... it was supposed to be mushroom soup, but ended up being served some diluted potato based soup, which was not worth the $14 we paid for.The foie gras was nice and so was the salad we ordered.We were recommended their special for the week - 1.2 kg steak on a rib, which set us back abt $128++. We ordered medium but it came out pretty well done. Wasted effort.Overall, food & surrounding left us disappointed. Price is not cheap. Perhaps we were wrong to expect otherwise. Don’t think there’s anything that’ll bring us back a second time

Tucked away in an unexpected corner where it used to be a firestation. Service was busy but still quite attentive, service staff tried their best to ensure all customers were taken cared of in spite of the full house. Ordered their signature salad, but the goat cheese was too strong tasting, almost couldnt swallow anything in the bowl. The foie gras was also super 'stinky', the taste was far different from the foie gras i used to have. Either they cooked lamb with the same pan or the foie gras is actually duck liver instead of goose which they claim it was. Overall, new experience but probably wont go back again
4
Service was not bad, though not fantastic. We ordered 3 mains and a side to share. Food was nice, especially the crab cake eggs benedict. Mac and cheese as the side was so-so, I remember it being very awesome when I ate it 2 years ago (it had other toppings). We also ordered the 1-1 lychee martini, which I enjoyed. Overall, satisfied tummy
5
I booked a table for 23 people for my daughter's birthday dinner last night. The service was smooth and efficient. Mohan and his team was attentive throughout and we didn't have to wait long for food despite the size of the group.Food was delicious and the ambience was cosy.My daughter and friends had a blast and so did the adults.It was a positive experience for us and we highly recommend this place.So, thank you again Mohan, Nini and team

Today, I made a reservation through an app for my wife's girls night out with her friend here but she was terribly disappointed with the service of a particular wait staff. Here is her reiteration. "This is one of my favourite restaurant I frequent as I was living in the area before. Today I went back but was severely displeased. The food and drinks were good and served on time. And a waiter was kind enough to hold our bubbly and wine even though happy hour was over. Halfway through conversation, we were rudely interrupted by a new malay waiter who paused midway to look at the band while clearing our table. He then incoherently asked about our second round of drinks. My friend politely told him that she has a prosecco and was ready for her second glass. He was frowning and said, "so you all had 4 drinks la? Order 1 more prosecco." I explained that there are 2 on hold and we are ready. He then responded loudly with, "YA LA!! Then means you had 4 la!" I snapped and pointed at our glasses, "look, we have 2 here and 2 on hold. Please serve the other 2." He left without a word. Later, we called for the bill but there was an error so it had to be reprinted. No worries there. My girlfriend and I decided to take a selfie but again was rudely intercepted by said waiter who thrusted the bill folder in between us. No thank you no smiles nothing. Less to say, no tips. I would return to Spruce but if this isn't addressed, I'd highly reconsider my future visits."

Food was very good. But service was slow due to lack of staff. But they were friendly. They also ran out of freshly squeezed juice
4
despite having a shortage in staff they delivered on time and provided us with a sumptuous meal, a way to go...
4
We had steak eggs Ben and a Deluxe brekkie set.
The steak eggs Ben was interesting and went well - nice concept.
Brekkie was disappointing, had trouble finishing even half of it.
3
Good music, with a young couple playing at the band corner on a Thursday night. Ordered a couple of food items to share, but it was at most acceptable.
4
Great and prompt service! Live band on a Friday night. A little too loud for comfort but overall experience was good.
2
Nice ambience with live band. but food is too expensive. Restaurant ran out of cucumbers for the gin&tonic.
3
Each time I passed by this place I thought about trying. I thought the food and ambience would be great but it was kinda below my expectations. The food portion was too small though the taste was ok. The steak we ordered was ok, but lacked flavor and it was alittle dry.I am a dessert person, but because of the main course let down, I decided to pass my desserts.The overall ambience is ok, just that I expected alittle bit more impressive

My friends and I met up at Spruce this evening for dinner and we were greeted by a warm welcome by Jerry, one of the staff there. He was extremely thoughtful by finding us a spot away from the glaring setting sun and created a light hearted and fun atmosphere for us to dine in. As we have one child with us, he was attentive to the child and ensured that everything has gone well for us for the evening. He constantly checked with us if the meal and drinks were good even when he and his team has been extremely busy due to the dinner rush. We have enjoyed our long awaited dinner gathering thanks to the exceptionally outstanding service of the entire service crew in Spruce

One of my favorite burgers in town! I love the Fire Station Spruce, not only are the burgers incredibly good, but there is also an interesting mix of American and Italian influence thanks to Chef Mauro Scotto. I even heard that he was the former chef and owner of a Michelin-starred restaurant! Definitely worth trying- and fun on weekends too for a leisurely brunch... Plus, thereâ€™s some live music several times a week

Visited Spruce with family for Sunday brunch. We had made a reservation although this was not required as place not busy. Children had burgers - one child did not finish as burger was under-cooked, particularly for a child. I also had the adult version of the burger which I found very tasty and good value - although had to wait much longer as there was a mix up with our order. Good ambience, excellent location and very spacious inside an old fire station.Main problem was the very inattentive service. No apology for mix up over the order, Waitress shuffled across the floor very slowly - had to ask to order, had to ask for dessert menu (she then only reluctantly brought one menu for some reason - there were 5 of us). Took ages to get the bill.When I receive this kind of service in Singapore (which is very often) I so want to send the waiters/waitresses to the USA for a week or two. They would be amazed. With the kind of attitude to service here in Singapore they would not last a day in a restaurant in the USA.No greeting. No smiles. Not asked if we wanted anything else, or whether everything was ok. No incentive for waiters to sell the desserts - even though the dessert we had (carrot cake) was excellent. Why??? It always seems like we are doing them a favour by being there.Come on Singapore... sort out your service
4
Food delivered fast, good atmosphere, good service, good main course.
Desert on display was disappointed though.
5
Only 2 waiting staff to serve lunch crowd. They did their best and service was v good. Will be better with more staff to share the load.
4
We were 7 people and having reserved a table for a busy Sunday morning, the service was quick and efficient. We recommend any of the full on breakfast So!
5
Loved the tender delicious pork ribs. The pork chop is seasoned so nicely!
And the live band....our 11yr old companion totally loved the repertoire! Tot she's in kiss92 heaven!
4
Peculiar place for a restrurant - former fire station. But nicely done up, excellent ambience. Good food too.
4
Ample parking available. Spacious area so good for family with kids. Food was tasty but not wow, normal brunch food.
3
My friends and I enjoyed the tapas very much but felt that the price is a little too steep. We shared a jug of raspberry ice tea and it was great too! We found the mains and pasta of average standard but still palatable. We felt the desserts were quite disappointing though, we had tiramisu and some double chocolate crunch cake. Service was good and prompt and staff were warmth and welcoming. There was live music and the Singers sang quite alright. Seems like they have more interesting brunch menu as compared to dinner menu.

We went on a credit card promotion. The waiter recommended the Tenderloin Steak ($36). When asked how many grams his answer was 100 to 200 gm! Pressed for a more specific answer he said 150gm but didn't sound at all certain. My friend wanted the BBQ Pork Ribs ($34). How many ribs, half rack, full rack? He didn't seem to know. A waitress came - clearly more experienced. Steak 180gm. About 7-8 ribs.When the food came, we were surprised at the small portions, especially the slab of 3 or 4 ribs. Engrossed in conversation, we shared the steak. Then we saw a plate of ribs delivered to the next table. It was more than double the size of the ribs we got. We asked for the manager. He said that the ribs were based on weight and there may be about 10gm difference! Not believing my ears, I asked for the weighing scale. His reply: "Let's not do that. I'll get your plate replaced". Not a word of explanation or apology. So disappointed that there is such a restaurant in Singapore

So its a bit far out so good if you are in the neighbourhood but during workday lunch its a nice place to come for lunch but a bit quiet. Lunch menu is limited and the food not very good. Salad dishes are quite substantial and good if one likes vegetables. I like their brunch menu better but on weekends can go to their Tanglin HQ which has a playground for young children as well
4
Food is consistently good and the prices reasonable. The happy hour is one of the longest in Singapore. A bit understaffed but their service standards have improved a lot over the last two years. One of my favourites and go-to relaxing brunch or dinner places in this area
3
Good food at ok price. Good atmosphere however understaffed. The 1 staff is friendly so kind of make up for the lack of service.
3
Typically the food is great and the service sucks
Today was no different
The service staff needs training and don't know what is on the menu
If you can ignore that bit... It is a relaxed place to have spend a nice Sunday
5
Great ambience, superb service and good food. A hidden gem in the west.
One of the few places to offer Happy Hour prices till Midnight. Special shoutout to the service crew at Spruce, a very attentive and friendly bunch of people. Definitely coming back!

If you do not want to feel disrespected as a customer, don't go to this Spruce branch restaurant. We arrived with two toddlers at lunch time today . Having seen the 'wait to be seated' sign at the entrance , we stood at the entrace waiting to be directed ( there were no one queuing then). After waiting for a couple of minutes, as no one was coming to serve us, my husband went inside the restaurant trying to get someone. He was able to get a waitress who gave us this 4 seats table we saw from outside while we wait . The next thing that happened was beyond our believe. While the waitress was cleaning the table, we saw a lady guest went straight pass the queue ( there were some other guests waiting behind us already then) into the restaurant and few seconds later she sat down at the table which the waitress was prepping for us. It turned out that the table was given by the restaurant manager to the lady guest. When we told him that the waitress has already given the table to us , instead of correcting his mistake of giving out a table that's already been given out, his response was: Sorry, she is a regular guest here so she gets the priority. We couldn't believe it . The manager could have given her any table that was NOT already given to anyone else, but he chose to disrespect us by snatching the table that was given to us to this lady guest showing the utter most disrespect to us as restaurant patrons. I have never felt as discriminated by any hospitality services as this restaurant did.So if you want to have a enjoyable lunch at a place where you are being treated as a respectful customer, don't goto Spruce

Had a great meal on our regular date night. Started with the Spruce Salad and Tuna Mahi Tartare, generous servings of avocado and delectable tuna. Mains -The Spruce burger (medium doneness) was succulent and mouthwatering. Beef tenderloin was grilled to perfection and paired well with the house wine. To top it off, service staff Fei Ming's amicable and prompt service made the meal so enjoyable. Will be back
4
I met girlfriends here for a quick lunch. The restaurant was not particularly busy so lacked a little atmosphere. The staff were very friendly (and very patient with us as we couldn't decide from the menu)! I plumped for their Special Salad which was huge and very tasty. Highly recommended. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating which would be great in the evenings I can imagine. All in all, a great place and relatively inexpensive. There's free parking too

Spruce always delivers when it comes to food. The corn waffles that come with their egg benny is a personal favourite of mine. Their scrambled eggs are also great. Perfectly done each time I've ordered them. The tables are set very close to each other but I guess that's to maximise the seating capacity on the busy weekends. Overall the ambiance although a little too bustling at times for my liking is still comfortable
4
Spruce is perfect for brunch on saturdays on Sundays. The food is well done and the price is alright. The burgers, ribs and tuna are our favourites. The service is very good. They offer wide range of drinks . On Tuesdays and fridays is great for gathering with friends and watching the live band playing
3
I made a booking through Chile for 12 noon but the staff insisted it was for 12.30pm. Nevertheless I was given a take withoutmuch fuss. It took a while for the orders to be taken but food came pretty fast. I had the signature burger which I thought was already. I've had better burgers elsewhere. It was a nice place to meet with friends but note that service was not great. I asked for kids cutlery but they only had plates, no bowls. Would be nice if the waitresses smiled more
5
We went there for an after work lemonade and dinner. The staff is very pleasant, friendly and efficient. The burger is really good, and the salads are tasty. The chef was fine with accommodating our dietary requirements (no cheese in one of the salads) and adding more avocado. The portions are huge! Definitely a great experience, we live nearby so we'll be back for sure
4
Drove past this place multiple times and meaning the try it for the longest time; finally did 2 Sundays ago.Great ambience and setup, utilising the space leftover by the former fire station. Food was good, ordered the Foie Gras as a starter and Beef Short Ribs for the main; both were cooked nicely and the sauces complimented each dish wonderfully. Decided to order the Truffle fries and they were not too bad as well.Special thanks to Mohan (hope I got your name right) and his dedicated crew for the impeccable service.Do give this place a try if you are passing by the next time.Cheer

I went to Spruce at Fire Station for lunch with my friends. I ordered their burger at medium well which was served with herbed fries. I would rate the meal at 7 out of 10. The atmosphere is best for hanging out with your buddies. The cost is reasonable since we spent around 155 SGD for 4 people with each having a full meal along with two rounds of beverages
4
After we hiked throuhg Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok, we ended up at Spruce. They have a nice menu and I really liked their homemade drink with lemon and mint. It's less sweet than all the others I've had before and I really like that!The burgers were good although I couldn't try the Tuna Burger (it was finished)
1
Long wait to be seated even though there were empty tables.once seated no drinks were served. Diners were carrying jugs of water to their own tables. Nobody came to take our orders despite signalling to the wait staff multiple times. After 20 min we left without trying the food
5
Great place to meet up with old friends and catch up over lunch. We shared several dishes and all of them were great . Mushroom risotto was yummy, baked chicken was tender and the salmon was also perfect. We had a salad and a starter too. A bit pricy but the service was great and worth it
4
A very good brunch. About 10 savoury choices and quite a few sweet. We had eggs, salad and goat's cheese (albeit a laughably small amount of cheese). Eggs were hot, all fresh and nicely presented. The steaks looked good, in fact everything did.Service was a little chaotic, but came together in the end.Visit Bukit Batok opposite to walk it off, or the Ford Factory Memories (of the war) Museum just up the road.We will definitely go back and will try the evening when there is a live band

~If you can Tahan the service and be patient you will enjoy Spruce, seating without reservations during the weekend brunch service was quick, it was the multiple repeated orders and repeated calls for the bill that finally arrived that spoiled an otherwise good morning :)~My wife had a bland Lychee Martini, they way it never tasted but absolutely suited to her, it was like drinking unsweetened water but she liked it!~My Rainbow Cake was too dry and I left it after a few big bites :(~The Australian Steak was good but I really liked the Tuna Burger, that was great, a cooked seasoned tuna patty in between buns YUM~So it can't be that bad when my wife returned with our kids a day later for a full brunch, my son loved the Bomb Alaska DDMT
2
Despite our reservation, we were left standing at the counter for about 5 minutes waiting for our table. Understandably it was New Years Day and the place was full but it took the waiters a very long time to serve us and to take our orders. The food was served cold, unpresentable and tasted unlovingly prepared. My drink, a lemonade took a good hour to be served. Needless to say, we won't be back.
4
My SURPRISE 60th birthday party last night at Spruce was a delight. The facility was just the right size for the 38 people who showed up (booked for 50). The food was excellent, particularly the sea bass. The set-up, music, ambiance were PERFECT. Not too stuffy and definitely a sense of 'class'. My bride chose a great place and her 2 months worth of planning really paid off. The service on drinks was just average and the pitchers of soft drinks got a bit watered down with ice, but on the whole, it was a great evening for our family and friends, some of whom showed up 4.5 hours early to set-up balloons, signs and other decorations
4
Came at late night and the place is pretty nice. It's near from Springdale Condominium which I stay. The staff served me and my friends well even we just ordered drinks. The price is pretty cheap for the kind of bar. Luckily, I came on Sunday night there was a big screen to watch football match without additional entry fee
