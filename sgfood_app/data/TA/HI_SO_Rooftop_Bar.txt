Saw that there was Happy Hour Wine Tues with $10/glass but server said it was an old menu. And wine was served in plastic glass. Not worth it for $17-18/glass ans wine wasnt even good. Ambience was also so-so. Very different from the photos posted!

Maybe it’s a new place. Maybe it was a school night. Whatever it was, it wasn’t what we expected it at all. There was practically nobody there, a sad love song was playing in the background, and the service was generally pretty slow.
4
This was the rooftop bar on our hotel. Not a huge pool but absolutely stunning scenery. Comfortable, casual and good service.
2
No atmosphere, expensive drinks, view of buildings as dusk falls is the best part of this bar. It is part of the Sofitel Hotel and just feels like a hotel bar. Much better bars and rooftop bars to be found in Singapore.
5
Good place for after work drinks with girlfriends on Wednesday nights, where ladies get one free glass of yummy champagne!
4
Nice place to sit and have a cocktail while the sun goes down. Great cocktails and very friendly service
5
This is a very good place for hanging out during happy hour and more. The location is nice, swimming pool with view over the Singapore skyline. Nice for winding down after a day's work.
5
Excellent little rooftop bar. Staff friendly and welcoming and in the evening you are treated to the tantalizing fragrance from the the satay vendors in the street below
5
We went to a special event for Accor members there for drinks and food for a set discount price and had a great time. The bar is relaxed and the staff attentive. We spent a few hours having drinks and eating the freshly cooked satays which were delicious. There was a DJ but we weren’t the right demographic for that kind of music.
3
We asked for a bottle of Prosecco that was on the menu, and after some time they came back with a different and more expensive one, as the one we choose was “out of stock”. Then the entire staff vanished, and to get napkins or one more glass for a friend joining was a real challenge. Location is amazing, but, guys, service is also requested when you make your guests pay a price
3
not the best place I would go. Drinks are expensive. Car park was in accessible with Lau pasat blocking the entrance at night.
5
The pool at my hotel so went up here a few times. The view and atmosphere at 6am when it opens is great.
5
the rooftop bar is well located and quiet during the afternoon. the action picks up in the evening. Harold is a helpful, cheerful host
5
Great cocktails...beautiful gold tiled pool! The staff and service at this lovely 143 room boutique hotel are exceptional.
3
The view is nice but the place quite small, we went on Friday night and it's was quiet .. drink r pricey but that standard for Singapore the pool is nothing likes internet photo ., we had 1 drink and left because it's wasn't look like what we expected...
4
Was there with: friends stopping by from Europe Expected: a good view and a big place Received: a decent view and a small place  +++ (PROS)The hotel has a great position and a more modern vibe compared to a normal Sofitel The music was good the evening I was there A very funny and chatty Dutch staff - - - (CONS)The idea of a rooftop is to have great views right? But all the buildings around Sofitel So are taller. I wouldn't emphasize on "rooftop".  The plastic wine glasses they serve you the drinks. They said it's to protect the pool in case glasses break but still, this is supposed to be a classy place. Bottom line:I was there twice and the service was inconsistent. More given by the staff's character than by standards you would expect.

Nice area on top of a city hotel. The bar menu was too limited - should expand, but the food we did try was very good. But each time we went there music was blasting. Sometimes it is nice to sit in peace or with softer background music. The pool is ok, smallish, but in a very limited space. Staff are attentive and generally service is good
2
This bar is very nice. The location is great and though it is a rooftop you feel diminshed by the tall buildings surrounding it. I loved that effect. As for the drinks, they are good but the service is not so good. Mosfo the staff is slow and make you wait with no apparent reason (in fact, there were only two other tables and they kept us waiting quite long even though we called them a few times). I love the hotel but I think the bar could be better managed
5
We visited here several times during our stay in Singapore and found it to be a wonderful escape from the traffic and the people in this ever moving city. The staff were friendly and personable and the bites and drinks were enjoyable. The pool setting is also very relaxed and we made sure during the heat of the day we also enjoyed these amenities. Great spo
3
The bar is nice enough. Compared to some other Rooftop bars in Singapore, it is pretty low (7 floors up), and so their isn't really a view to speak of. Still, the staff are excellent, and very friendly and professional, which made it a nice experience
5
We had a cocktail here each afternoon of our stay, Louis was a great host, you have the choice of sitting in the sun of being under shade which was nice.
3
Bar was lacking a lot of items from menu e.g. no mint for mojito, no truffle fries, only sliders from a choice of about 8 selections.
1
Very disappointed. My reservation was cancelled by the restaurant last minute. Reason given is because of private function.
3
Place is good
Nice ambience
Decent expat crowd.
Nice and clean pool, even though it is small.
Last time attended a pool party which was even better
Cons:
Drinks are bit expensive
Some places quite sweaty and very hot
5
The roof top bar send pool were a relaxing place to be even when the sun wasn'the shining. The bar staff were friendly and attentive.
5
We were guests at the Sofitel So Hotel, so we´ve lounged by the pool during daytime when returning from the city and have also enjoyed the pool party with Dj Friday night.
Cozy little roof top bar with pool
5
we enjoyed the pool party but the pool is too small but nice view
friendly bar service by the waitress
4
Was at Hi-SO for a business networking event, and I must say even for a Singaporean, the view offered is amazing. It's not everyday you get to have an open air rooftop pool right smack in the middle of the city, and it certainly makes for an interesting venue for private events.Space is a bit small, yet comfortable enough for guests to mingle. And kudos to the bar counter staff for being friendly and approachable
3
Had a complimentary "Singapore Sling" which was more like a mock tail. This place drinks list is expensive so we were so disappointed to be served such a weak cocktail. After complaint we did receive a improved cocktail that was slightly better.... this bar could be so much better with the right attitude because the venue is great.... disappointed by no live entertainment on friday the 16th on December 201
2
Went for a drink on the roof top terrace whilst staying here. It was not busy at all but I only got served because I approached the bar. Had to go to the bar to ask for both a second drink and for the bill. More focus on the customer needed
3
We enjoyed a few drinks here one afternoon, but we did find it extremely expensive. Service was good but the pricing is far too expensive
4
This bar is on the 6th floor.
Easy to get to and plenty of room
Pool is close by the bar.
We had a beer and red wine there and was thoroughly enjoyable.
Staff were helpful. A lot of high rise buildings around though.
5
Nice roof top bar to have a cocktail next to the pool
I love that it's a level 6, so you are surrounded by skyscrapers
5
we were staying in the hotel so it was easy. Nonetheless a great pool, good views and great cocktails
5
Nice rooftop pool, with lovely views which can be seen whilst cooling off in the water. Nice loungers, with attentive bar staff on hand to take your orders. Lovely way to end the day, swimming and slurping under the stars!

We stayed here during the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. The pool bar is not open until 3pm. We are at the pool since 11am, called the reception, they can't send drinks to the bar and we can't order any drinks at all. So disappointed as we usually order drinks and snacks if there is a bar beside the pool, whether in S'pore, Phuket or Bali. Guess this pool bar is only open afternoon till night. So over-promised, So under-delivered & So disappointing.. it's the small gestures that make a difference...sigh.
4
The smallest infinity pool in Singapore I've ever seen. Cosy yet not suitable to pool party at all as I cant even swim ! However, this place is really great for non event days for food n drinks if u r a pool lover ! Open to public, how awesome is that !
4
Great place to spend the evening, especially if you are a guest in the Sofitel SO. The Rooftop Bar is located on the 6th floor, so it might not 100% qualify as rooftop, but the city view is anyway very decent. The 6th floor also hosts the hotel pool which improves the atmosphere of the place
5
This bar has great views. It also has ladies night with a free glass of champagne, and a great DJ. on other nights there was a pop up designer shop. If this is not enough the cocktails are fantastic and comparable to other Singapore prices. Service can be a bit slow, but very serious.
4
We were attracted by the fantastic decor if this hotel and grativated towards the rooftop bar. There were daily special prices from mondays to fridays! Great! We had a couple of free champagnes and the usual pub food such as buffalo wings and fries. Place isn't too big. Reservations are possible but be on time... Drinks variety good- cocktails, shots, beers, wines. Air was rather still. Do not wear long sleeves her
5
If you have the chance - go there. Twice a month - first and last Saturday in the month a party place to be. cool music - beautiful people. For hotel guests free - starts early in the afternoon. Until around 11 p.m. Amazing atmosphere!
5
Great pool, evening events, drinks a little pricey. The view is nice they door have happy hour during the week.
3
This is a great rooftop oasis at Sofitel So. Lots of seating and a good pool for walking or cooling off. Change rooms. The bar is good but when we used the area the staff were not very helpful, unlike other areas of the hotel
4
We enjoyed a happy hour special after a long flight. Very urban environment so not sure about swimming in the daytime.
5
The rooftop bar and pool are one of the coolest ive seen in a metro area. The drinks are definitely a little pricey, but overall worth it.
4
Have been there as the hotel guest and it is nice for a drink. View is also great! A bit quite after 10 but you can always go somewhere else after that.
3
It's nice when it's quiet, but a bit dull save for the pool (I visited on a weekday evening, which would explain why it's empty). They do not craft drinks and follow the menu's options, which are priced at hotel rates. The bar has football on the screen but otherwise there's nothing spectacular or enticing about this place

I passed by the hotel where this bar is located and saw a cozy and nice cocktail bar in the ground floor. I went in and I was suggested by the staff in there to go up to the sixth floor where I could have a 1 for 1 offer on drinks, and thought why not. I went up and the place was nice, with a swimming pool and all. However, when ordering drinks the disaster hit. First the waitress didnt know what drinks were included in the 1 for 1, so she checked. She said wines, beers and spirits. No cocktails, which was the reason I came in downstairs, but I thought OK, lets have some nice red wine and a cheese platter. We order 2 glasses of a merlot, and the waitress says sorry, only one wine for that. I say what is it, she says a cabernet, and I like cabernet sauvignon wines, so I said OK, go ahead. We also ordered a cocktail with the wines and cheese. When the wine came, I was shocked. Plastic cups, and covered in water droplets! And the wine inside, oh my, what a disadtrous wine! It was like vinegar! The cocktail came and it was what i would expect from a low quality discotheque serving 100 drinks per minute to people who dont care about the taste at all--i.e., another disaster, a watered down mojito I wouldnt usually pay a dollar for, and it was 18SGD. I rejected the wine and the waitress acted as if she already knew the wine was horrendous, probably other customers rejected it too, but they still kept at it trying to push it to unknowing customers. The environment with the swimming pool and the cheese platter were the only dim lights among all these shadows. At least the cheeses were good

We visited the rooftop bar a few times over the past week as were staying at the hotel.It's a great place for a swim and one end of the pool has a clear side to see through.The bar is quite nice, very friendly, helpful and professional staff.The juice mocktail was delicious, as was the champagne.Food is also nice, reflective of the hotels 5 star rating.Food and drinks are a little expensive though, again probably reflective of the hotels 5 star rating. Great place to have a drink and snack to eat

The Hi-So Rooftop Pool & Bar has, in the past 6 months, become the prime Saturday daytime social scene in Singapore...this is in no small part the fast-growing event company "Eyes To The Front" making the Hi-So its go-to location for their weekend events...and with this partnership comes quite a devout group of Singapore's "it crowd". At one of these Saturday pool parties expect to be met with highly energy, subtle sophistication, and a welcoming vibe thats sure to make you feel immediately like part of the "family". The weekly events thrown by ETTF also book Singapore's most well known and in-demand DJs with support from local and international headliners so don't be surprised to hear some of the best pool-oriented House Music this side of Ibiza. If you've yet to drop by on a Saturday for a poolside mojito or to just catch with your friends while taking in the relaxed, sun-soaked atmosphere...the time is now. You won't be disappointed

Great atmosphere, awesome music, good vibes. If you are looking for a lot of fun, this is the place for you! 👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

famed wednesday nights seem to have lost a bit of its popularity. need to enhance its vegetarian menu.
5
HiSo is very nice, friendly staff, fast service and great Champagne at super price. High seats are a little uncomfortable after a while and the music by the DJ was quite loud
5
Beautiful setup, welcoming staff, great food and drinks at affordable price. Had a lot of fun at their pool parties, definitely recommanding this one!

I enjoyed a few drinks here on a recent trip to Singapore. There's some nice comfy seating and the bar service is friendly and efficient. Due to its location (and height) the views don't match those of other bars in the area but, had I been on vacation and not working, I would probably have used it a lot more as a good soak in a pool with a drink in your hand always goes down well
4
Breathtaking experience when you soak inside the pool with a drink or just chill on a cozy sofa right beside the water. One Big Family student community organised a couple of pool party events and, believe me, the demand was extraordinarily huge which could have been measured in the number of people inside the pool and beer bottles left afterwards. As it was admission free, the roof top bar earned quite a lot on the drinks( I would say, booze and non-alcoholic drinks were pretty expensive.Make sure to take some pictures as the view is simply stunning. Btw, one of the walls of the pool is transparent...Dare to stand close to the edge

Bar has nice atmosphere and is close to the CBD but that is where the positive comments end. The service is the worst I've ever experienced anywhere in Singapore let alone a high-class bar. The table was oily and the wait staff gave us attitude when we asked them to clean it, it took ages to get their attention to come get our order: they just kept walking away! There was a little plaque displaying happy hour rates on the table but then it turns out were were allowed to order from that menu for another hour (no time limit stated on the plaque itself), when I tried to order from their extensive menu it turns out only 10% of what is available on the menu was available. My colleague ordered a Pinot Grigio (which apparently wasn't available but was never told) and ended up getting a different type of white wine. I ordered a redwine that was served in a plastic cup and was ice cold. Couldn't say terrible enough times. A lot of people reviewing on this page looks like they are actually trying to write a review for the bar in Bangkok. This bar is terrible. Don't waste your time and money. There are much nicer bars out there in Singapore around the same area
5
Don't miss this one. Everyone goes to Lebua from Hangover 2 but this one located in Sofitel on the 29th floor. It's has an amazing view over the Lamphini Park towards all the modern new skyscrapers in Bangkok. There is no dress code for the bar
3
A nice tranquil corner of the hotel to spend some time, well stocked bar, showers, cabana style areas and a smallish pool. Its only a small boutique style hotel but any more than 20 people up here and it would start to feel crowded very quickly.The pool is an oversized lap pool at best, but better than nothing to get away from the Singapore heat.
1
The service was truly bad. I made a reservation for 3 but was given a table for 2. When I tried taking an additional chair, the staff stopped me insisting that I only booked for 2. After showing them my confirmation, they blamed it on the Chope app for miscommunication. Food menu was very limited with only a few items. We ordered Truffle Fries (which were good!) and a Club Sandwich. Our sandwich order was forgotten and we waited more than an hour for it. I also tried requesting for some additional sauce for my fries as we had finished others, and was told I had to pay for it. Service was truly terrible, view was ok but not worth going back again.
