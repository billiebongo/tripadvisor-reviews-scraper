Not our first time there. Food was excellent (mains), desserts were very good as usual. Servers were generally attentive and friendly. Overall it was reasonably priced for the standard of food and service we received.
4
And as a bonus they now have Singapore fusion innovations like a nasi lemak burger (with pandan lemak rice as the bun) and sweet and sour kurobuta sandwich. Casual fine dining at its best!
4
Nice Ambien. Pretty furniture. Good service. We had the chope 1 for 1 set menu. Main menu option sizes were smaller than normal. But comes w soup or appetiser and a dessert
5
Staffs were friendly,very easy to converse with. Making sure we are taken care of and enjoying ourselves. Foods were unique. Can't miss out their desserts. Looks amazing and taste fabulous. The place is peaceful. It's a good place to bring your partner for a date.
5
Nice ambience, good food, suitable for couples to chill and talk. Abit pricey but I think it was worth for the quality of the food.
4
Surprisingly very few people on a Sunday, only 1 wait staff. Chairs and tables a bit dated but food was good. Eggs florentine was good, pancakes very small (only 2 pieces). Cakes good as usual
5
Very friendly waiters. Relaxing and posh atmosphere, so good for weekend dating! Great food, yummy cake and drink! Love it!! Will go back again !
4
We had a very enjoyable dinner. Only had a main course but our dishes were very nicely prepared and presented. The cafe is a blend of a restaurant and a tea house. I was surprised that no wine was available but that didnâ€™t detract from our experience. We were also able to pick up a delectable treats for friends.
5
We took a friend that lives in Singapore here for afternoon tea.Well this is a gem the cakes are to die for and one of the best coffees I have had in a long time. like an old english tea room.the pricing is high 4 cakes and 4 coffees averaged $77 singapore. but worth it
4
The desserts wowed us over the mains. The rice seems to oily with the butter and the crab pasta a little too spicy for my liking. However the manager was taking our critics seriously and been attentive throughout our dining. Lovely and cozy for gals meetup. Skip the mains and dive straight to the desserts
4
Nice place and ambience! Staff is friendly. Good coffee and cakes! Great place to relax and enjoy catch up with friends!
4
Great desserts! Duck rillette was spot on. Crab pasta not too bad but could afford a little more taste. Overall pleasant dining experience
4
The parking was accessible. The decor was elegant and cosy. The food was good. We particularly liked the onion soup and dessert
5
Great service & ambience, food is ok, can be better. Staff is v attentive to our needs & keep checking on us.
4
Place is pretty. Savoury dishes were wawesome. Cakes were not that fantastic although all look so pretty.
4
Ambience was pleasant, perfect for couples especially. Food and dessert were fantastic given the prices.

We just arrived in Singapore 2 days ago and had no idea where to go for our December 31 st supper. By pure chance, we found this place right by our not so great hotel. We took a chance and I'lm happy we did.This restaurant is not really French, but French inspired. The menu is all over the place with old type French cuisine like Boeuf Bourguignon or onion soup, and more national food like Italian risotto. The food was very good and we were very happy with our choice. Add great desserts and good wine to the above plus a very friendly waiter....and I have to say we had a great evening. Also a very nice decor.A bit pricey, but that's ok for our last meal of 2017.Recommended
5
The restaurant is close by and I always enjoy it. It’s a kind of combination of classic decoration and fusion menu, so you can always find something attractive. Dessert is the highlight and you cannot miss it. My favourite is the strawberry shortcake and it’s a perfect match with the coffee. Ideal place for afternoon tea or a brunch.
3
Returning to Antoniette for a birthday celebration and to try out their new local fusion menu. The pork shop bun and nasi lemak burger was enjoyable and portion is quite big. The desserts which they are famous for looks and tasted delectable. Service was ok, no special treatment for birthday. Seems they can't be bothered.
5
Was having a birthday dinner with a friend, I have requested from the service staff to write happy Birthday wording on the plate, she did it for me. And when she deliver the cake to us, she even put a candle for us. Thank you so much. Food was nice n dessert was nice to see
5
Great service and ambience. The staff was helpful and friendly and sang my boyfriend a happy birthday song :-)
4
Nice cozy place for catching up over a great meal with BFFs , attentive staff and knowledgeable with menu recommendation. Overall an entirely awesome experience from the time we walked through the door till the end .
4
Love the ambiance. I was late but they kept my table. Good service overall.
Cakes and macaroons were fantastic.
Had a great time!
3
We tried the local food of new menu which was quite disappointing (Nasi Lemak and Hakka food) as compared to the traditional outlets available in Singapore. I still prefer the food in the old menu.
4
Few minutes walk from the MRT. Food is good as usual and staffs as usual are prompt. Setting was also good. Will be back again
4
Great ambience! Brought my mum for a simple birthday lunch at this restaurant. Their service was quite up to expectation. We ordered the nasi lemak burger to share, portion was big enough for both of us as our appetite was small. The chili was amazing. The cake has a smooth texture, not overly riched, just like for our liking
5
Hidden away in Lavender is a teleport machine that will transfer you to France in the 1940s where waiters have charm and banter, you can get a bottle of bubbles for less than $30 and eat food that fills you up, tastes divine and won't break the bank.
4
This french style cake shop/restaurant is located off the beaten path, if there is such a thing in Singapore. The food is decent if not outstanding, mainly due to so so ingredients at a fairly fancy price but the cakes are outstanding as desert. So make sure you donâ€™t miss that part of the meal
5
2 ladies ate 3 mains and 3 desserts. that's how good our meal was. my tourist relative was flying out and i insisted on rushing to Antoinette for her last meal in Sg to cap off the trip as i've had great experiences there previously. the food and service were awesome and she left with the best memories of Sg
3
European style cafe - you feel like you are tai tai when dine it. The cafe's interior is nice and comfortable. The desserts looks so cute and adorable although a bit expensive. The desserts taste good but too sweet for me, so it is best to go with a pot of tea. The food tasted average
5
Thoroughly enjoyable. French onion soup (starter) was very authentic, and the duck rillette (main) was also very tasty.
4
Visited on a weekend evening and the service was great! Staff was attentive and made the effort to reserve the best-selling cakes. Tried the antoinette cake, as well as the croissant de la creme. It was delicious!
4
Enjoyed the food although the portion was very small. Dishes were very unique. Set did not come with their usual nice pot of tea though. Will definitely come again.
4
Mushroom soups were awesome.
Chili crab tagatalie was good too.
However french food come in french portions so if u r hungry, prepare to order more.
They have super pricey drinks though the elderflower drinks were nice.
5
Food is good as usual, and staff friendly. Newer staff needs to be more atttentve and which they would move the distasteful big green rubbish bin fr their entrance though
4
I enjoy the good food and excellent service with superb value in this restaurant with my friend on Saturday afternoon. Will go back soon.
5
It was our first experience at Antoinette. Was mesmerized by the concept inside. Busy taking photographs of the cafe. The dessert and food you must really try. One visit is not sufficient. You have to make many trips there to try their entire menu and new creations.
4
A lovely and welcoming ambience with impeccable service rendered by the staff, the food was just as satisfying! Ordered the hakka gnocchi, chilli crab arancini and the orient(salted egg yolk cake with coconut mousse) which I truly enjoyed! My favourite was the chilli crab arancini which are deep fried chilli crab balls filled with a cheesy surprise and juicy, lumpy crabmeat. It also comes with a flavourful, tangy and spicy chilli crab sauce! The orient was just as delectable, with a salted egg yolk interior adorned with coconut mousse and a base of crunchy peanut feuillitine. The salted egg flavour is distinct, with a pleasant lingering saltiness that was a great complement to the soft, light and airy mousse and the crunchy, crisp peanut feuilltine.
4
Always loved Antoinette for their ambience, cakes and macarons. Especially the antoinette cake and Salted caramel macarons, lovely. This time I had the 1-1 promotion reserved through Chope. Thats quite disappointing as the portions are small - seems like half+half instead. Felt abit cheated that it's not exactly a "promo". Good thing is their cake of the day remains awesome.
1
1-for-1 set meal promotion via chope at $50 is a scam. The potions are ridiculously small. It has to be seen to be believed. They basically just halve the standard portions. We have to go for second round dinner after that. Even my over 70 year old mom is not half filled after that meal
4
Cakes are always good as usual ,just the price is on the deep side but the drink is so so not worth the price at all
5
The limited edition nasi lemak burger is marvellous. My wife's aglio olio is very delicious too. Can't wait to return to try the Hakka gnocchi.
5
Quiet atmosphere to enjoy a meal with your special one. Creative yet astonishing dessert that melts in your mouth.
5
Great cakes, place to unwind. Always a Favourite hangout for ME time. Love the breakfast range too. Highly recommended
5
Chef Pang's incredible creations all in one place. Paying normal restaurant prices but you get world class dining pleasure.
4
This restaurant is well known for its quality of desserts and certainly did not disappoint us. We ordered items from both the a la carte menu as well as the dinner set menus as it was our first time here. he food taste is better than what you get from most restaurants and the kitchen puts in the effort to present their dishes well. I had expected better service and ambience from the restaurant than what I experienced on my first dining experience. The service was average, several dishes were not available which was unusual on a Saturday evening which you would expect that they would have ample resources and materials to fulfill the complete menu. I wonder if the opening of another outlet in town has diluted their quality of service
5
Been wanting to try Antoinette. Though the nasi lemak burger is off the menu, the mains & cakes are still worth going to. When first stepped in, the cakes drew my attention entirely. The colors were fab & looks were mesmerizing. The mains sounded foreign to me but bloggers review made my choice much easier.
4
Upon entering, the display of the cake slices and gift counter brighten up mu mood. Went during the lunch crowd, was a bit noisy. Order the Nasi Lemak burger, the otak has this coconut fragrant. The chicken meat was humongous! I remove the flour so I could finish everything. (the meat still consider big even after I removed the flour) It was well marinated and tender too. I wont deny that the flour coating was thick but I think the effort in creating this deserves a thumbs-up.
4
Chef Pang's recommendations were spot on. The Aglio Oglio was the best I've tastedKale Salad was very nicely decoratedThe Hakka Gnocchi was an interesting twist of local hakka abacus made with beetroot and pumpkin with fried foie gras.The wagyu beef was not too bad.For dessert, we shared mouth watering Antoinette signature cake and a salted egg cake. They were so good ! And ended the night with two pots of Chamomile Tea.Overall we enjoyed our dinner All four friends love the food and it was only $180. With Chope voucher we saved some money :

Although it was 6pm, we were told that the place was full on reservations. In the end we were showed to a table in the centre provided that we would leave 10 minutes to 7pm. Although we had decided our orders, there was problems regarding our order of drinks, as well as serving of the food. We had ordered a certain dish which the opposite table also ordered, but they were served first. Suspected that the young server had forgotten about our order, as the dish only turned up when we reminded him. We feedback to the cashier about the issue who gave a reason that the other table had ordered the dish in advance which was highly unlikely as we distinct heard the other table asking if that particular dish was available during ordering. He was quite a blur one who did not serve the dish with cutlery or water and we had to remind him a number of times.Hakka Gnocchi ($24++)dried shrimp, foie gras, cured pork, morelThe serving was quite small. The gnocchi were quite colourful, chewy and went quite well with the minced savoury topping.XXXL Nasi Lemak Burger ($20++) XXXL Chicken, first marinated and then coated with Chef Pangâ€™s favourite batter that reminds him of the fried chicken he had at school canteen when he was young. The exterior is incredibly crispy, with a juicy and succulent chicken breast within. Promising a spicy kick, the homemade otah is made with fresh mackerel and prawn. The aromatic sambal, a requisite ingredient in any traditional nasi-lemak offering, is a blend of chilli, dried shrimps, shallots and only gula Melaka was used for a subtle sweetness and the aromatic finish. Upping the nostalgia factor is the luncheon meal.The dish finally arrived after a long wait, after finding the opposite table having it first before us. The rice was fragrant and moist. The sambal was delicious spicy sweet. But the fried chicken was disappointingly dry.Orient ($9++)white lotus seed mousse, coconut cake, salted peanut sesame praline and a flowy salted egg cremeuxThe salted egg cremeux reminded one of liu sha pau. The most interesting part was the crunchy salted peanut sesame praline right at the bottom.Iced Lychee Orange Tea ($7++)The young server told us it was unavailable but a check with the counter it was available. refreshing drink.Antoinette's Hot Chocolate ($7++)vanilla perfumed hot chocolateOrdered it as my first 2 choices of Peach Melba Tea ($9++) and Camouflage Matcha Cafe Latte ($7.50++) were not available. The drink was rich and more on the bitter side
4
Tried the lasi lemak burger which was true to taste. The usual menu was alrite. Could have more seasonal selections for variety...
4
We had their Nasi Lemak Burger, Salted egg yolk croissant & Rose cake! The burger was very delicious, good for sharing! The croissant was very cruncy! The rose was too pretty to eat!
2
Breakfast menu is not available.
Limited choice of main course for early lunch at 11am. Food average and is way over-priced.
4
We went for dinner in weekdays. Not as crowded as what we expected. We ordered salad and risotto and the portion of dishes served is quite small. After the main course, we enjoy the delicious cakes and coffee drinking in nice and quiet environment.
5
We were warmly welcomed, our glasses were always filled with water. The staff were attentive, jovial, friendly and fun. We found an ant on 'The Queen's Vacherin' running around in the sugar and they immediately replaced it with a new plate. Had a good experience.
5
Dinner was good but the cakes was Awesome! Though the pricing was at the high side but still Strongly Recommend.
2
So my search for the best crepes is, sadly to say, unsuccessful! The crepe itself is so doughy with too much sweetness overload. The staff is as disappointing as their food. Totally knock off!
4
The requisite neoclassical / rococo decor and ornamentation in Antoinette Cafe contrived to recreate the period theme of the place and I somehow felt it didn't quite evoke the 'aura'.I put it to the disorientation of 'stepping into' an affectatious 18th Century French drawing room, in the midst of the Lavender Street area. Or perhaps it was the immaculately attired waiting staff that looked but didn't quite play the part. Maybe it was a quite time of the day (at 5.30pm), service was rather slow.Anyway, we enjoyed our coffees and savoured the cakes (Antoinette Petit - j'adore!; Cafe Blanc caramel - délicieux! et macarons - irrésistible!).
5
Visited Antoinette @Penhas again after lunch for some desserts with my friend. We ordered crepe, a cake ; Rose flavoured, and the 'Threesome' tea. The cake was well balanced without feeling too overwhelming on the palate. The crepe was soft and not overly sweet. All this was accompanied by the light, refreshing tea. Service was great just as it was during my first visit 2 months ago. Will not hesitate to visit again
4
Love the white background with classic furniture and decorations. The food is good especially the Grandmother Stuffed Chicken Leg with super tender meat enclosed in thin crispy skin. The gnocchi is delicious and the onion soup is very rich served with tasty cheese crsips. The cakes are so colourful and look pretty
5
I did a farewell dinner for my friend in the restaurant. The ambience in the restaurant was cozy and relaxing which is very suitable to have a private chat. The staff, especially John who was very attentive and made good suggestion for our meal. I am delighted to see the chef walked out from the kitchen to check on the dinning experience.Salade Antoinette is a must try item. It was so refreshing and stood out from the rest of the salad I used to have. Their pasta dishes were so good as they are not the usual pasta dish that you can easily find in other restaurants. Antoinette makes their own creation but yet it tastes very well.If you love dessert, then Antoinette is definitely a place for your to visit more frequently. The range of cakes, macarons and chocolates are just amazing. Again thanks to John who made very good recommendation to us for having different type of cakes to ensure that we are not overdosed with chocolate
1
We ordered summer salad, burger elysee and wagyu agnolotti. Salad presentation was great - can't say it was refreshing as it was too heavy with quinoa. Wagyu came and tasted like regular beef in tomato. Burger was most disappointing. The beef patty was chewy and overdone - almost frozen beef. The foie gras is totally out of place and in one word, disgusting. Not going back for sure
5
Visited Antoinette @ Penhas for a late lunch with my partner. We arrived around 2pm and the restaurant was rather vacant, which was nice. The decor was rather fitting to its overall French style and was really comfy. Service was great and the service staff were really attentive throughout our time there and got us squared away rather quickly after being seated. We ordered a breakfast set; inclusive of a drink, assortment of pastries and a potato gnocchi, cooked carbonara style. And a strawberry shortcake after the meal: see picture.
1
Had dinner at this place in February 2017. We expected something special, but we were very disappointed. We were seated by a grimy door that long ago needed a fresh coat of paint. The mushroom soup was watery, the crepes were doughy, and the sauce on the beef was like gravy from a can. The staff were disinterested. A total waste of money
5
I booked the place for my hubby birthday as he mentioned the cake are awesome and he is not a cake person. The lunch was awesome too. We really had a wonderful birthday lunch there and definitely all their cakes are awesome!I will definitely go back for mor
5
This place is amazing. As soon as you walk through the door you are transported to Paris! The decor, seating and general ambience is wonderful. They have a wide range of options on the menu along with a selection of teas. However their desserts are the best part! They have really friendly and attentive staff who really make the place!Great place!RegardsOma

Even though the Lavender scene is packed with novelty hipster cafes (such as Chye Seng Huat Hardware) and great dining spots (such as Lighthouse Bistro), Antoinette still manage to secure itself as not just another cafe but an original entity. Upon entering, I immediately succumbed to the rows of colorful macarons and cakes demanding the attention of my sweet tooth. Recently one of the owner chef's offer that grabbed foodie's attention is their own lineup of cheese tarts to ride on the sudden craze, so naturally I had to grab some for myself. Their creamy texture and indisputable heavenly flavors earned our full score right after first chomp. My personal favorite has to be the Salted Caramel version for its addictive caramel taste (or was it just me?).While Antoinette's array of confectioneries impressed the hell out of us, its main courses were less so. Antoinette tried their best to decorate the place to fit their name but seems to fall short. The place looks like any other local western restaurant and the menu is the only thing that fits a French atmosphere. Nevertheless their reputation for creating and offering novel pastry and confectioneries is well earned, and the place is great for spending some quality tea time with a cup on one hand and something sweet and tasty on the other
4
Antoinette is the best place if you like to eat in an old French boudoir atmosphere.The restaurant offer a nice menu for breakfast with fine and tasteful products such as duck, wild mushrooms and fresh vegetables.More over, if you want to treat yourself, you can buy one of their fantastic cakes at the counter, to enjoy when you'll be at home.Service is friendly and professional. Well check the opening hours on their website as the restaurant is quite far from the city center by walk and there is nothing to do/see in the neighborhood
4
A great place for desserts. Love the cakes, although they are of a higher price. A good place for lunch with friends. We had maincourse too, but did not take any pics. However, it ia good enough to go for the exquisite cakes! Price is slightly higher thoug
4
Ordered a cake for birthday celebration so decided to have a try in the cafe when we went to collect it. Ordered the crepes and it was good coupled with a pot of tea. Collected my cake but was a little dismayed at the choice of candles given. The candles did not do justice to the lovely cakes. Should look into this
4
Good food, good service, clearly well trained staff, very pleased and happy with the overall dining experience
4
Stopped in to try the salted egg croissant that I had read about on a food blog and it was delicious! We had lunch as well. :)
4
This is one nice french style restaurant. We arrived a bit late after dinner but we tried 2 desert here which i think one worth visited cafe around Lavender hotel where we stayed. Maybe we will try our dinner here as well.
2
Pastry was ok but with the pricing... what else could we expect? unfortunately, they fail to deliver french chic & style with it's cheap decor... really need to work in that department.
4
The interior takes you to another era. Food wise, the salted egg-yolk croissant stood out for the savory selection, which I notice tends to be on a generous side. The Gnocchi Carbonna was a disappointment though…But our aim is their FANTASTIC looking cakes! Really delicious and extremely pleasing to the eye. Their teas are worth a try – Moulin Rogue, Geisha Earl and Iced Yuzu, Mango and passion fruit green tea
4
This was my 1st visit here in 2016, & I was wondering if their food was still good. Their Classic Eggs Florentine was as good as ever with superbly done eggs Benedicts. Tried the Crab Pomodoro pasta for the first time and it had fresh chilli crab and sauce. It was delicious and well cooked. I finally tried their famous Salted Egg Yolk Lava Croissant, which is indeed one of the best in Singapor
4
Read about how good the salted egg croissant is so tried it recently. It was yummy. The chilli crab crossiant is good too but not keen on the matcha one.If available, I would strongly recommend the salted egg cheese tart too. Too good to resist!
4
From my two visits to Antoinette's Penhas outlet and my last one visit to Mandarin Gallery outlet (merely to indulge in the croissants) I believe that the Penhas outlet serve better croissants. :)I tried 4 out of 6 Croissants they offered. The Salted Yolk Lava Croissant, the Chili Crab Croissant, the Charcoal Kaya Croissant, and the Salted Caramel Croissant. The Salted Yolk Lava Croissant was awesome! The smooth, creamy and decadent salted egg yolk, with a savoury slant, oozing out of the light and airy croissant, making the overall taste closer to that of a real salted egg. The Chili Crab Croissant combines the croissant with a chilli crab filing of real crabmeat, specially concocted spices and a house-made sauce to create the comforting sweet and spicy flavours. The lingering spiciness was simply yums!The filling of the Charcoal Kaya Croissant is made with coconut cream and pure pandan juice with no artificial colours or flavouring. It's a satiny creme patisserie with a subtle and oh-so-lovely-hints of coconut and pandan. This was so irresistible! I found the Salted Caramel Croissant was a little too rich and sweet for me, nevertheless I'm a sweet tooth.My recommendation is to have the croissants with Antoinette extensive array of tea to fully appreciate the croissants with these various fillings.Read more my review as Sassy Eater at UrbanOutEaters

I was here late in the afternoon and was surprised that this cafe served very good sandwich and French Toast. I saw others ordered breakfast as it is available round the clock. I didn't since I had good breakfast too that morning. Sure I will come back for their breakfast. Reasonable price for the quality of the food.
3
Salted egg croissant is over rated. Slightly warmish and is very expensive $6.50++ per piece. Good to share as it's too much for one person. French toast ham & cheese came soaked in maple syrup. Didn't like that as it was soggy. Cream that came with it is nice. Cappuccino at $6.50++ was a very small cup and no effort on the milk foam design that didn't even look like any shape. Service staff by young people, for the ambience and price of the menu, service standard is below expectations. Wouldn't go back again
4
Made a trip to the cafe during lunch to try the renowned salted egg yolk croissant. It was delicious!!! Pricing of the food a little steep though.
5
I've ordered cakes from Antoinette and the designer cakes they offer are exquisite and of high quality.
4
the cakes were terrific! its expensive but really really nice! you have to try it though, its just beside the hotel we stay, fragrance hotel imperial
3
Cosy cafe with a lovely interior fit for a queen. Good for tea with the girls but there is usually a long line before you can get a table as they do not take reservations. Food is overpriced and cakes are overrated.
5
very nice food, but expensive, its ok because its very delicous and fresh, and very near to hotel our stay!
4
The salted egg yolk croissant has been posted a few foodie website as the best one in Singapore so since then it has been packed. Make sure that you make a reservation upfront. They take reservations till 13:30 and after that it is all walk-in. The croissant itself was very tasty, it had a flaky texture but a good butter taste. The salted egg yolk was rich and a little bit salty. They nailed it.We also tried some of their pancake with chicken and bacon, I think it was called Concourse. The pancake was thin and smooth very nice. The style of the restaurant is a bit barok
3
I went to Antoinette's outlet in Softel hotel for salted egg yolk lava croissant that is highly recommended by the public recently. The boutique serves the croissant from 1 pm. Considering its limited offer each day, my friends and I arrived at 12:30 pm. At that time, only one group with 2-3 persons was ahead of us...But the result was my friends and I only got the last croissant left. Why? 1) No queue number was offered. We were asked to sit at the Xperience Cafe to wait. When the sale began, several groups rushed to the counter. 2) They only served 25-50 croissants everyday in Softel outlet, which obviously cannot meet the demand in CBD. Under this context, it might be more reasonable to cap the quantity each customer can buy. However right now, one customer usually buy 5 croissants at one time. 3) When I called Antoinette's main store, the staff said they still had some stocks on Penhas Road. Alas, why they allocated such a little quantity to its outlet? After tasting the croissant, we should thank the boutique for saving us money. One is enough! The taste is just so so though the idea (mixing Asian ingredients with Viennoiseries) is brilliant
2
o Macarons, cakes. o French. o Very classic. o Jazzy music and beautiful environment. i. Was there to meet a group of mutual friends. Had lunch, so I didn't get any cakes (not a cake person also). I just ordered a teapot of petit rose herbal tea. o Good tea. Sweet rose aroma. x Horrible service. None of the waitresses smiled. She threw the coasters on the table before setting the teapot down . I believe I can consider that rude. :(x The washroom has NO signs at all! When I asked the waitress, she responded with frustration (roll of an eye) and said, "Just open the door."I would have liked this place and enjoyed the cakes; however, due to this incident, I will never step foot in this restaurant again. For the amount of money you pay for the tea and entrées, you'd expect some decent services. x Huge disappointment.
4
Came in for lunch. Was early. Thought that my colleague had made a reservation but was sternly told by a male staff that the restaurant has no reservation policy.All was well when a young & enthusiastic female waitstaff quickly ushered me to an empty table & offered the menu.We ordered Salade Antoinette (crab meat, boiled egg, yuzu dressing, tomatoes, pine nuts, toasted brioche & mixed greens), $17: simple, fresh, healthy. Brioche pieces were not toasted. Crab Pomodoro (pappardelle sautéed w white wine tomato sauce, herbs, chilling, crab meat, clan broth), $26: tasty, slight spicy. Wish there was more crab meat.Wagyu Agnolotti (filled w ricotta & Parmigiano, tossed w Wagyu beef ragout), $28: sumptuous & scrumptious! Wish there was more on the plate!Long black coffeeNougat one sweet crepes (filled w Nutella, salty caramel, caramelised filo, nougatine ice cream, vanilla cream chantilly), $18: fantastic ice cream, crepes r a little too sweet. Luckily 2 of us shared a portion.Attentive wait staff, tastefully dressed & recommended well. Appreciated her efforts. Wished that I have taken down her name
3
Went for breakfast as next door to the hotel. Service indifferent. had the breakfast. overpriced but nice pastries. Forgettable tough skinned saveloy type thing, nicely cooked eggs and lovely thick bread toast. Coffee ok...very french. Dont ask for tomato ketchp unless you want to offend someone! Oh and the comfiest restaurant chairs ever
4
Looking for a great dessert and nice coffee in singapore, Antionettes cafe is a good place to start.
Service a little slow and maybe pricy for some.
2
I just wanted to have desserts and tea. I was impressed by the list of tea selection. I placed my order for Moulin Rouge as it had rose flavour with ginger. What I got was a clear looking tea and even water in Singapore has more taste than that. I was told that I had to wait till the tea bag was infused with the hot water (oh I didn't know that). Thank you for sharing. Seriously $9 for that pot and informing the customers that we don't add after the tea is finished is ridiculous. I think there is a difference between cheapo & money minded. Why not? The rose dimah tea which I can buy at supermarkets has more taste. Seriously? My Nutella crepe was good but the Nutella a key ingredient (it is called Nutella crepe) was so thinly spread. Sigh! Must be cost saving for rental in mandarin gallery is expensive.
5
~our colleagues had desserts after lunch here with tea, a nice quiet cosy corner of Singapore~the cakes are perfectly rich and a bit higher priced but if you managed to have a seat you could spend a few hours here catching up with friends :
3
since we were staying at the hotel beside, we always happen to see this shop, and seeing those display of cakes makes me and my wife curious, we go in and tried some slices of cakes, it was good but quite expensive coz the servings are small, but nevertheless it was good
4
We just stayed there recently. The location is just under 10 minutes walk from MRT station. Do try the french cafe Antoinette, listed by CNN as 5 best Singapore high teas, next to the hotel. Just walk through the cafe door and you’ll feel like you’ve gone from Lavender to France! Each macaron, cake, croissant, dessert, pancake, crêpes, eggs and other enticing french cuisines & all day breakfast at Antoinette is a little masterpiece of assembly and design! Do not need to worry about food if you stay here as they will be aplenty. We came around 11am at the hotel and was greeted really warmly. We were traveling in a group of four people and booked two non smoking rooms. The amenities of the room was standard basic, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a little cramped.The check in/out went really smooth. We recommend this hotel and will definitely come back in the future
5
we have tried this restaurant few eeks ago as we always see a lot of people eating, out of curiousity we have tried their cakes, it may be expensive but surprisingly was very nice, specially the chocolate cake, me and my girlfriend were very satisfied the desserts, expensive but very nice
4
Nice ambiance and excellent dessert. Food was good though dessert was better.We had Country Style Mushroom Soup which the kids loved, especially with the bread that accompanied it. Seafood Aglio Olio was really spicy. We found out later that we could have asked for the non-spicy version, which we were not informed when we asked when ordering. In fact, we were told that it was not spicy. In the end, the kids could not take it. Gnocchi Carbonara was rich and lovely. Concorde was yummy but not filling and perhaps a little pricey at $22++ per serving. Kids loved the desserts and we should be back for more. We were there with our 6 & 7 year old, but they aren't the run-around-the restaurant kind of kids. Families with rowdy or noisy kids (or teens) may feel out of place here

This is place is run by renowned local dessert chef, chef Pang and has the magic touch of chef Pang in the food offered. Even drinks offered in the menu are different from usual cafes in Singapore. Won't be the cheapest café to be in, but if you want to have quality ingredients coupled with creativity, this is the place to go.

This is my first n my last time coming to this littke cafe at 30 peng a rd Singapore. First they got my tea order wrong then came late. Halfway thru my tea the waiter came to tell me that i need to leave as they r gonna do their cashier paperwork. I guess in Singapore the waiting staff really need to b trained properly. Mannerisms is so poor. Serve without a smile. The only consolation is the cake here is actually pretty good. If u anyone wanna go to a nice place. Please stay away from this expensive n yet no service cafe.

We went for Sunday breakfast at Antioinette Cafe. It is very close to the Lavendar metro station. The decor was really nice but a very expensive place . The service was not very great. The portion size of the scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and toast was large but could have had the same at a local cafe for cheaper. It cost us $35 average per person for breakfast. The toilets really need a make over. The wall paper is torn and paper all over the place. Needs a good cleaning.  Wouldn't go there again just for the decor

This place has nice decor. It is actually quite out of place in the old neighbourhood.
The decor is all you get here. Food is expensive and service is rare. The servers prefer to congregate at the counter than to serve customers.
Quite a disappointment.

Came here with my business partner for a discussion, and we spent more time talking about the lovely decor and ambience.
We enjoyed the food there as well!

Nice french style restaurant with coffee, lots of sweets, decent breakfast. Not really quick and attentive service, but still ok.

The cakes are some of the best I have ever eaten - the chocolate/Earl Grey one is orgasmic, and the chocolate marshmallow meringues are huge. Our coffee was only warm and the service was slow, though very friendly.

My friend and I went there last few weeks. The decoration of Antoinette Cafe is great. It feels really French when you are sitting there. The breakfast and cakes choice are plenty. The service is quite good too.The taste of breakfast is normal whereas the price is a bit expensive. Some more, we were told the coffee machine is not working so we can not order coffee. That's a bit sad having a brunch with friend without coffee. So I mean this is a ok place to hangout with your friend afterall, if the money is not a big issue. But definitely not on my top list

My friends insisted that we should go to Antoinette because the last time they were there, they simply loved it. So I went along with their plan. Walking in, I thought the set-up was a bit tired and messy - they try to make it look a bit eclectic...but believe me, it's just messy and lack of care and attention.The food was really so-so : and not cheap either. We ended up wishing we had gone to the cherr-char stall or food court nearby instead : for a much more satisfying meal, at a fraction of the cost!The cakes were ok - again, totally over-rated and nowhere near "to die for"...and far from justifying their cost. Their macarons were nice to look - but simply too sweet - an overload of sugar, with hardly any distinctive flavour.Antoinette's saving grace : service staff were attentive and courteous, so that saved what would have otherwise been just a sad evening out..

If your looking for something new to taste, the place is a worth to try. But if you have more options, consider it. The place is just okay, the menu are just okay, and the price is kinda average to pricey based how it really good. Desserts are good. A place good for hangouts

Visited the cafe on 26 Jan 2014 for dinner with two kids.AMBIENCE & CLEANLINESSNice decor and ambience, but cafe is getting tired-looking with stains on the wall. Toilet clean but shabby and does not reflect the nice decor at restaurant. Toilet roll also not on wall and has to manually pick up from above toilet bowl.FOODWe ordered:A) Country style mushroom soup - too salty and heavy. Too much cream. Even my mushroom-soup-lover son cannot finish the soup.B) Classic French Onion soup - too peppery for my liking.C) Prawn crumble (Spagetti cooked ago olio style with anchovy crumble) - again too oily! Noodles are practically soaking in oil. Anchovy crumble also toooo salty!D) Wild Mushroom Risotto - too salty and heavy with cream. My daughter refused to eat.E) Organic Ying Yang tea - a combination of peppermint and green tea. Very fragrant and refreshing after all the salty and oily dish.PRICEOn average, we spent $34 per person (1 adult + 2 kids)SERVICEPrompt but not friendly. Obviously understaffed as was not able to get staff's attention when need something.OVERALLMy definition of a good meal is to have a good balance in taste. Whether the meal is from a foodcourt or an expensive restautant. For the price i pay at Antoinette, i am totally disappointed with their standard, With such a nice ambience, it's pity that their dishes cannot keep up to it. I would not return simply because of its ambiemce.This place is also not kids friendly as there is no plastic cutlery

I walked past this cafe recently and what struck me was the lovely ambience and cosy atmosphere. The decor was French-influenced with ornate furniture. In the cafe, a display table showcasing their Christmas take-aways were beautifully laid out. We were there during tea-time, so we ordered Antoinette's signature cake, appropriately named 'Antoinette' and the 'Strawberry Shortcake'. The cakes were light and did not feel like we were consuming calorie-laden pieces. The signature piece had the right amount of chocolate and a tinge of lemon for that added sourish flavour. It was unfortunate that we were seated next to a table of 15 or so, most of whom were obliviously that there were other patrons in the cafe.Overall, a nice place to hang out on a lazy afternoon

Was there for breakfast. Food and coffe is good. Did not open on time. Was abt to leave when we caught their attention to open up. Service was worse than borderline. Very inattentive and plate-pushing type service. But i would go back there for their cakes - they looked yumm

Such a quaint, interesting, hidden little cafe. I love the concept and the food. The service was also very good.

only had coffe with a friend but is obviously classy. The food looked good but as we were there between meals, chose not to eat

Went for a Sunday brunch and restaurant was operating at almost full capacity with only 4 wait staff. In all fairness, I must state this early in the review that there were 10 of us at our table. The place is beautifully decorated. The cakes and macaroons were displayed right next to the entrance so you get this European/Parisian feeling the moment you step in. We had made reservations so our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrive. The menu had enough foreign words to make it sound grand and interesting. The young lady who took our orders was friendly, well-groomed and had good product knowledge. She took our orders promptly and all was well. It went downhill after that. Food was slow to serve. We waited for about 10-20mins before the whole table had their food. But that's fine because we were chatting away anyway. The food was, pretty to look at, average to eat though. Then again, that's subjective. A little heavy on taste for me - too salty, too sweet. While food was served, the drinks never came. Requests to refill water was slow to fulfilled. In the end, we helped ourselves to the jugs at a corner of the restaurant. That said, the wait staff realized immediately, and politely offered a jug of water just for our table. Surprisingly, the drinks still never came even after our plates were cleared. We had to ask for our coffee and orange juice (straight out from the carton - how long does it take?). Even then, we had to wait another 10 - 15mins. It was disappointing perhaps because the restaurant looked like a fine dining area. That said, I must stress that wait staff was unnervingly polite and apologetic even. Think they too know they are understaffed

was there last night for a late dessert and basically only half an hour left to enjoy whatever we could ....and we sure did .....there were 4 of us so we tried the tea , the baguettes , the ice cream and even the crepes ....they were all very very good....we finished every single thing ordered within that half an hour ....the filipino lady staff was pretty sharp in checking the cutleries before handing em over to us .....its a nice place at a nice location ...will be back again .......

A little of Paris in Singapore. The servers were dressed in shirt, vests and black pants, which I thought was nice, BUT service still needs more training. My order wasn't put in, had to wait 20min before I realised that crepe wouldn't take that long to be prepared. This wasn't a big deal as the crepe with roasted chicken and mushroom in white sauce was FANTASTIC! Perfect for brunch. Tried their Viennese coffee with Chantilly; the latter is to die for. Cakes and macarons looked so good, unfortunately, I was too full from the main course to indulge in dessert. Will come back to probably the one in Orchard, heard the decor is amazing

I bumped into the Laduree-look-like logo as I passed Palais Renaissance in Orchard Road and decided to give it a try.The café is classy, parisian-themed décor, surely belongs to the up market category. The ambience is suitable for special dates or girlfriends tea gathering.The tea selection was extensive and the cake are crafted and decorated meticulously.The chloe macaroon and earl greay tea was my choice for the light “snack” during my afternoon. I found that the macaroons are no match to Laduree at all but perhaps the other desserts or food could redeem my not-so-delicious macaroons.Perhaps, I'll go back and try other desserts

I have not tried the food but I can attest that the macarons and the cakes are one of the tastiest we have ever tried in Singapore...I love the ambiance as well, a bit frenchy and I like the location - hidden somewhere near the Lavender Station MRT.Best for after dinner desserts or high tea

The place is great for a rainy day as it's completely indoor with almost no windows. The food is great for a brunch or for a patisserie / cake / tea / coffee time. However the only thing that spoiled my few experiences there is that the air con is way tops strong and it's really too cold inside

For full review : www.dairycream.blogspot.sgIn just 2 weeks time, it will be the Chinese new year festival when most people indulged in their bak kwa and their favourite cookies such as pineapple tarts and kueh bangkit.But for this year, I will shelve aside all baking plans and not have any self-purchase cookies in my house (unless given by some generous soul)Mandarina ($9):After leaving in room temperature for about 20min, the ultra-silky-ice-cream like milk chocolate mousse reached the perfect texture and the sweetness is cut through by the Mandarin orange custard and a pillowy dark chocolate sponge The seasonal limited edition Mandarin Orange Macaron($2.50): Unfortunately, the buttercream was anything but plain and the shell was too dry.Galette De Rois ($5 per slice) But out of all these, I like this traditional puff pastry filled with almond paste by Antoinette the best. Having tried at least 2 others( Tiong Bahru bakery and TWG) this year, this is so good that I am naming it the King of the King's cake.Why? Simply because the layers of puff pastry holds its structure and kept the air holes well trapped in between, a good sign of a well baked pastry that do not require extra baking time in the oven( which I usually do as most pastries are underbaked like a chewy rubber) What's more its the most affordable deal out of all. In conclusion, though I know these things might not appeal to traditionalists, but I'm pretty sure one would not regret trying them. Yes, they might appear sinful but I doubt they are any less sinful than what we have been eating during the festive seaso
