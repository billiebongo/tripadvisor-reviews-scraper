We've ordered from Bruno's Bistrot a couple of times and it's been fabulous pizza every time! Our favorite is the Prosciutto E Funghi.
Highly recommend!

Delicious food, wide variety, excellent service. Thanks to Bruno for the friendly chat. Very good selection of wines at affordable prices. A must "go to" place to eat in Singapore!

Bruno's has been around for several years, and maintains a steady following. The food is typically French and Italian. There's a good variety of dishes, and portions are very generous. Do try their truffle pizza.

A relative invited us to this place for dinner on a Sunday evening and we were there about 6.35pm.The waitress came with water and then disappear for a while. Had to walk to find our own menus. The waitress then realize something amiss.We had ordered 3 pizzas, a mushroom and a seafood risotto, a cream pasta, and a vongola. Overall food was decent but not the freshest seafood that came with the pasta.We decided to order an extra pizza but that took about 30 to 40mins with 2 reminders even though restaurant was not crowded.The friendly wait staff was no where to be seen and suddenly avoided all eye contact and communication knowing service was slacking. Average pricing was about $25 per plate

Came here with business friends for lunch. We order Burata and Caesar Salad for appetiizers, Lobster pasta and roast beef as main course. Excellent taste and very authentic. Reasonable price for lunch as well. Will come here again for dinner in end October.Note: Compared the other branch at Katong, this branch has better ambience

Been coming here for years and just read one of the reviewers who mistakenly mentioned that Bruno has left! Absolutely not ! He is still the owner and Chef and was there to greet us when we popped over for dinner on Thursday!. We love the latest "Plat du Jour" item - "Steak Tartare" - Hand chopped raw meat well seasoned. It was absolutely delightful. The "Smoked Scamoza with Parma Ham" was super as well. There is also a new cold truffle pasta with hokkaido scallops that patrons at the next table were devouring that look really good. Great food, good value, nice ambience, freindly staff, reasonably priced--- what else could you ask for ?

I moved into a place literally next door to this delightful little bistro and I couldn't be happier about it. Friendly staff, delicious food and beer is the criteria I look for in a place to spend part of my evening. Bruno's bistrot hits the spot on each of them. Oh, and they do a cracking breakfast as well.

I went for a weekend lunch with a friend. Service is good with a warm and responsive host. We ordered soup (tomato) plus a chicken based pasta. the soup served was thick but bland without any flavor. the pasta had too much sauce making it a gravy type of dish. the ice lemon tea was ok. overall an average fare. however i guess being located inside in the vicinity of a neighborhood makes at a place for regular visits.

Living close by, we are regular visitors to Bruno's. We cannot do a comprehensive review of the food served as to date we have always ordered the same dishes! A king prawn linguine with lobster sauce and a chicken filet with cheese and Parma ham in a tomato sauce. We have never made dessert as portions are generous. Bill is also reasonable for good quality Italian food which probably reflects the location. It has become our regular staple.

We discovered Bruno's Bistrot a few years back and have been back countless times since. It's one of the better Italian restaurants we've come across in Singapore (for the price point and location). The food is always reliably fresh and top notch. Their thin crust pizzas are good but so too are their pastas. Their crayfish linguine, aglio olio spaghetti and carbonara (opt for the fettucini) always put a smile on our faces. Their starters are just as good - we like their Ceasar Salad and truffle fries. Their meats are also pretty good. Try the Spanish Pork Chop which can be quite filling. For desserts, ask for their Banana Flambe which oddly, isn't on the menu though it should be! Service is also pretty good but because we're back so often, they know us pretty well :) There's ample seating but if you want to sit indoors (air-conditioning etc.), reservations are recommended. If not, sitting outside is fine as well. That said, the famous 818 Durians Store is just a few doors down so if you have diners who are put off by the scent, it may be better to sit indoors. (But don't worry, the scent is not pervasive and does not affect the food or ambience.)As a side-note, you may also want to check them out for brunch. Their eggs benedict are great! And, it's a nice spot to find yourself on a lazy weekend morning. But if it's too hot, then ask for an indoor seat though on all occassions we've been there for brunch, we were quite comfortable outdoors (it's shaded and there are fans) :)While there's limited street parking, you can find parking spots in the Bright Centre office blocks across the street from the restaurant. Alternatively, you can also park in one of the nearby Lorongs (streets) and take a short walk to the restaurant. Price-wise, the restaurant is not overly expensive. And, their prices (if I'm not mistaken) haven't changed much through the years. Admittedly, there are fancier Italian restaurants around but for the homely touch, great food and unpretentious atmosphere Bruno's offers, it's hard to fault them. In fact, it's been our go-to-spot for simple Italian cuisine for some time and hopefully, many years to come :
