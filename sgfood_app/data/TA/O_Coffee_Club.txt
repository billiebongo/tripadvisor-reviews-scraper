We had coffee here because this place has good coffee. Good Americano coffee and cappuccino. This place also serves healthy lunch, pastries and cakes. Nice outside seating and good service too.

Most delicious waffle with chocolate and vanilla ice cream, slopped with a fab chocolate sauce. Great coffee too

We were shopping on Orchard Road but wanted a resta nd morning coffee. This coffee shop was nicely placed on the balcony and did serve good quality coffee - however the service was poor - we waited and eventually had to go and find a waitress to serve us! Good price paid though

I went to O'Coffee Club @ Marina Square with my friends on a Sunday afternoon . We were a group of more than 15 people but we were able to get a table right away . I ordered the Iced Cube Expresso Latte and Egg Benedict with Smoked Salmon . The other people in my group ordered different types of tea , gourmet brew, Iced Double Vanilla Latte which came a scoop of ice, hot latte and their signature mud pie. I would say that the choices of coffee and tea were very wide . The Egg Benedict was slightly under-cooked but I much prefer it this way . All the past Egg Benedict were overdone or were too sour had a strong unpleasant taste of vinegar . The Egg Benedict at OCC was just very runny . Perfecto ! The Smoked Salmon was generous and the brioche was delicious! They were a little over generous with the Hollandaise sauce . I am not complaining at all as I could just scrap the sauce aside . The Iced Cube Expresso Latte was really perfect . I had a similar drink at Roast Cafe and the one that I had at OCC was almost as good . The Expresso ice cubes were in a short , medium size glass , the cold fresh milk was served separately . The serving was about 2 glasses . The drink was bitter enough (I just like it a little stronger). After adding the cold milk , the ice cubes got dissolved and I could drink the coffee. The temperature remained cold and the consistency was maintained throughout my drink . I like this drink very much ! I will let order the same drink if I go to OCC again . There were several choices for their all day breakfast menu . Many of the choices were the ubiquitous breakfast items such as pancakes, waffle , French Toast and even the Full English Breakfast . The prices were surprisingly inexpensive , ranging from $7.90 to $10.90 for the Full English Breakfast . I am so impressed . There are other food like pasta , salad and burger too . They cost more at about $15 - $19. They offered a good value 3-tier Afternoon Tea . As the set cannot be replenished, they allow customers to share . This is a thoughtful and generous way of doing business . We had already returned for the Afternoon Tea on a few occasions . I know where to go whenever I have a craving for All Day Breakfast and good coffee. I choose OCC over other cafes like Wild Honey . OCC is good value for money !

I am glad I dropped into this shop. What struck me was not just the fact that you can buy different beans as well as their house brew but you can also have your coffee brewed in different ways. A novelty for me was the siphon method. A very old method but probably lost out to other methods in this age of speed. While my kids enjoyed some lovely pastries of which they have a small but lovely collection. I waited patiently for my coffee. Very soon a pleasant and friendly waiter (rare in Singapore) came over and poured the coffee for me. I tried to go for black to get the flavour but decided to add milk as that's how I am used to it. It was a relaxing experience. After that I was able to browse through the store and the barista personally took me to the display shelves and talked to me about the different coffees. I finally decided to buy their house bean. Overall a great place to unwind and relax in.

O' Coffee "Club"............no decaf options, hmmmmmmm, not much of a coffee drinkers club!Had breakfast at the branch in Marina Square mall, #02-332F (near the Pan Pacific hotel). Had to have a hot chocolate as no decaf coffee available. Eggs Benedict, hard yolks, runny whites, served on very crunchy bread.Apparently the omelette my wife had was enjoyable, but the only reason she drank the English breakfast tea was because it was something wet, not because it was nice!Service was pleasant.My advice, walk on by, there are much better options for your morning coffee.As much as it pains me to say, do like the rest of the world does, go to Starbucks

We went there with family and ordered lots of coffee. Flat white, cappuccino, mocha frappe etc and cheesecakes. The coffee is really nice but the cheesecake is even nicer and creamier. We had 2 cheesecake but wanted to have more. Its a heavy rushed place but the seating n ambiance is nice

Casual easy going atmosphere. Food was generally good quality except the truffles fries which is probably air fried without a distinctive taste. The eggs benedict with ham was a general portion with the eggs the right balance between cooked and runny. The mushroom soup was thick and creamy, full of flavour. The plain waffle with coffee maple syrup was unremarkable. The Syphon-brewed Kenyan coffee was aromatic and deeply full-bodied - in short, perfect
