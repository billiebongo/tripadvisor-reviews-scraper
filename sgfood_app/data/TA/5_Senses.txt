Waited 30-40 minutes after order. One order came 15min prior to the other.
The burger bun was stale and crumbly. Beef patty too salty and not fresh. Fries were oily. Overall disappointing. Won't come back again.

I ordered the smoked chicken breast rice bowl ($12.90). Topped with Japanese seasonings and half boiled egg, it was lovely both in terms of sight and taste. Worth every morsel!

Chicken dishes were good. Pasta dishes inconsistent. One was very well done, another was disappointing. Not used to the quality and manner the steak was served. Service was very good. Overall, it's a place worth visiting cos they are receptive to feedback. Wishing them all the best

Tucked away on the second floor, at the rear of Bedok Point, this cafe may be a little hard to find. The menu offers a range of choices, mostly western-inspired. Ambiance is simple, cafe style, with an open concept. Service is generally prompt and unfussy, but if the place is busy, you may have to wait a little. The dishes we sampled varied from average to good. The salad nicoise was a little uninspired, but most people don't come for salads. The halibut received rave reviews, while the salmon was generally well received. Price was reasonable for the quality

Great food!! Wanted to try this place a few times but it's always packed. Variety of food is not a lot but it's unique and price is really worth. Food tasted delicious and I'll definitely be back for more. Saw people eating the lamb shank. So that's gonna be my next item. MUST TRY: Beef burger and duck pizza.

Ordered a couple of dishes with friends to share amongst ourselves. We wanted the halibut and beef cheek but they didn't have it which was quite disappointing but we went ahead to order something else.The salmon was moist and nice, not overcooked or flaky. The beef steak was a little hard to chew although medium rare maybe because of the sous vide timing and temperature and could use a little more seasoning but the sides of the dish which were baked potatoes and mixed sauteed vegetables were good. Duck confit was tender and easy to take off the bone but mash needed more seasoning especially when it was a mix of powdered and fresh potatoes. Crackling pork was good, tender not dry. The linguine with a mushroom leek cream base sauce was just like any ordinary cream based. A little too much and you'll feel a bloated sickening feeling at the tip of the throat. Nothing much about the truffle fries.Wings were crispy and the aioli sauce was really nice. Overall waiting time for food and drinks was a little long. I received my soda 10 minutes after all the food and drinks arrived. Latte and other coffee drinks was on the bitter side.

This little place in Bedok Point will stimulate your senses for certain. You know how everyone loves to find the great out of the way place that is small and unassuming but delivers on an interesting meal - this is it one of those rare gems. I have eaten at restaurants all over the world, but most of them really fall short of their reputation, not here. I have been there 4 times and every time they surprise me, even the coffee is perfect, the pasta al dente, the meat cooked exactly as ordered. Gosh - now I am hungry

A small cafe run by a group of young chefs and service staff that served up a surprisingly good meal. We tried the salmon which came with a crispy crust of skin whilst remaining moist and tender, and the burger was juicy with a good topping of sweet onions, tomatoes and cheese. The duck confit pizza was a thin crust one and was also good. The Caesar was slightly disappointing; whilst it had a generous serving of croutons, the same cannot be said for the cheese and there were no bacon bits. However for the price, we cannot complain. For dessert, we tried the waffles which was well baked and came with a big scoop of ice cream and some berries but it was not exceptional. Overall a very good meal that's good value for money in a quiet part of the mall.

Staff are friendly and the food is very good. Portions served exceed expectations for the price paid. Their ingredients are always fresh and the presentation of their food displays care and thought.Their steaks, beef cheek, truffle fries and fruikake fries are amazing. I'm not a fan of Carbonara pasta, but their version surprised me.A lovely place for gatherings with friends
