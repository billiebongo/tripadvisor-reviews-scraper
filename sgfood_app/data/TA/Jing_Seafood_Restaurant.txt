This is a once only tourist trap.Great location but very ordinary food.Very expensive for what it was,SGD 18 for a glass of c rated wine.

Great bayfront location by Fullerton overlooking Marina Bay Sands and the ligth and water show in the evening. A nice area to spend the evening. Good and tasty food to.
5
Excellent service given by the manager (forgot his name)..
I have a mixed group from different parts of the food and different dietary needs and I was given very good advice on the menu with customized cooking..
Manager was very patient to advice & recommend..

This is our favourite restaurant when we go to Singapore whether it is for dinner or just a light meal for lunch. The food is always of a high standard and the view is fantastic as well as a great place to people watch.

We had a 1.15 reservation on a Saturday. The food was pre-ordered and I must say it was delicious. However, service left a little to be desired. The waitress didn't hold onto the cover of the teapot and it kept falling off, spilling tea onto the table. As our lunch went beyond two, they rushed with the clearing of the table. I understand the restaurant has lunch hours, but they shouldn't rush diners. A nice meal was spoilt by this small mis-step in service
5
I've only ever been to the outlet at Bukit Pasoh which has since closed down. We're a family of big eaters. Great value for money all you can eat ala carte buffet if you love dim sum and seafood. Business was brisk and the family enjoyed their time there. I heard it can get quite crowded so put in a reservation to avoid disappointment. Would love to come again
2
What a disappointment... 350 sgd for 2 !!!Asked to pay before we finish eating Dumplings were mediocre... prawns of medium quality The only ok was the fish But the best thing in this place is the view in the Sands...All in all nothing can explain the pauvre abs the lousy service 
5
Reservation was easy. 7 of us. We arrived on time and we were promptly seated at the riverside. It drizzled earlier and the canopy was extended. The staff were attentive and they were monitoring the weather. The retracted the canooy slightly so that the diners had a good view of the laser light display at the Marina Bay Sands. Food was good and fantastic view

Lunch at JING Seafood, a contemporary Chinese restaurant located at One Fullerton, dishing out magnificent views of Marina Bay. Dim sums here are fresh and well executed - the Steamed Siew Mai with fish roe comes plump and juicy, and the Daily Soup of Melon & Chicken has clean flavours; but the best dish is the Seafood Hor Fun, eggy and full of wok-hei.
4
We found this place after going to One Fullerton to find somewhere for dinner and to watch light show. We got a great spot outside with a perfect view. Prawns with wasabi mayo were the dish of the night for us. Wasn't a very busy place (we were the only couple there until 2 other people arrived) but they had about 6 staff on the area. The food was nice but overly expensive for what it was.
3
I do visit here time to time whenever my friends from overseas come to Singapore.
I feel less crowded compared to other Seafood restaurant nearby.
However, price is quite high and food is delicious but not the best.
4
Not too crowded during lunch time, fast service and the view was great. Will be back again real soon!
1
The only positive thing we can say is, that the view is beautiful, that's it! The food is average and overpriced. The staff is overattentive..after every sip you make, somebody comes and wants to fill up your glass. We order a Set Meal for 5 people with a price tag of $528 when come to billing we where shocked!! They charge on top of bill $9.60 for the tibits & towel (napkins) 4 x bottle of water at $12.00ea which is $48.00 then there is 7% GST charge ($45.09) and lastly 10% Serv Charge $58.56.That come to $689.25 total.There are a lot of places in Singapore where you can get much better food then here. Not recommed to eat here
3
The sea was beautiful, along with the laser shows but the restaurant experience was something else. The food was ok, the service was patchy - some better than others but the shock was when we were refused warm water - 'only bottled water - still or sparkling'. We looked at the sea, looked at the waiter and shook our heads for bottled water. Then the aftershock came - $24 for 2 medium sized bottles of water :(
1
Well I don't know how to say this, but this was animal cruelty on display! While eating you could see the fish on display in the fish tanks, you could see they were stressed and that they wasn't okey and had scares. I pointed it out to one of the waiters and she just didn't care because they were going to be eaten so I shouldn't worry about the fish well beeing!!! Hmmm!!! Even though the animals is going to be eaten they should be in a non stressfull envoriment, not in small tanks on display!!! Even fish are living creatures and should be handled with more respect than this!!! I was so chocket about the tanks and the fish that I couldn't eat my food. I think this should be reported for cruel animal abuse!...We even saw how they catched the fish and how the other fish in the tanks knocked their heads against the glass :'(Another thing you have to be aware of is that they offers you a bowl of nuts, and then make you pay for it, even though you haven't ordered it...I wont recoment this place for animal lovers, and I wont set my foot here again before the fish has better conditions..
3
I am a loyal customer for Jing since their commencement of business. My favorite dish is Crab Mee Hoon which I think is the best in Singapore despite the higher price as compared to other restaurant offering the same dish. However, I was very much disappointed that on 8th August, just a day before Singapore National Day, I was having dinner with my family, I ordered the same dish as usual, but this time the dish was a complete failure, because the crab meat was soft and tasteless. My good impression for Jing is gone and I doubt I will go back again
4
We wanted to have a late lunch before leaving for the airport and we were noticeably the last couple in the restaurant, which was a bit of a problem for the serving staff who obviously wanted to close for the afternoon, but having eaten our lunch, we took our wine outside and drank it at our leisure in front of the beautiful bay...The soft shell crab is one of the best we've tried, and that (plus the friendly waiters coping with last minute guests) deserves the 4 stars
4
Good food with nice view which mbs. Perfect spot to watch the lightshow. Remember to bring jacket or cardigan if you wear sexy dress because its outdoor area & sometimes windy on night. Bit pricey for set menu but worth enough if you can eat lo
4
Perfect for romantic dinner with partner. Right across the mbs so we get best seat to watch the light show poin plus are they also have gluten free food & vegetarian food which sometimes difficult to find it together in one place.love their vegetarian food especially the set menu..7dishes for 1perso
3
Great location on Marina Bay. The chilli crab was delicious and service was very good. The view overlooking Marina Bay in the evening with the light show was great. The bill at the end was a surprise so you may want to check prices before you order
3
Not a bad cafe to have lunch and dinner. Go for lobsters or fish, ask to prepare them just grilled or steamed, it will taste better.
Nothing's spectacular though.
5
This is a wonderful restaurant. Great location and views, definitely eat on the terrace if you can. Food is excellent, we had the Chili Crab.
4
A good place to celebrate with great view over the Marina Bay. We managed to catch the light show at 8pm. The food is delicious with attentive staff. The price though is quite expensive for Singaporean standard.
3
Good clean food, beautiful location.
Only complaint no toilet facilities you have to use shared facilities.
Check your bill - we had a couple of items on the bill we did not have
4
The reason why we picked up this restaurant is because of its beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands. It is a picture perfect spot. Got to warn you though that food is a bit pricey. You can either choose to dine out - over-looking MBS or dine in at an air conditioned room. They have a wide selection of Chinese dishes.Their tables are eye catching . Each table was covered with a clean, white mantle. It made it stand out from the rest of the restaurants along its line. As soon as you sit, a food attendant serves you mix nuts. The service is good. Well, it is often said, " You get what you pay for.
4
I recommend to go there with 5+ and order their set menu. Price is a bit high (ard SGD100/pax) but with the service and view, it has value.The food can be not so special to locals, but looks quite special to expats.Last time, even sit inside I felt a bit hot but recently (maybe they fix air-con?) it was nice
5
I have had very high regard for the Majestic Restaurant since a memorable visit there a few years ago, and had been hoping to go back ever since. When I realised that Jing at One Fullerton was under the same management/ownership as that of Majestic Restaurant, I sought an opportunity to try out their weekend buffet lunch. To be honest, I had initially anticipated that the quality of the food would not be up to the standards of Majestic Restaurant, given the price of the buffet lunch relative to other Chinese restaurants ($48++), as well as the very prime location of Jing (One Fullerton). I was extremely pleased to find my expectations wildly exceeded where quality and variety of the food was concerned. I think this experience may have spoilt us for other Chinese restaurants! Every dish was remarkable. Our meal included one serving per table of chilli crab and deep fried fish, as well as individual desserts and soups. The crab was served without the shell so that we did not have to break the shell apart ourselves. This dish is highly recommended.​​We were also very pleased with the service at the restaurant. My guests and I remarked that the waiters were polite and professional, and extremely attentive. They were able to give us very helpful suggestions on what to order, and our tea cups were very quickly refilled by the wait staff. I do not think I have been to any restaurant where the waiters have been as helpful and attentive.Jing Restaurant is also right across the bay from Marina Bay Sands, and one could easily be forgiven for thinking that such a well-situated establishment would skimp on the quality of food and/or service, while charging an exorbitant premium. This could not be further from the truth where Jing Restaurant is concerned​. ​It is very surprising that the restaurant was quite empty at the time of our visit given the price, location and the standards of service and quality of the food. I certainly look forward to returning to this restaurant in the future, and recommend anyone looking for a memorable meal at a Chinese restaurant to try Jing Restaurant out
3
I have been to Jing Seafood a few times for their weekend a la carte brunch buffet, which were thoroughly enjoyed by my family.But this time was a business lunch, and the ambience was not too pleasant as it was fully packed and noisy during the peak Chinese New Year Lo Hei lunch season.Although Jing Seafood provided us with a private dining room, the sliding door was too flimsy to keep out the noise, and the table next door and main dining hall were rather boisterous.Food wise, rather common but classic dishes were served. Nevertheless, the quality of their fare was good, and the portions were generous.Recommended if one would like to try Chinese style seafood at One Fullerton which provides a nice view of the beautiful Marina Bay area.Service was efficient, but could have been more attentive and friendly
5
We visited this restaurant as a part of the Chinese New Year celebrations in a very large group booking. The layout and ambiance of the restaurant tend towards the modern whilst retaining the heritage it needs as a Chinese Venue. It is attached, and is part of, the Fullerton Hotel. Older readers will remember when this building used to be the General Post Office. We had a number of large tables well spaced throughout the restaurant. This did not in any way dilute the quality of the service and the food. Particularly memorable was the whole cooked fish in a ginger sauce. Delicious. The food was hot and well presented. Drinks were topped up regularly and the staff happily posed for photographs with the diners. We shall definitely return on another occasion. It is one of the best Chinese restaurant we have had the pleasure of visiting. If you live in Singapore, or you are planning a visit add it to your list. You may also enjoy the view across the bay, from the outdoor tables, and watch the laser show that happens twice nightly from the Marina Bay Sands complex.
4
My first dim sum meal in Singapore, and I enjoyed it. The service is very attentive, perhaps too much so, a waiter was hovering over you all the time, may be a matter of preference. I'd definitely go back not least due to the location. The veggie dim sum/dumpling was a bit bland I must say
4
Great view of Marina Bay Sands! Skipped the seafood and went for pork wich turned out to be amazing!
This restaurant is quite expensive!
4
Although it is a chinese restaurant, the food prepared has a fusion touch. It works well if you have expat or guests who are not too keen for chinese food.
4
Been here for few times.
Their set menus are a bit pricey but good combinations of dishes.
Food amount is big enough to order 4 sets to share with 5 adults.
3
Food is ok... nothing spectacular. Just like other good sea food restaurant. The staff are friendly, very lively people. Other than that, the view is superb. Not a bad place to visit for business group dinner.
4
Right on the Marina Bay waterfront looking at the stunning Marina Bay Sands, this contemporary Chinese restaurant is a great choice for dinner with a view. The food is amazing, mostly seafood but there is choice other than seafood.
5
Always came this place for dim sum during lunch. Service is great and food doesn't disappoint. Would come again!

My wife and I arrived after a long flight. We wanted to a have a light meal for dinner on the bay. Not too far from the Merlion we found a great asian seafood restaurant. The meal we had was delicous!We ordered two appetizers that were excellent. We had the fried squid. It was very tender and was fried delicately. The second dish we had was the pork and it was outstanding. We highly recommend both dishes, especially the pork.The location of the restaurant is excellent. Right on the bay; we were in a great spot to see the nightly light show (started at 9:30pm). We were also fortunate that the moon was just rising. A beautiful orange moon, rising between the ferris wheel and the lotus. The service was excellent. They were all very attentive and provided fast, great service. The restuarant manager, Jamie, was great. We ordered the pork because of his recommendation.We had a wonderful evening
1
I've eaten at Jing a dozen or so times but haven't been for a few months. The standard has dropped precipitously and the service with it. Tasteless xiao long bao, dry chicken and soggy rice to babe a few of the offenders. It was a good and reliable venue in its time. Now the best thing about it is the view - which is free..
2
Visited here after watching the light show. The view is excellent as the location is lovely. Food was poor, lamb was greasy, I ordered the chilli chicken which was tasteless and bland when the bill came realised that it was actually the wrong dish and I had been given oyster chicken. Also make sure you stress the size of portion you want otherwise you will automatically get a larger more expensive portion. Service was not very friendly either. I won't be returnin
4
Jing seafood is a full fledge Chinese restaurant with indoor, outdoor and also private room seating. Its outdoor area commands a fabulous view of the Marina Bay Sands area and also great for photography.It's lunch set menu showcases many cuisine- crabs, Peking duck, noodles, steam fish, braised chicken, and dessert. Service and food is attentive
4
we love the food. the food's yummy and enjoyed al fresco sitting with my family. I will go back again.
4
The place deserves a visit at least for the fabulous view on the marina bay. It is pricey but the food is good and the service fast and accurate. Pity the set menus are not made for single clients.
3
should improve food quality, in term of the hotness and taste.
vegetables over cook
Beijing Duck fried with flour is tasteless, cold and hard
BBQ wagyu beef is cold when serve
4
The lunch dim sum weekend is good and affordable despite having a nice view of the Marina Bay. The Chinese food is also of reasonable quality
5
On Marina Bay. Great dishes, especially soft shell crabs. Sat outside. Good service. Good view of light show across bay (not overwhelming but nice sidelight).
4
We walked past a number of restaurants looking for somewhere to eat and ended up plumping for this one. We were extremely lucky to get a table overlooking the Marina bay and therefore the light show which happens a couple of times every night. We were swift to order food, which was tasty and hot when it arrived. The waiter missed one of the rice orders but wasn't an issue as we'd already got plenty. Would recommend if you want somewhere to eat and watch the bay with decent food
3
The restaurant is nestled at One Fullerton with perfect view of Singapore River, Marina Bay Sands & the CBD. The atmosphere is perfect. Food wise, though exquisite, is quite pricey. We went there in a family of 6, ordered kung po chicken, pork ribs, strawberry fish slices, wasabi mayo prawn, spinach in superior soup, fish roe seafood fried rice & seafood noodle. Total damage is $399+.They taste fine (rather salty to my taste bud) but I guess it pays to enjoy them in such a pretty environment. Didn't order whole fish or crab or lobster or geoduck (their specialty) as they cost a lot! Notice they've the rare "forget me not" fish from Sarawak swimming in the tank. Was told that it costs $800 per kg (not sure whether I heard it correctly)! Curious to try one day, when I've save up that extra cash
2
Incredibly rushed for an Â£80+ meal. We were served and kicked out in less than an hour. The chicken wasn't cooked and when I challenged them, the chef assured us that it was okay. Clearly it wasn't as who the hell would eat bloody pink chicken the day before a long flight. Excellent spot however, shame about everything else
4
On our first night in Singapore we told the concierge at Raffles hotel that we wanted to eat the famous Singapore chilli crab! Taking into consideration that this was our first time in Singapore he recommended Jing Seafood.We arrived to a bustling waterfront restaurant (similar to all touristy spots always located on the water but we didn't mind as the view over the marina was lovely. We were promptly seated thanks to our concierge booking for us, and ordered the crab. The service was quick, sharp and hasty, which is not unfamiliar with many Chinese restaurants back home. The restaurant is not overly fancy however the guests were mostly locals and expat business people having dinner, so I took that as a relatively positive sign.The crab was the juiciest and biggest crab I have ever seen or eaten! It was melt in your mouth, sticky fun eating and every bit was delicious. We ordered a side of steamed greens and rice and that was plenty, add a ice cold beer and it was a very satisfying experience. I am sure that there are other restaurants that serve the famous Singapore chilli crab, however considering we only had 3 days in Singapore and this came on the recommendation of Raffles Hotel, I would say that I was very satisfied and would happily dine there again. My partner was there for work and we travelled June 201
5
First visit to Jing during a business visit in July. Jing has a rotating dining area near the bay that caters to upscale dining. As expected the set menu was outstanding with magnificent presentations. The service was great as they explained each course of the meal and very attentive. The only distraction was the noise coming from the floor rotation mechanism as it was in dire need of maintenance
4
Delightful modern Chinese cuisine and local seafood to be enjoyed with a lovely view of Marina Bay Sands.
3
We had the set menu and was ok but not the best I've had in the past and cheap either. Fast and efficient service. View of the bay and light show is perfect.
4
Came here for brunch with my family on a Sunday noon. Though the dim sum selection was limited but it was very good. Quality food!
3
Nice view, and the food was good as well. However the service is not very good, and the prices are far to high.
4
a very spicial restuarnt with very unusual view and menu
the food very delicios and taste
the price is very expensive
4
First, location was great...just on the water over looking Marina Bay. After a business meeting we went for a tasting menu that was incredible. First, the number of courses of food was ridiculous. And the favors were just delicious...ranging from dim sum to chilli crap, it was just a lot if food so come hungry
1
we booked a table of 10 paxs last month at jing seafood the sevices was average and the food was average aswell but there was always a sevice crews when we raise our hand and I was thinking how they can maintain the hight cost in Singapore . I think you have to pay a very hight price to have a location there 
4
We splashed a bit at this fancy restaurant overlooking the amazing waterway in singapore. Tried to order king crab but got told they didnt have any. The foods were nicely cooked and prepared no doubt but doesnt have any superior quality over other normal priced seafood restaurants in Singapore. We spent $210 for two people there including drinks and desserts. It would only be for a one off occasion ever.
4
So there is open air area opposite marina bay sands so during dinner we could watch the night shows. Service was excellent because we got additional dessert and ice cream for the kids. Local favorites such as drunken prawns, black pepper crab - all very good food: but price seemed expensive compared to similar restaurants with similar food.
3
Restaurant is ok for a business dinner with a great view of all the Singapore icons at your footstep. Good to take a group photo with the Marina Bay back drop as this will be a lasting memory... Food is not bad... Not great but not bad..
2
We ordered a party set at S$248++ for 4 pax, the vegetables were bland, the taste of the minced ginger was too strong, killing the taste of the fish. The lobster meat for the lobster noodles was non-existent and too salty.
4
Love the food and the Pvt room ideal for pvt business meeting and close door discussion the food makes the guest happy and we all love it
5
Food was not bad although not fantastic. We had the ala cart buffet brunch on Mother's day. Very worth the $$. The waitering staff were very polite & helpful from the start to when we left. Good job and keep it up!
1
Be careful if you visit this restaurant as prices are not listed. 4 prawns $68.00
Ridiculous prices and poor service.
3
The restaurant has prime position if you wish to sit and watch the laser light show in Marina Bay during the evening. The situation is perfect and a lovely way to relax and soak in the atmosphere of this fabulous city in the evening. The staff are friendly and helpful. Contrary to other reviews our food was delicious, served hot and had plenty of taste. It was pricey but you are eating in a prime location
1
the staffs were friendly and helpful but I find that their dishes were way overpriced given that the presentation and cooking skills are no difference to a normal restaurant we always patronise. moreover, the billing was wrongly key by another 100plus which I wasn't pleased when we saw the extravagant amount. I wont recommend my friend.
2
The only thing I found here was a great view. The location is perfect and you want to be here at least for a while. But you get dissapointed when it comes to paying the bill. I ordered only one beer. Nobody told me it would be the can, not a draught. The price I paid for this small can of Tiger beer was really surprising - 18 $. I must say this was the most expensive beer I have ever had. The staff was nice but It would be nice to see the prices before you order. Then it would be your decision if you want to pay the price for the nice view. This was a trap
1
We used to take visitors and guests to this restaurant because of the view and fine food. However, the quality, service and presentation has deteriorated markedly to the point that the place is not recognisable if not for the views. The only thing that didn't change was the price. So you end up paying a lot (85$ per head) for really mediocre food. It was terribly disappointing and embarrassing for us as we told our business visitors to expect a treat. Never again
3
My wife and I were staying at The Fullerton Bay Hotel thought we'd try a different restaurant in the same area . I ordered x 1 chilli prawns and x 1 chilli crab the waiter brought out a small plate of nuts while we enjoyed a pre dinner drink . When our meals arrived x2 small rolls were brought out as well , I thought nothing of it . When I paid for the meal I found out they charged me $4 for the nuts and $3 for bread rolls I'd say we're 4cm x 4 cm big . Ok the price was only $7 as we were staying at The Fullerton Bay we weren't on a shoe string budget I just thought that was under handed charging me for those 2 small items considering I was charged $171 for the chilli crab and $52 for prawns x 2 rolls and a small plate of nuts should be complimentary . The food was nice nothing over the top if I was to compare it to The Fullerton Bay or any other place I ate at in Singapore it's overpriced .
3
At night when the light show is in full blast there is no better place to be than sitting outside at Jing. Typical great Chinese service. The food is only ok and for a waterfront restaurant surprisingly the meat is better than fish. Try the steak in pepper black bean sauce. You will pay for the view
4
The location is perfect for an evening watching the bay and the lightshow. It's pricy but the food is good, we had chili crabs and a couple of fish
5
It tasted unique especially the cereal prawns. The crabs were good and the seafood were very fresh and springy
4
The view is very good which oversees the Marina Bay. Service is very good too. Price is quite expensive though considering the food is quite normal.
3
Lobster you can definitely get cheaper, even in Singapore. Service was ok, not really motivated. The location close to Fullerton and directly at Marina Bay is quite good.
5
Had a wonderful evening on the bay watching light show. The menu was designed for our needs both gastronomic and financial. 6 of us ate really well and had a thoroughly good evening.
4
Great food. Average ambience. Moment of lapse led to poor service rating. The service staff was extremely careless when clearing the used finger bowl and spilt the dirty water onto my wife's handbag.
1
The only positive thing we can say is, that the view is beautiful, that's it! The food is average and overpriced. The staff is overattentive..after every sip you make, somebody comes and wants to fill up your glass. For a soup, springrolls, noodles and scallops 2 beers, 1/2 bottle of water ( I wanted a glass, nobody told me that I've to order half a liter) we payed 180$ !!! There are a lot of places in Singapore where you can get much better food then here. After the last bit, the table was cleared and the bill came without asking.. although the restaurant was almost empty on a Friday evening, we felt thrown out.. never again
4
My friends and I enjoyed the food yesterday. The service was excellent even though few itemes ran out due to busy x mas dinner, but a chinese male manager offered us some itemes twice which only can order once on menu. All the staffs were very nice and friendly. We all had great time at Jing restaurant and will be definitely visit at Jing next time.
5
There are thousands of restaurants in Singapore. Unfamiliar with Singapore, it was daunting to find a restaurant for a business evening dinner with a fixed budget that met the hope of fantastic food, fabulous location and great service. We wandered down to Marina Bay and found this wonderful restaurant opposite the Marina Bay Sands Hotel with spectacular outdoor (and indoor) bayside tables and a perfect view of the 8pm laser light show across the bay. The head waiter understood our budget perfectly and ensured we had a feast of Singaporean/Chinese dishes brought to us swiftly. All 6 of us had a wonderful, relaxed evening. An unexpected treat.I left a favourite item of clothing behind and when I called the next day the staff had carefully kept this for me. Relieved and delighted yet again by the kindness and genuine nature of the team at Jing. Do go
2
The location is pretty much perfect as you are right on the marina overlooking the marina bay sands and have a front row seat of the water and laser show at 8:30pm.The food quality is okay but to be honest the hawker food outlets around Singapore can give you pretty much same quality at a fraction of the price. This restaurant is so over priced it's not funny especially if you are on the NZ dollar.In Auckland on the waterfront you'd get 5+ star quality meal with all the trimmings for less than what we paid for a set menu of the following:Fried squid started and 1 wonton with garnish Chilli crab claw x 1 and chilli saucePork belly x 1 with chilli sauceKing prawn x 1 with egg noodlesSmall soup with another king prawn, no vegetables anywhere and then Jelly and sorbet.All of this for $98 Singapore each person plus tax and restaurant surcharge1 x bottle of Mcguigan Australian Sav Blanc for $85 Singapore dollars plus tax and surcharge Hope you're not hungry afterwards as this meal was $375 NZ dollars!!The then had the cheek to ask for a tip on the bill.Look, food was tasty and very nice location I mean you are on the waterfront in Singapore but come on guys, really! I felt like I'd been rolled in an alley and had all my money stolen from me. Surely this is not the experience you want for your diners right?Anyway if you're desperate for a waterfront seat then eat here but yea get your chequebook out
5
The last one was the 5th time - bringing overseas guests to dine and watch the Marina Bay laser show and each time, we were provided the right seats with the nice view of the laser show.
1
Terrible terrible service, even before we got a table. Was shoved aside repeatedly just to get a table. Will never ever go there or recommend anyone there.
4
We ordered the set dinner. The six course meal was very good and was value for money. The service was friendly and courteous. While eating, we were treated to some beautiful firework display right infront of our view.
4
Nice place, the ambient is quite refined and the cuisine is what I'd describe as "fusion" between Chinese and European. If you are looking for something different it might be a place worth checking out!
4
Nothing special to shout about for the foods. But the location and view is perfect. It has some distance from the Merlion, thus not too noisy as well. Go there about 7:30pm, make your order, while waiting for the food, enjoy the 8pm laser show from Marina Sands.
2
Been there with my family at an weekday evening. Location nice: sitting outside you look over the bay to the Marina Bay Sands. But here ends the pleasant part. Service was slow, disoriented/unorganized and unfriendly to the border of rudeness. We had beef satay, crab, fried rice, a whole fish and vegetables. Fish and vegetables overcooked and without taste. Fried rice too salty (too much soy sauce?). Prices according to location rather high. SUMMARY: Absolutely not worth it
3
Jing is on Marina Bay, across the water from Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer. The outside tables have a fabulous view, of the multicolored lit buildings, the boats in the harbor. Unhappily the food is less good than the view. It isn't bad - the chilli crab was not as good as Jumbo or NoSignboard, the steamed fish OK but a tad overdone, the shrimp fine. In general the food was less good than that at the Maxwell Road Hawker Center (a romance free ambiance...) but we were there the night of fireworks in the bay, and the visual experience, rockets reflected off the glass wall of Marina Bay Sands, was magical
3
Concur with what other reviewed posted: food and service are good, but the pricing is just ridiculous. $15 for a hot & sour soup. $22 for steamed buns? All in all, we dropped about $180 for an okish Peking duck, a wasabi prawn appetizer, a tofu dish and some fried noodles. Barring the usual attempt to oversell sparkling or still water, the staff was courteous and prompt
5
Excellent service in this fine dining restaurant. Unsure at first reading the menu about whether to go in. Friendly staff made some great recommendations for ordering, even our fussy 7 year old was happy and or ding seconds of the delicious sweet and sour fish. Nice atmosphere and views, and the waiter took a lovely family photo for us. Price was very reasonable, particularly give n how much we ordered :
3
Nice place to bring oversea guest especially if you need a place for leisure dinner. View is good. Overseeing a Marina Bay waterfront with laser light show at 8 pm. Chicken with Indian spices comes with a tint of turmeric and just nice to go with beer. Grilled prawn with salt let you taste the original taste of sweetness. Grilled snapper on banana leaves is about right . Black Pepper crab is not as good as other local famous restaurants as it has sweet tint. Overall is acceptable
3
Tired and hungry and wanting a feed after 8.30 without waiting for a table we moved to this restaurant. Food was good but you get charged for everything without you knowing. Service very average and price was very expensive.
3
The place is located on the bay and it has its own cost. You can enjoy the view of merlion park and marina bay hotel .. You can enjoy the laser show and other things .. although food was just OK , not very good ..

Good place to go if you want view of the Marina and laser show (which ended up being a bit meh). Worst place to go if you want a value-for-money Chinese feed. The menu was long and involved and for some reason most fish dishes were only served in 1 kilogram portions for over $100. We stayed away from the $65+ dishes so I can't comment on the quality of the seafood in those, but for $40 you'd expect a bit more than 3 prawns and some unidentifiable seafood strips in a "yellow noodles with seafood" dish, that's for sure.And I know alcohol is pricey here but $15 for a small bottle of Tiger beer is having a laugh, surely.The food was OK, not great by any standards. In fact, we left saying that was the worst chinese meal we'd had for that kind of money. Next time we'll forego the view and hit up a hawkers market which I'm certain would have the same standard of fare for a tenth of the price

We had a very poor meal in this restaurant. We chose it primarily because of its setting overlooking Marina Bay which was wonderful and we were able to watch (the rather disappointing) laser light display while we ate. We decided to have the fixed menu for 2 as it offered a chilli crab claw as one of the courses which we wanted to try. The meal was really disappointing and grossly overpriced. The service was acceptable but not good and the cutlery didn't even look clean we had to ask for napkins

On a surprisingly wet evening we went into Jings for dinner, the restaurant was moderately busy but we got a reasonable table outside under the canopies. We chose a combination menu for two involving about 5 courses. The food was very tasty and delivered without due haste so we could enjoy it at an appropriate pace. Most things in Singapore are expensive but I thought the food was reasonably priced, however the cost of the wine was a little eye watering and the measures that were poured were mean to put it mildly. Service was pretty good and there were excellent views of the evening laser show over the bay. By that time the rain had stopped and so the canopies were pulled back for us all to have an even better view

After arriving in Singapore early in the morning we decided to go out for lunch. We were recommended to go to No. 1 Fullerton but unfortunately we chose to eat at the Jing. We had a small chilli crab which was very good but when we were presented with the bill it was $135 plus tax and service charge. We had a bottle of water and two small glasses of wine. The total bill was $220. We thought this was extortionate and would recommend anyone to visit the Boat Quay for lunch where there is much more competition and the prices are much more reasonable

the food is very good and typical from Singapore. We had a good Chili Crab and (for our surprise, as we were not aware of having ordered this) a tiger fish.Location is the best in Fullerton Bay to watch the laser light show in the evening.The issue is the price, we paid 351 $, and the feeling they tried to squeeze us to increase the pric

Awesome location and we chose it for our anniversary dinner as we wanted something special and to have a great view of the light show from Marina Bay Sands. Well we got the great view of the light show but that was about it. The service was average and the staff seemed more interested in pushing the overpriced drinks on us than actually giving us good service.The food was also average and so overpriced it was ridiculous. Worst part was the people at the next table eating a lobster that was still moving!! I like my food fresh but that is just barbaric and it turned us right off what was a very plain and underwhelming meal and we left with only half the meal eaten.There are so many great places to eat in Singapore. Don't waste your money on this place

Booked to eat and see the marina bay sands light show. Great location for that. Food ok but not good value for money. When they served our meals they asked if we would like rice with it . A huge bowl of fried rice came. Way over the top and we got charged 28 s dollars for it on the bill. We we offered water and 2 glasses cost $10 . Both without telling us a cost was involved. Be wary. Also caution if watching people eat live lobster turns you off your food then don't eat here.

I've had some great meals at the Majestic Restaurant but for some reason have never had a meal which has matched it at Jing. I've eaten at Jing at least twice - more recently one evening during the week. It was pretty quiet. Not a bad meal but nothing to write home about

As others saying the selling point of this restaurant is definitely not the food, the food its junk. Also i should mention that They charge everything , even the 5 chips they bring you to pair with Beer.

After arriving late into Singapore on a Sunday evening, we walked around the esplanade, over the bridge and across to Fullerton square. The first fish restaurant we came to was heaving and it would be nearly 2 hours before we could get a table - so we moved on up to Jing. Which wasn't heaving. In fact it was only about half full. The starter was not bad. Seafood dumplings in a hot sauce. The Imperial hot & sour soup with seafood was definitely not imperial - there was barely any trace of fish . The main was dreadful: the fried yellow noodles were not so much swimming in grease as drowning in grease. Overall, for a meal that would have cost about £20 at our local takeaway, or £40 at our local Chinese at home, it cost £110. Very poor value

This place has a real mixed bag of reviews so we weren't sure what to expect. The food was very good, but over priced a small dish easily serves two so it's probably better value the more people that go. The service on the night we went was very good, efficient all night. The wine is average price for restaurants over looking the bay $88-95. I think the only annoying thing is the loud techno music from the Pelican Restaurant next door, very odd as it's not that kind of restaurant. We find that a lot in Singapore though that the music playing isn't appropriate for the restaurant. I would go again

We selected this restaurant because of its ideal location to watch the Marina Bay light show in the evening and it was a mistake ! The food was ordinary but expensive : we even had the surprise to see on the bill that we were charged $3.50 for the plate of wasabi chips that was put on the table without us ordering it . The wine was the most expensive we saw during our 7 days stay in Singapore . The restaurant did not stopped the music during the show so we had two conflicting sources of sound that we did not appreciate at all ! The service was slow at the beginning and we felt that we were rushed to leave before the start of the second show ! Overall , a bad experience

Great location especially the outside sitting which has a marvelous view of Marina Bay Sands and evening light shows. Food was good and very interesting, the rice dish is one of the best we have ever had. It is at the top end of pricey even for Singapore! Each dish, starter or entree was close to S$30 each. Our disappointment was when we got the bill. The wasabi chips, that were very good, were set on our table when we set down and of course we thought they were free, turned out to be $3.50. We were charged S$1 for a glass of cold tap water then charged for two bottles of wine when we had only one! When we complained the "manager" very quickly agreed to take the three charges off our bill after I asked to chat with the owner or manager. We have not yet checked our credit card on line to see which charge was processed but will most certainly do that tomorrow after processing. So beware of the bill and the expense but with those safe guards in place enjoy the food and ok service. Buyer Beware!

I was in Singapore for 4 days visiting family, we came straight from the airport to this restaurant for dinner. The setting is lovely - the restaurant overlooks the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which has a light show in the evening - i think it's every 1/2 hour from 8pm but don't quote me on that. The food is very good but it is very expensive. The only negative was the service... this seemed to be quite slow but it wouldn't stop us going back there. All in all a good meal ;-

Our group of friends wanted a nice restaurant with a view of the Marina Bay light show. This was certainly spectacular and the ambience of sitting outside on a balmy night watching the shows (We saw the one at 8pm and 9.30pm) was outstanding. Overall the standard of the food was excellent albeit small portions but the service was certainly lacking. We had not finished our starters when the first shared dish of the main course arrived. It had it sit there for five minutes before we were ready to start. We had ordered steamed rice with our meal but this did not arrive until well after the mains and only after we reminded the waiter that it was missing. We were not offered water and again, had to ask for it to be served. As other reviewers have commented, the cost is very high and although the food quality is good, be prepared to pay a high price
4
We didn't get much change out of $400.00 for the 6 course set menu for 2 with drinks but my goodness, it was worth every tiny morsel that came to the table! I had a mouthgasim! The view over Marina Bay is spectacular especially if you time your meal with the laser and water show from Marina Bay Sands at 8.30pm. A tip for those eating in Singapore for the first time, remember that restaurant dining is not inclusive of GST and we were slugged nearly $50.00 on top of our bill. Also, the restaurant has a little bowl of delectable wasabi chips on the table when you arrive. These are NOT complimentary

I am surprised that Jing is under the Majestic group because the food is not really fantastic compare to the other restaurants that they owned. The selling point of this restaurant is definitely not the food but the view. The prices are extremely steep compare to other Chinese restaurants. I will only recommend this for people who wants a good view of the new Singapore skyline, but if you want good food, go somewhere else

It's often a mistake to take the advice of your hotel concierge when making restaurant reservations in an unfamiliar city , it was in this case. It may have been because it was the middle of Chinese New Year celebrations that the options for individuals/couples were very limited. There were two set menus available or a la carte but this menu was small. It was a struggle to find anything one wanted to eat , although the set menus for groups of 6 - 10 + had things of interest there was no possibility of adapting them for two.Add that to the fact that the prices are stupidly high ( noodles with 4 - 6 prawns cost 35 Singapore$ ) and I would tend to avoid this place in the future
3
The food was good but very pricey and difficult to order appropriately as all the items were all meals in their own right and the aim of the restaurant is to get the bill as high as possible.Simple dishes like plain rice or vegetables were not on the menu and we had to insist we did not want the expensive rice dishes at over $30 each.We did get plain rice eventually. The prices reflect that you are on the Bay and have a view of the "free" laser show but you do pay through the prices.We were happy to do this BUT when the bill came there was the sting - they had charged us $8 for "appetisers " which we queried as we did not order them - they pointed to the 2 mandarins on the table and insisted that they were there for us. I said that this was a rip off as we did not order them or touch them - they said they were there and it was our fault if we did not eat them and we must pay - I insisted they were removed from the bill.Also they charged $2 for a glass of tap water and insisted that that was normal and we must pay - we refused and eventually with no apology and no grace theses two were taken off.This was the only bad event we had in all the many restaurants we had dined in, in Singapore.Too round this off I paid in cash and the change was given to me in all small coins.This demonstrated the worst side of this restaurant's staff and management.We were recommended by our Hotel and the concierge when we told them what had happened they were truly upset and were going to ring them.So if you eat here be aware - I believe that we were "targeted" as tourists

We booked a "reunion" set course on Chinese New Years Eve. We were a party of 8 people which cost SGD 888 for the set (they asked me to deposit SGD 300 in advance - I made the reservation about three hours earlier). With drinks, etc., the bill came out to more than SGD 1000. The set menu included: a salad with salmon that is tossed by all of the guests to wish good fortune, a lobster/crabmeat soup (taking the place of sharks fin, I presume), a smallish plate of shrimp and scallops, a dish of mushrooms and abalone (quite good, but small portions), "Kurobata Pork Chop" (very random dish), whole fish ("Soon Hock Fish")(very good but again, small). "Sri Lanka Crab" served with chili sauce. Egg noodles to finish.This is the second time I have tried this type of meal in Singapore (set menus on New Years Eve). As far as I can tell, the tradition is that these meals are really supposed to be eaten at home with families getting together and presumably one or more cooks laboring over the dishes over a course of hours or even days. The dishes have a lot of symbolism involved (good health, long life, lots of wealth) but are underwhelming in taste when made by restaurants.The restaurant itself was nothing spectacular. Typical attitude of Chinese restaurants operating during a holiday when set menus are offered - they just want you to eat promptly so they can safely initiate the next round of seating approximately an hour or two later.The views out into the marina are nice. That was about it

Few cities have a skyline as dramatic as Singapore, and the City of the Merlion has completely recreated it's waterfront vistas in the past decade. The city towers over the marina, wraps around the water like a concrete cloud and encloses the viewer in a modernistic world straight out of "Blade Runner." If you haven't been to Singapore in a few years, you gotta go!One location absolutely worth visiting is Jing, on the waterfront across the street from the majestic Fullerton Hotel. The food is better than fine; the staff well-trained; the wines highly appropriate; the menu broad and the after-glow memorable. Dining at Jing is not as good as sex, but it's getting close.My colleague and I visited Singapore in January 2014, and since it was his first visit we trundled down to the waterfront to watch the laser show. We actually didn't intend to stop and eat, but the lights were subdued, the linen tablecloths elegant, and it just seemed like the right thing to do. All of the dishes were delightful, and to sit by the harbor and watch the tourist boats and the laser show was just great fun.Yes, it's expensive. Relax. For once, it's really worth it

Business dinner for 3 with a great view - but don't be too distracted, the food is good. So, we sat outside - cool evening breeze and right smack in front of the "boat" that is the Marina Bay Sands resort. I was pleasantly surprised by the set menu - petite appertizers, great tasting soup but what gets top marks is the restaurant's version of chilly crabs (actually it was a crab claw so it wasn't messy) and the pork chop which had a hint of truffle oil. After stuffing our faces, I thought I would have problems finishing the fried rice topped with crispy anchovies. Wrong! It was so fragrant and tasty, I gobbled it up. To complete the meal, the dessert of jelly and lime ice cream was the perfect ending. I'll definitely visit again - next time with my glutton kids because they would certainly enjoy the food. The view would serve as icing on the cake

Ok, so who thinks they're paying fast food prices for fancy food and stellar views???? Really people?? We live in California, and the same principle applies, so we weren't surprised that the view was what we were primarily paying for. However, we had "hot chili crab" which was delicious. And the service was good. Overall, pleased with the experience...would visit again. Kudos Jing

You don't mind paying top prices for good service and good food but all we ended up with is OK food but appalling service. Waiters spent most of their time walking around looking at their feet to make it look like they were busy and when you actually managed to get their attention it became a battle of translation.Be warned, they charge for everything (and they know how to charge), the service is very very average and the only redeeming feature is the view of the light show
3
We read the reviews about the view and the light show. No disagreement. You'll get the view. The light show is nice...but doesn't compare to Disney or even the Bellagio fountain show in Vegas. Still, sometimes it's better not to compare and just enjoy, which is what we did while taking it in. The food at Jing was very good....but not sure worthy of the prices.
4
Surely the primary reason for choosing this restaurant is for the bay view? the chance to eat dinner looking at Marina Bay Sands and the spectacular laser show? Well, The food wasn't bad either! Those reviews which hammer the quality should think about what they are getting. The wasabi crisps on arrival were yummy, wasabi prawns for appetiser are a must and the black pepper pork very tasty. Prime location doesn't always equal the best food for your money, but the experience is everything. Dig into your wallet and enjoy
2
A superb location on the waterfront, but that's the only good point - there are several other restaurants overlooking Marina Bay. A great laser-light show from the Sands hotel. My starter was prawns - not bad actually. My main course was chili crab - a crab in a shell in a bowl of spicy soup-like substance. I'll never order that again. Messy, hardly any crab meat worth the struggle. Gave up on that. Then we got the bill - Wow
4
a former colleague took us here, so we could get a nice look at the Marina Bay Sands and the light show. we had one of the best tables in the restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed the light show. I found the service quite slow...seemed like we only saw a server if we actually flagged one down in passing. and frankly, I don't even remember what we ate, so it must not have been too remarkable. Didn't pay the bill, so not sure of the cost and whether or not it was reasonable. But location, location, location!

High-quality food, good service, great view of Marina Bay sands. However, it is far too pricey for the casual dining atmosphere of this restaurant.
3
We ate here based on it being near to our hotel. It was decent with good service but it's fairly standard quality Chinese food - nothing that you'd write home about but nothing wrong with it.
4
A very nice place to go for dinner at night...sit out at waterfront is awesome ...
The light and water show from Marina bay sands is big bonus....food and service is decent... Enjoy!

Beside good sitting arrangement, just opposite to the laser show area of the marina bay sands complex, it is an absolute rip off. With tiger beer glass at $14 and a small bowl of potato chips (complimentary amuse-bouche) charged to our bill at the end, the food was average at best. There are much better places to dine in Singapore, that's for sure..

A group of us went for lunch during the Chinese New Year season for Lo-hei. Besides the obligatory Lo-Hei yu sang (raw fish), we had wasabi prawns, xiao long bao (juicy dumplings), beef tenderloin in teriyaki sauce, pan-fried foie gras ($28 per individual portion) and green vegetables with pine nuts. Of these dishes the best was actually the yu sang, followed by the beef and vegetables. The prawns were ok although one of us thought the wasabi sauce was too strong. The foie gras was a real disappointment, coated in batter and drowning in a sweet sauce. We had to sit outside as it was full for the season, which became unbearably hot after a while. Fortunately service was quick so we could eat and then escape to an air conditioned place for dessert!! Overall, given what we paid and the quality we received, I would not go back
5
We came for the view, and got stunned by the food. For a starter we had alive lobster, and my girlfriend freaked out. Amusing for everybody :) The crisp duck was amazing, pork sweet and sour was the best we have ever had. So be it with a service around average, this was great
4
The Marina Bay was an awesome place. It could not get better than enjoying the nightly laser shows at the most perfect location and served with good food. But if you just wanted the location or views, get your Americano at Starbucks or your beer at one of the bars, surf the net and wait for the shows. It was a typical Singapore seafood joint as far as service was concerned with little formalities which I liked. If you were looking for a fine dining experience complete with waitresses in high slits cheongsams with immaculate service then this was not the place. The wine list was Ok but with Singapore pricing. The house wine was reasonable.I liked the wasabi prawns which I thought was outstanding. The chili crab was average. Accompanied by the steam bun it was perfect. The fried buns were just too oily and drowned the good taste of the chili crab sauce.We also had fried rice, succulent kailan with garlic, and beef Japanese style. The beef deserved a special mention.The bill came to SGD 500+ with the chili crab doing most of the damage. There were 5 of us with a couple of beers each and two glasses of house wine for some. So budget a SGD 100 per pax per seating for a reasonable dining experience while enjoying the shows. In this case I was entertaining my business friends from Seoul. I thought they enjoyed the evening. I did

Upon reaching, before ordering, I requested iced water which is usually offered free in Singapore's restaurants. The waitress arrived with a 750ml bottle of Acqua Panna ($10 before surcharges), without asking if we (2 adults) would have preferred a smaller bottle. The decor of the restaurant is inconsistent, one wall is decorated with an installation, the other is naked, the left side area to the entrance looks like a temporary event space. Although only 2 tables were occupied in the restaurant it took the food quite a while to arrive. The quality was good, the fish we ordered was fresh and nicely prepared. Service was mediocre, without any extra effort to make patrons happy. The bill was on the high side, so the overall verdict is "average" only. The money sent would have been worthwhile with a more attentive and friendly service in an improved surrounding

Had dinner in this restaurant after a long day at a conference. The food was so good, I forgot my diet. The presentation, smell and initial bite of every meal they brought out was enough for me to recommend anyone to return to this dining facility at the fullerton

This is a nice little restaurant at One Fullerton, just next to the stairs from the driveway. Layout - It has an indoor seating area for about 20 tables and a much larger outdoor seating area. The outdoor seating area has a very nice view of the MBS Casino Resort and the Marina Bay Reservoir. Being a hot Sunday afternoon, prudence dictates that the air conditioned seating indoors would be more appropriate. However, there must have been something wrong with the air-conditioning that day, it was rather stuffy and they had some auxillary fans stationed strategically around to circulate the air.Ambiance - Nice and subdued lighting. Shades were down on Sunday lunch because of the glaring sun. I suppose it would be nice and cozy at dinner time with the lights from the MBS and Marina Bay buildings.Service - was attentive and prompt with orders. Seemed a little short handed though. No complaints. Orders were correct and promptly delivered to the tableFood - nice selection of ala carte dishes on offer for the weekend buffet. Roasts and other starters on offer were on the buffet line with fruits and some desserts. The duck crepe (i hesitate to call it peking duck) was passable. Can't expect it to remain crispy sitting out on the buffet line. There were pig trotters with vinegar and quails eggs, quite nicely done if you like pigs trotters. There was also some strange corn salad in a kueh pie tee cup. Forget that.Soups - choice of 2 soups per table, one serving per person. The hot and sour soup was rather peppery and vinegary, just the way I like it. The shrimp dumpling soup with shimeji mushroom was pretty good as well.'One order per table' dishes - Chilli Crab (ran out of crab that day but got lobster instead!) was good. Unfortunately no man tou to dip in the sauce..... The deep fried soon hock was good. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and no muddy taste. Sharks Fin Fried Rice - this was not really what I expected. It was fried rice in a bowl with sharks Fin soup poured over it! Looked more like mui fan but it was pretty nice!Dim sum from the menu was pretty good. The beancurd skin rolls, baby abalone dim sum and other selections were all good. The soft shell crab was good as well. We also ordered the duck ramen - fried noodles with duck basically - it was nice but I should have ordered more dim sum insteadDessert - pulot hitam (black rice porridge), mango with pomelo, cut fresh fruit. It would have been better had they replenished the desserts more quickly though....All in all, a nice experience with nice food and ambiance
