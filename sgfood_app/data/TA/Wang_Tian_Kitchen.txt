One of my favorite sgd 5.50 lemon fish rice in Singapore. Combine with seafood vegetables or broccoli. So good! And i only need to wait less than 10 minutes, food is out. Fresh cooking too . ..

Good tastes good but mostly salty and with msg. Seats are limited and usually packed. Particularly hated the wok smoked smell coming from kitchen spreading towards the eating area. Clothes smelled after returning to work.

near the hospital, it is the most accessible restaurant for me as i just stay nearby. has wide variety of choices to choose from. i usually eat my dinner in this restaurant. not too crowded or noisy! the staff are very friendly and sometimes would give suggestions! they do delivery too! its just slightly expensive but im too tired of hospital food.

Nice, cosy place that serves local style hor fun, noodles, bee hoon and zi char dishes. We came during lunch and it was packed! I had the "san lou" hor fun which I found fairly tasty but I'm more used to the "dry" version- this one comes with gravy. Nevertheless, given that prices are reasonable, may come back again

We wandered into this shop one evening after visitation hours at a nearby hospital. We like the quiet ambience and clean environment. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. The staff is helpful. A good place for a meal if you want a change from what they offer at the hospital canteen
