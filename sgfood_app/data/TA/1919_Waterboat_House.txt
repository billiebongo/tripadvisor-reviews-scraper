We had the Flavours of the Fullerton 4-course dinner, and liked every dish we had. The ambiance of the place was nice, cosy and quiet, good for having some nice conversations. The severs were attentive and polite. Love the whole experience we had there.
4
We went there for our anniversary dinner, took the four-course set dinner. Satisfied with the food, one of the desserts that we tried was Sorrel, which was refreshing. Staffs also very friendly, making it so homey. Location is also quite memorable.
5
It was my mom’s birthday and I’ve only indicated that its her birthday when I made a reservation on Chope. The restaurant surprised my mom with a delicious birthday mousse! Everything was perfect!
4
Food was good with friendly staffs around to give suggestion / recommendation when needed. They are also very accommodating to my request.
5
The dinner set was definitely worth it and we were quite happy with the quality. Drooling over the $30 seafood special which I really want to try before the offer ends in Feb.
Really quiet on weeknights - only one other couple dinning.
5
Chope reservations made it so easy for me to sieve out the available dates for all restaurants. The star-ratings and reviews by fellow chope(Ers) also allowed me to identify and choose a suitable venue to celebrate Valentine’s Day with my other half. Would definitely use chope for future choping of venues ☺

Well that was a waste of an evening. We had a lovely meal here a few weeks ago but tonight was a disaster, over booked, slow, waited over an hour for the table when it was free the whole time. temporary staff who didn’t really know what was going on, not their fault. Had to explain to them how the beef was cooked. Broken Deafening, average, jazz singers piped at full volume across the harbour. Arrived early for an 8.30 booking, still waiting for appetizers at 9.15pm. Manager left early to go somewhere else. Should have read the signs when they demanded full payment up front before they would confirm the table. Greedy and average. Won’t be back in a hurry, despite the lovely view
4
Service staff were friendly and attentive. Ambiance is nice for a cosy meal as it wasn't noisy and able to chat comfortably. Food serving was slow though. Waited like 20-30mins between each serving. Not sure if it was on purpose (ie slow food style) or because it was rather packed that night. We had the Fullerton Heritage set meal and the food was generally good except for the mains which I felt was just average. Tasted my husband's ribeye steak and I thought it was on a dry side
5
Chose their festive set menu and some ala carte dishes, every dish was on point... the scallop, fish, beef was oomph, perfect... can improve on the desserts though... great ambience and service, went up to the rooftop bar to enjoy the dessert and drinks after meal... nice unblocked view over Marina ..
5
We had a truly enjoyable evening at the restaurant. Ordered the Christmas set dinner and they delivered a warm and delightful meal. The pasta had the right amount of truffle oil to compliment the crab meat and they even topped it with some caviar. Their service staff were also well trained and knew the right wine pairing for the meal. All that experience made the dinner truly memorable
5
Nice ambience, you may go to rooftop for some music & good view of night Singapore after meal.
Good food & value for money, highly recommended if you fancy French Cuisine.
4
Very good service and quality food. Suitable place for business lunch as the location is within walking distance to Raffles Place which is very convenient. I will definitely go back to this restaurant.
4
cozy place, food is good, will be back for sure. Service is good. for sure they do not cut cost for the food cost not like other restaurant these days try to save on it.
5
The food, service and environment is great! Highly recommended for celebration or event. you will not disappoint.
5
We had the festive dinner menu, and we didnt regret it! The food was fantastic, every dish was on point, and my family totally enjoyed it. Kudos to the chef and his team!Service was prompt and the staff were attentive. Will definitely be back again
5
A great surprise. Our first visit. We chose the festive dinner menu with wine pairing. My partner a change in the dessert to their popular chocolate ... And they agreed. Food was good. Pricing was not bad too. I love the whole experience, can't put my finger to any one thing in particular. Will be back with friends
2
I went there for lunch with a good friend. We opted for the set lunch: appetizer and main course with a choice of dessert or not. Appetizer was very very disappointing, it was actually more like an amuse bouche, it was so tiny it was embarrassing. We laughed. Main course we even paid S$5 extra to get some ribeye, which was relatively OK but not warm enough and definitely not special at all. We were so disappointed by then we didn't go for dessert and just had a coffee. It is also freezing inside, really over the top. We will never go here again for lunch as there are so many, I repeat so many much better price/quality places in Singapore for a good set lunch that it really makes no sense at all to visit 1919 WH once again. End of story
5
My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here last week and we had a great time. The food was delicious, especially the rib-eye steak, sea bass and truffled vermicelli pasta. The restaurant was cozy, perfect place for a romantic dinner; and I must say the service was very good.
5
What can be better for having a business lunch on Friday at 1919 Waterboat House? The service was excellent. The homemade bread was so delicious and so as the set lunch. Quantity was just nice and food quality was fantastic. I will definitely visit the place again. It's a pity that they close on Sunday as I would really want to bring my family there for dinner
5
We did not realise that it was restaurant week as we were looking forward to their usual menu but decided to give it a try anyways, as we were celebration our anniversary. The restaurant was smaller than we expected but it was cosy and perfectly intimate. The food was absolutely fantastic and the staff were highly attentive with such excellent service. Overall, we had a memorable anniversary and will definitely be coming back.
4
Went there with a group of 10 to sit on the rooftop. The bar food served is quite ok - all on the not healthy side ;-) The drinks were nice and the service prompt. All in all a nice location at the bay.
5
Order usual seafood platters for 2 pax and this is my fifth visits within 2 months, the standard remains excellent. Nothing to complain about the food quality. Also service is equally good
4
Good Dining Experience with great food for the stomach. Service staff was attentive and service was good.
5
I had a very good experience at 1919. The staff were very attentive and service was excellent. We had a glass of complimentary champagne and was given access to the rooftop. Overall fantastic!
4
The foods quality is fresh and it was served fast. Service crew Fook the effort to check if the quality met our expectation.
4
It is a great place with good 3 course meal and quite a number of choices to choose from. The food is nice and the portion is approriate.
5
Place is cozy to hangout with friends or partner. Good view and great service. Wine is awesome and price is reasonable.

Used to be my favourite dining place. They used to serve very good seabass with mushroom essence and chocolate mousse. But recently, the standard has dropped so much! Seabass was too salty, and the texture of the fish made me wonder if i was indeed served seabass. Very small portion of the mushroom essence was served and to make it worse, it was mixed with the potato puree. Btw menu states charcoal potato but it wasnâ€™t. The chocolate mousse (used to be called chocolate mountain) was very dry, and a heap of cocoa powder was dusted on it to make it worse. The chocolate mousse used to be very smooth with an intense chocolate flavour, and serving size used to be more decent too. A very disappointing visit
1
Hello 1919,I have made a lunch reservation via chope!Your restaurant was not opened when I went there for lunch this afternoon! You did not even bother to call me to inform that you are closed for F1! I bought my friend there to celebrate her birthday! It was a waste of our time to reach there and only to find out that it's not opened! Your restaurant even emailed me earlier last week to ask for the name of the birthday girl! How could you just close the restaurant without calling me! This is totally unprofessional.
5
From the first bit it was YUM. So often then the following courses struggle to get to this level. On this occasion each course was great. They tasted great. They looked great. Drinks on the roof are a great way to begin. Fro there to let your tastebuds be tickled by the kitchen is really fun. I will be bac
4
A quiet place for a peaceful dinner. Food portion is good. It was served fast. Had the seafood platter for 2 at $58. It was worth it with the variety of seafoods
5
My Gf booked this restaurant and i was sceptical at first as i prefered chinese food all along. However, the food here was amazing!
4
Food is very nice in right proportion (for ladies at least). Slightly less salt would be better. Quaint setting.
5
My tittle says it all, good daily menu, the service very attentive and was very affordable. I would definitely go back
5
Enjoyed a few drinks and some snacks here on St Patrick's Day. If you wear green you get a free beer!
Nice and quiet venue to watch the busy world of Singapore fly by.
1
One of the worst rooftop bars I've been in Singapore; calamari was not cooked properly, mojito tasted like lemon juice .... On top of that poor service. Definitely not coming back .
5
I held my wedding proposal at 1919 Waterboat House about a week ago on 1/7/17.The restaurant offered me the privacy and setting that I was looking for, as well as excellent staff who was very friendly and helped me out with my proposal.Thank you very much to Jezzle and Kader from 1919 Waterboat House for making my proposal a perfect one
5
Had a lovely evening at 1919 Waterboat House. We started with drinks at the rooftop, which has a fantastic view of the Marina Bay area, then had dinner at the restaurant. The food and ambience were great. Love that it's located in a heritage building as well
3
Went there: for a slightly formal dinnerI was expecting: elegance, high prices, good views And I found: good (but too formal) staff, high prices, no views (was inside though)+++ (PROS)- staff was attentive and they were elegant enough to leave us alone with our discussion and drinks even though we were the only ones inside- good lighting- cutlery and glassware are elegant and well kept- cheese platter presentation was great - - - (CONS)- place looks worn-out; has old-fashioned table covers (or maybe I'm too young to appreciate them"- no views from the inside- menu is too big and stands over the cutlery - wines start @ S$75++ (that is almost S$90/ 60 euro including taxes - pricey even for Singapore)- cheese itself was not as tasty as it looked (that might be just personal preference)Bottom line: If you decide to go there - at least choose the rooftop
5
Had a lovely dinner last night in 1919 Waterboat House, a charming 3 story Arte Deco annex next to the Fullerton Hotel. We went for the 3 course Singapore Dining week set menu and every dish was excellent and beautifully presented. The service was attentive without being hovering, and we had a beautiful view of the Marina Bay from the table. Walked up to the rooftop bar afterwards- fantastic 360 view of the CBD, with a lovely green tree on one side to provide some cover. Will definitely be back for after work drinks- the happy hour specials look good
5
Good and attentive service, delicious food. We had a seat by the window which looked out at Marina Bay Sands. We were there for lunch during Singapore Restaurants Week and the meal matched our expectations.
5
We came up to the rooftop bar for some happy hour drinks. You get a great view of Marina Bay Sands in the background. The drinks were great!
4
I took my wife here for her birthday. We were a bit surprised to find only one other couple dining. The ambience was nice and food good. Drinks on the roof after dinner allowed us to take in a great view.
5
We accidentally came here...just being curious about the sign downstairs.
It totally worth to climb the few stairs to the rooftop. The view to Marina Bay is awesome ! Staff is friendly, drinks served quickly and the music is nice !
5
We went to the restaurant later than our appointment time, however the Manager Kader still greeted us with a wide smile. As it was raining that day, we couldn't bring our baby stroller with us, he offered to help to get the stroller from the carpark at One Fullerton. However in order not to trouble him we rejected his offer and told him we will just carry our baby while we dine. Then the thoughtful manager suggested to use chairs to form a "baby bed" for us. We would touched by the extra service given by manager Kader and his team Vishan. They also check with us consistent to ensure we are well at all times. The food was affordable and really awesome with two complementary oysters. All in all, I am glad that I picked this restaurant. Will return and try their rooftop bar. Good job Team
4
Went here with my wife, first for drinks on the rooftop and then meal in restaurant. Lovely views over Marina and river. We were the only people in restaurant but it didn't matter. Great service. Portion sizes are small but beautifully presented. Not an issue. We had our deserts back on roof. Lovely evening
1
Such a disappointing experience. The restaurant is very pretty but the staff are not trained and the food is below cafe's standards. Extremely small portion (we had to eat at home afterwards) despite ordering the menu. Prices are ridiculously high for such a poor level of service and quality. It s too bad cause the place is lovely but clearly, there was a reason why it was empty (there was just another table occupied) on a Friday night when usually any good restaurant in Singapore are full on weekends
3
We visited this place when in Singapore for New Year's Eve gala dinner and to watch the fireworks.had a lot of hassle using bank transfer from UK to book dinner then having to use sister in laws Amex to book drinks package nearer event but thought it would be worth it as it was my 60th birthday as well.I don't think we could have had a better view of fireworks but the party itself was a bit of a non event.The people who did not have drinks package well outnumbered the ones who did so we were put upstairs on a different level from food whereas the others were on same level as food.This meant we had to go up and down a narrow staircase with plates of food,not very hygienic.Food was ok but nothing startling considering the price,drinks package was fair and went from 7-30 till 10-30 pm but the glass of champagne at midnight failed to appear,instead they tried to sell you it.As I said the party was a non event because the worst DJ I have ever heard was playing Rap music,for Gods sake it was New year,if she had played that in Scotland where we come from both her and her tapes would be in the river.We left early as did others because there was just no atmosphere.I would still say it was a good evening but it could have been a whole lot better
5
We went there to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary. We grabbed a drink on the side terrace before having our meal inside. The inside decor is very nice and elegant. The staff was very attentive, they had even printed nice Happy Birthday cards for me. They were very efficient throughout the evening. The food was incredible - from the beef tartare, the salmon tartare, to the turkey or perfectly-cooked entrecôte, everything tasted great. This is a location which for some reason is not well-known, and you wonder why, as everything was succulent and we had a fantastic evening. We will definitely be back
5
Entrée: Aux Cepes (Porcini, Creamed Leek, Truffle Essence)Main: Entrecote (Rib-eye done medium rare, Pumpkin Cremeux, Snap Peas, Garden Veggies, Bordelaise Sauce)Dessert: 1919 Chocolate (Chocolate Mountain, Casis Granite and Melon Sprouts)I'm more than happy with my choices of order. The highlight of this meal is definitely the 1919 chocolate! MUST TRY.The restaurant is small and cosy, good for intimate small group lunches/dinners
3
Cute little restaurant in front of Fllerton. Nicely located and easy to access. Wide range of foods from meat, fish to carbs equally overpriced. Do not expect too much on foods but enjoy nice view of marina with a glass of wine.
4
The food is typical for Singaporean restaurants for tourists (not so good), the service is again typical of Singapore (crappy compared to the Western standards) but the atmosphere is chill, most relaxed and the views are the best!
2
So the place had a private event so it was too noisey - couldn't even hear myself think. We went upstairs which was much better. We still had the set menu but they ran out of one starter so we had to eat what they had; the soup was cold and watery for seafood bisque. Fish main course completely forgettable. Will not be back again

My partner decided to book a reservation for our last night on holidays in Singapore. Firstly we decided to attend the Rooftop Bar for drinks prior to dinner. As soon as we arrived the waitress demanded my credit card even before we had ordered a drink or seen the menu. Then throughout the time we were there she was on her phone the entire time and other customers had to actually leave their seats to get her attention. When we went to pay the bill, they gave me someone else's credit card. Overall experience was very disappointing. The only positive here is the views (although there are much better in Singapore). We went downstairs for dinner (middle level). The place was empty. We were greeted by our waiter who was great. We decided to try the 4 course set menu. Food was average and we expected better quality for the price. Do not go here for the views cause there are none. I would not return or recommend this place
1
We made a reservation for 6 for NYE 2016 at the water boat house (costing $240 per person excluding drinks) expecting a great night with a wonderful view of the harbor and great atmosphere. However, what we received was not what we paid for. We were promised a buffet meal at the patio restaurant on the second floor followed by drinks and entertainment at the rooftop bar for the NYE countdown, instead we were greeted by unwelcoming and disorganised staff who sent us directly up to the rooftop bar on arrival. Furthermore, the staff members who greeted us on arrival repeatedly asked us whether we had paid the balance of $20 owing in bank fees for our reservation. We were left in a state of confusion as there was no food at the rooftop bar and were left to figure out after arrival, that we in fact had to walk down the flight of stairs to get to the patio restaurant for our food and walk back up the stairs at the rooftop bar to eat whilst other guests ate at the patio restaurant. We then paid a further $300 for 3 bottles of champagne and the waiters continually asked us to fill up our champagne glasses to encourage us to buy further bottles prior to midnight. Also by the time midnight arrived the rooftop bar became crowded with people who had paid a viewing fee of $80 and obstructed our view of the fireworks from the bar. We were also promised entertainment and a goody bag on the night however there was no DJ and the goody bag was a whistle and some glow sticks left on the tables at the start of the night, and the atmosphere was very flat. We also heard staff members arguing to each other on the stairs over the number of people that had been let in to view the fireworks from the rooftop bar crowding the viewing area. We left after the fireworks extremely disappointed that at a NYE event that ended up costing us nearly $300 per head was so poorly organised. A great shame considered the view was first class and the food on the night was reasonable but not great. Definitely would not recommend the Boathouse for a place to dine for future special events

I used to LOVE boathouse. Best dish was the seabass with mushroom essence. They were very generous with the mushroom essence and it paired very well with the nicely done seabass (flesh was tender and skin was crispy). They had a very special dessert, terrine, which made me return to boathouse pretty often!When they closed for renovation for a couple of months, i was waiting excitedly for it to reopen. I've been there twice since it re-opened and standards have dropped. My seabass was too hard on the outside, and the mushroom essence was pathetic. The menu mentioned charcoal potato mash which i did have on my first visit but on my 2nd visit, they served normal mash. Honestly the taste didnt differ much but...if something is to be replaced, it should have been mentioned. The saving grace was that the chocolate mountain was still pretty good, but it used to be better. The one i had yesterday appeared somewhat melted and not airy enough.Forgot to mention the wine was..cold.I hope the standard will improve.
5
We were attending a coffee event and decided to try the dinner and was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent foodI tried the ribeye and my wife had the cod and the food was excellent both in size and freshness. I think this is the best restaurant I have tried for quite awhile. Service was great too
1
We were sold an amazing New Years Eve party with a band, DJ, fantastic food and views of the Marina for quite a hefty price. What we got instead was good views of the Marina. :( the food was average to poor, service was average and there was NO party. No band or DJ. Just a playlist being played. The cherry on the cake was when the people that only payed a third of what we paid arrived and clogged the spaces with the view of the fireworks. So, us that spent an incredible amount of money for average food and no entertainment had to fight to even see the fireworks. I don't recommend this place for anything because clearly management is only trying to make money and not an experience to clients.
4
 tried the Boathouse set lunch. First up some oysters naturale, which taste quite fresh. Then the house salmon appetiser, which is a bit bland and lacking flavour. For the main I have the wagyu beef (Australian). This was disappointing, certainly not melt in the mouth, the fat content seems like a normal steak in fact. Finally for dessert the sorbet, which is quite good, especially the accompanying berries. Overall the food is a bit below my expectation for this standard of restaurant. It's pleasant for sure, but I'm not sure about the value, and think there might be better options in this price bracket
3
the food was well enough presented but was expensive and really not quite sure why. DÃ©cor is average and typical of the modern industrial bared restaurants sprouting up across the planet. Not much of a view from the restaurant and not too impressed with the management. Snooty and absorbed in something but not the satisfaction of guests. The wine prizes are too high and having chosen the paired wines we were disappointed with the quantity per glass. Wine was good and well paired but quantity was poor. There are many many restaurants in Singapore and I would recommend looking elsewhere
1
Staff completely uninterested. Close to being even rude. Seems fair to say we were the last one in and they wanted to close early. Poor service. Was asked to pay before I could get my drinks.... Never coming back.
3
Drinks from the outdoor terrace on the roof are great - but expensive. The view of The Marina Bay Sands and the surrounding area is just fantastic.
5
If you are looking for a restaurant to celebrate a special occasion or just dine in a fancy restaurant with your amore then this is the place. The location is very good, just behind the Merlion and the even better part is that there is a bar at the roof top so you can have a coctail after dinner while enjoying the Singapore skyline. We had the three meal course with wine pairing. The mushroom soup was exceptional for starter and then the ribeye was cooked to perfection. The desert was a chocolate mousse which ended the dinner perfectly. The wines were pre-selected by the management and they were really good. The staff are very friendly and go for the extra mile. I have to say that I was really happy when I arrived at the restaurant and the staff had a welcome note on my seat wishing me all the best (after coordinating with my gf for the special occasion). I believe that the staff will be very happy to help you make a great night if you decide to dine at this restaurant.Enjoy
5
We were there just right before the magic hour so watching the sun set and was just one of the best experience I ever had in this Singapore trip. The menu comes with wine pairing which fits my dish so well that I think they are very thoughtful about the whole thing.Everything is just so perfect that I cannot complaint at all....
4
The rooftop bar is a great place for a pre-dinner drink- lovely view of Marina Sands Hotel , the Esplanade centre and the Singapore flyer.The food was very tasty- we selected a 4 course menu., both choosing different items. Scallops was one course but consisted of just one scallop- delicious but disappointing there was just one. Portions on the whole were small but very enjoyable.Very friendly and attentive staff and some very good wines. I would go back
2
We visited this restaurant in the beginning of January for dinner. Booking in advance was smooth.The atmosphere was nice, but the rest was disappointing. We ordered 2 fish dishes, a sharing dish and a pizza. By far the best thing was the pizza... although a majority of the dishes on the menu was fish. The fish soup I ordered was the smallest main course dish I have ever seen and in a addition it was really boring. My wife had fish as well - also no very tasty. Garlic fries on the side had way too much garlic and the chicken wings were too spicy. No kids menu in the restaurant and they could not offer us half portions either from the regular menu.Toilet was not clean and we accidentally saw some linen they used behind the bar - it was stained and dirty...not very appealing. Prices are on level with other restaurants in the area.Service was OK - but we will certainly not go back, there are so many much better options
5
Last minute decide to celebrate birthday here with my bf, they have prepare a little surprise for us.Very good service, attentive staff.We order 3 course set meal, that is a little bit time to wait for the main course, but the manager offer us tea & coffee to apology keep us waiting...anyway we were taking and enjoy the wine while we waiting for the main course, so is not a big issue for us. Very good experience here, definitely will come back again..
5
We booked here last minute on our second night in Singapore, a bit jet lagged we didn't want to walk far from our hotel. I booked on the Internet, very efficient, and asked for a table with a view as we are on our honeymoon When we got there we were met at the door by a very friendly waiter who took us to our table that had a little honeymoon message on it, really nice touch.We went for the 3 course set menu with wine matching. Every course was delicious and the wine was good too, nice to try something different with each course. Our dessert was probably one of the nicest we have ever tried - chocolate mousse with a kind of iced marmalade. They also wrote happy honeymoon in chocolate on the plate, very sweet.The service was fabulous.A perfect setting and dinner. Thank yo
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday with the family at Boathouse tonight. A nicely set up restaurant with pleasant decor. The service was really excellent. Attentiveness and pleasantly efficient ... really quite impressive. Food was very well presented and everyone enjoyed their meals (ranging from steak, fish and lamb shank)Overall an excellent experience - thanks !PS I have marked this as a 'family' visit but my family are all adults. I would probably not recommend this as restaurant for young children. More romantic/couple
4
Nice menu, best described as French oriented cuisine. Fish and meat were well prepared and presented, above average. The wine list was comprehensive and with a good selection. Service was also good as was the atmosphere. Good place to goo when you want to have a now evening to share with someone you care or with good friends.
5
Great food and view...great service too!
Recommended!try this restaurant in sure you will gonna like it specially the steamboat!
5
Great food and wine matching menu. We opted for the wine matching 3 course menu which was a great option and definitely enhanced the flavours. Wonderful service through out dinner and a more enjoyable in a small intimate restaurant in the middle if the main area of Singapor
5
I choose this place for my proposal because of it's unique location and great reviews by others. And the place did not disappoint. 1) Great service:I emailed to reserve a table and the staff (Jeanette) was prompt in replying and attending to my request and queries.I made a trip down earlier to check out the place and met the manager (Caius) who brought me around and showed me around and made notes on what I needed on the actual dayOn the actual day, I went down early to set up the place and once again, great assistance not just from the managers but also the staff who were briefed and instructed to assist me.2) Great foodWe ordered a combo meal which consist of a soup, a mains & desert. I like in particular the rib eye. Tender, juicy and tasty. My girlfriend enjoyed the desert, chocolat. It was creamy and really chocolatey. What made it even more interesting was the crackling effect the desert have as it was sprinkled with sugar sized sweets that will crackle when it hits your tongue3) Great ambienceWe had the proposal up at the rooftop bar. Lovely scenery with the fullerton hotel on one side and the esplanade, flyer, MBS on the other. It was cooling with light music to accompany the night. If you have a special occasion and hope to make it a memorable one, this won't go wrong
5
I tried the set lunch & loved the way the trout is done. The orange dessert was very refreshing too. The place is not too crowded & quiet enough to have a good conversation
5
good food, good location, good views ==> good times !The staff was very helpful in getting us well taken care of
5
I organised the drinks and dinner on behalf of my boss for 20paxs and initial communication with the restaurant staff, Jeanette, through emails were very prompt. I did not sit in for the dinner myself but based on the feedback from the senior management team all had a very very good time at Prelude and enjoyed dinner at the main dining hall - Boathouse. Although, there was no vegetarian options on the menu, the chefs were more than happy to prepare something else which they told me were great! Many thanks again and will definitely be back again
4
The service was excellent! Food was nice. We like the wines very much. Will recommend it to friends and visit again definitely.   
4
Hosted a business dinner for 10pax and everyone loves the food and ambience! Food was served timley despite a big group.Will definitely be back again
5
Smallish restaurant located in a heritage building. Lunch is a set with a choice of 2 or 3 courses with coffee thrown in. Good value as food was excellent both the starter and main course- we did not have desserts. My companion and I took different items, so between us with tried 2 of the 3 selections and all was good. Service was fine and quite speedy, so doable for lunch during the work day
4
We hosted a business lunch here, although it was busy and there was a buzz going, it was still a pleasant environment for a group lunch. Our guests could still speak and hear each other without having to raise their voices. Food quality was good, the beef was done perfectly according to request. Will certainly come back when in town and recommend others
4
Restaurant stylish, quiet, ideal for romantic dinners, exquisite service, cutlery and crockery of very good quality, first dish take cream of mushrooms with foie gras, as a main dish meat and fish perfectly cooked grilled, for dessert we chose different sorbets, accompanied by sweet Moscato D'Asti
5
My partner (Malaysian) and I (Italian) traveled from Malaysia to Singapore to celebrate our 5th month anniversary. I always like to try to organize something special for her in all our dates so I decided to contact the restaurant and....With the help of the staff, once arrived we have been accompanied to our table where my partner found a very nice rose and a message (I requested) and an extra card from the restaurant welcoming us and wishing us an happy anniversary. In addition, we also get a surprise love message on our dessert plate.We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all team for delivering us an unforgettable experience. Professional staff, nice suggestion of wine pairing and very nice environment.My partner and I work in the hospitality industry as well, it has been a pleasure being surprised instead of surprise other.Well done to the Boathouse Team
3
The place is well located but we were inside the restaurant so did not enjoy any special view. The food was fine but I cannot tell it was special. The service was very good
4
Very pleasant atmosphere with music background and views of marina bayDelicious cuisineGood choice of fish but a bit limited for meatAffordable winesAttentive and convivial serviceBest to park at Six Battery Roa
5
Thank you boathouse for the lovely meal you have provided for my wife and myself.Love your lunch menu. Its very value-for-money and the steak was very very nicely prepared. Seldom do restaurant deliver medium-rare as good as this.Would like to compliment Kader and team for your outstanding service in menu recommendation and the special birthday surprise.Would certainly visit boathouse again
5
Made a booking for 50pax for a company event. We had the 5 course set meal that was customized with the option of fish or steak. Despite the short preparation time for the food and to cater to a sizeable crowd, all the food came out hot and taste great. Scallops and foie gras were the key highlights of the meal.The service team that night was fantastic handling our request promptly. The smile on their faces made the whole experience complete. Little steps were taken to ensure no stone unturned. The icing on the cake was heading to their rooftop bar with a view of the Marina Bay area, having drinks there with great company made the night special. Highly recommended, you must make a trip there

I made a reservation for 7 people on the 30th of May 2014 and arrived at the boathouse for a celebratory graduation dinner. I ordered their 3 course meal, consisting of the seafood soup, Steak and the chocolat desert. Their soup was tasty, their steak well marinated and their chocolat desert was amazing! They had the pop candy in it, you know the type you used to eat as a kid? My desert even came with a "happy graduation" in chocolate on the plate to congratulate me!I absolutely loved the service and the food there. I will definitely come back! personalized service :

The Prelude rooftop bar in Singapore has a prime view of the bay (and the Grand Prix if you happen to be here at that time.) However where to start in respect of the totally hapless service?. Trying to get food and drinks orders to a waiter (for just 6 people) seemed to take forever with one waiter speaking back the orders and one writing it. When the wine came the waiter spent quite some time trying to "uncork" a screw top bottle...only to be rescued by a supervisor who pointed out the screw top. Clearly no idea. Cocktails are weak as water. I suspect a single shot (if that) at best. Just tasted like fruit juice. Stick with wines and mixers and don't bother spending extra money on watery cocktails. Food is average. Pizzas are reasonable, much of the rest is a fried food bonanza..avoid it if you support vascular health and well being, If you want a view and sharp service and proper drinks..pop across the road to Lantern bar at Fullerton Bay instead

My husband I have been to the Boathouse restaurant on two separate occasions, one night midweek in March 2014 and last Saturday night. Each time we have thoroughly enjoyed having a bottle of champagne on the Prelude rooftop bar whilst taking in the gorgeous views of Marina bay, The Fullerton Hotel and the river. The Prelude is a small, intimate and unpretentious bar that is a perfect place to have a drink before your meal. The Boathouse Restaurant is in actual fact an old Boathouse that has been cleverly restored and converted into a small intimate restaurant. On Saturday night the six of us ordered the 4 course set menu with wine pairing( $69++ food and $45++ wine pairing plus supplements). The food and service were excellent. The only criticism I could make is that the Hokkaido scallop entrées were surprisingly small(only one delicious scallop). The three of us who ordered the scallops were expecting at least one scallop as the menu stated: “Hokkaido scallops pan roasted & braised leek in rich scallop emulsion”. All in all I would highly recommend the restaurant and rooftop bar

My husband and I spend most of our time going to nice restaurants when we are in Singapore. This one had lovely food and wonderful service. The only sad part was the view of the bay was blocked by an empty outdoor deck (which they only open for private parties). I would have loved to have eaten out there. Yes, even in the heat! We began our evening at the rooftop bar, Prelude, upstairs. It was a very nice evening
4
It was restaurant dining week, and a group of 8 of us decided to book this place for lunch and try their dining week set menu... overall the food is fine dining quality, plates were presented nicely and dishes served were presented professionally...portion was not too small, not too big... it was just nice.. i ordered the duck config and enjoyed it very much... overall.. great "cheaper" experience of fine dining ..

I went Boathouse　with my husband on May 3rd,2014.It was very old building but chic and calm.We ordered 3 courses with wine pairing.First,I had vagetable soup with Chardonnay.Next,I had sea bass fricassee with Pinot noir.They are very nice pairing!My husband ordered rib eye with Cabernet.It was amazing!We like wine but we can't drink so much.Thanks to Boathouse,we can enjoy several kind of wine by the glass.How amazing dining it was! We wannna visit Boathouse next trip to Singapore

The restaurant has a very cosy environment, not to mention the good food. The staff was also very courteous and helpful. I will definitely recommend the place to friends

Lunch for 4 on a Friday.Possibly it is because of the frequently poor service standards in Singapore restaurants but this place gets it right by not being over ambitious. Choice of 3 starters and 3 mains is all that you get for lunch but a good mix (when I was there the mains were salmon, steak and spatchcock). Appetizers came promptly (not universal for restaurants in the central business district) and the restaurant staff managed to send them all together (rare in my experience in Singapore). All 4 of us had the timbale of crab as a starter - very good if not particularly exciting. I tried the spatchcock which was just the right level of gaminess and beautifully cooked for the main. My companions seemed to be enjoying the salmon.Winelist good but not cheap.Overall good value for money and a place I would be very happy to go back to

Great food limited menuPrelude bar upstairs has agreat view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands particularly at nigh
5
Great Ambience. Had drinks at the rood top bar before dinner, which provided great views of the city. The food was well cooked and good sized portions. The waiting staff were very helpful and accommodating- allowed me to bring an extra person to dinner at such a short notice.Great variety and reasonably priced
5
Had our corporate event at Boathouse and I was very impressed with the service and food. It was my virgin try at organising a corporate event and the assistance I got from both Jeanette and Kader were remarkable. I had people telling me how great the event was thereafter. It will not be possible without their help. :)Will definitely recommend my friends and biz associates to hold their events at Boathouse

I work in Singapore's Central Business District but, despite having been here for a number of months, had yet to find the perfect place to meet clients and have working lunches. Having visited it yesterday, Boathouse seems to have solved this problem. I was greeted warmly by Kader, the incredibly attentive manager, upon arrival and shown to a lovely table with great views of Marina Bay. Beyond the view, the ambiance within the restaurant is lovely and it's full of character. Every time I tried to catch one of the waiting staff's eye, they responded and came over immediately and our order was taken promptly with a helpful tip on which dessert to order. The food, from starter to dessert, was delicious and the lunch set menu is excellent value for money.I have no idea where the last review came from as my experience was nothing but pleasant, and I found the staff to be very attentive and friendly. After yesterday, it's likely to become my go-to place for business meetings in the area

A part of one of Singapore's 'institutions' - the Fullerton Hotel - is also the Boathouse. It is a plesant restaurant located a few steps away from the hotel on the corner of Fullerton Road overlooking the Marina Bay. It provides a very nicely composed set menu, which I chose and which is excellent and nicely priced. Service was impeccable and so was the food as well as its presentation. Highly recommended and worth a revisit

Shaped like a magnificent three-storey, stately ship that is permanently docked, Boathouse Fullerton looks interesting from the outside and offers diners great views from the inside as well.Interior-wise, this place offers a quaint and intimate ambience in a beautiful setting of rich browns and elegant chandeliers. Besides the sophisticated decor that gives diners a sense of happiness, the service crew provided rather immaculate service as well. This place prides itself on bringing French dining to a new height.For lunch, they only have set meals. We chose the three-course sets. Appetizer was the Crabe - marinated blue crab, smoked tomato coulis and crispy herb tuile. The blue crab paste was very sumptuous, redolent of the sweetness of fresh crab. Eaten with the cheese-like crispy triangles of tuile, this appetiser leaves one longing for more.Our Main Course was the Roeuf - rib eye, fine mashed potato, heirloom carrots and bordelaise sauce. The beef was rather tender (we asked for medium rare) and slightly chewy, juicy. The mashed potato was so fine and tasty we thought it was some kind of cream initially.Finally, time for Desserts. We shared the L'Orange - orange and chocolate meringue rock, crumbles and orange granite. As meringue goes, the dessert crumbled into the mouth and dissolved easily, but it was a little too sweet, in my opinion. While the orange flavor was quite promiment, I thought that the white chocolate somewhat obliterated the orange's citrus flavor; I prefer orange desserts made with dark chocolate as the contrast is better.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to pop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/lunch-at-boathouse-restaurant.htm

Despite the discounted prices in restaurant week, Boathouse still lives up to its reputation by offering impeccable foods and attentiveness. We enjoyed the entire menu and even the wine pairing. The ingredients are sizable and fresh. Top-notch quality. Well done

My wife and I had a lovely dinner at the Boathouse yesterday. The ambience was cosy for a romantic date, the service was impeccable, and the main course that I had was just amazing- Pan Seared Atlantique sea bass , fricassee of seafood, cauliflower puree and essence of forest mushroom! Quite a mouthful description, but essentially DELICIOUS! A perfect way to end a birthed dina :

Kicked off my Restaurant week (RW) 2014 of 5 reservations with dinner on monday at Boathouse. I think they raised the bar so high all my other gourmet indulgences at the rest of the 4 outlets will be benchmarked against this one. The composition of ingredients and tastes created in each dish were well thought through, skillfully prepared! Coupled with their impeccable timely service that was non-intrusive on the dining experience, i'd say Boathouse RW is a must-try even if it's a tad more pricey than the rest without the star. Fine dining cuisine but not with the typical fine dining portions! (Approx $65/pax for 3 course inclusive of taxes with no drinks, check attached pic for set menu)Started my dinner with the foie gras, and my partner the fish stew so we could try both items. Was surprised at how generous the foie gras portion was! Seared to perfection it was a little crisp on the outside which gave it a stark contrast to what was inside, well complemented with the prune compote. It was a little dark, so if you can't make out what the dark looking items in the plate are, u might just send the entire piece of balsamic jelly onto your tongue while expecting the prune or foie gras. The fish stew, thankfully, not fishy nor too rich, was enjoyable. The scallops in this boillabaisse were fresh but could have been a little bigger to impress.The pan seared sea bass, ooh la la, was very fresh and yummy! It was skin on, perhaps coated with a little something so after searing it, the skin was slightly crisp but still retained that layer of chewy QQ texture. Flesh was very juicy. U see i'm trying very hard not to sound overly impressed, so i'm just gonna pick on a small piece of fish scale and a bone that was in the fish to take that 3 points off the scale of 100. The mushroom sauce that came with it was.., is.., should be the best i've come across thus far. Despite knowing how much calories it contains with that smooth creamy texture that is bursting with essence of forest mushrooms, I asked for 2 more servings of it. oops. I am not a fan of lamb for that distinctive taste and smell. My partner loves it for the same reason. I tried a small piece of their lamb shank and asked for more simply because it wasn’t the usual gamey lamb I’ve tried elsewhere. I love both desserts, very refreshing end to the meal. I could taste the vodka in the yuzu jelly that was layered on top of the lemon curd.Extremely satisfied. Burp

Its been a while since I have come to this place. Even as its in town, its slightly 'out of the way'. But the ambience is nice and its a unque location, experience.Food was better than average but nothing to scream about. Ordered the soup but it was a slight disappointment as I saw on the menu on the restaurant week site that it was a Provencal fish stew but it was changed to a potato soup with fish tatare and bacon bits. Good, but again, not great.For the main course I had the duck breast which was done to perfection. Somewhat subtle in taste but texture was great. My colleagues had the same comments on the Sea Bass.They served their signature desserts,again different from the ones on the one stated on the restaurant week menu. I had the mochi parfait and casis ice cream which in truth did not work out as well. Interesting nonetheless.What is really good about this place is the service. One of my colleague is heavily pregnant and they voluntarily brought a cushion for her to rest her back, and her dessert had words in chocolate written across the plate to congratulate her on her impending addition to her family. A very nice touch.Overall very good experience.Eva

Thank you for a great evening in a special place! A little spot full of locals and without tourists ( except us ;-)The food was excellent. Thank you for the wine recommendation!It was a highlight that you took us - and our desert - up to the bar on the rooftop where we could watch the lightshow in frontvof the Marina Bay Sands.Thank you for a great evening

We were on a girl's night out - Prelude and the Boathouse, were both delightful! The food was delicious, and the service was welcoming and prompt. We had a super time, and I am looking forward to go back with my husband :-

Great quality food and a good wine list. I ate here with business colleagues bit would love to go back with my wife.

Booked the Valentine's Day 3-course Dinner for wife and myself.Pictures showed on website is deceiving.Upon arrival, the table wasn't even ready. the chairs were unstable and the type of tables that the restaurant used were those metal frames with the wooden square top on it. Cutlery were not given and orders not asked to be taken. I had to alert the server, get my orders and asked for the required cutlery for every course, from the entree to the dessert. Even when I was given the cutlery, it was placed in the wrong position.The server seems unsure of what he was doing and couldn't understand the word "cutlery". We had to use back our butter knife to cut our mains.Food was served at 45 minutes for the entree, 30 mins for the mains and 20 mins for the dessert. Took us about 10 minutes to finish each course?Definitely won't be visiting this restaurant again. Total disappointment. Taste of food is nothing to shout about but not of poor quality either

This is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Singapore for the quality of the food served. We were five friends so I called to book a table and the lady confirmed we had our reservation. I also asked if we could be seated near a window, to enjoy the view of the Marina and because apparently despite the nice outdoor deck they only serve dinner inside. We also tried to book a table at the rooftop bar, but it took over 2hours to reply to us that it was reserved for a private event. When we arrived we were very surprised that they hadn't noted our reservation. Luckily there were quite a few empty tables, but that really didn't make a good impression especially since I had called them twice and even sent an email. We couldn't sit by the view either because those tables had already been reserved. Aside from this bad start the staff did all they could to make our evening very pleasant. They were very accomodating with lowering the freezing air con, explaining the menu, recomending wines and so on.The food was served very slowly. There was a big table of 15 people or so and were served before us. We might have been a tad slow ordering but still we got our starters over an hour after we were seated... we were starving !But the food was amazing. The portions were reasonable for a dinner. Could have been a little more. We had either bouillabaisse or cauliflower soup for starters and both were delicious. I didn't know cauliflower soup could actually be that good! It was delicate, well balanced flavours.Mains were sea bass with vegetables or the entrecote. These were just as delicious as the starters. I really loved the cooking of the sea bass and again the perfect seasoning of the vegetables and sauce. The presentation was also quite pretty.We all had the same dessert since we had the three course menu and there is no choice for dessert. But is was really good. Chocolate mousse with berries and berries ice cream. They gave us extra sorbet since it was so good !The wine recomended was nice and although expensive like any restaurant in Singapore, they had quite a wide range both in price and in choice.I didn't find the atmosphere amazing. The pictures from their website tends towards a more chic with white cloth look. Instead it's pretty and comfy, but nothing very elegant. No white cloth, table mats on the old side, light is a bit dim, music not great but at least not loud, and it would be good if there was a ceiling to make more of an atmosphere than the usualy tubes and ventilations.We would still go there again in a heartbeat since the food was amazing and the service nice and worth the price here

After a successful business trip my partner and I decided to spoil ourselves to a special meal.The Boathouse was an excellent choice in that the food was terrific, the service very good and the wine excellent.We were there for some time but never felt rushed
4
We are excited about the idea wrting what you want to say or celebrate some occasions on the dish . It s sorry because we dont have a chance to write on it . I think people feel happy when tehy see this message . Happy anniversary . How romantic it is. This s brilliant thought. Food is so delicious . The service is great . Highly recommende

Food was great and creative. Waiter and waitress was attentive.Deco was so-so, could have been better.The back area where the bar is was messy.Will surely go back for the food
5
We had a wonderful dinner here earlier in November while we were celebrating my birthday. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the food, service and the attention to detail was outstanding. In the 5 years we have lived in Singapore, we have dined at some lovely restaurants, which were completely let down by shoddy service. The staff at The Boathouse were very attentive, but not intrusive, and nothing was too much of a problem. The food was superb, and I finished off with a lovely light lemon pudding which just hit the mark. Will be going back again soon
4
The Boathouse was good but not great. Based on the reviews in Tripadvisor, we were expecting wonderful things. The first impression was surprising because the website gave the impression of a more elegant white table cloth environment , when in fact it is in a kind of funky heritage building. No white table clothes rather informal. Nothing wrong with that, in fact, I was pretty interested, just a surprise. Wen I asked the server about the history of the building, he didn't seem to know much except that it was a heritage building. No further info available. The menu is not extensive and we both ordered bouillabaisse which was very good. Salmon appetizer was also very good. However, nothing transcendent. Maybe it was an off night? Why does this place have such amazing reviews? There was nothing bad, and it was in fact quite good, but just not special
5
It was my first time having a meal at boathouse, and it was amazing.The ambiance was nice and peaceful and cozy feeling because of the warm service from the passionate staff. Service was perfect, the staff explained every dish to ensure you know what you'll be eating.The food was tasty and and I loved salmon parfait. We definitely return
5
Prior to our departing family living in Singapore for travel back to London our son organised a surprise night out selecting the Boathouse as the venue. Strange as on our first trip to the city as part of a cruise we noticed the Fullerton Boathouse and wished we had the time to try it.What a choice he made with great friendly service enabling us to chat and for my wife and I to savour the best Rib Eye Steaks we have had in a long time. Our son thoroughly enjoyed his Sea Bass cooked to perfection. The rest of the choices were equally as good.We then went up from the second floor restaurant to the open bar at rooftop and loved the music setting the scene for the best views of river, flyer, bridge, Fullerton Hotel and high rise offices. The light show was spectacular. No one wanted to leave but to this day I have fond memories and will be back. Thanks to the lovely staff

Decided to try this after reading all the mostly good reviews. Have gone to the st julien restaurant next door but first time at the boathouse. Parked at fullerton hotel and walked across the road, easy enoughRestaurant seats about 50-60 pax and is simply furnished. Pity about the small windows though, you don't get a good viewThey have 3 and 4 course set menus, with wine pairings, and a la carte. We went for 4 courses and a bottle of german reisling. 1st course was smoked salmon, and it was innocent enough, it was ok. 2nd course was a choice between seafood stew and scallop. There was a $6 supplement for the scallop but the font is too small and the restaurant too dark, i didn't see it, till i chatted with the server. The scallop was ok, wish it was more than 1 though. The main was a choice of seabass and another fish. The seabass was not as good as say the one from Ember, but it was serviceable. Dessert was a good chocolate mousseNothing to blow your mind, but for a reasonable $69 for 4 courses, i can imagine why this place is popula

When visiting restaurants, one thing I try to do when finishing off the night is to ask myself 'was this a memorable meal?' if the answer is no then I most probably wont be coming back. Don't get me wrong, the food at Boathouse is good. But for a dinner that approaches $300 for 2 people there are way too many choices in Singapore of equal or better evenings. There were some small things that annoyed me, the lack of parking/valet parking, butter in a little plastic container you normally see at buffet restaurants, empty beer kegs entering the restaurant doesn't create the right ambiance at the start of an evening.The highlight for my wife and I was definitely the rooftop bar, in my opinion one of the best views in Singapore and a perfect place for a private event that I will definitely use in the future. And for a birthday or special occasion, Boathouse would be a good venue......there were a couple happening during our visit and they were all well looked after. For us, it was a nice evening, just not memorable
5
We had requested to be surprised and indeed we were. From the little welcome cards printed specially for us, to the choice of meal, our dining experience was brought up a great notch. It's gonna be a challenge for some other places to exceed the experience we had at Boathouse
5
The restaurant is conveniently located next to Fullerton Hotel and boast an extremely beautiful view of Singapore's skyline against Marina Bay Sands. Food was intricately presented with immaculate quality. The ambience is perfect for couples and families to have a comfortable dinner with no loud music to distrupt conversations. The restaurant manager, CK, was at his usual best and his services and attention leaves such a great impression, you just have to come back again. Well done CK and team! :

With the excellent reviews I was expecting a great dinning experience. I was disappointed. Unlike the pictures on the restaurant's own website the tables did not have table cloths and linen napkins but table mats and disposable napkins. Our table had a view of the bar beside which where unpacked cartons and beer kegs yet to be placed behind the bar counter. The counter top was cluttered with various items including gently warming jugs of water. There was no choice of bread rolls, a soft roll or none. The butter was in an individual foil and plastic container, as found at a cheaper hotel's breakfast buffet.The food from the limited menu was good if uninspiring. The cauliflower soup brought out the various flavours well but the texture was somewhat spoiled by the stringy leek at the bottom of the soup. The skin of the seared sea bass could have have been crispier. The texture of the sea bass was somewhat dry with little trace of natural juices.The service is attentive. However I would suggest that for those guests such as us, who choose the wine pairing option with the set meal, we are given a reasonably detailed description (preferably written) of what we are being served or at least shown the wine bottle so we can glean the information we may want.
3
The food and the restaurant are quite good. But I have not so satisfied with the waiter service to us, he don't have patient to explain the menu, and we feel a little impolite to us, may be our English not good. I hope they can improve it
5
We are fairly new to Singapore and have steadily enjoyed the wonderful restaurants that this city has to offer, so against some stiff competition, we made our reservation. On reflection, we are very pleased to say that it scored a perfect 10 out of 10 for a fantastic evening. The menu is limited, giving the obviously very talented chefs the opportunity to show their skills to their best possible standards. Each course was prepared and presented beautifully and truly a masterpiece.The service and personal attention that we enjoyed was just outstanding as was the ambience and I would certainly recommend the Boathouse for a wonderful dining experience
5
Very nice restaurant for a special occasion, Good food, pleasant ambiance and courteous service, all at a reasonable price

My fiance and I had a fantastic experience here! I was here for a Restaurant Week dinner, and was a bit apprehensive since the menu wasn't released ahead of time. However, there were so many good reviews from the past, I figured the Boathouse should be a pretty safe bet for Restaurant Week/to celebrate my birthday.It certainly didn't disappoint! Delicious appetizers: I chose the scallop dish (which was somewhat normal, still pretty gd! Loved the roasted broccoli), my fiance decided to try the other olive-inspired dish, which I wasn't exactly keen on at first since I don't like olives, but was v glad my fiance decided on it! Cannelloni stuffed with caramelized black olive (very different taste from normal black olive!) on olive toastMains: Fiance had tender beef with yummy chorizo mashed potatoes, with some crisps on top [mmm, nice texture] and some asparagus.Mine was a very nicely baked salmon w crisp skin in tomato soup. Very interesting, I haven't had salmon in soup before! Nice and light.Dessert-wise, I thought the rainbow cake didn't sound all that interesting but the cream cheese sauce/walnut praline was a gd touch! Honey and caramel ice cream that it came with was yummy..Blackforest cake also was different - didn't care too much for the madeleine sponge at the bottom of the cake, and the cherries were definitely very soaked in brandy. But, the dark choc pave saved it all! Really smooth and addictive!Little touches like a printed birthday sign for me, and the patisserie chef writing 'happy bday' to me on the black forest cake, were greatly appreciated :) Also very impressed with the service! Servers explained each dish to us and we were asked how our meal was going at every course. Lovely place to have a nice meal :) Thanks for a great experience
5
Service was perfect, the staff explained every dish to ensure you know what you'll be eating. They'll bend over slightly so that you don't strain your neck by looking up, such consideration & well-mannered. Food are served hot & fresh, attentive staff will be around you to top up water/bread. It was Restaurant week & I had a weekend lunch, I would have expected less service as I'm paying half the price but I am surprised by the excellent meal they've put up.I'll go back again for special occasion, the food & service is hard to come by in S'pore
4
it is a cosy area with nice ambience. food is great and the service is wonderful. the staff will constantly check on your needs and feedback. bought the restaurant week promotion to try the food - from the starter to the desserts, they were all perfect. a nice place for great company and good food
5
My friend and I enjoyed the dining experience + birthday celebration at Boathouse on Saturday. The restaurant manager and the staff there were excellent! The service was good, exceeding expectations and the staff were all very cheerful and friendly.. a very service-oriented group. Food quality was excellent as well. If the portions had been slightly bigger, it would have been perfect :
4
This restaurant is a great place to bring a date. Came here during restaurant week and once seated and conversation started it feels as though you are in your own world without accidentally eavesdropping other people's conversation. I had the pan seared scallops which was really excellent. The sous vous beef was ok but perhaps it was the expectations of the beef to be like grilled beef. For the desserts, my rainbow cake was disappointing though, go for the other option!P.s.: Ask for window seats to catch a glimpse of the light show by MBS =
5
First time there during the Restaurant Week and really enjoyed the service, atmosphere and food. Will definitely revisit Boathouse again
5
My first time during Restaurant Week and not my last. Food was delicious and dessert was simply remarkable even for a non-dessert lover like me. The manager and waiters were extremely attentive and knowledge about the food they served. The team left a very good impression and we will be back again
5
Have been here twice now and both times, everything was perfect. This includes service and the food. The wine selection is great, and the wait staff are very couteous. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Singap
4
The service was wonderful, food was great. Nice Ambience. Would recommend for other. I booked a table for two during the Singapore Restaurant Week. So The price I paid for was really value for money. 3 course dinner plus wine for two pax cost me only SGD150. Will definitely visit again. This was considered a great "night out" for both of us after arrival of my baby 6 months ago
5
It was amazing! The food and service were impeccable, staff were very attentive and we almost never had to wait even though the restaurant was packed. I have no ruse on the meal that I had in the restaurant, but I must say the rainbow cake was rather unforgettable. It was rightly textured that is dense yet slightly moist with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting to top it off. It looks great and tastes even better. Overall, if you are looking for a restaurant with excellent ambience and food that also have a wide selection of decent wine, this is definitely the place for you. You will have a great experience no matter if you're there as a couple, family or with friends
4
The restaurant was cosy and intimate. We were given a "window" seat and had a view of the esplanade.The salmon parfait was excellent. The duck confit was a bit salty, but overall satisfying with the crispy skin.Surprisingly, the rainbow cake was much better that those I have tasted in a long time.Service was impeccable and they even bother to explain the dishes before you eat.Will be back to try their set lunch menu
4
Very good service. We had the three courses lunch menu for restaurant week together with wine pairing. A very cosy place with small comfortable crowd. Staffs were very attentive, explaining to us how each of our dishes are prepared and also how the wines go with each course. Even volunteering to help us take a few photos upon seeing us trying to snap ourselves with the food. Food was good, love the duck leg and the rainbow cake. Definitely worth a visit
4
The salmon parfait was excellent. The plating was clean and neat as well. I would have preferred my duck confit with a crispier skin but it was overall moist and good. The pear puree was refreshing. The rainbow cake was surprisingly my favourite among the three. It was moist, with even distribution of the cream cheese frosting with even layers of the different colored cakes. The walnut praline was a little overpowering however. Overall an excellent meal
4
Food was slightly above average. Hokkaido scallop did not taste that fresh. The onglet was flavoursome and well cooked. Great atmosphere and service! I would like to commend on the person by the name of Mary whom served us. She was very attentive and did a great job in explaining the dishes to us. However, we were charged for coffee and tea which we thought was complementary
5
Decide to try out boathouse due to restaurant week! Didn't go with exceptional high expectations as we didn't know what to set as a benchmark but they exceeded all expectations. From the quality of food which was superb to the service and friendliness of their staff. Among the friends, we tried their scallop, to beef, salmon and black forest cake. Of course my description of what I ate was just the ingredients. I have done injustice to the efforts which the chefs have put up to create such wonderful tastes , and to the staff who so warmly explained the dishes to us (and just because I couldn't rem after the meal). Probably something small but I felt was really displaying the staff's effort to make e connection with the customers was that they even squat down whilst talking to customers so it is at eye level instead of customers having to look up. To me, that was a simple yet connecting gesture. Had a good time with my friends and would recommend anyone to just give it a try!
5
The service crew were outstanding throughout the night. Professional with a personal touch. It was my husband and I first time at Boathouse restaurant. The service crew gave a good recommendation of their menu and wine for pairing by asking for our taste preference. The restaurant paced the serving of the dishes well and took utmost attention to fine details. When my husband stepped away to use the washroom, one service crew came over, folded and placed the napkin nicely on the table. When we finished our main course, they checked if we will like to wait 5-10mins to serve the desert. Furthermore, they asked if we are here for a special occasion. As we replied it was our anniversary, the plate served with the dessert came with the chocolate wording of "happy anniversary". Paying attention to such details enhances the experience when Boathouse already has a great atmosphere and good food. Kudos of the team
5
this is a very good place to go for a meal because the service and staff were very attentive and knowledgable. Not only about the food, such as its origins, but also about the history on the boathouse etc. The Manager was also very kind to prepare a small gesture for my Mom's birthday.Overall, the food quality was excellent and great. the ambience is nice and it is very affordable for a lunch. great to go for a nice and enjoyable meal! :-

Had dinner with my husband for my birthday. They were sweet to prepare birthday note. The ambience was nice and peaceful and yet cosy feeling because of the warm service from the passionate staff. It is a place that makes you feel that fine dining can feel warm instead of serious straight faces. I took the four course dinner with wine pairing, we enjoyed the food thoroughly and my husband was not even a fish person to begin with but he enjoyed the sea bass. The food was simple yet accentuated with the right amount of seasoning and sauces. Bu the 3rd course, we went up to the rooftop bar to get a little air, nice place to have an after dinner drink. Overall, it was a beautiful evening for us, and would we visit again? Yes, definitely

Just celebrated my wedding anniversary at Boathouse. Located centrally with a beautiful sunset view over the Singapore skyline. Excellent service - Wife is pregnant and they offer a small pillow as a cushioning for her. So thoughtful. Simple gesture like offering a longer "break time" between the main course and dessert are simply perfect. CK even suggested us to enjoy the view of the Singapore skyline at their rooftop bar etc after dinner.I would rate the staff as one of the best I ever met. Fish is very fresh and is cook perfectly and you could actually feel that the chef also pay a lot of pride on their food. Perfect dining place for couple to celebrate occasion

I had a dinner for 2 at boathouse for a birthday celebration. The staff was very helpful with my initial preparations and we were given a table by the window without us requesting. There was even a birthday note on our table as well which was a pleasant surprise. Throughout dinner, the staff was very attentive to our needs and requests which is greatly appreciated. We had a surprise dessert from boathouse which was very thoughtful with a birthday message, taste wise, very refreshing!. Kudos to the service staff for such helpfulness and initiative, special mention to CK and Sabrina. Thank you boathouse for giving us such a enjoyable birthday dinner, we had a great time. Thumbs up!

It's my 3rd time having a meal at boathouse. This time to celebrate our 10th year wedding anniversary. We were given a table by the window without requesting for it and a nice little note to congratulate us on the milestone. We ordered the set meal with wine pairing, food was great and tweaked to suit our preferences. Service was excellent, CK and crew never fail to impress with their attention to details (replacing my husband's napkin with a fresh one when it fell on the floor, suggesting a 10 mins break before dessert, constantly making sure we are well taken care of... Etc) and making our dining experience as beautiful as possible. Kudos to everyone! Will definitely be back with family, friends and biz associates

Perfect venue for admiring the National Day Parade and fireworks. Staff was super-attentive and the athmosphere was friendly. The dinner itself was slightly uneven, but all of the niceness in the overall experience more than made up for this. I would definitely go again. Oh, and kids are welcome here too

Great place with good ambience and nice food. My friends and I took the 3 courses dinner special. Food was pretty good except it's kinda salty. Will definitely be back again

What I had initially thought would be a simple & enjoyable dinner with my dearest gfs turned out to be more than that as they have put together a surprise Hen's Night for me!A magnificent scenic view of Singapore's landscape greeted us when we got to the al-fresco dining area. As the date of our visit coincides with the NDP rehearsal, we are exceptionally thrilled to be given a corner seat with an unobstructed view of the fireworks.My girls & I each went with the 4-course dinner set which clearly didn't disappoint. The beautiful presentation of the food just makes one can't wait to dig into the flavours that await us. And indeed, the food is such a delectable delight that it simply overthrow the typical stereotype that set meals can never make an impression.- Home-Cured Salmon (as pictured): The thickness of the salmon is just right. And the acidity of the pickled cucumber paired with the salmon just further enhance this simple dish's great taste.- Pan-Roasted Hokkaido Scallop (as pictured): I personally felt the braised leek slightly overpowered the scallop when eaten tgt. But nonetheless, the lingering natural sweetness of the scallop make us yearn for more. We can easily polish off 5 of such in 1 serving!- Pan-Seared Atlantic Sea Bass: I'm in full awe of this dish! Love the crispy sea bass skin so much that I finished it all. The fish is perfectly cooked & the meat falls off nicely under the knife. Its also the first time I realized how well mushroom essence can complement the fish. - Chocolate Mousse: Our dessert (which was served as the fireworks started) comes with a surprise- It was topped with crackling popping bits! While watching the fireworks before our eyes, we have "crackling popping fireworks" going off in our mouth too! What an interesting way to end the meal with.. Furthermore, the sourness of the seasonal berries worked out a great balance with the chocolate, thus not over-cloying.The service provided by CK (the Restaurant Mgr) & his team is fully packed with friendliness, thoughtfulness & attentiveness! I am truly appreciative toward the entire team especially CK for accommodating to my girls' requests & assist in bringing out the best of the night for us. This is definitely more than just a wonderful dining experience

We are 4 guys who could afford to have a long lunch and do it quite regularly.We took the 3 courses lunch special ($39) with wine pairing ($32), which was half a glass of each wine.The food was pretty good, overall and the wine pairings were spot on, particularly the Austrian dessert wine.The experience was a good one, although some of the wine info was a bit lacking.I will be back again for another run

Many thanks for an excellent evening. Our guests are still talking about it & the wonderful Prelude views and Boathouse food.

My friends and I went to Boathouse to celebrate our dearest friend's Hens Night. As we would like to make a few surprises for the bride-to-be, we checked to make a few special requests and were delighted that the staff were able to assist us with it. It was my first visit to the restaurant. Upon arrival, we were greeted by CK and his team and ushered to our table. Was happy that we were arranged to be seated with a nice view, especially there was fireworks on that day due to the National Day Rehearsal. The personalized Menu sheet made the whole dinner more special and meaningful too. We had chosen the 4 course meal for our dinner. The food were delicious, and the food presentation made them even more appetizing. In addition, CK explained each course to us patiently and the staff were attentive throughout the whole dinner too. The fireworks went off just in time while our dessert was served. In all, it was a perfect dining experience and Hens Night went on smoothly and with a great success!Would also like to thank CK and his team for making the celebration a success with excellent service! Appreciate their thoughtfulness which made us feel special and welcoming

I had a nice and quiet dinner to celebrate my proposal to my fiancee back in May. The interiors were beautifully decorated and the service was excellent. The staff were always on-hand to provide more magic to an otherwise spectacular evening. The food was tasty too and we left with our custom-made Menu sheets to reminisce a truly memorable evening. Special thanks to CK for making our evening glamourous

I wanted a nice quiet place for a dinner to celebrate my anniversary with my fiance, so I thought of this place. Heard of this place but never had the chance to try it. I'm glad I made the choice to make reservation for dinner.Firstly, we were greeted by Kader at the door. He was very warm and welcoming, making sure we were comfortable at our table, which of course had the best view for fireworks that night! All thanks to the arrangement of Chun Kiat, the manager. The menu was explained to us and we were given time to ponder and decide. My fiance and I finally decided to go with the 3 course meal. She had the cauliflower soup with pan seared sea bass while I had the fish stew and rib eye.We were served some bread to start with, and I must say the staff were very attentive, never failing to top up our glasses of water. It's the little things that count I must say.The cauliflower soup was good, nice mix and not strong. The fish stew can be a little overpowering for some, but to me it was good. It went really well with the piece of salmon that came with it. Mains were tastefully prepared I must say. Presented simply but yet elegant. Rib eye was cooked to medium perfection!What better way to end a nice quiet cozy dinner than to stand at the gallery outside to watch the fireworks from the nearby NDP preview go off. Perfect!!I would definitely be back to the nice cozy place to have a quiet dinner with my fiance.Thanks for taking care of us

The Chefs of Boathouse never fail to surprise me! :D Been there a few time, food texture is good even the presentation of the food is beautiful. Makes all the worth going there. I have recommended this restaurant to a few of my friends and they were all very impressed by the food and of course the ambience. Service staffs are friendly and on the ball. Good job!

I went to the Boathouse for a birthday lunch with a group of 14 friends. We all went for the set lunch (choice of 4 starters, 4 mains and 4 desserts)The food was excellent, and the size of the portions was nice: I had the three course option and felt very satisfied without over eating.The food tasted very French (no embellishing the dishes with expensive ingredients like they do so often at this side of the world when trying to cook European cuisine), and was very balanced.The atmosphere was nice and the service very good.Some of our friends were a bit surprised by the bill afterwards: although it is a set lunch, certain dishes cost more and the supplemental prices will be added to your bill. The final bill was therefore a bit higher than expected, but it was well worth it

We were a party of 6 from a diverse background (Just 2 Singaporeans and 4 foreigners) but found Boathouse amazing for its attentiveness to service as well as its well thought out menu. What sealed the deal for us was the warm atmosphere that was unpretentious and perfect for a casual business dinner after a long hard day. Would definitely bring guests back again

If dinner at this restaurant was the only experience I will ever have of Singapore then I've found heaven on earth. The menu is very small, about 6-8 appetizers and 3-4 fish and 3-4 meat dishes which made the decision even harder to make because it all really seemed delicious. I had the bouillabaisse which was beautiful and the salmon for the main, and I finished it off with perhaps the greatest chocolate dessert I've ever had. A 66% dark chocolate with white chocolate in a terrine style. Out of this world! Cannot recommend it enough for any occasion from romantic older family or just an evening with friends. I recommend to first grab a drink on the roof which overlooks the Marina Bay and provides a splendid view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and a great viewing point for the light show as well. Cocktail selection is also good. I really cannot recommend this enough

The food is simply delectable and the music playing at the rooftop bar is pretty decent. However, credit has to be given to their team of attentive and affable service staff (CK- restaurant and Steve-bar) that made our time there a truly pleasant experience. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will certainly return.Jamie Ne

My second visit to Boathouse affirmed the consistency of their quality service and food. The restaurant's hospitality, attentiveness and sincerity were personified through the Maitre'D, CK and his team. Their professionalism and care of details had made our evening there for a birthday celebration so much more enjoyable and special.From the brilliantly prepared food - we had the four course with wine pairing - to CK going the extra mile to cater to our requests, Boathouse has delivered for us an exquisite dining experience.Keith ErSingapor
