Airconditioned cool with a warm welcome. Lovely coffees and teas and excellent food. Very near Chinatown’s Buddhist Thian Hock Keng Temple on Telok Ayer. Clean toilets. Nice find.

The environment of the cafe is simply superb. A complete break from sunny day walk in Chinatown and surrounding areas. Staffs very professionally and helpful in case you need to explore the areas more.

We had the vanilla dirt cake (too moussey, but cute, since it's served like a flower in a flower pot) and the chocolate lava cake (average). Nothing memorable, extremely average.
4
We had snacks - pulled pork sandwich (excellent), molten chocolate cake and ice cream (pretty good). It's a lovely,
Modern style cafe, with a nice ambience.

Was looking for a place to chill after lunch at Amoy Street. Stumbled upon the cafe by chance and we decided to step in for some coffe and cakes.Coffees were well made and the Molten Lava cake and the Triple chocolate cake were nothing short of amazing.The place wasn't too crowded at the time we arrived.

I visited this restaurant with two other friends for a Saturday lunch. It was rather empty at 12:30pm, with perhaps two other tables occupied. Overall a clean and cozy establishment with nice and efficient wait staff. I ordered the Japanese beef curry and the food was decent, though I find the curry served at Liang Court basement much better than this dish and costs slightly less.My friend ordered the ribeye steak and was able to swop the default wasabi sauce for goma. The vanilla mini dirt cake was so-so... there was a stiff portion near the end that was hard to break with a spoon. O_

The main course is yummy. I had grilled fish. Friend had onsen egg green curry don. The price is reasonable. Ambience is good. Dessert is fabulous - the molten lava cake and the dirt cake delicious. This place is generally crowded at lunch. So do be prepared to wait

Went there for dinner with some colleagues after work. Stumbled upon this place as it was nearby. The mains overall was rather average. The fries turned out to be the winner out if the whole meal. Their dirt dessert was unique as it had gummy worms in a flower pot of chocolate "dirt". It was more the unique presentation then the actual dessert itself. I found out later that having dessert in the flowerpot is the latest cafe trend after rainbow cake. The only positive thing about the place is that it opens late and allowed us to stay on for a long time on a weekday.

We came here after lunch for a coffee. Most of the lunch crowd had already finished by 1.30pm so there were no issues getting a seat. My cappuccino seemed to have a little too much froth and not so much coffee, but other than that was fine. Good atmosphere

Found this quaint little cafe along the street and decided to drop in. The truffle wagyu beef rice bowl was super duper yummy and so was the mini pancakes with vanilla ice cream! It was so cute! I ordered the Nutella drink and it was really good too! Can't wait to try out the other dishes next time

Popped in here to avoid a rain storm and had coffee and fries. Staff were really welcoming, the coffee was great and the fries were really good. The place is clean with a lovely chilled out atmosphere.

A friend who knew one of the owners took my husband and I there. Expecting the usual Western fare, we were pleasantly surprised with the fusion food offered. The pasta with prawns, lemongrass and basil was good, as was the tom yam risotto with seafood. Their famous Vanilla Dirt Cake lived up to its rave reviews, with layers of crushed oreo and some sort of cream cheese pudding that perfectly complemented each other. My husband wolfed most of it up! But the piece de resistance for me absolutely had to be the hot mini pancakes served with vanilla ice cream and topped with salted caramel-peanut butter crumble! Sheer heaven. The owner was trying out the recipe and we were the lucky first tasters of this amazing dessert! Let's hope they add it to the menu real soon. Divine!

Tucked away in a quaint shophouse along CBD area, Vanilla Bar & Cafe caught my attention because of its beautiful interior decor and famous Vanilla Dirt Cake. Its exact location is at 3 Boon Tat Street #01-01, Singapore 069612 and the number to dial is 6423 0366.As the name goes, the shop is furnished in a pretty, uncluttered style full of whiteness and resplendent of Zen-style serenity. The most distinctive point was the sweet vanilla scent that fills the cafe the moment one steps in - this scent immediately brings to mind delicious thoughts and the jazz music transforms one into another time. Catering to professionals as well as cafe hoppers, Vanilla Bar & Cafe serves as a spot for brunch and coffee in the daytime, and a dinner + drinks respite in the evenings.The Beau and I ordered an assortment of items from the usual menu and the special menu. The first item, for sharing, was the Boston Lobster Bisque topped with ebikko (SGD$10.90). While not exceedingly thick or creamy, this soup was strongly infused with the sapid sweetness of lobster, and there was a tinge of spiciness so we did not need to add pepper on our own. There were chunks of lobster swimming around in the soup - fresh, tender pieces of lobster so what more could we ask for?The Green Curry Pasta with Chicken and Mushroom (SGD$17.90) was from the special menu. It looked plain but trust me, the first bite made it impossible to stop till the plate was empty. The gravy was green curry literally - very tasty with hints of spiciness, and the pasta was so smooth one could slurp it in literally. The mushroom slices were juicy and added a distinctive flavor, as well as the tender chicken slices which added texture to the pasta dish. Time for desserts! We finally got to try the Vanilla Dirt Cake (SGD$9.50) - a beautiful dessert served in a tiny flower pot which I couldnt believe was edible at first. It was smaller than I had anticipated since this item always appear rather huge in photos on blogs or social media platforms. The pot and flower were not edible, so we dug into the "soil" portion of this dessert - an entire layer of Oreo crumbs that went very well with the thick, rich vanilla ice-cream that formed the base. The vanilla ice-cream was amazing as it did not melt easily, so even as we slowly savoured the dessert, the sweet, aromatic ice-cream was still rather solid.

I went Vanilla Bar & Café mainly for their desserts and of course their signature dessert, Vanilla Dirt Cake - $9.50. Frozen vanilla ice cream with oreo cumbs on top with two gummy worms. A tad disappointment in their desserts as I expected better taste for the price I pay. Plus points for the café is the lovely and warm interior and friendly staff.They served all day breakfast as well, worth a try.Check out my the full review on my blog: http://nkikichua.blogspot.com

Have been wanting to check out Vanilla Bar & Cafe for their highly raved Vanilla Dirt Cake which is served in a unique way, in a Flower Pot. They have main courses as well but our visit was to mainly check out their desserts. Prices may be slightly steeper here if you're comparing to other dessert cafes such as Wimbly Lu.We ordered the highly raved Vanilla Dirt Cake ($9.50) & Molten Chocolate Cake ($11.50). The Vanilla Dirt Cake is such an innovative dessert & it's serve to you in a Flower Pot with 'dirt' on top which is actually Oreo Crumbs w layer of frozen Vanilla ice cream & 2 jelly worms. Unfortunately, the Molten Chocolate Cake was a major disappointment. It was completely baked inside thus there wasn't any flowing chocolate effect. Overall, really nice place to chill and have a drink or bites! You can read more w photos here on my bloghttp://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/10/vanilla-bar-cafe-singapore.htm

The restaurant is small but has an intimate setting. It's a great place for business lunch or a get together with friends. The selection of food is considered decent but almost every dish taste great! I love the molten chocolate cake and vanilla dirt cake especially for the desserts

I visited this place twice to try their food and also their milk shake. Lets talk about the shake. I tried their Nutela shake and it was simply amazing...If it had more chocolate in it then it will be heaven. I enjoyed the shake that i came to try others as well. Trying the Vanilla and also Mocha shake, they are equally great

Nice place to have lunch with my workmates. I made a reservation and the staff was friendly to allocate a nice corner for us. Order pasta, tasty and nice portion for lunch. Nice selection of cake to end off for lunch and the selection for food menu is interesting. For the price that they charge, can't complain about the quality. Will definitely dine at this place again

This is a gem of a cafe. It's tucked into a corner of boon tat street (adjacent to amoy street if I'm not wrong). It's within a walkable distance from raffles place mrt station and ang siang hill. It's a fusion western-and-japanese place that serves fare from don(s), udon, pasta and fish and chips. Slow cooked pulled pork sandwich, pork belly don and their vanilla dirt cake pudding are among their popular dishes. Lovely jazz music in the background. It's usually VERY busy during the office lunch hour between 12-2 but before and after that timing, it's pretty quiet and cosy. Great for quiet catch-ups with friends. They take reservations, so make sure you make use of this service especially if you intend to go down during the lunch hour on weekends. Pricing is average cafe price, about 10-15 Sg dollars for most main courses. They also serve a good range of alcoholic drinks which is great to chill-out with during the night time. Happy hour is between 4-8pm. Will definitely be back! Atmosphere is great and food is not bad too. There's also an outdoor smoking area for those who smoke although it does get quite warm/hot in the afternoons. This place is also available for booking for events
