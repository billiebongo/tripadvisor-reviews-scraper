Enjoy simple food with full of sea breeze. A big crowded at weekend evening as it's a small restaurant

Stopped by this restaurant after a long beach front walk. The lunchtime menu was very good value at around 11S$ for a 3 course meal. The food was very good and the service was excellent and fast. Would recommend this place for afternoon lunch.

The bistro has a nice view of the sea and offers reasonably good food and drinks. It has set meals too for weekday lunch.

Most of the seats are outdoors, it is really cosy with a nice view out at the beach and sea. The staff were really friendly and the food was really good. I loved their mashed potatoes and cream spinach.

We went for a walk and had our supper there, windy and facing the sea. Nice place for a beer and some snacks. They have food for vegetarians which was awesome. We enjoyed time there with fast service and environment.

A quiet place, because it is far away from city, romantic setting. Nice steaks, beers etc. Very reasonable priced. Come here to get chill out!
Oversee the beach. Can come here by bike or car.
Service was fast n prompt.
Lovely place.

The sea side Bistro is a right place to unwind on a weekend soaking in the sea side Breeze. Primarily a watering place it offers the Italian mains of Pizzas and Pastas. We tried the thin crust pizza and it was awesome. The fries were of good quality - Long and well fried unlike the broken pieces you get in McD.. No qualms on the service and nothing can get quicker than it. Pizza came in 10 mins

The food & service here is top-notch. Especially try their satay, pasta & roast chicken. All dishes are made with the freshest ingredients. The bistro has a great view of the unobstructed sea. Great for also just chilling and having a pint of beer. You can even consider having your ROM here with a sea-view

I love this place very much. It is located by the beach and sitting here sipping a glass of wine is fantastic. Watching the crowds and the beach goers really make my day. I recommend to come down to chilli out if nearby. The atmosphere is fantastic

Plane spotting and swimming in the sea are some reasons to visit Changi beach park. You could eat in the hawker center or walk a few minutes and come to Bistro Changi. Nice food, great overlooking the sea and close to the starting or landing planes. Well I usually prefer landing planes because then the wind does not blow into your face

Good location overlooking the water (especially at sunset), great happy hour cocktail prices on Wednesday, however Red Wine was served chilled. Food was surprisingly delicious, deserts menu basic but scrumptious.

Wonderful Bistro with great and reasonable price food. Lovely place to hang out to friends for beers and food. Not forgetting Fantastic staff and great chef :)
Ate here many times, and will always come back

A friendly little bistro. Great for plane watching at changi. Very fast service and friendly staff. Better than average food, with a good selection. Good but not amazing. Lots of space for children to run around, great for families.

It's really the location that is best about this place. On the beach, and as the sun falls, they wind back the awning.
That said the service is always friendly, and the food is OK.

Cycled up from East Coast park.....totally drained and looking forward to drink and bite to eat for the journey back.The sausage and mash was good but the chicken tortilla wrap was under cooked and looked awful. Ok the staff re-cooked but by then my wife had gone off the idea and to be honest it was not so much better second time around.We know you can do better because we have eaten here before

Went there with my girlfriend to celebrate my advanced birthday celebration. We ordered mushroom soup, nacho, grilled salmon and fried mushroom balls for late dinner. Staff are friendly. I told the staff that I was very hungry. Please serve the mushroom soup first. Apparently they were quite fast upon customer service or off peak hour. Mushroom soup was nice with homemade garlic bread as compliments. Love this place and will be back again

Had lunch there one weekday. It was a very sunny afternoon, however it was not hot. Instead, it was very windy and cool.We ordered from their set menus, which include a soup with a slice of garlic bread, main course, a drink and a scope of ice cream. The sirloin steak that I ordered was good.Nice place for a quick (prompt service), value for money lunch with a super view

Had lunch here - had a been expecting the Monday-Friday set menus but because it was Diwali Public Holiday, they had reverted to the a la carte. The mushroom soup was very tasty, the vegetarian spaghetti ditto, and the vegetarian pizza was OK, nothing special. Let down by the cappuccinos, which are pricey but still come from a push-button machine with ersatz milk
4
Have eaten here a few times and the food and service is always good. It is an outside restaurant next to the beach and with great views of ships and planes passing by. Menu is good and reasonably priced with plenty of choice. Food is freshly prepared and you can get drinks (wine, beer) too. Easy parking close b

We decided to have a walk at the changi beach park for we know that the area is having improvements.Going back we saw this place and they have a live band that night. We had drinks, relax while watching the planes coming towards changi airport
