Food is good as usual. Similar to the original coffee shop in terms of its taste, without the long wait and queue.
Definitely coming back whenever I have the craving!

I don't understand the hype about this white restaurant.
There's nothing fantastic about the food. I work nearby so we come here regularly for business lunch. It is expensive and taste ordinary.
Sometimes you even have to queue!

Bee hoon is a must in this restaurant they have various portions and other selections of items, i enjoyed the bee hoon and the hot plate venison. Beers could be colder and service could be better.

Went there with my family and overseas guest! They loved the ‘White Beehoon’ and I ordered 2 large ones and 1 large Fried rice,Potato leaves, Omelette and the handmade beancurd came very late after we almost finished everything! Service was prompt but no ice water provide

The branch that opened after their main restaurant at SSC, Provides more offerings in terms of dishes etc Taste wise, their signature white noodles are not as good as the original branch but still good enough to leave you satisfied. The menu has more offerings like Man tou, veges and side dishes.

It's my first time to the sun plaza outlet but second visit to White Restaurant. The seafood white bee hoon that they served is consistently good and the gravy enhanced the taste of the otherwise bland bee hoon.Though there was a queue and we didn't want to share tables, we did not need to wait for very long. Apart from seafood white bee hoon, their chicken wings, fried rice and sambal kang kong was also good. Was pleasantly surprised that the bill came up to ~$50 for 5 dishes and drinks coz dining in Singapore can be quite expensive

We came to Sun Plaza on purpose to try out white beehoon, the legendary white beehoon. We were disappointed.The white beehoon did not have a lot of sauce, it was dry and it was not even hot enough.They charge service fee 10% but not even a single napkin in sight. They also do not even provide serving spoon when we asked for it, they told us to wait.It is ok as we didn't push for it. We quickly finish our dishes, paid for it and off we go

Went to lunch with my wife yesterday. Asked for cold barley drink and it came out hot. The waitress took it back and put a few lumps of ice in it and it came back warm. Very complacent.Ordered three chef recommendations, white beehoon, salt egg sotong and tobacco leaf. The prawns in the beehoon was tasteless. The deep fried sotong came out oily and soggy. The vegetable dish was nothing to look at and taste flat

Had our family weekend dinner and birthday celebration there. The queue was long before 6pm. We had to wait for all family members to arrive before we can go in. The white beehoon was good, family kids like it. The stir fry jacket fish was fishy and cost $32, not good at all. The rest of the dishes are very much similar stuff from common zichar stall. I was expecting better quality from a restaurant in a shopping mall. 1 star off.I asked a older captain for a lighter to lit the birthday candles. He said he will look one for me, but he never did. Later I had to asked a waitress who found one for me. Another waitress was kind to clear the cutlery and wipe clean the table before we had our birthday cake. Had a rude surprise when I had to go to cashier counter to pay the bill when the restaurant collect 10% service charge. This took another star off. Not a place I will patron regularly unless the service improves or the service charge is removed

We ordered the seafood white beehoon and the deep fried chicken wings (mid joint). The food was delicious and inexpensive and service was fast and efficient. There is also a White Restaurant in Lor 4 Toa Payoh. It was opened in the middle of last year and really convenient to visit as it is within walking distance of Toa Payoh MRT Station

Expect a queue. I used to eat at opposite Sembawang Shooping Centre, same queue as long but at Sun Plaza at least you eat in comfort of air-con : )

I have been there many times. But service attitude is not that warm. First 2 times the quality of food is good, but recently seems the food standard was dropped. The white mee hoon is very dried and less soup.

The food was OK I guess, the white beehoon was kind of nice, but it might be a bit too wet for some of you. Some of the food weren't as good as the main branch. Staffs were mostly friendly.

Famous in Sembawang. Old day food new concept restaurant. Must try Signature white beehoon, fried meat & seafood roll, fried mid wing....

Food was fantastic, do come by and try their White beehoon and their other dishes! Do try to order the larger portion for families 2-3 and medium for 2 hungry people! :)

Their white noodle is awesome. Big portion is enough for 4 people. Service is not so good. Ordered iced drinks but served us with hot one. Ordered large portion for white noodle but served us with small portion. Ordered large portion for the egg yet again served us small portion. The drinks n white noodle they changed for us. But when queries about the egg, the staff told us to order another plate instead. Overall, i will visit again due to their awesome white noodle. Their dishes are pretty decent too.

Heard a lot about this place and decided to try. Surprisingly good bee hoon and other dishes, too. Price was ok, if you skipped the drinks, GST & service charge. For S$15 I get a really big bowl of bee hoon for 4, with generous amount of seafood in it~

Live up to the standard of quality of the food at a fairly reasonable priceWe ordered 8 dishes including the White Bee Hoon (L), it costed us around S$123 with few drinks + a beerTheir signature white bee hoon is a must to order, mixed with the chilli sauce, fantastic!As for the rest of the dishes, tasted quite good tooFew things to take note, they don't offer hot or warm water, you can only get their bottle mineral water. They don't offer tissue (dry) too, has to pay for their wet tissue ($0.30), I can understand most of the restaurant charge for wet tissue, but quite surprised there isn't any dry tissue paper.This restaurant didn't take any reservation, and it is not difficult to understand why.In short, worthwhile to come as family meals only

The queue at this place says it all: it is worth the trip here and worth the wait. The food is fabulous, and service is good, despite the packed restaurant. I had a good experience and I am most likely to return here again. I do not know what to recommend. Everything I ate today, was GREAT

This is the branch from their original outlet opposite Sembawang Shjopping Centrer. The white rice vermicelli is just as good as the main outlet so was the deep fry chicken wings.The prawn fritters, the main branch is more tasty. The fried spicy Kang Kong is on par with the main outlet.Service is good and prompt.Service attitude is a bit off as the staff was abrupt about the wet wipes usage
