Been there the second time for the morning brunch buffet. Kid eats free for every one paying adult. Great.

We went during lunch time in new year day. A dog friendly place. The waiters seemed tired or over-worked but still maintained good service. Food wise, it is fusion style. Had the clam in wine and it was delicious. Also had calamari and a margarita pizza - both yummy too. Only pet peeve is that the seats outside are beside a pool for kids and there is high chance that splashing might occur. Perhaps the restaurant should provide ponchos for the guest - just in case :

Was told this place does the best burgers in Singapore. Not quite sure about that but certainly very good. Cooked how you like (medium) and served with all the usual fixings, this was one great burger. Good friendly service and a great choice of beers too
4
We had a birthday event here, and were able to reserve a private corner overlooking the beach. Food wise was pretty decent, and service was friendly when they were present; trouble with a private corner would be the lack of attention
4
Overall a great place to gather with friends for some grub and live football matches. Ambiance was good and comfortable for dining
4
Was there with my wife and 5-year old on a Saturday for lunch. Upon sitting down, the friendly staff brought some coloring pencils with a coloring page for my daughter. That's really attentive and thoughtful.We ordered steak and baby ribs. Portions are good. I enjoyed the steak. The baby ribs are somewhat a little too sweet though

SandBank ,Located at 920 East Coast Parkway#01-28/32 Parkland Green, Sandbank opened its doors in November 2014 is new additions to the sister outlet of the “The Bank Bar”, located in Shenton Way. Sandback is suited in a brand new and contemporary Parkland Green development overlooking the ocean, it has ample parking spaces, and An unique 15m plunge pool spanning the front of the outlet; with a third of the pool dedicated to children and the other two thirds offering adults an area for a cooling plunge and place to sip on a cocktail. Sandbank has a casual, family-friendly feel, befitting of its laidback location. We spent a wonderful afternoon with friends at this restaurant. The food here is ok, and the prices aren't unreasonable, about the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect afternoon, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend visit

This place is a lovely bar along east coast park and it's just a stones throw from The beach (ok, I exaggerate, maybe 3 stone's throw ). For a bar that's along a park connector notorious for its cheap hawker good on one end, and expensive but popular seafood on the other, this place is a welcome neighbour that provides affordable western fare (and occasional eastern specials, like the shabu shabu special they have on right now). It's your local pub but along the ECP (and but it's not very local in the sense that you'd have to cross an expressway via underpass or overhead bridge to get there ).We had the 200gm sirloin steak and it was done to perfection (we asked for med rare), juicy soft and tender, and the accompanying jus was delicious. You can even taste a bit of the char grill as promised .... hence the edge was crispy and delectable.The oysters were yummy (this time they were from Canada), and the lobster pasta with chilli crab sauce was not too shabby either. Their homemade chocolate lava cake was divine.The service was excellent. Wendy was perfect as usual (please give this girl a raise already!) and the two girls under her charge were also efficient and friendly. All qualities of a good establishment that's properly run with good management.Definitely would recommend comin here.

Had a family at Sandbank recently. Despite a last minute addition, the folks (at Sandbank) still managed to accommodate the 9 of us. We managed to try the oven baked snapper, baked lobster, clams in wine, seafood bisque, washed down with a bucket of iced cold Tiger Black. The highlight was the grilled sampler, which had portions of beef and chicken
4
I went there on a saturday morning for breakfast buffet for friends gathering. The service was very good.
4
Well set up for kids with pool, and right in front of beach/east coast park. Colouring pencils etc. food tasty and reasonable. Staff/service adequate but generally slow/inattentive and not very friendly.
4
I was there to watch the man utd match with my Boyfriend. We ordered two mains, the baby back ribs and the sirloin steak. Both were tasty but the portion was slightly small. Overall, the atmosphere was nice. I recommend to make reservations if you are heading there to watch a match too as they had a full house during match day. Will be back again.
1
The price is the most expensive. The service is very very poor and staff are inattentive. The manager is the worst offender since he is obviously not managing the restaurant and his staff very well. For this price you can get better Spey and service in lots of other places. Nearby many good places to eat. Don't NR need to waste your $$$$ here.
4
Had buffet breakfast. Not huge selection but enough. Has local food like laksa, prawn noodles. Egg station, bread, cereals, fruits. Nice place and staff are friendly. Hashbrown is nice. Porridge is salty. No water available. Cheese tofu is nice. There is a swimming pool for kids outside which is nice
3
Very limited choices for breakfast and some choices run out fast. Replenish speed is slow. Tasteless egg Benedict.
5
Great place though the 5 starswas for the girl that joined me there, she was perfect. Thanks to Sandbank for hosting us.
4
Sandbank is a nice corner of East Coast which is quite quiet and really a good place to have a drink after a long day. I enjoyed the tranquil feeling and good selection of beer on ta
5
We stopped here for a cool beer and a wine after a very pleasant walk though the East Coast Parkway Parkland green. The service was excellent and we had a table with a nice beach and sea view. There was free entertainment in an area outside. We did not have a meal but others around us were enjoying various meals in the very nice laid out bar area.Yes a nice way to spend an hour
5
We were taken here by our local friends. It's a large spacious restaurant similar style to a US sports bar but far more fun. The young staff were really attentive and the food excellent, recommend the pizza, steak and most especially the crab if it's on. It was amazing!! The location is raised above the East Sea coast with a great view. Highly recommended.
4
With a splashing pool outside the restaurant for kids to play around, the Sandbank definitely has a great anbience for a weekend catch up with friends. With an exquisite food fare of Italian (though not a great variety for venegratians), it was a great time
3
Decent service, average food, friendly service but nothing out of the ordinary. Great location for a relaxing bite and drink after a good walk with the kids on the beach. If it was not for location, not many would come here.
5
this place is really a hidden gem. its interior gives off the vibe of a typical sports bar, chill and relaxing, with an outdoor pool facing the sea, but it serves good food. we ordered the sampler platter to try their 4 main mains, and was surprised at the quality of the steak and chicken. the ribs were decent as well but could do with more bbq sauce, while the fish was also decent but could have been more moist. came here for our anniversary dinner, which i called in in advance to make reservations, and they were very nice to have given us a complimentary dessert cake with celebratory messages written over. will come back again

Had dinner with my visiting Godparents from USA and enjoyed out ribeye steak and honey glazed ribs. Ordered the clam in white wine sauce and its one of the best we had. The sauce is more of a pot of broth with all the tasty clams soak in it. A much try.The ribeye steak was tender and succulent and the ribs was very delicious.The restaurant tucked in the corner of the cluster of eateries was not so rowdy compared to the other joints. Only complaint is the clam chowder soup - not up to expectation, maybe I am so used to a much richer soup with chunky fish, clams and potatoes type- of chowder
4
Attended a baby shower, and it was great. Buffett food served are fruits, fries, pizza, tomato pasta, potato salad etc. The service is very good, staff are very patient (there were kids running around, and balloons every where etc) and always keep a smiling face. The service staff is very efficient. food at the buffet corner is constantly being replenished and the fruits platter are a good mixed of dragon fruits, water melon, grapes & melon. The service staff swiftly assist with the cake cutting once it is completed, and consciously clear finished plates from the guest table. Unsure of the charges for such events, but definitely a place for consideration as they have good food, awesome service staff and a choice of both indoor and outdoor seats with Swimming pool for the kids to have some fun with! Thank you sandbank and your team for a great Sunday afternoon.

My husband brought me to this restaurant during Christmas Eve for dinner. Quite amazed by their food and serving portion. Will definitely return here again next time.
5
Food was good & affordable. Ambience was lovely, with a (somewhat) view of the beach. Service was good too
4
I had the x Mas set( which was at an affordable price) which comes with 1) scallop appetiser ( delicious with perfectly cooked scallops and a yummy sauce 2) butternut Squash and Apple soup. ( sweet on its own but goes well with the Garlic bread) 3) for mains I had the cod fish. ( was good but not Super amazing) 4) caramelised banana choc ice cream and macaroons ( macaroons was tad too sweet but the banana and ice cream was the perfect ending )  My partner shared the appetisers and soup with me he had the Aussie rack of lambs which was tender and cooked so well. Yumms!!! Service was attentive . Would definitely come back ! Thumbs up!!

SandBank is a great place for that Sunday brunch. It has a huge buffet with Continental and Asian food, from waffles and pancakes and croissants to chicken porridge and laksa. The service is warm and friendly, and like almost every place in Singapore, you can ask for a baby chair. And the buffet is really worth going back for again and again. Plus it's right on the beachfront, so you can have a dip, shower off and come in with a big appetite - it's worth it
5
Enjoyed the lobster with a huge serving of chilli crab pasta. Yummy! Its proximity by the sea is also a plus
4
It's our second visit and the food variety have improved by leaps, which was a result of new owners. The pasta and pizzas did not disappoint and the Italian seafood broth was excellent. A few local dishes like the melt-in-the-mouth char siew was a pleasant surprise. Service is efficient and friendly, plus we enjoyed the seafront location, definitely a nice place to chill out with friends and family. We will be back for sure.
4
Food was OK, nothing that stood out for me. Servings were quite small so was still hungry when we had finished. Chill out music on a Friday evening so nice place to relax.
4
Nice family oriented restaurant. Swim pool at rear. Good menu choice and staff very amenable. Food very good
5
A happy spot anytime with family, friends or colleagues! Food menu is well thought through. Love the idea of sharing platters. Staff get friendly over time and we went crazy on the drinks too. A place for any time, anyone!
5
Love sandbank. Used the entertainer app and took their deals on their house vodka. Makes it great value for that area. Staff friendly and a lovely spot for a lazy afternoon with the family.
3
Nice atmosphere and a good place for casual dining. Service was good, they had full attention on our group. Food was alright. There's a swimming pool for kids too.

We visited Sandbank for lunch last weekend and discovered a terrific location for weekend lunch by the sea. The restaurant was not very busy as we went there only around 2pm, a bit late by local lunch timings.The place carries a good variety on its menu, and I would recommend their pizzas & salads which we quite enjoyed.The servers are friendly and responsive. To round up the meal, I'd recommend a nice stroll in East Coast Park along the beach

My family and I went to Sandbank on 2nd Sept 2016 for buffet lunch and were very happy with the quality of the food, the spread of food (see photos) and the service. The mini beef steaks, prawns, calamari rings and mixed vegetables as well as blueberry panna cotta dessert were excellent. The other foods were good except the Steamed Pork Soft Bone with Black Beans was too salty. We did not get to taste Laksa, Fried Fish Beehoon Soup, Spring Rolls and Deep Fried Fish Fillet with Soybean Sauce because we had already eaten as much as we could. Moreover the last item did not look appetising.We were pleasantly surprised that the price of buffet (S$25.90 + 10% Service Charge + 7% Tax before discount) included orange juice in addition to ice-cold water as well as tea or coffee.We were lucky that the restaurant was offering promotion (we were told till end of this month), where adults, seniors and children were given 30%, 50% and 50% discounts respectively.When we visited, parking space was plentiful. However the problem was locating the restaurant in such a large place. It is located at the end nearer to the car park entrance. Google Map gives the correct location of Sandbank eatery

My husband and I were welcomed in by friendly staff. We ordered the fish (sea bass) and chips, grilled seabass and truffle fries. They served water and entertained our request for malt vinegar to go with the chips. Tables had a warmly lit electric candle. There was a swanky kids pool for patrons. Did I mention it was our wedding anniversary? It was a good experience with fine food (about $19+ for mains and $8+ for truffle fries) and we would be happy to go back
4
There is a nice ambience when I entered the bar/restaurant. You can choose to sit on the patio or inside and the staff are very friendly and helpful. They have a big menu and the price ranges from $15-40, which I think it is a little pricey. It is a great place to hang out with friends after cycling and it is also family friendly. I had the calamari and the ice lemon tea. Calamari is delicious and not the typical calamari (squid rings) that I've eaten. Would definitely recommend to come to this restaurant and being friends/family too!

We purchased the entertainer app which offers us one-for-one main course privileges. To our surprise the restaurant said that they were "different" and all food items on the menu were part of the promotion. These include garlic bread, fries, soup and other appetizers and side dishes. Would have expected it to be explicitly mentioned since the promotion was clearly stated to redeem one MAIN COURSE free for one ordered. We were only informed at the end of our meal
5
Great casual restaurant by the sea. We had spring rolls, avocado bruschetta and chicken satay burger. It was DELICIOUS!
4
The restaurant serves the western food and drink with the reasonable prices. The prices printed on the menu are net.
4
Celebrated my son's first year birthday at this outlet and food was fantastic, location and amenities were awesome - kept everyone occupied and entertained for hours!Service staff were pleasant and every ready to assist.Certainly worth visiting and returning, similar to their other outlet The Bank Bar & Bistro
4
This is my usual chill out place with my family and friends. They serve great western food from appetizer to main course. I like the truffle fries, stem fish, grill set with pork ribs, steak, fish and chicken. To my surprise, they serve buffet breakfast as well. Not much variety but enough to have a wonderful start of the day.
4
The ambiance was like a sports bar. It wasn't too much crowded. They have a plunge pool just near the rear entrance for customers to drink and plunge. The nachos and pasta were good, the sandbank seafarer was average. The wine was very smooth, so was the cocktail
5
We went early one Sunday evening: we were 5 adults and 5 kids between 4 and 12 years of age. Service was excellent - nothing was too much effort for the waitstaff (I have allergies and my kids are fussy eaters so I had many requests e.g. dressing on side, eggs bolied not poached, less salt etc) and the waitstaff were patient and very accomodating. Food came quickly and was of very high quality. Both adults and kids enjoyed their meals. The kids LOVED the plunge pool ... staff were tolerant and no complaints or sour faces about our screaming children! Lovely setting and good value for money. Would definitely return so thank you Sandbank for a lovely evening out
5
A day out with the family, essentially to celebrate HOLI, Indian festival of colours.Sandbank is a superb place to wine and dine.A great selection of seafoods, fast food, salads and the omnipresent BEER!Service is excellent and very customer friendly....They never say NO....YES BUT:-

Sandbank combines a laid back ambience with great food. We went there for lunch, hot and sweaty after a long walk along the East Coast Park. Sandbank is breezy, has comfortable seating and even a swim/paddle area for kids. The staff is very tolerant of little kids running around all over the place. Admittedly, it's a little noisy but you wouldn't mind that so much if it's your brat that generating most of it.We had a pizza, an arugula salad and clams in white wine sauce. All awesome and reasonably priced
3
We visited Sandbank for drinks and dinner with friends. The restaurant has a casual atmosphere, suitable also to families with kids. The many TV screens are a bit disturbing and give somewhat of a sports bar feeling, that's a pity. If you prefer to sit outside you will need to reserve a table. Ceiling fans inside are nice because it can be humid at East Coast Park and the restaurant's doors are open. Food was good; drinks are pricey. Service was OK. Would probably go back
4
We've been here a few times on a Sunday night for dinner with the kids. A great location on the East coast for the kids to go off and play whilst you watch the world go by with a glass of wine. There is a good variety of food, of varying quality. We usually have the steak but have tried the burgers before and the Pizza is a bit random. All in all its great for an easy relaxed Sunday Dinner with the Kids.
