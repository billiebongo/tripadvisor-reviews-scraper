Good Value Set Lunches for Naan and Briyani. Its one of go to places for a quick and good Indian meal. The naans are good. One small complaint is that they always forget to serve water when asked at the beginning of the meal.

We had vegetarian food & it was quite nice. The portions were good and taste was pretty close to authentic food back home. Service was decent and staff quite polite. The food is not too expensive either.

First visit ordered fish-head curry, fish not fresh.
Another visit, ordered naan with butter chicken set lunch. Butter chicken too sweet and does not go with naan. Taste was all wrong.
Seatings too cramped, got to push table get in and out the seats.

We ordered the dosage, South Indian Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian meals. The food was good and promptly served. Thank you.

I have had many meals here and always been excellent. Everything is freshly prepared. Highly recommended will be back!

we only order the vegetarian dishes and nearly all of them have been great. No trouble except for a slightly bland palak paneer. Dahl makani is my favourite, and their garlic naans are just right. The masala chai tea was a perfect finish to a satisfying Indian meal

We have had a lovely and delightful experience at the restaurant. The owner and his wife were generous in their servings and displayed hospitality to our team when we were there for dinner last Friday. The food was delicious and tasty! One of the best Indian food I ever tasted in Singapore

1) ambiance- really really mediocre. I would recommend sitting outside. Despite being hot, it will still be better than inside2) service - the staff is very courteous and forgetful. Our order was forgetten and so was the courtesy of water to start3) food - Oily but what did you expect from curry. The bartender's drinks were well made4) Price - definitely economical but difficult to acces

My husband, daughter and I decided to try Curry Garden at Hillv2. Had to wait to be seated. There were a few tables empty but tables not cleared. We ordered masala dosa, butter chicken, paneer Kadai and tandoori roti. This is the first restaurant where we paid even before the food was served. Apparently restaurant was closing and the manager had to go to JB. Talk about being rushed. The food was so- so. Small portions and not spicy at all. The chicken sauce was lukewarm and rage paneer didn't even seem like what we wanted. I wanted grated paneer and even asked the waiter when ordering. We were given a few chunks of paneer with lots of onions. Won't recommend this place at all. It's a shame as it's the only Indian restaurant in Hillv2. Totally disappointing experience

Curry Gardenn was recommended by a friend as one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore and did not disappoint. The chicken and lamb were both delicious and spicy and the garlic naan was perfect. The service was very good and we were given good recommendations. The only slight criticism is the lack of decor and ambience

Have been coming here regularly for over a year and this establishment has never failed to impress. Also well-known in my social circle.
Food, ambience, location, pricing and especially service are amazing.

Curry fish head was an excellent choice . Service is good and the restaurant have many regular customers . Food not too spicy and the boss RAVI has very good PR . In fact we are one of them . Cheers

Ravi recommend Drums of Heaven to us and we were all IMPRESSED. Tender chicken perfectly BBQ-ed with a dash of mint sauce is simply heavenly. Thanks ; we will be BACK for more !

We tried the Double Onion Chicken, double meaning the onions braised with the chicken in an aromatic sauce, then finished with raw onions. Yummy. The prawn masala was fantastic as was the stir fried ocra. Try their naans. Complimentary papadum was served with a delish minty sauce.

Today I had lunch at this restaurant – my friend ordered a vegetarian set and I a fish briyani set. The fish that came with the briyani set came with a few pieces fried in bread crumbs/batter ??– This is the 1st time I have seen this. When I asked the waiter he says its as per the picture. Please take a good look at the "picture" and see if u can see the fish clearly ! Also since he pointed to the picture I see a bowl of curry and when I asked him how come I don’t have any curry he pointed to someone , shouted at the back where is the curry etc.You make s statement about picture & dont don’t serve correctly and really what a disappointing fish briyani,IF I know its pcs of fish (cant really tell ) fried in batter I wont order. From Zam zam /Tasneem/muthus/samys / Apolo banana leaf / ABC in duku and many other restaurants in Singapore, never have I received this type of fish with a “fish briyani” After 47 years in Singapore I think I know what briyani should be like!.Really dissapointed 
4
We had the dum mutton briyani, special chicken (like tandoori) and paneer palek (cottage cheese with spinach) and they were superb! It's also noteworthy to mention the masala gravy that was served with the papadum at the start - simply delicious and goes well with rice or naan as well. While the serving staff were polite and ever ready to see to our needs, the owner even came to check if we liked the food and took the opportunity to explain how each dish is prepared. We will definitely return to sample the rest of the dishes!

Dropped by for family dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the welcoming staff who provided valuable advice on our food choice. Sensing that we were keen on chicken brayani, they suggested we try an assortment of chicken brayani. In the end, we settled on fried chicken, butter chicken and chicken tikka. It was a real treat for the family and we'll definitely be going back for more

Visited with family on the day of Eid! Nice ambience but bit cramped with limited space. The staff were very courteous! Ordered some starters bhajji platter and it was good. The biryanis did not taste like biryani but the butter chicken and tandoor prawn was good. Expensive food but the food was just average!

We were there for Father's Celebration.Ordered curry fish head at $28 and a chicken dish.Plain water was not automatically served and we had to request.Feel this should be improved as most of the dishes are spicy.Our glass of Teh Tarik were unable to kill the spicy taste

How different can Indian food get ? Not a lot ...specially in Singapore which spoils you for choice. But what gives Curry Garden the edge over the others is the great host and staff who will go out of the way to personalise your experience. Great job considering the restuarant is always packe
4
Food is good and staff helpful and efficient. It can get a bit crowded with little floor space so luck your time! Very good curries.
5
Very good food, friendly staffs, nice environment will recommend to all my friends and relatives about this lovely place. Please visit once and enjoy their mouth watering food with your beloved family.
5
Excellent curry dishes with friendly and helpful staff and great home delivery service. And best value fro good Indian restaurant food in Singapore
5
Lots of choices for curry and every dish tastes so good!! The mango lassi was also lovely! Naan was a little disappointing. It was prepared ahead and placed in the warmer so it didn't taste as good.
5
Superb selection of North and South Indian dishes. Their vegetarian options are also a must-try. The chicken masala cannot go wrong!
2
Ordered the mee hoon goreng and fried chicken. 2 dishes I won't advice you to order. Mee hoon was super salty and chicken was tasteless and ended up eating more flour. This place use to be quite good thus am sorely disappointed by the drop in standards

This review is on their restaurant at Hillv2. The last time I came here, they were newly opened and I swore I will not come back again. Food was that terrible. Not much choice today ended up there again. I should say the quality of food had definitely improved a lot. The restaurant was crowded. A testament that the food was good. Price and quantity served was reasonable. Will recommend

Usually, I am very impressed with the high standards of service and food at the Curry Garden in turf city, however the past few visits, I have been appalled by the restaurant. The previous time, the food took 45 mins to arrive on the table, and a further 10 minutes for the naan to arrive. We were waiting for a chicken saag for another 30 mins until they realised that the kitchen had run out of spinach! Highly disappointed with the sloppy Butter chicken that they served as a substitute. We decided to give the restaurant one last shot, but was even more underwhelmed by everything. Service was apalling with there being hardly any waiters. The plates came out filthy, so we had to wipe them down ourselves. Then after ordering, it took another 30 mins before food arrived, but was stone cold. Had to send back two dishes as they were just too cold, due the lack of service. It was also very hard to communicate with staff, as it took two waiters to take down a simple order! The chicken biryani was way too spicy even after asking for it very mild. The only highlight was the little pieces of tandoori chicken that we ordered, apart from that, I had one of the worst culinary experiences for a long time. Would not recommend to anyone

We (3 friends) went to newly opened curry garden at HillV2 located at Hill view avenue on 6th Aug 2015 for dinner. We ordered fish tikka, chicken 65, pepper chicken, fish masala and roti. Both chicken 65 and pepper chicken were terribly bad. Have you seen onion bujji in chicken 65? They said this is our style. All chicken pieces were in different shapes and mostly bone with some flesh. Pepper chicken was very dry and the chicken tasted like very old one. Only saviour was fish items atleast filled our stomach. Doubt will go again

We ate at the Curry Gardenn in Turf City as well as Hillview Rise. The food doesn't taste as good as it did when I first ate there a few years ago. At Turf City, the Butter Chicken was too sweet, and the flavour of the other dishes seemed diluted. Today, at the Hillview branch, the food was ok but not great. We had fish head curry, chicken and mutton briyani, palak paneer and butter chicken. The naan was a bit rubbery. The mango lassi tasted a bit grainy and too sweet. Service at both places however was very good. An hour after our meal, I had a dry mouth -- MSG syndrome?-- which often happens to me after eating Asian food in Singapore restaurants

Not a fancy restaurant, but the quality of food and service made our dinner.
We had a fantastic butter chicken and mutton. Always friendly and fast.
Outdoor sitting is not big, but nice. Good for going with friends.
5
Food tastes light and fresh. The chicken biriyani set is outstanding value and quality rolled in one ! The vegetarian options are delicious and the wholemeal chapatti had a home made quality, and was freshly made and it's a healthy roasted option. Highly recommended ..

Fresh ingredients, great service, friendly, and good value. My regular haunt with family and loving it always.

Impressed by the food, service and price. Liked that we could order both roti and naan. Not a great selection of wine.

I hope I am writing the review for the correct outlet of the Curry Gardenn. At least, I got the two Ns for gardenn right. I made a reservation for 10 pax by calling the number shown in its website. I spoke to a Mr Dinggu whom I later found out works for another outlet of the restaurant! My friends and I arrived at the Turf City outlet on a crowded Saturday afternoon without a table! Hungry folks are angry folks. But the restaurant manager quickly mollified us by promising us a table soon and when my last guests arrived, the table for 10 was ready. The service was excellent. The manager pre-ordered for us while we were waiting for our table. So we ate almost immediately when we were seated. Papadams came first so we have something to munch before the main courses arrived. We trusted the manager and were not appointed with his selection of aloo gobi, tandoori chicken, chicken cooked two ways, lamb curry, mixed veg and of course, fish head curry. The krombacker and curry goes down really well. The service was great and we left certainly happier than when we first arrived.

Visited on a Sunday mid afternoon. The restaurant was busy and every member of staff was happy and smiling. The service was fanatic and food great. A really good selection of wine by the glass, refreshing and well chilled. Great value for money will definitely go again.

If you live nearby (or even if you don't) you should come here at least once. Not just for the food, which is heavenly, but for the surroundings. There's a jetty nearby and after dinner, you can just go walk off the excess calories! Been here 4 times already and unlikely to stop. The food is simply divine! Spices are so rich and the taste is so authentically Indian! So far I have not ordered anything I didn't like yet! Spice level is also adjustable so no worries about it being too spicy or not spicy enough.Service is excellent. Some of the staff do not speak very good English and yet they put in so much effort to help you select food, talk to you, ask you if you need more drinks, give the kids balloons, help them wash hands. You HAVE got to try it out

The indian resturant is located at "Old Turf club". The foods without MSG ! No coconut Milk! It is different from traditional indian resturant! (Healty Food!!!) The Prata and naan with curry Chicken are not oily, Nice and tasty. You also can order fruit juice from the resturant!Most of the customers are non-indian . I.e. Many Chinese and European like this resturant. It is quite crowded during lunch and weekend normally not easy to find a seat! For smokers, you can selecting the seats outdoor (non-air conditional room). It is quite windy at night. The staffs are very friendly and you can really enjoyed the foods.(If it is your first visit, you can asking them to recommending the food) I believe you will visit this resturant again!After your lunch, you can shop at near by shops , supermarkert and even the outdoor "american football game" especially during weekend around evening hours

Had the set meal Naan with boneless mutton. Very filling. Tasty mutton. My friends loved their set meals with butter chicken but not white rice with chicken. The white rice is not as good as bryani even though the chicken was good. Teh halia (ginger tea) and the yoghurt drink (lassi mango) were tasty and not too sweet.Service was good and prompt. They will recommend your meals if you are not sure of the menu. Restaurant is at the northern part of the 'Grand Stand' and also has Al Fresco section, usually used by smoking customers. This section and air-con section about same size - can hold about 30 customers each

We were at Currry Garden last week but make a 2nd trip today.We had Chicken Tikka with Curry, and Rogan Josh, Naan, Briyani Rice, Plain Dosa. All 3 of us ( me, my wife and my elder dotter ) had an unanimous verdict : SUPERB ! In addition, we love the Mango Lassi which was thick, and creamy.Before we left, we were looking at other tables, seeing what others are having so that we can order on our next trip.Ahhhh... rem to look for Ravi ( The Boss ) who will recommend the best which is not in the menu
