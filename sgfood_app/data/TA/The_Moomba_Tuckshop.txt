Besides just having the Singapore River in front to the joint, you can step outside n enjoy some cool breeze in the evening. The cheese n wine selection is well stocked and prices reasonably. The owner manages the place well, clean and simple. A few drinks and chit chat with friends and colleagues after a hard day's work is called for at this convenient meeting place. Thumbs up for a hidden gem of a place

When I worked in the CBD, this is where I liked to go for a treat. It's rather small and hence cramped (I reckon many people take-away or call for delivery rather than eat on site), but that doesn't mean variety isn't good. I usually have two salads on a plate--if you're not there too late there is a selection of 4-5 salads. I really like their bean + chicken salad, and pumpkin chorizo. Thai chicken is nommy too, though more sweet and tangy. Once in a while there are seasonal specials, such as a turkey salad around Christmastime. Coffee is excellent, though I do feel there are better places for dessert
