Love this place on a Friday /Saturday night. Good Italian fare with an excellent ambience with the live music.
4
Their food was really good and had generous portions, especially the Pizza's. Lives up to the name. Also the ambience was very nice
4
Wine is very good, service is good, pizza is average. Bervages list is good. Too much pork dishes on the mains
4
I enjoyed my Italian dinner at the lively vicinity of Bussorah Street. The only issue I had was with one of the servers who was a bit clueless about things.
5
Visited Fabbrica after having a craving for proper Neapolitan pizza. Although nothing is quite like pizza from Naples, the pizza here is excellent! Great dough, crust and tomato base.
Good choice of Italian beer too. The golden ale bites del Perugia is fantastic.
4
The pizza selection is very good, nice dough with great ingredients like porcini mushroom, scamorza and great buffalo mozzarella. Interesting variety of craft beers and lively atmosphere.
3
Pizzas was legit. Food was great.
As it was my first time visit, asked the service staff for recommendations which wasn't really helpful.
Food was great though. Service could have been better
5
Waiting time was short and service was adequate.
I have to say, in terms of it's food, this is by far one of the best Italian restaurants i have been to.
4
The Oktoberfest sausage specials were delicious - proves that you're both great in your pizzas and more...! Fantastic band too
4
Had an early dinner at around 6.30. As to be expected I did not get the best table as I was just by myself. So what. Ordered a Fig Salad and a Pizza with Italian Sausage and Peperoncino. The salad arrived promptly after about 5 minutes. Bed of rucalo, 1 ript sliced fig and some pine nuts. Nicely done, the balsamico on the rucola was very sweet, I assume there is some sugar involved. Overall a nice starter.The pizza was excellent. Clearly coming from a wood oven, crispy crust on the outside, moist in the centre. Very good ingredients, the sausage and the mozzarella are clearly above average from a quality perspective. To my taste the peperoncini (red and greeen chili) were cut a bit too coarsly, they were actually quite big chunks. Chopping them finer would allow to spread the aroma and spice more evenly across the pizza. Overall, a very nice pizza! Service was quick, attentive and friendly
4
tried the restaurant a few days back. Very nice Pizza. Unfortunately I did not manage to try their pasta dishes.
5
Tasty and soft pizza with thin crust, exactly the way I like my pizza. Nice decor and very good service. My friend had a risotto and panna cotta and was pleased too. Their beers on tap is a nice touch.
4
Pizzas never fail here! The dough and ingredients are fresh and there is a great selection of pizzas to choose from.
Definitely try the tartufo dessert too!!!
4
Serves very good pizza. Service can be better though.
Outdoor seating available and it's in the vibrant Arab Street area.
5
Had a wonderful experience! Great, fresh ingredients- pizzas w the right kind of crust, thin enough in the Centre w some bite on the edges, for me! Great quality burrata! Also had a great Italian beer w the meal...complemented it very well.
5
I liked the gourmet pizzas because they have ingredients that are a rarer to find in Singapore, but still authentic italian. Definitely all the pizzas are a must try.
Good range of cocktails, especially my fav Negroni.
5
Enjoyed their Fennel Sausage Pizza and their Ravioli Agnello for lunch. Prices are what you expect to pay in Singapore for this type of restaurant. Great tasting and fresh! Finished with two glasses of wine. Service was excellent. Handy location to our hotel Pan Pacific Serviced Suits. Great place for dinner also better atmosphere and I have heard they have a band playing in the evening
4
I was very pleasantly surprised to find this pizzeria so close to Arab Street. Service was friendly, and there was a good choice of wine, beer and soft drinks, including my favourite, which is quite hard to come across outside Europe - San Pellegrino in Chinotto flavour. The pizzas themselves we as delicious as some I've had in Italy , with an excellent tomato base and very good cheese. Ingredients were obviously carefully sourced. It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for
4
well that is not the place I was going for a pizza. it's in the middle of an Arab quarter, with shops and restaurants that offer arab products and foods. The place is really nice and worth a visit. As I happened to be there, we saw this Italian restaurant and wanted to give it a try.All the pizzas and pastas that we ate were very good. I give it 4 stars only because I found the crust of the pizza that was too burnt and too salty for my taste. Other than that, I recommend i
5
Best pizza in Singapore, hands down! While it may be a bit pricey, it's very authentic and the ingredients used are fresh and high quality. Even my friends who are from italu praise the pizza here, so definitely go. Recommend the burrata pizza and the fig one!
5
One of the best wood fire Pizzas I've ever had in SG. good selection of craft beers which went well with the pizza.
5
Not on Haji Lane but close by is this sweet little pizzeria. I would advise booking. All doors and windows along the front were open so you can watch the world go by. Food tasted great and the staff were lovely.
4
Food is quite good. Loved the pizza special with swordfish carpaccio and also the crabmeat pasta. It's a pity there's no happy hour here. Service is a bit slow
4
The foods are a little pricey but certainly worth all the qualities and freshness. Personally liked the risottos and the artisan 32-Curmi beers a lot! Great live band on Saturday night. Can't wait for my next visit.
1
the pizza burnt on the edge and soggy in the middle.
Also the dough was insipid..... horrible experience!!!!!
4
Good pizza, always go for Margarita with mozzarella Di bufala. Staff is always kind, serving you a piece of homemade focaccia to start the meal. Good for dates and groups
1
had a Mediterranean pizza which had cheese, tomato and olives. I think the dough was not rolled evenly , ended up too thin at the centre an thick and mushy on the sides. Not crispy at all on the sides.We did mention our disappointment to the attendant, and he did not apologize or acknowledge that we were let down. So, all in all, poor food and indifferent service.
1
I've been before and it was good, so was really surprised when my recent trip with a group of friends was so terrible. One main meal arrived before the starters, the drinks took what seemed like an age to arrive, and then three of our group didn't even get their meal at all. The management was very apologetic, which eased the disappointment to a degree (but not the empty stomachs of some), but the battle to get the bill sorted and some food that we hadn't even ordered removed, made the experience a complete disaster. Such a shame.
4
I have been on the hunt for the best margherita pizzas the past few weeks and this is one of the best yet.Delicious char on crust, check. Crispy crust and soft interior, check. Flavourful crust, check. Balance between crust, char, and sauce, check.At this point the buffalo mozzarella and basil leaves (all 2 leaves of it...) aren't that important now. =PThat's how great pizzas are like in my book; the crust is everything and this one is perfect.Extra points for wine and beer pairing charts in the restaurant too, but wished the waiter would have recommended me a drink though
4
Hidden within Arab street zone, this Italian restaurant offers authentic italian pizza and awesome Risotto! Love the truffle poccini mushroom risotto which reminds me of my meal in Milan. Wide selection of pizza and booze to pair your food with. Last but not least, service was good with waiter really attentive to our need
5
This is our favorite in Singapore. Very good casual Italian! Pizza is just like in Italy from an authentic Italian pizza oven. Very nice staff. Open air seating and live music on the weekend. HIGHLY RECOMENDED
3
The place has a great Italian beer selection and the risotto was decent, although a little more on the plate wouldn't go astray
4
We tried two pizzas, margarita and arugula/prosciutto and both had dark crispy edges and top quality ingredients. The tomato sauce was ok, mozzarrella fantastio! I could live without the edgy industrial interior. Micro brews were a wonderful pair.
5
We had a wonderful dinner at Pizza Fabbrica. My wife and myself had a salad to share along with the Capricciosa Pizza - Fresh Mozzarella,Tomato Sauce, Mushrooms, Prosciutto , Artichokes, and Olives. We ordered a beer to go along with the food and it topped it off well
4
Ordered a Tuscan Style Seafood Stew served with Crusty Bread & a Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Rucola, Bresaola (cured-beef), Shaved Parmesan Pizza.The seafood stew was so good we were so tempted to order a second portion but did not as we were too full.Will return again with more friend
5
We were a group of 8. Getting a reservation was easy and we got a complimentary dessert for our friend's birthday. They also played some background music before having to ask for it. The service was fast and interiors contemporary and minimal. The food was very delicious. The risotto, ravioli, pizzas and bruschetta! In love with the place
1
Husband was craving for pizza so googled online and found this restaurant with a Google rating of 4.4. Decided to give it a try. On a Friday night, this place was quite empty with only a few tables occupied. But it didn't bother us much. Settled and ordered an appetiser, a pizza and beer. In less than 5 or 10min, pizza was served. Upon finishing our first slice, the appetiser was served. Wasn't it supposed to have the appetiser served first, upon finished, followed by the main course? Well, we aren't particular about the sequence, it is just that we are unsure which one should we eat first. If we stop and have the appetiser, then the pizza will get cold and soggy. If we finish the pizza first, then it seems weird to have the appetiser later. Anyway, we just eat concurrently, and the pizza just get soggy after our second piece. The appetiser was certainly not to our liking; we struggled to finish it. The pizza? We CHEWED the pizza. So Hard. So soggy. How did it get 4.4 rating? Maybe the beer? The environment? Or your friends? Disappointed. Dominos pizzas are much wayyy better!
5
A pizza outing with some friends brought interesting discovery about Italian beers...32 Via Dei Birrai to be precise. The range of taste from 32 VdB is like having a wine tasting session - light to full bodied, velvety on the palate, fruity to dark roasted coffee... and the pizzas had beautiful 'leopard' spots but just a tad soggy that evening (had better pizzas in a previous visit). Waiters were friendly too...I'll be back
2
Food was lovely. However, I left very disappointed. We had my tiny toddler in our party and I asked what they could do for children, as there was no kids menu. The waiter offered us a choice of pasta with tomato sauce or pasta with cheese sauce, which I said would be great and please to just serve a tiny portion. He happily agreed and we were thrilled to be accommodated. We were served a full portion and subsequently charged an astonishing S$18 for a plate of pasta that my daughter ate about five pieces of. Absolutely happy to pay for her food but I was very specific she only needed a small portion and everyone in my party was under the impression that we were being offered a small (perhaps half sized) portion, especially for children. It was not once mentioned that it would have to be a full sized portion at adult prices. Really left a bitter taste in our mouth after an otherwise delicious meal.
5
I have been on a project in Singapore for nearly 3 months. Given my situation I eat out quite a bit. O Pizza Fabricca by far has the best service of any place I have gone in Singapore. The service, combined with the food, the decor and the great location makes this a definite spot to check out
1
Second time at the place; should have learnt from first time. Limp pizza, insipid flavors for other dishes. Wish I had gone to a kopitiam.
5
Best pizza in Singapore, fantastic Italian fare, knowledgeable and friendly staff, great craft beers from Italy, great location with nice outdoor seating option.
3
The pizza bread was very good but they are not very generous with the toppings. Drinks and desserts are also overpriced. But the environment is nice and service is good. I have seen better pizza place in Singapore
5
Fantastic food and quick service. The menu has a lot of options. We took pizza with beef and it was right choice, very good taste and delicious. I will back again next time
3
The food was nice but too expensive for what you get. I bought a margarita with 8 pieces in a price of 23$.
5
Had pizza and beer in the late evening sitting outside. It was very pleasant and the pizzas were excellent.
Complimentary sparkling mineral water a nice touch.
5
Our first time to Pizza Fabricca and it won't be our last. Excellent and authentic wood oven pizza with an incredible crust. There is a range for the classical pizza connoisseur (read 8 year old Son) and more adventurous. The tomato salad a dream, simple and incredibly tasty. The warm olive appetizer also a great starter. We sat outside in the warm night air and just enjoyed.every.single.bite
5
The whole experience was an absolute delight. I am fortunate to have experienced a lot of excellent meals in my travels across Europe and Asia, and for Italian cuisine, Pizza Fabbrica is certainly near the top of my list of *all-time great venues*.Stumbling across this venue on one quiet Sunday evening just after new year, we took a chance on this restaurant from amongst many options on this street for 3 main reasons: it was busier than most (always a good sign), it appeared very clean (it was, as is the bathroom), and because the front of house didn't hard sell us to eat there (but floated nearby in case of questions).We chose to sit outside in the balmy evening air as the road was closed for the weekend and very soon afterwards a talented trio of guitarists/singers began to perform next to us which was a pleasant surprise.After perusing the menu and being very spoiled for choice, we selected a fig and burrata salad to start (excellent ingredients) before ordering a burrata pizza and gorgonzola with fig risotto. Although there were no specials which was surprising our our server (the manager?) offered to create an alterntive if I had a passion for something off-menu. As the food and musicians were excellent, we then ordered a pannacotta with accompanied by sambuca cherries for dessert which was also exquisite. The whole meal was washed down with a lovely (and inexpensive) robust chianti and free refills of sparkling water, which was a nice touch. It is worth noting that the ingredients were incredibly fresh and the risotto was some of the best I've eaten. Both myself and my companion agreed this was easily one of the best Italian meals we had eaten in Asia, let alone Singapore. On top of this, the service was relaxed yet attentive and they always seemed eager to help when asked, and the entire meal was inexpensive for Singapore.Snapshot...* Service: knowledgeable, attentive and excellent* Food: absolutely top notch!* Ambience: perfect - romantic, * Cleanliness: Very clean* Value for money: for Singapore, this can't be faulted.Overall: I *highly* recommend visiting Pizza Fabbrica - you won't be disappointed! And I for one can't wait to go back for a second sitting
3
We went attracted by some media reviews found in the net.Decor and atmosphere are great indeed, as well the Italian beers both draught and bottled.Our pizza did look soooooo good, pity was still undercooked next to the crust resulting on a chewy unimpressive meal.Some smile and happiness on the waiting staff's face wouldn't have bother ...
3
I was craving for a NY style pizza since a while, when I found this woodfired oven place. Although the pizza crust was fluffy and fresh, but I just didn't like the sauces on top, was too sweet for my taste, just didn't go well with the pizza.
5
pizza crust and toppings were really good and the pricing is super reasonable. service was good too.
4
Had a pleasant experience at Pizza Fabbrica. Great for bigger groupss (we had 9pax). Pizza was pretty good, especially the mushroom one with truffle oil, and the eggplant stuffed with ricotta. Thumbs up (:
3
Quality ingredients used but scarce on toppings and the outer edges of the pizza was more doughy. Not sure if this is a different style of pizza.
4
the food was excellent! will def be back. pastas are flavorful and pizzas are amazing. service is not very efficient but it was afterall a busy night.
2
Only eat here if you want to pay top dollar for a chewy pizza dough with hardly enough toppings (e.g. my parma ham) to distribute across each slice.
3
Great good tasty pasta.beans wer cooked balanced and tomato base sauce perfectly blended ( I hope next time i visit this place they would add more cherry tomatoe on my pasta :-) )
Friendly staff and the place is clean!
4
Had a Quattro Formaggi which was really tasty.Crust is good and pricing is more reasonable compared to restaurants with similar taste.It was a Saturday night when I visited and it had good quality live music performed by three musicians. Tasty pizza a good ambiance close to Arab street. Highly recommended
4
I live in Singapore and I came to this pizzeria few times . Staff is polite and friendly , place is fancy and close to Arab street , quite nice nightlife spot in Singapore , and most of all pizza is yummy and tasty ! Good job guys ! Enjoy 
4
We were there for lunch, which was quite pricey as there were no lunch deals, considering the plentiful dining choices in the neighborhood. Nevertheless our orders of spaghetti carbonara and cured beef-rucola pizza were excellent and worthy of a return visit. The saffron pana cotta was nice though not memorable. Recommend this place if you are looking for authentic Italian food
5
We just wanted a casual, cozy meal and Pizza Fabbrica totally delivered. Service was good, the restaurant was cozy and the street music outside added to the atmosphere of the area. We enjoyed the food a lot and will definitely be back to try other things on the menu
4
Was craving a real authentic pizza and I found it. The sauce was a perfectly seasoned acidic compliment to the mozzarella on a wonderful crust.
5
Went twice to celebrate and on Both occasions thoroughly enjoyed good tasty food. Quick in service and Panna cota was best!!!
5
This is my favorite pizza place. The crust is amazing and the toppings are always fresh and thoughtfully matched. I cannot get enough!
4
Back in Singapore for a business trip, I visited this nice restaurant with my colleagues and business partners. Our group of 9 was served really well and the food was great. I can recommend the starter plate, which is great for sharing. But also the main dishes were delicious. Great italian taste! And the setting of this restaurant in this nice little neighbourhood in Singapore adds to the experience
4
Had tried to get into the Lebanese next door and they were booked out. Ate here Instead bad no expectations but this was truly are wonderful meal. Really enjoyed it. Couldn't fault it from start to finish. Wonderful atmosphere. Very attentive and responsive staff. The manager or host guests was knowledgable and knows how to direct waiters and waitresses. Good was fabulous. Didn't have pizza but the gnocchi was so delicious. Wine was good too. Will be back. With more friends. Ps. Love the carbonated water
4
Good pizza, nice service are a challenge to find in SG. It does exist at Fabbrica! Staff remember my face and quickly acknowledge the party and reservation. Nice beer list. Pizza is thin, slightly chewy with a char to some edges- well done. Ingredients have always been fresh and thoughtful. Complimentary sparkling (or still) water and focaccia are a added bonus. Vegetarian options, YEA
5
This has become one of my favorite places in Singapore. Having tried a broad range of their dishes in numerous visits, I have never been disappointed. The quality is consistently high, all ingredients are fresh and home made. The test case for any restaurant is, from my point of view, pistachio ice cream, because in 90% of all cases, you will get your average ice cream full of artificial pistachio flavour and in an unnatural green colour. A true artisan pistachio ice cream should have a delicate and subtle nutty flavour and look beige/brownish. And guess what, this is exactly what you get at Fabbrica. While I like the pizza, I think this is not the dish where this restaurants stands out significantly compared to others (the rim is a bit too big for my taste). However, I grew especially fond of their excellent home made pasta. Rather unusual for an Italian restaurant, they have an outstanding choice of craft beers, truly appreciated given the Singaporean climate. Last but not least, the staff is very charming and professional
5
Located in a nice spot in Kampong Glam, this is by far the best pizzeria in Singapore. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice, but the food was the main attraction. The bruschetta was lovely and the pizza had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and a lovely soft crust. For dessert, the Tartuffo Clasico was exquisite. I can't recommend it highly enough
3
I came here especially for the pizza after reading all the great reviews. It was very disappointing. The pizzas was more or less tasteless. And chewy, with lots of grease, the crust tasting like it was slightly burnt.  The cheese pizza had big blobs of cheese on it which were constantly falling off. The crust was so soft that one needed to fold the tip inward if one wanted to eat it by hand. The tomato sauce however, was bad. It tasted like it had gone bad, with this kind of overpowering bitter flavour. Very unpleasant.  The Mediterranean pizza was slightly better, but did not live up to the expectations of quality that I had had. There were spicy whole olives on it however, which were good. On the bright side, the pasta was pretty good, as well as the service. We were served small pieces of bread while waiting for our food, which was nice. Decor gave off a simplistic, metallic feel which was pretty good. In conclusion, pizza was not as great as shown by the reviews, but the pasta, service, and decor were all very good
5
Delicious pizza, suggested to us by our Italian friends...so then you know it's good! Very quick service. Pizza and pasta (with fresh truffle) were all as expected. The ambiance is great as they have a nice outside seating area. We were there on a Sunday nights and it was not too busy.
5
OMG: not often I give full score. But combination of price And quality was just perfekt.
Very good quality on ingrediences and dishes. Strongly recommend this place if you look for western food in Singapore.
Bonus: italian beer on tap :)
5
The pizzas are very good. The service is efficient and nice. The street is quite popular on Saturday nights.
3
Easy to find, nice interior with tasty pizza and dessert.
Service staff is nice and accommodating too!
5
I lived in Napoli the home of pizza for 2 years and there pizza although wayyyy more expensive and smaller portion sizes it is to die for. When I miss the Mediterranean, I go here! Worth the money...
5
We ate at Pizza Fabrica and really enjoyed the meal. There's a good choice of pizzas and pastas, and many choices of unusual beers. Book in advance if possible.
5
Went for dinner (two couples) and we loved it. Pizza was amazing and the beer was too. Expensive, but you'd be willing to pay more for the experience.
4
Nice pizzas but they're seriously hard to cut with the base becoming harder as you eat it. You actually get a sore hand trying to carve the thing up. They really should give you a steak knife as a regular knife just doesn't cut it.
5
Had pizza and pasta and they are all delicious. This is a hidden gem in Arab st. Great place to have a get together.
4
Having heard about Fabbrica we thought of giving it a try. The location is great and in the center of Arab street. The staffs are quite nice and friendly. The menue consists of pizza and pasta. The pizzas are proced in mid to high. The size of the pizza is perfect for one person and the same about the pasta.The pizza base is quite nicely baked in the wood fire oven. Well the taste was just nice however the base could be better as it was slighlty chewy and hard to cut it into slices with the steel knife. The ingredients were tasty and sufficient for italian pizza. The tiramisu and gelato as well as pana cotta were tasty and done to perfection. However the tiramisu could better, not much close to a tiramisu in Italy. Also the tiramisu was not chilled properly and thar made the tast a bit unusual.Although the staffs were nice but they did not remember all the ordes properly and they had to be reminded who ordered what. And last bot not least unlike any italian restaurant they didnt serve the normal toast bread. Overal is a good place for gathering and good italian food
4
We were so very glad to stumble upon this little gem of a place serving delicious tasty pizzas from their impressive pizza oven, which can be seen in the restaurant too. We ate here a couple of times and were very warmly welcomed by the rather handsome owner and we were very well looked after by his friendly hard working staff.It is so lovely to find foods other than Asian and it was a much needed break.We thoroughly enjoyed and recommend the trio of mixed bruchetta, absolutely delicious and we also enjoyed a pizza with scallions, goats cheese and mushrooms and panchetta, sorry can't remember the name.It is a welcoming and friendly place to eat, chat and enjoy some time out of the heat or rain and would wholeheartedly recommend this great place with great tasting fresh food. If you are staying at the Park Royal hotel on Beach road then it is opposite down one of the streets facing it
4
Nice authentic Italian cuisine with delicious gourmet pizzas and exclusively Italian beers on tap and in bottles but a 2 course meal for two with a bottle of beer to share plus a pint each came to just under SIN$200
4
My friends and I gathered for my birthday celebration that day and we had an enjoyable evening. The food is delightful and the ambience was great. They even played the birthday song when the cake arrived at our table! Overall a good experience, would recommend!
5
Really impressed with the quality of pizza in this place. Their other Italian antipasti and mains are very nice too. Also good ambience and friendly staff. But really best pizza in Singapore so far!
5
Pizza Fabbrica is a fantastic place to get high quality, ridiculously tasty pizza at reasonable prices. Service is fantastic as well. We love it and we'll be back again and again!
5
The food in this Italian restaurant close to Sultan Mosque was fantastic. The pizza was delicious with perfectly-cooked home-made mass. Noodle dishes were also delicious. The service was kind, fast and efficient. We repeated during our stay in Singapore.
5
Pizza Fabbrica is a super-high-quality pizzeria using real imported Italian buffalo mozzarella cheese. The Margherita pizza is a perfect Neapolitan Margherita and is very reasonably priced at $20. They offer the usual panoply of pizzas, wood fired oven, etc. Indoor and outdoor seating. Highly recommended.
4
Pizzas were fab and you could taste the quality of the ingredients. The mozzarella and pepperoni on the pizza was excellent
5
Delicious pizza, good wine selection, fast service in a very specific, still inviting neighbourhood. Worth experience!
5
Their Pizzas prepared in wood fired ovens is on par with the best that I had in Italy. But prices are a bit on the higher size. The menu also is somewhat limited, when it comes to pastas especially. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. The service too was prompt. Overall a nice experience
5
Me and my hubby walked into this fairly new Italian restaurant on Bussorah Street. We were not very hungry so we just shared a Diavola Pizza which was cooked perfectly in their wood fired oven. Service was friendly and swift.....they serve still and sparkling water on the house. Most of the other Italian restaurants in town push you to purchase expensive bottled water. Other items on the menu looked interested so we will definitely come back to try other dishes
5
Very good quality food and craft beers all the way from Italy. Loved the vibe for a Friday night. One of the best Casual Italian restaurants in Singapore.
5
Amazing bruschettas, pizzas and pastas! We enjoyed ourselves and were pleased to hear they provide delivery too.
5
My boyfriend and I enjoyed our last meal in Singapore at Pizza Fabbrica and loved it. After two weeks in Bali and Singapore eating the local cuisine we craved something a little closer to home and we enjoyed it so much. They have an amazing beer selection and a really good wine by the glass selection which we loved. We shared the antipasto to start and a pizza each and some chocolate gelato after and it was all amazing. Don't hesitate to go here if you want a night off eating noodles, rice and chicken and a great Italian meal!
3
Place is beautiful industrial chic on the interiors with a chill out vibe on the alfresco setting. Food, however, left more to be desired. The risotto could do with more flavors, pizza was a tad dry. As it was a fairly new place, I'll look to them again for improvement. Service was good however
4
I was going to walk by Kampong Glam and on Bussorah Street in Arab Quarter, near Bugis district in Singapore, I have found Pizza Fabbrica, a mystical dining Italian Bar, Pizzeria and Restaurant, Winning Wood-Fired Pizzas that is the new in town. I did stop there for a brunch. It is really one of the few places in Singapore where you can get the taste of authentic Italian taste of food and pizza but also they offer of course a wide range of wine and beers. They recommend to make an online reservation in advance with instant confirmation especially for dinner to avoid the crowd
5
We were looking for a nice but not too spendy place to go for dinner for our anniversary and this was just right. We sat outside in the lane way, which is only open to pedestrians at night. The food was excellent. We had bruschetta (3 kinds on one plate), Parma ham with green salad (very fresh and tasty), and two types of pasta with seafood. Also loved that they had Italian beer on tap. Very happy with attentive service as well.
5
As the name suggests, the restaurant specialises in pizzas and it excels at delivering simple, authentic pizzas. They have a real wood burning pizza oven. We found the pizzas and parma ham and mango salad to be excellent - fresh tasting and well balanced flavour. Also on offer are a great selection of imported Italian craft beers and a matching guide for the food. A lovely diversion from the great variety of Asian food in the area
5
After living in Italy and now living in Singapore, I've been in search of authentic Italian Pizza. Well my search is finally over, Pizza Fabbrica satisfied my craving. Not only the pizza, but the wine and beer are great as well. This is my new favorite place to eat in Singapore.
4
My husband and I wandered here and had an enjoyable evening. Pizza (mushroom and truffle) was good (but not great- despite having plenty of fresh truffle :( ). Pasta (chili seafood) was disappointing- lacked flavor and no chili! But service was great, free still and sparkling water and tastes of beer to find perfect drop
5
I was recommended this place by lots of friends who suggested it's a hidden treasure in Arab Street so I finally decided to try it out with my family. From the moment we entered we felt a warm welcome to be frank is not too common in many local restaurants in Singapore. My 4 year old was hungry so the Chef quickly made some pasta for her while we enjoyed some great Beer and wine and not to mention the free flow of sparkling water along with some cold cuts. We were pleased to taste the freshness of the ingredients.We ordered the fresh truffle pizza which had lots of fresh flavor and delish!! We also ordered some seafood pasta which was a treat. We were recommend to try the Chocolate in olive oil mousse. It was so unique and super flavorful that I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting. I have been to Italy but never tasted something so unique and good.Their Panna Cotta was my daughter's favorite too. Overall we enjoyed our meal and plan to return again.
4
I liked this place... good food, focus on details and intensity... small place, well attended... small and quiet... try the beers menu... waiters requires some improvement in proactivity... happy as overall... recomendable
4
Nice place in a street closed to cars at least saturday evening
Good welcome
We have tested delicatessen and pizza. Ham was excellent and pizza like in Italy
We will come back many times and test everything, and probably put best rating after that
5
very nice location, very friendly staff. Food really fresh (the burratina with rucola was amazingly fresh and tasty).
Seafood pizza was great and the choice of wine was really nice.
Definitely a little part of Italy in Singapore. Will repeat again and again
3
This may sound critical but there are actually very few places around Arab Street that serve good quality middle eastern food. Luckily you don’t have to crave watery baba ganoush and sub-par hummus to spend an evening in this vibrant nook of Singapore. Although I admit that we generally wander to Fabbrica when we can’t get a table at Cicheti on Kendahar, I’ve yet to be disappointed by this joint. The pizza is hot, the ingredients are fresh, the service is fast and most impressive of all you get unlimited refills of sparkling water. The interior lacks a bit of character, so I would recommend sitting outside so that you can properly emerge yourself into the magical setting of this neighbourhood
3
Went to Pizza Fabbrica last night for dinner after being convinced by the good reviews on Chope. The service staff didn't seem to understand what the items in the menu were and we had to keep pointing at what we wanted. They did not seem to understand us a lot of the time. We ordered two starters and three mains and the starters came out first and quickly followed by the mains so the table was full of plates and our mains got cold because we weren't given time to finish our starters before the mains came out. Told the waitress that the food came out too fast and was just offered a smile and a shrug. The food was mediocre, the pizza being the best thing. At $230.00 for a meal for three including a bottle of wine, we found it was expensive for what we got and we will not be returning.

We had a small business dinner here and i followed tripadvisor's list to find a good place. Not disappointed at all! The restaurant is rather small and has 2 or 3 tables outside as well. You can call it a cosy place, so for couples to have a nice dinner, its a safe bet too.Food is excellent, we had antipasti and a tenderloin stake if i recall correctly. With Italian red wine (Montepulciano) you can't go wrong here.Will go here again.

The best tasting Italian food around for those who want a traditional Italian taste. Very good wood fire pizza, varieties of pasta and some awesome deserts. My family and I enjoyed the meal very much. It is priced reasonably for the ingredients used. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Italian food.

We visited this past week on a Wednesday evening. Just perfect for a relaxed and informal evening. A quaint little place on Bussorah Street and away from the hustle of the run-of-the-mill establishments in the vicinity, the white facade of the two shop house lots has a cozy and inviting feeling. Once you step in, the open kitchen with the wood fired pizza oven and the craft beer bar provide a positive vibe. Food is on par with most of the popular Italian restaurants in SG. However, the menu had refreshing twist with new dishes and renditions of some popular ones. If you are a beer lover, you must try this place as they have a unique collection of bottled and tap brews. The wine list has a good selection too. For appetizers, I recommend the burratina which comes with some salad on the side. We also tried the roasted vegetables with ricotta cheese. The Pizza menu has something for everyone's tastebuds and you should definitely try them. For the mains, the truffle risotto was the highlight along with their pasta with asparagus and fresh red peppers (loved the crunchy peppers!). The next time we will want to try the Seabass which is on the specials list. And save the best for the last. For the sweet tooth folks and not, you must try the saffron pannacota with sambuca infused berries (unlike any other), the chocolate cake (contains contrieu) and rum n raisin gelato, and since we try tiramisu in all restaurants we also went for the espresso beer infused rendition here. This place is friendly for vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions. What could they do better? Perhaps the staff can add more character to the dishes by giving a 5 second overlay to the already well prepared and presented dishes. The chef is from Italy and could also do a few rounds talking to the guests which tends to add warmth to the whole ambience. Bravo pizza Fabbrica team

we came on the recommendation of a friend and because we like the neighborhood. it was a pleasure to have a relaxed sunday lunch here as the pizzas were excellent (superb dough and ingredients), the olive oil fragrant and the beers on tap delicious. We also had a wonderfully cooked tagliata (italian style steak) with great vegetables. the service was most pleasant and polite so we look forward to coming again soo

For me the best place to eat amazing Italian food in Singapore. The staff is very welcoming and know how to treat customers. The pizza, pasta, slad and even the beers are delicious. I definately recommend it to everyone for lunch time and even for a dinner with friends. Good job guys, I will come back very soo

The food is great. This was my 2nd time in 2 weeks, and I tried the pizza this time. It was delicious and fresh. I really like the food here and also the vibe. Nice, modern decor.

THE place in Singapore for the best Italian food, beer and service..
Really impressed with the knowledge and effort taken to bring such delicious food to the table.

The best Italian restauranti in Singapore.
The pizza and pasta is fantastic.
The meet is over the top, and the dessert is wonderful.
I'm Italian, and if an Italian says that the food is excellent, it means that it is really.
Try.

We travelled to Singapore from Australia in March for our honeymoon and came across this Italian restaurant by chance. We were warmly greeted at the entrance and decided to give the place a try. We had Bruschetta, Pizza, wine and beer and were very satisfied with the meal. Over conversation with the waiter we discussed our love of pairing meals with beer and were recommended a menu for the next night. We booked a table and returned the following night and were extremely impressed once again. We enjoyed 3 courses, each of which came with a different Italian beer that suited the course brilliantly! Overall the experience was a memorable one and we will be recommending Pizza Fabbrica to anyone we know travelling to Singapore

Went to Fabbrica after hearing about it from a friend and had an enjoyable and memorable night with family and friends. We went with our kids and friends from Sweden who also loved the whole experience. The service was warm and friendly, the food was amazing and the whole ambience was hip and cool. The staff and chef were quick to cook up cheesy pasta for the kids which was not on their menu. Overall, I feel it has been the best Italian restaurant I have been to in Singapore

We read good reviews on the place but were absolutely bummed when both food & service turned out to be thoroughly disappointing. Service wise - staff felt cold & insincere & it was tough to get their attention. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only time we got a smile from a staff member was when we were leaving the restaurant after our meal.... :( A lot of waiting time went into getting the menu, finding someone to take our orders & getting the bill. Food wise - we ordered the gnocchi, a red & white pizza, & the squid ink pasta. Gnocchi was overcooked - very mushy & all you could really taste was the tomato sauce... pity! Pizzas - they were average, couple of my friends felt the crust was too thick and that there was more crust than toppings. When we were done with our gnocchi & pizzas, we had to wait between 10 to 15 minutes before the squid ink pasta finally arrived (seemed they forgot about it). Tasted pretty bland. Overall, we had a disappointing experience at Pizza Fabbrica and I don't think we'll be back again. It could have been a tiring / difficult night for the staff.. but it's always nice to service with a smile. :)

After wandering the streets of Arab section for months, I passed this place almost every day and never looked in. After reading the review on this website, I searched it out only to find Olivia's Italian. Good thing because the restaurant is closed on Mondays. This place has excellent food, service in the typical old Singapore district atmosphere. The restaurant is small but clean, wonderful smells and great food. The waiters are attentive and always chatty when I dine solo. Highly recommend it.

Went there because of excellent reviews but found food to be average and not really exceptional. Pizza was not warm when served after too long waiting and also a bit hard to chew. We didn't try other options in the menu but definitely not coming back for the pizzas next time.

Visited for dinner on a Friday evening with 4 friends. We ordered three pizzas and two pastas between us. Food was decent but what was annoying was the service. Only half the table received bread (they place the bread directly on your plate), our food took about an hour to arrive, and even then the pizzas made it to the table about 15 minutes before the pastas. As we were waiting for everyone's mains to arrive before digging in, our pizzas became cold and the bases turned soggy. It was a shame as the food was pretty good and there were a couple of other things on the menu that looked appealing enough for a return visit, but overall the service did affect the quality of our evening

There are no complaints to be found with this restaurant. All the pros listed below:1) Best beer available - artisanal beer from Italy. I tried the Oppal and Negro I believe and they were super2) Best Pizza - Pizza Fabbrica and Pizza with mushroom and truffle - its a no brainer!3) Best Gnocchi - I would have never known that gnocchi could be so darn good. It is apparently made in-house!4) Best risotto - fun fact which the founder, Sumit told us that the rice never gets overcooked even if you leave it on the stove for over half an hour unlike other risotto rice.5) Chilli jam found on the cheese platter - UNBELIEVABLY good with the cheese 6) Service - A+It was amazing to learn about the food/beer from the staff as they introduced each item that had been ordered and told us how it was made and consumed.8) They have "Proper Job" on tap which is what I had before I started with the artisanal beers from Italy.All in all, a place to not be missed if in Singapore

I finally tried this place today after hearing about it from my friends. What amazing stuff! One of the best pizzas I've had anywhere! The dessert was amazing - even the gelatos (which they make in-house too - these guys are crazy! and I tried two chocolate variants including one with hazelnut - brilliant). The gnocchi was unbelievable - darned well made, not dough-y and sticky, as is so often the case in other restaurants.  Had a pasta too - was very good - and yes they make the pasts in-house!  The taste of the rice in the risotto (the chef helpfully skipped the truffle in my mushroom risotto as some of my lunch-mates didn't want truffle) was eye-opening. And no - they don't grow their own rice too - I checked. It was heartwarming to see that there is a consciousness (and focus) for vegetarian options too - something which I find is frustratingly rare in Singapore. Heck - the people who had the coffee (I usually don't drink that stuff - I had beer ;) said it was awesome. The service was attentive, without being intruding. The (person who I felt was one of the founders) was very polite and helpful, and knowledgeable. The captain could be a little more smiling - but I'll attribute that to probably his having had a one-off bad days. He was polite and attentive too though. The décor is chic and minimalistic - gives a comfortable feel and makes one settle down easily. The music choice (for as long as I was there) was easygoing and pleasant.  And the range of craft Italian beers are to be seen to be believed (who'd have thought the same country which makes Nastro can actually make some real beers!?)  I had a very hoppy Italian one made by Baladin label called Super Bitter. It was not super bitter. Similar to very well-brewed Belgian ales.. Am definitely going back for sampling the rest of the pizzas AND the beers. They also Hitachino Nest Japanese white ale by Kiuchi Brewery on tap, along with the hoppy British beer Proper Job! I didn't expect this Italian restaurant to most likely become one of my beer destinations.

We came here because there's a 1-for-1 offer on The Entertainer app (we are scouring through all of them and checking the places one by one). The service was attentive, the restaurant not crowded at all on a Friday evening, the prices are fair for a typical mid-range Italian restaurant in Singapore but if you are expecting Italian quality you might find this place expensive. Around the same level as Spizza and Marche Movenpick's pizza but they have their own personality in terms of toppings and the crust. If you want the authentic Italian woodfired thin-crust pizza, you might be a tad disappointed; the wood-fired taste is not quite there, and somehow the toppings especially the cheese lacks oomph. That said, the beer selection is good - they have Hitachino White Nest beer on tap which is cool, to say the least. And the diehard Italian fans have their Peroni on tap as well. They could change the music playlist though - listening Katy Perry while eating pizzas is kind of jarring for me.Location is not so good - even in busy Bussorah Street sandwiched between similar type restaurants, I'd feel like if I went all the way there I might as well eat Lebanese or Moroccan food. Overall a pleasant experience but nothing to die for..Verdict: Go, especially if you have the 1-for-1 app.

Ordered two pizzas for delivery using Fabbrica first time. Menu looked bit odd. Could not find the usual chicken option and then realized this restuarant was the real deal Italian. Ordered two pizzas. One with mushroom+olives and the other had mushrooms+artichokes. I asked for chili to be added and I learn next time I must say little chili please. They put lots of fresh chopped chilli padi. Wow it was spicy hot. But I still loved it. Cos the other flavors of the authentic Italian toppings were really good and fought the spiciness. The real deal Italian food. Woodfired pizzas are the best and at Fabbrica they do it very well. Also the pizzas arrived warm so in case you want to eat quick that was possible. The pizza is laid on a foil inside a box. As I'm writing this review I can still recall the flavors and then thinking about my next order. Well done Fabbrica.

It really is a fantastic place serving great food. If you get a chance, speak to Sumit, the guy who owns the place. He's passionate to a fault, and will tell you about his food like a mother describes her child. Especially awesome if you're a vegetarian because they have a separate vegetarian menu, not the usual 'it's a seafood pasta, but i'll make it without the seafood'. The pumpkin base pizza was great, the gnocchi was outstanding and I can't remember having a better panna cotta any place else. If you're in the area, please head to this place. Actually, even if you're not in the area, make the effort. It's worth it

When I first walked past this place I was drawn to the open kitchen and really nice looking copper clad pizza oven...so we had to dine there :) I had initially thought it would be more of a pizza joint but it isn't really just that. It is ran authentic Italian restaurant with various pizzas, pastas and main options. The staff were very friendly...they served us sparkling water on the house (yes on the house) and home-made sundried tomato foccacias while we looked at the menu...We started off with their Burratina..which had a very decent portion and their cherry tomatoes are out of this world...and also their parma mango salad which was truly different from the usual parma melon salad. For mains we had their 4 cheese pizza...(not overbearing and just the right amount of cheese with a lovely oven charred base) and my favourite the Pancetta pizza which I'll describe as just yummy yummy yummy! We also had their lamb ragout pasta with chocolate...super yummy and their squid ink pasta with calamri and avocado (which doesnt make your teeth go black...I was informed that the pasta itself is made from squid ink) And to top it all was an exquisite saffron panna cotta and chocolate cake. They have over 20 craft beers and the wine by the glass selection was amazingly priced!! The whole experience was great...the staff were really friendly...they were very attentive to us...especially my 2 year old daughter.The food and drinks were great...and the whole seating and dining atmosphere gave a very relaxed and chilled out atmosphere with an openness right from the kitchen to the outside

It was certainly a pleasure dining at Fabbrica. The attraction of wood fired pizza was just not to be missed for anyone who wished to have authentic Italian pizza. Not only was the menu and food delightful both visually and on the palate, the service was also fantastic to say the least. The staff were friendly and helpful with a very reasonable pricing to go with all that. A must-go for anyone who wants to enjoy great Italian cuisine or just a great dining or drinks with your friends and family

The food and service are excellent, the prices are very reasonable by Singapore standards and the decor of the restaurant is very well done.This restaurant hasn't been open long but I have been here three times now and enjoyed every visit. The staff are friendly and helpful. The menu is not too complicated (starters, pastas, pizza) and all the food I've tried has been excellent. They have a really good craft beer menu and are happy to advise if you are not sure what beer to order

We've been looking for an authentic Italian restaurant in Singapore for a while and FINALLY, we've found a great place in the heart of Arab street. In the midst of the shisha bars and turkish restaurants in Arab street we found a hip, classy and casual Italian restaurant serving the perfect wood fired pizza's and delicious pasta. We visited the restaurant, a few times with family and friends, and have always had a great experience. We have tried the Burratina Rucola, Spaghetti Carbonara, Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, Gnocchi Pomodorini, Diavoli Pizza and Prosciutta Crudo Con Rucola. We paired these dishes with a chilled glass of the Hitachino Beer on tap and glasses of Brovia wine. Ask the staff for the pairing recommendations. End your meal on a high note with some amazing desserts. Our favourites are the Panna Cotta and the Crème Brûlée with coffee. We highly recommend this new Italian restaurant for all the Italian food lovers and for those who just want to have a great meal

I recently ate at Pizza Fabbrica with my work colleagues. If you are looking for a casual dining experience around Arab Street with great tasting food, good ambience and friendly staff, this place is a must visit. The food was very well presented and cooked perfectly. The staff did mention to us that they served their pastas Al Dente and that is exactly how it came out. The pizzas are all wood fired with generous fillings and they have a good selection of desserts too. Some pictures attached for you to see and drool :)))

Nice and friendly restaurant in the Arab quarter of Singapore. We found it in the midst of an awful rain just some half hour before closing, but all of the staff were nice and helpful, explaining mains are no longer available, but we are free to chose from pizzas and entrees. So we did, along with some beer from their good selection. Food arrived fast, overall a positive experience
