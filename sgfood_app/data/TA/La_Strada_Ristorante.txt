Celebrated my husband's birthday at this restaurant. I must say, this is one of the best Italian food I ever had! Great Burrata, great Gnocchi, their pasta was good. All 5 of us in the family enjoyed the food very much! I guess the only concern is the noise - it is a rather small restaurant so the acoustic is a bit of issue - we could hardly hear each other talk across the table! May be it was a crowded night and may be it is just a typical Italian restaurant which is supposedly to be loud and noisy? Whatever it is, you want great Italian food and willing to pay a bit more for good quality food, that's where you should go! Definitely will go again - once a while since it is quite expensive. Great location though - easy access! My husband was happy! :

Small cosy (noisy and crowded when full!) Italian restaurant with an amazingly good value 3-course set lunch even on weekends at $35/-!There’s a wide selection of appetisers and main courses. The servings are generous and the same as if it were ordered from the ala carte menu. We loved the carpaccio, vegetable soup with garlic bread, burrata for appetisers and the linguine alio olio, lobster pasta and risotto. The crab meat pasta from the ala carte menu was pretty good too.The limoncello tiramisu was a lovely and unique end to an excellent meal.Service was prompt and responsive despite the full restaurant. Would highly recommend reservations

My wife and I enjoyed coming to La Strada for the Italian fix from time to time. It continues to produce consistent and delicious Italian dishes over the years. It's reliable.Atmosphere was relaxing and service was friendly. Wines were appropriate. We also liked their specials written on the blackboard.It's a place for Italian comfort food

La Strada at Shaw Centre– along the street called Claymore Hill; hence named The Street I reckon - is a restaurant in Singapore I would recommend for a full Italian meal. It is not a very big restaurant but rather a cosy trattoria and yet the food speaks volumes.It is more than pasta and pizzas (actually I don’t think they even serve pizzas). Their carbonara is authentically made with eggs confit and not thickened with cream. I saw other interesting pastas with lobster, octopus and even truffles being served to other tables. I have been yearning for an escalope and so tried their turkey scaloppini (cant remember what they call it in the menu). It was nicely flattened, tenderized, breaded and optimally fried without tasting too oily nor dry. It comes with a Pomodoro sauce on the side and well complemented with Brussel sprouts, slightly charred on the edges.Eating this reminds me of a full sit-down dinner during my first visit to Italy years ago: a refreshing salad, then a plain (sans meat) but hearty pasta and then a simple piece of meat followed by dolce. Of course, with lots of vino and family and friends on a long table.What is of very good value at La Strada is their set lunches at S$35 for three courses with coffee and tea thrown in. If I’m not wrong, most of the menu items are offered as part of the set lunch with some variations such as additional charges for the expensive items. I say good value too because the portions are not down-sized as with other’s set meals. One should also check out their daily specials on the board.Service is consistently good as with their other Les Amis group of restaurants. I like it when the waiters know their food and are attentive. The first impression is also good when they don’t merely offer water as sparkling or still but rather iced or warm water too

Went there to celebrate friend's birthday. Food was above average with a good selection of appetizer, pasta, mains and drinks. We had the grilled octopus for sharing. She ordered the veal and I had the lobster pasta in pomodoro sauce. What was outstanding was the service. The wait staff were very friendly. They topped up the water the entire evening without being asked to. Prior to my friend's arrival, I enquired if they could help to prepare a slice of cake or dessert and the friendly manager recommended two different varieties of tiramisu and asked for her name. We had the tiramisu with her name spelled correctly next to it. When I asked for the bill, I realised the tiramisu was not reflected on it. The wait staff explained it was on the house! What a delight! Thank you very much La Strada! The restaurant was packed, so do remember to make a reservation before going

A friend recommended me this place. She had delicious scallops, carbonara and tiramisu dessert here recently. So another friend and I decided to go there to celebrate her birthday during lunch time. When I arrived there I was abit surprised at the oldish small place. Let's call it, rustic. I wasn't quite pleased with the seating arrangement as it's facing the kitchen and all types of flavors were emitting from it. Maybe they should have a door / curtain to block that and better aesthetics. The set lunch menu supposedly is $35++ per pax but if you select certain items, it's an extra cost of $3 or $4. Which I felt it's unnecessary to charge an extra fee for these so-called premium selections. Set lunch for two. We ordered Beef carpaccio (+$3), scallops appetizers (+$4). Saltimbanco veal (+$4?), carbonara as mains. Chocolate salami, lemon tiramisu (+$4?) & coffee/tea dessert. I can't really remember the extra fee for certain items but total bill for 2 with taxes was almost $95. No exactly cheap or value for money. We ordered different items to share for taste since it was our first time there. I enjoyed the appetizers. The scallops were tasty and juicy. Very nicely done, with crispy garlic and mushrooms + I think cauliflower purée. The beef carpaccio was yummy too. Fresh arugula leaves, creamy salad sauce and Parmesan shavings on top of thinly sliced raw beef. Nicely done. The mains disappointed though. The carbonara was tasty but not WOW. Maybe I expected too much. The portion was not much. My friend's veal, she was quite disappointed with it. It was a "naked" thin piece of meat on a plate with a bowl of salad on the side. The meat was quite tough and hard to cut. I thought the taste was ok but kinda tough. I thought maybe a couple of roasted potatoes on the side would have even better. The desserts were ok. The chocolate salami was rather nice. Like a chocolate truffle with nuts. The lemon tiramisu was abit of a disappointment. It wasn't bad. But just like a bowl of soaked sponge cake with cream topped over. Nothing impressive. Would I be back? Nothing really wowed me. I'm not sure if I would go back anytime soon. Not a bad meal but I'm sure I can get something superb for $100/ 2 Pax.

We come to this outlet regularly where the food is consistently good. The set lunches are very good value. As regulars; & not to be bored with their menu, they have seasonal specials as with my luncheon today. Starters: Seaweed pasta with caviar & uni. For mains: a crispy duck leg, followed by a Black Forrest tart by Janice Koh which is adjacent to La Strada. But be warned, the seasonal dishes are not cheap. You need to consider these items as a treat !Alan LeongSingapore

It was meant to be a dinner for 4 but it became a solo dinner when the other 3 friends couldn't meet because of unforeseen circumstances. I took the brave step to proceed with dinner alone because I've read good reviews of this restaurant. It was a fulfilling one for my palate and tummy. I can't give the Italian names of the items I ordered. In simple words, the breadsticks as starter was a treat (I bought some home for my kids as after dinner snack), clear soul with vegetables and clumps of melted cheese (comfort food) and the main which was a seared sole fish (I had mine deboned) with pine nut pesto. See my photos.The only regret was not having company to share any desserts.I will be back again for more

This restaurant is the best you will find in and around Pitesti. Large extensive menu great large servings of healthy food. Also large extensive news and wine menu. There salad are full of fresh fruit and veggies and their spaghetti bolognaise ia to die for. Try their lemon drink. Freshly squeezed lemon with honey and mineral water. Look doe the sign in the street and there is parking out the back. Lovely outdoor deck that has a lovely beeeze
4
Made reservations for a lunch at La Strada, specifically asking for a quiet table to celebrate friend's birthday. Restaurant confirmed my booking too. We ordered mussels and salmon for starters, gnoochi and beef for mains and the desserts were all good. The two servers were prompt and good (they worked hard). They even remember to add a little candle on my friend's dessert for good cheer even thou' I didnt ask for it. Hope the management will pass along my appreciation to both the servers and kitchen staff 
4
They usually have branzino, and the rest of the usual Italian food is good too, one of six places right next to each other all owned by same people, all very solid and good.
4
Fantastic dinner & excellent service. Both of us started with the seasonal special of white asparagus, prosciutto and poached egg, followed by the T-bone steak...beautifully prepared. Plus truffle mash, greens. And a bottle of 2007 Teroldego. Looking forward to going back!!
5
Great little place with warm friendly service and very nice food. Burrata and ham was delicious and fresh, and the Ravioli and the Carbonara were equally good. Fresh ingredients well prepared in a lovely ambiance... I'd highly recommend the place.
3
it is a small restaurant off Orchard Rd. the place is nice, service is good. The food was little disappointed. It wasn't bad but neither too good. I just had a pasta, and there are better place around there were to eat.

Read quite a bit of good reviews on La Strada. Decided to have lunch.Positive :Staffs are extremely friendly and service orientated. They did a pretty ok job on service recovery. Negative Ordered the set menu. May be that's the mistake I made. The price at $35 for Soup, main ,dessert and Coffee was a steal for this place ..Alas the food was very disappointing . When u get each course within the next few minutes you know it's not well prepared. Or it's readily available. The tuscan chickpea and kale soup was different. Felt it was diluted. First time left a soup not finished.Then came the clams and spicy sausage linguine.. It as just aweful. There was no flavour and the clams had not been cleaned well as I was biting into alot of sand. .Looked like the sand was not purged well. I practically left it untouched. The dessert Limoncello tiramisu. Was a wrong choice for me . Very sweet and little of the tiramisu. My bad on the choice. OverallNot sure if I had gone for ala carte the food might have been different. But a pricer choice.Might give it another go on ala carte..and hoping it will be better. Not the experience was hoping for
4
Good value 3 course lunch that we could choose from the menu. My hot appetizer was mussel with light tomato sauce, so succelent. Main was braised lamb shank, tender and tasty sauce. Finished with cheese platter. My son chose braised sausage and lentils then spaghetti carbonara and finished with chocolate cake. Friendly staffs and efficient services
4
La strada. Nice little italian resto by famous les amis grp Singapore. We tried their set lunch menu. Everything were very good. From appetizer to desserts. Prices was ok. We spent sgd 200 for 3 people with @ 1 drinkTheir tiramisu was greatWill come back agai

Went to try this place out after reading positive reviews about the food here, including a couple of reviews stating that this restaurant offers the best carbonara in Singapore. Sadly, that probably set us up for disappointment. We were there for the lauded set lunch. The service is the best part about this place â€“ attentive but unobtrusive, among the best in the business. The ambience is very traditional, giving a distinctly Italian home feel, which would be reflected in the food we ended up eating. The appetizers were really good, and turned out to be the best part of the meal. The shellfish were all incredibly fresh and plump, and a great deal as part of the set lunch, although we would've preferred the clams to be in a clear white wine, rather than marinara, sauce. The mains were generally let down by a lack of imagination. The lauded carbonara turned out to be underseasoned and did not tickle our tastebuds, despite its fresh ingredients. The side salad accompanying the veal scallopino, while generously portioned and featuring fresh greens, tasted heavy and uninspired, owing to the balsamic dressing. A zestier, lighter dressing would have helped to alleviate the heaviness of the meat dish. Desserts-wise, the lauded limoncello tiramisu ended up on our table looking like an indistinct dollop thrown onto a bowl, tasted pretty much the same, while the panna cotta was alright, with a generous sprinkling of walnuts.The freshness and quality of the seafood and produce, as well as the warm service, would probably be the biggest draw if we were ever in need of a place to eat in the area again, but it's hard to imagine this place drawing in new diners without much creativity evident in the dishes
5
Came in here last night without reservations. Place was almost full at dinner time, thankfully we still were able to get a table. We shared a starter salad, and tried the carbonara and crab pasta, and white wine. The pastas were delicious, and the service was friendly and prompt. Would come back again
5
Had a wonderful lunch get together at this venue. The place was small but the service and food was good. The set lunch was an absolute winner. We had 3 courses with well portioned entree, main, dessert and coffee or tea at $35++ each. The steak at an additional $10++ was unexpectedly large, lightly salted and chargrilled to medium. Beef carpaccio was generous but with overly creamy dressing. Mussels swimming in a rich tomato-based sauce were plentiful but generally small. Clam were succulent without being overcooked and tossed with al dente linguine. Braised lamb shank was off-the-bone tender but lacked the meaty flavor. Panna Cotta was light and milky without being too sweet. Cheese plate was quality accompanied by honeycomb.An excellent venue for Italian lunch without breaking the bank.
5
Visited this restaurant a few times and it didn't fail to impress. Good selection of wines and the carbonara is definitely the best in town!
4
Good Italian place - very flavorful and fresh - the burnt butter sauce was especially nice. They were very accommodating with us being vegetarian and made us whichever pasta we wanted. Definitely worth a visit if on orchard street.
3
Go for set as its cheaper. Steak is standard, salad is good, spaghetti aglio olio is well cooked. Water is free.
4
Very reliable and traditional Italian restaurant. Can't fault food or service, but it lacks any special or unique flair to earn 5 stars.
4
Cosy place. Went there to celebrate a 9 year old birthday. Service was efficient and pleasant. Portions were decent. Had the pulpo and jamon to start. Good size portions. Mains were risotto (both options) and the t-bone steak. Only feedback was a tad under-seasoned. Sampled the barolo by the glass - exp. Too full for dessert. Good ambience, food and service but not great.
5
Was there to celebrate 2 of my friends birthday..1st for all of us..staffs was attentive right from the start recommended us some dishes to share and it was superb!!!..love the fact that the staffs are cheerful n always helpful makes the small restaurant like it's a family gathering and to top if off they even gave slices of birthday cakes to my 2 dear friends!!..a definite must go if u want to entertain people...love love!!!.. will definitely be back!!
5
As part of the les amis group, is expecting something awesome from la strada. Well, wasn't disappointed at all. Nice little place with my favorite spot by the semi circular topped windows, I love digging into the carbonara pasta and burrata salad. And ending off with the tiramisu. Flavors here are authentic, well can b on the strong end as well but perfectly suited for my palate. I loved that every flavour is accentuated to excite the senses and revigorate the palate however dull it was prior to savouring the food here. TOP it off with a nice bottle of red. Service is better if u ask and be nice to the staff here. Not the most exciting Italian crew but certainly proud of the food served.
4
We came across this ristorante quite by chance. It benefits by being off Orchard Road. Judging by the customers in it it is a very popular lunchtime venue. We just wanted something very quick as we were time limited. I chose Spinach ravioli and my husband had some gnocchi. We followed this with the traditional tiramisu. All the food was well presented and the service was excellent. We will definitely go there again next time we are in Singapore
4
We had carbonara, crabmeat pasta, Sauvignon Blanc and honey tart dessert, all good, one of the best Italian places I have ever eaten here in Singapore. Authentic Italian decor ambience.Be prepared to pay more at this place, total bill came up to $173 for 3 pax plus 1 glass of wine only. food is good but small portions. Service is fantastic, maybe it's because we were the only customers there
4
We had fabulous food at this restaurant. The gnocchi with beef and pork ragu was amazing as was the meatball special. We had thoroughly enjoyed our evening until we asked for our bill. On receipt of the bill we noticed that we had only been charged for a glass of wine rather than a bottle. Because we are honest we informed the wait staff of this error. Unfortunately, rather than being grateful for advising of the error, it seemed like a huge inconvenience to the staff. No "thanks for being honest" only annoyance at having to rectify the bill. I wouldn't do so again at this restaurant- it seems it wasn't appreciated that we were honest. Shame, we have just moved to Singapore and thought we'd found a great new Italian eatery. Disappointing that the fabulous food is backed up by such poor service
5
The staff were very efficient and pleasant. The level of service here is excellent. The food is delicious though the portion may be small for some. Will definitely recommend to friends.
5
had a nice evening with friends , Good and attentive service despite been full house nice selection of white meat. but the Seabass would have been better off it its fillet
4
we had carbonara (one of the best around), gnocchi and tiramisu. they were all delicious but the portion for gnocchi can be bigger. we had to order truffle fries to feel more filled. Good dining experience overall.
4
Birthday dinner with my Girlfriend. The carbonara was delicious and so was the squid ink risotto. Only downside was that the soufflé was slightly undercooked if not it would be perfect. Can have promotions during dinner too.
5
Excellent value for money, enhanced by amazing tasting food and good service. We had the set lunch here recently. Appetizers were scallops done just right and a cesare salad with yummy dressing. For mains we had the ravioli with sage butter and carbonara. Both pastas were delicious. Dessert was a true treat - lemon tiramisu and cassatta. Will definitely go here again.
5
Was taken into this place by a friend for a business lunch. The restaurant is nice and cosy in a side street from the Orchard Buzz..The food was superb but the service was even more impressive great Sommelier able to find you fantastic wine at very competitive price  My Pick A buratta with Parma ham and tomatos (with nice flavour) the Ravioli Ricotta and Spinach as a desert the Limoncello Tiramisu
5
We had dinner here on Monday night after reading the reviews. My wife enjoyed her carbonara. I had the roast australian pork chop which was superb, tender, tasty and moist. We shared an excellent traditional tiramisu. The prices were reasonable and the service was faultless. We had trouble finding the restaurant via the Shaw Centre. The easy access is from Claymore Hill, off Scotts Road
4
Happened to pass by that area, was attracted by their decoration. Went in to ask if they have table for 2, the gentleman was very kind to check and got me 1 table.Cosy little hut, filled with customers and of course we have to wait about 15min for the food to be served.Ordered a seabass and one risotto.Will certainly come back again. Heard the Carbonara is very good
4
The service is immaculate. Hardly have to wait before the food I ordered arrived on my table. The pasta was excellent. Then I had the tiramisu. And not before long, presto, it came. The tiramisu was out of this world. This Italian place off Scotts road is a great find
5
This restaurant was very good. Not a very big restaurant but I like the atmosphere there. Nice and quite. If you visit Singapore, I highly recommended you to eat there. The food was high quality and the service was excellent. We ordered several dishes, like pizza, ox tail, sea basket, salad and spaghetti. We ordered a bottle of white wine which made the dinner even better. Well, the bill was not cheap but it worth to try this restaurant. We also got free desserts to take back to the hotel
4
Great food. Very affordable and the ambience is really cosy! Service staff was kind to provide the extra mile by offering us a free dessert. It's my second trip in less than a month and happy to be back soon again.
5
A very popular restaurant on Scotts Road. Always busy but the wait is totally worthy because the foods is too good.
4
I went there with my husband.. The ambiance was very cozy & you definitely feel Italian.. both husband and I were indecisive of what to eat. The staff were kind enough to suggest us on what's good on the menu... thank you to one of their very accommodating staff named Raju, we enjoyed every dished served. The clamps were tasty, their pasta were fresh and original and the lamb was cooked in the right texture as told. You guys should definitely try their carbonara. The homemade pistachio ice cream was just yum.. Will definitely come back to try their other menus as well
4
This was a nice surprise, good Italian food, and with almost authentic Italian atmosphere. Had a good Prime Beef that tasted great, and the accompanying Mushrooms and sauce was extremely good. (The beef had a bit too much fat). The green salad had also a great and tasteful dressing, great! The prices a bit high, but maybe the biggest disappointment was that they put up the "CLOSED" sign at 10:00 pm.
5
As a Les Amis group member, La Strada met our expectations of a gourmet Italian cuisine. Ambience is nice & cosy, well presented menu with good choices. Service was professional & friendly. Food was delicious , good portion for sharing complemented by a value wine selection. Had burata salad, seafood pasta & bisteca steak. Looking forward to visit again with more friends 
5
Use to come here quite often because they had the best carbonara in town. But they renovated and things changed so we stopped coming. So glad I came back. Service was excellent and restaurant manager tries to greet old customers. Had the wagyu beef special which was a bit too fatty for me - but sure other people would have loved it. Oso Bucco was amazing and done the real Italian way with risotto inside. Carbonara was also excellent but more buttery too. And one has to finish off with the soufflé. Half chocolate and half matcha and very big. Only issue was kept smelling food off the exhaust. Want to come here again
4
We were walking by and we're happy to get a table without a reservation on a Saturday evening. The ambience is cosy and the wait staff knowledgable. The starters were definitely the highlight of the meal, we had beautiful scallops, a diving carpaccio and wholesome smoked fish. both the crab pasta and lamb risotto were nice but nothing spectacular. The desserts we wanted were not available. The chocolate salami was nice but maybe I had built it up too much in my head, the tiramisu was definitely a hit.
4
We decided to try La Strada to celebrate my new job and we were not disappointed.The restaurant is cozy and homy with a touch of class. Service is perfect and food tastes authentic (we're both Italian, so you can trust us!) although - like everything in Singapore - it is a bit pricey.We ordered burrata, ravioli and saltimbocca, with a truffle popsicle as a dessert. A fantastic Dolcetto d'Alba accompanied our dinner.As a pleasant gift we received a bag with two tarts on our way out, definitely an excellent way to say goodbye to the guests
5
Good food with a decent set lunch price. S$35++ for 3-course lunch is good value at this place. We've tried the chicken, beef and seafood mains. Very comforting meals and good service. Notable dishes include capesante for starter, pollo and ciopinno for mains. Desserts come in small portions, so you will be sure you have sufficient 'space' for dessert. Pistachio ice cream and the tiramisu are both good options. You should call to reserve for four people and above as there are limited seats at the restaurant
3
It's like a shake-up has gone through the Les Amis group: all of its 'weak' outlets have improved tremendously in the last 12 months. La Strada still does not rank among the top half of Italian restaurants in Singapore - it is more a 'trattoria' than a fine-dining 'ristorante'- but overall the food is pretty good, even if dishes are quite simple, not benefiting from the best ingredients, or executed with excellence. Example: the carbonara is decent, but with too much milk, looking soupy like a laksa (!!), whereas the unctuous texture of a top carbonara would come from a combo of cream, egg yolk, and various cheeses. The service team is friendly and efficient. The set lunch is good value; the à la carte is not, given the quality
4
Literally per my review. I'm not sure if I would pay almost 30 dollars for a handful of carbonara noodles, which were admittedly amazing but so very expensive. It's a nice treat but there are cheaper Italian eats elsewhere.
5
I keep coming here for lunch. The lunch set is just great. I like the lamb stew and the mussels were great. It's really good value for lunch and the place is very rustic in decor. Fantastic.
4
Small and cosy restaurant. Good tasty food but a bit pricey. Love the grilled octopus & truffle pasta. Had the truffle ice-cream but is $18 for a mini magnum sized ice-cream!
4
The restaurant is set up in the style of an authentic trattoria as you find them in Italy. The food is well prepared and there's a good selection of not too much overpriced Italian wines... Service is friendly and efficient.
5
This small Italian restaurant turned out to be a 'gem'.Not many table, many 16 . . .so a reservation is recommended.We arrived at 12:30 pm December 10th without a reservation, but fortunately they had a table for two. We selected the 'daily special', 3 cores meal fro $ 35 . . . you can change or upgrade for a nominal amount of money. The food and service were fabulous. Be sure to check out the funky toilet (1 'loo' for both sexes). The only negative thing is the tables are very close together, 'elbow to elbow' with your neighbour, so it's difficult to have a private conversation
3
This restaurant has fine dining concept(and of course, fine dining price), but the food is really unspectacular. From the appetizer to the main course to the dessert, none of the food are really 'fine' and is quite average. Cold platter, grilled rib eyes, normal tasting ice-creams, etc... Nothing really stands out for such pricey restaurant.
3
1. They called a few hours prior to confirm reservation, the moment I showed up, i was informed that I do NOT have a reservation. 2. bruschette: a salty, rel tasteless sloch of tomato pure. 3. A glass of Dolcetto for SGD 19, OK but not fantastic either4. Main course: where are the melanzane they promised on the menu? same tomato sauce as used for the bruschette?Would I come again: N
5
This little restaurant is right next Royal Plaza on Scotts...the road besides the Shaw Center. I bumped into this place by mere accident and I am so glad I did. The food is EXCELLENT, some of the best Italian food I have had in Singapore. Highly recommended based on personal choice are; the lamb pasta, the chicken, ham and cheese (the Italian version of a cordon blu) and the homemade ravioli. The place is small and seats approximately 20 people at a time...but the ambiance and decor is pure class. It almost takes you to the valley's of Tuscany. I highly recommend this venue to all those that love a quiet dinner. It is best to make a reservation as this place would undoubtedly get filled up fast.In terms of price, it is very reasonable for the quality of food and service. Well done teal La Strada.
4
Background- Small Italian restaurant under the Les Amis group. Located at Shaw Centre. Siblings include Les Amis (not great), Bistro Du Vin (great set lunches).Food- Carbonara was excellent. Thin, al dente, homemade guitar string pasta coupled with salty lardo crumble and truffle butter sauce. Tiramisu was average; sponge was a little too soggy.Pricing- Not cheap. Carbonara was $28++ for a rather small bowl whilst tiramisu was $18++
4
Had lunch here with friends. The restaurant is small and cosy. A nice little hideaway from the Orchard Road crowd. The set lunches offer pretty good value at S$35++ for 3 courses plus coffee. Unlike some restaurants that offer very limited choices, customers at La Strada can choose from a good selection of Appetisers, Mains and Desserts. My carbonara was one of the yummiest I've ever had with just the right amount of cream. A friend topped-up S$10 for the Bistecca (Australian ribeye). She wanted it done medium but when it arrived we both felt it was still pretty rare in the middle. Even though we decided to let it pass, the service staff noticed the small commotion at our table, took the initiative and offered to have the steak redone. 'A' for good service! We'll be back to try the other items on the menu
3
Good italian restaurant near orchard road mail malls. Had a fish pasta That was Nice but could do with more spices and flavour.
4
We ate very well and the service was very professional and caring. The place was a bit noisy as there was a few groups eating there. I recommend the carpaccio and the cod was superbly presented and so delicious.
5
Great variety of choices of authentic Italian food. Would visit again to try more of their food.The chef was friendly to be out sometimes to help the service staff and also recommend some food. Love the food, it is well seasoned, and my friends and family love the food. Staffs was friendly and recommend the wine we wanted. Small but yet cosy restauran
5
We chanced upon this restaurant and have revisited it several times. The quality of the dishes are exceptional, and most importantly, they are consistently good. Service is attentive and friendly, the small team of service staff led by the young manager are attentive without being intrusive, constantly refilling our water and providing wet serviettes when needed. The set lunch is value for money with good sized portion. We love the seafood dishes as much as the pasta (no, they don't serve pizza here), and highly recommend the sphagetti carbonara and lobster cioppino. The citrus tiramisu is also a must try
4
La Strada is reputable for its more than fine pasta dishes and Italian cuisine but what really stands out is its service. Throughout my dinner, the staff paid constant attention to my dietary requirement- lactose intolerant. When it came to the desert, the staff actually went out to a nearby Japanese supermarket to purchase some quality Japanese fruits,to replace the desert that had diary content that couldn't be separated. Really appreciate the service!!Being a Singaporean, I can say that there are not that many establishment that has such refined service. Highly recommended for its food and of course their service
5
We came there for lunch on a Friday! The tables were full, so the chef offered us a place in the restaurant next door named "Caveau" from the same company.There was a lunch menu with starters, main course (meat and fish), dessert and tea or coffee for 35 Singapourian dollars.Quick service, air-conditioning and nice atmosphere. The food was succulent
4
First time visited this restaurant. Never know about it till recently walked passed. Luckily get there before 7, otherwise difficult to get a table without reservation. Restaurant is small and filled up with guesses very fast. We didn't order the set menu but a la cart. Ravioli and tiramisu are really surprised us. Ravioli in rich cheese and creamy sauce with a glass of white wine is a good combination. Will visit again for their carbonar
3
After all the great reviews we read, we expected a great meal.I ordered the braised veal. It was fatty, and the sauce was overly salted. My wife ordered the roasted turbot, and it was quite average--not Italian-style at all.I recommend a pass on this restaurant. There are many better Italian restaurants in the neighborhood
5
My friend and I didn't have a reservation but we were very lucky to get a table on a Friday lunch time.The restaurant offers a set three course lunch for $35++ or there a la carte menu.My friend and and I choose the set lunch. The portion size was just perfect for us. The service was really good.I would come back again
4
We happened on La Strada while exploring restaurants on Scotts Road. The atmosphere fit the cuisine--a cozy European cafe. We both had a pasta dish with seafood which was quite good. The order of focaccia was especially nice. The staff were both friendly and efficient. This provides a nice break from Asian food, if you need one
3
Ambiance- cozy and comfy.
Service - attentive, friendly, courteous.
Food - warm and home cooked, steak melted in the mouth, cod was unpretentiousness
4
Had a good and satisfying meal here. Appetisers were well done, the crab pasta was delicious. Wagyu beef cheek was ok. Tiramisu needed help.
2
Following a well flavoured carpaccio, the four of us all chose a different pasta. Quite nice flavours for each. Carbonara presented well but over cooked pasta. Clam linguine nice with plenty of clams but a little too watery. Ravioli a bit heavy on the cream sauce. Pork taglitelli very nice just not enough of it. Reasonable bottle of wine. But all in all too over priced. $20+ for a small entree and $30+ for a small pasta. Couldn't even consider the $50+ for the meat options. And then the waiter decided to open a second bottle of $8 mineral water without even asking. Taking advantage of the location and taking advantage of customers too polite to say no I didn't ask for that.

Stayed near this restaurant and had dinner twice here. Among all of the menu offered, I recommend the Black Cod. It's perfectly cooked with the tasty sauce to complement the fish. We've ordered others such as steaks, the daily specials, et. all, but I seem to enjoy the seafoods better. Need improvements on the real Italians--service was great

Came here to try the set lunch at $35++ for a 3 course meal with tea or coffee included. I opted for the prosciutto starter and the ocean trout, with the dessert being standard. The wife chose the scallops and the pork, both of which were far better choices than mine. The ocean trout was mediocre at best. Overall the experience was decidedly average, not sure we will be coming back any time soon

Had lunch here on my own. A real Italian hill town trattoria feel to the place, families, children, young and old, locals and tourists; everyone enjoying their eating experience.The octopus in their insalata di polpo was succulently done to a turn, when it could so easily have been tough and the dressing on the salad was delicious.The chitarra alla carbonara was rich, creamy, intense, well-flavoured by the pancetta and, with just a wee touch of the truffle, it was ghostily scented.When visiting somewhere new, I like to eat in different restaurants, to get a feel of the variety, but I greatly regret my decision not to eat here the following evening.I'll be back

I am very often critical of Italian Restaurants in Singapore given my background..but the set lunch me and my wife had last week at La Strada was one if the best I have had in Singapore for a long time. $35 paid for a great starter with italian sausage and cheese followed by a steak with nice grilled vegetables and legumes and a nice dessert with ice cream and cake. Excellent service, attentive not smothering or aggressive in pushing you yo consume more as it is the practice in Singapore these days. Super advisable for set lunch

Dreadful, over-priced food in a ridiculously pretentious setting. Pasta primavera had no taste at all and even when tomato sauce was added was bland in the extreme. The veal dish was just a plate of meat and mushrooms swimming in a bland cream sauce. Ridiculously, there were no vegetables or other accompaniments to this dish, either included or available as side orders. Wine was expensive and very acidic. The waiting staff tried their best but nothing could make up for such shocking food.

I don't know why I'd never gone there but suspect it's because parking is tough in the building as the lots are super small. Anyway, the food. So it's something with a great deal of variety but enough but the quality of food is totally up there. It is the BEST burrata we have had in SG. ANd I had the Iberico pasta which I really liked. And we also had the lamb which was very very good.The place is cozy and the service staff are efficient and well informed and made you feel at home.Excellent all round

We wanted to try this restaurant since it's under Les Amis group. However, we regret to ever step into this restaurant. The price is above average but the taste is super horrible. We ordered baby squid as appetizer and it tasted fishy ($26). Wagyu carpaccio is nothing special ($28). All the 3 pastas we ordered was the worst we have ever eaten. Pappardelle with Iberico pork ($35), the pork tasted like Chinese roasted pork (chasiu). Handmade thin noodle carbonara ($28), the presentation really looked like instant Maggie noodle with few bit pieces of bacon and topped with half boiled egg, tasted horrible too. Vongole ($28) was nothing special. The only thing acceptable was the wine by the glass (@$18). Such a disgrace to Les Amis group, we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone
