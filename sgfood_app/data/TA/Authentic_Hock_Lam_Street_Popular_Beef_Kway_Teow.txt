Tasty beef noodles, whether dry or soup, and with good fast service with a smile. It is traditional, and they have been at it for years. Have followed them when they moved from different locations until the current one. Always enjoyed a trip there, at least once a month or more frequent if possible

Our own singapore classic beef noodles at its best. There are some changes to the taste of the soup and gravy but for the better. It comes in herbal soup now which I my opinion taste better.Price is on the higher side but I believe it's due to the high rental. They also offer angus beef set that comes with rice

I don't know which Hock Lam location is the 'original' or 'authentic' one, but the Teochew beef noodle soup served here is very good!The broth is delicious and there is a galore of yummy meat, especially if you go for the 'Supreme mix' and add extra stuff like tendon, tripes, beef balls, etc. In fact, with so much meat you'd wish they had served it with herbs and raw vegs, as the Vietnamese do with Phở. There is a Phở place in Saigon that does exactly that - 10 different kinds of meat with a mountain of herbs - paradise for noodle soup lovers
