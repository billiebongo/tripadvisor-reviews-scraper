Similar in standard to most tze char stalls all around Singapore. Good if you live around the neighbourhood. Only ate here as Ivin's was closed on Thursdays.

So happy that this simple little eating house is so close by. We can feed our family of five and have two large Tigers for 35 sing! Friendly staff and never ending supply of extra chilis. What more could you want?

This is one of my all time favorite local Chinese eating places. Simple local coffeeshop setting in the heart of Bukit Timah. The eatery is clean and airy. Love the curry fish head - the curry is rich and tasty with just the right degree of spiciness. Also ordered the "har jiong kai" which is the fried chicken wings in prawn paste sauce - crispy and savory. The oyster omelette is done well with a generous portion of oysters sans the starch which some stalls tend to mix in. Rounded out our meal with the Hokkien Noodles which was heavenly.

Great chicken noodles that our daughter loves. Pork buns that are too good to resist. Always busy with locals and expats living nearby. Shut on a Thursday night. Staff are friendly once you get chatting and will help with food selection. Don't be afraid to tell the uncles if you want less spice. Cheap too.

Heard many great reviews about the food. Decided to order seafood hor fun for take away. Was disappointed as there was no wok hei flavor and the hor fun was super soggy. Maybe it was because I take away instead of eating there but good food will still taste good even if you take away

My wife and I wandered around the roads at the back of Bukit Timah - apologies for the spelling - and stumbled across this eatery. We sat down at a roadside table and had two simple dishes. Chicken noodles and pork noodles. Beautiful taste and so simply cooked. Along with iced beer. Too hot for the non iced version........we will return

Food as usual very well done. Signature dishes includes their battered calamari, scrimp paste chicken wings, and sweet sour pork. Today it's done very well. Unfortunately the fried rice let it down 1 star. The fried Mee was very good and the oyster omelette was ok. Service is quick and impeccable.

Hup choon is our favorite haunt for group dining. They take reservations, which is necessary for big groups. Our favorite dish are omelette, fried chicken, calamari and fish head curry. The staff are friendly and happy. Parking is limited and do not park in front of the houses nearby, the fine is hefty.

I'm not a regular reviewer for restaurants in my home country, but I feel compelled to do so for Hup Choon as they are a real gem. They are situated in a posh neighbourhood so it's almost impossible to find a place that serves delicious local fare at very reasonable prices. Almost everything on their menu is worth trying. Do ask them for their daily special which isn't on the menu. Expect dinner crowds, especially on weekends. A lot of families in the area call them for take-aways instead of cooking dinner, adding to their popularity. Definitely worth a try if you're in the vicinity. They do take reservations, so do pls call ahead if you want a table waiting for you when you arrive. Plenty of locals and foreigners frequent this place, so you can't go wrong
