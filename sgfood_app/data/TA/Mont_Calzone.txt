Went there for drinks and finger food. We ordered pizza, different types of French fries, prawn paste chicken, Ngoh Hiang- Chinese spring roll. The white wine we ordered was Pierre Jean, reasonably priced and of course happy hours for beer- 1 for 1. The finger food , the spring roll and chicken wings were all every good, I recommend ordering. The indoor part is quite small so we sat outside in the open air. As it's quite warm and humid, I would advise that you wear something light. Ambience is quite nice outside

Nice cozy corner located at church street, good selection of pastas and pizzas. Went in a group of 4, we shared among ourselves sambal smoked duck pasta, chilli crab pasta, mushroom risotto and a pizza with a sunny side up on top (cant remember the name of the pizza). ! must say we are quite impress with the food. Drinks wise was average as we had our usual bottled beers so not special. Service was at times slow but i believe it was due to skeleton manpower.Overall will come back again for the pastas, hope to see more local/asian flavours

Had a awesome time spent there with my friends. They have very very yummy food like their pasta, pizzas and their finger food like fried calamari and etc, it was really good. I like their homemade mont milk tea , it's extremly tasty and their service is really good, friendly and knowledgable. Would love to come back here again, the ambience is romantic enough for couples and family as well:
