Tasty, satisfying food that leaves you feeling healthier after eating it. One of my favourite places for lunch in the cbd. Particularly amazing labne.
5
The most authentic middle eastern food. Purely vegetarian and so many options
Must try the platter they have
Cheers

It is a small place that mainly operates on weekdays - relying on the office crowd at lunchtime, but the food is simple yet delicious. Many of the dishes are vegan, I highly recommend the pita bread with hummus and falafels.
5
Excellent food. Great service. Reasonable price. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Singapore! Great selection/choice. We enjoyed the platter for 2. Would recommend.
5
We have bee loyal visitors of Fill a Pita since 3+ years...and not just the ambience and location has changed for the better, the quality of food has simply magnified multiple times! Be it the coriander hummus, garlic hummus, falafel, halloumi, fava beans or labna cheese, taboulleh salad or the pita bread itself. Simply amazing taste. Our favourite place for lunch and we visit at least once a week. Do not miss their recent offering Pisaara, a mouth watering Egyptian dish hand made by Mr. Mamdu (the owner’s) wife. A true delight and a must visit if you love Mediterranean or Egyptian cuisine!!! Great hospitality and excellent food makes this place a winner

I’ve been regularly going to Fill-A-Pita for over a year. It’s definitely my favourite place to go to for delicious and healthy Mediterranean food. Owned by an Egyptian man and a lovely Singaporean lady, the food is always prepared fresh with love. I usually grab the Falafel Pita and Hummus, and I haven’t found another place in SG that does it so well. It’s also vegetarian and vegan friendly. I’d recommend that people visit out of the office lunch time hours. Located on the cusp of the CBD, it gets quite crowded during lunch time (for good reason) and expect long wait times because the food is prepared fresh. It’s a small establishment so getting a table during lunchtime can be tough too. I’d recommend swinging by after 2pm for those who want a quiet lunch
3
Food is so so but just not sure it’s worth the wait. Nice people but service real slow. Don’t go out of your way to eat there. If waking by and hungry than sure try it

It seems like the quality of food has gone down from the last time I visited this place in Shenton Way. Macaroni used for Koshari is not fresh and with stale tomato sauce on top
1
Terrible owner! Everything else is nice but the whole experience of eating here was bad as the owner of this restaurant is rude. Usually there is a lady at the cash counter and she is nice. But if you see this old man who is the owner of this place, he is rude to his customers. They overcharge 1 dollar for credit card payments and if you ask them why politely, owner will simply shout or be rude to you instead of explaining politely. Never going to this place again

I love Mediterranean food and tried out fill-a-pita for lunch with family. The staff is very nice and courteous and we were attended to promptly.The food though was a hit and miss. The hummus was excellent, one of the best i have had. The multi-grain pita was warm, but it did not seem freshly made. We also had koshari rice/pasta/lentil bowl, eggplant pita sandwich and mushroom vegetables lasagna. Eggplant sandwich filling was very refreshing and good, however again a bit of letdown was the pre-made (or packaged) pita. Lasagna and the koshari were average, and i would have given them full points if only the sauce was made from fresh ingredients. While the rice , pasta , mushroom etc. seemed freshly cooked, the sauce originating from canned tomatoes was clear...and when i went back to get some serviettes i noticed the pomodoro tomato cans in the background. While pomodoro is a good choice for making red sauce, unfortunately it doesnt work so well from canned version. We also tried the chilled lemonade which being pre-made was also lacking the freshness and zest you feel from a freshly made lemonade.I think being a quick in-and-out style of food place and to keep the price affordable, they have to make some short-cuts like the canned tomatoes and pre-made pita etc. but that takes away from the food being excellent. Don't expect to be wowed, but a decent vegetarian Mediterranean option
5
Love the food.Healthy baked falafels with fresh whole meal pita bread. Dips are great too. Warm and friendly owner. Great option for vegetarians in the business district.
5
A friend recommended this place and it was well worth it! Delicious, home-made, fresh ingredients. Nice atmosphere and friendly owners. Vegetarian halal Middle Eastern cuisine. Recommend going on a Saturday afternoon for a chill environment.
4
Lovely ambience and great food. We had a platter which was good enough for 2 of us. Hibiscus drink is definitely recommend.
5
I have been regular customer of Fill A Pita for last couple of years. This is one of the top favourite place for me to have lunch. Food options here are quite healthy and staff is very friendly. I am grateful for their hospitality and special attention I get for my dietary needs.I keep bringing my friends and family here for happy meals
5
This was our second visit in 3 days, it did not disappoint. The babaganoush, hummus and labna cheese served with warm pitta were lovely. The owner insisted we try the house special fava beans too (complimentary). All in we had a tasty lunch for two for SG$14.
5
I visited this place for the first time and the food is pretty decent. There is good variety available to choose from so you can possibly do multiple visit to try everything in the menu. If you would like your food to be spicy please request for it as the standard serving is not spicy enough. Overall a good option and would visit one more time to see if there is consistency
3
This was was a super place to eat before - the old owner had good character and gave this place a buzz. Now it's become a regular commercial restaurant - average service and scrimping on fillings. I ordered a Falafel Pita with chili and yogurt - but had to ask for garlic yogurt twice as they only give you like 10ml at time. I remember the days when Hassan used to just come and give the bottle to use. Hummus also served without a spoon. They also removed the free water tank. Its a shame as it was a great place to eat...
5
I am a regular visitor and find the menu has an excellent selection of healthy lunch choices. The owners are very friendly and add to the great overall ambiance. I often have the mixed falafel and fava bean pita or the Koshari. I will continue to enjoy my lunch experiences at Fill a Pita
1
Disappointing salad portion. Their falafel taste very different to authentic middle eastern one and is not at all to my taste. Wouldn't go back.
5
Was there last Friday. The pita served was hot and fresh that you could eat it on its own. The falafel was just fabulous. As i was there during non-peak, I had a chance to speak with the owner, Mamdouh. He is an Egyptian and I could tell he is extremely passionate about his food and in delighting his customers. Try also the Tamarind drink..its refreshing and I doubt you can find it anywhere else. Definitely a place to go if you are looking for Mid East Vegetarian food
5
Such lovely service for the sweet lady at the counter. Would definitely come past again. Big bonus for me is that the menu indicates which items have no garlic and no onion - ideal if you need a fructose friendly option
5
This is the place for top quality food and first class services. Selling pita, salads koshari brown rice and lenthil soup. A must visit when you are around the area.
5
We had best falafel in Singapore at this place. It's organic and vegetarian. Walk on MBS before and after is unforgettable.
1
Was super excited to try this place out but genuinely disappointed by their falafel and Taboulleh salad. First, the falafel itself tastes nothing like original middle eastern falafel. Second, the Taboulleh portion for $4 was just ridiculous. It was a sauce size serving... Furthermore, I got sick from the food. I would not recommend this place at all.
5
The staff here is genuinely so kind and helpful. While I was eating my food and being my normal messy self, the woman working the cashier grabbed a handful of napkins and came over to give them to me with a smile. No worker has ever done something like that for me unprompted, it was very sweet of her. I had the fava bean pita, which was super delicious and tasted fresh. Service was very quick and you can sample the ingredients if you'd like, such as the fava beans. This restaurant has great vegan options and even labels which menu items are vegan
5
I have been told by my friends to give a visit to this place to taste their foodsSo i decide to choose a sample from everything started wirh the sidesHommus was excellent and Labnah then to Falafel was hot and fresh then ended up with their Koshari brown rice and their new drink Tamar Ind, i never taste it before It was fantastic.Really the food was fresh and healthy plus the hospitality was given to me was excellent I wish to thank the whole team for their services
5
I have been at this awesome place a few times for lunch and also brought my visitors as fresh pitas, soups & hummus are absolutely beautiful (haven't tried everything from the menu yet but will return for sure very soon to do so). Amazing, authentic taste, fresh and healthy ingredients, wonderful sauces and most importantly: It's made with love by a fantastic staff and attentive & passionate owner. Perfect for everyone who like it healthy, balanced, flavourful & oriental - real soul food!
1
If you come here for the falafel pita you have to 100% tell them no chili unless you want South-east Asian level of spiciness x 100. This place advertises itself as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, but ask yourself what Mediterranean or Middle Eastern pita has ever -DRENCHED- its pita with chili sauce. And I mean drenched. Look at their main picture at the top with a pita, it's red because it's ALL chili. Absolutely inedible unless you've got taste buds made of wood. And don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about it being "too spicy" for my tastes (I like spicy food!). I'm talking the pita was drenched in chili sauce to the point where the food is inedible
4
Food was affordable. Chilli sauce in the falafel pita was spicy, tangy and weird. Look for their specials on a board, which we missed. And an option of a pita pocket would be welcome. We could not finished the whole pita. It was messy to eat too with sauce leaking out. Lady at counter could explain and help us with choices
5
Called to check if we could reserve a table for 6 to celebrate a birthday on a busy Friday afternoon. When they heard it was a birthday, they gave us free drinks and cutlery for the cake. The food was fantastic and it was a lovely long lunch. Highly recommend the place.
5
In spite of I'm coming from Egypt whereby you can get best Koshary or Falafel but the food in FaP was tasty and the friendly atmosphere offered by staff was exceptional
It's not easy to get all of this with low cost under one roof.
5
Staff were very friendly and explained what the names of the dishes meant. The sharing platter does not look much but was a huge portion enough for three ladies.
5
Lovely atmosphere, delicious down-to-earth lovingly made falafels and dips, and good service! The serving size was bigger than I expected. Even on a Monday lunch time, the place was packed with diners. Make sure to visit their facebook page for operating hours and weekly specials.
5
I ordered the falafel pita with a side of hummus and it was delicious! Everything tasted fresh. For those looking for a quick bite with wholesome ingredients, visit this place.
5
It is the last day of my Singapore trip and I am so glad I found this place. 'Save the best for last'. The staff is so friendly! The lady behind the counter was so sweet and helpful. I could' really decide what to take because I saw so many nice things on the menu. She helped me pick a few things so that I could try a little bit of everything. There was no babaganoush today, but they did have a new dish with eggplant on the menu that I could try. I had pita, hummus, favabeans, falafel and that new eggplant dish. And homemade lemonade! Everything was really delicious! Loved the personal service. The owner (I think?) also came to my table to ask how I liked the food. I can't wait to be back in Singapore and visit this place again. I never had the urge to write a review on TripAdvisor, but for this restaurant I just had to!
5
Customer service was second to none. We had the falafel pitta and hoummus which was lovely and incredibly filling. The staff then came over and asked us if we needed directions to the next place we were going to which was a nice touch. Well worth a visit!
2
I have no idea what this place is rated so high. It's has overpriced tasteless food.I am not sure the cook even knows how to make falafel which is a staple in Mediterranean food
5
Greeted with very friendly warmth and attention by the owner and staff, served piping hot and really delicious pita and falafel, with all the trimmings you could possibly wish for, cheeses, sauces, and even extra, steaming hot pita when the owner saw we had gobbled everything up. Such love poured into cooking their very own food and serving it with joy is rare indeed. I am thoroughly impressed; the people and the food made my day, thank you so much
5
Went the extra mile of going back with cash, payWave isn't on yet. The owner hoped for my sake it was worth it & I can categorically say it was in all aspects of engaging service, quality fare, washed down with homemade lemonade. Don't miss this lunch experience when in the city
4
I went here a couple of times - the food was really nice (vegan options on the menu), however some options are not available on all days so be wary if you're going there for a specific dish. When I went one time there were no pita available (!)
4
The Kosher rice topped with crunchy fried onions and spicy tomato gravy is delicious! The baked falafel balls, fava beans pita is fresh and filling ! Hassan and his team are always keen to go the extra mile to make the customer happy !!
5
They kept the kitchen open for us because it was pouring down rain! Customer service at its best. Plus a great option for something fresh and different.
5
Every single experience is awesome. Real wholesome food and super delicious - made with a lot of love and personal attention by the owner and the very friendly staff. Highly recommended
5
This small restaurant offers delicious middle eastern food at a very reasonable price. The houmous and the babaganoush are just delicious with the right dosage of tahini and lemon. We took the labne and the falafel pitas, just delicious! We will come back for sure to taste the tabouleh and the rest! Nice staff and nice neighbourhood
5
We sampled Fill a Pita during an afternoon outing to Chinatown in Singapore. Our selection was the signature pita with a side of garlic hummus. The food was absolutely delicious, we were also provided with a lentil side dish which was complimentary, much appreciated! Though not typically vegetarians, this eatery is innovative, produce is so fresh, full of variety, and the owner is extremely helpful, providing us with recommendations of other good eateries nearby. Fill a Pita is simply put an absolute delight, would 100% recommend!!
5
Absolutely devoured the labneh pita during our visit today! The food is so honest to goodness authentic and the owner makes sure you have a delectable meal. The hummus is a personal favorite along with the falafel. We had a great lunch today and were pleasantly surprised by the complimentary dates the owner offered after wards. Love this place 
4
overall i and my friend ordered their signature pita with corriander hummus, its a joint filled with caucasians and expetriates, I and my friend are the only asians during lunch hours, lol, the food turns out to be flavourful, packs a punch, the hummus with pita goes well as well
5
I went there because of the strong recommendation from Singaporean vegetarian people and I wan't disappointed. I had hummus, coriander hummus, babaganoush, fava beans, falafels with pita. They are all fresh and yummy. I loved the coriander hummus the most. So smooth and refreshing. It doesn't have strong coriander flavour, just right flavour! Pita is made from wholemeal flour, which is a big bonus for me! A coconuts shop is next to the shop and you will get $1 off when you bring the receipt from Fill a pita. I saw people having ice cream, coconuts deserts and raw coconuts water after the meal and I did as well! Hassan, the owner is super friendly and answer all my health geeky questions. This place is perfect for healthy lunch or snack. Great vegan menu, too! I would love to come back for rice dish!!!
5
My first time to this. Very yummy Falafel pita. Will like to try koshari rice and hummus soon. No wonder the restaurant was packed every time I passed by ~
5
Fill-a-Pita is a really amazing find, here in Singapore. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, which is great in itself, but what really sets them apart is the stellar service that you receive. Hassan and his staff always go the extra mile to make sure that their customers are fully satisfied and it's such a welcome change from the attitude at most places in Singapore. I can't recommend this place highly enough for an affordable, delicious meal, with staff that really care about your experience
5
The new location is so much nicer than the old one on Shenton Way! The pita was a good size and seemed very fresh. Will return.
5
It is a pleasure to have my lunch in this restaurant. Very Good Food, I recommend in particular the Koshari Rice and the platter for two. Nice staff too!
5
Been here several times .. Still love it !!! Sorry no photo .. We ate them all ☺️. Food is always consistent . We be back again for sure .
5
It was a pleasure to eat there. We had a variety of dips and bread for 12$ each and we were really happy with our choice. We will surely return
5
I went to Fill a Pita after hearing great reviews. It was packed between 12noon and 2pm so I walked around and got there at 2:30pm. Hassan, the owner, recommended and created a special platter for me. It was absolutely amazing! I wiped the entire platter clean. I saw Hassan and his staff going from customer to customer making sure everyone was happy. One of the customer's even needed directions to Sentosa and Hassan took great care in helping her figure out a route. A word about the food, Koshari Brown rice and falafels are really popular and therefore run out. Good times to go are before 12noon or after 2pm. Deforest go there...and say hi to Hassan. I eve took a picture with him outside the restaurant
4
Love this place! Just had lunch here after searching for a healthy and quick meal. Lovely service with delicious Mediterranean food choices. Also a good place for those who are vegan. I got a fava bean pita ($8.00) which was filling and well-portion. I recommend this place
5
We come here through the tripadvisor recommendations. This was our first experience wit these type of food so we can't really comment much if it's authentic or not. We did feel that a little bit more vegetables would make the dishes even better (but like I said may be this is not the way it's supposed to be). In general when we go to a vegetarian place we like to eat more vegetables. Other than that, great place, clean, nice service, nice fresh drinks
5
Came here for lunch and had 2x pitas, 1x Hummus, 1x Koshari brown rice and 2x drinks all together for 27 S$. The food was fresh and delicious and the service very friendly. Would come here again and can recommend this place for a nice lunch
5
High quality products, generously filled pitas (had the falafel one and the cheese one). Very tasty too. The hummus was delicious too, seemed homemade. And Im very fussy with food! Friendly and welcoming owner too. Perfect lunch for us after exploring the city and literally starving! Would love to have such a place near our home place so we can go again
5
You can choose between different pitas (we went for one falafel and one fava bean), at about 8 S$ per piece, choose the sauce (yoghurt-chili or not), can go for juices or choose the freshly provided tap water. Also ordered hummus (different versions), pickled vegetables. The woman at the cashier knew the names of the customers who ordered before us! The food is vegetarian / vegan, super fresh and very moreish. You can sit inside the little street restaurant or outside and watch people heading by from/to their lunch break
5
The food is good and affordable. Perfect combination.
The people there are really friendly and welcoming. Great ambience. Would definitely come again!
5
I love this middle eastern food joint so much! It's a great find in the CBD area. The lunch crowd is manageable, but most importantly, the service is so good that it really sets itself apart from everyone else. I sometimes come in alone for a meal and find that the owner and staff are wonderful people who will make sure your every need is met and they do it with the most genuine smile possible. I usually order the falafel pita which has always been good. The falafel is comparable to those I had in the US but better than most that I had in Singapore. It is really fresh and hearty. I recommend this eatery with great zest! - Collee
5
Came here again, because first time was already closed. I really enjoyed the food, had some falafel pita and babaganoush, my boyfriend ordered the hummus with pita and was very happy with that choice, too. The food as the ingredients taste fresh and are well prepared. I can definitely recommend that place and will come back if I am in Singapore again
5
We had very pleasant experience in Fill a Pita. Staff was very friendly and spoke good (native?) english. The actual food (Pita with three falafels and some home made humus) was great! They even put some extra garlic, when we just said that we really love it. Singapore is really expensive city, so this was very cheap lunch in the context (6-8 euros per person)
5
Fantastic food. Great value for money. Upgraded location is great. Avoid the rush hour from 1230 - 115. Wish they open for an early dinner too.
5
Fill-a-Pita is a great little food outlet. The quality of the food is top notch and portion sizes ensure that you're going to be full. The staff are super friendly and the prices are very reasonable too. There are a lot of options, and it is a great place for vegetarians that want a bit of variety too. Seating is available (but is very limited during the lunch time rush) and obviously they do take-away
3
Saw the rave reviews of Fill A Pita, and given that I love my falafels, and spent a big chunk of my life in the middle east (Kuwait and Dubai), I decided to drop by and try the place out.Pros: Reasonably priced felafel ($9) and decent sized filling too. The pickles (or thurshi as they call it in the mid east) are an extra at $1.50, and quite close to the originalsCons: The pita bread I got wasn't soft - in fact, it was quite on the crispy side which I found a bit odd. The wrap was a bit dry too, and I felt that there just wasn't enough Tahini in it. Could be because the pita bread itself was a bit on the dry side.I'd give it a 3 for now, but will head back again next week to try and taste the other dishes on the menu. Hopefully the pita will be better next time around
1
Had a quick lunch here considering the rave rating on TripAdvisor we thought we'd try it out. Was disappointing, the falafel pita was not very tasty, food took a while, tables are few, and the falafel itself was old, not crisp. Felt like it had been standing for a while.You can get better falafel and pitas elsewhere in Singapore, this was disappointing
5
Fill a Pita moved! Gone from the noisy hole in the wall that was Shenton Way, far away from the chain smoking mahjong boys outside and the fly-infested Kopi shop they once shared a common space with, Fill a Pita did the unthinkable -- they went upscale and uptown in Chinatown. Not easy to find (because Google maps have it a bit wrong as of this writing), FaP is located on the new Nankin pedestrian food enclave at 01-29 (across from Food Collective). How's the food? Still outstanding! Simple, delicious, easy, healthy... It's still a 3* Michelin experience for under $10 $ing (only one menu item is more than $10). You can't go wrong, if you can find them!!!I'm a big fan of the Labna Pita and Babaganoush with a side of olives -- all for a bank-busting, wallet-scorching $11. Go to Fill a Pita and enjoy a little of the Mediterranean's gustatory pleasures!
5
I've been away for some times and it's been a really good surprise to discover the new shop. Great location, nice and clean environment. Also happy to see that the good things such as friendly staff, good value and quality food remains the same!Congrats and all the bes
5
I'm a regular here for lunch in Singapore. Love the pita - wonderful falafel and hummus. The staff there are extremely friendly and take great pride in making delicious food. Not an extensive menu but everything is extremely well done. Thank you!
5
Food was really good and the staff was really friendly as well. :) as they serve vegetarian food only this place is a great address for Foodies who love veggies
4
Visited this place with wifey and kids. Not the usual joint one would expect. Located on main Shenton Way and shares the shop with a beverage stall. The Haloumi sandwich & Lebnah sandwich were one of the best I have had in a while. Everytime we pass by this place, my son asks for the Haloumi Sandwich. I think the Felafel & Hummus recipe be improved. On the whole, I would love to go back there again and definitely have their Haloumi Sandwich. Though the timings should be a little extended.PS: The owner of the shop is quite pleasant and kind. Not the usual talkative kind but pleasant to talk to
3
I have lived in middle east for more than 18 years and hence my expectations were high. The Pita and falafel are just average. But it is far better than the ones you get in Arab Street. I am still hunting for a good falafel and pita in Singapore. The place is small and during lunch time its hard to get a place if you are not early. However the service is quick. Price is a bit on the high side for the ambiance
4
It's no wonder why Fill a Pita is rated so highly on tripadvisor - they have friendly staff, generous and tasty portions, and will not burn a hole in your pocket. The only little issue is location - I work around the CBD, so getting there obviously isn't a problem - but frankly don't see why tourists would go out of their way and go to Shenton House. That is all
5
From the outside, you wouldn't expect such great food from this place as it looks a bit rusty. Don't let yourself get confused through this. Food is excellent and very reasonably priced. A must-eat in SG
5
We came here twice during our SNG visit and were blown away by Fill-A-Pita! We took a tasting plate so we could try 6/7 dishes. They were all to die for, everything is so fresh, tasty, surprisingly delicate. Falafel was the best I've ever had, humus was top notch and there was this creamy fresh cheese with herbs and spices - omg, omg! The owner is extraordinary friendly, passionate and will cater you like best friends do.Out of the roof experience! Fill-A-Pita story has a bright future
4
Limited menu of falafel, hummus, etc but well executed. It is a part of a food stall so there is no real ambience but a good place to have a quick bite. I have been here numerous times and the food quality is always good.
5
People, if you want some seriously delicious food in your tummy for just a few bucks, this is the place to go. Their pitas taste like heaven! I suggest you try their Haloumi cheese pita or their red chili beans pita, as well as the coriander hummus. It tastes like pure joy, fills your tummy and you feel healthy afterwards.You also have a juice place in the same spot, so afterwards, you can grab a Lime juice with ice to get a nice refreshment for 1.50 SGD $!The owner was super helpful to us and even sat down with us after we ate, once the lunch rush had passed, to give us many awesome suggestions of things to do in Singapore based on our interests. Talk about overdelivering! Thank you so much, HIGHLY recommended place. Very good value for the buck. I read in a comment here that someone said there were only 1 or 2 tables to sit, it's not true at all, they have at least 6 to 8 tables and you can definitely have a place to sit (even higher probabilities if you don't go during rush hours), so please do a favor and just go there if you want some Delicious Cheap Eats :D.Hope this helped
5
This place is the best place to have veg food in singapore(even if you dont like veg food you are gonna like it).The taste,the price,the quantity and the owner everything is amazing.Hassan,the owner is a very nice person and also a learned man.Expect the best service but no fine dine.Overall the best meal we had in sg
5
Every time I visit Singapore I visit this place for fresh vegetarian Egyptian, middle eastern food. The pitas are delicious and I love the hummus and the tabouli salad. Also the pickle plate is good as a side dish. Simple concept with good quality food. Also very filling. Will be back next month
5
We visited as a family after hearing it from friends and reading reviews. It is a small eatery, Not a fancy restaurant. That's about the only thing you can critique.The personalised service from Hassan was superb. The food was out of the world. We have eaten quite a lot of falafels around the world and this ranks on the top. My kids enjoyed it so much, that we are already thinking about visiting it soon ! It is definitely worth a visit and food is reasonably priced. Hassan is very polite and courteous. Go for it 
5
I went to Fill a Pita as my boyfriend is a regular and said i must try it. After going i can see why he is a regular. I love the falafels at Fill a Pita so much, they're the best i've ever had. The overall Pita was really delicious and i'm constantly craving it. The pita is really filling however the food was so good so my boyfriend and i ordered some pita bread and hummus and coriander hummus which was really delcious also. I personally prefer the coriander hummus as it has a bit more flavour but both humus' were really delicious. Although being a new visitor to Fill a Pita, Hassan the owner was really welcoming and friendly towards us. Thank you Fill a Pita for the making such a great food
5
First this is not a full service restaurant. It is a simple take away joint with very basic sit and eat facilities. This review is not about their ambience.Their food quality is very good. I tried a fava bean pita and coriander hummus. They were as good as one can get outside of places like Jordan.And it is a completely vegetarian joint.And the owner personally is involved in the preparation and provision of the food.Very good food quality and cost effective
5
Simply tasty and tastefully simple. There's nothing more beautiful than something simple beautifully accomplished. Fill a Pita has an extraordinarily simple menu that is just scrumptious. Don't overdress for this hole in the wall joint on Shenton Way. It's crowded, noisy, and full of the hustle bustle of the work crowd. A local Kopi shop joins Fill a Pita, so you can fill your drinks order 2 meters away, BUT do not let any of this deter you from the fresh deliciousness awaiting you. The falafel is just excellent, the side of tabouli was better, and the prize dish was the pita with Labda cheese filled with chilis and olives I took for takeaway. It didn't last long cuz I ate it all before I got to the car. The food is worth the haj, it's inexpensive, and I think it's well worth the top-notch rating!When a place like Fill a Pita is "top ten" in foodie Singapore, what does that tell you? It's pretty good!
5
Had falafel and a few salads and they were so fresh and delicious! It is conveniently located near Tanjong Pagar MRT station, about 5 minutes walk. It's not opened for dinner and on Sunday. Been there twice but would love to go back again
1
This is not really a 'restaurant', but more of a coffee shop. It has no air condition, you have to pay by the counter and the food is more like hawker style and I was mislead by the pictures provided by restaurant. The dishes we had were blend and nothing special at all. The table was also dirty during our visit and it felt as if they were short of staff as it had not been cleaned properly
5
Excellent food and fantastic friendly service. Fruit juices next door . Great value for money. Strongly recommended.
5
Fill a Pita has the best Falafel pita in Singapore. Hassan and crew are great hosts, making you feel at home when you visit. Also try their Fava Bean pita and Coriander hummus
5
Went in there for a quick bite their hummus pita falafel everything was a delight. Owner is very charismatic and personally takes care of all your needs
5
Had 30 mins. Picked the restaurant off trip advisor. Ordered their 2 best sellers, falafel pita and coriander hummus. Both were excellent. Portions are also great. Service prompt, friendly and efficient. Great place. Will definitely go there again. Maybe tomorrow? :)

Went there for quick lunch. Restaurant seems very busy and too crowded, maybe because during lunch time.The food is good but not the best vegetarian food I ever had
5
Very simple place with no AC but, fantastic tasty veggie food, we arrived late in day and a couple of things were off the menu,but what we did have ,left us looking forward to another visit ,the man who served us was a star, he really went the extra mile to ensure 100% customer service,can't wait to go back !!

I work closeby and have visited the place many times for Lunch. Everything is made fresh and it's delicious. Service is better than anything I have seen in Singapore. Owner is personally involved and takes good care of you. Heaven for vegetarians!

Having read some grt reviews i visited recently. Ordered the koshari and falafel pita. Firstly, i was touched by their excellent customer service which most of the eateries in singapore lack. So, having begun on a good note the visit was somewhat already a success (i travelled quite a bit to get there btw). The pita pocket was served with complimentary coriander hummus..it didnt blow me away but what i liked was its subtle flavors and simplistic taste. Pretty pleasant and filling i'd say. The koshari was something i'd never tried before and i quite liked it..my husband liked it better than the falafel pita. So, overall, the food was decent and i plan to go back to try some more of their dishes

Went their with my cousin today for lunch. It's a simple setting - tables, no aircon, but a very friendly crew. The food was exceptional and the Felafel pita was great. And so were the hummus, Lebanese cheese (or yogurt), pickles etc. And I did see a very friendly host! Will be back for sure!

The last time I had koshari was three years back at the famous Abou Tarek restaurant, Cairo. Ever since, I was trying to find a place that sells decent koshari but couldn't find any till I came across Fill a pita.Dined here on a weekday during lunch time just before the office crowd started to flood the place. I ordered two bowls of Koshari. I was pretty excited about having it after three years but the gentleman at the counter told me that they're serving Koshari with slight variation. They served it with brown rice instead of the usual white rice and there was no garlic juice, lime wedge, cheese and chic peas. This one had brown rice, tomato based sauce, pasta and fried onions. The serving was huge and definitely very filling. I love this variation as it's a healthier choice. Protein from legumes, carbs from brown rice. It's quite tasty too. May be next time I have some falafels and pitas
5
Amazing falafels and guess what.. all veg :). The coriander hummus serves as an excellent addition to the meal. Hassan is an amazing host and very friendly
5
Unbelievably tasty...fresh ingredients...Very friendly...personal attention from owner...very very consistent..
5
The best serve and best food you can get in Singapore!! all the food is prepared with love , passion and perfection!!!!
5
Fantastic food, super fresh, unbeatable Falafel and Tabouleh. Ideally, the venue should be on par with the quality of the food, so best to take away

Popped to this place on a Saturday lunch having read such great things - the construction works locally were rather impinging on the venue's ambience, but I can't fault them for that! (And we went towards the end of 2014 so I don't know if they are ongoing). The important thing is: the food was delicious, and the owner friendly and accommodating. As a vegetarian who is allergic to MSG (and who can't abide the way Singaporeans ruin so many restaurant meals with its addition) this place is an oasis of real food. I can imagine that it gets crazy during the week, so go for a more leisurely weekend treat if you can :-
5
Visited this place with a friend on a Saturday afternoon, after having recommendations from my colleagues. The place lives up to the expectations and there's no wonder that this place is ranked quite high. Tried their signature best sellers and they were just about perfect. Good part is no frills and service charges (though they accept only cash). The host (Hassan) is very friendly and also gave us a complimentary token of appreciation in the end :) Definitely recommending to all

This place gets very busy but all dishes're good, well prepared and served.I hope to return soon to try other specialties
5
Found this Mediterranean food place and loved it! Reasonably priced, delicious array of salads etc. the falafel tasted great. Good choice of juices too! Would highly recommend a visit especially if you are vegetarian
5
Right in the middle of the city, next to Asia square building. I work there and this is the best source of inexpensive lunch for me. Very filling and definitely value for money! They have a lot of good options. Try the fava bean pita!
5
If you are in CBD and looking for Mediterranean/Mid-Eastern stall perhaps it's the only one, the food is pretty good & fresh. Particularly good if you are looking for something light since its Vegetarian. Having been dropping in every few months for Lunch or breakfast since this place opened. The owner is a very friendly & helpful guy and runs the place in a very calm manne
5
went for lunch today and had a couple of wonderful Pita's, served by the owner who was very friendly and helpful. we will defiantly go back her
5
what a brilliant concept this little place is. Was in Singapore on business and after reading the reviews I was not disappointed. I was surprised how cheap the food is, everything under $9, the food is fantastic, amazingly fresh and very satisfying. Service was very friendly and Hassan made me feel very comfortable as if we had known each other for years, but had just met as he was explaining the menu to me. I wanted to try everything on the menu but just couldn't fit it all in. Hummus was delicious in fact everything I ate was. Very simple menu but everything on it packs a punch of middle eastern flavours. I'm a meat lover and I was actually surprised how much flavour was in the food, for not having any meat. Vegetarians and vegans paradise this place. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore, seriously u must give this place a try, 100% u won't be disappointed

Love it here. Great food, friendly service and clean and cozy environment. Very affordable too; real value for money. Highly recommended!
5
Run by a former banker - excellent service - very personalized ! Don't miss this place - very basic with great value for money and fantastic food. Ask for Hassan !!
5
Came here for lunch one day and it was busy, was really cool to see all the locals going about their day and stopping a grabbing a pitta. the hummus and the falafels were amazing, couldn't stop thinking about them and so cheap! Will miss this plac
5
I am 7 months pregnant ,and been craving falafel like crazy ;) Found Fill a pita on line ,and made a trip to the other side of town to try ;) . Well worth the trip .Delicious and super cheep ,considering the size of the portion you get .If this place was close to my house would eat there every day

Go meet Hassan El Nahas. Hass – as he is known to his friends – holds a Harvard MBA and is the former Head of ABN Amro’s Private Banking in the Middle East, and long-time banker in Singapore. Hass does not fit the archetype of a typical banker – he is soft-spoken, even keeled, and often gives a measured pause before giving a thoughtful answer. Perhaps that is why banking took its toll on his soul, which led him to take a sabbatical to revisit his Egyptian homeland 2010, coincidentally before its own version of the Arab Spring. Hass returned to Singapore with a clear vision in his head. It had nothing to do with managing wealthy people’s money and a lot to do with chickpeas. Hassan had a vision to open a café that would serve falafel, hummus, and other popular dishes that locals from his homeland would instantly love and appreciate. And he did. He opened Fill-a-Pita, located in a mini-food court in Shenton House on Shenton Way across from SGX. Perhaps it is a cliché, but love is the key ingredient to Hass’ food.  Hass tells me about how he had to throw away a big bag of chickpeas because they did not have a flavor that met his standards. And his eyes twinkle as he talks about cooking falafels to order so that they arrive to his customers crispy on the outside, steamed on the inside, and in absolute perfect condition. He laments about how he had to go through months of generating losses because he had to learn so many hard lessons about having to produce great food without compromising. And that is what makes Hass food great. He simply refuses to compromise. This banker is not in it to make money. His passion that drove him through his Harvard MBA and to the top at ABN AMRO’s private bank is now pushing his drive toward perfecting his falafel. And his personality comes through in his service. As the lunch time crowd files in, it seems that everyone in the line he knows and cares about. I sit down on the same plastic chairs that are at any other Kopitiam, but his food is amazing. And at only at S$6-9 per plate, it is easy on the wallet. My go-to Arab food used to be Urban Bites in Tanjong Pagar. But Hass’ Fill-a-Pita is just absolutely delightful. If you work in the area, you would be a fool to miss his place for lunch. I have other friends who have restaraunts and I politely smile and nod when I eat their food. But my enthusiasm for Hassan's food is genuine. This stuff is tasty

This is a great little place which serves delicious food! The salads are very healthy and Falafels taste great with the sauces. Also, given their central location, the price is also reasonable and actually very good value for money. Finally the service is one of the best aspects of the dining experience. They are always welcoming and friendly - recently I went for lunch and after my meal the owner came over gave me a bowl of pistachios! Look forward to take my wife there to dine.
5
Each time I eat here I question why I don't do it more often. The food is delicious, healthy (falafel is not oily at all) and the service is fast + friendly even though this place gets very busy. Is refreshing to see that the management actively listen to customer feedback (NGO, brown rice). Keep up the great work
5
OMG. I just had a fallafal at Fill-a-Pita and it was the best one I have ever had (and a have had a LOT)! The break was nice and crisp; the salad fresh and the fallafal very tasty and well spiced. The hot sauce is over the moon good. I can wholeheartedly recommend the place and will surely visit it once a week going forward!Make sure you get a fresh lime and soda from the place next door. Good too
5
I don't write reviews so often and today i simply couldn't contain the joy of having lunch at Fill a Pita! Koshari rice was mind blowing and the falafel was simply yummy. Personally i dint like too much of tangy flavor in falafel but if the choice of sauce is picked up carefully, it will be delicious! The owner gave a very personal touch to the order and this place is definitely a must try
5
WOW! Very delicious, healthy, fresh and zesty falafel pita/sandwich and humus! Can't go wrong with this place. It's a 'no frill' atmosphere with great service and a really great owner. He asked how our food was and genuinely cared about our responses.I wish you would sell humus by the tub!??? Can you?! Must go! Thanks again!davi
5
Living in Singapore for last 14 years. This is by far the best Felafal and Hummus in Singapore. Very friendly staff and reasonable price.
If you are Vegan, this is another good option in Singapore.

Great lunch place, not open in the evening. Super busy at lunch time, so you need some patience or try to go before or after the lunch rush hours. But don't go to late as they might be sold out!I tried several things on the menu already and.... liked everything :) The pita selection, tabuleh, hummus, salads, falafel, etc.... really great. Order some ice tea or lime juice to go with it and you have an amazing meal. The staff is uber friendly and the owner (even if super busy) always has time for a friendly note.
4
Owner is super nice to ask ur advices & opinions for the food!The taste of pita is yummy, but I have no idea of the sauce inside. But quite special
5
Working right across the street doesn't hurt chances of grabbing some falafel pita lunch...I picked up lunch here and it was so delicious. The best part I loved about the food here was it didn't make my tummy too full, I felt light even after munching the whole pita. To suit my taste perfectly, everything was so lemony/ citrus....owner is very friendly, would love to take my husband here as he loves Mediterranean food...may be on one of the weekends.....great work guys..
5
Fill a Pita is a real find!!Not only the food is delicious and fresh but the owner is very friendly and professional.It's a real heaven for vegetarian like myself but the food will please everyone. The place is unpretentious and simple but that what makes it an even better surprise. It's got character, not like all theses lookalike and packed food courts or chained restaurants around.I spend a lot of time in the Middle east and really enjoy the food there. Fill a Pita is exactly what I have been missing in Singapore!On the recommendation of the owner we had the falafel pita and some hummus and tabbouleh with warm bread on the side. everything was excellent! And on top that , prices are very reasonable!I will definitely be back often :)A must try

Dear All,My names Dharam & would like to thanks all for your reviews. As I was reading my mouth was watering.. I am scheduled to be in Singapore with family in Oct. 2014 (15th to 22nd) for Diwali vacations and being a vegan was reading reviews of a few when i came across Fill a Pita. Not only myself but my wife and more so my daughter are lovers of Hummas / Pita & Falafal so I am sure we will not miss this joint for sure. Just a note to the owners keep the Falafal & Hummas ready we are on our way..
5
I've had amazing Falafel in the Middle East/Northern Africa and North America, but in my 15-years living in Asia I have yet to taste authentic Falafel like this! The search is over. Fill a Pita is clearly family-owned (this must be a family recipe!), it comes across in the authenticity of the food (flavor and texture is amazing) and the service is unmatched! Everything I sampled was exceptional: the pita, the falafel, fresh vegetables/salsas, chickpeas, hummus, etc. And adding to the above is the fact that this modest eatery (quite literally, "a hole in the wall") is a gem of discovery that has more ambiance, character and charm than other Singapore eateries that will charge you 10-times the price, deliver an inferior meal, and frustrating service
5
never had falefels in my life before, but when i walked pass this unpretentious place one day, i just had the urge to try one. Got a whole Falefel sandwich and a side of Rice-bean-macaroni dish, which i cannot recall the name. For a meat and potato guy, i found the meal satisfying and filling. I even had a couple more Falefel sandwiches to take away. The owner, who happen to serve me that day, insisted that i eat it fresh but i still enjoy them as much, cold. No complaints. 2 thumbs up.Pricewise - very reasonable for such a location. In the words of SM Phua Chu Kang - Best in Singapore and JB...Some say Batam
5
My mum and I sought out Fill A Pita during our recent trip to Singapore due to the positive reviews on tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed. The owner was lovely and gave us free tasting of the Koshari rice (which was delicious!) and a fresh date to end our meal. The hummus was the best I've tasted and the falafel wrap was equally good. The price of food items was also very reasonable. Thank you for a lovely meal and a great experience
5
Recently met up with a friend at Fil A Pit for some Middle Eastern food, and both of us were really impressed with the quality of the food and the service in this unassuming location. Both of us has falafel sandwiches and shared a plate of hummus. Coming from the Middle East myself, I can confidently this is the best Falafel and Hummus I have had so far in Singapore. Keep up the good work guys
4
My first visit to this place today - I didn't expect much looking at the modest ambiance. But no complaints as the price is very reasonable and the Food is just great !!
Totally recommend this for all vegetarians and health-freaks!

Had Falafel here, owner very nice and polite. Falafel was tasty and fresh. Good place to have quick mediterranean food.
5
Middle Eastern food I have had in Singapore, in terms of food quality, price and Service ( what else is there?). Have eaten at Fill-A-Pita at least 5 times and have found it consistently exceptional ; the falafel, baba ghanoush, labne cheese, beans and the hummus are terrific. My favourites: the beans, red pepper hummus and the falafel.Still haven't tried the koshari rice; looking forward to that.Haven't come across a nicer / more hospitable proprietor in this town yet!Am hoping that someday Hassan opens somewhere on Orchard Rd for us non-CBD'ers.Keep up the outstanding work Hassan, and come to Orchard and the West ( Holland Village?) soon
4
Went specially to Shenton way to eat falafel and baba ganush in this tiny and crowde spot, but unfortunately the owner (which was very kind and attentive) said they didn't have my favourite dish with cooked eggplant. What a pity! However he suggested to eat my pita with falafel and taboulleh, and I loved it! So tasty! Will surely come back to eat tahine and baba ganush
5
A nice little gem tucked in Shenton Way. Owner was friendly & service-efficient ! The large falafel pita sandwich was truly awesome. Will return to try the favita bean pita & koshari..
5
I am a frequent visitor of Fil-a-Pita and it not only about the food which itself is best I have had in Singapore. You should visit it to see how good Hassan is in treating his customers.Keep up the good work Hassan. I know you are off for 4 days now (sad) but will surely pay a visit next week as well
5
I am not a vegetarian but with tasty food like this could be easily converted. Loved the Falafel and Ghanoush. friendly staff great service, a refreshing change for lunch. Although it is close to the business area and i was on a business trip, it is worth seeking out if you are just on vacation in Singapore and looking for a light refreshing lunch
5
For those of you who already know and are in love with Arabic cuisine will appreciate and come to love Fill a Pita. The first-timers will be amazed and will get to know what they have been missing!Fill a Pita has a philosophy of creating healthy homemade Arabic dishes that are easy to pick up and munch on for lunch, and is also great on time for those in the big business world.The hot fresh falafel are so good (and healthy, as they use healthy oils) when mixed with the cool fresh greens and veggies then a wonderful tahini sauce to close the deal.This place is growing and becoming so popular they are going to have to take over another stall or open another location soon.I recommend this place to all visitors and locals in Singapore
5
Having recently moved to Singapore, I have found it increasingly difficult to find a good, affordable regular eatery. Fill-A-Pitta is a brilliant place to go for just that- excellent food at an extremely affordable price. The falafel is genuinely the best I've had outside of the middle east, with the accompaniments such as the tabouleh salad and labna (cheese) spread fresh and nutritious (there are also weekly specials). There are numerous kinds of hummus to choose from and Hassan and his team made me feel instantly welcome. The food is all prepared in front of you, and coupled with the warmth of the servers it feels like you're having a meal in a friends kitchen! I cannot recommend this place highly enough
5
If you like inexpensive eats, quick service and delicious middle eastern food then look no further than Fill-A-Pita. The Falafel is so fresh, the Baba Ghanoush the best I have tasted in Asia and the smiling service of Hassan the owner is worth the trip to visit them on Shenton Way in Singapore. Only open for lunch and you have to get there early or late (if anything left) to get a seat. $6 for half pita with baba ghanoush - in Singapore unheard of
