Food is pretty decent but portion could be slightly more. Quite cosy. Service was abit slow because of lack of staff.

We ordered army stew and steamed egg to share. Both were delish. The side dishes were refillable and yummy as well! Very good for sharing as well.

Visited with friends. Lady boss seated us in a private room for 5 of us. Seafood pancake n fried chicken were amazing. Ordered Army Stew too but a little under flavour. But after all, everything was awesome!

The set lunch here is totally worth the value. Service is fast and the Kimchi fried rice is good. Will definitely visit again.

Ordered Kamja Ramyeon and Bibimbap as mains for 2 to share and also a seafood pancake. Ramyeon seemed like a lot of msg was added, and meat was tough. Bibimbap was alright. Seafood pancake was crispy when it arrived but i felt that there was too much batter in it. Same comments as what I had heard for refill of 'Pan Chans'. Only topped up our kimchi once when asked. And when we requested for another serving of kimchi, server told us only once. So we asked for a refill of the others like beansprouts but he said it ran out already. It wasnt exactly packed that day, no idea which mice came in to eat their sides..... Luckily i used my entertainer 1for1, otherwise i would have felt that the food and service wasnt value for my money

There were some issues with the Entertainer app initially as the restaurant said that the system was not up although the restaurant was already listed in the app. Thankfully we sorted it out in the end. Prices are quite steep if not for the app, especially the Pork Collar which had a very small serving for $29. The seafood pancake was very yummy though
