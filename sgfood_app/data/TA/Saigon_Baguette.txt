Convenient since it is just above the mrt station. The winter and summer rolls were really fresh and tasty. The space is a little congested but the good service made up for it.

Frequent diner at the Suntec Outlet. I love the set meal options that are served deuing lunch rush hour. The service staff are really polite, smiling and friendly. Banh Mi, Fresh spring rolls, pork chop rice and Hue Noodle Soup are great!

Try the Bun Bo Hue and the combination pho. I was really pleased (and my taste buds) to have found this place.
The price is really affordable so thats a plus.
Will be coming back :D

Great tasting Pho bowls here, the Ban Mi's are fantastic too! The peanut sauce on the table is lush! Best of all is the prawn crackers.

I worked nearby and unfortunately I have no chance to try their dish before they shifted to Havelock II, luckily they just shift to havelock II and the branch at The Central has been closed. I order the chicken sandwich for my lunch and it's really very nice. The Vietnamese taste is there and wonderful. I ordered the soursop ice blended to beat the heat.The staff is very friendly and but the restaurant there is quite small which come with bar table and also some mini tables. Again the food is awesome. There're providing new opening promotion for when I visited them on (July 2017).The price is reasonable around mid-lower range.Cheer

Very good beef pho and mango salad, they provide plenty of fresh red chillies, beansprouts and lime on the side so you can add yourself for your tastes. (Personally i love blow your head off spicy!) seating is indoor only which is good as you need air con when you are eating v spicy pho! They do take away too. Service is very quick

Have passed this small eatery several times over the years but never tried it. Finally got the chance this evening and ordered myself a chicken baguette. Is it the best I've eaten? No. But by Singapore standards, it's not bad at all. Good balance of mayo, shredded veges and chicken with a crusty bread roll, this is good enough

The set lunch at Suntec cost S$14.9++ includes 1 main (4 options), 1 side, and a drink. I tried few of them: pork noodle, cabbage soup, spring roll, and mango salad. They all come in huge portions and taste pretty good. But my most favorite item is their Iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. The sweet taste is just right and so far been the best i've tried. Service was quick too. The place is facing the skypark so it's beautiful in day time

Served the usual Vietnamese dishes. Try the meat ball dry noodle. The noodle was not warm when served. Asked them to warm up the noodle. Instead they replaced a new bowl. The staff seems new. Food taste average, nothing great like those I eat in Vietnam

Well, i was informed by a friend that this place is just a so so vietnamese fast food quality place. Which i actually bought a groupon voucher to check out this branch at 1KM Mall (paya lebar)We ordered the vietnamese traditional roll, a fried version as well, beef ball soup, beef combination noodle, pork chop rice, a dry version of vermicelli. All the items were very tasty especially the beef broth.The mango salad with shrimp short of some ummphh and the banh siew (egg pancake) were not up to our expectation, not crispy and has a tinge of coconut flavour. We didn't try any of the banh mi, not able to comment on this. Service only was acceptable, when asked for service, they responded. Can check out this branch at 1KM Mall
