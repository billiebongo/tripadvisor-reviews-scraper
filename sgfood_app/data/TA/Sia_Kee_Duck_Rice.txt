Love the braised duck and the thick gravy sauce they use! The chill is is fantastic! Be prepared for the long queue! Parking can be an issue. But worth the efforts.

This got to be one of the best duck rice in Singapore. Although it's environment is a humble coffeeshop and not a fancy restaurant, Sia Kee served a delicious and tasty duck rice with peanuts, tofu and bean sprouts coupled with its special sauce which I couldn't find it anywhere else in Singapore ! You can have the duck with either rice or porridge which I find both worth the try. Parking is a challenge though as there are very limited parking lots around the area. It's a must try if you are visiting Singapore

First time here. I asked for mixed platter and got a large plate with dark rice. The duck was tender and the thick gravy not too salty but great flavour. The chilli dip deserves mention as it was tangy, just right. Couldn't help finishing the half bowl of rice I had. Along with the slivers of boneless duck there were taukwa, fishcake and duck liver. $15. I spied a fridge full of coconuts and I asked if they were Thai. Yes do I got one. So aromatic and sweetest. 2 thumbs up. $5 pricey but worth it

Located in a dingy old coffeeshop that smells and looks like 1980s Singapore, this coffeeshop also boast a sze char stall that Anthony Bourdain came to enjoy its all time popular crab mee hoon (only in the evenings). But during day time, it's Sia Kee that keeps the crowd coming despite the lack of amenities in the coffeeshop and the terrible heat in hot and humid Singapore. The son just loves their flavorful duck rice with its fragrant yam rice and its thick and delicious sauce. Although its actually more expensive than other popular duck rices across our island, for a satisfying duck meal, Sia Kee is comfortably one of the tops in our island

Went for lunch with parents and ordered a 3person meal. The whole plate of meat is not even half duck and I was charged $32.50 for it. I think I really look like carrot. Seriously the way they do business, I believe sooner or later no one will ever go again

Heard that they don't use Frozen duck but fresh duck.The LOR rice taste so perfect, they serve everyone a bowl of veg soup and the Duck is just to tender accompanied with generous serving of awesome tasty gravy.only Cons is that you will sweat it out eating there

Last weekend, I had the craving for duck and the craving wouldn’t go away. I suggested to my family to go to this duck rice stall for lunch. This stall has become very popular and most tables on the outside corridor were occupied, so we sat inside. The waiting time was about 15 minutes for our food to arrive. It used to take less than 5 minutes. We came around 1.15pm then and on this visit. As there were 4 of us, here’s our order:- Sharing Platter of Duck meat, fish cake, tou fu, duck gizzards, blanched bean sprouts and peanuts. All were cut and placed on a plate before the signature brown sauce was laden over it. Everything is good. Meat lovers can order more duck meat to go with the standard order. - Plain porridge (1 bowl): The rice is grinded and when cooked to be the porridge, it has a nice smooth texture. The signature brown sauce gives it a nice taste when mixed into the bowl of porridge.- Duck rice (3 bowls): Its cooked with gravy, so the color is brown and the signature brown sauce is laden over it before serving. The rice is fragrant and the aroma reminds me of glutinous rice. Rice is nice.The stall provides you little sauces with two types of chilli in it. There’s slightly sweet chilli paste and a tangy watery chilli sauce. Mix them and you get a nice unique blend of dip. It goes well with the duck. The meal also came with a bowl of soup, that’s has sliced cabbage and ginseng roots in it. Its mildly herbal but nice to drink.The meal cost me $20.Its rather pricey, but craving satisfied and we had a good weekend.One thing about this place is parking, and lots of customers double park their cars so parking enforcement comes rather often. Do park your car in proper lots!Recommended

as a resident in Geylang, I would say, this is the best Duck rice.The wait is definitely worth it (yes, you get seated and wait...) as you hardly can taste such authentic salted veg soup (with chinese herbs), and great tasting gravy!Beverage from the coffee-shop though is tad expensive..
