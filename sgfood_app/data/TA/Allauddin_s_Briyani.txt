Portions have shrunk, above average briyani. Rice is fragrant, but curry can be better. If you enjoy spicy food, look elsewhere, as this is muted down

The Mutton Briyani was so good, the staff were friendly, the tables were clean and it cost less than $10. What more could an Aussie traveler want!!

Another recommended place to try. The briyani is fresh and quite spicy, however very tasty. We took the chicken option which was yummy. Just opposite they make roti (same company) and worth trying as made to order.

Their bryani used to be very good but i think commercial success has brought about a watering of the quality. The chicken bryani i had had none of the garnishing i normally find with the rice. It was just two things on the plate. Rice and chicken. what happened to the fried onions and cashew nuts. The taste is also not there as it was. i think too many good Tripadvisor reviews have gone to their heads . Best to avoid until their quality picks up again. Try the other stalls nearby , you might find them to be slightly better. I made a special trip out of my way to visit this place , my last visit was a few years ago. Its a real shame that this has happened, the old man who was the owner would have been most disappointed

Review by Dr Sim. The briyani used to be very good. Now it is just good. Service is poor. Suggest you buy home to eat. Hawker centre is crowded, hot and humid. Tourist should buy back to hotel. Good but not great briyani. Regards Dr Si

I will give it a 3.5/10. Rewind back about 15years ago Alauddin used to serve one of the best briyanis in Singapore. Now it is just another stall selling some tasteless biryani. The rice is bland. Chicken is not flavourful. Acar is worse! seems like they have added some coloured powder to the cucumber to serve in the name of acar. The serving is huge tho (packet). You can eat this biryani for the same of telling people that you ate biryani. Nothing special

The biriyani is pretty flavoured and the chicken piece that comes is very large. The quantity of biriyani is large and I think not all can finish this. Its a bargain in $5 and I dont't think a better biriyani can be found in such a price.

Following some youtube research we thought the food here would be amazing. It was okay to be fair but nothing beats the eateries in places such as Food Republic. The briyani were order wasn't finished but the roti prata was very delicious. It's worth going to experience the mad rush, heat and atmosphere here of local life

After remembering where I was, I changed my rating. I'm in a hawker center paying $5 for a plate of chicken biryani. The serving was ample (I shared a plate) and enjoyed it with some pappadam. The experience was good, the service excellent, the taste good. It was recommended to us while taking a walking tour. And best yet, I am not sick this morning

Folks, I'm a strong briyani critic and don't be pulled in by media attention to this shop. Allauddin was offering the best briyani once in Singapore. Maybe 10 yrs back. But after they starting getting many reviews, people were forming long queues and the standard has gone down the drain since. In fact, even the briyani shops behind Allauddin's shop are equally as useless. In summary, all briyani shops in Tekka Market cannot offer any decent briyani

To me it was just passable. The curry spice was too strong to my liking. The rice was a bit heavy, not the fluffy kind which I prefer.

I had a big portion and very delicious chicken briyani for $5. You can get an extra egg for 5 cents. It's not very clean place, you have to eat with pigeon flying around.

A decent stall, located at Tekka. The food was ok, but I've yet to taste the authentic Briyani. I have tried superb biryani in indian and middle east, I am craving for good one here, but I was disappointed.

Simple and tasty biryani. I like their chicken biryani. I am not a meat fan, hence I don't like their mutton biryani. Their best selling point is their rice, not complex spices and very good.

This stall serves really good prata and mutton curry to go with it... I am definitely going back for more soon!!!

Have visited this food centre many many times over the years & often took Briyani rice as its my favourite . Have tried both Allauddin & few others as well.Allauddin is supposedly to be the most famous of all but definitely it is not the best overall. In fact, none of them are really good in every aspect. Some have great Briyani rice, others good curry, good mutton or chicken. But so far none is good in all.The mutton at Allauddin was tender & the rice not bad. Tried chicken before & it was not bad too. But find the curry a little too salty. Not great curry.Overall though, still prefer Allauddin Briyani rice as it has the best non perfect "balance." Though it does not fully lived up to its famous status

There were very wide range of reviews for this stall at Tekka Centre that I had to try this once. Sorry to say I was not so very impressed with the food. It was very average. The Biryani was fine but not over the mark. I possibly missed the Biryani made by the person a generation or two back. Egg Prata was ok. Mutton Liver too was fine. I would have however appreciated a better combination of spices for the Mutton Liver. Biryani was not the dum biryani variety but where rice and chicken curry are prepared separately and then mixed while serving. The stall is messy/dirty and so is the seating place outside. We can lower our expectation considering that it is a small stall but it is the method/taste that matters.The people serving at the stall needs to adjust their attitude. They maintain that they serve the best biryani but it is the overall experience that forms in the minds of the customer and this customer aint satisfied :

bought mutton briyani take away from this stall called allaudin @ tekka market, i have tried so many briyani stalls around serangoon area inclding tekka market, i would say this stall's briyani is the worst i have eaten so far, the mutton portion was hard almost 90%bone and flesh of mutton 10%. The rice was too plain, oily with yellow coloring but no aroma of a briyani as it should be, disappointing, the accar cucumber was too soggy. The dalcha gravy full of fats ( mutton fats ) and tasted like dhall gravy for chappati. i just wonder why people queue at this shop as to whether they know what briyani looks and tastes like?? and after getting the taste of this, i would never ever dream of going back to this stall. I think those stalls on the front like yakader and haniffa, acceptable briyani there.. just a hawker standard

When the senior Allauddin was cooking the briyani the taste was simply fantastic. Then his sons helped him and slowly the transition began and the standard was still good under the watchful eyes of the Elder Allauddin. But now it so commercialised the standard is no longer like those days but stil one of the better briyani's in Tekka
