If I could I would have given minus 5 points. I have tried several dozen Michelin restaurants all other the world. And this one is just BOTTOM, not even for Michelin rating but for any restaurant. The food was simply disgusting. We couldn’t even finish a half of it.
2
We made a special effort to visit this Michelin starred venue and were impressed by the long queues waiting patiently to order. Certainly didn't mind the 40 min wait, chatting happily to other folk in the queue and expecting great food.But oh dear.....how very, very disappointing it was. Nothing special, not particularly tasty, and rather boring, certainly not half as good as other Chinese restaurants we tried later on in the city. e.g.JumboHow on earth does food of such poor quality warrant such a prestigious award we wondered? Surely we can't be the only ones to have been so disappointed. Our faith in the Michelin standard has been severely damaged

Have to queue 30mins to an hour every time. But it was worth it. The best BCM around. Although for $10 I would thought the portion would be more. The liver is cooked just right and not over cooked. The combination of vinegar etc is perfect
4
This is something different and special to try because its my first time having vinegar based pork noodle, be it dry or soup based, its just really tasty for a person who is a fan of vinegar. So if you dont like vinegar, avoid! For the price I paid, everything comes in the bowl is worth it. I went on a regular Sunday, started q-ing at around 11am and got my bowl of noodle at 12.30pm. So, its advisable to get there and q really early or avoid Sunday!

We came to the restaurant after lunch time but the line wasn’t looked long about 30 people ahead of us. But one person waiting but may ordered many bowls of noodles. The owner prepares one bowl at the time to ensure that the noodle was correctly done. He would keep putting a scoop of fresh water to the soup to make the taste stable not too salty after long boiled. Every bowl was measured with the sauce and ingredient. We order small size but both dried (Gan Mian) and white noodle soup (Guo Tiao Tang) and meat ball soup. They cost SGD 6 each. The taste was delicious and nice tasty soup.

We went there for lunch and had to wait almost for an hour in the hot shop. This place was very small and didn't have many tables, so some of the customers got their food but didn't have a place to sit down. So we had to designate one of our members to hang out to get a table as soon as it's available while two of us stood in line. The pork noodles was really good, but be aware that it included pork liver just in case you don't like liver. Overall the dish was well prepared and the taste was very satisfying
4
I got there at around 11:30 and the line looked manageable, maybe 15 people ahead of me so I was quite happy. after I did not move at all for about ten minutes, the reality sunk in, this place is SLOW! My guess is the reason for it is that several groups only had one person in the line ordering for groups of 4four or five, so in reality the line was more like 80 folks...I waited 175 minutes in the heat with a few fans helping from time to time. The cooking crew was working like crazy and it was fun to watch them. When it was my turn I ordered #3, and I really liked it! The peppers made it nicely spicy, the different pork textures were super interesting. The ambiance is typical hawker stall, very authentic. I got a medium portion for S$6. There is also an option for S$4 small or S$8 for large. I would go back there
4
We came here for lunch and waited about 1.5 hours in the sweltering heat. I would definitely recommend coming as early as possible or during off-peak times to avoid waiting. Also, even if the line looks short the wait time may still be deceivingly long as many people were ordering like 6 - 12 dishes to go at a time so the short queue still took forever.This restaurant is famous for its Bak Chor Mee, which was awarded a 1 Michelin Star. They offer 3 different sizes at $6, $8, and $10 price points. I opted for the $8 portion size, and along with the soup it was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. You have the option of ordering the dish with either thick or thin noodles, and either with soup or dry style (the dry comes with soup on the side FYI).This Bak Chor Mee included minced pork, pork slices, meat balls, liver, a dumpling, and deep fried fish pieces for crunch. I have never had this dish before, so this is my one and only experience and I have nothing to compare it to. Please be warned that if you do not enjoy liver and/or vinegar I don't think you will enjoy this dish. I personally am a big fan of both so this dish was a winner for me. I added some of the fresh chilies which I felt were necessary to add spice to balance out the vinegar flavor. The noodles were sweet yet salty, tangy yet spicy; it's quite hard to describe the flavors of this dish. The soup that came on the side was also very delicious and refreshing compared to the strong flavors of the noodles.Overall this was a very good restaurant and the dish was very unique and tasty. However, I don't think it deserves a 1 Michelin Star when I compare it to other 1-starred eateries such as Nakiryu in Tokyo, Wako in San Francisco, Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong, etc

Few years ago visited this stall and queue for 1hr+. at that time I realised the stall owner was super slow and rather disorganised. I would not have revisit this stall if it was not my mum who wished to eat here.To my surprised, although the queue was not as long as my previous visit, it took me at least 1 hour waiting and worst there were at least 8 or more people in front of me. That is not the end, fyi after queuing for the order, you will still need to wait again for collecting the food. at least another 30min - 1 hour waiting.Although stall owner having 2 helpers, but it doesn't seems to help him at all.I will never go back again for sure

Visited earlier this year around March, and just returned for a second time. The food, while good, was better the first time around (most notably, the sauce had more “punch” to it the first time, and seemed a bit watered down this time around). The noodles were also on the soggy side. We arrived about 10 minutes before then open but was already number 12 in queue. We ordered the $10 version which was just enough for one hungry person.
5
We headed here on a hot and sweaty day. We waited in line for about 30 minutes and it was worth it. The pork noodles were so good! One of the cheapest Michelin star meals you can get in Singapore!

Whilst making my research on a trip to Singapore, this food stall caught my eye being rated 1 Star in Michelin Guide 2017 for Singapore, also being ranked No. 1 in the World Street Food Masters List 2017. I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like "I'll come back one day". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it
4
Revisited the store after a long break of 4-5 years. Quality still good but price has gone up to minimum S$6 for the smallest serving, with one Michelin star it probably worth the price. Queue after 7pm is much shorter but some choice of noodle was sold out. Recommend to try the dried Mee Kia (thin yellow noodle) or Mee Por with a dash of chilies plus a meat ball soup. Thank goodness it’s still delicious.
5
We arrived at 2pm and only had 5 people in front of us. Took about 20 minutes. So don’t be deterred, just try! Paid $8 for the standard noodle dish and it was very nice. The ‘dry’ noodle dish was far -FAR- more tasty than the noodle soup dish! We ordered a little spicy, which was just right
3
We were lucky to arrive at a time when it was not too busy, so only waited for about 45 minutes in total. We had the #2 and #3 and both were prepared individually while we watched, so we knew that everything was fresh and hot. The tastes and spices were very mild - not very exciting and certainly not worth a Michelin star in my opinion. In general, it was below average overall
4
This place is Michelin rated, and I decided to give it a try. Shop opens at 9:30am; I got there around 9:20am, and people have always picked up numbers and waited in line. I got number 22, and the wait was exactly 2 hours. At 11:30, I finally got to order my food. Be there early if you want to avoid the wait. People, who got there around 8:45am, were number 12-13, and that’s one open wait after opening. Get there early (as early as you can). Food itself was great! I got #3, which is dry noodle with various sides. It was nothing like things I have had before. It was sour, sweet, spicy, salty, and all of them combined (hard to describe). Do note that each plate comes with pork parts, such as liver. I didn’t know but ate it all. If parts are not something you would enjoy, I wouldn’t recommend the place. Wait is ridiculous but food isn’t bad :)

Actually that is a good example of storytelling. The owner started to work being young something like 50 years ago. So it’s a family tradition to work in such a business and finally story needed with an award. That was more the reason to have One star, not the food I think. So, mind it. Once you’re ready to spend the time for honing there, staying 40 mind in a queue just for having noodles - you’re welcome. But don’t expect much.
4
This review is getting a good review.We used to think this stall is the best but did not feel the same today. It could perhaps be due to the fact that they ran out of mee pok and mee kia didn’t turn out quite well for us. But they did cook the liver perfectly which ain’t easy. We arrived at 6pm and waited for 40 mins. We ordered the medium sized bowl at $8 and pork ball soup at $6. Would we go back again? Probably not since is not the best for us and the long wait is a deterrent.

Located behind singapore ICA. Another fave of home made noodle. They called this bak chor mee. My choice is always mee pok (flat egg noodles). They got mee pok n mee kia (thin egg noodles). This bak chor mee comes with mince pork n meat ball. They open at 930am.Got few ppl queuing since 9
1
I agree with one of the other reviewers. 1 Michelin Star basically means it’s a good place to stop by. Shouldn’t there be some time requisite or criteria to award the Michelin Star? I’m literally waiting in the queue right now for a good 40mins already. Another 40mins to go... I have not tried the noodles but being a Singaporean, I HIGHLY DOUBT it is going to be mind blowing. So if you’re a tourist, your time is better spent elsewhere

1 Michelin Star minced pork noodles. 1 star price from $6, $8, $10. 1 star Queue. nice fried dry fish and i lived the soup.
1
After 1.5 hour-queue, i will definitely not comeback as the food is just moderate and the service very very poor.
5
I will give 10 point if there is a button for me to click! By looking at the way of preparing a bowl of noodles, I can see how focus and details for them to serve it. Not only delicious , this street food also clean compare to other street food. Will visit again next time
2
We decided to try one of the new Michelin hawker stalls, and as this was nearby we went. As it was after 3pm, we had to wait for about 20 minutes in the queue, which wasn't too bad. The broth didn't have much depth, and I thought it was under seasoned. The noodles were ok, but nothing to rave about. One Michelin star means "A good place to stop by while on your journey." I think there's no need to stop here as you can probably find the same standard or better elsewhere without the queue

Review by Dr Sim. There are several outlets. The best outlet is at Crawford Lane. This is the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore. Queue is usually very long. Recommend tourists to try. However, tourists should buy the food back to their hotels. No air-conditioning. Very uncomfortable. The noodles are more expensive than normal. Cook is so rich that he drinks beer instead of soft drinks. Try the Bak Chor Mee dry with a hint of chilli. Regards DrSim00

came here, waited for 1.30 hours just want to try the noodle, but yeah, not as good as i imagined. very strong livery taste which i don't like. but my friend was a liver junkie and he quite like it. so it's personal opinion.i won't come back here again because the taste really below average.when was waiting in queue, my friend wait, i wander to the back of their stall, found another bak chor mee seller and i try to order it, $3.i think it was a lot lot better than tai hwa pork noodle. for people who not like liver, i think should try the $3 bak chor mee.spend $50 for 2 tai hwa pork noodle + extra dumpling with 2 bee

Knowing the fact that the queue would be crazily insane during meal peak hours, we decided to have an early dinner (around 4:30pm) on a weekday. Despite that, we still waited for 45 minutes so you can imagine the queue during peak hours or weekends! The noodles come with 3 prices (small - S$6, medium - S$8, and large - S$10), choice of dry or soupy, and type of noodles (mee pok or thin noodles). While waiting for the noodles to be ready, you can have a good look at how the owner is preparing each bowl with great attention and consistency. Guess that explains the wait. Our bowl of large noodles came with all porky goodness - generous portions of tender minced pork, pork slices, pork liver, bouncy pork balls, juicy dumplings, tossed harmoniously with black vinegar, chilli paste and some special sauce, before sprinkled with crispy pork lard and deep fried fish skin. The taste was truly remarkable! We don't think we can get anything close to that back in Kuala Lumpur. While the queue was somewhat unbearable due to the heat and hunger, I would still recommend to give it a try (during non-peak hours on a weekday of course)! The stall is within walking distance to Lavender MRT Station and located in a food court at the ground floor of a residential building.

I seriously wonder how this Mince Pork Noodles gets its 1 michelin star accreditation? Firstly, its over priced for a bowl of minced pork noodles with no special ingredients starting from the price of minimum $6 per bowl!! How ridiculous is that ... Basically it only has few slices of pig's liver, 2 pork balls, some mince pork and few slices of pork and 2 dumplings. The chilli was too salty and the vinegar was too much which i did not request for extra vinegar! Anyway, this will be my last time patronising and the Q wasnt that long when i went but the service was very very slow, resulting in customers queuing for a long time
4
The queue looks short but it takes forever. Remember to download some movies to watch offline before coming here. Other than that, the taste was great. Probably the best bak chor Mee in Singapore. But then again, I was probably so hungry by the time it was my turn that anything decent would have tasted good
5
I am giving my 5 star rating on taste and taste alone. Yes I did my time in the long annoying lines under uncomfortable climate conditions long before they earned the Michelin Star but I kept coming back because of the taste. IMHO they serve my favorite bak chor mee (肉脞面) out of so many other great stalls in Singapore because everything from the noodles, to the meat ingredients and the sauces are freshly prepared and perfectly combined. The bak chor mee is served two ways - soap base or soup on the side ('dry'). I like mine soup on the side (which probably is the more popular of the two), with mee pok noodles (which looks like tagliatelle). The bak chor mee comes with sumptuous dumplings, pork slices, minced pork, great tasting meat balls, and probably Tai Hua's best ingredient - delicious deep fried, crispy pieces of fish, and of course pieces of deep fried lard. The signature sauce is a harmonious blend of vinegar, soy sauce, and chili paste etc. Make sure to take the time to mix and blend the noodles and all the ingredients and sauces well before eating. Before your turn in line is up, the stall assistant will motion you over to custom your order(s) according to the type of noodles, and amount of spice etc. They also optionally provide sliced red chili pepper that will really kick up the spice level a notch! There are other affiliated Tai Hua stalls but this stall at Crawford Lane is da bomb! I believe the big difference is the attention given to the preparation of every single ingredient and done so consistently year in year out. It's no wonder why this particular stall is awarded the Michelin star and deservedly so.By the way one reason why the line is so long is because hardly anyone orders just one order, most seem to order an average of 4, and the last time I was here, the dude just in front of me ordered 10! The best part though is the chef does not compromise on quality - he works briskly but gives the same care and attention to every single bowl he prepares
4
The Meatball Soup taste Great. Really like it, but we don't like the Long Queue Time, but the staff already working hard to make the Queue Time Shorten. The Pork Noodle taste good.
5
Does it deserve the 1 star? I think so. Here's a tip, if the line is straight, it will probably take an hour. If the line makes an L, expect a 2-hour wait. The noodles itself is comfort food. Think of a bowl of hot noodles mixed with all kinds of meat (including bacon!) and doused with black vinegar. The preparation is fun to watch, considering they've been at it since 1932
4
This coffee shop noodle stall sells nothing but bar-chor-mee. Pls expect long waiting time... we waited an hour in the queue..... Noodles are well cooked with very tasty seasoning. If you're the vinegar person you'll love this appetizing savory noodles otherwise you may feel the vinegar a little overpowering, personally I like it - nice! Great ingredients combination with minced pork, pork liver, pork balls, wanton, dried fish, and also preserved vegetables that add more flavors into the taste. The soup served with seaweed and tasted equally good. Price at $6, $8 and $10$6 standard serving is "ladies size".... For men or big eater you should order $8 or $10 bowlI would definitely recommend this noodles but are you willing to wait for the food? ;

Was told that the queue here is crazy during peak hour (lunch time), so my boyfriend and I decided to come here around 10ish in order to avoid the peak hour queue. We estimated to spend 45 minutes queuing since the line was rather short but to our dismay, we ended up queuing for almost 3 hours for the michelin starred pork noodles.The noodles come in 3 different portion: $6, $8 and $10. We ordered the $10 but we were not sure what makes the difference because the noodles portion look the same for all. We were guessing it could be the additional ingredients such as minced pork, meat balls and the fried anchovies. I love pork noodles and I've tasted a few bak chor mee (pork noodles with vinegar) in Singapore prior to this and this one made it to my top 3 list. The noodles are springy and cooked well despite the amount of noodles they had to cook due to the high demand. The aromatic vinegar balances well throughout the whole dish (i love the taste of vinegar so some may beg to differ). I've tasted some that lacks the sourish flavour and aroma from the vinegar making it really bland. The noodles are garnished with a minced and sliced pork, lard and fried anchovies that gives a crunchy feel. The noodles also comes with seaweed soup which is not too bad.Other than noodles, they also sell a bowl of meat ball soup. We tried it and it's not bad at all. The meatballs are well cooked and has the springy taste to it. There were only 3 people working in the stall. 1 taking orders, 1 cooking and no sure about the third person. I guess that could be reason for the long queue - lack of manpower. All in all to me is a once off experience. If you don't mind queuing and have time to kill, go and try it. But please do not hog the tables while queuing
2
i came to this place with my family before, queue for 30min and we changed our mind not to wait anymore. today i came here again and had my noodles after 2-hour-queue. the taste is not as good as expected. i have eaten more delicious noodles somewhere else in singapore and no need to wait for this long. no pork lard flavor, quite salty to me. really a waste of time.
4
Not sure I fully understand the hype about this place. Sure the noodles where springy and cooked to perfection. The protein perfectly done, however the sauce as such didn't do it for me. I had to wait for an one hour on a Tuesday dinner time, so not too bad.
1
Pretty dirty place and overvalued food. We went there considering the michelin star, but it was really a deception. We stood in the queue for 1 hour and we only moved around one meter and a half... There are plenty of other restaurants in the street where you can find the same food at a better price
2
As usual, there was a huge line. We waited for over 1 hour to try the Michelin star dish. For sure, the dish has a very unique flavor. The pork is very good and tasty, but unfortunately, it has too much vinegar :( Extremely hot and chaotic mini-hawker center, but close enough to the arab district. I understand some people may try it just to say that they have eaten at one of the cheapest michelin restaurants in the world... other than that, I do not see the point of waiting to try it
5
Had lunch with the family last month at Tai Hwa and as usual the queue was super long even at 10.45am. We did not get our noddles till 12.30pm! Was it worth the wait?Well it's good!! Tasty, fresh ingredients, al dente noodles. Will be back but earlier so near the crowds!

Joined the queue at 11am. There was already a long queue. One guy collected the Bak Chor Mee told a tourist that he waited 2 hours and 15 minutes till he got his food. I don't really believe at first. When I finally saw the signboard I was only halfway in the queue. 2 hours later I got to order my Bak Chor Mee. But you need to wait another 15 minutes for your turn to prepare your food. Actually I was an old customer. I used to work near that area and I visit them almost everyday. Before Michelin Guide the queue is maximum 30 minutes. But now it's 2 hours and 15 minutes. Upon taking the first bite of the Bak Chor Mee, I'm disappointed. Overrated. Makes me feel Michelin Guide is so so only. The noodle quality has deteriorated over the year. I followed them for years. Even before the current location. Used to be much tastier but now it's only fanciful.Conclusion is not worth the wait and Michelin is overrated.
3
It took me 50 minutes to queue for the noodle. And I had high expectation of the quality. The pork noodle tasted alright but I guess it was not worth the wait. Once is quite enough.
4
I queued for more than an hour on my latest visit a few days ago. Not a good choice if you are hungry but the food is worth the wait, if you have time to spare.
1
I was quite disappointed at my first Hawker Center/Food Stall Michelin Star eatery. Strong pungent flavors which were completely unpleasant to me. As I say in the title fort review this could mean that this type of food just doesn't fit my flavor profile.
3
They opened at 0930AM. I purposely drove there at 0745AM just to get the queue number first. Gotten number 8, thought the wait shouldn't be long. However, the queue took 45 minutes for me to get my noodles. People in front ordered many bowls, so you gotta be lucky. Those without a queue number, just give it up. Its not worth the queue, not a Michelin 1 Star Standard. As a Singaporean, eaten at many stores before. Many would say, there are better ones elsewhere. Sushi Dai in Japan took 4 Hours to queue and I would say its worth the michelin bib gourmand. If Tai Hwa were to get only Michelin Bib Gourmand, it would make sense though. 1 Star and the queue is just overly exaggerated. Doubt many would return. Many cockroach are spotted around the coffeeshop, i swear, no joke. My Rating: 2.9 / 5

Went here on friday 6 PMTo grab dinner with some friendsThe queue is pretty longTake an hour to enjoy this Famous Bak Chor Mee (Mie Pork)We orderThe dry noodleSpicy and OriginalThe spicy one taste a bit sour I can taste the strong vinegarThe original Was amazingMy husband love it and finished it offIt cames with an amazing seaweed soupVery tasty!And also they have dried fish and pork liver on itWorth the wait

The queuing system is a bit confusing to start with. If you arrive before 9.30am (opening time), please go to the counter to get a queue number. Then when it opens for business, a staff on the right side of the stall (stall in front of you) will shout out the number and you go and place your order. But safer to be standing around the stall the moment it opens to avoid your number being missed. If you arrive either after it opened for business or after all the queue numbers have been issued out, you will have to start to queue on the left side of the stall (u face the stall). Don't queue at the right side if you do not have a queue number. So don't be surprised if you see people cutting queue in front of you. These people are those who had a queue number and had just finished placing their order on the right side queue. If the above all makes sense to you. It was confusing to us at first but thanks to some return customers, we learnt their queuing system. We arrived at 9am, our queue number was #12 and we waited for 1 hr for our noodles. The noodles where chewy and firm with loads of ingredients for a $8 bowl. Tasty if you like vinegar, if you don't ask for no or less vinegar. Overall a good meal but not convinced that is worth the wait.
4
Bottomline is that the noodles are really good - prepared with care and to order like in a excellent Italian Place.The dry noodles are perfectly all dente - a little chewy - with a sauce of blending black vinegar and their own special secret "red sauce" which is a little spicy, but well rounded - more to the like of a Thai red chilli jam. It is then topped with some shredded pork, minced pork, meatballs, dumplings, liver and a little crisp of deep fried fish. The "wet" version omits the red sauce and uses rice noodles and has some seaweed as well.There is also a dish of porkballs with broth and some scallions.The dry noodles are truly excellent, the others are very good. The quality of the egg noodles, dumplings, broth, a the special sauce and meatballs and the cooking technique is what sets this place apart.There is three sizes which are priced S$6, S$8 and S$10 - we shared.In the end though the off putting part is the insane wait times for this - all is prepared to order and takes 4-7 minutes per dish. This means that with just 20 people in front of you each ordering for 2-3 the wait time can easily be 2 hours.... If you look at it as a queue at universal studios and you are a foodie I'd definitely recommend - honestly though 2 hours for a bowl of really good noodles is a really long time..

I have been patronising them since 1990s when they were at Marina Square. All these years, the taste has been the same although it was the owner Tang Chay Seng who was preparing the noodle then but now, it is his assistant who is dishing out the yummy noodles.The queues are usually long and the wait is at least 40 minutes, if not much longer. They close on the 1st and 3rd Monday every month. The trick here is to go on a Monday (2nd or 4th) because many assume that the stall is closed. Alternatively pay a visit in the morning and get a queue number before 9.30am (when they commence serving). In this way, you are able to "manage" your waiting time better.The texture of the noodle is springy and the pork is just nice (not overcooked). It is the painstaking effort of ensuring the each bowl is consistent that could have contributed to their culinary recognition. Of course the vinegar helps to give THAT flavour and a generous serving of freshly prepared crispy pork lard. Since each bowl is prepared individually and in a similar manner, it therefore contributes to the long waiting time.Each bowl of noodle costs SGD6 or SGD8 or SGD10. In addition you can purchase an additional bowl of soup with mixed ingredients or pork balls. Since I have to queue so long every visit, I would order a SGD10 bowl to make my time more worthwhile.Of course for such a low price, this food is served in a non-airconditioned coffee shop. I only wish that the toilet is in better condition and cleaner. This, is the "weakest link". It is indeed a "no-brainer" for anyone to patronise this 1 star Michellin establishment as the cost is definite cheap for a 1 star Michellin eatery. The only other cost is an hour or two of your time
3
Finally the 4 of us decided to visit the stall this morning. Arrived at 9am and collected a early bird pre queue number of 25. Was really all hyped up and we could clearly see many other diners too. Was told there will be a minimum wait time of 120 mins from 930am.The estimate was rather accurate. By the time the noodles are all on the table, it was 1155am. I took my first bite into the noodles and i seriously felt upset, disappointed and almost stupid to have wasted all morning. Noodles were over cooked, vinegar over powered the balance of the dish and the liver was tough. Worked on it for few mins, each bite loses more and more appeal... meantime the strong odour in the coffee shop tells me it was all but a overall terrible decision to visit. I would say overall nothing to rave about.. we spent 8 bucks per bowl.. sat in the heat, inhaled the terrible stench...never again. I am very concerned with the rating and review system.

After hearing that this was the first street stall with a michelin star we had to try it. The food was really, really good. The signature pork noodles come with a combination of wonton, tender shredded pork, liver, and fish balls. Really interesting combination of flavors that is definitely worth a try. The price is also very affordable for such an acclaimed restaurant: the largest order size is only SGD 10, while the regular size is SGD 6.The line was pretty long (about 45 minutes wait at 7:00 pm on a Wednesday night), so be prepared to queue up for a while
1
The taste was really uneatable for 3 different dishes. Be careful. Not good clean. Huge line. Possibly it is good for local but not for us
3
The meat was tender and the noodles were good. The soup was ok. You might want to add more chilli if you prefer spicy.
4
The noodles here are cooked just right and tossed in a mixture of chilli, vinegar and stock. The accompanying dumplings and meatballs taste just great. The stall is located in a coffeeshop conveniently close to Lavender MRT Station.
1
Unfortunately we turned up and it was closed. No sign to say why or when it will open back up, not even a "closed" sign. Aprons thrown into the counter like they ran away.
Disappointed definitely.

I have been patronizing this restaurant for years, just like many other regular customers. There is no doubt that they make one of the best minced pork noodles in Singapore.But I only wished they can be a little more considerate in treating their aged customers.Somehow they refuse to allow customers that are weak to take a seat while waiting for the food.Twice I witnessed the owner and one of his staff calling out to a customer to get back into the que and not sit down.One was a senior woman and another was middle aged lady with serious arthritis problems.The owner has already made tons of money and well known because of Michelin rating. All I can wish is that they spare some thought for the weak and sick and not insist that they must stand in the que

One Michelin star dinner for less than $6 USD. I had the pork noodle dinner for $8 SGD, in hindsight I could have ordered the smaller $6 SGD version. Very flavorful and the three types of noodles and the sauce are a 'must try'. Get off the beaten path, stretch yourself (it's not a typical restaurant - it's old style Singapore hawker or food court) and try it

If you are into noodle, Chinese food or Michelin star awarded cuisine, u def must visit this quaint Coffeeshop offering the cheapest Michelin star awarded noodles in Singapore. The noodles are made just right, the vinegar is the best part of it, the inclusion of the fried dried fish is an interesting mix and the pork balls are all made, well, heavenly. Def a worthy winner. If u dun have time to queue (min 1 hour) or if noodles is not your thing, visit the stall next to it, Happy Chef, which serves great western food. Rated Singapore Best Food 2017 as well.

The store is a little ways out of the hustle and bustle of the City streets but worth the journey. The food is traditional and the star well deserved. We were fifth in line and just waited 20mins before we could order and another 5-10mins for our food to be ready (there were 3 of us). Food was amazing and loved the dishes we got
5
Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle is still real street food stall with star in the Michelin Guide they did not change their quality and customers.You need to wait (my case about 20 min) and English is not their strong side (I needed help of other customer). Go for "dry" version as I was told it is more clasical

@TheKuoKnowsThis is Singapore's other Michelin star hawker stall. It's claim to fame is Bak Chor Mee or Noodles with Mince Pork.The noodles are outstandingly good. The strands of gold are cooked to al dente perfection and tossed in just the right amount of spicy vinegar. But that's not all........ the choice of accompaniments are sublime. There is the traditional mince pork, which is de rigeur for any Bak Chor Mee. But there's more.Each slither of liver that graces the bowl is soft and every piece of pork is tender. The won tons are bursting at the seams with flavour.For most hawkers might be about as far as they would want to go. But not at Tai Hwa.Chef Tang has added texture to the dish with a sprinkling of deep-fried sole. Inspired!This is one place to put on your places to visit in Singapore. But be warned. The wait in line for food is infuriatingly long.Your only hope for faster service is that those in front of you might lose patience and leave.

I heard this is famous pork noodle,, so,, i am food lover and hunting this food,, long queue,, but worth it,, another hawker stall which get michelin stars,, one of singapore good food
3
The queue was pretty short when I dropped by. It was just a 15 minutes wait. Maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for 15-minutes lunch break soon at 2.30pm. I was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break.Orders that cannot be completed by 2.30pm would be given a queue number.The serving looked a tab small for S$10 and served with a bowl of seaweed soup. I was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor. The sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary. Like that the pig's liver was cooked just right - tender. There's lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it
4
Read a little about this place and since it was close to my hotel - give it a try. Went around 2:30pm, well after the lunch crowd I thought. Wrong! Still a 45-50 min wait and I'm not exactly sure why, not a ton of people in front of me but it moved slowly. Add the temp and I'm not sure it was worth the wait. Ordered the #3 dry pork noodle and I went all out on the $10 upgrade, added a seaweed soup and some dried fish flakes. The taste and flavor was good, definitely glad I went for the upgrade cause it wasn't huge but enough for a hungry post workout me, of course the seaweed soup helped! The dry fish flakes were money! I should have ordered a bowl of it. Was it worth the wait?? Depends on your personality and what else you have going on, for me, I wouldn't do it often and next time after 4pm! :
4
Went to Tai Hwa at 10:15. Queued for 1h 30min and finally got food. Balance between vinegar and Chilli was fine and the Soup was splendid. If you want a substantial meal order the $8 at least. Noodles wise, I ordered Kway Teow which is the best combo in my opinion. If you want to queue, better be prepared. Despite winning the Michelin star, its standards have dropped from last time when I ate it on a monthly basis. If you wish to avoid the queue, go to Hong Lim Hawker Centre for the alternative Tai Hwa ba Chor Mee. Queue is only 15-45mins. Food possibly not as good as it is quite inconsistent. Overall the queue is not worth the price and portion and quality of food. But still good :) for the quality alon
3
Be prepared to wait and, if you want the really famous one, order no. 3 - and go for the $10 size if you're hungry.We were here at 11am and waited 1.5 hours... I expected to wait bit but this queue moved very slowly and I'm ultimately not sure why as the chef was moving quickly?!We ordered a no. 2 soup noodle, no. 3 dry noodle in the delicious vinegar sauce and a pork ball soup. 3. and 5. were great but the soup noodle was a little overwhelmed by the liver in it.
5
This stall has been my all time favourite way before the Michelin star award. The ‘magic’ ingredients revealed: Al dente springy noodles tossed in a savoury vinegary sauce, filled with tender pork and liver slices, minced pork, dumplings, and a sprinkle of fried sole fish. The taste is simply magical! Price starts from S$5 and top at S$10 if you fancy a larger portion with more ingredients.Be prepared to stand in queue for at least 45 minutes or longer. You could plan to arrive early at 7.30 a.m to pick a queue number and stand in line at 9.30 a.m when operations start for a shorter wait.I am deterred by the crowds but I will be back for more.. that is when I could spare the time to stand in queue
5
Have been a regular to this place for a long time. However, over time the portions has gone smaller and smaller (I think they called it inflation). But the quality has been consistent for many years, the tanginess of the noodles, the freshness of the pork slices and balls, the fragrance of the vinegar and soya sauce, and the unique character of the soup (i can surely tell the liver, cabbages that goes with it!). No regrets except that I now have to upgrade my order to satisfy my cravings of have more of the best. A must try, and well deserved 1 Michelin star
4
Intrigued by the long queue, I finally joined in the fun to satisfy my curiosity. Had chosen $5 (cheapest) dried bak chor mee. Q for about 30-35 minutes from 2.20 pm to avoid lunch crowd. I don't think it worth the queue as it is expensive for such a small serving. But I would say the noodles and the soup are nice. I just want to find out why 1 Michelin star is given. There were still crowd streaming in by the time I was done. Will attempt to try the Western food next door in the same coffee shop which also has rave reviews
3
A local friend took me here for lunch - early at 10.20am as he suggested the Queue can be long. It seemed a simple hawker place like many I have visited in Singapore. I "chopped" the table while my friend stood in the Q. 57 mins later he returned with a tray full of food. Bak Chor Mee it was and upon looking and seeing the serving size ( smallish) and looking like most other Bak Chor Mee I have had.To be brutally honest - it simply is not worth spending that amount of time waiting for a dish that certainly is not Michelin Star really. Yes, it is quite nice, but I've been to places like 58 Minced Meat Noodle in Upper Changi or Ah Poh minced meat noodle in Bedok 85.Shop around I say
4
Michelin 1 star bak chor mee does not fail. Comes in a bowl packed w a punch - curly yellow noodles (mee poh), minced pork w other goodies (innards; be warned!) and a concoction of dark sauces w a heavy hint of vinegar - this iconic Singaporean dish surely leaves an impression. Just as famous as their noodles is their infamous queue,ours lasted for half an hour.
3
The noodles are tasty, but not really something out of this world. It is just not worth the amount of queuing.
I would personally recommend that you come earlier in the morning for the shortest queue.
4
We got there at around 5pm, took about 30 minutes wait until we got our bowl. Cost around 6$ Singapore money for there noodle dish. It's was ok, the sauce was vinegary maybe it's because I'd expected to be sweet.
4
Interesting place that serves noodles or soup and be prepared to queue. Rest easy though, the queue is not as long as it seems, but will probably take half an hour.Best priced beer we had in the city though (Bottle of Carlsberg 660ml)Has shared seating with other restaurants (No queues there)Nice enough experience that we'd never have done without the michelin interventio
4
Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle Now that it has received a Michelin star, there are more tourists but not many locals joining the queue, I went at 2pm on a Saturday and it still took about 45 minutes to wait in line for the food. There were about 12 people ahead of me. The queue system is worked on call person while on line. Halfway through the wait maybe 6-8 people ahead of you, you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait ,how clever , the downfall is the guy that takes the order speak very little English. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Total cost of $5 I got the Bak Chor Mee the noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't classify. Fineness, the dish was very appealing, with bites irregular between crunchy and soft as you ate. The vinegar was slightly overpowering. The side bowl of soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish. In conclusion it’s a street food that I would unquestionably recommend to my friends or any tourists to visit
4
After hearing about the star rating I had to give this place a try. Arrived relatively early (11am) to beat the rush as I've heard wait times can be long. Ended up waiting around 30-35 minutes. Really love the ba chor mee sauce. It was a flavor that was deliciously tangy, special and unique. Give it a go, but be aware, you'll be waiting a while
5
We actually walked to this place from our hotel. Easy to find, not that hidden in Crawford Lane. Bring tissues/napkins, try to get in early around 9AM to beat morning rush. Cash only. Broth wasn't salty and clear. Their noodles were not overcooked and yummy, try the #2 or #3. Personal favorite was #3 dry noodles with vinegar
5
The stall has been going in this family since 1936. They serve authentic Teochew noodles （乾麵 dry noodles) (although you can have inauthentic optional chili oil and chili added if you wish). They use vinegar and soy sauce (no tomato ketchup, which a lot of local places in Singapore use). The liver is blanched quickly so that it is cooked but still smooth (instead of hard). He puts a couple of slices of tee poh he (fried dried fish) on top, which is also rare nowadays. Have the seaweed soup (Zi Cai Tang 紫菜湯) as an accompaniment. I'm not so hot on the noodle soup: that's not what he does best.The queues at lunchtime are 1 to 2 hours long. If you go in the evening at 7 p.m. you can get served in under 30 min
1
Having been warned about long queues, we arrived after the lunch crowd (we hoped) at 2pm.Alas, there was still a very long line moving excruciatingly slowly. We had to STAND in line for 70 minutes.During this time we made friends with a local Singaporean family in front of us.He tried to place his order in English: No success.Then he tried the local Chinese dialect the majority speaks (Hokien): No success.Then another staff member came and translated yet into another dialect.My conclusion: The staff member taking the orders is FOB (Fresh Off the BOAT) from China.So after all these tribulations how was the food:Very mediocre and very average. The same level as any other hawker stall in Singapore at best (and I have patronised quite a few). It is a bit of a mystery for me how Michelin could award this star.Having lived for six years in Paris, and patronised many Michelin restaurants and read many Michelin guides, I know about the rules and expectations how they evaluate a restaurant.This one must have failed all.From the environment, cleanliness, attractiveness, presentation, staff uniforms, staff behacious, creativity of their cuisine etc etc.The pre-cut raw meat, waiting to be cooked, is stored in open bowls on shelves. And yes there ARE flies visiting.On the attached photo watch the cooks thumb in the bowl.The bathrooms adjacent to the restaurant are an experience by themselves, I will avoid describing in detail.When standing in line I observed how the used dishes, cutlery and chopstick are being cleaned:Submersed into plastic buckets, with the water never changed while we were there.I chose pre packed Bamboo chop sticks instead.Hopefully we will be OK tomorrow
4
Yes. After seeing a few blogs and shows about this, my friends and I went to the place to check the food. Yes, there was a long queue even if we went after lunch hours. Yes, lining up is worth it because it was better than what we've expected.
3
Singapore has no lack of local delicacies in its hawker centres and food court. Unless you are a huge fan of Bak Chor Mee or you are just excited about trying the one michelin star restaurant that you are willing to beat the heat to queue for at least an hour, you may have better luck trying other bakchormee in other parts of singapore that doesnt take as long as this. The ingredients were plentiful but with the price paid, it is merely justifiable. Having tasted it, I am contented with my bowl of bakchormee at a coffee shop nearby that takes less than 5 mins to come and at a price halved of this and still tastes equally fabulous
3
A bit disappointed as i love bak chor mee. Had to queue for 45 mins. Dry version is ok. The soup version was tasteless. Probably diluted the soup too much. The bak chor mee at the changi terminal 2 foodcourt is much better
3
Came along with my friends to try out this Michelin star rated hawker stall. It's good for the price you pay and you might be disappointed if you have high expectation due to its Michelin star rate.
2
Went to try this stall because it was awarded a Michelin Star recently. The noodle was okay-ish but to think that we waited more and an hour and a half, i guess i wouldn't return to this stall.
2
Was really excited for a bowl of good Bak chor mee but it was quite a let down. I didn't mind the one hour wait, but the taste just didn't work for me. The vinegarette in it was sour enough, and the noodle was slightly overcooked. I enjoyed the Bak chor mee at the terminal two foodcourt far more better than this one. Don't think I will come back again.

Pros:- the dry noodle taste nice. If you like noodle or want to try one of the best local food you come to the right place.- michellin star noodle shop.- its cheap. The most expensive one is 10sgd. But i think 6sgd is big enough already.- there are another neaby local food stall within same place like rujak, steak, milk tea that worth to tryCons: - nearly 2 hours wait to get my bowl of noodle. I wont do that again for the second time!- not much variety within menu they only sell dry noodle and noodle with soup- the noodle shop located at modest local food stall with no air con and no fancy decoration- the staff not really speak fluent english. But you can easily ask help from another local visitor if you have trouble.- the food preparation within the food booth is a bit messy. If you're someone who are strict with hygiene it might be a problem for you. During my trip they got cleanliness rating for "B"- prepare for cash. No credit card accepted here.- a bit far from nearest MRT station. Tips:- if you dont like spicy dont forget to tell the staff to make the noodle not spicy. - its best come early to avoid hungry crowd. They open 9am-9pm- bring along your friend. 3 people perhaps the best. 1 person looking for table to seat. Another 1 person order the noodle. The other 1 simply ordering another food from nearby stall to save your time and let you experience another great local food: rujak, steak, milk te
4
Found it quite easily using google maps.Small and as others say with a long wait - short queue but it moves very slowly. We waited 1 hour which on a saturday apparently isnt bad at all.I must say the flavours in the noodle dishes are outstanding. Rich and complex - lots of textures and very fresh noodles. No compromize on quality. Enjoyed it a lot
4
Delicious pork noodles with dumplings, liver and a very good broth. It's excellent hawker food and there's a reason it's been in business since the 1930s. With the Michelin star the wait is now an hour for lunch, but you can hardly blame the chef for that. If you're on vacation and have time and someone to chat with while waiting it's definitely worth it
4
I ate here only because it has a Michelin star. Their signature dish is the dry mince meat noodle. I had some trouble communicating to the counter man, as he spoke no English. The noodle come in 5 sizes - I had the $6 medium size. You can have it with or without hot sauce. I thought the noodles were good but not spectacular. The wait at 3 PM was only about 30 minutes. I would not have been happy if I had to wait much longer than that. So, if you are in the area and the wait is not too long, go ahead and try it but do not go out of your way to come here. The area between Bugis metro stop and this restaurant had some cute cafes and shops
3
High expectations greeted this place since we know that this is a Michelin starred hawker eatery in Singapore. Maybe it's us but we were quite disappointed with the food. Their dry pork noodles vis-a-vis other pork noodles was just at par with others we tried elsewhere in Singapore. We anticipated the taste of their pork noodles would blow our taste buds out but at the end found it quite ordinary
5
Went there early to try and catch dinner hopefully minus the line --- Nope, stood there for an hour before I got to the counter. The guy manning the counter looked exhausted and cranky, and looked sick and tired of us non-locals who obviously were just after trying a cheap michelin-star meal. Add to that the lack of understanding as I only spoke English, he just shrugged me away after I held up my index finger, said "1 order please", nodding while smiling at him the whole time. a minute and a half later, i get a huge bowl of bak chor mee, a mall bowl of broth, a pair of chopsticks, and some plastic condiment containers with some mysterious sauces. I sat a table and marvelled at my feat, i had in front of me, finally, this Michelin-star-rated meal. And boy was it glorious. If the line hadnt been good for another hour and I didnt have an appointment after, I would have lined up for seconds.So, cranky counter guy notwithstanding, it was good food. Not exactly cheap as it was 10 SGD for the big bowl, but its still in hawker range (very very far from restaurant price range) and altogether quite value for money for such a good, tasty, well-balanced noodle meal. I'll do it again the next time I'm in singapore
5
This is awesome. Besides the noodles it comes with sliced liver. Definitely worth coming for. I had the dry mince meat noodles with chili and I am very impressed.
4
The recent publicity from the Michelin award has resulted in an almost hour long waiting time for the queue. Noodle quality has maintained although portion size has 'shrunken' slightly.
3
Had some free time so went to check it out after all the Michelin hype, the queue was pretty okay at 4pm on a weekday but was a very long wait as the noodles are prepared quite slowly. Not too sure how the Michelin guide does its rating but compared to other Michelin starred restaurants, it's just very strange that they decided to award it a star. Is the food comparable to a Michelin starred restaurant such as Dabbous in London or Studio in Copenhagen, probably not. It's good noodles but not necessarily better than what you could find in many hawker centers in Singapore.
4
Since our hotel was near the area, so we decided to visit this famous pork noodle shop. We went there at 8 am to take queueing number and get number 6... Oops.. the shop just opened at 9.30 am hahhaa... so we stroll around that area and got back at 9.30 am, the queueing was very longgg. The noodles actually came in 4 portion, so you can choose whatever portion (small, medium, large and extra large)We tried the pork noodles, the noodles are with vinegar and chili sauce. For me is not too spicy enough, but the taste is quite good for hungry people like us who already wait for so long hah
4
I understand what the Michelin quality mark means in my own country; don't come here expecting glazes, gels and starched linen! This is a bit of a departure from what many people have come to understand from a one-star establishment. First, you don't have to book 6 months ahead, you can just turn up (folding chair and good book recommended, the queue can be traumatic by the sounds of it). Second, this is a real Asian hawker kitchen, warts and all, and you grab a plastic chair where you can. Look away if you are squeamish...Third, the food. The classic dish here is pork mince noodles, which come in two types and different sizes. As Hawker food goes, this is not cheap, but as Michelin food goes, this costs less than a basket of artisan bread and single-estate olive oil... There is an intriguing mystery about the food here. Chef adds small amounts from 4 different bowls of dark, brooding sauces, each one a family secret I suspect, at least one of which seems has been fermented for a long time. These give the dish a deeply complex, rich flavour that you cannot define. Is that the Michelin thing? Who knows. The noodles and pork (minced pork, sliced pork, sliced liver, wonton) are well-cooked but on their own not stand-out. The accompanying bowl of pork broth with dried seaweed was almost Japanese in style and an interesting contrast.Interesting new experience: a garnish of fried fish skeleton. I know, sounds weird but go with it, it's there to add texture.Overall, I'm glad I queued for an hour for this. It was tasty, but since I haven't eaten extensively at hawker stalls in Singapore I don't know if it can be bettered. It's becoming a must-do experience, and why not go if you have time (and can find the place...)

Like many others, I visited Tai Hwa Pork Noodles to see what Michalin Star quality hawker centre food is like. The intrigue is twofold: the star means it is expected to be of high quality and the fact that hawker centre stalls are untypical of the guide adds a certain curiosity.We (my wife and I) arrived at around quarter to twelve on a Saturday morning and expected to queue for around 2 hours given it was the peak time of the peak day. The queue itself actually looked reasonably short, but it moves very slowly. In the end we were waiting around 1 hour and 20-30 minutes which isn't bad compared to our expectation but would be a long time under normal circumstances.What perhaps says it all is that I have relatively little to say about the food. It was alright. I find it hard to put my finger on any wow factor or superlative quality. It was just alright. We had the mince meat noodle (which I think is the flagship dish) and a meatball soup. The noodle dish was a little on the acidic side as a number of reviews have highlighted but I didn't think that was a particular problem.I don't think there was anything wrong with the stall or the food, I just can't identify anything special about it. I live in Singapore and have eaten a fair number of hawker centre meals from a number of places and I felt this dish was not significantly greater than any of the others.My advice would be that it is alright but not worth queuing 1-2 hours for. There are plenty of other good hawker centre stalls out there
4
This is one of the only two Michelin Star hawker stalls in Singapore, the other being the Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken. The queue is a lot more manageable here, only about 15 min long if u show up at 11am, as the location is not as prominent. The noodle, on the other hand, is excellent with the right texture and flavour. The minced pork and liver are tender and the fish balls taste fresh. The noodles come in dry or soupy and either style is cooked to perfection! The only issue is the price, which is a bit on the higher side by local hawker food standard but still very affordable
3
I arrived at 9.. and got my food at 11..For me, the fragarance of this stall is awesome. But the taste is not that spectacular as what's on my mind.. and they changed the chef.. I ordered minched pork noodle size 8sgd.. not big enough for me.. maybe next time i will ordered sgd 10 size.. hahaha..
5
Very authentic street hawker food made right in front of you. Like other reviewers have indicated, prepare to wait! I got there around 3pm on Saturday. The line did not look that long. Probably 35-40 ppl. I expected 20-30min wait, but it took 1hr 5mins. So, prepare to queue for a long time. Is it worth the wait? Absolutely! Before this place (HK Soya Duck Noodles was temporarily closed) Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong was the least expensive Michelin 1* meal you could find. I got the minced meat noodles. A small size is 5SGD, normal is 8, and I got the large for 10SGD. Man did it deliver! I got my with chili (they ask) and also added of the Thai hot chilis. There are other food and drink vendors in the small hawker center, so perhaps one strategy would be to grab a table and order some appetizer food and drinks from other vendors while your party members alternate waiting in the queue. I was solo, so that was not an option. In 3 weeks I'll be back and hope to post a comparison of the HK Soya Duck Noodles the other 1* Michelin hawker stall.
5
Great food prepared just in front of you!The mix of flavors is very refined and intense, I have enjoyed a lot.I got lucky and "only" waited around 30 minutes (go there around 17:00, before people get out of work - waiting time can be up to 3 hours, the owner told me. This place was already busy before receiving it's Michelin star).Impossible for me to tell if is worth a Michelin star... But the quality and taste are worth the price. Definitely worth trying (maybe in some weeks the waiting time will go back to normal;)
5
The queue was about 30-40 mins long, because this place is very popular. The pork noodles were excellent and what I was hoping for.
4
1 of the few places where I will go for my Ba Chor Mee aka minced pork noodles craving fixed.. Take note they're closed on every first & third Monday of the month.
5
Queue takes 1,5h and poll will be taking more and more everyday. Take minced meat and soup this stuff is awesome.
5
Visited this stall way before they being awarded the Michelin Award. Love the Pork Meat Ball the most. You won't just order for $5 or $6 portion after queuing for so long... #ISnapIEatIPostIShitItAllOut
5
Quite near to MRT. Can be abit warm the environment old school coffee shop style. Queue can be as long as 10++ people if during peak hours. Came at 6.25pm and beat everyone to the q!
4
My favorite Bak Chor Mer place has taken a turn for worse. Unfortunately the Michelin Starla's made the queue from bad to worse. I used to wait about 30-45min but had to queue for about 1.5 hours last week.The downhill side is that the quality of food has gone down. The vinegar sauce has lost a bit of its tartness and was a bit so-so. Was better before. Although they still cook each bowl separately, the taste wasn't there. I've been eating here for years but fear the Michelin star will have spoilt it

It between authentic restaurant, located in a residential area, the restaurant will only system Minced meat meatball soup with two faces, four face price, different large and small, flavored pasta al dente, good appetizers with sour ingredients pork slices, pig Run, dried fish, cloud annexation and meatballs, adding seaweed soup, good enough!

I'll give them this much - the bak chor (minced pork) noodles taste good. But are they so good that one can overlook the poor service and high prices? Not for me. I used to work near Crawford Lane so I frequented the stall on several occasions during lunch because bak chor mee is my favourite local dish and theirs was clearly above average. At each visit, however, I experienced the staff's arrogance - they were brusque in taking orders and openly unhappy with customised requests - all for a bowl of bak chor mee which they already charged more than other stalls. I'm local enough to accept non-existent service when the food is good but I draw the line at having to put up with bad service and rudeness. The straw that broke the camel's back came in the form of an extra $1 charge when I requested a bit more noodles. That was 8 years ago so you can imagine how exorbitant that was, so I was put off - for good. I still enjoy good bak chor mee elsewhere. Now that it has won a 'star', I can't say I'm surprised as they have had a reputation but I hope they won't be the norm for future 'stars'

For the tourists:Yes, this is the hawker stall that was awarded one Michelin star this year!Tai Hwa has a couple of brothers. I can't keep track but there's always a couple of stalls around Singapore banking of the same family name. Stay away from those and come to this one as this is the original and only consistent one.Probably the best take on minced pork noodles in Singapore thanks to their unique mix of vinegar & sauce.Worth the experience of seeing what the Michelin-star fuss is all about if you're happy to wait at least 90 minutes in line (more likely > 2 hours as the lineups have only gotten longer since they won that star). Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to sweat uncontrollably while in line. After waiting that long in line, just order the most expensive bowl of minced pork noodles (dry). I've had it both with and without chili, both are just as good.For the locals:I've been going to Tai Hwa since their Marina Square days (yes, a long time ago). In the last couple of years I have been coming less frequently as I felt that ingredient quality had gone down though prices had gone up. Nevertheless, I reckon they're still the best in town. It's a shame that this place is suddenly going to have even longer lineups. I already had the timing down pat which was to get here by 10:00-10:30am and wait for ~30 minutes. I would never come just before lunch time as there would invariably be people in the queue getting takeaway for 10-15 colleagues. Now that lineups are probably going to be at least 90 minutes long, I don't think I will be coming back any time soon as even if they're the best minced pork noodles in town, they're still just minced pork noodles
5
Get here early. I visit once a year and always arrive late. By 1030 the queue is 40 mins long. The noodles are delicious. I always go for dry with chilli and go large. Last week was my birthday so I had the $10 bowl.I am not a great fan of liver, but the rest of the treasures in the bowl are delicious. The amount of vinegar is just right and the springy noodles are great. The bowl is full of flavour. If you don't like queuing, avoid it. There is a branch at changi airport terminal 2 departure, with no queue, but the flavour not quite the same. To justify the calories I often go for a 10km walk by the marina bay before heading to Crawford street for my feast. Enjoy

Best of the best. If you like pork noodles, nothing beats this. Like is long so be prepared to wait. Best time to come is breakfast!!

Portions are small and they start from $5 onwards. Due to their popularity, noodles are overpriced and the wait is super long. Ask for less vinegar as they serve their noodles with quite abit more vinegar compared to other places.

love the sour taste! diffrent kind of noodle. but always had long queque at meal time. try their soup also. tasty broth.. nyumm

My opinion of course...this is the best minced meat pork noodles in sg.Been eating this more than 10 years ago when it was at marina (their previous location) and now at crawford lane.Noodles are pricey (minimum medium bowl for an average guy) and the Q is LONG. Expect 20-30min queues unless you come at off peak times.In spite of all this, I never fail to have a bowl when I'm in the area.Has a bit more vinegar taste so maybe not for you if you're not so much into vinegar in your noodles

We queued up for the supposedly very yummy and famous Pork noodles for about 1.5 hours. Since we were too hungry, we ordered a chicken chop from the stall next door - Happy Chef To our surprise, our mushroom gravy chicken chop was so yummmyy. The portion was also very generous. We were so swept away with Happy Chef, we had to order again. This time we ordered Cordon Bleu- which was nothing like I've ever tasted. Ooo the skin was crispy and yet the meat inside is so tender. The oozing cheese just complemented the meat (and I can still remember how it taste like as I'm writing this). Highly highly recommended!! When it was finally out turn at Tai Hwa, we ordered both the dry and soup noodles. I thought the dry noodle had a tad too much vinegar which was quite overpowering. Instead, I prefer the soupy pork noodle - opt for the rice noodle which tasted quite freshly made. That said, if I could go back again, I would *hands down* skip the pork noodle and go straight for Happy Chef's Cordon Bleu!! I swear it is that yummyyyy! Until today, my sister and I are still talking about Happy Chef & the Cordon Bleu this is certainly I would go back to Singapore for

This stall needs no introduction in Singapore. The long queue is indicative of the quality of bak chor mee, but I feel it's not worth the long wait (30 mins if you're lucky). Tick it off your bucket list of Singapore hawker delights and move on.
5
There are lots of bak chor mee joints in Singapore which are all good but this must be the best of the best. The noodles are cooked perfectly not too soft and not too hard, somewhat al dente. And the sauce is super tasty, lots of black vinegar and flavor. Yes the waiting time borders on the insane (45min to 1 hour during lunch and dinner time) but trust me it is completely worth the wait. My advice go during 3-4pm when the waiting time is around 30mins. My must go to place to eat whenever im in Singapore.

Found this place as we were driving along the road. The long queue attracted our attention. As the queue was long, we decided to come back another day.The next day, we went to the stall.It opens at 9:30am. We decided to be there early and was at the coffeeshop at 9am. We ordered a drink from a counter and waited for the stall to open. As we did not know this stall is super duper famous, we thought since we were early, we will be able to beat a potential queue. But lo and behold, my husband noticed that there were pockets of customers who would walk to the stall and have some form of conversation. He went over and realized a queue number will be given. We were early but was given queue number 12. Sharing this so that interested customers will know that a queue number will be given to you if you are early. At 9;30am sharp, the stall was opened for business. Mysteriously, the customers before us, appeared. Apparently, queue number 12 is the last number. After which, customers will just need to appear and queue (not such how accurate this is because this was explained to my husband by the staff in a midst of busy period). Whatever the case, it was pretty orderly. Managed to get our food close to 10am. There will just be streams of customers appearing (tourists, locals, westerners, elderly). Verdict of the food?I ordered guitiao in soup. The soup was nice. I did not feel thirsty after that. Ingredients were fresh. I paid additional dollar to have three meatballs added into the noodles. Will I return to eat this? Yes, if the queue is not long. Not the cheapest pork noodles in Singapore but you pay for what you get

This stall has been around for decades and the recipe has not changed - pork slices, minced pork, liver, pork balls mixed in with lots of crispy lard and salted fish in a tangy chilli soy sauce paste with vinegar. The soup version is just as delicious. Note that the stall is closed on the first and third Mondays of every month. Best to go during non-peak hours like between 4-6 pm, otherwise be prepared to queue for 30-60 minutes. Each bowl priced at $5, $6, $8 or $10. Go for the higher priced if you've come a long way. Noodle portions are quite small so you won't feel full. It's in a hot coffee shop so best to sit at the tables outside.

This is one stall not to be missed if you are a bak chor mee fan. A bowl of their signature noodles consists of oodles of pork (sliced and minced), pork liver and pork dumplings. Its not cheap for a bowl but it does give one satisfaction. The pork laden dish mixed with right amount of chili and vinegar makes it comfort food for anytime of the day. Be warned queue is long and waiting time is atrocious. This gets worse on weekends and public holidays
4
This is the best pork noodle store in Singapore.
The noodle is nice, the pork balls, fresh pork and everything in it is nice.
The waiting time is horrible horrible horrible ! I once waited about an hour to buy 2 bowls of noodle !
5
We were recommended by the concierge of our hotel and it really is very good. The taste of everything mixed together is amazing. Long queue, but might be the best noodle I have ever tasted.
5
In love with it for the past 20 years. Any self-respecting fan of hawker food in Singapore would have tried this before.
5
Despite long queue, the food quality remains consistent over the years which is a big plus. Never disappoint but the dried version with vinegar tastes better than soup version.
5
the noodles taste superbbbbbb but. long queue but it's worth waiting. trust me......... highly recommended.............
5
Its always been so good despite the long Q but my recent visit was quite a dissapointment. I noticed that usually the chef will prepare live on the spot from cooking the noodles to the ingredients that makes it so SHIOK !My recent visit there 2 weeks ago, I realised that they pre cooked the most of the ingredients after cooking the noodles, they placed the pre cooked ingredients onto the noodles & that " LOST THE USUAL SHIOKNESS of the Bak Chor Mee . Hope they realised this & get back to basic just to cut Q time by .....???
3
Vinegar and the hard noodles set it apart. However, the queue is just way too long - 45 min at 2pm on a sat. The owner/chef needs to improve efficiency because he does 1 bowl of noodles every 5 min. That is really too long and unproductive.Someone should have a look at his biz and propose some re-engineering. Otherwise amazing noodles but is it worth 45 min of queue sweating - nop
5
Heard about this famous place from so many friends and finally decided to go for it ..... queueing always puts me off! So we arrived on Friday at 11:30am - not bad only about 10 persons long but it took 30 mins to get to the head of the line!Yes, I agree, this is one of the best bak chor mee I have tasted - everything was prepared and cooked to perfection - the slivers of liver were thinly sliced and still bouncy to the taste, the pork slices were also very thinly sliced and together with the mince, very easy to eat. And of course the vinegar concoction was perfect. Not fogetting to mention the seaweed soup was yummy too! Yes, this complex bowl (we ordered $8 version) of noodles was made with TLC and worth the queue!PS 2 stalls away had awesome chives & egg pancakes with vinegar - northern chinese style - excellent to
5
Well, what can I say, this is the one and only and the best Mee pork. The queuing time easily 30-60 minutes depends on the time of days. The flavors of vinegar is very strong and the portion is quite enough depending the price plan. The dried fish and pork liver is really fresh taste. Order also the wonton soup separately which I think is a good combination with the Mee Pork. You won't regret it

My first taste of this delectable dish was many years ago, introduced to me by my dad who similarly, found it delicious. Since then, each time I visited Singapore (at least once a month), I would be sure to head to Tai Hwa Pork Noodles to make my trip to Singapore worthwhile!I will agree with some that this dish is an acquired taste, but even if you don't think it's heavenly, at worse, you'll find it acceptable. For me, there's something magical about the combination of special vinegar mixed with their own concoction of sauces, which just presents such a unique flavour to the noodles.To be fair, I've not sampled this dish from any other vendor, so can't make any comparisons, but I'm quite content to join the long queues (as long as I have time), and devour what I think is one of the most unique pork noodles dish invented in Asia. Definitely worth a try - you might get hooked

I always make the effort to get to Crawford Lane when in SG.Timed it the last time I went at 1145 hrs, to clear 6 people in the line it took 40 mins, with 1-2 bowls being ordered per person. Expect much worse once you hit 1200 hrs and the line extends past the pillar. Not much to say regarding service as it is a hawker; they work quite slow, but I guess that is where the taste comes from as only 1 bowl is done at a time.I normally pick the standard configuration dry noodles, and no mods to the vinegar/ingredients. The smallest portion size comes with soup, but without the special seaweed stuff and remnants of boiled minced pork. This is when you need the SGD6 portion at the least, to get the soup which he boils overnight. Can't explain this in words, you'll have to try and draw your own conclusions.As others have said, the noodles are boiled just nice, and the rest of the porkball/minced pork/pork fat bits/dried crispy fish is good. The dried crispy fish is expensive stuff, but not to my liking so my family members usually 'stng' (steal) this from my bowl.The flavours present are quite strong, so some may not like this. Best not to takeaway as it doesnt do well in packaging. I have tried taking away and it does not taste the same, even after a short 10 min ride home. If they are busy, don't expect to take away the soup - they won't entertain your request.Worth a try if you are a BCM fan as there are countless choices around the island, but I would single this one out (so far) as one of my go-to places

I decided to visit this stall famous for its minced meat noodles because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews on tripadvisor. To my utter dismay, I would not even consider their noodles of average standard. Firstly, the flavours were badly handled. Too much vinegar (and I like my vinegar) overpowered the entire dish and the other flavours from the meat and oils were just quashed by the acidic vinegar. If you like vinegar and noodles alone, then maybe this is the dish for you. Secondly, the wanton they added was overly salty and came as a strange shock of salt packaged in a wanton skin. Thirdly, obvious exploiting their rather dubiously esteemed status as premier noodle hawkers, they sold their noodles at $5 per bowl for a normal serving. Bearing in mind the stall is situated at a corner in a neighbourhood (although near to the central part of SG), $5 for extremely good noodles still reeks of greedy unfairness. Here, $5 for terrible sub-par noodles is a rip-off, plain and simple. Please avoid this place and by no means make a pilgrimage down to Lavender to try these awful noodles like I did. It is NOT true that there aren't better minced meat noodles out there - in fact, your nearby neighbourhood stall probably makes better ones in my opinion

What else is better than a good, complete and delicious bowl of noddle, a bak chor mee, one of the popular Singapore dish, cooked by father and son partnering since 1980 (my own impression after seeing both of their similar faces - see the picture for yourself to verify). I know that I am walking into a rare good food stall that has been established since I was born. A picture of the 80s with father and son standing side by side displayed on the building pillar is also what you will also see when you order your own bowl of mee kia noddle. Their appearance has matured over decades but their doing is like how it was. No food will taste better than one that is prepared with passion, love and decades of dedication serving food to customers. The noddle serving is perfect and complete, a small portion of various ingredients from salted fish, fishball, liver etc. For a premium price $8 per bowl (out of four choices at $5, $6, $8, and $10), you will get a full satisfaction of having a best tasting and complete bak chor mee. I will count days until I come back again for my next serving, 1 bowl per week

Being somewhat food obsessed, I had to try this place out so headed from Lavendar MRT station and after a few false starts managed to find the hawker market. There's actually a shortcut via the government building directly opposite the MRT exit but difficult to describe b/c it snakes around.At any rate, a 10min along the street will get you there. As mentioned there will be a long queue, I waited 45 min with 12 people ahead of me. I ordered the medium (to make up for the long wait) mee pok and while it is tasty, I found the pork liver to be sliced so thinly I couldn't taste it. If you don't like pork liver you can ask that they hold it so there's not reason not to give a good tasty slice! I am not an expert in BCM but have had a few around the hawker market so the flavour of the sauce as well as the soup (with it's meaty cloud) was good and if you are a foodie worth searching out but would I go back? Probably not.On the plus side, there's a lovely old man selling iced coffee at his booth which faces the line up so that was quite refreshing. He has a list of other interesting looking cold drinks too if you're feeling adventurous

I'd known before making my way down to Lavender that Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall, with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in Singapore. I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here. Um sadly. Wasn't impressed. I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted. I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day. Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm

We happened to be at ICA and decided to pop by for the pork noodle. The queue was long and I was in the queue for about 30 minutes. At S$7 per bowl, we found it slightly on the pricey side. Tastewise is quite good. Definitely tastes better than most pork noodle stalls we have tried before
5
I hadn't been to tai hwa in a long time and I am again seriously surprised at how good the bowl of bak chor mee tasted - absolutely incredible heaven. combination of black vinegar, chilli, minced pork, pork liver, and al dente noodles make for a wonderful combination. Granted the queue is long - go with a big group and ask someone else to stand in line :)
5
This is my favourite place to have a BCM meal. No doubt it's expensive at $5 a bowl, and you'll have to queue for minimum 30 minutes, but it is all worth it. The noodles are cooked to perfection, the pork ingredients are fresh and the seasonings are da bomb. Have queued an hour for these noodles before and wouldn't hesitate to do it again
5
Simply the best bak chor Mee in Singapore. Noodles are always fresh, and springy, great sauce and the ingredients are always generous. Only downside is that everyone in Singapore knows how good these noodles are, and you'll have to endure a long wait in line before you get to enjoy this perfection..

Click here: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/08/tai-hwa-bak-chor-mee.html for full postAccording to Teochew Ah Pa, the price has gone up with inflation. Now the smallest bowl is $5 and we ordered 3 bowls of dry BCM, 2 Mee Kia and 1 Mee Pok. The queue is of course, very long as always.Alas, the much-awaited BCM came up and yes, it was the same old taste that we've had previously. It does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings, and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more.No pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us. My family love our BCM the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent. You can self service to more vinegar if you like.That said, we noted a problem this time round. Too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles. I did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time (or my memory must be failing......) But it could also be this distinctive taste or重口味 that keeps the business going so well after many years.Indeed, we got thirsty hours after the meal. But well, once-in-a-blue-moon bowl of comforting and satisfying Bak Chor Mee won't hurt too much. Visit http://dairycream.blogspot.sg for mor

What more is there to say: ieathawker, Makansutra both say it all. This is the best bak chor mee that you're likely to find in Singapore.
4
The best minced meat noodle in Singapore (For the dry version). Great for fans of vinegar but waiting time is consistently between 45-90 minutes throughout the day.
5
Good bak chor mee. $6, al dente noodles. Pork liver and crispy fish are the stars.
4
very nice mee pok. but at times the number two is cranky and don't cook well
5
Amazing bak chor mee! Rather heavy on the vinegar, so may not be for everyone, but definitely one of my personal faves!
5
My favourite bak chor mee in Singapore! No where else's taste quite like Tai Hwa! Two thumbs up!

I am an American expat now living in Singapore with a very strong haute cuisine background. My family are inveterate foodies, so I was raised on the best. I eat in many of the world's best restaurants regularly. I have also run several highly regarded restaurants in New York City. As a result, I make it a point to search out the best of the best wherever I am. Having lived here for over a year and half and eaten literally hundreds of noodle dishes at hawker stands and restaurants throughout Singapore, I now uncategorically exclaim the magnificence of Tai Hwa's chewy, orgasmic noodles and meat. Other reviewers have discussed specifics, so I will not reiterate, other than to say go, even if you have to crawl. I have waited as long as an hour and it is well worth it

As far as Teochew bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) goes, and as far as I’m concerned, this is the best around. Hill Street Tai Hwa nails this one on the money. Noodles cooked perfectly are chewy and supple, and the sauce (soy and vinegar) has great flavour. Everything’s cooked right, the spare parts (liver and other stuff) are not overcooked with intense flavour emanating in your mouth. The lean pork is tender and supple, easily munchable with tons of melding flavours of the sauces and tasty broth. I found myself slurping down the bowl while sweating profusely and not minding the fact that I looked like a middle aged kid sweating in anticipation from standing in front of a Candy Empire store.But be prepared for an insanely long wait as the most of the time there is a monster queue. Once you have arrived at the end of the queue and it’s your turn to order, enjoy the food as you are about to eat the best pork noodle in Singapore. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

The mee pok is done just right. Al dante. Springy, firm and yet cooked. Perfect. To justify the "regular price" of $5 a bowl (prices ranged from $4 to $6), there are slightly more ingredients per bowl than the average $3 garden variety bak chor mee found all over Singapore. The queue started around 11:30am when we were there. It grew till it went round the side of the eating house by 1pm. I love the mee pok texture but can't find the justification for the hefty $5 price tag. Will be back in a couple of years

As a tourist from the US who generally likes Asian noodle dishes I was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery on this website. And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1/4 mile NE of Raffles) that , in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down "bak chor mee" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile
