what a great day spent if you coming at night. basically the tree were filled with the lamp that will light on.

from far away its looks very nice fee like to go and we did.nice music and ligiting done here.from far its looks like heven.

With such a stunning location overlooking Super Tree Grove, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore skyline this has the potential to be a great venue. However the decor is tired and dated and the service very slow and unfriendly. A bit of a disappointment but I guess it’s worth the cover charge for the wonderful view
5
I went to the roof top for evening drinks - we wanted to go the restaurant but they were fully booked. The roof top was great - amazing view. Definitely need to book. I thought it was actually good value for money - we paid S$20 (about £10) for access which includes one drink. Definitely worth booking if you want to go at sunset. Ideal spot for a drinkie after the Gardens by the Bay evening 'show'

This place has a stunning view of Singapore at night, a perfect place to appreciate the beauty of the city. Been here a few times, sometimes it’s breezy and sometimes it can be the opposite. Whenever I have friends who are visiting Singapore for the first time, I usually bring them here. Great place for some drinks and chat.You pay $20 for the entrance per person and that includes a drink of your choice (white wine, red wine, beer etc)
5
This is a big attraction in Singapore....there aren’t any seats around the tree but if you get there early you can sit on the steps or on the small wall of the garden beds . Just a tip leave just before every one else does to beat the crowds
2
This is a real shame.A perfect venue, great views, a real international icon of Singapore and it’s largely awful.Menu is limited, quality and presentation of food is way below the required standard.It’s very expensive esp as there is a minimum spend of sgd80 per head.Tables too close together, and we dining as a couple had a family of 7 placed next to us.This could be an international attraction for Singapore, I would get some new owners in sharpish
3
The actual tree is now getting slightly tatty inside & would benefit from a refurb. We paid to go up & have a drink in the air con bar - really nice to sit with a drink & watch the views in the cool.The admission of I think $12 each gets you the view & a non alcoholic drink - not explained to us before going in, & the staff were fairly disinterested in us as we weren't eating.Having seen inside - but not eaten - I wouldn't rush to have a meal here until they've updated it a bit
4
My party were really looking forward to seeing the Bay of Trees which is right next to the gardens. They are interesting and are clearly being colonised by the local birds and wildlife. We stayed for the night time show, which is basically all the trees lighting up to music and goes on for about 20 minutes, but five minutes it gets a bit samey
1
The view is nice but the food, the staff and everything else is a scam. We had the worst dinner ever that i had in my life and the prices i can’t tell you... i’ sad that i didn’t took any pictures to show you ... :( i can cook better and belive me I’ m not a good cooker. I hope that somebody will read this review because it will save you some money, believe me .
1
The service is unhandy, you need to spend a minimum amount and the beef Waigu Main course was really not good as it was far from tender. Just close and give it to a new owner as location is great!
5
Excellent location, fantastic view, super great service ane delicious food. We can highly recommend this place. It is not cheap, but the quality of the food and the location compensates completely
5
For about 20 dollars I get a drink on top of the super tree, and watch the sun casting a brilliant yellow in the deep blue sky with the silhouette of Singapore Marina. It is just so mesmerizing. Not to be missed.
1
Over priced, cold food, a tasteless shadow of what a good plate should be. the 20 dollar entry price would have still been overpriced even if it included the whole meal...-yes! It was really that bad!
5
Unfortunately I visited just as a thunderstorm was passing through, and as a result, the cloud walk portion was closed for safety reasons. However, this entire "park" is spectacular to view on its own. I spent a few hrs walking about the trees taking amazing photos and meeting new people along the way. There was also the option to visit the cloud forest, which I did and HIGHLY recommend, as well as the garden and butterfly exhibit as well. This is an awesome family/group and even a solo activity as there is so much to do any see.
4
From the bar at the top of the tallest sky tree you do get a great view. It was very pleasant the evening we were up there but it is overpriced. I believe it is 20 dollars and you get one drink. Donâ€™t think of watching the nightly light displays. They are out of view from here
1
We went there for dinner and thought having it in one of the supertrees has to be a great experience.Unfortunately the Indochine does not fullfill this expectations at all.It would be such a great location but in fact it is very shabby and cold atmospheric.Expensive wine is served in cheap glasses and the food was not good at all - we sent half of it back.I would say that this is the perfect tourist trap, if you think of going there just do it for a drink at the roof-top bar, also operated by Indochine.Also not high-class but at least you have a great view over Singapore harbour
4
We had dinner here, just for the view. I liked the food, but my partner thought it was average. We ate inside, but there are outside tables as well. The lighted supertrees look just as cool from here as the ground, and this height you're above some of them, for a different view. However, for a less obstructed view, you really want to go to the rooftop (treetop) bar
5
I went with my friends for the early Christmas celebration, the experience is great and the food and service provided is above our expectation. The restaurant have prefect 360 degrees view, can see marina bay sands and Singapore Flyer clearly. The food is special and this is the first time I try the duck with pineapple source, and Bacan with Lychee inside.After our dinner we go down to the enjoy the light performance at 8.45pm. This is a perfect dinning experience with the perfect location at the heart of Singapore (MRT Bayfront) and the good Atmosphere (Can see Marina hotel and Singapore Flyer from bar and restaurant). Strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone. :
5
Coming bk to sg aft 8 yr in uk.I start searching n exploring local restaurant, pub, sightseeing etc etc.This is not as tall as mbs or altitude, nor is a clubbing place.But the $20 rooftop is a must visit to see all sg sight .for local or ppl that prefer the chilling feel.Restaurant below slight costly for local spending, 4pax plus drink and $600 for us.We order 4 main, 3 starter to share and some cocktails
5
Whoever designed these structures did such an amazing job! So beautiful and definitely worth a visit.
4
This is a 'bucket list' item that should be on your list. Fantastic place for dinner to take in the spectacular garden light show. Make sure you book for dinner and when it's dark of course.
4
I have seen the light show a couple of times now and always relaxing and enjoyable. My daughter loved it. I recommend this to all visitors to Singapore as part of your itinerary.
4
This place is all about the view! You pay $20 to go up to the top and that includes a "free" drink from a limited drink selection. After that the drinks are about $20 per drink. We got some bar snacks, which were good. But that is now why we went, we went for the specular view for the Marina Bay Sands and the whole Marina area. It was really breath taking. I would say go for your free drink and some great pictures then keep it moving

It was our first time to Singapore’s Garden by the Bay and so we decided to splash out and to have dinner during sunset in the expensive Supertree by Indochine restaurant at the top of the largest of all the man-made super trees in the park. We knew we would be assured of spectacular view towards the Singapore River and the city; towards the awe-inspiring Marina Bay Sands Hotel; and towards the sea where illuminated ships sat majestically in the habour and at the new cruise terminal.The restaurant itself was not much to look at. The table settings were quite nice, but the walls looked like a stage that was not properly dressed. I feel that a restaurant with a minimum cover charge of SGD $80++ (£45.00++) per head should rather more elegant, albeit the views outside are spectacular and there is a balcony surrounding the restaurant where we had pre-dinner drinks as the sun set, which is a lovely touch.The service was very attentive and the waitress was helpful in assisting us to order. We perhaps should have been a little less trusting, however, as her much praised choice of soft shell crabs was not much to write home about. The crabs were dry and the thick sauce they were served atop was really too rich and creamy.Our selection of starters for two people were really nice and consisted of several tasty bite-sized foods including Vietnamese rice paper wraps and spicy squid.A main course dish of lemongrass cod was very food. It was fresh, flaky and the taste was very good We did not have dessert, but instead took coffee upstairs on the outside rooftop bar where there was a lovely breeze, a romantic air and, once again, breathtaking views. It was a pleasant experience and the food was good, but I think the prices are rather reflective of the location and views rather than of the food. Although tasty, this was no Michelin-star restaurant
5
Amazing place to spend an hour or so, especially in the evening when the supertrees lighten up. It's a nice place to rest a bit especially if you were walking the entire day. Colorful, cheerful, spectacular setup. We loved the light show and on top of everything: it is free
5
rather than dine at the restaurant we just went to the rooftop bar about 9.30pm. Its a $20pp entry, but that also includes a house wine, spirit or beer.On the Wednesday night we went, the bar was quite empty so we were able to get some great views of the city from this bar on the roof of the tallest 'tree'It is worth spending $20 just for the views; the drink is a bonus. But they have a range of bar food available if you are hungry, and subsequent drinks are still reasonably priced for such a unique location. Highly recommended
2
Restaurant is located on the roof top of the tallest Super Tree. Nice view even at night. You can even walk outside in the narrow terrace, around the tower. Unfortunately the service level was a disapointment. Staff seemed stressed out and tired, service was slow, even though restaurant was not full. Food was below average, nothing special.
4
Went there to celebrate birthday with my partner. Nice ambience but not much of a view from the restaurant. Dishes from appetiser to the mains and dessert was good quality, fresh and flavourful. Good portion. However the service a little flawed but saved by the food. Went upstairs to the top/rooftop for a drink and the night view of the skyline is just amazing .
4
It was a very humid evening when the three of us (2 overseas guests) decided we needed to take a break after walking at the beautiful Gardens. Since this place was one of the recommended places to check out at the Gardens by the Bay, we headed there.The ground floor walkway was interestingly decorated with nice collections of art (?). Wonderful fragrant smell permeating the place enhanced the viewing experience.The elevator took us to the top (which was the restaurant level). A flight of stairs took us to the open bar above the restaurant. Lots of cozy seats spread out before us. We were fortunately able to grab a seat by the edge. The night view around us was mesmerizing. We could see the tree tops spread around us and we could enjoy the lights at Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer, and the iconic Marina Bay Sands overlooking us. It all felt a bit like a scene from Blade Runner. Seated high up in the SuperTree, we could enjoy a slight, refreshing breeze. Coupled with a cold drink, it was hard to leave the place.A definitely nice place to visit for a stopover drink to chill out, relax, etc. when one is visiting the Gardens by the Bay
5
Simply amazing. You will feel like in Avatar country. Go up and have a drink at Indochine and enjoy the view
5
This has stunning views from the top inside the supertrees. Food was amazing in taste and looks very appertising as well. Watching other meals come out, they too looked devine. Mid-high range in price, but for us well worth it!
5
Go and see these in the evening a must the music the lights Danes to are amazing the children would be enchanted by them all
5
Have a drink at the height!, it is a must I can say if you are finally in the garden, Amazing place amazing view !
2
Service was shocking, from no plates, then no utensils to serve with, then my main dish arrived 10 mins after everyone else’s, by which time my rice & vegetables were cold. All this with a minimum spend of $80 a head. They did give me my meal for free and a bottle of wine but we won’t be going again. (Maybe just for drinks
5
A friend who lives in Singapore booked this restaurant for us just the day before we went. I was amazed that we could get in at such short notice. The supertree is even more incredible at night and the food is beautiful and not too expensive. The staff were friendly and helpful. All in all this was an incredible way to spend a night in Singapore!
5
Five for the view, zero for the food. We went to eat in the restaurant. The service is mediocre and the food abysmal and expensive. Dessert of a magnum ice cream with a bit of sticky rice and a cube of mango is just emperors new clothes . However you can pay just $20 and go to the bar at the top and redeem your entrance against a drink. You can still enter the restaurant and go outside on the walkway around the super tree. The bar at the top offers stupendous views. We went at night and it was breathtakingly spectacular to sit and chill and take in the 360* view of the city. Definitely do not bother with the restaurant!
4
Different view of Marina Bay Sand and great top view of garden by the bay.The food is good as usual in Indochine restaurant but prices are really too expensive. we paid 100sgd for a light diner for 2.if you decide to eat at the restaurant, take a jacket, it is very col
2
The view is amazing, 5 stars! But the service could be better. The seatcovers weren't all taken off. Your first drink was included at the entrance. For the second one we had to ask and than we got only half a menu, without prices. No wifi, although it showed there was. But that was only for the restaurant they told us.
3
We booked dinner here on the recommendation of our hotel. There is a person at the bottom of the lift checking that you have a booking before you are allowed upstairs. When we arrived we were shown to our table, we were given menus but had to wait for more that 30 minutes to order drinks. The food was tasty and interesting, but not special. And there is a minimum spend, so beware if your order doesn't equal the minimum you will be charged the minimum, this happened to a couple seated next to us.The view is spectacular, and the old adage 'the better the view the worse the service' definitely applies, because we struggled to get any attention while we were there. That is until the restaurant manager noticed the lack of attention being given to us.It is also possible to have a table on the terrace
5
Its is Super Tree in real planning sense. While the lights etc, make them look beautiful, what touched me is the way they are planned. The funnel top is the source of water collection for the Garden.
1
Great view but:
- waitresses not very pleasant
- very disapponting wine
- no free glass of water for my child
- over priced
- tables super closed to each other
Strongly not recommended
5
Good venue thats not super expensive with views of the amazing Marina Bay at nighttime the trees light up and it looks like something out of the Avatar movie.
4
We arrived to be greeted by an enthusiastic young man at the base of the Supertree, $20 ea got us to the top of the tree and a drink, wine of any type is expensive in Singapore so it was only a $4 entry fee, we sat atop the tree taking in the views and then decided to stay for lunch, we were greeted by the smiling staff and taken to our table, wow what a view, it was a real experience, we then chose from the extensive menu, yes a little pricy but look where we are! Our starters were fantastic and timely, ok there were only about 10 people in the restaurant but still they came quickly and were good value, our mains soon followed, Char Grilled Squid & US Bred Pork Loin, great presentation and very filling, the wine was expensive, not sure why Singapore needs to gouge the prices of wine hmmm! Anyways we enjoyed our experience, you take it for what it is rather than what you want it to be and you will enjoy the atmosphere and food. Overall a great afternoon but yes a bit pricy

This is the second review I have done for the Indochine. I have thoroughly enjoyed both times I went for the dinner.The view is spectacular, the service is excellent and the food is unique, so well presented and tastes beautiful. It is very well priced for an upmarket restaurant. An example is the starter dish in the photo of lychee and pork presented in the spoons. There are 6 good sized portions and this dish cost $28.00.The image with the 8 portion dish with the dish of sauce is also a starter dish of Goi Cuon Prawns and that cost $21.00.The two main dishes are pork loins which was $34.00 and the other one is smoked duck which cost $37.00.The alcohol is expensive which is normal for Singapore. An example was a gin and tonic at $21.00.The experience is well worth it and make sure you go up to the roof top bar after your meal to take in the 360 degree view of the city
2
As long as you’re aware that you normally need to go the bar to ask for service (but you can’t order for everyone in your party, because you all have individual tokens on your wristbands), that the wine is horrible, tonic flat, and the rum weak, you won’t be surprised. I’ve known all this for a while but I take guests there for the breathtaking view. What did surprise me on my last visit though was that when we asked for some water with our drinks order we were informed that did not serve it, or at least, not tap water, and that a bottle of water is $15. The place is ridiculous, and if it wasn’t for the view it would have failed as a business long ago
4
Great 360 degrees view to enjoy a cocktail or beer. Entry fee with one accompanying drink. I recommend going at night, with beautiful night lights of the city skyline and the amazing super trees looking like something out of the Avatar movie,will take your breath away. We did not eat, so I can't rate the food tough
2
A unique experience, but could be so much better!! Lovey view with good (not great) service. We ordered a variety of foods, but it was really not very tasty. The food was not great at all.I wouldn't recommend this place for a meal, just drinks.
2
Compared to the rest of the area and Singapore in general this bar was run down and about 2 star rating. The free wine oyu get with the entrance fee to the roof top bar was really quite ordinary. The place looks like it is run pretty badly compared to the rest of the Supertree facility. Only g0 for the view
2
First the good. It's situated on the top of the tallest of the amazing artificial 'trees' at Gardens on the Bay. So it's a wonderful spot and affords great views of the gardens and of Singapore.It costs 20 $ to go up to the bar and for that you get one drink (small beer, small wine or single spirit with mixer. So far so good.The staff however are less than friendly and there seems little motivation to serve you at all. The music is one of the worst pieces of elevator music you have ever heard with some woman simply destroying as many well known favourite tunes as it is possible to cram into a CD. We were enjoying our drink and had time to kill before the light show so we decided to order a second drink. That was an achievement since it involved engaging the staff who seemed pretty uninterested in serving us or anyone else for that matter. Amazingly the second drink turned out to be 10% more expensive than the one we paid for as part of our entrance to the bar! It would have been cheaper to travel down in the lift and simply buy a second wristband!Shame rally as this should be one of the great places to enjoy a drink in SP but the shine is taken off it by poor management that obviously does not value the customer experience for highl
5
Visited the restaurant, very nice ambience and staff who takes care of us. We could go up to the rooftop and take pictures and come back down to have our meal. Remember to reserve beforehand as they might reject those who do not have reservations.
5
The supertree has the wow factor at your first sight. Best time to visit is after sunset for you to see how gorgeous these trees were.
3
the sight from up top is nice, but the food is disappointing and the price tag quite high given the quality. won't recommend
5
this is a very nice bar in the clouds. you can see all around Singapore from here. and you can get drinks. good place.
5
Been up to the rooftop bar twice and it is an absolutely relaxing place to sip on some wine while admiring the beauty of Singapore. It has an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands and Garden by the Bay. $20 entrance fees also includes a drink. Perfect for chilling with friends or family.
5
We made a booking, whilst visiting the SuperTrees earlier that day, for 8pm after the 7.45pm light show.The menu had many delicious options but due to my special dietary requirements it was very limited. But this wasn't a problem for Yen the Manager on duty the night we visited. She was sooooo accommodating and ensured we had a beautiful meal - which we did.Produce was certainly very fresh and cooked with much care and the flavours AMAZING!The views are delightful too from the dining room. After dinner we went up to the rooftop bar and were mesmerized by the glorious views from this vantage point enjoying the balmy evening and full moon
3
Our group of four made dinner reservations for 7PM and when we arrived, we were shooed away at the entrance before we could even utter a word. When I said I had a reservation, the stony faced attendant moved aside and let us pass. One gets the impression they have no problems filling the restaurant due to its location on the highest supertree and also from the prices they were charging for the food (our bill was SGD500 with no alcoholic beverages).I was taken aback by how much wear and tear there was in the elevator and common areas. The washroom was equally in need of attention. Pros are the views, although the light show is better from the ground. We watched the 745PM show from ontop and caught the 845PM show after our dinner, lying flat on the ground. The atmosphere on the ground was better too, with people dancing, chatting and generally enjoying a spectacular show. The place is also wheelchair accessible as my mum was having knee problems.Average at best
4
We combined the opportunity to Dine in the SuperTree, view the tree sculptures and gardens and watch the evening light shows. There is one at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. The view is excellent and the food selection is good but could have been warmer. A bit hit and miss. We were expecting something special for the prices and location but beside the view wouldn,t say the dining experience was anything specia
5
Do not put yourself through it if you are scared of heights.Around 19:45 a show happens with lights and music it's great. The view from the top is unbeatable and the atmosphere in the evening is lovely.There's loads of places for dinner near by. We went early evening and waited to go to up when the show started it's a great experience. Highly recommend a visit
4
We had been advised that this was the place to go to watch the sunset. The price was 12 Singapore dollars each which included a drink ( tea and coffee being on offer ..... this was not actually what we were told on reaching the bar upstairs but a lovely lady in the restaurant brought me one up anyway. ) It is more than worth it as the views over the city are wonderful and it was great to relax and watch the sunset. We had no problem going up, we just arrived nice and early and chose where we wanted to sit. A great experience
4
I was there for one drink and the view was just amazing.
You can observe all the gardens and observe the Marina Bay Sands
I recommend to go there for sunset
5
Lovely food and one of the best views in Singapore, I'd say.
I highly enjoyed my visit here. We stumbled across this place by accident and I am so glad we did!
Food was amazing, drinks delicious. Wonderful views.
3
In my opinion better then the skywalk but still it is an expensive visit: 12SGD for a refreshing non alcoholic drink. The 360view on top is perfect!
4
Well worth going up and walking along the skywalk. Fantastic views of the entire gardens and areas surrounding the gardens.
3
We were told by the travel agency that it was hard to get a reservation here but we had no problem. We went during the night to enjoy the lightshow at the SuperTrees and then we went into the restaurant by IndoChine there in Gardens by the Bay. The food was OK but the location of the restaurant makes it very expensive and the value is not that good. The service was also OK, nothing great. I guess that if you are at Singapure for something special like us (we were there for our honeymoon) then it is a good idea to give yourselves this treat. If you are a backpacker or simply traveling on your own or family, I would look for other places to have dinner.By the way, it was very humid and hot outside but inside it was FREEZER. My wife always carries something to cover herself but I was feeling very cold by the end of the night
4
The views from the rooftop of the super tree structure over the gardens and far beyond are an absolute botanical delight. $12 gets you roof top access with entry via a lift then one flight of stairs and includes a soft drink in the restaurant. Unfortunately the rooftop bar area, outdoor seating and access staircase take some of the shine off, they are very tired and need an update. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals of Calamari and Chilli Beef Salad, if you ask for hot they most certainly deliver
4
Great view and location to sit and have a cold drink. I gave a 4 because we ordered some food, chicken wings and chips. The chicken was delicious but the chips were very over cooked very crunchy. The people at the table beside us didn't eat theirs as theirs were over cooked to. Other than that it was a great place visit. Thanks
4
We went to the light show at 7.30 pm (there's 2 each night, the second is at 8.30). The show only ran for 10 minutes but was really good. It was very crowded and getting back to Marina Sands (the nearest MRT) meant queuing up for 10 minutes just to walk up some stairs. The footbridge had so many people on it that it swayed! Anyway - worth a visit
3
It's a group lunch of 10 of us. The place is empty and the staff are tired, so perfunctory greetings, without smiles and warnth! The food was well presented and just ok but everything took a long time. We were chasing for desserts. It turned out to be an overcast day which made it perfect for taking photos on roof deck. No staff were present so other guests helped with that. I've never rushed to this place as I find the doncept of these supertrees an insult to the rest of the wondrous nature to be found in Gardens by the Bay
5
Finally managed to have dinner at SuperTree. Expectations were high as IndoChine have never disappointed in other locations, but given the gimmicky environment we were a little tentative.Turns out we had nothing to worry about. The environment is great, with a wonderful view of Singapore. The dining experience is pleasant as all the seating is around the centre so it feels much more intimate than a normal dining room.Staff were attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.Definitely have a pre-dinner drink at the rook top bar.We enjoyed oysters, seafood & chicken spring rolls as starters, then shared garlic & pepper beef, duck drumlets and Asian siu pak choy for main. All fantastic and what you would expect for the IndoChine crew.Great night, well worth going and a great experience.Will definitely be going back
4
We ate there as part of our trip to the Supertree Grove - something you have to do at least once. You can sit outside as well which looked fun but we chose to eat inside.
5
The rooftop restaurant has picturesque view of Singapore, although its only the bar & serve alcohol & some basic snacks.
5
There are some package which is cheap and allow you to have a drink in the supertree.
You can enjoy the high-rise view on the supertree, with the cheapest entrance fee (S10)
1
If you really want the view... Pay to be able to get to the roof top... But please don't eat there....
Slow service....
Over priced food...
Short options of drinks...
3
The sun faded rooftop bar. The lackadaisical rooftop bar staff, the missing cushions should have forewarned us not to eat in the Indochine Restaurant in the Supertree. A second warning could have been the lack of toilet paper!But we persevered. The dust on the glasses & in my serving bowl & the dated furnishings were saved by the friendliness of the head waitress. The food was nothing to complain about or gush about. However the lack of consideration to the light show below was appalling. Quieten your cover bar music & dim your lights- we are here to see the light show that has accompanied music. I was envious of the smart people who had their picnic rugs & could enjoy the show from the best vantage point- the ground!Save your money. Take a picnic & enjoy the light show from the grass.
3
The food is stunning, don't get me wrong, I cannot fault how delicious the meal was... but the cost is expensive, and for such an expensive meal I would expect faultless service... which is not what we received. We started by ordering 4 cocktails, which took a rather long time to arrive, and then the waitress quickly came back to take the drinks away again because they had forgotten to put the gin in, it then took another 10 minutes before the cocktails were brought back to us. The food was great, but then the waitress came to ask if we wanted dessert when only 3 of us had finished eating our main course and one was still eating, I found it awkward that I had to ask her to wait for my father to finish his meal before we would decide about whether we wanted dessert. They say that this restaurant offers 'the best view of the gardens', well I beg to differ, the view is obstructed by the metal frame of the supertree, the view is much better from the walking platform between supertrees, or even just from the ground walking around the supertree grove, i found the view to be a massive disappointment, especially as that was one of the main reasons we booked to eat here. So, in summary, the food is great but expensive, and the service we received was lower than I would expect when paying this price, you can get just as good and better service for a similar price but with much better views at places like Equinox or Level 33, so unfortunately I will not be going back

Everything about this establishment is crying out for attention. From the moment you step out of the lift and walk up the dirty, stained stairs to the rooftop bar, to trying to get the bill at the end of our night! We had made a booking for dinner so didn't need to 'pay' for the privilege of going to the rooftop first. The bar is not special, the seats are covered in mildew, cushions are missing, plants are not cared for and half dead. ( which is amazing when you are in the middle of gardens by the bay ) Staff apathetic and disinterested, cocktails ordinary and weak. But the view is amazing, so I can't understand why this venue isn't kept in top notch condition and the staff strained to give excellent service!! Next down at the restaurant it was even worse. Dusty glasses hanging up in the bar, no toilet paper in the only female/disabled toilet, plastic plants, dirty bowls for our soup and decor that was a total mismatch of patterns, colours and kitch. I am in the hospitality industry and the ma agent of this place need a major shack up. The food was ok but very ordinary the final straw was when the light show started outside, you couldn't see it from inside because of all the interior gaudy lights reflecting off the glass. We went outside and the music from the show was drowned out by the piped pop music in the restaurant!! People come to this venue for the supertree lights! We decided to just get out of there but even paying the bill was problematic, no staff around who could help. We spoke to someone regarding all our concerns so I hope that she does pass it on and the Indochine group take heed. Singapore has a reputation for cleanliness, excellent service and incredible food. Supertree by Indochine failed in all three.
3
A bit disappointed with this restaurant. The service was slow and the staff seemed inexperienced. We were asked several times if we wanted bottled water and it became tedious having to keep refusing. Tap water is cheaper! We waited 20 minutes for our Singapore Slings and when they arrived they were immediately taken away again because they had forgotten to put the gin in them. I suppose at least they realised and rectified the mistake. The food was only ok and the view was slightly obscured due to the structure on the outside of the restaurant. We got a better view from Equinox

Prenium location, very nice view and therefore expensive ( heavy bill!) But is the quality good? I took the duck breast and it was amazing! We took the tasting platter for 4 and it was average, the wine was good. service was good but very few people on a Tuesday evening.Areas to watch no one advised us of the timing of the starter with the tree show, for a 85SGD starter 6 min wouls have made a huge difference on the arrival of the food versus the 10min show so food was cold, no exscuse for a good and empty restaurant. The scallops were average but fresh :-)The bottle of water was 15 SGD!!CRAZY!!!The perfectly cooked duck with amazing sauce and good service saved the day but still not sure I would go back or recommend at this stage since you can have the view in other places and just too expensive for what it was! Tourist trap is to strong but somewhat true.Be

We decided to go after walking past when doing do Gardens by the Bay. We book for 7pm which was a good time as it gave just some time at the rooftop bar to have a drink first and watch the sunset.The view is good, but is obstructed by the super structure. The roof top bar is better.We liked the food and expected the price we paid. I would recommend it for people to experience. BY the time we finished dinner and paid, the light show down stairs was about the start, which was a bonus that we did not expect
3
with a complementary drink to talk in the amazing views, it is worth the money even for 20-30 minutes
5
We came here for lunch and had a wonderful time.
Food to me was a fusion of cultures.
Tip:
1. After lunch, ask if you can go to the rooftop for a nice 360 degree view of the gardens
5
I went to day time on the top which provided a clear view of entire Garden and another round during evening 8:00 PM to see the Music and Lighting show
2
I was very disappointed by this restaurant. Although known for its incredible and unique view - which is breathtaking - the staff and the service made this place not worth visiting. We booked a table at 8pm, and were "welcomed" by very impolite staff that told us that the reservation was at 9pm (?!?). So we went at the bar upstairs to get a drink, and our experience was again terrible, as the staff was unprepared and arrogant. We waited 30 minutes for the drinks, and as we went back downstairs for the restaurant we had to wait again. We were expecting a nice experience of fine dining, and instead were badly surprised by a low-quality service. Honestly, even considering the impressive view, the prices are so high and the service is so low that this is a no-go place for me.

While a gorgeous place to watch the sunset, sunrise, or the Singapore skyline at any time of day, it is $20SGD/person and includes a drink with your access to the SuperTree. We were a bit taken aback by the food minimum of $80/person to eat so opted for just the drink as due to the overall inattention to detail of the staff, seemed like those dollars would be much better spent elsewhere
5
We have visited many rooftop bars in Singapore, but this would have to be one of the best views. It costs S$20 to go up which includes a glass of beer, wine or spirits. If you are not having alcohol, it's S$12.Well worth it. We spent about an hour there, before it got busy. You can order food as well.Add on a walk around the gardens, that's a great place as well

During our evening visit to the Gardens By The Bay, we went up the supertree only for the view.Entrance was 20 SGD (apx. 14US$) and included a drink.There was a quick lift that took us to the top floor of the restaurant, but if you wanted to go to the top of the supertree for the bar, you had to climb a couple of dozens of stairs.While the drinks were ok, the bar at the top of the supertree was just average, as all the seats were soaked in water.However, the views from the top of the supertree were to die for - the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the skyline of Singapore, the Singapore Flyer, and ofcourse the supertrees and domes of the gardens.This is THE place for photo-ops, day or night.Highly recommended

The first major service blip was our drinks order. Two of us had ordered a vodka lime each, and another two had ordered a whiskey coke each. When the drinks arrived, the waiter announced "2 whiskey cokes, and 2 gin & tonics". When we clarified that we had ordered vodka limes and not gin & tonics, he said he would double check, and returned to us declaring our drinks "vodka limes". One sip and... they were gin & tonics indeed. Thinking that to be a genuine error, rather than a shoddy cover up for a mix up, we decided to let it pass and did not pursue it then. The second issue was really quite laughable. Having selected a slice of matcha cheesecake as dessert, one of us had stepped aside to inform the waitress that it was a birthday celebration, and if a candle could be provided along with the dessert. (See photo) Happy birthday... Candle? The greatest irony was that the waiter actually realised that it was a mistake, and looked sheepish as he set it down on our table, and proceeded to scamper off immediately as if to avoid us noticing. We called him back to clarify the situation and he admitted that it was a mistake. At this point, we found it extremely unbecoming, that a MISTAKE was knowingly served to guests. We can only guess that there were probably multiple stages of miscommunication between the first wait staff who took the message from us, the person who prepared the dessert, and the last person to actually serve it to our table. And that if a mistake was genuine, perhaps a word of clarification or apology could be offered to the guests in advance, and we could have just laughed off the whole incident. After sending it back, we had the word "candle" unceremoniously erased from the plate, and the same dish re-served to us, except with the scoop of chocolate ice-cream half melted by this time. Oh dear. The views were beautiful, but the entire experience was terrible, I wouldn't recommend this place for any important occasions or guests. It was frankly, an embarrassment

go early and catch the sun setting through the towers of the sands casino. amazing views of the singapore flyer lighting up for the night as well. plenty of seating and great place to take photos too. lots of tapas to choose from if you feel like something to eat

We went to the rooftop bar after a theatre trip at the recommendation of a colleague. No mention of the $20 entry fee beforehand as this might have deterred us. We are not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but to pay $20 dollars for a 'free' drink (incidentally, if you pay $20, it's not free....) and then have bad service when there are more staff than customers, is not acceptable. Trying to order a second round of drinks, and subsequently some truffle fries, was like pulling teeth, and we were definitely made to feel like we were an inconvenience. The most attentive service was when the waiter came to tell us it was last orders, followed by his relief that we did not want anything else so he could get closed up and go home. Such a shame that this place seems to be all about the location and nothing about the service. I found it difficult to score this one as the company I was in was exceptional together with the views (as seem to be the main comments from others), but the overall experience was not a good one and I felt that this needed to be reflected in my final ratin
1
Very bad was there at 16:00. Lamb chops and & beignets. And Mok Pa. The meat was a 6. The beignets. Soft greezy. Mok Pa was a pie with 2 schrimp. And 2 scallop build in a tower
4
you should definitely catch the light show at night. It happens at 7: 45 and 8: 45 every day (please do confirm timing on their website). Its a beautiful and peaceful site in the mornings as well. Definitely worth a visit.

The SuperTree by IndoChine is located in Marina Gardens Drive | Gardens by the Bay #03-01, Singapore. Location was great, particularly drinks at sunset, having dinner and emerging to the lit-up trees. food also good.
5
amazing spot for the 'blue hour'-watch the sunset behind the skyline of Marina Sands and whole Singapore with nice food and cocktails

My wife and I had been here once on a business meal, and had quite enjoyed it, despite the price being relatively high. This can be understood given the location and uniqueness of the restaurant.We went back as a family of 4 with our 2 children (aged below 10), on a relatively quiet evening despite it being Mother's Day.The $80 minimum spending per adult (and child over 12 years old) is just something to be conscious of, which was fine as we were out for a good meal on this rare occasion.We were generally content with the food and portions, enjoyed the view as always, but the service faults became so long that I had to pull out my phone to note them down...:- there was nobody to welcome us when we came out of the lift (15th floor), so we wandered in and none of the staff seemed to bothered to attend to us- the one who eventually checked us in with our reservation showed us to the only table that wasn't set yet, and was full of crumbs. 80% of tables were empty, so I just asked if we could sit at one of the other ones, which she sort of agreed to, unfazed.- starters arrived without us waiting too much, but as I was eating my soup with my right hand, the waitress bumped my elbow without even noticing, as she was clumsily passing between our table and that of our neighbours- I believe it was her who then brought us desserts that weren't ours when they had just cleared our starters- we were later brought mains that weren't ours, and ended up waiting for about 50 minutes from having ordered to get our main- so we ended up only using one waitress for our later orders. Not particularly friendly, but reliableThe food is quite focused on seafood and was generally alright, with hits and misses:- my soup was hardly warm- the brown rice was room temperature and blandIn the end, we ordered well more than the minimal spend required, and thought we could have had 2 excellent dinners for the price of this one in other nice places. It was still an overall enjoyable evening given the occasion and company though...So all in all, our children are now happy to know what is up in the Supertrees of the Gardens by the Bay, but we won't be coming back anytime soon
1
What started off as a wonderful first day in Singapore was swiftly ruined by the bar staff demanding we settled our bill (whilst we were still drinking) in order to free up space. Considering we had ordered starters and a few cocktails each it came as a little surprise. As I write this there are still about half of the seats free and most people haven't ordered anything in addition to their drink included in their entry ticket. Disappointed with this seemingly nonsensical and unfriendly reaction to well-paid customers.
5
You'll have to see it on your way to view the two themes at gardens by the bay and they do look very nice but make sure to go back and view them during night time because that is when they look the prettiest all lit up and amazin
5
The best point to get a view of the bay along with great food. Be there before sunset and you have an opportunity for great photographs. Unfortunately didnt carry my camera. Have some drinks in the open air area and the go a level down for some great food

In a city where eating out at a decent restaurant can be very expensive, the food here was very reasonably priced and tasty. We were a little put off having to pay a cover charge. We arrived at 12pm when it said they opened for lunch, however when we got to the top of the tree the waitstaff were not ready for us yet. There were only 3 parties dining in the restaurant, but the service was slow. This wasn't a huge issue for us as we we're happy to sit and admire the view.We ate the smoked duck and fish curry, both were delicious. The started for Singapore chilli crab is a must
3
My husband booked this as a treat a month before we travelled to Singapore. The setting in the Trees is amazing, unfortunately you enter the restaurant by a rather scruffy and smelly lift! Views during the evening are stunning, 360 degrees. It's not cheap! Starters of the soup were mixed, my chicken was grisly and fatty but my husband had the lobster which he said was delicious. I had red snapper, prawn and scallop coconut curry, we had ordered rice with it as you would expect. It didn't arrive and we had to ask again for it which took a couple of minutes which was odd. My husband had lamb, they must have big lambs here, he had four cutlets and they were huge and delicious. We had wine (which was expensive) but you are a captive audience in a restaurant, we were still drinking after food plates were taken away and expected a dessert menu to follow. It didn't. 30 mins or so later we were asked if we wanted the bill. We asked for dessert menu. The staff were very attentive initially but as the place got busier the earlier diners tended to get forgotten.
3
Location was great, particularly drinks at sunset, having dinner and emerging to the lit-up trees. Food, whilst good, didn't quite represent value for money but it is after all a destination restaurant.
4
Having dinner in a tree is not such a common experience, however, the staff did their utmost to make us feel comfortable and the view was fantastic. The food was very good, portions very big, we could have skipped the starters.
3
Have the crab or seafood and desert. I would not recommend the chicken mince it was very disappointing.
5
Part of gardens by the bay
It is a feature small cost to do
Recommend fully the views at the top are brilliant
3
Its worth going for a drink and watching the sunset from this place it has also a great roof terras wich offers nice 360' of the city of Singapore
2
Paid the entry just to have a good view of the skyline at night. Service was terrible. I had to go up and order my complimentary drink (with ticket price) then go up and request a menu and had trouble getting someone's attention to order food. Food was very greasy but looked good, cocktail was below average and expensive. Did not enjoy the experience at all and wouldn't recommend
2
First we asked to go to to the restaurant which we were told was fully booked so we decided to go to the bar at the top of the tree, we were told that this will cost $20 per person and included one free drink with the ticket, you still have to buy a ticket even if you go to the restaurant. Straight away you fall into the tourist trap. The bar views yes were amazing. Worth $20??? Don't think so. We wanted food so asked for the restaurant menu. Food tasted something my child would make. Between four of us we ordered 4 mains and 1 starter. Total bill €212!!!!!! Chicken was tasteless, rice was overcooked. Save yourself from this over priced tourist trap and head to Marina Bay Sands bar for free access and the views. We went on a Sunday so access to the hotel bar was easy.
3
The experience was ok, however in our view: - The music was too loud (we had to ask twice to have it turned down) and out of date (Kenny G, from the 90s); - The chilli crab with rice cakes was a big disappointment. The heading should've been rice cakes with a dollop of crab and a hint of chilli; it really was rice crackers with pesto, there was hardly any chilli; see photo - The creme brûlée was grainy and had not properly settled; - The wine list was very overrated and expensive; we come from a wine region and - More realistic wine prices might have helped us enjoy the food more; - The beer was warm and we had to ask for iced blocks. We would no recommend this place though if you must, a once-off is enough.
4
While taking a walk through the gardens, you should also take the opportunity to go up on the Supertree for a wine or a beer. The view is great and it is not overflowed at all.It would be nice if the drinks were also served in glasses. We unfortunately only got fake winegrowers
4
The roof top bar for pre dinner drinks was good, with great views of Singapore skyline. Why we had to have plastic glasses for prosecco and glass glasses for beer is anybody's guess. Down one storey to the restaurant which was comfortable and had great views, with walkway around it for intra course entertainment. Food was amazing, service - well you can't have everything!! Genuinely helpful and pleasant, just not necessarily up to western standards of service. If you don't ask then don't expect the staff to know things like - you want the dessert menu (although it was offered between starter and main course). It was not cheap but well worth it for a memorable evening, having taken in the supertree light show first
5
Such an unusual futuristic sight. Great ingenuity even more magnificent at night time. We enjoyed seeing the beautiful sunset from the top an it was special to have a meal there. Large portions so need to share
1
By wife took me to Supertree as a birthday treat. The food was so bad, it ending up being an entertaining evening, but I certainly would not recommend this place to anyone I like.
5
Found "by accident" when walking through the park and what a find. The most unique location and especially stunning at night with all the trees lit up and the Marina Bay in the background.
5
go on there by night fall around 7pm its the best time to visit where you can enjoy with the light show and music
5
The three trees was amazing. It is located outside the Gardens by the bay, free entrance. You can view the Marina Bay from here as well. People said it is beautiful during night, I came on the afternoon.

We went to this restaurant yesterday for my son's birthday.Except the view, which is very nice, the negative points according to me : - the menu : poor skills (except the seafood platter which was OK), no side dish included (half of a tomato in the bottom of the plate ...). Nothing memorable - the service : no information given on the missing dishes prior you want to order it (no duck). We ordered 3 times the same dessert (the Vietnamese coffee crème brulée, one scoop of vanilla ice cream with vietnamese coffee syrup) ... but we have been served just an old and bad chocolate topping over the ice cream. We asked for the coffee syrup (this is why we ordered this dessert) but, they had none ! The ice cream was so bad that we left it as is in the plate- the restroom : i have been living in Singapore for a couple of years, we went to many restaurants, malls etc .. and the restrooms here are the dirtiest I've ever seen : no toilet paper, used papers on the floor, full dustbin... what a nightmare- the decoration of the restaurant is kitsch- the lift smells very badVery negative experience, and quite surprised to see a so low level restaurant in Singapore.I guess this restaurant is dedicated to tourists only, so the management is sure that they won't come back again ..
4
Could not fault this place. From booking to dining, the whole ambiance and experience was worth the visit.Took my dad there for his 90th birthday.They really looked after us. The meal was fantastic. Three of us all ordered different courses. Each was delightful. Best of all the servings were generous so we did not walk away hungry.The setting was superb. It was great to watch the light shows from on high.I would have given it 5 stars except for the wine price. But hey...that's Singapore - outrageous.Thoroughly recommend for that special occasion
5
(I can only speak to the rooftop bar, not the restaurant) This is an absolute favorite due to the 360 degree views, average drinks and above average truffle fries. Located directly behind the Marina Bay Sands, the sights capture the madness that is Singapore -- crazy downtown skyscrapers, huge architecturally impressive structures, and a massive industrial shipping yard.
3
The trees are amazing but food are just originally. We came as a team for our team dinner and drinks gathering. Unfortunately, before we arrived the rooftop the rain just stop not long ago. I felt a bit off with the arrangement as i told them i will arrived in a short while so i assumed they have already set all the table up for our reservation. But... due to the rain before that all the sofa seat and floor are so wet. For my advise was they should have a back up plan like keep some dry sofa cushion in the store and when this kind of situation happen, they can have dry cushion sofa for the customer to seat and enjoy the view. As wet sofa seated with a big group like us, it doesnt feel comfortable
5
A must see when in Singapore.Simply magic.like being in another world.centered in an exotic park setting.you get to see the Marina Sands hotel in the back ground. you are in the gardens by the bay,reclaimed land with 2 domed buidings one with the tallest indoor waterfall while other has botanical collection
3
you can walk around and see this, in progress, work of art: entry to skywalk is a bit pricey, and only for the brave.
3
We each payed $20 to sit at the treetop bar. We thought we were paying for admission to the treetop walkway. Wrong! Nice view but not worth the money. Could have gone somewhere else for cheaper.
4
we made reservations in advance to make sure we had a table here while visiting the gardens.The cocktails are good, the food is originally presented and different from what you find in the hawcker centers (i heard "fusion" would describe it). We had an hot plate with beef, soft shell crab, pomelo salad and cheesecake to top it, and all were good and quickly served. Only it isn't such a good viewing spot for the lightshow of the trees as we excpected! The views from the rooftop on the other hand of the surroundings at night are quite stunning
4
Spectacular view over Garden of the bay. You pay minimum 20SGD to get access to the topbar and you get a glass of Wine/Beer or Soft drink. We had three starters and could not finish them. All very fresh and tasty. Recommendations if you are already there
4
The restaurant is the equivalent of about 20 storeys off the ground in the biggest SuperTree of the grove in Gardens by the Bay - hence the superb views. If only it rotated as well!Food is asian fusion with strong Vietnamese influence (no surprise there, given the name of the restaurant group). It's served quickly and in sensible-sized portions rather than the increasingly common over-large plates that would basically feed two of me. The atmosphere is maybe a little thin as everybody's either looking at the views or eating exotic food...but that's OK to me.Tip from my friend - book for 7:30; get there for 6:00; have pre-dinner drinks outside at the rooftop bar whilst admiring a stunning sunset. My wife and I totally failed on the 6:00 drinks because we spent so long just wandering through the gardens themselves and the two huge pavilions
3
$20 for entry to the top, free drink - wine, beer, single spirit and mixer. In my opinion, unless you'd like a good look at the marina bay sands... this place isn't that great. It's a bit of a gimmick - nothing special and very dated. I went in the day though so would expect that the evening would definitely be a better time to visit for a drink when the gardens are lit up! Would have much more of a wow factor.
4
After enjoying the tour around the gardens by the bay and exploring the flower dome and the cloud forest we decided to dine at this resto. We picked the pasta with mushroom and the beef spareribs which is so tender. The staff is a filipina and we got good rate of discount for our bil
3
The restaurant is located in the best spot in the garden to watch the show at night. The space for the restaurant is awkward and not really working well for dinner atmosphere. The food is good, yet overpriced for the quality. When the light show starts, you can get outside and sit with a cup of tea watching the performance. Total check was about $150 per person for a dinner without alcohol
2
Bunch of metal instad of veiwNo good service No teapots! I love to have tea in pot :) I can't say anything about kitchen, I decided not to eat there.Maybe I was waiting for something more, thats why I'm dissapointed.For me this restaurant have unique location only, nothing els

Two ways to get to this restaurant. Go by Marina Bay Sands, walk through the overhead pedestrian walk to get to the Gardens (I was told this is more than 10 mins' walk). The second way is to take taxi and alight at the taxi stand, in front of the Visitor Center of the the Gardens. Then it would take less than 10 mins to walk to the restaurant. I used this latter way and yes, it's quite easy and fast to get to the restaurant. From the taxi stand, walk towards the Visitor Center and look for signboards pointing to Supertree Grove.The Supertree Grove is the tallest 'tree' in the Gardens so you can't miss it.The lift to the top floor restaurant is rather slow so you will have to wait a long while if there are many customers.Restaurant itself is nicely decored.All tables are lined up against the windows so that is nice. However, because of the many metal structures all over the Supertree, actually visibility to outside view isn't very fantastic at night. Just darkness and lightings.Service here isn't good. The waitress who showed us to our table and took our drinks and appetizer order wasn't seen much around our table section thereafter. We had to be on the lookout for anyone to catch their attention to take down our mains and dessert orders. Waiter and waitress were somewhat polite but not easily found. Instructions isn't very clear from the waiter too. I'd asked him about the lights show and he couldn't tell us clearly where it would happen. Basically he should have just told us to walk on the balcony area at 8.45pm and the lights are found on the supertrees.Instead, he only said - "8.45pm" and "can see from inside restaurant."We ordered a seafood platter as starter, followed by our mains and then dessert.The seafood platter had : prawns, mussels, oysters, scallops and sashimi salmon. Fresh and nice.For the mains, I chose the hotplate prime beef. My colleagues had hotplates too - wagyu and pork. This beef hotplate is my favourite dish - well seasoned, tender and juicy.Dessert was the most disappointing dish. I had the matcha cheese cake with ice cream. The cheese cake tasted like agar agar. No cheese taste and not much matcha taste.Here, each guest must be committed to spend about S$80++. This meal for 4 of us costed nearly S$490.Not cheap but then again, that's the price at this Marina Bay Sands area so I won't complain much. The restaurants at Marina Bay Sands top floor will cost minimally S$200 per person.So my biggest grouse for this restaurant - food is not very asean like; service is not good at all and lastly, not all dishes are good.I'll only come back here again if I'm hosting overseas guests, just for the ambience
4
Awesome place for a nature lover.... A must to visit if you are in Singapore.....the light show in evening is amazing to watch....
4
Everytime i have guests in SG, i always make it a point to bring them here, the view is wonderful esp at night. Its so convenient to just go up the supertree aftr watching the lights show.
3
Visited this premises on a Sunday. The upstairs bar was empty and packed up. Went up for refreshments only. The restaurant offered only filtered coffee. A pleasant place to visit for the views but that's it. Cannot comment on the food.
5
It's a small cover charge of $20 with a free drink to enjoy exclusive view of the area! During sunset, the silhouttes of the MBS creates a beautiful sight with Sg Flyer just within the vicinity. Nice chilling place for a cocktail!
4
Food was very good. Seafood sharing platter was tasty with great oysters and salmon. The beef was exceptional. The service was variable with suggestion of indifference. Views pf course were spectacular. Toilet was interesting complete with roman statute!
3
We were served in cooked chicken here. Very disappointing! They did offer to replace it, but everyone else had finished their meals and we wanted to leave.The view is amazing! We had booked a high chair but on arrival one was not available.Food is nice, but very limited menu
5
My husband took me here for my birthday and we had a wonderful meal in an incredible setting. The location is perfect if you are staying at MBS or visiting the Supertrees which are especially amazing to see at night. The views from the restaurant are breathtaking. We started with champagne and then had a really good bottle of white wine. Our food was delicious from start to finish. Appetizers included Vietnamese spring rolls, sushi rolls and lemongrass infused mushroom soup. My entree was fried snapper with a mango salsa and he had the lamb shank. The weakest link was the desserts but they were still very good. The service was top notch with a very knowledgeable and pleasant waiter. We finished the night up on the rooftop for more amazing views of the surroundings
3
My tittle says it all, much better to visit it when sun's down. WIth all the lights shining out of the trees, very nice. During the day, you're basically going to melt walking around here, as sun in Singapore during the day shines like no other. Just visit this place during night time
3
Paid $12 cover charge to go to restaurant for lunch. $12 included one drink, yep, one small glass of Diet Coke. Wouldn't even give us water to have with our meal. Food was great, view is great, but in my opinion, the negatives out weigh the positives
4
After booking the restaurant I read a few less than flattering reviews but decided to with by booking & find out for myself how enjoyable this place would be.Well after a most enjoyable evening where the staff were extremely accomodating & the meal was as tasty, well presented & high quality as would be expected for the price.. All I can say is some people are either very hard to please, dined on a bad night or just love a whinge.My one & only gripe is the price of alcohol $15 for 1/2pint of Tiger beer is a bit rich Steve & Dee GreenTasmania Australia
5
Super tree and the view when light passes on it its just amazing i miss. I can't believe such a great beauty of the place.
5
A super peaceful and cool place to go rather you are alone, with a your family or a spouse. Make sure you bring your camera.
5
Fantastic to see at nights when all the trees are light up and music is played in time with the music.
3
Food and service was ok.
Rooftop is nice with pretty view.
Restaurant seems cramp with no pretty view.
I ordered Lychee Martini. It tasted like Lychee juice! Complaint and they gave me a new one. Still taste terrible!
5
Visited during Nov 2016. It has light showed around 8 PM. It was beautiful and enjoyable to watch light and music.

So, this is the first time I've eaten in a giant metal tree, 50m above the ground...To go to the sky bar it was 12S$ for entry & a soft drink / coffee, 20S$ for an alcoholic beverage (Jan 17).Unlike the experience of other reviewers, we were given a selection of drinks to choose from I believe my husband chose from 3 beers.The rooftop bar itself was great and the views were better than those from the skywalk, in our opinion. The top bar was nicely set out but wouldn't be viable in bad weather.We were there at around 3:30pm, at that time we had the option of taking our dink on the rooftop bar, inside next to the restaurant it just outside on the walkway surrounding, there was only about 16-20 people there - when the place is full I'd imagine that choices might be a bit more limited.We decided to have a late lunch there which was no problem. Because we were classified as lunch dinners (or just dinners outside dinner) there was no minimum spend. At dinner it's clearly stated there is an 80S$ minimum per person. We may not have stayed if this applied to our sitting.We ended up having a platter (classified as for 4 people, but it was customized for the 2 of us). The food came out pretty quickly and was delicious. We found staff courteous and pleasant.I'd happily recommend SuperTree restaurant to anyone - outside dinner where there is an enforced minimum spend.The experience was unique, with great views, great views and pleasant staff
4
It´s nice place, not very cheap but should look. I relax there and take couple drinks. It´s nice place where can see view too and I think restaurant is nice there but this time I don´t go eat anything. When you buy ticket get 1 free drink so I think should try and go looking garden little more up
5
If you're looking for something filling perhaps you are looking at the wrong place. But it's filled with interesting Asian flavours inspired dishes and so delicate in their craftmanship of making them. They may be lack of experience in their cocktails (or perhaps just on that particular visit), but they served sincerely. Views up there were spectacular
1
Had booked a table for four here for our Christmas dinner. Food was ok, not bad, not excellent. What left us in a bad mood was the fact that during Christmas eve the restaurant had decided that the minimum order for any person had to be 150 dollar, so if you ate and drank for less than that, they would still charge you 150 dollar. What kind of nonsense is this!? I understand that they want to make as much money as possible during certain nights, but there are better ways to do it. For example; just say that during special evenings the prices are increased with say 30%. We would have been much more ok with an approach like that. Now we where constantly making sure that we did spend enough to reach the 150 dollar limit per person. Takes away a little from the friendly Christmas celebrations if you ask me

Purchased tickets for the Skywalk only to be told after that there will be a 20-30min queue for entry - Lining up in the sun on a stinking hot day with no shade didn't appeal...We left the queue and headed over to SuperTree, paid $18 ea for access and a cold beer and wine....Far better option....The tree sits about 20m above the skywalk and also offers roof terrace access which provides unparalleled 360 degree views of Singapore and surrounds....Didn't eat there, but enjoyed our drink and the awesome views - far better than queuing up to walk across a small air bridg

amazing stunning place. specially at night when the music starts. feels like a world out of this world.

I'm sorry to say that after catching a cab specifically to see the lights of the supertrees at night and paying $40 for two of us to go up to the restaurant for a drink we were very disappointed. Firstly we were not in the restaurant shown but in a rooftop bar which was much less attractive. Then we were told that for the included beer we only had one choice (even though I was happily shown quite a large selection when I said I might buy another one) which was Carlton dry. Come on even good old Tiger would have been better than the cheapest beer from where we live. While we waited I googled the times the trees would light up getting my camera ready for some great romantic photos. As the expected time ticked past and another 20 minutes or so and nothing but the ground lights came on I called over one of the staff and asked what time the lights would be coming on and was told they only come on sometimes not all the time and if we would like to wait another 30 minutes there would be a laser show from the hotel. Not quite the photos I was looking for. Total waste of time and money
3
If you have some extra time it's ok. Otherwise don't waste your time. The show or light shows starts at around 7:30pm. The giant trees has lights that sort of dances to the music. That's all. One of the tree has a door entrance where people can go up and walk on the bridge that connects to another tree. We didn't go up so we don't know how much they charge. But if you just want to watch the light show it's free. It's the only good thing about it
2
If you could get any service (drinks, menu, Bill) this would be a great place to go to enjoy the view of MBS. Cannot see the dancing trees at all.And, let me mention again, the service made this a horrendous experience. Ruined a beautiful night at the gardens

We had one evening in Singapore and went to Supertree by IndoChine for a drink with an impressive view. You have to go around the Supertree in the middle to find the entrance. The drink was really mediocre, but the view was breathtaking and absolutely worth going there.
1
The place is struggling to find its identity and whilst it's in this confused state it doesn't deliver anything to anybody. My advice would be to just pick a target customer group and focus the service, menu, ambience and pricing to that group. Right now it's a combination of high-end prices, below average food for the menu and the most tackiest and cheap looking decor possible, which again seems to be completely disconnect from the intended theme...I think. .. if there is an intention of a theme. The only plus point, and it's a big one, although not quite enough to compensate for the mediocrity of the restaurant is the view of the city from the roof top bar. The only highlight of our visit. It's a such a shame, because with this setting it could've so much more.

We booked for 7 people. I invited friends from Europe. We booked for dinner at 8pm, the table was ready at 8.45pm. The lady at the reception asked us to wait at the rooftop, but it was slightly raining and the rooftop bar was closed, awful management of customer experience and lack of customer service. During the 45 minutes wait, we had minimum updates and they did not even offer us water or any drinks as a gesture.The food is average, nothing wow. I definitely think that it is over priced.This is unfortunate for such location which is a major symbol in Singapore. Too bad..

If you are looking for a superb location to eat in Singapore for a special occasion then this should be it. The rooftop bar has fantastic views across the bay to MBS, out to the sea and over the rest of Gardens By the Bay.The food was of good quality and they have some different choices from your average Singapore restaurant but the service was painfully slow and they were not even busy. Even ordering cocktails at the roof top bar takes an age. So please come for the views and the experience but it is not cheap and be prepared for the wait.Oh, and by the way, it is also a nightmare to get to the place whilst the 'winter wonderland' event is on- they insisted on us buying a ticket to get in even though we had a reservation at the restaurant! We were assured this would be sorted after our visit but when the information desk at the front of Gardens By the Bay is giving you that message it is hard to see how they will fix it

we went to the super tree at night , we paid 18 dollar pp as entry fee plus a drink (wine or beer) then took an elevator to the bar where we sat and enjoyed our drink and the landscape we had a complete view to marina hotel , garden domes , city and flyer its been amazing . must go . we didnt go to the restaurant which located on the lower floor its been so pricey , the cheapest item was about 80 us
4
It was my birthday and my sister in law was visiting from the States so my husband brought us to an impromptu lunch here while we were sightseeing in the gardens. We ordered quite a few things from the menu : Handpounded Papaya Salad, Pomelo and Tiger Prawn Salad, Tom Yam Lobster Broth with Asian Spices (Both the cream and n0n-cream versions), SAMLA KROEUNG SAMOT - Cambodian Seafood in a Coconut Curry all accompanied by rice (brown for me and white for them). For dessert we had : Vietnamese Creme Brûlée and Japanese Matcha Cheesecake. The total bill came up to SGD 370 including service charge and taxes. We had definitely overspent (splurged too much!) as we thought it would come out to SGD80++ per person. However all of us unanimously enjoyed our lunch there and the view. Only that we felt that the deco of the restaurant was super tacky and mismatched. The wait staff were not exactly very warm but well, at least they were attentive
5
Cool place to visit! like you came to a different planet or to the future where some Avatar creatures or robots will appear
4
It was a superb venue for lunch with the team. The cuisine was simply delicious, the service super and the view outstanding. Loved the subtle flavours and my coffee based cocktail. Must visit
5
In my opinion a fascinating project! For just a few dollars you can buy a ticket and board the elevator to the canopy where you step out and enjoy the views and can walk on the elevate platform between the tree tops! Clever
5
Incredible piece of human ingenuity. Lovely at night with the lights sparkling on the tree groves . Must visit
5
Something totally different to do. Rooftop bar has AMAZING views! Restaurant has great menu. Food was delicious! Service ok. Would be a hilight of our trip.
5
Tour around Marina Bay and you will see these Giant trees, colorful lights and dont miss the show at 7:45pm!
4
We came early to watch the sunset at the rooftop bar and it was amazing. The 360degrees view is awesome. I really recommend this place for the view. But for the food at Indochine, i think it is overprice. Well, the food comes with great views too especially at night, I admit the views are spectacular but the food is so so. The waiter forget to put our main menu and so it takes us quite a long time waiting for the main course to come, we didn't realised it as we were busy taking pictures..... but the manager was quick to response and apologised to us by giving us complementary desert.... hope they can improve their service..

My review is for the bar at the top of the SuperTree, not the restaurant. The view from the top of the SuperTree is stunning as it is a 360% open bar area with views to the sea, CBD, Marina Bay Sands and East Coast. It is not as high as MBS so you get a different perspective and the chance to look back at MBS (not the usual Marina Bay View). I recommend going at sunset to see the city slowing move into night and the lights of the city come to the fore. A breeze in the evening makes it perfect. So arrive at say 6:30pm, leave at 7:45pm just in time for the light show at Gardens By the Bay just outside the SuperTree on ground level. The cost to go up to the bar is S$18, so not cheap, but that includes your first drink

...Like, there are several levels of fail buried deeper than the fail you can see. So, we get dressed up in our evening best, and turn up at the Supertree. Its impressive enough. A great big man-made structure that resembles a metal tree. We go toward the entrance, its a bit like a lighthouse; theres a small door at the foot. There is a concierge there to check our reservation. The place is lit up like a christmas tree - all green and blue neon coming from these weird slightly tacky looking lights. But we know its an Indochine restaurant so we're not worried yet. They're all classy and stylish right? Wrong. So after the concierge confirmed our reservation, and sends us upstairs. We walk thru the entrance, and into the Supertree itself; a shabby corridor filled with what looks like cheap bric-a-brac for sale at ridiculous prices. No one's actually in there, its just a passage to the lift which someone saw fit to fill with rubbish - literally: there were a few bags of garbage by the fire exit, and some builders stuff. We go up the lift. When we come out, there is another concierge - who inexplicably, checks our reservation again. Maybe because we managed to lie our way past the first concierge? Then we're shown to our seat...they walk us by the bar, and the first thing we notice is the green neon LED lights behind the bar - and we're not talking fancy fibre optics or something artistic; its basically the stuff you see at Bangkok night markets. I can buy in Sim Lim for 10 bucks. Then we notice the christmas lights. Yes, Christmas lights. Great big clusters of them, cheap and tacky balls of plastic hanging all over the place. Then we notice the green astroturf they've used as a kind of wallpaper. Then we notice that all of this serves to cause glare on the windows, so you can't actually see outside the spectacular view of Singapore skyline, we just see a reflection of garish christmas lights. Then we see our zebra/cowpat mohair seat, and the disco ball hanging from the ceiling directly above us. In short, it feels like a cheap and tacky restaurant you'd find attached to a hostel in Kuta - nothing at all like the other Indochine restaurants.The staff at least have the good grace to look embarrassed about it all, I mean, would you be happy about working a 10hr shift in there? I really felt for them...service wasn't good, but I didn't have the heart to hold it against them. I'd be sour if I had to work there too. The worst part of all this is that the food is actually excellent. (Indochine have several restaurants in Singapore; incidentally, my old boss took my wife and I to the Empress Place branch in 2010 when pitching the idea of permanently relocating to Singapore, and it sealed the deal - it was that good)So we sat down, ordered a couple of cocktails and some spring rolls, looked at the mains menu & wine list...we did the math; staring down the barrel of a $300+ meal for two all-in....after a couple of nibbles and sips and consideration, we decided to quit while we were ahead. Just paid for the cocktails / rolls, walked out, and got some street food. Reading the other reviews, it was definitely the smart play. With so many awesome restaurants in SG around this price range, paying $150 a head for anything that isn't a 100% on-point experience seems silly - you can eat at Wolfgang Puck, Senso or Pollen for that...I really hope they get it together and step up the offering (or lower their prices!). Such a shame

You arrive to Singapore and you are greeted by a modern, dazzling and clean city. But not here in any case. On arrival, you would go inside a lift, that is dirty, looks quite unkept and stinks. Once you are upstairs, you would be led to your table. The table was ok. The menu we were given looked as if it is a menu from your local take away (except for the prices). The toilet looked as it can do with an update as a minimum, better refurbishment, access to ladies toilet was a bit awkward, probably would not be very easy for disabled people. The quality of food was ok. They did not have the champagne we wanted and it took them ages to offer an alternative. In our booking confirmation they said, that you have to be with long trousers and no flip flops are allowed, so we made an effort and I felt overdressed. As most of the men came in shorts and I have noticed many people wearing flip flops. All in all, very poor experience, hugely overpriced. There are many more restaurants in Singapore, that offer you a better view, and better experience. You would not be able to watch the show from there, as you need to be on the ground for it
4
Different experience whether you go at night or day but either way still great. awesome views and awesome look at some incredible accomplishments in ingenuity.
4
Place has good views of the city but at the time we went the rooftop bar was not serving. The SGD$18 entrance fee included a "draft beer" but they gave us a bottle of Budweiser. Little disappointed with that, but the staff was polite.
3
Ten Singapore dollar charge entrance fee includes a free soft drink.expensive as a entrance fee and soft drink small measure.The views are worth the effort by the stairs to get to the top a lift is available but not clean.
5
We went with a group of 40 people and the staff were fantastic The food was wonderful and the beer cold!! Allow a couple of hours to explore the gardens. A nice rooftop bar.
5
I came before sunset and it was the most romantic evening I had with my wife enjoying snacks and the backdrop view of MBS. awesome!

Indochine restaurants used to be a brand name meaning very nice ambiance and really good food. Supertree by Indochine is a huge let down. For just over SGD 100 per head you expect a 5 star treatment. This restaurant gets 2 stars from our party and that is only because of its location in Garden by the Bay. The food was awful and tasteless. Enough said. A young girl sitting down behind a computer screen omits to stand up or greet you when you enter and on departure the staff had already started their own dinner at the bar before the restaurant had closed. We sat outside and had to try to wave through the glass window every time we wanted some attention. This is such a pristine location that the restaurant should be at the same level however sadly that is not the case
3
We came here after a visit to the gardens. The food was average but expensive for what you got. But for the location it's understandable. We felt a bit rushed as we were the last in the restaurant and felt we needed to finish our wine on the roof garden so they could clear our table. Our waitress was so kind and friendly ( she didn't make us feel rushed ).The view was great
4
Although the service on the night we visited was average at best, we enjoyed the food (or was it the drinks) and the views. The venue itself is quite nice, if you aren't bothered by the constant snapping of pictures. Given the excellent food choices in Singapore, you have better options in a far less touristy place. I'd stick to drinks at the open air bar above the restaurant
2
Very uninspiring entry in, $10 to get a free drink at the top. Thought the lift was horrible, seemed to be stuck on level 1 which gives you a bit of a fright but apparently its 16 floors up so stays on 1 until it gets to 2 then 3 is where you get off. Asked if I could do stairs to get down and they said no as there were no security cameras and they couldn't guarantee my safety...not sure how dangerous those stairs were!Inside the restaurant super tacky and cheap looking, seemed dirty to me and I wouldn't want to eat there. Service was average, not a lot of excitement or friendliness from staff. We were placed next to the toilet..always uninspiring. View was good to Marina Bay but has it had been raining we couldn't go out to the deck and sit...if the staff had wiped down the chairs we could have as it wasn't raining at the time and clearing but I think they were busy not giving a damn
4
Friday afternoon we gathered in Gardens by the Bay and decided to go for drink and bite at Supertree open-air bar. Fantastic, 360 view, especially around dusk!! Food is relatively expensive but 4-persons platter was really tasty. Entrance is 18SGD per adult, for which you get a drink.
4
We sat upstairs on the rooftop deck for happy hour and there were gorgeous views and sunsets. We then went downstairs and had dinner and the food was ok. Four out of five stars. A bit expensive for what you get.
4
Went with a view to having a drink and mediocre food... however completely surprised by both the food and the setting. All I can say is great to both and well worth a visit.
5
Restaurant is in a beautiful location. Food was delicious. The atmosphere was great. Could walk outside of restaurant on the platform, which was cool. The rooftop bar was nice and a great location to have drinks.
Visited back in June 2015.
5
If you are looking for a better place to take a closure picture with Marina Bay Sand, this is the best choice.
4
Outstanding views, good food with adequate service, definitely worth doing once. For a visitor to Singapore this is a reasonable value venue with an outstanding location.
5
The super trees are unique in their sculpture and will be ever so beautiful when the plants are fully grown over them. Had a very pleasant day just walking around the area and would recommend for anyone that loves gardens and nature. Wished we had been there at night to experience them when the lights were on but i believe they would look amazing

Have you ever dreamt of eating in a massive circular luxury tree cabin and having all types of south east asia crusine at your finger tips to experience? How about taking you on a fusion journey to show how much modern asian has progressed in the past 10 years while gazing 360 degrees into some of the most spectacular views of singapore and marina bay? How about feasting a menu designed on organice high quality produce but to also provides you with healthy additives? If you answered yes partly or wholly to anything above then supertree by indochine is definately an experience you need to put on your checklist of things to do in singapore!!! We stayed at Marina bay sands and was just a quick 10min stroll through the gardens. We were having dinner with family booked by my uncle. Upon arrival downstairs we were greated by a lovely hostess who put down her phone immediately to direct us how to get up the supertree. The foyer had cultural items displayed on display for you to view while waiting for the lift to arrive to beam you up to level 1 which is 40 metres high or so. Once the lift doors opened we were welcomed by 2 smiling staff who took us to the table. While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive we had asahi beer on tap and was informed we were able to go to the roof top while waiting for other guests. They did have a extensive beverage menu but had to saw no due to a 1am flight. And OMG, the rooftop was a sight to behold. The rooftop incapsulated singapore in a 360 degree view setting and is worth the entry fee to come up to the rooftop just to immense yourself in picture perfext views even if you are not dinning in the resturant. The rooftop had a bar and able to order finger food and some other meals. Finally when other guests arrived, we returned to the table and the food was ordered. I just want to point out the timing of each entree and main meal was superb. From when the share entree platter came to the salman larb, you never felt as if you were waiting nor overwhelmed with food. Below are the results you have all been hungrily drooling for: Super tree share platter 8/10 *The lychee beignet rolls on a spoon with a splash of the dipping sauce was heavenly and 100% the highlight. The rice cake rolls, prawn rolls, and grilled squid was high in quality but wished the chef could a little bit more spin to it. For example having the squid marinate in the lime chilli sauce instead of grilling it naked to then dip into sauce.Salmon raw carpaccio (Larb) 9.5/10*Traditional flavours of larb using high quality salmon, what else can i say? Every bite was as luxurious as the first and the fat ratio of the salmon used had to be picked from the heavens above.Only wish if there was a little bit more of seasame seed for extra texture and crunchPapaya Salad 9/10*Hands down one of the best papaya salad i have ever eaten in a fusion or modern asian resturant. The spice to dressing ratio was spot on with the amount of dried shrimps used which gave a balanced and fresh taste everytime you took a mouthful of the salad. The papaya was crunchy and slightly tangy which is a great sign of freshness and quality in there kitchenWild Atlantic lobster with EE-FU noodles 9/10*This dish would have to be my value pick of the menu. Even though i did pay for the bill i still really wanted to know the cost of this traditional mouth watering dish. SG$68 (AUD$60) for a full lobster (350g - 400g size or so) on a massive bed of soft stir fried noodles cooked with a recipe that took me back to hongkong. This hands down would have cost AUD$100 - $150 average in most modern asian resturants in Australia. The lobster was cooked to perfect timing to still retain its natural juices and not drying out accompanied with the noodles which still had spring in every bite and coated with a traditional inspired stir fry sauce which made eat the noodles with nealry every other dish just to try to come up with some crazy combination.45 day grainfed lemongrass lamb rack 10/10*To me this was the holy grail of the menu. The one dish that i recommend you have try to understand what modern asian fusion is in this day and age. From the asian marinating of lemon grass to the asian inspired sweet and sour Jus to then be plated with truffle dressed potato beignet was a sight i will cherish for a very long time. Then when you cut a piece of lamb dipped in the Jus then chase it with the potato beignet which had been showered by the truffle cream was just a explosion of flavour.Whole snapper crispy fillet 7.5/10*high quaility produce used to produce your usual high standard dish which is on 80% of modern asian menus. Great crunch from the mango salad and when paired with the snapper dipped in fish sauce, it gave a extra dimension of texture to deliver a well rounded dish. This was the last dish to arrive and i actually had my expectations set really high for this dish escpecially after the lamb rack and was hoping that there would be a unique element. I wish the chef cound have added more spices in the coating before frying such as five spice, pepper or even onion powder and spice powder with pepper to give it a extra zing. But hey, im no chef :)Overall food experience is 9/10Overall restaurant experience 10/10Overall service experience 9/10Overall this needs to be on your to do list in singapore I recommend going around 6pm so you can experience the sunset views and also the spectacular night views on the rooftop. No other resturant in singapore can provide a 360 degree paranomic views of singapore from the gardens to the bay hence 10/10 for restaurant experience. They always had a smile and always made sure your glass was full with whatever alcohol or water you may had ordered.Also forgot to mention the free nightly entertainment all the surrounding trees put on at 730pm which you can enjoy on the rooftop with a cocktail or below with the crowds, lazily laying on the floor after a unforgettable flavour journey Indochine has just taken you on there unique flagship restaurant, Supertree. Yours flavourly,TFT - The Fatty Touris

Spectacular view from the rooftop, it was amazing to watch a thunderstorm roll in. The restaurant was nice - i liked the decor and the staff was friendly. The food was good but not mind-blowing. The asparagus was especially nice, and the mango sticky rice was delicious. Note that there is a minimum $80 charge per person for dinner (we didnt realize before we sat down)
5
It provides Vietnam and Thai food, with rather good drinks.The view is the best, Almost all the seating are window seats.You can have a walk on the balcony outside the glass after dinner, watching the light show below.Price is quite reasonable.A minimum spend of 80++ is required for dinner
1
Me and my Fiance decided to try the rooftop bar of the indochine during our last visit and we were very disappointing. Little to no effort seemed to go into the place. it cost us $16 to get into the place only to find it almost completely empty. We soon found out why it was empty after we ordered our $22 drinks to discover they were well below average for Singapore, in taste and presentation. The service as well was...not great
4
Just have to see from a far, close up, from the top and at night just don't miss these, let your imagination go wild about the land you just entered
4
Must be done I suppose. Ticked of the list. Ce la vi has better views, much better quality/choice of drinks and is relatively better priced.
Staff are friendly and helpful.
Any clouds and the roof bar is closed as is the walkway. Be warned.
2
SuperTree Grove and the Gardens by the Bay are magnificent, but there's no reason to drink or eat at Supertree by IndoChine. The service is some of the worst ever - awful, rude staff who ignored everybody on a Saturday evening and seemed to have no care for their jobs or guests. Food was decent but costly (understandable considering the locale) but drinks were weak and offered zero variety; one rail/cheap alcohol with one mixer, that's it for $18 (gin & tonic, whiskey & coke, etc.) It's completely outdoors so if it's too hot or too cold you're fully exposed with no wind barrier, no fans, no ac, no shade. The view is better from the OCDC Sky Bridge below. Skip this unnecessary bar in the sky, especially considering the worst service we've seen anywhere in Asia in 25 years
2
Although perched at the top of a super tree in the Gardens by the Bay, this restaurant is more hype than substance. First the decor is horrific with the theme probably something to do with Qing dynasty china. Although some (perhaps the omnipresent Chinese tourists) will find that interesting, it is actually quite uncomfortable and distracting if you are looking for a quiet dinner. At the top of the super tree one would expect a great view but it is totally obscured by the rings of metallic supporting structures. The food was average; the menu offers many vegetarian options but their idea of making a non vegetarian item is by omission and not substitution. There is no culinary innovation and they still charge you the same price when they remove the prawns from a pomelo and prawn salad. The saving grace was the rooftop bar which offers a panoramic view but is very crowded.I will not return to this place anytime soon.

First off, the positive - the view is fantastic. Sit on one side and you get a wonderful view of the marina. Sit on the other side and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel looms large. However, if you do sit on that side, you will struggle not to wish that you were up there instead.This place needs to work out what it wants to be. Does it want to offer table service, or a walk up bar service. At the moment, there is no system, it is horribly unprofessional, and the staff are either incompetent, or confused (or both). The entry fee of S$18 gets you one drink of house wine or a spirit. Given the limited choice of drinks, and the fact that there were maybe 20 people up there, and 5 staff, you would have thought that the drinks would arrive relatively quickly. After 20 minutes of sitting there, we discovered (after going up to speak to the barman) that our drinks had been poured some time ago, and the waiters had simply left them on the side. No attempt had been made to locate us (I had pointed to our table when I ordered the drinks), and no apology was made when we finally got our drinks.We then gave the place the benefit of the doubt and decided to get a couple of cocktails, priced at S$20 each; more fool us! We had seen that some people had ordered from their table, so tried to catch the eye of several of the waiters, who were standing around doing nothing. No luck. We then decided to order at the bar. I joined a short queue (with about 3 people in front of me) and waited for someone to take orders. It took around 5 minutes for one of the waiters standing idly by to go to the front of the queue and start taking orders. After the first couple were taken, a large group came up the stairs and sat down in reserved seats (incidentally, we had tried to book a table and were told that seats cannot be reserved). All of the waiters, including the one at the front of the queue, rushed over to the group to (presumably) start taking orders from them. At this stage, the people in front of me in the queue decided they'd had enough and left. I waited and was eventually able to give my order after about 10 minutes of queuing.Half an hour later, our drinks still hadn't arrived. Watching the bar, the barman had plainly got fed up of expecting the waiters to take customers' orders, and started taking them himself. This was, unsurprisingly, fantastic for the people who were making the orders at that point, as the barman would quickly make them their drinks. Unfortunately, those of us that had relied on the waiters taking the order had to continue to wait. We were on the verge of leaving (we had stood up and left the table) when our drinks suddenly materialised. Whether they had been coincidentally made just in time, or whether they had been made some time before and forgotten about, I do not know.This bar has the feel of a provincial pub that has only just opened, and was swept off its feet. Unfortunately, this is a pricey bar, in a modern city, which has been open for some time, and which was less than half full. The staff are uncoordinated, don't seem to know their role, and have no communication between one another. You can get the view in a number of places in Singapore. Avoid this one

I had read great things about the Supertree and was really looking forward to visiting. We paid S$18 entry and stepped inside where we were met with a fishy odor. After getting the lift to level 3 we were told it was best to go to the open rooftop before claiming our free drink. The views are incredible but the bar was closed and looked slightly the worse for wear. You can't really look down because of the structure of the treetop but the horizon view is great. I'm sure it looks better at night. We went back downstairs to get our drink and to take in our surroundings. The top half of the walls are covered in plastic cloverleaf and plastic ivy is coiled over some exposed pipes. I'm not sure if this is meant to continue the garden theme but it just looks tacky. Again, I'm sure it looks better at night. We didn't stay to eat. I've ticked that box and don't feel the need to go back

Following a great afternoon at the Bay Gardens we finished off the day with a sunset meal and drinks at the Indochine Bar at the top of the Supertree. The restaurant was full so we paid $18 pp - which is fine as it included 1 free drink each (beer, wine or spirit) which is pretty much the same price for a drink in the CBD.The views are fantastic of the city and the bar has an easy, relaxed feel to it.But the service really lets it down. In 2hrs we had 2 drinks - one of which we were handed upon arrival. The food came quickly but we had to ask 3 times to order. Each time being dismissed and told to wait. Even asking for a menu seemed a lot of trouble.There are some big groups I think that prepay or book ahead which seem to take priority as table service seemed fine for them. We on the other hand struggled even when going to the bar.Our food plates were left on our table for almost 1.5hrs and when we complained after failing again when attempting to order a 3rd drink the bar manager just shrugged his shoulders.I would say visit this bar for the views and to take a few pics but don't go as a destination. One drink venue!!And leave the cocktails $20+ and mainly just ice!

We went there with my girlfriend during our trip to Singapore. First impression: no music... Which is really weird, for a "bar". I don't know if it was just the day we went, or everyday, but for me bar goes with music. Anyway, we had to pay SGD18 to enter the bar, and this includes one drink (red/white wine, beer, etc... but not cocktails). We ordered wine, and then one cocktail each. The waiter brought us only one cocktail, after waiting for more than 20 minutes, and we had to wait another 15 minutes for the second cocktail. At midnight 20, they brought the bill, because they "close at 2am" but the last order is at midnight 30. We thought that it was pretty rude/stupid from them not to ask if we wanted a last drink before they would close the bar. Even though the view is amazing (we can see MBS and other parts of Singapore, it is truly amazing), we will never come back there, because it is a waste of time/money

Not Singapore standards, dirty tea cupsAll the places in Singapore are of high standards, clean and sufficient, the gardens is beautiful, maybe we were in the tower at the wrong time, and maybe the thailand adverts on the walls has something to do with it

One of the highlights of my trip to Gardens by the Bay was the rooftop bar in the largest Supertree. There is a covercharge to get in, but it includes a drink so really more of a minimum. Worth noting that the bar does serve the restaurant menu without the wait or reservation. I particularly enjoyed the open air and breeze with an incrsible 360 view of Singapore. Highly recommended
5
The food is awesome, the location is perfectly located and the staff are friendly and prompt.. Will certainly come back again...
2
Grapefruit juice was awful.
The view of restaurent is not good but rooftop bar is okay.
Food took so long time and the taste was so-so.
Kind staffs though.
4
Great open top roof top at the SuperTree by IndoChine. Great place to be with a group of friends chilling with the amazing view.
5
Stunning meal and even better desert. The staff are very very friendly and we were looked after with little fuss. The views from the canopy are 2nd to none. A big thank you to Ngasri for looking after us both
5
You have two options to enter the Supertree:1. Pay SGD10 to enter with a complimentary non-alcoholic beverage, or2. Pay SGD18 to enter w/ a complimentary alcoholic beverage: Choose wine!The rooftop bar starts serving after 5pm but you can definitely head there to explore and enjoy a non-obtrusive 360 view of the surrounding attractions. When the bar opens, it's THE place to enjoy a lively and breathtaking view as the sun sets

We were a party of four and we had booked a table. We were seated in a location where we could see MBS in the background, so it was nice.Food-wise the choices were reasonable diverse and good and I liked my lamb chops medium well (it was swell). Best to order a few small plates to share rather than the platter in our opinion. The range of beers was rather limited though, so its more wine-centric. Cocktail selections is sufficient. Now you would not be here expecting low prices, so yes the meal costs commensurate with the location.Service was prompt and efficient. No complaints there.If dining, then it is good to have drinks at the rooftop bar first if weather permits (ie no rain). Views while sipping your drink is a rather memorable experience. Though we were told it could be busy, it was not full on the day we were there, but do make an inquiry to book ahead. Remember to look out for the light show at 7:45 and 8:45. View it from the rooftop if you can

We visited Indochine on the Super Tree with 2 friends as a apart of a birthday celebration. The experience was good and we all agreed we would come back. Unfortunately we arrived by taxi from the serenity of Raffles to the chaos of the foyer of the Marina Bay Sands. After struggling with the Saturday night crowds at Gardens By the Bay we finally arrived at the Super Tree.The food was generally good but the sashimi was just wonderful. The wines are expensive but normal by Singapore standards, and the beers were well chilled and reasonable in cost. The service was cheerful but a bit all over the place and the main course really arrived too quickly after the entree.The views from the restaurant and from the deck outside were great and the 4 of us really had a lovely night. We also had the entertainment of watching a young man give an engagement ring to a young lady at the next table, Well they looked very young to us.Restaurants like Indochine are not only about the food it is about the whole package which we greatly enjoyed
2
We visited the SuperTree by IndoChine restaurant on the 6th September. Entrance carries a $10/$18 cover charge, which includes one drink (extra for alcohol). The location is absolutely superb with an amazing view; you could easily imagine it for late evenings watching the Gardens, southern anchorage and the Marina Bay area. Sadly this all seems wasted on the operator of the restaurant; despite only being a few years old it has a very sad, run-down feel to it; the parquet is peeling, broken tables have been patched up with duct-tape, and the staff just don't seem to care. It feels more like a backwater 3* hotel in a 3rd world country, not a prestige location in Singapore (with prices to match). It might be worthwhile to grab a quick glass of juice there instead of taking the Skybridge, but the wasted potential in the location is just sad, and really surprising considering what it does to the IndoChine brand.
4
I used to love Indochine on the quay so was shocked it has closed down. Went to this new one by Indochine and the good remains as good but it's up a disney'esqe tree in the new botanical gardens. It's kind of weird but in a ok I enjoyed it way. Difficult to fault and worth going once
5
Sneaky little entrance is so hidden you might just miss it and then miss out on the most spectacular views of Singapore. It is well worth the cover charge of $18 SGD, inclusive of a bottle of beer. Even if you are on a low budget holiday this is worth seeing. This is the best vantage point in the entire Super Tree Grove and a secluded roof top bar with jaw dropping views. Did I mention that it's very romantic, you can feel the balmy breeze up on the rooftop kiss your skin as you cuddle up to your lover. Note: Cocktails average $ 20 SGD e.g. Espresso Martini. You can also order snacks at the bar or dine at the restaurant. These are a litttle costly but who cares, if it means you get to stay up there in the heavens for a little longer. It's well worth the price
5
It was very relaxed, the cover charge was worth it with the free beer/housepour and the view. You'd never think such a place existed in the Gardens.
5
Food was great. View spectacular. Take time for after dinner at the bar on top. Very romantic. Would go there again.
3
Great views from these fabulous structures. there is a walkway in between some of the larger supertrees which is worth climbing up to see the views. We have a lovely day at Gardens by the Bay and climbing the supertrees was part of this amazing experience
4
We had a group of 14 people. While waiting for the other group to arrive we had drinks on the rooftop bar. The view was amazing. It was not very crowded so you can celebrate special occasions or have intimate moments with your loved ones. Dinner was great, we had appetizer platters and ordered mains to share. It was vegetarian friendly too. We also had very good red and white wines
5
The Super Tree grove within Gardens by the Bay is the most iconic image of these gardens. One can't help but be transported to a different world when walking beneath these soaring and colorful "trees". I recommend a walk along the suspended bridge at dusk, it's a beautiful perspective of the gardens below.
5
$18S will get you up to this bar with a complimentary drink, when you get up there the views are stunning, itâ€™s lounge type seating is relaxing and comfortable. The staff are very helpful and polite; I could have stayed up there for hours but there was so much more to see and do. I would recommend going up there as it is higher than the Skywalk and gives you a better view
2
My husband and I booked this restaurant for the experiece of eating in the midst of the super trees. We had read some pretty poor reviews of the restaurant, so had no great expectations. It certainly lived up to the bad reviews. Although the wait staff tried hard to make the best of a Fawlty Towers type stuff up, and all but one course out of seven, between the the 2 of us, was very ordinary, the xperience of being high up in the supertrees, with the beautiful views over the Marina was worth the expense of a bad restaurant as a just the once
5
Minimum spend at dinner is S$80/per person but worth every penny. Food is excellent and great wine selection. After dinner go to rooftop bar and lounge with amazing views. (free if you have dinner there) Drinks are well made and staff was very friendly. Service was excellent. View of the light show on top of one of the super trees is a must for anyone traveling to Singapore
4
My husband took me to Indochine in Gardens by the Bay for a special birthday celebration.Views were amazing and ambience very good. Alcohol incredibly expensive - cheapest bottle of wine was SGD85.00 - you would pay approx AUD20.00 in Australia for the same,Food was excellent - best spring rolls I have every tried!!Service was a little hit and miss. We had two waitresses looking after us - one younger lady was fantastic and she really looked after us, whereas an older lady was very offhanded and couldn't really have cared less.We discovered the bar above the restaurant when we were leaving which was a shame as we would have enjoyed a pre-dinner drink there. We had a look and it seemed the perfect place for a great view of the city and a relaxing drink.All in all a lovely experience
1
location and view is amazing. service is horrible. hostess couldnt be bothered when she couldnt locate a confirmed reservation; nobody to seat you when at the indoor areas; waited 10 mins at the rooftop bar and was given a palm to signal wait. it's perfectly alright if you were busy because we waited but when the gentleman was available he just came and mentioned did you come from the restaurant and was rude. he emphasized that everyone else paid entry fee thats why. i mean for diners and paying for entry, does it really matter? it was meant to be a celebration but thanks every one of the people on shift ruined every part of the celebration. if only expats are welcomed, if all you care about is entry fee i would strongly suggest that you convert the place into a club. terribly disappointing for indochine chain at such a prestige location to be so horrible. the place is amazing so if you could work on the people please. thanks
5
€18 buys you a drink and entrance to this lovely high perch from where you can view the night show at the Gardens, and see the city lights. Not crowded, and good for photos. Staff very nice.
5
Great service, great view and excellent service. The Khmer seafood curry was amazing and chef's choice BBQ King Prawns were even better. We had lunch here but will be back for dinner and the light show
5
completed only 2 years back, this is a must visit for any tourist in singapore.....there are several very tall trees and one can go up the walkway for a 15-minute walk.....in the evening the lights offer an amazing view of the trees.....
5
You can love simply this place. I have seen this trees for the first time. This place is really a charming one.
5
The bar/restaurant is great! Worth the S$18 to get up here and includes 1 drink. It's air conditioned! And you can spend more than 15 minutes...(which is what they give you on the walkway) Also the walkway it S$8 and thre was a line. Ugh. There are 2 stories too, the upstairs is outside so it can be hot but the view is fantastic! Also the included bottle beer was ales Tennants, which is a lager, and the wine was a Chardonnay, good and very cold! We loved it
1
We booked her to enjoy a special meal on the last night of our honeymoon. It started off well, gorgeous view, drinks and starter arrived quickly. Then we waited over an hour for our main course. It seems we reminded them that we were still waiting after 45mins as they hadn't even noticed. When our food finally arrived (mine 5 mins after my husbands) I felt like we were just ignored. We asked 3 people to get a manager and when he finally arrived he didn't seem to know what was going on. I felt like it was all blamed on on waitress, who was very apologetic, yet she didn't take our order nor bring our drinks or starters over. Yet she seemed to be the one who has to pick up the pieces and speak to us. After we spoke to the manager he disappeared and never returned. We were told by the waitress we could have free desserts but we were no longer hungry, we had been there for over 2 hours now. When the bill arrived we found that they had taken 20% off food- not drinks and the $20 service charge was still on there!! After a disappointing meal we decided to go upstairs to the rooftop bar enjoy on last drink, after waiting 20 minutes we walked out. Awful experience in such a nice setting. Do not waste your money by going!
2
Beautiful place and great vistas.However, the food is okay (had better, also better from IndoChine in the past) and rather pricey. The rooftop bar is a great hangout for a drink. But maybe only for one drink with a small beer for 15/16 SGD (!)Go for the views, but better culinary experience you will find elsewhere.
4
The most unusual but as is normal with Sinapore a breathtaking venue. The food and service was very good with a mixture of flavours and textures. The only thing stopping me giving this 5 stars was the toilets. Whilst this should definitely not stop you from going here, they were poor when all considered, but overall it was a fantastic experience
4
I was lucky to secure a last table when I called. The setting was nice and you can actually walk out to a balcony to watch the night lights. Order 2 starters and lychee pork was good. Main dish we ordered red drum fish and the best was kurobuta. Bill was S$201.00 include 3 beers. Pretty reasonable for such a place. Service was extremely good. Recommend to go, especially for a romantic meal, but book in advance.
4
The entrance is $10 but includes a free softie..so when you compare this the the Skywalk at $8 in the heat it's a good option if you want to sit in air con and recover :) Make you way up to the roof top bar for super uninterrupted views and a lovely breeze
5
It was an amazing place... Very relaxing while your drinking your Chardonnay. This place is one of my favorite place... And the service was good and the staff are nice. I recommend this place... Very beautiful 😊❤️
5
Awe inspiring beauty in man made form. The Artist who designed this Super Tree garden was creative and inspiring.
Lovely bistro at the top of the biggest super tree, if you want to be parted with your money!!
5
This is part of "Gardens by the Bay" and where the free light and music show takes place. The show is worth a visit to the park. There are MANY other things to do (water park, bike paths, etc).
5
The best view in Singapore in my opinion as you can everything, including the Marina Sands Bay building up close... came here for late night drinks with my work conference crew... so relaxing - amazing venue
5
This fantastic restaurant is situated at the top of the tallest Supertree at Gardens by the Bay. Went with a tour group so not sure of the cost. However the meal was delightful, with 4 small courses, all beautifully presented and delicious. The view from the tables is expansive. I would visit again on future Singapore visits
4
Slightly underrated in terms of entry but an amazing experience. If you want to dine in super tree grove which you must while waiting for the light show , then indo chine should be the only choice. The rooftop bar is nice and cosy and gives a great view of the garden , the ocean , marina bay Sansa , the Ferris wheel. On a breezy day it can be so much fun. 18 sgd cover charge is cheap and you get a beer or wine free. I am sure you will not end at one drink do bring it on It has some decent cocktails , I can recommend bourbon cocktail and vodka martini. They have a restaurant one level below but serve food up there also so make use of it. Menu is a great selection of gourmet meats and sea food. It is really nice
4
This presented an amazing view of Singapore, the harbour and Marina Bay surrounds. We went during the day and popped upstairs to the bar for a look (serving of drinks was closed) and then came downstairs for drink in the restaurant. We did ask for a menu to see lunch options but one was never produced. Service left a little to be desired but the outlook was great
2
Great views of the bay and the gardens from the rooftop bar. There is a $10 entrance fee, which is a bit steep. You do get a soft drink along with the $10, which is a ripoff. I get that they need some way to screen out people, but guests staying for lunch shouldn't need to pay $10 to enter. Lunch was overpriced and not very authentic Vietnamese. I'd know, I am Vietnamese and we had just returned from Saigon, Danang and Hoi An. The service was pretty average for the price. Lots of bored people standing around more focused with their cell phones. Overall, it's over rated.
5
A great way to see the unique buildings of Singapore, the harbour and beyond after enjoying the evening light show. The light show is best appreciated at ground level but then escape the crowds and enjoy a drink at this rooftop bar. Whilst the entry cost of $18 SGD seems step it does included a decent drink in a city where alcohol is expensive. An outstanding vantage point
3
Paying extra to go to the top where there is a bar was expensive for a one off experience, the view was good however there are other places with equally good views in my opinion, we were the only people at the top during our visit, so the added expense put many others off
5
This was beautiful to see, both day time and during the evening. I loved watching the light show from here.
5
This place is amazing. Structures built like very tall trees connected by an aerial walkway. Views from there are all superb. Go late in the day and be there at dusk when the free lightshow set to music starts. It really is magical
4
Really awesome view from the rooftop bar. Since it is in a SuperTree, the space in the restaurant is limited and the tables are arranged in a circular fashion. Nice place.
5
Simply great place to enjoy the evenings. Awesome rooftop bar with a panoramic view of harbour and city.
5
Just had appetizers and drink. $18 SD to get up to restaurant. That gets you a cocktail and the view. Food is extra. $10SD gets you up the tree and one soft drink. Roof top bar has no shade, so its too hot during the day, so plan an evening outing
4
Dined with my good friend after watching the Super Tree Groove light show, we went straight for our dinner up here afterwards. It's one of its kind dinning, you can't get in many places like this because of its location and its design, you see the gardens view, all lights lite up. We loved the ambiance. However the service was quite slow, we had to go up once to get a menu ourselves and have to wave down the staff a couple of times to get their attention when we needed service. Apart from that the food and drinks was wonderful.
5
We decided to visit the rooftop bar after watching the light show.You pay an entrance fee to go up but this includes your first drink, this is obviously to stop people from just going up to see the view and helps limit numbers.It is well worth it, you have a 360Â° view, stunning and there is a lovely breeze because it is completely open air, no cover.Great experience loved i
5
You can't help but smile when you see these at night, they are incredible. For $5 to go up to the walkways, it's cheap and you get the most amazing view. We went up the supertree during the day but also saw the trees at night, so beautiful
4
The view after dark is spectacular, and an evening that starts at the rooftop bar is almost guaranteed to be a great one. I was afraid this would be one of those places that trades off its location and view--it certain could--but the food is every bit as delightful as the view of the Singapore Flyer and skyline
4
Enjoyed a Wed. evening anniversary dinner and enjoyed it. Now the details which might help you...1) The food is good but not great and for the prices I thought it might have been a little bit better.2) The view. From the restaurant you get a nice view but it is not a fantastic view3) The seating. You either sit facing in or out so one of you is going to miss the view outside. I was on my anniversary so I already had a great view! :) There is a more intimate area with two tables for two but they are right by the elevator and I think leopard themed furniture is long out of date.Overall, a good bet for a tourist or an upscale-nice place but it is by no means "fancy" (shich could be an advantage). A bottle of wine and we ended up at $330. You be the judge.Highlight:Pass on the dinner and go straight to the top! The roof top bar is pricy-ish but casual and boasts a fabulous 360 view of the city! I'll be back..
4
Touristic place with a nice overview over the city. Value is more than ok with 10 S$ for a non-alc drink and a top 360° view
3
On top of one of the Supertree, location unbeatable, food acceptable and menu should be definitely updated, though the view is incredible
5
Amazing to see this tree during the evening during their light show and its open to public with out any fee. its very beautiful . Must visit place in Singapore.
4
Went for dinner at the Supertree. The lightshow in Supertree Grove was fantastic and having dinner on top of one of the trees is also a great experience. The food is good, especially the starter platter. Well presented and good service in a comfortable setting. However the thing that makes this place amazing is having a drink after dinner in the roof top bar. The cocktails were very good, the service is good, the bar is modern and comfortable only seating about 40, but the views across the city are worth the trip alone
4
A fantastic visual experience that can be view both day or night.By combining the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest experience you can see the trees in daylight and then return to see the nightly, free, light show.The queue to get tickets to the skywalk can be a bit tiresome and you then find yourself waiting again to ascend to the platform. The light show is very popular so get your tickets earier in the day
5
If you are visiting the Cloud Forest or Plant Dome, then make allowances to see this. The best time is to visit after dark as they do the most amazing light and sound show around the trees. It is very impressive and entertaining.Well worth taking the kids to see
5
WOW....walk out of the lift and it's all happening. Colours, view, retro furniture, great friendly staff, matched to a great menu and wines. You must spend $80 min but that's easy as you want to eat and drink it all.The calamari was crunchy and spicy, and chicken had a yummy filling. We shared a chocolate desert.It's a modern must for dining in Singapore, especially for couples. Leave room for a good night drink upstairs in the roof top bar...views are fa
4
You can get to the top of the "tree" by paying a fee. The amount depends on the time of the day you go. Till about 5pm you pay less than later . This is due to the type of beverage you can claim at the time. Tea & coffee is less than a beer
2
Having visited Indochina Waterfront in the past and always had a great experience, I decided to take the family for a drink and substantial snacks (no table available) at the branch in Gardens by the Bay. I should have realised something was amiss when there was an extra charge (S$18 net for adults and S$11 net for kids) just to go up though it did include a drink, which swung the balance. this was a mistake. When we got up there, we were presented with plastic menu similar to that you may receive in a basic cafe. There was a choice of two beer, Tiger and Heineken, but we were told we could not have these but only a second rate looking Germanic looking beer. A beer in most bars comes in at around $10, which is expensive even in a London book.We ordered snacks including spring rolls, deep fried squid and a minced chicken dish. All were disappointing. Too greasy and came with sauce from a bottle, which for S$18 a pop, made one feel violated to say the least. The group are not doing themselves any favours with this offering and I would advise going to the amazing Gardens by the Bay but keeping feet on the ground for the light show and bringing a picnic! There are much better views to be had in Singapore
5
A great location for a special occasion. Make sure you get there ahead of your table reservation to enjoy a drink from the bar on the top floor. The view captures the whole panorama of Singapore, from downtown, MBS and across to the flyer. It's one of our favourite views being set back from all the main landmarks. Dinner itself was then a great mixture of flavours. We had 4 starters and 4 mains between 3 of us and then took dessert each. In particular would recommend the Chilli squid and lychee pork from starters, but all our plates were delicious. Staff were friendly and didn't rush us, also more than happy to move our table back by 30mins for an extra drink on the roof bar beforehand. The only minor point from our visit was that the bar staff upstairs are a little slow/rushed to take orders for drinks (but then it was busy
5
What a great relaxing light and sound show inside Gardens of the Bay. This is a paid attraction but worth the pay for my wife and kid.
3
We only had one night in Singapore and we dinned here. Lovely views from the roof garden bar. Food good but a bit expensive for what it is. Staff friendly but an average experience overall.
5
This is a lovely restaurant located in one of the super trees at Gardens by the Bay. Delicious food, well priced, attentive staff and wonderful views.
3
While visiting Gardens By the Bay, I happened on Super Tree by IndoChine. It was a hot and humid day and I thought it would be worth the 10 Singapore dollars (about US $7.25) to go up to see the views and relax. The view was spectacular. The only drinks available when I was there were fruit juices, coffee, tea and sodas. Pretty expensive for a fruit juice, but the mango juice was fresh and tasted refreshing. There is a viewing level a couple of stories above the restaurant and bar. No food was being served when I was there. Downstairs where the elevator is located, there is a kind of museum with many different pictures and some local art work. It was a nice respite
5
We had been told that the Supertrees put on a light show each evening so we made a special trip to be there at night, and we were not disappointed. Although we were probably about a half a kilometre away, we could still see the amazing display that the supertrees offered. The show lasted for about a half an hour and it is well worth the effort to be there for the show
3
With friends visiting us from Sydney en route to Northern Europe, we wanted to take them out to dinner at an authentic Singaporean restaurant but also, take in some views. We decided on the Supertree bar in Gardens by the Bay. This was our second visit since arriving in Singapore in late January and again, we all enjoyed ourselves very much. Our Sydney friends had been feeling the heat and humidity a bit so the lovely breeze off the east coast along with the magnificent 360 degree views was a wonderful start to the evening. Our $18 per head entrance included a drink so we sipped those while chatting and admiring all around.From a service perspective, I had tried to book a table for us earlier in the week but was told that bookings weren't taken, it was first come first serve so to speak. Therefore, it was surprising that on arrival I saw tables with "reserved" signs on them. Also, after our first free drink, we were never visited again to see if we wanted another. I even had my empty glass taken away
5
After no responses from New Asia Bar, Equinox, Ce La Vie, I called and booked here at SuperTree by Indochine.They called me the morning of the day to reconfirm, were prepared for our arrival, had great suggestions for memorable pictures, wonderfully tasty food, great bar, everything that a special occasion requires!Highly recommended
4
Indochine has many venues in Singapore and my favourites are the one in Boat Quay and this one on Gardens @ the Bay by the Super Trees. The view from the circular bar on top is lovely at night. There's no need for reservations if you only want to stay at the bar. Entrance is $18 and entitles you to a drink upstairs. To dine in the restaurant reservations are a must. I love the fusion menu they offer with items to please anyone. A great way to see the Marina Bay Towers from behind
5
Paid to go up to the roof top where the views were amazing. Entrance entitles you to a cocktail or soft drink or beer. We decided to have lunch so went down to the next level to the restaurant where we had really interesting & enjoyable food. This is an amazing place & well worth paying to go up to
4
It is my first time to come here at night. The super trees are beautiful at night! Too bad we could not stay till 745pm to watch the lightings show. Admission is free. You do not need pay for OCBC skywalk to see these beautiful supertrees
5
Lots of beautiful spots for photos a lovely garden which is nice a great free attraction , make sure you go in the evening for the light show which is twice an evening with a music show , very lovely
4
These trees are cool looking during the day. But at sunset every night they do a music and light show which is just breathtaking. Lean back and enjoy. Do not try to film it as it will take away from they pleasure.
5
the SuperTrees were my favorit part of gardens by the bay! make sure you stay for the daily light shows you wont be disappointed
2
Food was all over the place as was service. Views are blocked by the weird design and wine overpriced. Not a place to go except for a quick novelty factor drink.
5
Such a nice place to have dinner. It is really a place where you can escape the crowded and vivid city and feel completely relax in a nice environment! The food is good, the people are nice and the view from the top bar is amazing..
4
As we were walking in the park, we planned to visit the super trees. There are 2 choices: 1) the super trees connected by walkway (entrance SIN 8) or the Indochine Supertree (which is 50 meter high and sticks out above the others), entrance fee SIN 10 which includes a free soft drink. There was a long cue for the supertrees connected by walkway, so we opted for the Indochine supertree. Staff was friendly and the view very nice. We visited around lunch but I would recommend to visit during sundown and have a drink on the rooftop bar, which has a 360 degree view
4
I wanted to surprise my partner for my 50th birthday, I hadn't planned anything for the night as I was not sure how good the roof top bar would be on top of the Super Tree,I wanted to get there before sunset and also before the tree show (even though we had seen it twice before), I knew the cost was 18 sgd to go to the top and receive a small drink as I always read the TA reviews before going somewhere.I was going to book dinner at the restaurant but changed my mind after reading the not so flattering reviews about the food and the fact they suggest you to book a week in advance on their website.We really enjoyed the view from the roof top bar and the drink was welcomed as we had walked from The Mandarin Oriental in long pants and shirts (I know but I thought it would be dressier).The Staff were ok, not overly friendly, if not for the view I wouldn't go back
4
The view from the top of the SuperTree is great and it's much better to go up there and enjoy a couple of drinks rather than pay the entrance fee. Food was expensive though, we ended up just having some snacks and getting dinner somewhere else. Best to go there during sunset.
3
We ate in the restaurant and the service was poor from the minute we walked in the door. The food was of the same high quality I was used to in other Indochine restaurants. After dinner we moved to the rooftop bar where the view was spectacular. However the service was no better and other than the first drink when we arrived we sat with empty glasses for well over 30 min before we decided to leave. They obviously didn't want our money. Still the food was fantastic and the view makes it well worth the visit.
1
What a disappointment! Such an incredible location for a restaurant but very poor dining experience. The evening started on a high in the top of the supertree with cocktails overlooking the gardens, very pleasant experience We then made our way down to the restaurant which had no more than 4 tables dining, at the time I thought this was very odd being in such a prime location and at peak time however it wasn't long before we found out why...As it was a special occasion we ordered a bottle of champagne, we were immediately told by our waitress that they have no champagne available, 12 different bottles on the menu and not one available?? We opted for the sparkling water instead Similar issues arose with our food order with many unavailable dishes We eventually completed an order with crispy prawns, rice paper rolls and some mixed gourmet meats, pork Loin and Vietnamese beef. What a disappointment, prawns with soggy and mushy, certainly not crisp and the mains were bland and tough.To top it off A minimum spend of $80 per head is required to dine in this restaurant, perhaps to compensate for their lack of customers...
3
$ 18 to go up by elevator. Nice roof top bar, had to wait for 45 minutes to get my free drink or paid drink, service is ok. good if you are on date. nothing else except view. as couple visit
1
Have a drink upstairs but avoid the restaurant. Service is non existing. Food takes one and a half hour.
5
I had no idea what to expect (okay, I admit, I had not done my homework), but when I arrived at the park and saw these super trees, I was blown away. They're a must for anyone who visits Singapore!
1
We are visiting from California so our friends took us to this once because he thought it will be a wonderful experience. The view is nice but good is below average. I would say it's the worst food for whole lot of money. We ordered a bottle of cheap wine for 105 dollars. It needed to breathe a little but our waiter started to pour into our glasses right away while my husband was trying to tell him to wait. My husband and friend ordered lemongrass sea bass and I ordered tiger prawn and pomelo salad while other friend ordered Vietnamese style beef. I almost fell out of my chair when I saw my salad. It said tiger prawn but it was more like kitten shrimp. I m not joking about the size of three shrimp that as in the salad. When I questioned the size after I saw someone next to me ordering different tiger prawn dish which was decent size, they said because mine was salad. Sure, since I must look stupid that I should accept that answer. The dressing on the salad did not go well with pomelo since it was Vietnamese fish sauce dressing. With most being the pomelo, and the small portion I still couldn't finish it because it was so salty and overwhelming smell of fish sauce. When it was time for our check, they informed us we need to spend 70 more dollars since it's required to spend at least 80 per person. Since we know the quality of the food and the taste, our guys decided in couple of cognacs which was 28 dollars each. It must have been a joke because the serving size was a barely a sip. I understand that they must have to pay high rent to charge so much but the serving sizes there was a joke as well as the waiters and rest of the working staff. They were not trained to recommend or tell us about the spending until we got the check, they didn't know who ordered what so they try to give me my husbands dish, they were not informed about the wine to let it breathe, trying to explain why my tiger prawn was so small compare to other people's tiger prawns dish by telling me because mine was a salad. The service staff isn't well trained for the place where they charge so much money for not so edible good. Do not waste money for it really isn't worth it even for the view

Ate here for dinner during a recent biz trip to Singapore. The food was quite lovely and you simply cannot beat the view (be sure to go to the rooftop bar!!!!). Service was a bit lacking, but not too bad. All of the seafood dishes were very tasty. Would certainly go here again. Be sure to get a reservation
2
I visited the restaurant on a very special occasion (my brother's birthday) but the food was a huge disappointment. Dish after dish. The only saving grace was the view. On the bright side, the bar on the rooftop, is not bad at all! Though I must agree that the bar could be done up more nicely, other than that, the view at the top of the supertree will leave you speechless, lost for words and wanting to explore this beautiful country even more
4
Wow. Dinner in a giant Avatar tree. Amazing viewed from the ground and a truly spectacular view of the gardens and city lights from the roof top bar. Fantastic Chinese meal in metal canopy of the Supertree. My friends and I enjoyed everything we ordered especially the lamb cutlets.
5
Wow this was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore - situated at the top of the Supertrees 50 metres from the ground. It took a few nights to finally get a table - well worth the wait. It was such a unique experience dining at the top of the Supertrees. Service, food, decor and the views were excellent - although the final bill for two was very overpriced - but that's what it's like in Singapore in general. We went up to the rooftop bar after dinner and another wow - 360-degree views of the city which were spectacular, as most of city was ablaze with pretty lights
4
This is a lot better than the Marina Bay Sands. Not as crowded and a truly fantastic view - which includes the Sands itself! It's not cheap but it's a great experience, and I don't think I've seen a better night-time rooftop bar view anywhere. Strongly recommended
4
After a walk around all the trees at ground level and then along the high walkway, we popped up for a drink at the top of the IndoChine SuperTree. The $18 entry included a beer, wine or selected spirit. It was a lovely evening and so we had our one drink checking out the amazing 360o view. Great way to start our evening
5
It's better to go there in the evening to enjoy the lighting. Huge area to laze around with the kids as well.
5
What a great surprise we had when the trees lit up at 7pm and the lightshow began. We laid on our backs on the cool round benches and enjoyed an awesome 20 minute show!
5
I don't know how tall this tree it but it's looks like a tree from another planet. When I was there I feel like that's the tree of the future generation. It's just amazing!
5
This is a very beautiful sight in the night when the lights are up. In the evening when the temperature is lower and the weather is cooler, this is a scenic spot to hang out.
5
hey , its only $5 for the OCBC SKY . after visiting the two domes , its also a best idea to end up with seeing the night view of marina bay sand and garden bay the bay . its quit crowd that time and ticket for this tower is sold out , but yet we still manages to buy the last one .. hahaha
2
I have wanted to try the super tree for years. The view is amazing and the trees are spectacular. But the service is awful and the food ordinary. And for a restaurant like this the wine list is ordinary too. Don't bother with the restaurant - just go to the bar for the experienc
5
I have lunch at the restaurant . The food was very good but the service so slow .from roof top you guys can see the view so beautiful. Should book table in advance . If not arrival there pay for entrance fee with included drink alcohol =18$ sin non alcohol = 10$ sin
5
These trees are truly unique amazing by day but awesome by night. The vieiews from the top are great good panoramic views of the harbour with no skyscrapers in the way. A little on the expensive side but worth it. Good to combine with gardens by the sea as so near
1
Tried to pay 18 dollars each at gateway, cashier couldn't change a fifty dollar note, had to pay by card in the end. Got to top after searching for stairs or elevator as the cashier forgot to tell us where to go. Finally in Restuarant wandered around until firmly told to sit down before they would serve us!Don't recommend at all don't bother.Oh for $18 this is what you get
4
That's amazing to be on top of the highest Supertree at Gardens by the Bay. The view is extraordinary, above all at night with MBS on one side and all the boats illuminating the sea on the other. Being on the rooftop in the evening is very refreshing, there is a nice breeze even when it's still stuffing on the ground level.To enjoy the light show, I recommend you go one level below at the Restaurant (min 80SGD/person). You can't see anything from the rooftop. This is disappointing.Regarding food, it's average. A sort of Asian fusion. Not very spicy, not highly tasty, not as crispy as named, but not as bad as you could fear from such a touristic place. In a nutshell, it is good enough. Anyway, you came to enjoy the view, not for the food :-
4
With drinks reasonably priced, this rooftop bar gives you a 360 degrees view of Singapore. Quality of the drinks can be improved though.
5
With view to Marina Bay Sand, you cannot miss this attraction. Suggested visit during evening to appreciate lights and landscapes.
4
Lying on the ground and watching the SuperTree changing colors and dancing to the tune is relaxing. If you want some quite time alone or with family this will be loved
5
I had read about this 'tree' but seeing it lit up at night with its kaleidescope of chaning colours and patterns was simply stunning, The sculptures are huge and spectacular. Another 'must see' when visiting Singapore.
4
Interesting light show. Wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly pleased. Very colorful light show with music that was well synchronized with the trees glowing. All part of the regular admission. It was raining when we were there. Hot and muggy. Had some appetizers and drinks at Bakerzin within walking distance of the Supertrees
4
Well, a very cozy place to just chill out and talk to friends. The music is not loud so you don't need to shout in order to converse with friends. Marina Bay Sands adds to the scenic paradise of the lighted garden. This is of course best experienced at night
4
Nice meal. Surroundings were unique. Pricey for Thai food. Spent $700.Roof bar would not serve us tap water with our drinks which is unusual in SG. We call it 'iced water". I can understand if we just went to the bar and wanted free hydration but we did spend $700 on food and a beverage each. Would have stayed longer but the waiter was very mater of fact. Service was extremely slow. Had our one drink and left
4
Start with cocktails on the rooftop overlooking the Bay and Marina Bay resort. Then downstairs to the restaurant. At Indochina a great selection of starters is available - so good company, drinks, and loads of snacks - this makes for a great night. One you're finished round it off with coffee or night caps back up on the rooftop. A bit pricey though as there is a $18 entrance to the rooftop befor you start and food and drink not cheap because of the settin
2
Went with family to Gardens at the Bay (must see) and due to our last minute planning, was only able to get seating at the rooftop bar. Hostess(using that term very loosely) knew our kids wanted to see the light show, BUT didn't inform us that we could only see the light show from the restaurant. Had to pay an $18 cover charge (1 drink from limited menu) just to go up. View was very nice, but some glass wind guards would have been nice. Waiter seated us without asking what we wanted. Seemed like he was more keen to chat with his fellow waiters by the bar. Bartender was eating some roti type of stuff, so rather unappealing, knowing he was mixing our drinks( did he wash his hands?) We asked to see the food menu and we ordered from the menu (mainly fried stuff). All the food was cold when we got it and the last appetizer came only after we reminded the manager. Waiter was still chatting at bar and never came over once to see if we wanted any more drinks or if everything was alright. While we were waiting for our last appetizer to arrive, we noticed other tables were ordering from the restaurant menu, When I flagged our waiter and asked if we came too early to order from the restaurant menu, he said we had to specifically ask for it as they don't "like" serving dinners at the small tables. Personally, I think he was too lazy to carry up the trays. Deceptive hostess, bad waiter, mediocre cold food and expensive. The manager was the only professional person in the whole place. Don't waste your money and hope they replace venue with a restaurant operator that can give the space the quality it deserves. What a shame Indochine is wasting the space
3
We went for lunch and the restaurant was empty ,just 5 people .The waiters have not been smiling and looked quite bored .We all were seated not in very good tables ,the other side of the tree would have been with a better view but no one complained .Very expensive for what you get ,our soft shell crab was too soggy and full of sauce that had not much flavour .We had no desserts as they did not sound great .Remember you will have to pay to go up even if you do not want to eat ,included with the lift use you can chose between soft drinks or wine that you can still drink with your lunch .There certainly is better in the area 
1
I was wondering why did you guys remove my review. This is the second time Tripadvisor has removed my reviews, first time in December 2015 and the latest review was a few days ago. Visitors deserve to know how poor the service is.
4
Definitely visit the SuperTrees during the day & night time for a light show. It kinda feels like a whole new Disney land. Very surreal.
4
Probably not known by many tourists, nice top of the tree bar with outstanding 360 views of Singapore. Entrance of sgd 18 includes a drink, which is acceptable for Singapore standards. Was not crowded and good service.
5
This is my third time I have visit these trees and it is very nice to see that trees become more real! I hope for the next few year, all the tree will be cover by green leafs.
5
You have to pay $18 each to enter, which entitles you to a glass of wine or spirits.The view is spectacular!! The food was delicious.
5
It's a fantastic restaurant with a fantastic view. It's up in a tree and at night there's a light show and it has an amazing terrace. The food is beautiful. A fantastic restaurant!😀🌲
5
A must see. Spend a day into the evening so you get both views. Shows and singing going on. Very entertaining. Good food. Best mango and lime ice cream I ever tasted.
5
If you want to relax with a cold beer and take in the colourful night time scene in the waterfront you won't do much better than this. You pay an entry fee but get a free drink with it, and considering the surroundings it was good value. Not for those afraid of heights
3
To be fair, we went at 8.30 on a Sunday evening but it definitely felt like the staff just wanted to go home. The food was OK but service was terrible with only 1 or 2 waiting staff who spent most of the evening chatting. The bar on the roof however is very cool and definitely worth a trip
4
We love to go here for a sunset drink and nibble. The view is spectacular and the service is always very good. Its fun to watch the Super tree light show from up above the crowds as well (I think it starts at 7:40). You have to pay a fee to get up to the roof, but it includes one drink. The food is very good, but may not be suitable for picky, Western eaters. We love both spring rolls and my daughter always gets the truffle fries
4
Worth a visit for the view on the 15th floor (I believe?)
The cost to do this is $18 each, but this includes a drink.
A good opportunity to take some nice photos.
It can be quite windy up there!
1
Amazing view, amazing food and wonderful service. Thank you Daniel for saving the table we requested to enjoy the fireworks!!
5
This sight is lovely to view by day and by night.We enjoyed the night views as the day light was subsiding and lights were gradually becoming brighter.
5
Carols, fake snow and so many enthusiastic people. Loved the atmosphere. Great place to chill with friends or family.

At the Gardens by the Bay, the latest tree hosts a restaurant and a roof top bar. Absolutely stunning birds eye view of the gardens, Marina Bay Sands, the cruise centre, that Wheel, Esplanade at sunset. $18 to enter with a drink to go to the roof top on the 17 th floor or dine at 15-16th floor. The roof top is windy at times and could blow off your hat, and your wine glass. A bit short staffed at the bar, the finger food offered are fantastic. Try to get into the fine dining area, cosy and classy, food served well presented and immaculate service. We had a blast
3
Unfortunately, our visit to the Gardens by the Bay was accompanied by a downpour of rain. We therefore took shelter in the Super Tree. There was a cover charge to get it. This included one drink, which was in keeping with the prices of other tourist attractions in Singapore. Despite the rain the view from inside was stunning. We enjoyed our drink and had a great view of the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands. The decor inside is now looking a little jaded. It would definitely benefit from being renovated. We only had drinks so can't comment on the food.A good place to visit on a dry day- the outside platform offered a great view even on such a damp day
1
Six of us came here for dinner and drinks and were left utterly disappointed in every way. As soon as you walk in to get the elevator you're greeted by a hideous display rack of random ceramic dishes and scuffed black walls like this was the bleakest bargain basement kitchen store in existence. I suppose the ambiance was hidden beneath the crushed hopes of the people that have been here before us.The restaurant itself is run down, tacky and cheaply decorated. The only redeeming factor was the rooftop bar where you can enjoy an unobstructed view of the skyline, but unfortunately that's when things got nasty.We ordered a flaming Lamborghini for our friend and the manager on duty, Firdaus, couldn't get it to light up properly because of the wind. We asked him to try again and, according to him, it took four shots to get it to work. No word from him that we could have done it downstairs inside the restaurant to avoid the wind or even a polite warning that this drink would end up costing $91 with the extra shots. When we asked him about the insane bill he immediately got aggressive and spat out, "you want me to call the police?" How is this man even in the service industry with that kind of attitude? We'd already spent nearly $700 at the restaurant anyway so we were totally prepared to get ripped off some more, but we weren't ready to get rudely shouted at on top of everything else. This is honestly one of the worst places I have ever been to in Singapore. Please avoid
2
Great views, but crazy over priced. 3 euro bottler of wine priced at 80 dollars (the cheapest wine). Its more a novelty restaurant instead of a fine dining location. The bar ontop is great, with great views. Expensive drinks.Its tourist area, so i suppose things will be expensive. The food was ok, nothing exceptional at all. 2stars for the for the venue.
2
Paid $10 for a non-alcoholic beverage plus entrance to the top of this super tree. My friend paid $18 for an alcoholic beverage. It's pricey. The strange decor of vases and pottery greeted us after we past the terribly curt service staff at the entrance who had no smiles and can't be bothered. I wonder why such a "greeter" was placed at the entrance. The lift smelled terrible! It was like an old musty almost toilet smell. Possibly cos sweaty chefs (not their fault) and ingredients like seafood are also being transported via this single lift. The chef who shared our lift was very courteous. Kudos to him. The other wait staff in the lift, not at all. We arrived on the 16th floor and were told we can only sit in a confined "bar stool" area. It was sunny and we couldn't find a spot. The waiter was inattentive and busy chatting with other staffs. We were shoved a drinks menu. We asked what beer there was. Suddenly they jittered amongst themselves. And one of the waiters told us, the roof top is now open. We can go there if we like. There were already several guests there drinking and some leaving. So I don't understand the meaning of "now open". Seemed the rooftop was already opened earlier. Anyway we sat and ordered drinks. There's only 2 types of generic bottled beer to choose from. Certainly doesn't worth $18. For the non-alcoholic drink, I asked if it came in a can. He said yes. But later it was just a glass. Seemed less than a can. He didn't seem to understand English so well, so forget it. The view isn't bad but service is terrible. Even the roof top had a strange fried food smell seeping from the wooden planks. I'm not impressed. Choose $10 entrance + 1 drink (until 6pm) if you want to enjoy the view. But I wouldn't dine there, indochine isn't famed for either food or service and it costs way too much. Wouldn't do it again.
4
Tallest tree in the park with a small bar at the top. Cost you min $10 to access but you get a soft drink included, for a bit more you can get a beer instead. View from top has 360 deg views. There is a restaurant in this attraction but didn't visit it
2
The place is too cramp. Is like dining along a balcony. Service was not good. Food was so average. Décor was unimpressive. What a waste in a unique location and structure.
4
The only plus point is the view, the food is average & the dining area is very cramp, not good for big group. Hosted a group of 40pax, the seating arrangement sucks!
4
Good to meet friends, chill and relax over glass of wine and unwind on a Friday evening.... not advised for rainy days though.
3
if ur into the atmosphere, this is a pretty cool place. food-wise, it's acceptable.. went for the experience, would't go again.
5
I love this place that I join as a member in 2015. I can visit as many times as I like within a year. I get discount too at the food outlets.
5
After a tired walk in the garden, you may consider take a break here. Chatting and drinking while enjoying the view.
5
In this place we saw a bunch of orchids and a tree that was planted in honor of the late SG leader and a father Lee Kuan Yew. Together with a friend, I really enjoy my travel in this place. So magnificent and very relaxing even it was hot when we were there
5
The lights and music at the light show are just stunning! These trees are the most gorgeous man-made thing Ive ever seen. The light shows at 7.45pm and 8.45pm are free and a must do! Try and arrive at least 20mins before the show and find a seat below one of the smaller trees that are facing the three main big trees in the center. I didn't do the skywalk, but wished I had, it looked great
4
Dinner in the tree tops was lovely. Not a good place to watch the light show but spectacular views of the city from the wine bar on the next floor up. The food was amazing but extremely expensive. Wine prices were ridiculous - but that's Singapore. You are paying a huge premium for the location but there is not a great benefit to being up there as you cannot see the light show from the restaurant and need to go up stairs for the view. I also don't think the service was up to fine dinning standards
4
The dinner ambience was lovely to have a great view from the tree top at night. I really couldn't remember how the food taste like so I guess wasn't as impressive but not too bad either. Only one thing is the reflection from the window glass with the lights, that kind of created the difficulty of the view
3
Went to indochine to dine in with my friend. The view is astonishing from the top. We had dinner but the food was not that sumptous to taste, the price is ok. The service is average.
5
Brilliant idea and set up, super cool views and surrounded by modernity and nicely executed attraction.. Congratulations to the team who had this great idea and thanks for allowing us to see it
5
Wow no words to explain. Must visited place in Singapore and very good place to have to spend the evening with friends.
3
The trees reminded us of Avatar, they were neat to see and fairly inexpensive but nothing crazy. At night we saw the light show from our hotel and that was pretty amazing.
3
Good service and a great view. Fun in the botanical garden BUT our meal was only fair. The bar above the restaurant is a fun place.
5
The light show was amazing, the music was fantastic, people were so happy, it was so exciting, we loved ever minute of this light display
5
We got our concierge at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to make a reservation for us. Reservation is definitely required as the restaurant is rather small. The staff were attentive and gave us recommendations. They also suggested to reduce the serving on the seafood platter to 2 persons (as the menu stated for 4) when we remarked that it would be too large a portion for us. Food is fitting for health conscious persons as there are healthy options which taste very fresh
3
Light show, ambience and view were very very good. Food was okay, nothing special but serviceable. Service was very ordinary. Handed wine list waited 15-20 minutes for order to be taken. Entrees arrived at various times. Mains, five of them arrived pretty much at the same time, the last main was at least 10-15 minutes away. Then we had a very long break till anyone came near the table. When asked for dessert menu's we were given two to share amongst six of us. Ordered a dessert wine, then told later they had none. $ 760 for six of us which included two bottles of wine. Could have been special but didn't quite get there. Upstairs in the bar, view even better. So if u dine at the restaurant, make sure u visit the bar for a drink or just the view before leaving. U can also walk around the restaurant from the outside
3
When you pay S$10 for 2 soft drinks in advance , enter a rather basic lift and are shown into strange 'destination' restaurant with appalling design and decor you might well question the food at the 'Gardens by the bay' version of Indochine.Our two salads were actually very good , tasty, interesting and hit the spot !First impressions are not always the best 
4
Visited here whilst at gardens by the bay and the view was fantastic. we ordered a small dish of Vietnamese hand rolls and they were very nice. The stairway and elevator looked a bit rundown and could do with a renovation. worth a visit just for the views at night
5
light show was amazing and gardens are amazing There are food outlets and restaurants there and don't miss the indoor gardens with the sky walk truly amazing
5
The Super tree(s) came to life with the free light & music show, on every night from 7,45. Transformed from an engineering marvel to a magical masterpiece. Lovely to relax & reflect on a balmy evening after a warm day in the Gardens,
5
Visited the light show. It's the best place to be in evening. Chinese Orchestra played some nice renderings. Light show was superb.
5
so nature beautiful place , beautiful flowers love to come here when you come to Singapore plz come here
3
This restaurant is in a fantastic position in the Gardens by the Bay at the wonderful Supertree. If only the dining experience matched up to its surroundings. Overall the level of service was poor. we were left for long periods without seeing any staff. The food though quite tasty was look warm. I had ordered a hot plate with beef and chilli. Unfortunatley it had long lost it's sizzle by the time it got to our table. At the end of the meal we had coffee on the roof terrace, after we settled the account and left. At the elevator I was stopped and told by the waiter that i had not paid for our coffees. As we had just paid the bill I accompanied him back to the till where the manager told him the coffees had been paid for. This is not what I expect from a restaurant that charges a minimum payment of S$80 per person. Overall very dissapointing
1
I took my Wife here for a special birthday dinner and could not have been more disappointed. Fell so far below our expectations. The decor was awful, with an eclectic mix of cow hide, disco balls and neon lights, but the food worse. Avoid at all costs and instead just head for the roof bar which offers a great view of MBS and the city.
2
We were very much looking forward to dinner at SuperTree by Indochine, and I have to say, we were very disappointed. The food and service was very ordinary, and the dinner was very expensive. I don't mind paying high prices for wonderful restaurant experiences, but the only thing worth mentioning for this restaurant is the view!Pay $18 a head and just have a drink at the roof top bar instead!
5
The first advice I will give is to make a reservation to this restaurant so you don't have to pay to ride the elevator up. We didn't and had to pay $10 each to ride up. The views were spectacular and the food was excellent but pricey. I would dine here again
2
The view is amazing since the restaurant area is on level 16. However this is not a place i would revisit because the food is terrible. We had the scallops and lobsters and pan seared fish for the mains. The sauces which was supposed to be tamarind/asian fusion didnt work well with the seafood.The plating was also very random with the cashew nuts. And because there is a minimum spending of at least $80/pax, it was easily above $200 for the food we had (as per pictures). The money can definitely get us better food elsewhere.
1
We were trying to dine at Pollen, but were told they were having an event tonight and wouldn't be able to seat us. The hostess recommended Supertree Indochine. What a mistake! First, we were annoyed that you have to pay $18SD just to get up to the place. We were told you can either pay minimum $80SD per person (!!!) to have the full restaurant experience, or go to the bar for tapas. We chose the latter. The view was nice, but the food menu was very limited and the drinks were very average. Service was horrible. We had to ask for water, we ordered vegetarian spring rolls but were given chicken instead. My husband took a bite, not knowing they had mixed up the order, and was sick the rest of the night. When the waiter brought new rolls, he acted like nothing had happened. My husband asked to clarify that they had in fact mixed up the order, and the waiter mumbled a vague apology as he walked away. When we were given the bill, my husband mentioned to the server what had happened with the spring rolls, but he just looked at us blankly and didn't respond. We ended up paying the bill in full, which was just unacceptable given our experience, and they include a 10% tip to themselves in the bill. Also, the atmosphere was really touristy, filled with people taking selfies the whole time. AVOID
5
I enjoyed this place alot. It was just futuristic and anything that supports plants over concrete I'm down for. So definitely give it a chance if you are visiting.
5
This is at the garden at the bay and post 7pm there is a free show..with music and lights it is beautiful and a must visit for tourists can be visited the same day as garden at bay
5
These are really cool art structures and you can take a stroll on the "Skywalk" for $5. Go at night when the trees are lit up.
2
The view is great and the food was OK but the service is truly appalling. They just don't seem to try very hard. Very over priced for the experience. Note there is a minimum charge which is quite high.
4
Stopped in for beers and the view - a very special spot amongst the amazing architecture and gardens - unexpected highlight of fireworks at eye level - haze was cleared by the breeze briefly - well worth a visit!
5
I have been to this attraction (by the Gardens) twice now about 1-2 years apart and I can see the foliage growing into the superstructure. It is amazing now (especially lovely at night when 'trees' are lit) and will only get better through the years.
5
This is a trendy place in the Gardens by the Bay to enjoy some drinks while observing a fantastic view of Marina Bay. The famous Sands hotel is just opposite the bar, the SkyFlyer, the bay itself and all those banks and businedd skyscrapers. Very nice
3
We decided to dine here as, it was a unique restaurant. The view is wonderful but sadly the wow factor ends here. The food is overpriced and average. The service was poor. There were four tables occupied but you waited ages for anyone to come. The interior is rather shoddy. Disappointing!!
2
Recently we attended this restaurant and we were very disappointed. We had made a booking for an early seating at 6 pm and although no one mentioned anything to us - we understood that there was likely to be another booking after us. They did advise there was a minimal charge per person of $86 Sing dollars.We arrived on time and they seemed to have lost our booking. They took a while to find us seating and get us settled in. Than they left us with an IPAD to sort our our order with little or no explanation.Once we had made our selection they came out and suggested that maybe we should have our starter's with our main meal. We declined this suggestion. We were still eating our starter's and the main turned up. Half way through our main they asked if we wanted desert.The food as it came out was very tasty and the view as the night got darker was terrific. However at 7.30 they came out and told us we would have to move upstairs if we wanted desert. This was the first mention of a time limit!!We declined - got our bill - which was wrong!! - paid and left.Over the years I have eaten at various IndoChine restaurants and always loved the experience. This was a big disappointment.Most places that have more than once seating in a night are usually very clear in their communication and slick in their management - in that way each time slot gets to enjoy their meal and eating experienc
3
This is a mixed review as the restaurant had some positives and negatives.On a positive note, the location is lovely. It's nice to wander about Gardens By The Bay and then go up 58metres to this restaurant in one of the lit up "trees". When I made my reservation, the person spent an inordinate amount of time reiterating that the minimum spend is SGD 80 per person. I indicated no problem, but he kept repeating the point. On the day of my booking I arrived to find that my reservation had been lost. The lovely lady downstairs confirmed I'd be welcome anyway, although I then had to leap through more hoops and more staff to actually be led to a table.I ordered the Vietnamese Rice Paper Rolls With Tiger Prawns as a starter. They were definitely fresh, but the lack of any herbs meant they were fairly bland - really nice dipping sauce though.For mains I ordered the Lemon Juice Marinated Chicken Mince with Pine Nuts. I was served a chicken thigh and wing ... after failing to get someones attention to question it, I ate anyway and it was fine. Not great, not bad, but just not what I had expected. When my server removed my plate (including my entree plate which was inexplicably still on my table), he mumbled something about telling the chef.Dessert was a simple, but well done, sticky rice with lovely fresh mango. The coconut cream was just the right amount and a good way to finish my meal.When I received my bill I was charged for the more expensive main I had received rather than the one I had ordered, but dessert was complimentary. No explanation was forthcoming, but I left it at that. All in all, an average meal with average service. I'm glad I went to satisfy my curiosity but don't expect to return any time soon. The staff told me the restaurant was always busy and I had the impression that this meant the little details really didn't matter as they were fully booked regardless

I guess most patrons come here for the good view. Otherwise I don't find the food any spectacular. Fairly forgettable. Service was average and price slightly steep.

We went to the light show on the last night of our trip and just loved it. It was just wonderful to sit and see the display and there music to the show was very good too.
5
These are so beautiful at night when they light up. My kids enjoyed looking at them in the day time and at night.
4
I watched the SuperTree light show which started about 9pm and ran for 15 minutes. The display of lights on different trees spaced around the area and the accompanying music were very enjoyable and I think a must see.
5
Spectacular structures on the skyline near or far. Great skywalk with views of the city and fabulous night show of lights and music suitable for the whole family. Definitely check it out! Loved it!

This restaurant looks good and is sited in a lovely space. The welcome was friendly and we were quickly seated. We ordered our meals and were given some complimentary bean things, not sure what they were; they were not to our liking, but others may like them. We ordered drinks which arrived promptly. From there it was all down hill. I ordered beef brisket on noodles, but the meat was so fatty I couldn't eat it and the noodles were a glutenous mass - all joined together. My husband had ordered the same meal but with stir fry beef strips - he found the meat tough and the noodles were the same. We left most of our meals. They did come with Miso soup which was nice

SuperTree by Indochine has got to be the one of the most unique bar locations in the world. I can't classify it as a rooftop bar because it is not a building. The closest category will be treetop bars if there is such a thing in the first place. But Indochine had to do one better, the bar has to be on top of a super tree. Well, I brought some overseas friends there for some drinks and to have a view of Singapore night skyline. The view was amazing, my friends were blown away. I, myself, was jaw-dropped too. Any comments about the bar? Not really, similar to any other bars. I'm probably biased in this aspect because when you are there, you are totally immersed in the amazing 360 degrees view around you. Thus, whatever they serve don't really matter. In the night, the supertrees have glowing blue neon lights. My friends did mention that they felt they were like in the movie Avatar, just chilling on top of tree. Ah yes! I found a category to classify this particular bar. I would group it under Avatar Bars! It is a great place for lovebirds or tourists to chill after a long day.Hope you enjoyed my review

Like others here we hadn't intended to dine but we'd skipped lunch and thought it looked rather special. It is in terms of location and views, on the largest of the "trees" erected as a spectacle in the beautiful tropical gardens of Marina Bay.The food is not exactly typical for the region, offering a slightly different slant to the standard fare. The pomelo and prawns salad was offered in mild, medium and spicy. We chose spicy with the promise of some chili fire to liven the tastebuds as a starter, but these was no chili at all. We mentioned that to the young waitress who seemed to think it was very funny that we had been given a surprise! We liked it, but it wasn't what was promised. The organic brown rice was delicious, as was the cod. The pork was rather ordinary.All in all, a pleasant meal with a decent bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and an expresso each to follow, which came to S$340. A bit steep, frankly, for 2 people without a sweet, but you're really paying for the view, which as night fell and the surrounding town was lit up, is really rather spectacular
4
I was not planning to eat here today, but but was walking through the Supertree Grove and discovered I was thirsty. I went up for a drink and asked to see the menu (delivered on an iPad) and decided to try the duck with organic brown rice. It was delivered in a timely manner and was really tasty and reasonable value for money. I would loved to have come here and dined during the light show in the evening, that would have rendered the great views here spectacular. Well worth a visit
5
The tree top walk ($5) had no waiting line at all during the day. Loooong line in the evening. Make sure you catch the 7.45 or 8.45pm light and sound show. Maybe combine visit with dinner at 'Satay by the Bay'. Follow the signs in garden; about 10 mins walk away
4
I'm only there for drinks but the ambiance is nice. It is very relaxing at the roof top.
Cons: the drink choices are pretty limited.
5
This Super Giant Tree is locate near Garden by The Bay.....you must visit this place at night because there will be lights and music...
2
Waiter service almost non existent. Food is dazzling. Food either arrives instantly or after an hour. The silly iPads (to order food) are hard to operate and make no sense. Staff are generally invisible. View is great.
5
Everything was thought with the lowermost detail! Gorgeous, the size of a giant, and sustainable! One of the wonders of Singapore!
3
Had lunch here, go here for the view. Food was standard, if brave enough try the open balcony. But considering the view this is worth it.
The payment to get up here is offset by one free drink.
5
The SuperTree are stunning. Best seen at night when lit up the 'trees' are amazing. They are a series of constructions with an overlay of plants and lighting. More beautiful than it sounds.
5
This place at night just took my breath away. Quite sureal just before Christmas with people singing carols in the warm evening air.
2
This restaurant is too expensive for the average quality food it gives. I went there for luch with my family, and we were disappointed>The food is out of prices and you are still hungry after eating, the juices are bought in a supermarket. the service is awful, no smile, no "hello", nothing to help the client. The only good point is the atmosphere
1
We were at Indochine at close to 6 pm for dinner and realized we were the only ones around... the food is above average esp the hotplate kurobuta but a little too salty (or maybe its due to the MSG that caused us to feel really thirsty now). We left at 7ish 8 and realized the restaurant is not full unlike the last time when we dined there.. they have many areas that they can improve on to attract and retain customers...1. Hygiene was questionable as the table runner and table mats were dirty with crumbs and stains.. The restrooms were dirtier than the public restrooms at Gardens by the Bay. Our public restroom attendants are amazing!2. Service by the crew was passable though the waitress could serve us drinks faster and be a little more attentive3. Horrible service rendered by the manager: we ordered many dishes (12 orders in total) so we only placed orders for 2 bowls of rice... they scooped the rice for us from a rice serving bowl so we didnt know that we will be charged for 3 bowls of rice instead of 2. We did not ask for refills and in fact I accepted only a small portion of rice when the waitress served me, The extra bowl costs $4, only 1% of our bill but it gave me a surprise and I merely asked the waiter to check the bill. The manager Paul came over and told us that they should charge us 5 bowls of rice instead since there were 5 of us so charging us 3 is already lenient of them. He added that if we want the rice in small bowls we have to specify. He took my husband's credit card before I can react and charged us the bill. When I recovered from his brash response I asked him if he thinks it is okay to charge customers what they did not order, he replied no. Any honest person will know that its wrong yet he knowingly treats customers that way... time to improve on customer service
3
Free to look at, but not particularly interesting from the ground, a though there is a suspended walk way (charge) between a few of them. Where these are most spectacular are at night when there's a light & sound show, although you can't quite see all of them, but it's FRE
5
A visit to this site was one of the highlightsof the trip, entry is free and the evening light show is nothing short of magnificent.
4
Awesome 360 degree view. Drink and finger food OK. A bit pricy though, but overall, worth the visit.
5
Well worth the fee to go up to the top as wonderful views of Singapore. Basic fee gives a nice soft drink. Pay a little more and get an alcoholic one
2
We just visited to the roof top bar for a drink and a bite to eat. The view is nothing short of spectacular. The drink included in the $18 entry fee was limited to 1/2 pint of draught beer, house wine and spirits - but worth it one time for the view. Do not bother ordering any food - it was terrible. The Vietnamese spring rolls were okay, but the two hot dishes we ordered came out cold - we sent them back and they came out again after being put into the microwave as the food was now dry and rubbery. We told the waiter, how said he'd inform the chef - how generous! I will not ever return, and since the food came from the Indochine kitchen below, I will be avoiding that restaurant too! Overall, poor service, terrible food, overpriced drinks - nice view

After having great experiences in the past at Supertree my wife and I took my Sister from NZ for an experience.We were told when booking that the restaurant now has an $80 minimum charge. We did not have, a problem with that as in the past it would be well worth it.However, it seems that now they have the minimum charge the standards have slipped.Food....... Very nice but nothing special. No 'Wow factor' as it had previously. Just good standard food and presentation that you can get in many restaurants in Singapore.Service..... Quite non existent at our table, yet we were there before they got busy. Not once did we get service without having to summons staff to the table.Food service....... Two meals came at same time, other meal at least 10 minutes later. Not good enough for this standard of restaurant.After asking staff 3 times where is the pak choy we ordered, and being told they would check, we were almost finished our meal when I told them to just cancel it. No apology forthcoming they just accepted we didn't want it now.Staff cleared the table after our meal but no offer of dessert or coffee was forthcoming.Our table had a candle just as all the other tables did..... But somehow they lit the ones on the other tables but took our one away.Overall...... A very disappointing experience in what should be one of the finest restaurants in Singapore. We won't be returning in a hurry.Tip for owners....... Putting an $80 minimum charge is fine but it lifts people's expectations. Get the standard back to what it was a few months ago and you will meet those expectations. At present they are a long way short
4
Stunning views over the city, especially from the viewing deck above the restaurant. Food was excellent although one of our orders got cancelled by mistake and I didn't receive mine until after everyone else had finished. Sing$ 600 for 6 people was pretty reasonable. Staff were attentive although restaurant was not full by any means. Definitely worth going there or have a drink in the bar at the viewing deck
1
Extremely bad attitude of manager and poor service level - I will never visit this place again. My boyfriend and I were there on 15 August 2015. When we arrived, there was no service staff to seat us. We saw an unoccupied table with used plates and glasses and decided to take that table. The service staff came and cleared the table then took our orders. We ordered a glass of beer and a glass of wine, which was part of deal for the entry fee we had paid.About 30 minutes later, one of the managers (he was wearing white shirt and grey pants while the rest of the service staff were wearing a black polo tee) came with a bill and wanted us to settle the bill. We did not order any food and the drinks we had ordered should be complimentary so we told him that there should nothing on the bill, it was clearly a mistake. The manager looked annoyed as if we refused to pay for something that we had ordered. He turned around and left, scolding us something in a language we didn't understand. I thought he must have made a mistake and probably was mad that perhaps, the previous customer left without settling the bill. 15 minutes later, he came around again, instead of apologising for his mistake, he said, "Would you like to order more drinks? or do you still want your free drinks?" Right after he said that, he smirked, turned around and walked down the stairs. What kind of attitude was that? I was shocked. He made a mistake, did not apologise, and showed us his terrible attitude. I am utterly disappointed with the restaurant management and the poor service level
5
Can not praise this restaurant enough. We were a party of 8 and all of us found the food to be amazing. The venue itself is unique. Situated at the top of the highest super tree the views are spectacular.Would recommend getting there early to enjoy a few cocktails before dinner
4
This was my third or fourth visit. The food is good though there are few vegetarian options. Friendly staff. There is a $80 minimum order statement on the menu. I don't know if they are serious about it. Too me, this seems a thoroughly bad idea. Very difficult to spend $80 per person if you are vegetarian and not drinking alcohol. Nevertheless, superb setting, good food, together with a visit to the Gardens by the Bay it makes a very nicely spent lunch and afternoon. The manager was very attentive to our vegetarian concerns
4
We visited here twice during our time in Singapore both times for some coffee and soft drinks. You can buy a $10 voucher/wristband which gives you access to the top of this 'tree' and a drink. Well worth doing. You can upgrade to $18 for a beer.We looked at the menu for the evening but had some difficulty getting booked in which suggests that it is a popular evening experience. The staff were really friendly and keen to offer service even though we were only there for a drink. There is both indoor and outdoor seating.The views are fantastic across the Gardens and the other sights - Marina Bay Sands, the Flyer, etc
4
...very unusual structures..lots of plants..and flowers...lots of people..be prepared to wait for your turn...in queues..or taxi ranks...
5
The food was beautiful, no complaints the staff were great and the views made the whole thing extra special.
4
Amazing views. Great location. You can enjoy viewing almost all attraction by the bay sitting in this restaurant. Must try this on a day without rain. Good food and great drinks
5
This trees have a very particular way to help the infrastructure of the park listen the explanation when you arrive to the park take the little ride .. You will get information about this fabulous constructions .. We need more of this Around the world
4
Had to pay to go up, but it includes a drink. The food was excellent and great view. Service was ok, I had to ask for my salad as my son was almost with his meal before mine came.
4
If you want a special dining experience that will stay in your memory then this restaurant is well worth a visit.The staff do make you feel special, which they should but is often not part of the package these days. Food was good, we all opted for finely sliced seared beef and pork dishes, with rice. Interestingly there was not much emphasis on vegetables either as accompaniments or actually intrinsic to the dish.The couple next to us shared an interesting looking fish soup, which was served from a tureen left on the table, (shades of RicknStein) and did look really good. They also shared a chocolate dessert which appeared disappointingly minuscule.We all commented on the fact that the multi coloured led lights around the central servery unfortunately reflected upwards and their reflection then blocked what would otherwise have been an amazing view. Luckily diners could migrate skywards to the roof bar above and enjoy al fresco drinks while also being able to enjoy the incredible panoramic view of Singapore's spectacular Marina Bay Area
4
Quality of the food and service are good. Just that the food is a little more expensive than outside.We had our dinner at the Restaurant and went up to the roof top bar to chill till late night.You can pay for an entrance fee (inclusive of a drink) 18$ I think to go up to the Rooftop bar. But if you have made reservation to dine at the restaurant, there is no entrance fee.There is a stunning view of MBS from the Rooftop bar and very breezy
2
We have visited this restaurant many times over the past few years and found that it has deteriorated over this period. Generally many of the dishes (waghu beef, fish, some salads and vegetables) seem to have been thrown onto a plate with little thinking on how they have been prepared, how they look and how they taste. The exception was the entree which samples all the favourites. This was ok but expensive which is a comment I would make generally about the menu...expensive and not good value for money. The interior and decor is also looking tired and needs an overhaul, especially at the prices charged. It's time this restaurant improves its food and value for money rather than just trying to trade on its views from the open-air bar which is the best part of the restaurant. Overall very disappointing...I won't go back and I don't recommend it!which is the best part of itbar on top of the tree
3
It was my third time at Supertree over the past two years and the overall conclusion is about the same.The food is excellent. There are quite negative reviews on the food but I have actually never been disappointed so far. The service is mediocre. It was bad at the start and they improved over the months, but it does not meet the expectation I have for such a place. To serve a starter together with the main-courses and the discussion thereafter why we want to have them first is embarrassingWhat I have been criticizing all along and what has not changed ever since is the fact that white wine is served luke-warm. By the time the wine is chilled, 3/4 of it is gone. Since prices are not the lowest, this is not acceptable.Indochine has a prime spot in Gardens by the Bay, they really could make more out of it
1
I've eaten at the Indochina that used to be at the Asian Civilisation museum as well as other ones around S E Asia. The SuperTree one is the worst. Slow and poor service. Questionable cleanliness of tables and silverware. Not especially clean and tidy toilets. Limited menu. Tourist trap. Strongly recommend skipping it and trying one of the many great restaurants Singapore offers
5
Expensive, but everything in Singapore is expensive! Cool experience, unique, great views. It would be a splurge if you have some extra cash in your pocket.
5
We enjoyed a drink here on our last evening in Singapore and it was a lovely place to sit, relax and take in the skyline.
4
Spectacular ambiance. Food is pricey but to experience it then I wouldn't mind. Attentive staffs I must say. My partner and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary there and it was amazing!
4
Before entering the restaurant go to the top bar and enjoy the view. In the restaurant you are sited around the outside tree structure and you will have some view. Starters was a lovely spicy Thai soup with lobster sorry but forgot the name it was really tasty and we also had salmon King tartar with herbs and spices just loved it. Main courses was lamb rack perfectly medium prepared and Wagyu beef chunks with garlic, again super delicious. All in all a good experience where food are chosen according to description with nice pictures on an iPad and when ready you are contacted by the waiter. Try it out it is a nice place with good service and good food and on top a different experience
3
Although we went during the day, evenings would be amazing with the light show.You are at height but it doesn't have the feeling of height. Well for us anyway and we are fine with height.In true Signapre style there is a premium to pay for beverages.Food great, service great
2
The location would deserve a 2 star michelin... But it's only an overpriced kitsch restaurant. U order by yourself by an iPad, good idea but only One each table so i have to wait till your partner finished. Great view from outside. Better if they change it in a cocktail bar
5
OK lets face it, it is not cheap, but,oh, the food, the ambiance and the view -- all amazing!The taste of the food was somehow really special, very tasty -- like a flavour explosion in the mouth. The scallops and prawns were very tender and just melted in the mouth. We will never eat another scallop again, they were just too good at this restaurant and they just can not be beaten.The ambiance is very romantic with wonderful views.To top it all off you will have access to the rooftop bar where you can also sit and have a cocktail and/or tapas. The rooftop bar is just amazing. Stunning outdoor 360 degree views over Singapore. Awesome. The views are jaw dropping and there is an amazing atmosphere.If you can't do the restaurant, the rooftop bar is a cheaper option and if I could only do one thing in Singapore - it would be this
5
We had drinks in the bar right on the top and food as well, though more of a platter of snacky bits than a full dinner, but other options were available. There is a cover charge which gets you your first drink (think it was about £10 equivalent) but it's so worth it. If you stay for longer drinks are not cheap - £10 for a pint of lager and about the same for a glass of wine, but you're playing for the view and the experience - worth every penny in my opinion
2
Unlike the majority of visitors to this restaurant and bar, I suspect, we visited in the afternoon. Having paid an outrageous $18 for the supposed privilege of visiting the rooftop bar, I was appalled. The rooftop bar itself was out of service – bars covered, no staff, no people. We therefore descended to the circular bar and restaurant below. We were directed to bar stools (fine) not in my position of choice and waited for our one "free" ($18) glass of wine. Apart from the fact that the view is almost completely obstructed by steel structures, wires and the like, the whole place was very shabby and gave the impression of being very poorly managed. Walking onto the platform outside, there was a barbecue covered in plastic, wilting plants, plastic chairs, broken matting etc. Inside, I observed that the glass bar was stuck together with tape. There were odd plants here and there. Not what you would expect from a bar and restaurant which should be a tourist attraction and certainly not what I would expect of Singapore.I started off this review by saying that we visited in the afternoon. Don't. Perhaps in the evening, the views – and even the food, but I doubt it – could make up for the shabbiness of the whole place. I have no idea about the food and service but, having seen this establishment in daylight, I would not recommend a visit at night. I would guess there are plenty of insects lurking.To be avoided
4
Dinner reservations at 8:30pm, and in Singapore, the trade winds were blowing pleasantly enough to cool any night. The walk from the taxi stand to the SuperTree was magical, with the most amazing use of common space I've ever seen. Approaching SuperTree, an elevator dropped me off and so began the dining experience. Given that Singapore is generally overpriced for food, SuperTree was probably around 20% more than the comparable food anywhere else in Singapore. I had a one drink, a fruit salad, a side, a main, a red wine and two desserts, and got out for S$187.00. A bit crazy, but hey, checked the box. So if you are a budget, skip dinner and go to straight to the rooftop bar. The view is spectacular, as you are the highest point in the Gardens by the Bay until you run into the Marina Sands Hotel. Drinks are still over priced, but you get an amazing experience
4
The view of Singapore and of Marina Bay is beautiful. The rest of the experience is not very good. Nevermind, it was fun to go there once.
4
You will never find a better location or view. Go after dark! Eating, drinking and panoramic view of the Singapore cityscape and the gardens by the bay. Brilliant.
2
I don't understand why this place is known, and why I was advised to go there.
Compared to location, atmosphere, set up... prices are horrendously high. I'm ready to pay, but when everything is top class.
Drinks upstairs are even worse.
1
Food quality paled in comparison to the spectacular view and light show. Really, keep your cash. Cocktails however were great and I don't even mind premium with that view.
4
The SuperTrees are very cool. And after the evening light show, it is really nice to disappear up one for dinner. Even better just to limit yourself to a drink on the rooftop terrace of IndoChine. One of the best views in the city...
4
I love Singapore and last time I was there they were developing these gardens and these trees were just starting to be built. There is a walkway between three of the trees which is great to walk across. Worth visiting and especially at night when the light show is on.
3
We arrived as the sun was setting, and the view over the Singapore skyline was superb. The 'trees' are very futuristic and Avatar-like, but when lit up they are quite beautiful. The service was average, but friendly; the drinks were nice and not too overpriced; skip the food-the platter was apparently "good for 4 people", but only if they had had a gastric band fitted. We were still hungry afterwards and there were two of us! Food quality was not good for the price, but we were there for the atmosphere and the views from the rooftop bar, and for this it is well worth it
2
The view from the top is quite nice. It is understandable that the owners would want to impose a cover charge of 18$ for an entry. However, what is not reasonable is the shockingly poor quality drink that they served. A group of 10 of us visited on a week day evening and paid the 18$ cover charge and we were all entitled to one house pour or spirit. We had a variety of drinks including Gin and tonic, vodka and soda and whisky. All tasted like gasoline *sic*. You couldn't find worse quality alcohol. This is a shame as I would rather that they charge a bit more and serve better drinks. I suggested this to the manager on duty who seemed totally unconcerned. so, I wouldn't recommend this place thought the view is not bad. Elsewhere (see my other reviews) on the roof top of the Esplanade serve top quality drinks for a much better view
3
This is our first time at this location although we are familiar with their other branches.Their food is always interestingly presented and quality usually quite acceptable; however it is consistently pricey.There were three of us and we wanted just a light lunch.We ordered the starter platter for 3-4 persons (SGD $85). It came with 4 crispy rice rolls, 4 poached prawn rolls, 6 kurobuta lycee beignets (served in porcelain spoons), 1 silver threadskin scallop roll cut into 4 portions, and 1 grilled squid cut into several rings. Portions were adequate and we had room for dessert.We ordered 1 Tiramisu (SGD $18), 1 Japanese matcha cheesecake (SGD $16), 1 Mango sticky rice (SGD $16).If you add drinks, service charge + GST, the total bill can be quite unfriendly..... for a light lunch. For dinner, the minimum spend is SGD 80 pp. inclusive of drinks
3
I don't think this is a restaurant that I would visit very often. I've eaten in a couple of the IndoChine restaurants in Singapore and though this one had far and away the best location the food was average considering the cost. Service was a little slow and by the end of the night I was definitely ready to go! You will get some great photographs from the rooftop bar. Bottom line is the location is superb but better options, even within their own restaurants, as regards the food
4
The food was good but service was a little slow as we pre-booked a party of over 30 people. I assume with a smaller group service would be quicker. The atmosphere is well worth the visit.
3
Great place to bring visitors too. The view and the ambiance is fantastic but unfortunately pretty much everything else is average.
3
Nice view of the CBD and marina area. For $18 cover, you get a drink and entry to the rooftop. Pretty decent for that price. However, subsequent food/drinks order can be quite pricey.
4
Highly recommend the rooftop terrace at supertree by Indochine as a great venue, took some friends visiting us from Australia for a great evening sipping cocktails and watching the sun disappear and the city light up. Food was also really good - share platters and tapas style finger food
1
Came with my girlfriend after being recommended by the hotel for an excellent view. The view was ok, as it was dinner and the restaurants inside was so illuminated that the view of outside was not really great. The service was ok, food was horrible. We had the lobster, which was terrible. Starters very bad as well... I guess they aim for one time visitors and dont really care about repeat clients
3
Had drinks and bar snacks of Truffle Fries, Crispy Prawns (egg yolk style) & Nem Re So (Scallop). The food was terrible. I could not taste the freshness and the quality was bad. Draft beer wasn't fantastic and the lime margarita was just alright. It was more disappointing as i was there to spend my birthday evening. Thankfully the only thing i can still credit a high rating to was customer service. The manager on duty Benjamin was patient to our feedback and staff were great！ Really hope there will be great improvements
2
I went as a social outing to meet a friend's sister. We were fairly new to Singapore and thought it would be a cool experience to sit in the Super trees at night and eat a nice dinner (you'd assume the food is amazing since the rest of Singapore has such yummy food!) But it's expensive, the choices are lame, and the food quality was atrocious for the price. We sent food back! The rooftop patio/bar for tapas and drinks isn't a bad idea though. MUCH better view and you likely won't spend as much ... also drinks are harder to mess up
4
Heard about the Super Tree and decided to visit the place. Intent was not really for the food but for the view given the restaurant is sited at the highest point in Garden by Bay. I made a call booking and was welcome by a guest relation officer who lead me to a lift. A nice touch. I always have a soft spot for personalisation. Out of the lift, I made my way to the sitting. Narrow. I snuggled into my seat. The menu is Vietnam fusion. I called for spring roll, noodles and meat on a stick. Food is nice, not top of places but good enough for the price. After meal, I embarked on the reason I came to the place. Yes, the covered walkway around the tree. I made my way and absorbed the views. In a way, this sighting offset meal cost. Just before leaving the place, I noticed a small stairways by the lift, I asked and was told it leads to a pub. I walk up and wow.. an open roof top with the marina sands hotel and Garden by Bay as backdrop. Sitting on the sofa and immersing in the open air and views with a drink in hand, I submerged into a persona of James Bond. .cool and Yes, The Room With a View is worth the visit !
1
The location is good, but the restaurant is shabby. The food is served cold, and is tasteless. The service is incredibly slow and the staff are terrible. We are just amazed at how bad this place was. Especially if you realise we paid 600 SGD for 3 people. DO NOT GO HERE
1
Ok, the location is good, but that's where it all ends.. The food is served cold, and tasteless. Felt like they took things out of the freezer and microwaved them to serve. The service is incredibly slow and after a while, they even put very loud music (hiphop, techno, what have you) and disco lights. We were still eating our dinner and felt like we just landed in a nightclub or something. We are just amazed by how bad this place was. Especially if you realise we paid 600 SGD for 5 persons. Really, save your money and time and go somewhere else
4
We had drinks and tapas at this lovely venue and could enjoy the views of Marina Sands and surrounding areas, well worth a visit!
4
Food its Ok nothing specracular but ok . Incredible sight view! From the very top of the big tree! Service is very good. A little beat expensive but it worth it.
5
Wonderful place for a drink and/or a meal with views of Singapore that will take your breath away. Don't miss it!
2
Me and my partner arrived for dinner after a fantastic few days in Singapore. Unfortunately this wasn't the cherry on the cake that we had hoped for.The food was cold and as a result, tasteless. Whilst eating (literally fork in hand) we were asked to move table because the table beside us needed extra seats. Completely unacceptable.There was a large corporate scheduled for later in the evening upstairs so they decided to sound test at full volume there and then whilst people were dining?! This should have been done during a quieter part of the day. Decoration was tacky, toilets were not clean and the outside decking area was cluttered.After complaining to the waitress a 10% discount was offered but the manager himself never came over to apologise, despite him being barely 10 yards away. Funnily enough, he was counting money

We were visiting our friends who live in Singapore and they said the highlight of our visit would be for them to take us to see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay and to afterwards dine in the Indochine Supertree restaurant.The first part of our experience was fantastic with a brilliant 15 minute light show, but the second part of the evening proved to be frustrating and disappointing.We were shown to our table and having settled down to look at the menus, we noticed that we had been seated directly opposite the dumb waiter, where all the staff gathered for service. We asked for a table change and after a while we were shown to another table.After selecting our meals we placed our order directly with the waiter, as we chose not to use the table ipad menu, because we had some questions to ask regarding our selection.The starters arrived in stages but suited our pace of eating, however one main meal arrived before we had finished our starters.We then waited another 30 minutes before the next main meal arrived, despite repeatedly asking the Assistant Restaurant Manager on several occasions to find out when the remaining meals would arrive.The third meal arrived 5 minutes later, but the final meal took another 10 minutes.Of course by this time half our table had finished their meals, which was not in keeping by any means with a place that boasted excellent service and fine dining.The one saving grace was that the food was good quality and tasty.On a final note the toilets were a disgrace, filthy, smelly and not fit for use

My company had the roof terrace for private hire during our event, and it was wonderful. The food was superb, the view amazing and the breeze was just wonderful up there, a nice warm breeze to blow away the humidity.The light and sound show each night is also pretty impressive, it's worth a visit

I live in Singapore and I must say, if I have guests coming over and I need to take them to only 1 place in Singapore, the rooftop bar would be that place. Just look at the pictures posted here. You get an outstanding view of the city in all directions.The best thing about the place is that because it's not as popular as Level 33 or 1 Altitude Bar, it is never crowded. There is always a breeze blowing through which is great in the hot weather of Singapore. Come at around 6 to 7 pm and watch the sun set over the city and you will not be disappointed.2 things you may not like though. One is the food and drinks which is good, but not excellent. And secondly, when the Rhapsody show is on, you will not get to see any of it from the tower. For that, you should go to the observation deck across the Gardens by the Bay

The place is at Marina Bay.There are few tree lookalike structures in that area and one of them is Supertree restaurant.Prior booking is strongly advised.The spread of the menu is very good and so the taste .The items are reasonably priced in comparison to Singapore standards.The restaurant has good ambience and it gives a great view of sorrounding areas

While visiting Gardens by the Bay, we wanted to have a drink and snack in one of the Supertrees. Indochine was our choice. The top patio wasn't open for service, but we went up anyway to take some beautiful pictures of Marina Bay and the surrounding area. We went to the restaurant and though they weren't busy, they didn't want to seat us at a table just for drinks. After we insisted and said we would order food, were were given a table. Overall it was a nice experience. The food was good, but fairly expensive, as you would expect from a "destination" restaurant

A unique experience, two type of different experience in one venue. Dinner at the restaurant and after dinner drink at the rooftop. Fusion decor along the restaurant goes well with the fusion selection of food served, ordered a bottle of wine meant to be continue at the rooftop proven to be a good decision by my wife. View at the roof top overlooking from Garden by the bay, singapore flyer, Marina Bay Sand and MBFC was simply breath taking! And I believer anyone at Roof top feel the same as the first thing when they reach the roof top they reach out for their camera or phone.. Overall it a good experience other then the very soft background music during dinner.. food can be better if slightly less oily, oil makes it very chinese.

This review is quite a bit late - my wife and I visited last June 2014. We were in Singapore for 2 nights and the first night ate at Chinatown. The variety and quality of food down there was quite good and the prices quite low - something of a rarity for Singapore these days. We went out looking around the beautiful city of Singapore and wound up at the gardens and were truly amazed at the wonder of this place. We had been out all day that day and it was getting close to dinner time. We looked at the cafe's at the other end of the park and it had quite a variety of food but nothing really appealed to either of us. Then we saw this restaurant and it looked amazing. My wife was really keen to go up and try it. I wasn't really fazed either way to be honest. The prices were not terribly expensive but it wasn't cheap either so for that reason you could expect high quality food.The dÃ©cor is something to be proud of and the staff were really nice and professional. We went up the lift and were shown to our table. We ordered our meals and a couple of drinks and soaked up the atmosphere - it was getting darker outside now and the lights around the restaurant were being turned on. Almost immediately our meals came out with the drinks. I ordered a selection of seafood and my wife ordered fish and vegetables. My wife was really impressed with the fish and passed me some on her fork. It really was very nice, then I tried my seafood. That's odd!!! It was room temperature, I really didn't give it a second thought and just ate my meal. That was a mistake - seafood and room temperature do not mix!! About an hour later we were almost back at our hotel and I was starting to feel the effects of what that meal had done to me. Perhaps it was just bad luck? Perhaps the staff thought it was normal to eat seafood that way. But any chef should surely know that isn't the case. It's a pity as the restaurant is in a fantastic location and the surroundings were superb. This experience didn't ruin our holiday luckily my wife had something in our medical kit which got me back on track within hours, however if I went back - I might just take a sandwich and sit down and watch the light show next time. I wouldn't chance eating there again

Incredibly disappointing, view and location couldn't make up for the HORRID service. If there was a -ve rating, I would give it. Decided to bring my group of overseas guests to what I thought was the best place for dinner - Indochine has pretty good food and the SuperTree is known for its view. I thought wrong. 1. Some food never arrived despite ordering it on the iPad with a 'Order Submitted' confirmation given.2. Upon checking with the wait staff the status of the food orders, the waitress said:"Yea you put the order in the iPad but you didn't tell me."The food NEVER arrived and just a word of advice Indochine, don't give people the iPad if it's not going to submit any orders. That way your guests would most probably get food on their table. UTTERLY EMBARASSING

We went with some friends. The friends live in Singapore and are used to dining out at some extremely good restaurants. They have taken us to some unforgettable places. We were all excited because the location is stunning. We arrived and had drinks at the top outside which was amazing, but they charge a lot for their drinks, be warned. There were very few people there, maybe we should have realised then something was not quite right.The food was poor. It was barely warm and massively overpriced, none of the meals were in any way worth the high prices they charge. I couldn't eat my main course, it had a very strange smell which completely put me off. all our meals were served at completely different times. The wine is hugely expensive, the toilets are awful, in fact dirty. There was a function going on at the time which was so noisy we couldn't really have a conversation.If you are thinking of going don't. I have never written a review on here before, I felt I had to to stop anyone else wasting their money and being disappointed. The friends who took us were upset, that was a real shame as they had been so caring about where they took us and had given us a wonderful time in Singapore
1
Beyond disappointing! We had high expectations as the location is stunning. However, the food was way below average - barely luke warm on a cold plate. Meals came at different times, so two of us had finished our main meal before the other two meals arrived. Fish dish with cashew nuts had a strange smell - waitress took it to the chef who said it was fine. Waitress wanted to clear the empty plates before we had all finished. Wine terribly over priced as was the food. Don't bother to go for dinner here

OK here's the real deal on Indochine. This restaurant situated in the Supertree at Gardens by the Bay has a restaurant and roof top bar. Don't bother dining at the restaurant unless someone else is paying. To eat in the restaurant there is a minimum spend of SG$80+++ pp. I actually rang to book a table before leaving hm to be told it was booked out so my hubby and I thought we would come to the rooftop bar instead ( you can get food up there as well). It costs SG$18 to get up there but you do get a complimentary drink or SG $10 & a soft drink. We arrived at 5.30 and as the bar wasn't yet open were told we could sit on the bar stools in the restaurant. We did order a cheese platter for 2 which was very nice. It is a little sad and tired looking. We then headed up to the rooftop a little later.The view is great and it's very pleasant sitting up there. I would recommend you arrive around 6.30-45 mid wk (sunset is at 7), have your complimentary drink and order some tapas dishes off the menu. Once all the lights come on its gorgeous but just remember your there for the view not the food
3
Food: food is good with a huge choice. One of thing is that if you order rice they bring out a huge bowl and scoop it out on your plate. Not very graceful. Staff: they are trying but so many mistakes for one night. Initially when I called to book by phone they said that we would have to wait 45' before getting a table around our desired time but they would offer us free drinks for the inconvenience. I asked twice to confirm. As we got there, the bar manager practically called me a liar and didn't even bother checking with the person who took my booking. Then, dishes were coming in random orders and half our food was cold when we started eating. They forgot to bring our wines and we had to wait for ages to get a waiter's attention. Atmosphere: music is a bit too clubby for a restaurant and it's freezing cold. The views are really nice though. Beware animal lovers; you'll be most likely sitting on cow skin if you get a couch. Prices: too expensive for the service you get but the food is good

Visited at 3pm hoping for an oasis after a hot but exhilarating skywalk. Paid $18 each to enter Indochine, but found only rude staff, empty (uninhabitable) rooftop, obstructed views and a sad looking fish in a very small tank. The included drink turned out to be half size only.Disappointing.
2
I was expecting a great lunch with a great view. When I got up, I was offered a limited choice of tables on the opposite side of Marina Bay Sands, i.e. the view was only towards the sea with the ships (obstructed by the Supertree structures), not towards the city. The other side was closed. Moreover, it was not possible to see the view they announce because the rooftop bar was closed at lunchtime. They charge $10 for entrance. That buys you a drink. The food was not outstanding, but the prices were. Afterwards we went to the Supertree dining food court, which had a broad variety, better food, and lower prices

This unique restaurant forma part of the Marina Gardens, Gardens by the Bay complex in central Singapore. You ascend via a fast lift and once at the top of the tree you have the most amazing views across Singapore. It is possible to walk round the perimeter at the top so ensuring you can see all of Singapore. The staff were very efficient and the food - a fusion style - was quite delicious.At the end of the meal you can stay on the the Gardens to watch the spectacular light show. A fantastic experience and very well worth a visit
5
Had visited Gardens by the Bay the day before and didn't know this place existed until we went back with a local friend. $18 entry fee also gives one drink of either soft drink, wine or spirits. The manager was very accommodating with taking everyone's photos. Great views of Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands hotel at night. If you time the visit for 1945 or 2045 hours, then you will also enjoy the music light show at the super tree grove. Enjoyed our visit

The setting of the restaurent in the largest of 'trees' near the botanical garden is magical. Be sure to walk the skybridge as well.

Indochine restaurants have a good reputation in Singapore and Supertree doesn't disappoint. Affording spectacular views of the Marina Bay Sands it isnt cheap, but the food is very good and the service friendly. Certainly worth a visit.

Went to Indochine for my mums birthday and it was spectacular! Sitting up the top in the bar before dinner watching the sun set over Singapore, was one of the best things you can see! There were families there with children too so it is children friendly! The food was lovely, yet definitely overpriced and the service was wonderful! The view when eating and seeing the supertrees light up was amazing! All the food is tasty and there is a good choice of wine! Definitely go if you are after the experience of a life time! I can't wait to go back =
1
For what it could be, I was very disappointed. Nestled amongst the Gardens By The Bay, with a specular view, the decor seemed unfinished and thrown together with a mix-match of items. For what I paid for, the food lack flavor, in particularly for Asian food, the flavor should explode in your mouth. We then went to the roof top for a drink, and that was disappointing as well. Poor music quality, sleepy songs. This place could be so much more. For what I paid for there are so many better restaurants to choose from like Catalunya or even a food court.

IndoChine's location in one of the largest of the SuperTrees in the Gardens by the Bay has got to be one of the great wonders of the world. It offers a spectacular view of Singapore, the gardens, the Sands hotel, and the harbor beyond.It's easy to get caught up in the location, but I must say that IndoChine offered one of the best meals I've had in Singapore at a price comparable to other restaurants along the river that offer a lot less and aren't nearly as tasty. Also, luncheon prices make eating in an upscale restaurant such as this much more affordable. I had a combo of King Salmon sashimi and tempura vegetables. The sashimi literally melted in my mouth. The tempura was light, crispy, and included an interesting array of vegetables. Even the house wine was delicious.I would absolutely recommend spending time in this incomparable location and also indulging in the cuisine

Let's start with the one good thing about this place; the view is amazing from the rooftop bar. But that is also the only thing ... When we got our table, it seemed like a table put ready quickly to accommodate as much people as possible. Not the usual face to face seating but at a side - and almost in the way for people going outside. When asked a different table, we were lucky that couple next to us finished so they quickly set that up but forgot glasses and napkins. Our starters came rather on time and were ok but not worth the heavy price tag at all. Surprisingly for a restaurant with this expensive menu, our cutlery wasn't taken away after the starters but had to be used again. The plates were covered in finger prints - again not something you'd like to see in this kind of restaurant. As a main course we had the lamb which was good but the fish dish was just a joke. Supposed to be with a poached pear but the pear was stone hard and also supposedly with cashew nuts but they were just put at the side - straight out of a package you can get in any supermarket. When we complained - it was clear that this happens often. No comment or apology. The took the plate away and removed the item of our bill. After this disaster we decided to pay quickly and leave .. And never come here again.

Went with parents for a nice evening meal whilst staying in Singapore.We'd previously been to the marina one, but was told has since moved.The setting was fantastic, would definitely recommend eating out on the balcony part as the views of the city all lit up were exceptional. Also felt very private as we were sat in sort of booths with cushions.WARNING the balcony part is just grates so be care with high heels getting stuck! both my mother and I ruined our heels!The food was good, but probably slightly over priced.All in all a lovely evening, with cocktails on the rooftop. Would recommend for the experience (just watch out for the grates
3
Went to drinks at 7.15pm - $18 cover charge gets you one free housepour, beer or wine - and entry to the top floor open air bar at the top of the highest Supertree Note - we called ahead of time to check the dress code and were told no shorts/no slippers (flip flops?) but when we got there most people were casually dressed so not sure of the rules - imagine most visitors there after day at the Gardens?The main view of is the city and bay - you won't see the 745pm light show from here - so quick drinks and down to the ground floor so $18 for 30 minutes or so is quite expensive + truffle fries for $17!But am always quick to criticize poor customer service so wanted to write a review especially forLennie who got us in the best positions for photos and took them for us and was welcoming and professional.My only real bug bear - no iced water! They only "sell" bottled - hate this practice, especially when we had all paid $18 and two of us only had fruit juices.So good stuff and bad points - worth a visit but go earlier to get your times worth..but be at the Supertree light up at 745pm - it's really beautifu

i visited Supertree with my family...its basically a bar with an amazing view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel ,the Flyer and the Anchored Ships..besides that a total dissappointment...one of the staff member kept eating standing inside the bar which was very unusual..they seriously need to work on their menu and staff...a good place for drinks and view.
1
My window at the Marina Bay Sands looked over the Supertree Grove and the Indochine bar was recommended by a friend. We went there - it was $18 to get in with a complimentary drink - and were offered the choice of Tiger or Heineken. We chose Tiger. We had been drinking Tiger all week and what we were given (in a glass) was totally NOT Tiger. More like a home brew. Stay away and save your money. Just enjoy walking around the beautiful gardens
1
Asked for a beer and they served a fake tiger. One sip and left this was so dodgy we discussed it and agreed a full beer and a quick exit was required
4
The rooftop bar was fabulous. Definitely would bring my friends in there. The restaurant is another story. The place is too small. Surely, family gatherings should not be held in there. But the food gave a good impression.
2
We only went to the rooftop bar for a drink. It was SNG$18 each for entry and 1 drink. Very average drink and as it was dark the view was very disappointing perhaps its better in the light. There are so many other places to go for a better drink and a better view. Just walk around the gardens for free, that was fabulou

While we rely heavily on Trip Adviser we were recommended to this establishment by two ex patriots who live in Singapore, we decided to try it on that basis even after we looked at Trip Adviser, I have to admit our experience is far different than those of an adverse nature in the reviews of the restaurant. The location and lighting at Christmas season is exceptional, the venue is round in shape and a little cramped but still comfortable. The food, well I decided on a mild curry and my wife on the tempura. The curry was not mild although i did ask for it to be very mild, without hesitation it was removed and another beef dish was ordered and brought to me very quickly, it was just as I liked it cooked. The service was very good and friendly, the test is the question "Would I go back?" the answer is simply, yes I most certainly would so give it a try please. It was also good value for money
1
We have during the years enjoyed the IndoChine food at Empress Place.This time the food ordered was tasteless.The Pomelo Salad the worst I have ever eaten in Asia during the last 40 years.We asked for some chili flakes to spice it up and they came with pepper!!This place is a totally overpriced tourist trap.The gents toilet was also rather filthy.A good view from the bar but the food in the restaurant not worth to order,Are tall he chefs new?We will not come bac

Having dined at the restaurant three times, I'd rate the restaurant as mediocre and poor value. I find the decor garish and overwhelming and strangely blocked by the struts of the Supertree structure.Walking around with visiting guests however, we chose to have a drink at the rooftop bar. It's like chalk and cheese! Ok, I admit $18 entry per adult or $10 per child sounds like a lot, but given that a G & T/glass of wine costs S$17-19 per glass and a soft drink $8 (THIS IS SINGAPORE!!!) it's worth it.Come on, just do it! The view is totally unblocked and super stunning, better than from Marina Bay Sands, where you might have to pay an entry fee too if not a guest. Loved the fact that the waiters up here automatically switch on their mobile phone lights to give you the best photos at night! Sweet gesture when not too busy.Great place to chill for a drink and soak in the night skyline in a surprisingly quiet spot. Guess the entry fee keeps up the hoards the tourists
1
Save your money and go to get a drink at the bar above the restaurant instead. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the views are amazing. The food on the other hand was absolutely horrible and hugely overpriced. Additionally, the service was horrendous. Asked specific questions about a few of the dishes and the waitress was less than helpful. Asked how spicy one of the salads was and she told us not at all, the salad was incredibly spicy. We ordered bottles of wine, one ended up being a twist off, the other traditional and the waitress had no idea how to open it. She didn't have an opener, and had to go find someone else to open the wine
4
Had a great evening at the 'Garden by the Bay' and when i reached the SuperTree, was impressed with the structures and the concept. Was curious about the view from the top and chose to pay the entry fee and get on top of these SuperTree's. Was a good experience with a value for money (includes a drink 18$). the view was simply breathtaking, perfect Skyline View of Marina Bay Sands Hotel & Singapore Flyer

My husband and I are in Singapore for a visit. Our local friend recommended that we should go to SuperTree to enjoy a romantic dinner. So we called to make a booking on Friday to dine on Sunday at 7.30. So as per usual, we arrived at the restaurant and told the receptionist that we have reserved a table for 2 under the name of xxx. Then she looked at the list and couldn't find our booking. So she called upstairs to the restaurant to ask if there's any table for us and while they were checking upstairs, the receptionist asked us to wait on one side whilst she served the rest of the people in the queue. 15 mins later.... still waiting.... she finally told us that they don't have our reservation and there's no free table until 9.30 (which was 1.5 hrs away). So I said, I called on Friday to reserve a table, it's not my fault that you don't send SMS or email confirmation for table reservations. So how was I supposed to make sure that I have a booking?! Then she called up again and this time magically there was a table available!! (I wasn't trying to make her live difficult to be honest, it's because it was our last night in Singapore and all the restaurant in that area is either completely full or it's at least 20 mins walk away)Anyway, so we have a free table so I thought we'll just head up to the restaurant and enjoy our dinner. As we got up to the top, the front of house lady was very welcoming and she showed us to our table and she gave us our menu. But I guess that's all the service we deserved... We were studying the menu for at least 10 mins with no one coming to take our drinks order. We had to track down one of the by passing waiter to get a drink. Then finally some grumpy old man came to our table to take our food order. Our food came relatively quickly but no one told us what food they were putting on our table and our appetizers/mains were all thrown on our table until there was not enough room to put everything... The grumpy old man actually removed my mobile phone from the table to put down one plate of food then walked behind me and put the phone back down on the other side of the table!! Really not sure what kind of service is that?! So after all the food was left on our table there were none of those 'enjoy your meal' or would you like any sauce or anything else, we were just left on our own. No one came to top up our water, no one came to check whether we are ok or not.After we've finished our meal, I had to ask twice for the bill coz they've forgotten about us. As we walked towards the door, the grumpy old man walked passed us without even saying thank you or hope you've enjoyed your meal etc. He just walked straight passed us!!It's a pitty service is so bad in Indochine. I mean, a meal up there is not one of your averagely priced meal. We had 2 glasses of Processo, after tax and service is over S$21 and that's already on offer! One bottle of wine starts from S$106 after tax. With these sort of price, I would expect a little bit better service. All in all, I can only see the front of house lady running around taking guests to tables, taking orders, serving food, topping up water and pretty much anything and everything that needs doing, she's there. But there's only one of her....The 2 points is only for the view from the restaurant and for the rooftop bar. Really very bad service

We have lived here in Singapore for the last 20 years and by now we are quite familiar with a long list of the best restaurants, places of interests and 5 star hotels. Our expectations are quite high when it comes to good food and we are willing to splurge. But, we were not lucky for this food adventure at the SuperTree Indochine. Location and ambience at the Rooftop Bar is superb. It has the perfect skyline view of both Marina bay sands hotel and Singaopre flyer. You will certainly have the best snapshots to share with family and friends. Great place to unwind and enjoy cocktails after a long hard day at the office. Ordered Mojito, but then again my mixture of Mojito at home is way better. Food at the restaurant is ordinary. Menu was limited and in my personal opinion there was no yummy factor. Nothing in the menu that can make me say, I can't wait to eat that again or I am looking forward to our next visit. Could be because we haven't tried the rest of their menu. I would probably skip eating at the restaurant next time. Staff were nice and so welcoming! Will visit the place again somehow for the ambience but not so soon
2
The experience was good, and quite unique. The food, however, was ordinary. We found the atmosphere excellent, but IndoChine fell short on the value proposition. Another Singapore experience of poor value for money - all too common in Singapore these days.
4
Worth the visit. Good mixture of seafood, continental and asiatic food but the view at night and the setting are spectacular.
3
I was in Singapore with a friend, and a business friend of mine offered to take us out for drinks and a tour on our first night. He chose the SuperTree, and we arrived only 40 minutes before the bar closed. Seeing as he paid the cover fee, we were very grateful for the experience and the chance to snap a few spectacular photos. We each got just the glass of wine that came complimentary with the cover charge and left, so I can't say anything for the food. The place was pretty empty at that point, with only one other group of people on the rooftop. The server was kind and took some photos for us. If you're going to bother with the cover charge, I recommend going at night and just enjoying the view with drinks
3
The rooftop experience deserves five stars...it was a private catered affair on a beautiful day-into-evening when it was not raining. All good. The views are stunning especially as Singapore's lights come up. The buffet dinner below was not extraordinary but it was a great time nonetheless
4
When in Singapore, there is no way of not visiting Gardens by the Bay. However, for those who have too little time to look at the botanical gardens or who would rather invest the admission money in a drink, the Super Trees will be the place to be, as they are the highlight of the gardens. The plants-covered steel frames are between 25 and 50 meters high. They are used for the breeding of rare plants and at night lit by solar power. Rain is collected in their funnels for the irrigation of the plants. Some of the trees serve as cooling towers for the cooling systems of the gardenâ€™s domes. Two of the towers are connected with a bridge at a staggering height.In one of the trees you will find the Indochine, a restaurant with a cocktail lounge on the roof terrace, from where you can enjoy a spectacular view onto the city

indifferent tourist clip joint poor food ran out of two wines on the, food was edible Chinese just , no one else there not at all surprised , even the views were like Disney Land gone wrong !STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO VISIT THIS RESTAURANT ! wish I had not had no choice taken by clients I paid just to get out ASAP !
4
After a wander around the gardens we decided to have lunch up in the trees. You pay $10 and includes a free drink and the lift up. When we arrived we were told lunch wouldn't be starting for 10 mins and that we could go up to the rooftop bar and have a look and then come back down. The views at the top were stunning and was lovely to sit so high up and see the gardens and other landmarks. We took a few pics before heading back down and lunch was now available.We had a lovely plush seats and a great view. There was plenty to choose from on the menu even for myself who is a vegetarian. We were given plenty time to make our decisions and take in the stunning views. The food was lovely and service was good.Defo worth a visit for the food and the views
1
Nice view, but appalling service and misleading prices. There was a card on the table stating clearly that the house wine was $18, but when we got the bill we were charged a different (higher) price. The staff refused to rectify the mistake. In addition, service was generally slow and inattentive despite not being too busy - we had to stand up several times to get any attention from the waiting staff.Overall - cannot recommend supporting a venue that treats customers in this way

I was there with my boyfriend for my birthday celebration.We were originally seated at a table with plastic chairs, looking out at the Gardens side of this Supertree. Not a fantastic view, so I asked for a change of seats to one of the tables facing the Marina Bay Sands side with plush chairs, and was promptly redirected to a table there.The waiter (I'm a little sorry I didn't ask for his name, but I think he's excellent at his job, and he made our evening very enjoyable. Thank you!) serving us for the night was wonderful. We were having some drinks (mine's a White Witch cocktail, and his was a Stella), when we looked out and saw a walkway. We asked our waiter if we could go out on the veranda, and he said, yes, and helped us to bring our drinks outside, and recommended a seat that had a fantastic view of the MBS. He also brought our appetizer (white bait with salted egg crumbs) out to us, and said that he would call us when our mains are ready. For our mains, he also recommended that we have rice with our mains (honey ribs and beef rump), as that would make the dishes more tasty. Throughout dinner, he was attentive without being intrusive, and we managed to have a lovely dinner. He also remembered my first drink was a White Witch, and asked if he could bring me another when he saw my glass was empty. Pro-tips:1. Ask for a seat inside rather than near the entrance, because the chairs are more comfortable2. The mains are quite large, so they're good for sharing (maybe 2 mains to 3 people).3. Do go up to the rooftop bar - this was quite possibly the best. We were trapped due to heavy rain, but I think you can also have dinner upstairs on the bar. The unobstructed view of MBS and the Flyer in the distance is quite breathtaking

entry is $10/18 includes a free drink (either basic or alcoholic)views are magnificent up in the treetop overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Hotel & the gardens. Food was not expensive given the location ($36 for 2 share plates & a drink)rooftop opens ater int he evening - but it can get very hot up there during the da
5
First of all, where else are you going to be able to find a rooftop bar in a treehouse? It's a welcome respite for Singapore. Go early in the day and great their beer.
4
After a visit of the Flower Dome, go have a drink up the SuperTree. The drink+elevator cost 18 SGD, but the view is worth it, and you can get some decent snacks up there. Do not expect great food, though, it's just tapas-like, but fresh and tasty.You sit on the 'tree rooftop', outside, there is lounge music, great view, mix of tourists and ... tourists, then you can watch the great light show in the trees, and later on walk across to the MBS and look at the laser show... it's a great stop especially around 6 to 8 pm

We visited Super Tree for dinner. The wait wasn't too long and the lounge is on the roof and has a great view of the surrounding area. We found the lounge area so nice that we went back after dinner to enjoy the evening. The food was decent and our service was very good. I would return again if we make it back to Singapore again

I have been here a couple of times now, both for lunch and dinner and I honestly believe that the reviews are a little harsh. Yes, it is expensive, but then it is a rather unique proposition and more impressive at night than in the daytime. Yes, the service is not intuitive or spontaneous, but it was not bad either. The menu is impressive and expansive and I couldn't fault the quality of the food. It has been excellent both times I've eaten there. The cost of the wine is ridiculously expensive, but apart from that, I have no complaints and would certainly return

I have several major issues with this restaurant .Firstly the cover charge ( $10-18) to actually get the lift to the restaurant .It is redeemable for a soft drink - expensive coke ! Once there the view is fantastic but the service was generally below poor . The young lady on duty ( it was early 12noon) was almost zombie like in her affect . Her responses were monosyllabic and very slow - we felt like unwelcome intruders . The young man who eventually appeared to take our orders was friendly and helpful .We had 2 of the mixed entre platters which were generally good except for some bullet like meat things . It was expensive .Walk the skyway to get the same view and eat somewhere where they are keen for your custom and it's half the price
4
we went to the rooftop bar, which is build on top of the supertree - after the laser show. This is a really great experience - sitting in a nice bar and have one of the best views of Singapore skyline by night and of course also of the Marina Bay Sands - it is really worth visiting. Also the food is good and tasty. I would really recommend visiting the rooftop bar!
4
We made a reservation, but had to wait half an hour for a table. But when we had a table we enjoyed this place very much. All food was great (especially the duck!) and of course the location is great. I'm really going to visit again
4
Over the years we have watched the development of Gardens by the Bay so as the SuperTree restaurant run by the IndoChine group was now opened it was a must-do for this trip to Singapore. The food was very nice and not over the top in price. The service could have been a little more attentive but the subsequent view from the Rooftop Bar after dinner made the experience well worth it. You felt as if you were on top of the world - unrestrained.(I did note a traveller's photo of the men's toilet. The women's toilet was almost as bad with the door opening outwards to be seen by diners in the restaurant bar area. Not a very good design or look at all but there would have been limited space. Still not easy for wheelchair access I would think.

Went for business dinner. The whole place looks very impressive when you approach it. We were sitting outdoor. The pluses were a fantastic view and a wonderful breeze. The big minus was some kind of show that was happening right below. The show lasts around 10 minutes and repeats at certain intervals. It took place twice while we were having dinner, the music from the show was super loud and disturbing.Apart from that the restaurant's sound system speaker was right above our table. Several requests were made to waiters to turn the volume down and several times it "magically" went back up several minutes later. Until I spoke to the manager. Even after that the volume went back up again, and then the manager came to our table if to convince himself that our complaints were justified. Only after that was it turned to an acceptable volume. Music selection was quite bad by the way. The food was just average and wine was overpriced. Conclusion: good for one-time business dinner but I wouldn't think of returning there

Photos and Review @ http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/09/eat-and-play-supertree-by-indochine-and.htmlGreat for special occassions! The view is great as you can see the garden, Spore Eye or MBS from the "tree", but if you want a specific view, do indicate when you make your reservation.Food is actually not too bad (unlike the many reviews on the poor food quality), i wouldnt say its fantastic but not as bad as it was reviewed. We had the crispy silver fish and my kids love munching them. Their salmon sashimi is also very thickly sliced, yum! Avocado in crab sauce is delightful and hubby love the crab sauce. I like the creamy and very coffee-y creme brulee...Overall, we had a great meal. After meal, we even walk around the "tree" to enjoy the scenery.However, the price is at the steep side, but i guess you are paying for the view. Great for special occassions, not so great for normal dining unless you really sit there very long to enjoy the view. Do opt to sit inside as outside can get pretty warm as there is no fan, only natural wind.

There is wonderful view at evening.
Just it.
I went there after dinner.
Just one glass of beer.
I really enjoy nice view and I was fine.

We stopped here for lunch while visiting the gardens. Service was fast and friendly. The menu selections were original and the dishes tasty. Good views all around. Pricey though!
2
The view from the outdoor bar was incredible but drinks were $20 for a glass of wine. Once in the restaurant the decor was average and the food even more. Reheated prawns on a bed of lemongrass stew was cold. No bottle of wine under $100 for not very good wine. Have a drink at the outdoor bar but give the rest a miss
5
Located at the heart of Garden By The Bay. On top of one of the artificial giant tree. Great place for hang out! You have the fine dining area and the bar on the roof top with the beautiful view of Singapore Marina Bay area. Great place 
4
Located in the Super Tree Grove in the tallest Super Tree ( about 30 metres above the ground) and therefore offers an excellent view of the Gardens day or night. Also a perfect place to escape the humidity and take a rest from the superb gardens. Thoroughly recommend a visit for either a meal or a drink. S$18 entry gets you 1 alcoholic drink and then pay more for meal. S$38 for the Asian Grilled Ribs which was a nice dish, nothing to rave about though. Some might say it's a bit expensive, however it is Singapore and Restaurants in Singapore aren't the cheapest. Also it's the experience - enjoy a meal 30 metres above the middle of the most beautiful Gardens. Service was good. As the restaurant is located in a "Tree" it is a bit cramped but we still enjoyed the experience
3
If you are planning to visit here, best time is at sunset and eat outside the resturant. at 7:45 or 8:45 PM, don't forget to watch the light show and come back and go their bar and have a drink. relax and enjoy the 360 degree view of the city.If you are in a budget, this is preferrable place than visiting or having a dinner at the Marina Bay Sand's KuDeTa.
5
I took my family here to eat and watch the light show from the balcony and it was majestic!!!The food is very expensive for its portion, but i guess they are charging you for the views, which never fail to impress!At one point when the music began and the light show had started on the trees, mum got very emotional from all the beauty on display.The staff were a mixture of helpful and not so helpful. I didnt get a chance to drink at the bar upstairs but it looked great when we walked up, so make time for that too
3
... we felt worthwhile !!! Instead of walking from one supertree to the next we thought of going up to the Supertree and having a drink at Indochine. The roof bar was closed and we were among the very few guests in the bar. We enjoyed the excellent view and went back upstairs after the Drinks (which were included in the price of going upstairs)
3
We chose this restaurant to celebrate my mother in law's 70th birthday. We booked well in advance and told them of the special occasion. The food was delicious - no complaints there. The service was hit and miss - some staff were extremely helpful, others were lukewarm... There was no effort from the staff to wish the birthday girl well on her birthday. Nothing to make the occasion extra special. What was surprising was the way up to the restaurant... You enter on the ground floor and pass through a narrow corridor to the lift. The corridor was dirty and haphazard and smelled a bit like garbage. The lift was also grubby. Once you enter the restaurant, the views (thank goodness!) almost make you forget the average entrance. The toilets were located near the kitchen and I had to sidestep empty produce boxes to get to the toilet entry. Glad we did it, but it could have been so much better
2
Amazing location right at the top of one of the super trees at Gardens by the bay. ten dollar charge for a soft drink and chance to sit at the bar. Hideous entrance full of tacky vases and ornaments. Dirty, smelly- definitely not luxuriant lift to the top. Chipped paintwork on the walls, tacky led features as you walk out. Stunning views and well designed outdoor circular walkway where you could sit if the weather is good. Most of the restaurant floor is for diners only but it was quiet and the staff said it was ok for me to 'do a lap' and walk around to see the full 360 degree view. Staff were grumpy and made the visit seem like an inconvenience- perhaps they pay more attention to the designers. However it was the restaurant fit- out that really bothered me. Just in really, really poor fast, fake flowers over sized coloured glass vases and sequinned cushions and table cloths. Looked like a really low rent bordello. Yuck- so offensive. Focus should be on the view and the service. Make your guests feel special. Couldn't wait to leave

Great views from this 'tree top' restaurant......but it comes at a price.
Meal for 3 with 3 bottles of water and 3 coffees just a tad under $300 SGD
1
Very poor service. We arrived at 4 pm for a drink but was not allowed to seat at table of our choice. The excuse given was that table was reserved for dinner! It is only 4 pm!
3
SG$28 to get in the lift which included a drink which you needed to forget about the price. Had a light snack while we were there - the cooked food was very good, the "fresh" seafood was not fresh it was previously frozen and very wet at over $100 overpriced for quality. I would have expected the lift cost to be credited if you ate there
3
We had been recommended to go eat here, so our friends made a booking for us. On arrival we were "allowed" to go up to the restaurant, when we walked in we were taken at how tacky everything looked and the flyers on the the tables for a honeymoon hotel was completely out of place. We were seated by the window as you would expect but could not see anything outside as the lights from inside were too bright. One of the reasons we were told to eat here was to see the light show performed in the gardens we saw nothing.Now it was not all bad as the food was very tasty and we did enjoy our meal.  What we didn't enjoy so much was how ridiculously overpriced the soft drinks were so we ended up just ordering wine and beer which was only slightly more expensive
3
So we came to IndoChine with a friend visiting from the UK. (We were big fans of the iconic riverfront restaurant which has sadly closed, although I'm still not sure why?). We had made a reservation for 3 for 8pm. We arrived at about 7.50pm but had to stand at the base of the supertree waiting for more than 5 minutes to be allowed to go up via the lift. This process could be speeded up, perhaps by having 2 separate queues/lines: one for diners, and a second for those paying $18.00 (!) to go up to the bar. We were seated by someone with a walky-talky, clearly communicating with the downstairs entrance fiasco. I'm uncertain as to who this gentleman was, but sadly he (and another lady with walky-talky) continued to walk past us throughout the evening talking loudly into said walky-talkies, with zero concern for the diners around them. That, together with the overly loud background music, did not lend itself to easy and audible conversation.We were handed un-opened menus (a pet-hate of my husbands) by a waitress and then left for about 15 minutes, eventually having to ask someone whether we could order. To be fair, the food came quickly and was very good. This sounds as if we were surprised. It's just that in our humble opinions, the restaurant currently has the ambiance of a blend of Disney with bordello. The decor is just not in keeping with what one expects from IndoChine. You have this sensational view, only to be obscured by the reflection in the windows of dozens of big Christmas-like baubles (and this is July!) hanging around the bar and other parts of the restaurant. Admittedly, on the website, it is advertised as having an "unobstructed view", but this is certainly not the case from inside the restaurant. The table linen looks cheap as do the chairs, which were purple-coloured velour and pretty uncomfortable. To add salt to the wound, they even had fake orchid arrangements everywhere . . . Really?! Orchids are Singapore! And if cared for, last several weeks, so why the plastic repros? On their website they claim that all plastic used is PET plastic, which is a good thing, but we are in the "Gardens" by the Bay . . . again, only our humble opinion.We would love to say that we would return to this restaurant but we're going to be honest and admit that unless there are some serious changes, that won't be happening. Good food, but it needs more than that to make for a memorable dining experience. But if you do go to dine, make sure you pay a visit to the bar upstairs. The views are sensational there but we didn't stay for a drink so cannot pass comment

We had been looking forward to trying this place for a while. So with friends in town we decided to go. We were so disappointed.The food was delicious, don't get me wrong. But that's where the experience ended. And living in Singapore, there are a lot of great places to eat and at better value for money.The decor was tacky. The music was inappropriate. The staff brought the wrong food and then tried to argue that we had ordered it; unusually for Singapore they hadn't read back our order after we made it - so will not make that mistake in the future. And given it trades on its views, the lights inside so bright, all you could see was the reflection of the tacky lights reflecting in the windows and ruining any view. Given how fabulous the rest of gardens by the bay are (we are members), this place was very disappointing. Next time we'll spend the money over the road. Avoid this place, it's not worth the effort or money

Our second visit as had an out of town visitor, so went for dinner at Indochine. Strange that kit's so difficult to wrangle a reservation, yet upon arrival there are several empty table. Views are nice, but warn your visitors wear flats as the mesh flooring can catch your heels!OK dining experience with the wagyu beef, Vietnamese fresh rolls with prawn, fried crispy whitebait, so-so ribs and pretty ordinary Indochine fried rice. Total for 3 pax was a not so value for money $218. Shocked that the Coke cost the same as my gin & tonic ($13.59 + 10% service + 7% GST) which is a total rip off.Popped up sans drinks to the rooftop bar to catch the night skyline. However put off ordering desserts and any more drinks. One waitress was sweet however and as we were taking shots, used her torch to add more light for the pic.Well we gave this restaurant a second chance, but in future, think I'll just pay the $18 alcoholic drink or $10 soft drink option
5
I proposed on a Sat night at the rooftop bar of Supertree after some drinks at the restaurant one floor below. My proposal was planned several months in advance and I collaborated with staff Harris and Jun. They were extremely helpful and were key to ensuring that everything fell into place on the actual day. Nearing and during the proposal day itself, I also worked with staff Wilson and Benjamin, both who were important to make sure the flow of events was smooth. I was so happy that my proposal was successful and that my current fiancee was so touched and elated. The staff at Supertree were certainly professional and deserves to be commended greatly
2
We were exploring Gardens by the Bay and came across IndoChine. $18 entry with alcoholic drink, $10 with soft drink. We went for the soft drink and headed up to the restaurant which was completely dead. We were able to order our drink straight away but that was where the service ceased - we were wanting to order food but we never saw a waiter again they were nowhere to be seen until we had just gotten out of the door leaving! The branches cover a lot of the view however we went up to the rooftop bar which was closed at lunchtime but to see the view which was stunning and walked around the top of the tree. Can imagine that this would be a great place to sit with a drink at night (if you ever got served)! As others mentioned the ladies bathroom was disgusting and felt like a staff toilet. All in all nonexistent service, feels like another tourist trap.

I had lunch here with a girlfriend. It was just lovely. we shared some entrees and found everything to be quite delicious. the setting is lovely, with views over Marina Bay Sands and out to the west and east coast. The staff were very professional and efficient
4
no need to rush, take in the good view of the sky line, over the bay, marine sands, outdoor park. nice morning out, with enjoyable breakfast.
4
Really good food in one of the supertrees. Good service and nice view, If you are not afraid of the heights you can sit and have a drink outside.
4
Took a chance and turned up here without a booking. Greeted warmly and given a table. Great views as one would expect from being on the 16th level of a man made tree. The menu had a wide choice. We shared an entree - this came promptly and was quite delicious. The mains followed after an appropriate delay. My Cambodian fish curry was full of flavour and spices were balance. My wife's meal was cod with lemongrass: very delicate. Wine list was broad but not huge - plenty to choose from. The staff were friendly and happy to chat. Yes, I would return

..Like, there are several levels of fail buried deeper than the fail you can see. So, you get dressed up in your evening best, and turn up at the Supertree. Its impressive enough. A great big man-made structure that resembles a metal tree. You go toward the entrance, its a bit like a lighthouse; theres a small door at the foot. There is a concierge there to check your reservation. The place is lit up like a christmas tree - all green and blue neon coming from these weird slightly tacky looking lights. But you know its an Indochine restaurant so you're not worried yet. They're all classy and stylish right? Wrong. So after the concierge confirmed your reservation, and sends you upstairs. You walk thru the entrance, and into the Supertree itself; a shabby corridor filled with useless bric-a-brac for sale at ridiculous prices. No one's actually in there, its just a passage to the lift which someone saw fit to fill with rubbish - literally. There were a few bags of garbage by the fire exit, and some builders stuff. You go up the lift. When you come out, there is another concierge - who inexplicably, checks your reservation again. Maybe because we managed to lie our way past the first concierge? Then you're shown to your seat...they walk you by the bar, and the first thing you notice is the green neon LED lights behind the bar - and we're not talking fancy fibre optics or something artistic; its basically the stuff you see at night markets. I can buy in Sim Lim for 30 bucks. Then you notice the christmas lights. Yes, Christmas lights. Great big clusters of them, cheap and tacky balls of glowing plastic hanging all over the place. Then you notice the green astroturf they've used as a kind of wallpaper. Then you notice that all of this serves to cause glare on the windows, so you can't actually see outside the spectacular view of Singapore skyline, you just see a reflection of stupid christmas lights. Then you see your zebra/cowpat mohair seat, and the disco ball hanging from the ceiling directly above you. The staff at least have the good grace to look embarrassed about it all, I mean, would you be happy about working a 10hr shift there? I really felt for them, and the demented designer that set that place up...service wasn't great, but I didn't have the heart to hold it against them. I'd be miserable if I had to work there too. The worst part of all this is that the food is actually excellent. Like, really nice! Indochine have several restaurants in Singapore; incidentally, one of them my boss took me to when pitching the idea of moving jobs to Singapore - their Boat Quay / Asian Civilisation Museum Indochine. That place had some impact in our final decision, it was that good. But the Supertree branch manages to brutally murder every possible endearing feature to it and turn what could be an award-winning restaurant into something cheap and annoying. In this respect it is a spectacular example of what a bad interior can do.Given there are some uber-slick restaurants in SG around that same price point (including their own branches!) its hard to imagine the incredible gall of the management; its like they sat down and said "there's someone with more money than taste born every minute, no one really cased about this stuff" and made it their business model.So, we didn't get dressed up to spend $100 a head on this, so we left after the starter and had a burrito at Muchachos instead. No regrets.I'm not usually this scathing on reviews, so here's something constructive to feedback to the management. Tear out every single fitting and fixture not utility or structurally necessary; paint everything not a window in white paint; get some simple wooden tables an chairs from ikea; put some tea lights on the table. And thats it. Let your spectacular view do the talking, don't try and shout over it - because that little voice saying you need zebra hair seating is not your friend. Possibly its the Great Deceiver

I came by on the dinner occasion with my love ones and we were amazed by the ambiance and the view from the outdoor seats of the restaurant. But it came to my disappointment when we had ordered two appetizers and two main course, the appetizers was served promptly but when it comes to the main course, my partner was served after 20mins once the appetizer was cleared. where as for mine, it too another 10mins therefore i have to wait a total of 30mins before my main course could be served. With a concept of a proper dining, shouldn't be the food timing be watched over and served in the timely manner and both main course should be both served at the same time instead of two different timing far apart. The best of all was that, the main course which i had order was the honey glazed asian baby back rib, the rib was so huge in size and the worst of all was the it was just 40% cooked. Just one piece of the rib i had and i called it off for the dinner. As i was calling for the bill and gave my card to settle the payment, i feedback the issue with the service staff to let the manager and the chefs knows about it but when the service staff came back with the bill all she could say was sorry for the ribs. As i was not trying to make a fuss out of it but the least of all, someone from the front line or the chef could at least give a simple reply instead of sending a service staff to say sorry. Once payment is made and thank the service staff for her service that night, i would know is that this restaurant sell itself for their environment not their service nor food
2
It started from it was impossible to book from website as it did not work and made the calls but no one picked up at all for many days. Apart from the good view, everything else is pretty very average from service to very poor food quality which did not match the high price. Food came out very fast as if it has been prepared and just heated before serving.The location and concept is great but it is pity to provide such a quality and standard. It will be hard to attract people to return

Took my Mum (visiting from overseas) for what was supposed to be a special lunch yesterday, but left angry I had wasted my time & money at IndoChine only to receive shocking service and poor food, not to mention their arrogantly overpriced menu!!We ordered a couple of side dishes with our main - the side dishes came out first and 15 mins later the mains had still not arrived. I sent the now cold side dishes back to the kitchen requesting that everything be served together as I wished my meal to be served hot.Another 15 minutes later, the main finally came and out and - knock me down with a feather - the exact same cold side dishes that I'd sent back to the kitchen made a reappearance!By this time I felt so defeated but pretty hungry, so we just ate the cold food (yes even main was cold) and undertook NEVER to return. Food nowhere near restaurant quality.The waiter brought us a free ginger beer as an apology for messing up the order â€¦ too little, too late!! Staff completely inattentive and clearly have no clue about customer service and good hospitality practice. A complete and utter disgrace IndoChine!!!!
4
The restaurant is located 16 stories high above ground with the view of the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, and the water. The views of night lights are simply breath taking. The food is delicious and the variety feeds almost every appetite. The Salmon Sashimi is very fresh and mouth watering. Laotian larb of king salmon appetizer was very delicious and tasty. The Green Papaya and Pomelo salads were nicely seasoned. The Pan-Seared Red Drum fish with Poached Pear & Roasted cashew nuts was delightfully prepared. The Lemongrass rack of Lamb was properly seasoned and cooked to perfection. All in all, a great gastronomical experience with breath taking views. The views at the rooftop bar is even more amazing
4
food - IndoChine quality / serving style / pricingstaff - attentive and friendly, not 'colour' preferential like the Clarke Quay branchview - it was great with possibility to walk out at the parapet for a better unrestricted view of the Gardenscrowd - mainly couples / business. we went there for company dinne

One of our friends treated us here for dinner a few weeks ago. We had the set menu. We had the Thai soup, which in my words, is not exactly Thai, as we had them in a traditional Thai restaurant before, and it tasted totally different. We had chicken, which was brilliant, and prawns which was just nice and not too oily. After dinner, we went to the rooftop bar for tea or coffee. The atmosphere was nice, though it was a bit too dark, to read the drinks menu
4
Timing service with well trained manner, pricey food, decent ambiance surrounded by the transparent glasses with the overlooking of gleamy trees. We paid about 180 SDG for 4 courses as you could see from the attached photo. Should be worth for both view and food. I don't mind come back again for the view at the roof top but not for the food since there are not many selection

After reading reviews on the Super tree Indochine restaurant we were indecisive on whether to go. We booked before our trip as we were told it gets very busy and booking is recommended. When arriving in Singapore we read a few new recent reviews and they weren't all good. But still deeded to go. Im so glad we made the right decision. It was lovely. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The service was what you would expect from a popular busy Singapore restaurant, but nothing wrong with that as the service was very good. The food was excellent and nothing to complain about. I had Peppered Garlic Wagyu beef and a mojito and my husband had the Lemongrass prawns and a martini all was great. To top the night off we watched the Supertrees show. The 2 meals and drinks cost AU$107.00 which I feel was worth it as the servings were quiet large. To sum it up well worth the visit. We will go again nest time in Singapore
2
Bad service, very expensive, food ok, they took more than 20 min just to come to the table and offer something to drink... They advertise some IndoChine hotels... For sure we will not go there. Do not waist your time and Money, Singapore has wonderful restaurants, this is not one of them, unfortunatel

We had dinner at this restaurant for my birthday last week and were very disappointed. It wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't as good as we'd hoped and totally over priced. However there is a nice open air bar on the top floor which also serves snacks and I'd definitely recommend a drink there for a great view of the city.In he restaurant, the views are quite good, and the service was quite friendly (some waiters were super friendly and others were not at all!) The service is very slow, as is typical in Singapore i.e. you have to ask for them to take your order etc. Seats are very comfy and there is a wide variety on the menu.However, what spoilt it for us was that my main course arrived and was stone cold. So I asked the waiter to take it back and heat it for me. He took it away and 10minutes later brought back a totally different dish! So we asked for my original dish back, but just hot. He didn't understand at all so a new waitress took over and sorted this for us. When my original dish finally arrived back again, now 20minutes later, it was still cold. In the meantime my rice had also gone cold and my husband had finished his main course. We did complain and to be fair, the manager agreed to remove the main course from our bill. But it was really disappointing not to be able to eat and to have the same dish (it was literally the same food) served cold twice! Added to that the food is over priced even by Singapore standards e.g. 30 -40 SGD for a main course, where the food is nice but not amazing
2
I was planning to have lunch here but decided against it once inside. They didn't have a menu downstairs so you couldn't see what they had on offer. The Supertree itself is so amazing. - as is the rooftop bar and view. When you want to go up to the bar you have to purchase either a soft drink or alcoholic drink ticket ($10 or $18 respectively.) I bought a soft drink token which got me a hideous tap ginger ale ... Not even fizzy. When I saw the menu I asked about ordering and was shunted to a table between two families with squalling, brats. I asked if I could exchange my soft drink voucher, pay the difference to upgrade to a glass of wine and was told this was not possible. Stupid. When I moved seats, the waiter was borderline rude and told me I couldn't go outside as it was about to rain. I realised that these people are restaurant people and have not been schooled in any from of tourism .they are working in a major tourist attraction and need to bit a bit nicer to guests who are paying a lot just to get into the restaurant. Needless , to say I didn't have lunch there in the end. This experience put me off trying their franchises anywhere else
2
This place has magnificent views, also to commend on the choice of music, the ambience is very relaxing.Needless to say this place could have very well been one of the best rooftop bars around in the city.Unfortunately though, the way this place is built, fumes from the restaurant kitchen one level below can be smelt at the rooftop bar. The night breeze from the sea direction isn't helping either. You actually get a constant breeze of 'kitchen fumes'. Whether the kitchen is deep frying seafood you could smell them at the rooftop bar.Not a really pleasant experience especially the kind of smell belong to kitchen fumes category rather than food aroma

Me, my partner and 2 daughters (18 & 17yrs) spent the afternoon walking around the beautiful gardens then stumbled upon this place. Entry was $18 for adults including a alcoholic drink and $10 for child including a soft drink (before 6pm). We asked the girl at the door if we could go in at 5:55pm and she said we would have to pay $18 each! We noted to her it wasn't 6pm yet but she refused and said we'd have to pay the after 6pm price. Pity for the restaurant because we were going to eat as well. Their loss. Sorry cant tell you what it's like insid

We found this during the day when we visited the park and cloud forest. Although we arrived in the rain it's not far to walk from the car park. We started with wine and delicious cocktails seated on bar stools overlooking the marina bay sands. Magical views.At the table we chose the signature platter plus two tapas which was plenty for 4. The tapas was well presented Vietnamese a mixture of fresh summer rolls , fried and steamed bites . Flavors were good . We followed this with shared coffee Brule, silky in texture with a good crust of caramelized sugar but let down by a low quality ice cream on the side.service was very good all night. Friendly and efficient. We particularly appreciated the suggestion to check out the roof top on the way out and the offer to take pictures of us on our phones. Wow is the only way to describe it, the gardens are lit up with the flyer and city beyond.Yes, the restaurant is a very eclectic and a bit overdone. Unlike all the beautiful plants in the gardens in here they are plastic. There is considerable glitz in lights, cushions etc but it is a magical place especially at night.We recommend this for a night out . Nice food, about $40 per person so expensive for what it was, plus expensive wine but this is not just dinner, it is the experience

Visited twice on a recent trip to Singapore. The location is very unique, and the views at night are spectacular from the rooftop bar. The food is of the highest quality and tastes divine, we particularly enjoyed the tapas menu and had most of the items on our two visits. The staff are lovely and remembered our names on the second visit. Make sure that you retire after your meal to the rooftop bar and take in the wonderful views with a cocktail or two

From the other reviews I've seen, it appears that many folks have had disappointing experiences. I'm happy to say that ours was great. After walking through Gardens by the Bay and experiencing the music and light show, we went to the Supertree restaurant and entered with no fee because of our reservation. We ate outside on cushioned sofas with a view of the city lights and started with Singapore Slings. I bet it's hot during the day but in the evenings it's very nice. Because of the way our table was positioned along the perimeter of the tower, we felt like we had the place to ourselves. Our food was very good (although expensive--but hey, it's Singapore), and our wait staff were very attentive. The waiter recommended the appetizer platter, which did make a wonderful initial impression. Our entrees and desserts were all very good and we shared them among ourselves. Unfortunately I'll probably never have the chance to go back to Singapore or eat at this restaurant again, but it was a special, magical evening I'll long remember

We paid the $10.00 (coffee included and as it was Chinese New Year, we got an orange too) entry fee to get to the top of the Supertree. The views are outstanding and some of our best photos were taken from here.
5
Eating at the top of a supertree on gardens by the bay was a nice experience and it was a really good food.
5
The view is spectacular, on the roof terrace even more. The food is good, but quite expensive.
The furniture is not really comfortable and has an 80s look and feel.
Their food at the locations at Clarke Kay and Waterfront are better!

Attracted by the location and also the food concept by IndoChine, went to have a relaxing lunch with my partner, food wise okay but could have be better, service wise good, location good... worth for the $, could have better value somewhere else with the price I paid without wine and alcohol drinks..

I tried in vain to book a table here but the website is not very responsive. However we did find ourselves in the Marina Bay Gardens very late one evening and decided to see if we could have a meal. The decor is definitely 80s disco! The meal itself came very promptly and the service was efficient - it was after 10pm. The food was nicely presented but nothing special taste wise. The view was somewhat obsured by the reflections of the many coloured which was a shame, but a trip to the rooftop bar provided fatastic views. The cocktails we had there weren't great but it didn't really matter as the view was so good. The roof is supposed to go around apparently but it broke a while ago possibly because there are not enough motors to support the weight

Nice detail and wonderful work of art. It's definitely worth the trip while visiting the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore.If you have the time, you can climb the tree & enjoy the scenery. Be a tourist for a day, take lots of beautiful pictures while you are there

After the serenity of Marina Bay Gardens I thought I could have lunch in an equally serene atmosphere at the restaurant in one of the super trees. The first Impression, after having paid an entrance fee of SGD 10.-- (redeemable for a soft drink) is that of entering a badly decorated disco: Mirror balls and wild fabric patterns are the main ingredients of the decor. Ordering lunch I was surprised to even have to beg for a paper napkin (there were no napkins on the laid table). When asking why, with the same menu (and the same prices) I get a proper napkin in the evenings, the reply from the waiter was: "The management is saving!"The food? Just OK. The view? - Mostly obscured by the building's structure
1
Great location, but nothing else. Although I can understand the entrance fee of $10, to stop everybody coming up to the restaurant just to take photos of the Gardens, I think $10 for a cooldrink is simply outrageous! We had lunch, which was good. I was amazed to be told that cloth napkins are only available for dinner and not for lunch guests although they pay exactly the same amount of money for what they eat! The decor is clearly done by a night-club owner, as it looks more at home in a nightclub than in a restaurant in the Gardens. Disco mirror- balls??? Try again. All I can say, it's not worth it. The view you can have from better places in Singapore, and even have a cloth napkin at that price

We were a little disappointed with our recent visit. Whilst the food was good, the service was lax and disjointed. I wish we had read the reviews before booking. This was a real shame as we had been looking forward to eating in such a unique setting after enjoying the SuperTree light show. It is expensive for what it is, but with a little effort this restaurant could be fantastic and would justify the cost. You are dining in a beautiful, almost surreal setting - it needs some good front of house staff to bring it all together

This is my second time to Singapore and my first time to Gardens by the Bay. I love Gardens by the Bay and I would say gardens by the bay is really enchanting. I went to the two domes and took the sky walk way. It was great. I was really enjoying myself taking many photos of this really beautiful city until I walked into Supertree by Indochine. My mood was completely tarnish. I would say this restaurant - Supertree by Indochine is a complete rat hole! As a walk-in guest, I was treated like a fly. Knowing that I was a walk-in guest, this particular host shove me aside and ask me to wait while she assist the guests on the reserve list. I did not understand why did the host at the ground level need to do so much walkie-talkie talking to check on tables when the restaurant is almost empty? When I reached the restaurant level, one Indian staff tried to take my order. This particular Indian staff was really arrogant. He tried to force me to order a main course when I insist that I only want tapas. While the indian staff look arrogant, he spoke like a mouse. I could not hear him at all when he was repeating my order. After he took my order, i observe that he went to tell another staff not to pay attention to me because I only order tapas. What kind of lousy, abhorrent, sucky attitude is this? Is this Indian staff the captain or what? Also the menu is very confusing - Indochine is like squeezing almost a dish from every country in their menu. When my food arrive, they were cold. The food are expensive and taste horrible. What kind of chefs they hire? Of all, the entire restaurant decorations look like a war-zone! Buddha heads' sitting on the wall. It is not worth the price at all! Very cheap table linen which I just saw at Chinatown were used. Extremely awful fake flowers and cheap looking plates and bowls - basically it is a rate hole! The staffs - Indian & filippinos spoke in terrible English which I could not understand. Really lousy & distasteful! I suggest all DO NOT STEP FOOT IN HERE! As an expat, I recommend you might as well go to coffee shops and hawker centres in Singapore where you can at least get some real tasty food and at least have a sincere but slow coffee aunty serving you. Supertree Indochine clearly is not a restaurant! Is it a coffee shop or hawker centre? Well, it is not good enough to be a coffee shop either! It is just a complete rat hole! DON"T GO! DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME! VERY SUCKY! Worst than terrible! On a fair note, only one thing is acceptable - Singapore's night view compensated for it at the rooftop bar
1
I was thoroghly disappointed with this restaurant, it is no where near quality of Indochine Empress PlaceThe food and service are terrible. The sauce on my fish tasted as though from a bottle.We asked for the three main meals to come ourt at one time as we were not sharing. They came out five to ten minutes apart. When we asked why they did not comply with our request to bring them out together we were advised " that is not the way we do things here"Will certainly not waste my time and miney with a return visit

It was simply great. It is almost impossible to describe the Super Tree by Indochine.After entering this impressive tree You ar warmly welcomed by one of the best teams running a restaurant. The are all best educated, they are real experts knowing everthing about the Food they offer, the wine they recommend. A great Choice of asien food, I prefered the Vietnamese dichtes prepared of the very best ingrediens. The Team always is decently looking if they can do anything for You.A very satisfying Choice of wines from all around the globe, perfectly served completes the perfekt service. All of the Team are warmly and nice and made us enjoying one of the best and nicest dinners WE have ever had.Almost I had forgotten the great views from the top of this artificial tree. You can follow the ships passing by, You have the best view of Marina bay Sands and the Financial District. Finally I wouldlike to mentioned the Manager and his charming deputy. Although die to the rain much more People had to get a table, they Managed this issue quite perfect. Always being polite, nice and recommending something good they had to make km. WE Never will forget this evening of the 4th of january. Thank You both and Your great team and see You in 2 weeks when WE will come again to enjoy the view, the food, the Service ......

I have gone to this place. It takes very long to get seated but i can see empty tables inside. When we ordered food, it took 10 minutes for the waitress to come to our table, then it took like 20 minutes for the food to come.The food is not super and the waitress was very slow. Before the waitress came to our table, she talked to another waitress for approx. 5 minutes so what is this?Overall, avoid this place
3
There is the option to have drinks and limited menu food on the roof. Beware rain and wind, no place to hide. It is a great experience and the entry price provides one drink. Everything has to be paid for. Food from the limited menu is expensive. The views are great and night the added attraction of lights. A lift saves walking up a lot of steps. If visiting the supertrees, it is worth the cost of this option. We did not eat in the restaurant and so cannot comment on that

I had dined in IndoChine restaurants at Empress Place and Club Street with business colleagues but my wife decided she wanted her first visit to IndoChine to be to their latest restaurant high above the trees at Gardens By The Bay to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary.The night started out badly with the taxi driver unable to find the restaurant and dropping us off at Marina Bay Sands and leaving us to walk there in the rain. Finally arriving at SuperTree we were greeted downstairs by a receptionist who called ahead to see if they could seat us and then directed us to a lift. The lift took us up to the restaurant where there were only 3 tables occupied and a number of empty tables which made us wonder why all the drama over two way radios downstairs. As always the menu was impressive but I was taken back by the wine list which was hardly inspiring and was incredibly expensive with the cheapest wines being $100 for wines that were average at best. The waiter appeared to struggle with his English and brought incorrect dishes that arrived very quickly and while the food was good it was in reality mediocre for the prices charged. The best thing about SuperTree is its location which was spectacular especially when walking around outside with the effect of the lighting and trees and view of Marina Bay. As my wife said it was a disappointing let down and not worth the effort of getting there or the price of the wine and food plus the service from staff was hugely disappointing
3
Fabulous location, and even the walk there was pretty spectacular with how the effects of light, trees and sound interacted to create a truly special atmosphere. The service was OK only. Food, nothing special, so don't expect too much of a 'dining' experience per se. I sat outdoors, which formed a narrow, circular walkway with tables line on the peripheral. This turned out to be the highlight of the night for my date and I because we could just immerse ourselves with more of the magical setting at Gardens Bay
1
What a disappointment! This fabulous location could have been the setting for a wonderful dinner but sadly not. We booked tables inside but on arrival, already disappointed at the restaurant interior, we were seated next to a very noisy large group. The waiting staff acknowledged this and offered a table outside which we gratefully accepted. Sadly it continued to go down hill from there. Our four main courses were delivered, two were not what was ordered and three were cold. We decided not to worry too much about the incorrect dishes and focus on getting some hot food. It was returned to us slightly warmer but not hot. When we asked for the rice to be replaced as that too was by now cold, we were met with a disapproving look from the waitress! At this point I decided to let her know that she had already served two incorrect main courses! The food was mediocre at best. What a waste if location! Dont bother with this place.

What a fantastic frame to enjoy your sunset in Singapore. I absolutely loved it. You can pay S$ 18 for entry plus an alcoholic drink or reserve your table. We decided not to eat here as the menus does not look particularly appealing and actually quite expensive for simple courses, but I would definitely recommend it for a drink at the sunset when the city lights switch on
5
It was suggested to us by the friendliest taxi driver in Singapore to have dinner at the top of the SuperTree, thanks taxi driver as this was such an unexpected wonderful surprise which I will remember always. It was a beautiful walk through the trees in the evening after watching the light show, such a magical place at night. We had a late reservation for 9.30pm as we booked last minute that afternoon, but when we checked with th attendant at the ground level about an hour early they had availability already and were allowed up the elevator to the indoChine restaurant for dinner. The best thing was that our table for 2 was not inside the restaurant but outside on a very narrow walkway (similar to a maintenance walk way) around the outside of the restaurant. Probably not the best for those not great with heights but if your ok with it, highly recommend this. If you want to remain inside make sure you confirm this when booking reservation as we had no idea. Food was nice, not amazing but still pretty good. Check out the open air rooftop bar before you leave, if for nothing else for a picture of the view, amazing
5
The view was amazing. Food was nice and reasonable for a restaurant of its type. Such a novelty to have a meal and drink in the tree. If you are having a meal, remember to tell them before you enter so you don't double up paying for just a drink and look. We were caught out
5
Like to visit supertree almost twice a mth with my hubby. Cos it hv marvelous view . Feel so relaxing at d rooftop after taking our dinner at d . Downstairs . Love this place so much!

Arrived at the SuperTree IndoChine restaurant at dusk, hoping to get a table. We were told we could dine but that we had to be out by 8pm, which gave us just under an hour. The view was great, but felt very let down by the service of the staff and it was not a relaxed experience. The Indian waiter got our order wrong, and tried to insist that it was what we had ordered, when clearly it was not, even bringing the offending plate back a second time, trying to make us take it. I had ordered the fresh spring rolls for my pre-schooler, as she will not eat the deep fried kind, which is what they had brought. I know exactly what I had ordered, but they tried to make it look like my fault. After being treated like that, we had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct order to come, and since we only had the table until 8pm it all just felt rushed. While I was eating my green papaya salad, (which I could not share with my child due to the chilli), my child kept asking me where was her food, and I kept having to explain hers would be here soon. It did not come until I had already finished my meal.We stayed till around 8:15pm and the restaurant was half empty, so I don't see why we had been given the time limit, of only being allowed the table for less than an hour, until 8pm. We will not be back, I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant ever. If they muck up your order they will try to insist that you take the dish, and will not admit their mistake, neither an apology. Eat somewhere else if you want to be served by staff that care about your experience

The Indochine chain is ubiquitous here and this is the best food I've had out of the three I've tried. The sharing platter had two varieties of rice paper rolls which were fresh and nice, a delicious oriental scotch egg, a betel nut leaf stuffed with beef, not quite so nice, and a rather soggy deep fried fish. We supplemented with some BBQ squid, not as soft as it might have been, and a papaya salad which was better than its sister in Holland village. However, it is rather shocking that the restaurant is decorated throughout with fake flowers - situated as it is In one of the world's premier gardens, a glass of wine at $20 is pretty steep

Firstly I just loved gardens by the bay and didn't realise there was a restaurant at the top of one of the tree houses until I researched on line. This restaurant is unlike no other it is definitely an experience, we chose to sit outside on the small wired balcony the views of the Singapore flyer, marina bay sands and the gardens lit up at night were incredible. We watched the gardens light show and vaguely saw the MBS light show too. It really does have the wow factor.The menu had lots of choice and the food was good, service was quick and the staff were friendly always checking we had everything we needed. They even suggested we could have our deserts brought up to the roof top bar and we finished our meal there, again incredible views with pleasant friendly staff. It is a bit pricey but you are paying slightly more for location and in my opinion Singapore overall is an expensive place anyway and when you compare that location in London or Dubai where we live it's similar prices. Would highly recommend, also remember to make a reservation
3
Went mid week. Location and the concept are great. Seating inside is a little cramped and hard to ignore the staff constantly rushing behind. Food was good and all dishes were well presented. Experience was let down by very poor service. Would try the food again at one of their other locations.
4
The view from this restaurant was fantastic, it wasn't a large restaurant and there were indoor and outdoor tables. Not really suitable for children even though we took our 14 month old grandson who behaved very well. Because of the set up I would not recommend young children under about 10. The food was very good, not the best I have ever had but the pork and lychee entree was really delicious. I felt they were moving people through fairly quickly. Staff were pleasant. We could have then gone up to the rooftop bar for a drink for an even higher view but chose not to. You did not have to pay to go to the bar if you had a meal
4
Great venue either for drinks on the rooftop bar (pay entry includes one drink) - we watched the national day practice from here and generally great views of MBS and the riverside. Doesn't seem to get too busy either even at weekends. Also enjoyed a team dinner in the restaurant. We took over half the restaurant and they set up a buffet for us - sushi, fresh spring rolls, prawns, salads for starter and then a mix of indo-chinese main dishes and delicious sliced beef. The food kept being replenished and our team was very full. Cocktails were pretty good too. For the drinks and food combination it's almost as good as Level 33 or 1 altitude. Only slight downside is the downstairs area you walk through to get to the lifft - there's a strange unpleasant damp smell and very odd display of glassware
5
I guess the restaurant is also great, but I went straight up to the rooftop bar on top of the super-tree. The view is absolutely marvelous.The entry fee is 18 SGD and includes a dring, which is fair.Beverages, snacks and cocktails are available directly on the rooftop bar
3
We love The Indochine on the waterfront near Empress place so decided to try the Supertree. The food was ok nothing out of the ordinary, service was polite but they were short of menus for guests on other tables and we were asked for ours whilst still looking at them. We were also asked if we wanted dessert before we'd been served our main course although to be fair I think the waiter was new. The menu to me doesn't live up to the standard of the other restaurant I mentioned, there are no noodle dishes or curried dishes on it.......yet there is a dish with feta cheese which I found strange. I'm all for fusion and something different but think you are trying to be too different with this menu and it doesn't work. Also being a big coffee lover I was disappointed with the cold, bitter coffee served in a stainless steel prison style cup. The view was great but there are much nicer places in Singapore with better quality food and equally stunning views. This is definitely a 'Tourist' gimmick
1
A very expensive ride in a battered elevator, is how I am summing up this experience. 10dollars to get up there and have a soft drink... Wanted to eat in the restaurant but was not informed by the ticket lady downstairs, who spoke broken English, that we would only be able to get tapas... found out only at the top, after having paid the fee. Tapas were less than average at best, and horrendously overpriced. Service personnel was indifferent and arrogant towards customers and did not care about our experience at all. Felt like being treated like a walking wallet. I cannot recommend this as a place to eat to anyone.
3
Service was good but the food was disgusting, food franchise style food premade no real sense of flavour and the price was extreme for the (quality) if that's what you can call it. Save your money and palate for something better... Should have tripadvisor first......
5
Stumbled on this by chance and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. If there are only two of you sit outside the restaurant as there are small tables out on the rim on top of this Supertree. If you go up at sunset the views are truly wonderful. I had smoked duck and my husband had beef - both meals were truly outstanding as was the service. We mentioned to the waiter how happy we were with the view and he told us it's even better just above us in the bar and if we wished he would serve our desert up there. We took his advice and amazingly it was even better. The bar is open to the sky and the ambience of the whole place was fantastic. Although there were a number of people there - they had enough seats and the service was superb. Would definitely go there again. It wasn't particularly cheap but well worth every cent we paid and we would surely go back again
4
We arrive for a late dinner at 9.30pm. GRO was good, suggested an outdoor table which the kids loved. Food was yummy too but expect prices to be a little higher. Portions were good, we ordered 2 tapas, 2 mains and a salad and it was filling. We fed 2 adults, a 16 & 9 year old. The outdoor seating, we had a sofa corner, very cosy but service can be a hassle as the staff don't usually look out and waving for them through the glass windows can be a little wait. The younger staff are friendly and made an effort to interact with us. We will certainly return with friends for the good food and wonderful view. With drinks and taxes we spent about S$250You can always enjoy the bar on the upper deck at S$18 a head. Just remember its open to the elements
1
Chair backs are broken, the menu pages are grubby and torn. Service terrible; you need to find someone to serve you, they never bother to return and offer you anything. We decided not to order any food after this expertise and then the bill...... USD$40 equivalent for one small beer, a coke and a bottle of still water!!! Don't bother going up there
4
I was asked to organized a business dinner for a group of 10 guests from UK, after much asking around with couple of people, I decided to bring them to SuperTree by IndChine.First off...food...in fear of ordering the "wrong" things, the guests suggested that each person order 1 dish and share around. They ordered (without knowing the name of the dish, eg. Kampong Chicken) more than 11 main dishes with fried rice & plain rice to fill the "gap", it was indeed an excellent idea, ironically, it was more like they wanted more of most dishes but there were not enough to go around for 2nd serving. In summary, the food is excellent.Secondly...the ambience of the restaurant, it was deemly lit and has a romantic feel around the area. There were pillows for those that are seated next to the window, it's probably good for people that are smaller frame but not ideal for the bigger frame guests as it reduce the area they can sit...so they were trying to shaft the pillows around and they end up piling the pillows (which keeps dropping on the floor) on one of the empty seat.We have made couple of attempt to ask the staff to remove the pillows, but no one seems to be interested. Apparently they were using a lift to send food (through a window) up to the restaurant, and we saw this guy having problem with the food and ended with all the food spilling down the lift chute with lots of clanks and bangs...not sure if it's a people issue or the design of the lift needs to be reviewed, it's definitely a talking point for the guests as couple of them were seated right infront the lift.Thirdly, ambience of the rooftop bar, we were lucky that the night was cooling, it was unanimous that the views was fantastic with Marina Bay Sand, Singapore Flyer, Keppel port, rest of Singapore skyline in sight; we can also clearly see the brightly litted F1 pit, I highly recommend you to check out this place even if you are no intention to dine in the restaurant. I understand that you pay S$10 to get up to the rooftop; it's free if you dine in.Finally, Service...the level of service was not consistent, depending who you approach; in the restaurant, the captain is good and helpful while you can see the staff are trying. On the rooftop, the staff are not as attentive and seems to have their own time chatting before they start walking around to check on their customers.On the whole, it's probably a good place to go if you have foreign guests for business, but I will think twice if I am with my family, as the price are quiet hefty

We ate here by accident after visiting Gardens By The Bay and looking for an early family dinner. I had poorly researched options and mistakenly thought there were several dining options in the Supertree.Nevertheless, we arrived at 6:20 pm without a reservation and with 2 children under 5, we asked if it was "too fancy" and were told we were fine to dine there.We were given a table outside (presumably so we wouldn't disturb others), but we found sitting outside preferable, weather was pleasant and the views fantastic. Service was attentive. We ordered a selection of tapas to share. Admittedly we hadn't eaten out much in Singapore but we found the food to be delicious. It was expensive but all up we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
3
This has to be one of the most spectacular locations for a restaurant anywhere in the world, at the top of a "tree" at Gardens by the Bay with awesome views in all directions, both water and city. The views from the roof bar above are even more dramatic.Food was ok, but doesn't do Singapore justice, being one of the world's great dining spots.The mixed entree platter for 4 was very good, though for some unfathomable reason often had 6 pieces.The main courses were only average ... Lamb dish very good, pork larb dried out, fish tasteless, steak ok.The decor is too kitsch to be true, and such a wonderful setting deserves better than having the chef's girlfriend do the fittings.If we go back, it will be to the bar on the roof for the spectacular view of a beautiful city, rather than for the food or decor
4
For location, views and unique-ness, this is hard to beat. For food, it is quite good but not amazing. Like the Indo Chine at the Waterfront there is a bit of cheesy nonsense about bio/nutriant food but mostly a load of pseudo babble. But it is great Asian fusion cooking, well presented, cooked and a wide and imaginative choice. The bar at the top is large and the views stunning. Sit there with a cocktail and watch the night come in. The lights of the city are complemented by the thousands of stars of the ships moored in the sea

6 of us recently had dinner here while visiting Singapore. While trying to make the reservation they were very fussy about available and time. However, upon arrival we found only a very few people. So not sure why they were so snotty about availability and times. While I don't have a lot of criticism regarding the food, I would simply say it was good, not out of the world and very expensive. My comments have more to do with the setting and the decor. This is a very unique site, but the interior and the decor have absolutely no relationship with the unique environment that the restaurant is in. To say it is garish or even weird doesn't do it justice. My guess is that the wife or girlfriend of some executive at the restaurant company got the job of decoration. This company should rethink the interior and aline the inside of this restaurant with the location
5
Had a great time with my girl at Indochine in Gardens By the Bay. There are reasonable items on the menu, though the steaks are prohibitively expensive. Service was good, though they leave you alone so much that you might need to seek help when looking for a check. Food was good, not phenomenal, but you're there for the ambience and the view. Most unique views in Singapore.Make a reservation and go early for the rooftop bar. If you go just to the bar, I think you pay $18 and that includes one drink. If you have a rez, entrance to the bar is free
4
Three of us ate here for lunch for $132.00. We split 2 appetizers, 2 entrees & two bottles of water. The food was good, but not worth what we paid. They really jab you on the price.
5
We noticed the restaurant from above, while on the Sky Park, so when we returned to the Gardens by the Bay we grabbed the opportunity to go "up in the tree".
2
We tried the Super Tree in August 2013 based on our very good experience with the river restaurant. First we had to pay 18 S$ to get in (one basic drink included) The entrance looks very basic, more like a basement with a few items as advertisement. For sure you don't get the impression of a fancy or chic place. We went up with the elevator by our own, there is nobody showing you the way. On the roof top we found a rather small terasse. The menu is quite comprehensive, the food was ok, but not exciting, prices are rather high. When we were there the place was (Saturday evening) half empty and the service was terrible slow. Also the atmosphere was nothing special.Overall we don't recommend this place. If you want to have a great view we prefer to go to the bar on Marina Bay Sands or 1 Altitude.If you want to have decent food you better go to the Indichine at the riversid
4
My wife and family surprised me with a trip to the Treetop Indochine at Gardens by the Bay.My wife was worried about some of the previous reviews but for us they were unfounded as the place was lovely...food was well cooked and the Stuffed Lychee balls were simply stunning.The rooftop bar for desert was absolutely stunning....what a great place and lovely and helpful staff
4
This is a very modern restaurant in a spectacular setting. The decor is unusually garish for a romantic dinner but wonderful for a late night party. The food was excellent and the view from the bar above was equally impressive.One thing let the experience down, the girl working at the bottom of the Supertree. Not very friendly or bright and even when I pointed to our reservation she still had to radio someone and keep us waiting
4
I have never been a fan of Indochine until SuperTree.We made reservations for dinner but proceeded to the open rooftop bar for evening drinks before dinner. The view was wonderful as it had an unrestricted 360Ëš view from the sea to Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We later proceeded to the restaurant a floor below and it is reminiscent of a revolving restaurant as it had the same layout. Food was remarkably good and innovative although perhaps not authentic. The good thing about SuperTree is the staff who were attentive and do their best to serve.A very nice experience and it would be a great place to revisit again
4
We visited for dinner on our honeymoon.Sitting outside on the platform, we were very well looked after by our waiter, who helped us chose a very pleasant meal and brought the food at our requested pace.It is the setting that makes the restaurant so special. Set in the middle of the Marina Bay Gardens, atop the tallest of the "tree" towers, the outside seating is gloriously tranquil and affords fantastic views on all sides. Not a venue for those who suffer from vertigo, but otherwise heartily recommende

Went there today with a group of 12 for lunch. The food was surprisingly good, but the service, lousy. The food arrived sporadically. They recommended that we order some rice to go with the steamed cod fish, but the cod fish arrived alone sans rice, and we waited for about 10 to 15 mins for other orders to arrive. We asked the waitress to serve the rice and she gave some lame excuse that they had intended to serve the rice with all other orders together. Strange way to handle customers. We were there at noon and by 1.30 pm, we were just done and they cleared our plates quickly and showed up with our bill without our asking. The waitress gave some reasons and at first we thought she was trying to tell us that their cashier is closing and we needed to settle the bill first, which is reasonable. However we realised she had wanted us to leave as they needed the tables back for a group of tourists who have arrived. We asked the if it was their policy to limit the time for a table and they said yes, 2 hours is the limit. We said we were not informed about this time limit when we called for reservations, and he ever insisted it is the restaurant's policy. We told them it was only 1.30pm by the way. In a nutshell, the restaurant has good food (kudos to the chef) but bad service management. We were at first talking of coming back to the restaurant again, with the bad finale, we will never come back again for sure.

We swung by 'Gardens by the bay' straight after our Singapore flyer visit.Naturally, it was already late by then but we ventured around anyway.We came upon the beautiful 'Avatar - styled' glowing blue towers and boy - were they magnificent!Behold! One of these gorgeous towers was a rooftop bar! We naturally went upstairs to see the views...There was not one ounce of regret in our bodies - the views were mind blowing. And this is straight after we visited the Singapore flyer too.Definitely worth the visit to see the gorgeous Marina Bay Sands right in front of us. The cocktails and snacks were nice - but certainly no big attraction.A "must-go" for the views

What a unique setting! It's a delightful ambience in this circular restaurant on the top of a super tree. Don't walk out on the wire balcony if you have a fear of heights! Even if you don't, you get a li'l lightheaded and dizzy. Do check out the bar one floor above in the open air bar. Get your camera ready for some great pics - beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer. The food was tasty Asian fusion. The appetiser sampler, fried yam rice, pepper steak were all delicious.

Very good food n nice views . We will back for dinner again . Love tis place so much. D. Rooftop views so awesome !

As a previous resident of Singapore I was a frequent visitor to Indochine locations. This was the first trip to SuperTree. Disappointing. Amateur service, indifferent food. Proof that you should avoid restaurants which have a great view (except for Vue de Monde!)
4
We visited during the time of the haze so it was not crowded at all and that was the best part. :-)The lady purser confused us a bit by saying that the bar was closed but eventually we clarified as I had made a reservation.The rooftop offers an unblocked and 360 degree view of the bay and it is a beaitiful sight.Indochine food portions are generally decent and our food turned out to be good as expected.I am definitely going there with friends again next week and I hope it turns out to be as good as the last time. It is place I would love to visit again

I can not write about the food because we only go for the view and the coffee (included in the SG$10,00 ticket for person). The view, indeed, is great, you can see the whole bay and gardens and can seat in front of the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Sands Hotel. The coffee was terrible, very average quality, able to ruin the moment. If you are not eating, better enjoy the view and forget the coffee

We visited Supertree for a nice meal celebrating birthday. The dinning experience is superb, we had some finger food and a main course. The quality of the food is as expected of Indochine, good quality. The portion is good enough for 2 to share.The pricing is not the cheapest within Gardens by the bay, but the view is 2nd to none.I would go again just for a drink and impress some one.My suggest is to book the dinning area for dinner.Go up to the pub for a pore dinner drink, and see the city over sunset.Have dinner at the dinning area and ask for the desert to be served at the pub.Enjoy desert while enjoying the night lights of the cit

Location, is second to none, the setting beautiful, but that is the best we can say about it!! We went for my husband's birthday thinking we would have something special to remember and what we got was short of what we expected. My meal was over cooked, but my husband had a Rack of Lamb that he said was beautifully cooked, but for the price of the meal and drinks, it should have been an excellent meal and mine fell well short of excellent. If you have deep pockets and can splurge on a mediocre meal then the views are spectacular, the night lights in the garden with the trees is stunning. But service and the meals not worth the money!

Located at the top of the super tree in the gardens by the bay, you could not get a better spot for drink or meal. We recently had lunch there and once you go up in the lift and take-in the view of the gardens and across to the Marina Sands Hotel. The day-core inside is very funky and colourful. The food menu at lunch was good with a good range of diverse food including tapas, salads and platers. The only thing that let place down was the staff, seemed to be full of young inexperienced staff, from the base of the tree, when they let you in, the guy had no idea if tables were available or not, when we got into the restaurant we were greeted and sat down, but service feel away from there on, seemed to be plenty of staff standing around but no one coordinated the service. We had one waitress stand behind the table next to us waiting for them to do something but gave no service to us, very strange. Even with poor service i wouldn't let it stop me from going
1
we decided to spend an evening in one of the top attractions in singapore. the treetops is definitely a great location for an evening drink, but the restaurant and service is a disaster. They had to change order twice as the they ran out of lamb after ordering. It took ages to serve the food and the food was cold. Its way too overpriced
4
We have visited as part of our Gardens by the Bay visit. The entry was $10 per person which entitled to a free non alcoholic drink upstairs. We ordered the IndoChine platter which states for 4 but we asked if we could have it for 2. The food was nice and the waitress kept on coming back with more iced water. If you are hungry the platter was 4 would be fine for just two people or as an entree if halfed.We sat in the restaurant which was fine as it was so hot. We went to the rooftop afterwards just to take few photos. We will be back in the evening to sit at the rooftop bar and have a drink or two as the views are amazing
1
We love other Indochine locations but supertree was a letdown. The service was poor the restaurant was cluttered and worn down looking (especially considering it is new.) Food was good. The kicker was facilities that were unusable for the ladies because they were so disgusting. Just not what you expect for the price.
5
Great views, food and service. We had a fabulous lunch and then went to the rooftop bar to enjoy the stunning views.
5
The food is incredible, though a little on the pricey side. Best to come for a beer and small bite, but worth the stop.
4
We visited the Gardens by night and were blown away by the amazing sight of these lit up structures. We walked up close and were amazing to find that IndoChine have a restaurant & bar at the top of the largest SuperTree. It is $18 to go up to the top (by lift) which includes a free drink (not that unreasonable for a glass of wine) and the views from the rooftop bar were just spectacular - Singapore at night is stunning. We tried some of the tapas - not expecting anything special and they were really delicious which was a bonus. We had the veggie spring rolls and the chicken wings - the portions were large and we were able to share. Fabulous evening

My colleague and I had palmed to impress our European guests by taking the, to this new Restuarant on a week night in late April. On arrival we were advised that we were more than 15 minutes after our reservation time and that our table had been given away. We were then asked if we be okay to sit outside. Whilst disappointed we then continued upstairs and were asked to wait whilst our table was prepared. We were then seated at a table inside the air-conditioned part of the Restuarant, possibly because the Restuarant was basically empty. After this the dinner failed to improve. We had to constantly seek out staff for service. Our meals were not prepared as requested and with four people at the table, it was 10 minutes between the delivery of the first and last main meal. Of course you can always overlook the meal and concentrate on the unique location and view however due to the exterior facade and cabling the views, at least at night, is not that impressive. This is not a cheap Restuarant and certainly not up to the standard of an Indochine Restuarant
4
Had a nice dinner here after visiting the gardens and viewing the Supertrees. Located in the largest Supertrees, the location is the main story, but the various types of Asian appetizers and mains were actually pretty nice. Had a glass of wine which was good, but perhaps the smallest glass of wine ever served. The service side could be improved, but it was still a nice overall experience dining here

Just found some of the previous reviews and I have to sadly agree that this gorgeous venue has been let down by Indochine. I love their Empress Place/Clarke Quary restaurant and bars but this is a sore point in their portfolio.I too hope the management read and take action. I felt sorry for the girl at the ground floor who's job was obviously to create an air of exclusivity by limiting the no of people up at the same time. OR could it be the staff couldn't juggle the tables?However after 10 minutes, we like 2 other groups with reservations, had to by pass her to get to our booking on time. Lovely view, mediocre food. DON"T wear stillettos, the outdoor seating area around SuperTree has mesh netting on the floors and ladies will find themselves scrapping their Jimmy Choos. Popped up to the open air bar for the best unobstructed view of Singapor

Went to Supertree last night for a special dinner with my wife. What attracted me to this place despite the negative reviews was the varied cuisine which is a concoction of Thai, Laotian and Vietnamese cuisine amongst others. In terms of atmosphere, the place has unfortunately become somewhat of a tourist destination which apparently necessitated the restaurant to post someone downstairs to vet people downstairs (not sure if they charge a fee if you don't go upstairs to drink or eat). Anyway, I had made reservations but the girl downstairs couldn't find it initially and wasn't too subtle in her approach. Once we cleared that hurdle however, we quickly made our way up to the restaurant where the experience and the level of service quickly improved in terms of food and service, although the decor could be improved to fully realise the potential of this magnificent building with its amazing views.First the good aspects though: the service from the waiting staff was very friendly and they were not pushy at all. They even suggested that we take only a half seafood platter, even though we had already ordered the platter for 4 (not knowing we could opt for a 2pax platter). The staff even re-opened a section of the restaurant that they had closed for the night (we arrived late) for us so we could get the view we wanted.The real highlight of the night however was the food. The seadood platter was great and consisted of super-fresh oysters, scallops, mussels, shrimp (although they weren't the advertised tiger prawns) and salmon. The seafood was accompanied by great sauces! We also had a very tasty kampong chicken dish and tasty beef 'carpaccio' (a take on larb nuea). One dish however did not impress and is one we will not order next time we visit. The tom yam was quite bland and generic and did not have the wow-factor of the other dishes. Many people complain about the price of drinks, however we had a decently priced Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc at SGD90 (which is not unreasonable for Singapore). One cocktail we had as an apperetif (I can't remember the name but it contained vodka and lychees) was very tasty and refreshing.The one aspect of the restaurant that I found disappointing is the decor. It feels like the interior is one big disjointed collection of items scraped together during yard sales from different families. I don't mean to offend anybody but I don't see the aesthetic design principle behind the chosen interior design or the quirkiness that may have been intended with this approach. I believe a slightly more minimalistic and modern asian interior with more subdued lighting (now the lights are too bright and reflect against the window, distracting from and obscuring the great scenery outside) would do this place much more justice and support the delicious food and gorgeous views.

I took my mother from NZ to this restaurant to show off Singapore to her. 6 of us had dinner at a cost of just under $1,000 ($964)! We turned up at 8.30 for our reservation to be told table not ready, at 9.10pm they asked if we wanted to sit outside (it was raining) as people still at our allocated table. Eventually got our table and had to ask for menus, enough cutlery and for our wine to be refilled through the night. The food was good but over priced. The service and tacky decoration is not worth the price. Bit of a let down given it's location
2
This is a review for Supertree Dining. It was late at night and we had no other dining option, so we had to enter some place around the Gardens by the Bay. The ambiance was quite good, but the food was very ordinary. As expected, the prices were steep... To my surprise, even the service was slow and inefficient. My experience is similar to some of the recent reviews. I would suggest avoiding this place
2
We booked a table outside, which was the first mistake, the tables are very low you cannot get your legs under which made it uncomfortable to eat at. They offer 2 draught beers,, so my husband asked for a pint of Tiger, you can only have a pint of Heineken apparently! The waiter didn't know what the house wine was, and couldn't explain meals on the menu. It took 1/2 for our starters, my husband ordered sashimi and I had the scallops, his arrived 5 mins before mine, instead of them being served together. All in all the service was very poor and the food was over priced for the portion sizes. Considering that the Gardens by the Bay is one of Singapore's top attractions I would expect the Indochine Group to answers people's comments on Tripadvisor and be trying to move up the ratings, i live here and would not recommend this to anyone and am now put off going to their other restaurants

Great location for dinner on the open rooftop. Food is priced somewhat high, but great quality and worth it for the location. Above average service also.
1
This place is a scam. You get charged when you walk in based on their minimum spend. Once you get up the top the place is eclectic and tacky with poor service. The view isn't even that good. Anyway, for $10 I received 250ml of non- carbonated post mix coke. Times this by five as I had guests and you will see this is a scam played out on tourists who will not be coming back. Unlike other places Supertree do not need repeat business due to a steady stream of daily punters. Obviously this plays to the lazy arrogant attitude of this joke of a place. Apart from people having dodgy soft drinks, the place was empty. An embarrassment to the rest of Singapore
2
We went up to the rooftop bar for pre-dinner drinks and were amazed by the 360* view and thought it was going to be a great night! No doubt about that. But when we were given the drinks menu, we were shocked by the price, definitely way above the average.We next went down to the restaurant, and were made confused by the wait staff whom messed up our reservations. We were finally given a table but the view out to the garden was non-existent. All we could see were light reflections from the restaurant internal. Without the view, it was just an ordinary night out at an expensive restaurant that has no standards. And yes, dinner was expensive for near cold starters and mains. We could easily have food like these somewhere else.The restaurant's decor was a mix and match of safari, zen, contemporary and everything they could find. Could definitely be improved.Overall, I will be there just for drinks, simply just to take in the view at the rooftop. If I could get away without ordering drinks, I would certainly do so. Apart from this, nothing else..

The location, views, uniqueness of the place should make for an incredible experience, instead you are left with the sour taste of a missed opportunity. Why woudl you come here other than for teh "unique experience"? Then it's easy, exploit the uniqueness, showcase it, rather than make it cumbersome and erratic. The bar at the rooftop is the best thing, open views of Marina Bay Sands the port, the skyline, all fantastic. The decor is good and the service just OK, but they make you pay an entrance fee if you do not have a dinner reservation... so they are treating a bar like an attarction!!. That's so wrong. You are charging $19 SIN for a martini so that should be enough. Anyone that goes up will have at least a drink and you can easily enforce this by greeting all guests when they arrive and ask them for their order. You do not need to charge a fee! Really tacky.Then, one floor down to the restaurant. Half empty. Waiting 10 minutes for our table as the were confussed as to what table was ours. They passed us around to 3 different people and with at most 12 tables in the restaurant they could not figure out where to sit us. So, you are sitting in a restaurant whose only selling point is its location and the views, so what do you do? you light the bar up so much that you cannot see the ouside and only see the reflection of the interior lights and the bar against the glass panels. You just cannot see the outside!!! Are you kidding me?? Ok, maybe they have good food. Wrong again! They have standing menus with "offers" in the middle fo the table, like in a cheap cafe! It is just so classless and tacky... I could go on but I feel bad for the place. So much promise wasted away. A good professional will turn this into an incredible hot-spot and business, instead it is a monument to carelesness and missmanagement. It is sad.D0n Trave

We ate reasonably well at this restaurant, and the waiters who served us were charming. However it has flaws. We arrived 5 minutes after our booking time and were told the table was not ready so sent to have a drink on the floor above - great view but why was the table not ready ... the restaurant was far from full. Then you cannot get a taxi on departure as they will not come in the evening to Gardens by the Bay ... so you are packed off to find your way to Marina Bay Sands - a good walk and what if it had been raining? Surely a complementary bus or golf buggy is called for here? And better organisation behind the scenes
2
We wanted to have drinks in the restaurant due to the fabulous view but had to pay a fee in advance before going upstairs and then were given no real choice as to what we could drink. The very small beer and glass of wine were very poor value. When we queried this we were told that the payment was an admission fee to the restaurant and the drink complimentary. This was at the very least misleading and rather dishonest.I can understand that they want to put off people who want to look at the view and purchase nothing but I would certainly not be inclined to even try the restaurant if this is how they treat potential customer
5
A friend recommended the restaurant to my husband for my birthday dinner on 3rd March 2013. We enjoyed the views as we walked to the restaurant from the car park. The welcome and service was good and the waiter serving us gave us good recommendations from the menu. The food was creatively presented, fresh and delicious. The portions were just nice and the price was reasonable.I was surprised by the mini birthday cake and the birthday song from the restaurant staff. I was also taken away by the magnificent views at the open rooftop bar but it was too windy to have our dessert or drinks there. After our dinner, we were greeted with a romantic light show at the bottom of the restaurant.We are going back again this weekend with our teenage daughters
4
Inspite of a cold and unfriendly welcome from the staff (changed once we were going to eat and drink...after a few hours they had become effusive ~) the view and food is worth the initial indifference.The decor is totally incompatible to the surrounds...disco balls and scaled place mats (with matching pillows) makes one concentrate of the vista outside the windows which is why you just paid $S10 for your 'free' drink....Interesting menu and not overly priced (as is the cafe in the Flower Dome).Ask to go to the roof top bar...the 360o view of the city is just spectacular, one can get an appreciation of what this city has achieved
5
Go early in the evening as the sun sets over the city. The views from the restaurant and roof top are incredible and the food is delicious. Some what pricey but well worth it for a one off treat or special occasion. A real novelty of a place to eat and you can get an excellent collection of photos
3
It is amongst the only resturants up there on the super tree at gardens by the bay . If you are going all the way there for a meal it is a walk from the taxi drop off. The location is beautiful , well worth the walk. Even though you feel you have stepped into Steven spielbergs vision of the future. The bare tree with the lights is pretty though not in the conventional sense.it does grow on you if you like the neon light culture.personally I thought the lights were too bright while we were sitting inside and would have preferred to just see the Singapore lights out in the distance.I have to mention the decor the huge Queen Anne chairs in purple velvet with fake Swarovski is what I distinctly remember. Lady gaga video meets sci fi? But you have to go onceThe drinks were Indochine price and quality and so was the service. But the food was the biggest dissapointment. Don't expect the Indochine quality or even menu. The menu was lacking and the food wasn't upto the Indochine mark either.We spent $700 for 3 and most of it was on the drinks , I distinctly remember wanting ice cream especially after the walk back to the taxi stand and the wait.Go for the view and the drinks
4
Went there for lunch and the food was delicious. The lemongrass chicken and taro dessert was really good. Our food was served quickly and the staff were attentive. I would definitely go back.
5
Very friendly staff, and great service. The price agrees with the very good kitchen. Lamb with sweet potato is superb!
Thumbs up for this one!
4
Went there several times and love their beef steak and fries! Great place for a hot date with great food, scenery and ambience. You can choose to dine outdoor and enjoy the sunset. :) Definitey will go back again to try other dishes.
4
Just before posting this review I skimmed the other reviews and see this place is below par on the ratings buy I thought it was great. We had crispy fish and kampong chicken... But really the experience here is having lunch up the top of a giant fake tree that looks like something from Star trek or lost in space. If you want to understand iy go and google super tree and you will get the picture. Siy using on a cowhide lounge with purple chairs just adds to the expxoerience

‘Gardens on the Bay’ is a wonderful eco-park, gardens and plant preservation project, in the middle of Singapore. There is a grove of is a grove of 18 ‘Super-trees’, vertical gardens up to 50 meters tall that capture rainwater, filter exhaust, and are capped with photo-voltaic panels which provide enough energy to light the trees at night: one of them also houses a restaurant.This restaurant provides a spectacular venue, perched in the top of a ‘tree’ overlooking the lights of the bay and Singapore harbour; it must be one of the world’s perfect places for an eatery. Unfortunately, it is also completely wasted. One wonders which bright spark decided that the Indochine chain of restaurants was a suitable management group, to manage a restaurant of this unique quality. It is an appalling excuse for a restaurant which offers horrible food, badly served by unpleasant, obnoxious, waiters who have no idea how to care for their guests and give not a jot for their clients comfort, satisfaction or welfare. The management is obvious only by its absence. I beg the management group at Gardens on the Bay, please get rid of Indochine and replace their dreadful restaurant with one which people will wish to visit more than once
4
The view is magnificent. Especially if you visit the rooftop bar. That day was especially windy, so it can be pretty tricky for a dainty wine glass. We had dinner at the outdoor area of the restaurant. We got an intern of a waiter who did not understand 'What is the housewine" question. Actually rather unacceptable for an Indochine standard. Equally unforgiveable are the amount of bones I found in the cod fillet & prawn dish. Now that place isn't that bright to dine to begin with, so finding bones was scary. I think the food at Waterfront is still better than this outlet. So if anything, just go for a drink and forget the food there. The rooftop bar is just fantastic. It is quite small, so it is quite 'cosy'. Yet you get the top of the world feeling
2
Went with a group end Dec. All had different things and no one was happy. Food was really bad and in some cases, inedible .For such a new restaurant you would expect much better. One male staff member was extremely rude and made us feel awkward. Our son even nicknamed him "mr tough".We did have to wait for drinks and meals not received all together but understand they may have been busy. Singapore have great restaurants but this is not one. Big room for improvement needed with food and get rid of the rude staff member
3
Visited the outlet last weekend for dinner my boyfriend. The place is quite nice. I'm not a fan of the decor but the view made up for it. Food-wise, it was above average. The service was well-meaning and attentive, but still has room for improvement. The place is still new so I'm sure it just get better
4
The restaurant in the top of this building which is shaped like a tree is very good. The food was delicious and presented well. But the best part of this restaurant is the location - in the Gardens by the Bay, with the different modernly shaped objects shaped like trees, with the views of the harbour as well as the impressive Marina Sands buildings in the background, make for a unique and good experience to eat there
2
My friends and I went for a big dinner. The decor is kinda crazy but it is fun. I must stress that my 2 stars are for the view and the staff. In between drinks we had a walk around outside admiring the view and the staff were really trying hard to be kind and helpful.We ordered tapas dishes which were fine but very small- 3 prawns for $20 and 3 scallops for $24 was a bit steep.But the main problem was the lemongrass kampong chicken. It features heavily in a big picture in the menu but what arrived was nothing like it. 4 of us ordered it and 4 of us agreed that it was inedible. Mine had runny bloody liquid coming from it and it was disgusting. I complained to the staff who told me that the chickens were cooked as "they were microwaved well". This dish was $36. It was terrible. I notice other reviews reflect this. Go for drinks and the view but avoid the food. Pity as Indochine are a good group
5
Went there for dinner and drinks with a group of friends. Nice, cosy place with a great view. Attentive staffs that really make you feel good. It is a place that i will definitely go back again.
4
We had tapas. The food was very delicious. We enjoyed the TomYam Lobster soup. Very tasty. We also enjoyed the scallop roll, and mashed potatoes. The chairs were nice, the decor a bit strange. Try the bar on top. The staff was very polite and attentive. Though the food was slow and they missed an item, the staff did apologize and quickly rectified it. Also make sure that you call a taxi before you leave or the wait can be long
4
Food was average and over priced but the setting is amazing. Was happy to pay for the experience. The staff were not very interested but we were there in the afternoon and not staying for a meal - was told they only serve green tea - really

Indochine was recommended to us by an expat of Singapore however they were not familiar with Supertree. After booking for New Years Eve by email and having contact with the restaurant 2 days prior and giving credit card details both by email and telephone, we assumed our booking was confirmed and looking forward to our special New Years Eve in this restaurant with a view.How wrong were we....It was a wet night so our Taxi dropped us off and we had to walk about 15 minutes the long way to keep under cover and then a brisk walk with no cover to the Supertree. Greeted by two female receptionists, who under the circumstances that was to follow, did their best. The reception area is so small and is the entrance to the "tree" with a very narrow walkway once past the reception desk to the lift,. We paid by credit card and checked the price just before we were shown to the lift and surprise surprise, the price was not as quoted. We had actually been quoted for the Xmas Special which resulted in a misunderstanding of prices but after about 40 minutes of discussions and trying to sort this problem out with the Manager, we came to a mutual compromise of the quoted rate without the alcohol included. At this point no adjustments were made to our credit card charge and we were happy to sort out later. We were taken up in the lift to the Dining Area. Expecting a lovely setting and furnishings, we were sadly surprised at the tacky interior but this was not the problem. We were left waiting near the lift doors for about 10 minutes for our table (we did have a booking). We were then greeted by the same male "thug" who other reviewers have mentioned. (Had we read the previous reviews we would not have even booked here. This person then said he had our table ready but couldnt seat us together/ ????We had booked for 4 people, and I would have assumed a booking for 4 meant at the same table but oh no, this staff member who was intent of being as unpleasant as possible, then claimed we did not have a booking. At this stage it was at least one hour since we first entered reception. Again we explained we had a booking and he then claimed we had not contacted them and paid a deposit, all with the threatening manner of a Pit Bull about to attack.(Apologies to Pit Bulls) By this stage we had had enough and said we would not accept separate tables and had confirmed booking for 4. Again this person with his threatening and unpleasant manner, accused us of not having a booking and by this stage we had had enough and requested our credit card be credited, we would go elsewher and we would be contacting Indochine management. He then made an attempt to start phoning somebody to see what he could do but we refused staying there any longer and insisted our credit charge be credited immediately which is was. Never ever have we encountered such an unprofessional and disgraceful representative of any business and for this person to be representing Indochine, it is the worst advertising for their business possible. This person thinks he is bigger than the Indochine enterprise itself and if this is the kind of staff member representing this Company, Indochine either need to dispense with his services immediately or they will loose so many customers and any good name their company still has. From the reviews on Supertree, we were lucky we didnt eat there. Instead we had the wonderful night we had at Clarke Quay with good food, fabulous friendly staff who value their jobs and their customers and enjoyed the New Years Eve celebrations. My advice is DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT . There are many many nicer restaurants with lovely friendly staff who offer good service, good value, and lovely food., Maybe Indochine will realise they have a problem at this restaurant and do something about it

Had a birthday lunch today and made reservations. Upon arrival, a bored looking receptionist in a very lazy polo shirt and pants kept talking to her walkie talkie to check on table availability. First impression on the decor is : just awful and tasteless. Why did they stake the entrance with plates and sink tops? I would think some plants would be great, given the location. Upon arriving at third floor, nobody was there to greet us to show us to our seats so we just walked to a table and sat down. The starter was pretty good, considering we were already very hungry when we got there. But our salad had a live worm in it. They were very apologetic and gave us another fresh salad (with only two salad leaves instead, and more of the other stuff, maybe to decrease the chances of us finding another worm?). Anyway the manager apologised countless times and did not charge us for the salad. The kampung chicken was reasonably good, but the prawns were nothing to shout about. The toilets needed cleaning. Looked dusty and felt like it was the staff's toilet. I think the decor bothered me more than anything. It just looked cheap, old, dusty and tasteless, and felt like it some some store house for them to keep their unwanted vases. I was trying very hard to find the wow factor. I hope Indochine can change this into a more natural decor setting and improve on the service and quality of staff (including appearance and uniform)

After living in Singapore for almost 6 years I can safely say this is the worst dining experience I have encountered for any level of restaurant, coffee shop or hawker. Infact it was so bad I decided to sign up to tripadvisor and share with other readers. Starting with being told our reservation had been lost when we arrived. The maitre d’ continued the line that we had no booking despite showing him the phone log from my mobile, detailing exactly when we had called. The attitude seemed to be one of ‘we don’t care you can just leave’. There was not even a hint of an apology. Grudgingly we were then offered an inside table suitable for only 2 people. After explaining this was unsuitable as we had booked for four, at an outside table, we were then shown upstairs to the bar to wait whilst a table became available. After 35 minutes in the bar we had still not even received the drinks that we had ordered, taking the top off a bottle of beer was obviously beyond the bar staffs capability. Eventually when we were shown to an available table it was a lounge type chair, where you required to have the arm reach of inspector gadget to actually reach the food on the table. The same maitre d’ asking us sarcastically if ‘this one is good enough for you?’. Another waiter then appeared to tell us the Asahi we had ordered 35 minutes previously were not available. How on earth can it take that long?The evening continued with mistaken orders and rare steaks arriving well done. After finishing the main course we noticed our waitress for the evening collecting her bag and leaving. It was then over an hour before anyone else came to ask us for any additional drinks order, also at no point were we even offered the dessert menu. All in all this Indochine was like Fawlty Towers without the laughs. The Assistant manageress kindly offered us a discount on the service charge but really that doesn’t cover just how pathetic a dining ‘experience’ we encountered.Unfortunately this is another example of a restaurant based solely on view which is becoming more commonplace within Singapore, this however is safely the worst of the lot I’ve come across thus far.For 550 dollars for 4 main courses, a few drinks and a starter sharing platter this was an expensive and wholly unsatisfactory night

Compared with the other IndoChine restaurants in Singapore, this new branch was a shocking experience for me and my family...and as a vegetarian! A poor veggie menu, very poor for a restaurant named "IndoChine" and offering 'vegetarian ricotta' not realizing that there was chicken sauce in it. The spot is beautifully high with a view on Singapore's skyline. The food tasted like it was defrosted in a microwave. There was no real sense of quality, speed of service and sequence of service. Waiters, mostly male, were slow and barely understanding special orders or specific drinks and cocktails mentioned in the menu. We guessed that they mainly used male waiters because they all have to run the stairs up and down as the kitchen is situated opposite the gents toilet one story below the restaurant floor. One should develop a sense for hygiene.Being a fan of IndoChine, we would recommend the management to seriously review the entire 'High Up' menu, kitchen management, personnel. The Philippina manager was the only one working very hard and efficient. Get more oriental stuff for vegetarians....it is "Indo and Chine", right? Interior design needs to be aligned with the other IndoChine restaurants in Singapore

I went to gardens by the bay and spotted this good looking restaurant there. Looking at its height, I decided to go there for lunch. At the enterance they charged us $10/head as covercharges for drinks (non alcoholic) and $18 for alcoholic. When we reached up there, what we were voffered in return of those cover charges vouchers was half cup of tea/coffee (for $10 per head) and a 200ml glass of Beer ($18). I think thats pretty expensive and is not worth. And on top of this, service was super slow.We just ordered fried rice and I was amazed at the quantity, one plate wont be sufficient even for a 2 years old. A total wastage of time and money :

I booked a table for 6 persons for dinner way in advance for a good friend's 50th birthday. I specify my requirements before hand and was told "no problem".On arrival, I was shocked to be given a table meant for 4 persons, with 2 small stools added as seats. Definitely not fit for a "fine dining" set up.I brought some fine wines and I was perfectly happy to pay the corkage of $40++ per bottle. But when I asked for decanter, they do not have any! I have to resort to using fruit juice jug!The service staff are obviously part-timers. Most of them have no clue of how to serve. One of the staff overflow my water glass when filling up, causing a flood over the table and floor.What a nightmare!! I will never go there again

Went there on 19 dec. Food 2/10: expensive not because of price but in terms of value for money. Decor is disgusting, fake flowers and bushes everywhere. Wonder who is that idiot that they employed to do the interior design??? $18 for the first drink???? You gotta be kidding me! This restaurant's location has all the potential but unfortunately Michael Mah (CEO of IndoChine) does not how to make full use of it. I wouldn't be surprised if this fad will be over soon, this restaurant will die a slow death if no changes to the food menu and decoration are done

My dinner there was a most DREADFUL AND HORRENDOUS experience. 8 of us decided to have a nice get together and we wanted to try a new place.The service was TERRIBLE. The manageress was very rough and spoke like someone looking for a fight. The staff didn't give way to us, the diners, but squeezed through the narrow space past us. The staff don't appear to be properly trained and had the standard you would expect in a neighbourhood coffee house or coffee shop. When our host asked the waiter for his recommendation for the starter, the waiter told him to look at the menu.My main course came before my starter. My Angus prime beef was tough like hawker standard. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium well. The oysters were lukewarm. They didn't give us forks for the oysters. I had to use my steak fork (after I had used it to eat my steak). I also had to use my steak knife to cut the oyster from the shell. My friend's papaya salad was limp and not fresh (though another friend's salad was okay).I was expecting a spectacular view judging from their website's description but all we saw were the restaurant lights reflecting back at us from the glass. Only the open-air rooftop had a good view.The ambience was like that of a karaoke lounge but at fine dining prices. We couldn't hear each other across the table. Two of us only had stools. The rest of our group had proper chairs. We asked for proper chairs but the manageress told us all the tables were reserved and there were no more chairs.The entrance to the men's restroom was disgraceful. It looked like the back entrance of a coffee shop in Chinatown. See attached photos.It was an absolute waste of time and money.On the way home, I ended up buying bean curd, soya milk and hum-chim pang to make up for the disappointing dinner. And I certainly enjoyed that much more.VERY SHAMEFUL for Gardens by the Bay. I was going to bring my overseas guest there in February but now I won't touch the place with a ten-foot pole

Went there for a drink with some friends at the bar on a weekend. Great view and nice bar. I think the entry fee is reasonable, considering a lot of bars charge a cover/ first drink charge. The staff were attentive and friendly, we didn't have to wait very long for a seat or to take our orders.Generally a good experience, we didn't encounter any major problems here. Nice chillout place especially on the outdoors 'terrace' area

My wife and I decided on a romantic dinner just fo 2.... Bad Oysters (somewhat warm and certainly not chilled) as well as bad grilled scallops (very fishy tasting). The steak was gamey and veiny (an angus Ribeye it wasnt). long waits for drinks, mistakes in the order.... the staff tried to do the best as possible and I give them credit for that. My wife is now sick and vomiting, and I beleive I have eaten the worst meal I have ever had in Singapore during my last 11 years. Its a great view, especially at night. But for food.... try anywhere else. If you want IndoChine, Fobidden City is good and Boat Quay at the Museum is excellent. Skip this one until they work out all the wrinkles

What a shame that this place is staffed and managed so badly. The poorly trained lady demanding $18 per drink at the entrance to the bar should be a warning of what is to come next. Awful service (if you can call being ignored for 15 minutes service), over priced drinks and tacky decor all serve to make this a place to avoid. The view is good and the Alexander the Great statue in the toilet (not sure what relevance he has to Indochina) makes you chuckle but please save your money and avoi

Went on weekend to check out the place, paid cover charge at entrance and enjoy th view on top. Restaurant just open and still in the mess but the staffs are trying hard to accomodate the guests needs and other tasks well. Music too loud and noisy. Most of the staffs looked tired but still greet the guests & smile.The young malay lady very courteous and show us around. We went to roof top and greeted by the Indian manager who was very professional with good customer service and always visible. Pricing a bit expensive but worth paying for this kind of place.They need time to improve and definately will be most famous restaurant in town

Hostess at the entrance who's obviously ill experienced insisted each of us have to pay $10 for a non-alcoholic drink or $18 for a beer or wine and we had to decide there and then. When we had paid the 'entrance fee' and were allowed in, we wanted to order champagne , mixes and other drinks... We were willing to pay the difference as my friends did not exactly want the beers offered, and neither did we fancy the house wines. The manager then came to us and arrogantly informed us that these would be considered new orders and we would have to pay the full price and, in essence forfeit what we had paid at the gate. He got impatient when we said we didn't want a Tiger or Heineken , neither did we want the house red or white. They not only missed the opportunity for a higher check but managed to really annoy us .... We were also checking the place out for possible future corporate eventsWith so many other venues in Singapore we'll just give this place a miss

Like most places that rely on location speciality, this place is a shocker. Bad & slow service, super expensive but average cocktails an interior that was sourced by your mad, deranged aunty on drugs, a lift that doesn't work, this place is wrong from start to finish. Try @ your own perri

Highly unrecommended! Definitely one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. We went on a Tuesday and it was definitely not crowded nor busy. Utter confusion starts at the ground level reception, even before you take the lift up to the restaurant. I can't possibly imagine what it's like on a weekend when it's fully booked. Premium prices for food that tasted like it came out of a bad food court. Totally disorganised service. Clueless staff. Food took 2 hours to arrive (not kidding!). Drinks arrived at our table long after the ice had melted. The list goes on. I don't blame the staff as they were polite and attentive, but I do have expectations of Indochine. They were definitely below expectation here. It was not a fine dining experience.After dinner, we decided to adorn to the roof top open air bar. Ordered a bottle of White wine. It took about 20 mins for it to arrive. The wine came with wine glasses, all of which were dripping with water like they just came out of a tub of water. One was visibly stained with lipstick. I think they rinsed the glasses and not washed/cleaned them.The manager apologized for the bad experience we had and he was polite and apologetic and even gave us a discount. But that just did not make up for the terrible food and service standards.The view from the restaurant/bar was fantastic though. I'd go there just to take a look around.Such a shame, considering the lovely venue

The area around the Supertrees was great. There was a host to greet us and check for reservations which was a good start. Then we went into a semi circle corridor full of decor supplies...felt like a service elevator. Greeted inside the restaurant but our tablw was not ready. We walked on the pathway just outside the restaurant whivh circled the whole place. Too many messy tables outside. Overall the food was average, the decor felt like a Thai disco and the bill was too high. This restaurant won't last
