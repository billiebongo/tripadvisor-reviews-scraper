Itâ€™s a nice place to buy some juicy chicken and beef and pork ribs. Good thing is they provide nice salad and other sides too for a balanced meal.

Good for eat-in & take-away. Halal Western food in coffee shop setting that specialises in roast chicken (spicy and non spicy versions available). Good selection of other meats too eg lamb & beef.

Great food at very reasonable prices. The steak is yummy and tender. Ask for medium rare and the sides are good too. Then there also is the Malay food which is absolutely brilliant. The have an extensive range of home cooked food for your picking.

Charco's Flaming Chicken originated from Perth, Australia, and this is very good halal food. It is located inside a typical kopitiam in a HDB estate...so one wouldn't expect to get lamb ribs and kebab here. Not only do you get it, there is also a salad bar to choose from and the Caesar's salad is pretty good (go during lunch - salads are fresher). Price-wise you could consider it reasonable for the quality and amount you get. Bear in mind there is no air-conditioning nor alcohol to accompany your meal as it is in a halal place, run by Mr Teh Tarik

Basically it's fasting month, so colleagues and I decided to have our breakfast at CHARCOS. This setting is a simple coffee shop, lined up with simple seats and tables. I've heard many good things about the place so I really couldn't wait to dig into the food! I had the ribs with 3 sides (seafood salad, tandoori pasta & egg salad)The wait time was not long albeit the place being busy. The ribs are decently tender, great chew and hints of smoky taste left me wanting more. The sides were a great companion to the meat! Each one was different and tasted individually good. All in all I was impressed by a simple grill at a coffee shop, they kept the setting plain but the food good

Charco's is located in a neighbourhood coffeeshop in Ang Mo Kio. It is not terribly accessible by public transport (I had to take the MRT and a bus) but it was well worth the trip. I ordered Lamb Ribs with potato wedges and chicken avocado salad. Payment by NETS is available and the food came promptly. Do note that although the coffeeshop is 24 hours, Charco's itself closes at 10pm, so do take note of the opening hours

We ordered the Beef Ribs with Fries and different portions of Charco's Chicken with potato wedges , creamed potatoes and peas. It was in under the void- dec, hawker setting with outdoor seating and since we went late afternoon abt 5pm It was not warm. The food was pretty quick to arrive and it was warm as well. The ribs were awesome looking and tasty but the sauce was pretty plain. The meat on the ribs were tender. The chicken was warm. I must say, I LOVE the creamed potatoes. As the name suggests, the sauce is creamy with cheese and it was smooth. Nothing matches best with the thick slices of potatoes. The chicken was tender but not juicy. The skin was nice and crisp. Some herbal stuffing was inside the chicken. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick fix of roasted chicken and ribs
