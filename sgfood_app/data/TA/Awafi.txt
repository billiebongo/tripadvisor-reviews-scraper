Once you get into the building the service is great the food is wonderful. we came on Friday and they only serve lunch to go because of Shabbat. The workers are smiling and willing to help. The food was good.

We had dinner on 3 different evenings and also spent the Shabbat with this wonderful community. Restaurant is clean, efficient and tasty. They also arrange for deliveries to nearby hotels if needed, although we didn't make use of this service. Please note that advance reservation is strongly recommended and don't forget to bring along your passport in order to be allowed inside the building

Awafi serves up some amazing falafel and hummus along with Israeli salad. My wife and I have eaten at Awafi numerous times and it is consistently good. I would also recommend the Mezze platter so you can try several items. For your first visit, you will need to bring your passport / ID f to register at the gate of they synagogue. This is for security purposes. You can visit the kosher store as well

I was with some-one who keeps Kosher, so choice was limited. In fact, Awafi is the only Kosher restaurant in Singapore, so there was really no choice at all.Food - good selection, OK quality, but serve portions could be larger. (I had a schnitzel.) Surroundings and décor - OK. Staff - very helpful and fully understanding of the needs and requirements of the clientele

This is the only Kosher Restaurant in Singapore and is hidden away on the 6th floor of the Jacob Ballas Centre on Waterloo Street. Security is tight so be prepared to bring your passport on your first trip.Although a small restaurant it is tastefully furnished. The manager is a delightful 5th generation Singaporean and they have two Nepalese chefs. The menu is a mixture of western and oriental meals (except on certain nights when there is a cut down menu - this is on a Thursday evening, Sunday lunch and when they have a function in the centre). The cut down menu still has chicken schnitzel and chips (which absolutely delicious), fish and chips, grilled chicken etc. The portions are not huge but the food was of a very good quality and taste and more to the point it is very reasonably priced - around £10 for a main course of meat/fish and two veg. The manager (Paul) is a delightful guy and immediately makes you feel welcome. We also booked for Friday evening and Saturday lunch. The Friday evening meal is variable (we went twice) the second time being absolutely delicious. Friday is well organised - please book in advance. Saturday lunch is very crowded. A gem of a restaurant which is recommended

The only thing i can say about the food is that ita kosher.I took the mi goreng dish. It was softly spicy and tasty even though it was too small for me after a busy day. Try the sizeling chicken which was also good.No atmosphere at all, no windows etc... Come here only to eat good kosher food

Hidden away at 24 Waterloo Street on the 6th Floor of a beautiful contemporary building next door to the oldest synagogue in Southeast Asia is a marvelous kosher restaurant in the Jewish Community Center. You must present a passport to be admitted by security at the gate (a sign of the times we live in) and reservations are recommended, but being new to Singapore, we just walked in and were warmly greeted by staff and guests alike. A lovely, small, comfortable place with a nice variety of wonderful food, Awafi is an oasis in Singapore, a city of 8,400 restaurants. It is located in one of the nicest parts of the city close to the Singapore Art Museum and the National Museum of Singapore. We had a great meal served graciously by Manager Anthony and his wonderful staff. The food is fresh and delicious with many tempting middle eastern, Chinese and local options and all prepared perfectly ... and we cannot wait to have another meal there soon. It is a family-friendly place with kids seeming to love it as much as adults. It was a very special experience for us.
