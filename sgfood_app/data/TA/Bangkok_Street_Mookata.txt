We went to the one in Bedok North Avenue 4. Not sure if they have their own review site but since this is a franchise / branch, I suppose it's ok to post my review here.I have tried many different types of cooking the food myself at the table. This concept of bbq with the broth being flavoured by the meat juices is good.Found some of the chicken didn't looked fresh but they seemed ok & none of us had any ill effects.Overall, the experience was ok. My only gripe is that i had the unfortunate seat where the smoke & steam was blowing onto me. Had to have a cigarette just to get away with it! (Yeah right!)Maybe someone could come up with some invention / idea to vent the smoke & steam upwards

This is the best mookata I've eaten in Singapore! Price is affordable, food is good, service is prompt!I love their chicken and pork belly, so good that it can be eaten without dipping in the sauce! There are 2 types of chili sauce and both are shiok! On a few occasions, they missed out some of my orders. However they immediately serve the missed out orders to my table upon my request - no further questions asked

You can't go wrong here as you are doing the cooking so there's only yourself to blame. Each table has a BBQ electric stove which cooks your meat and has a moat around it which hold the soup mix, the juices from the meats run into the soup for added flavour.Wide selection of meats, seafood and veg on offer, you can go for the set buffets or a la carte selection.Staff are there to help you out if your a newbie. Thoroughly enjoyable

Went with my brother for dinner at Bangkok Street Mookata @Toa Payoh Lorong 8 area. Plenty of people were already eating mookata. Didn't really waited for long for our order to reach us. Portion was good and the marinated pork belly was really good. (We ordered 10 portion of it). Overall was a great meal. Only paid SGD 37 for 2 pax. Will definitely go there again

We have been several times to this restaurant because it was close by out hotel. We really enjoyed the taste of the meat and vegetables. We choose a la carte instead of the set plate. Not a really big menu, but just enough. Also a very decent price and friendly staff.

We noticed a new restaurant Bangkok Street Mookata that opened end Nov 2014 and it is rather crowded most of the times. Hence, we decided to give it a try!The place isn't that accessible and it's recommended to drive a car to park at a outdoor carpark there. Not to worry, there's always plenty of carpark spaces there.Platter for 4 @ $39, Platter for 2 @ $22 - We skipped the platter as we had wanted more meats and not dishes like the corn, hotdogs, fishballs etc.Before grilling our food, we got the Pork Lard from one of the waiters. We were given 2 pieces only and had to keep asking for the pork lard as the quantities given are like a couple of pieces at a time. Anyways, as we brushed the surface of the dome-shaped wok, we noticed that there were black pieces of scraped off stuff on the pork lard. Food Quality: The marinated meats, mainly the garlic pork collars, pork bellies, beef, chicken tasted good. We reckoned that they were thawed meats but we can't taste any staleness/soggyness as the marination was done well. :) The scallops, golden mushrooms, Shishamo are good choices too for this thai grilling style.Food Quantity: For the meats, the price starts at $1.90 a plate and the serving was a few pieces of meat which was small. But what more can we ask for at $1.90, $2.90 a plate? We added on to the orders to quite a number of plates otherwise there weren't enough to go around.For the full review and pictures, you may refer to: http://adriennehoxy.com/bangkok-street-mookata-jurong-west
