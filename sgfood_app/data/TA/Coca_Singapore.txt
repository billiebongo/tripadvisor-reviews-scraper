Overall a good experience. Price is consider worthy. But choice of food variety is not alot. Would be great if there is more variety of food.
4
Delicious food! My children loving so much!
Had been there many times for dinner.
Will go back again!
5
Good food, sliced beef and pork are good.
We had the buffet and also the promotional drinks was 1 for 1.
The table was set up already so it was easy to get the hot pot boiling.
5
Good service and the food is superb! The staff initiated to help us cook the food. Also, their service is so fast that when I turned, wanting to throw unwanted food onto empty plates, they already cleared them. Will definitely visit again!
5
Quality of the food at Coca is always good and fresh. The tom yum soup base and clear chicken broth are great. Staff is attentive and responsive to customers. Overall a good environment for a cosy dinner with friends and family.
4
Great ambience and variety of dishes. I had an enjoyable meal with my family.
Service can be improved on.
4
The steamboat set also comes with a great selection of choices. The quality of the ingredients at Coca is also fresh. It would be better if the restaurant offers a range of difference sauces.
4
Good food, ambience and value for money. food is fresh and like the house special dumpling best of all.
4
The soup and food are nice. Children love to drink the soup.
However, the buffet price for children is very steep.

We booked for lunch and they have 2 seatings. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was practically empty but they did not allow us to seat at the table unless 2/3 of the booked guests have arrived. I totally do not get this concept as we are just short of 1 pax of this requirement and yet we are expected to wait outside and not let in. The Management should look into improving this situation and be more flexible. Further to this, service was bad, the waiters did not bother to take our orders for drinks and keep forgetting parts of our orders. Mind you, the restaurant was rather empty at that time. Price wise, is not cheap, and if service was up to standards, price is definitely not an issue. I always enjoyed Coca before, but i think that their service had dipped below acceptable level. I probably will not be coming back though i still do enjoy Coca's memorable chili dip
5
Been here several times, and it’s been pretty consistent. Good food, decent ambience and great service! Price point may be a bit steep but worth it!
4
The place is cosy n the service staff is friendly. Too bad they have a time limit for each buffet booking
4
Food is good but service can be improved especially in ensuring they serve the correct food. We always have problem with what is served, what you ordered might not be served, what you didn’t order might be.
5
A must try steamboat at Orchard.
Fresh seafood and friendly service!
Free flow mini lobster, fish maw, scallop, oyster, prawn etc
The chicken soup is so tasty.
3
Good variety. Service attentive and pleasant. Maybe Coca should ensure fish has more variety and is fresh. Currently only 1 type of gush is available and not very fresh.
5
Coca i the best Steamboat Restaurant ever
their Seafood, Vegetables.. was fresh
and service was extremely GOOD
4
Fresh and yummy steam boat. Great for a rainy cool day with friends !
The meat especially is very fresh.
Portions are great and the soup base is tasty.
2
I have been patronising Coca since when they had a branch at The Concourse. The key reasons why it was my regular steamboat place were the freshness of the raw food, especially the slice fish and prawns and the tastiness of the signature chili sauce. During my most recent visit to the branch at Ngee Ann City, the prawn shells stuck to the flesh after it were cooked and the fish was almost rubbery. Clear signs that both were not fresh. The chili was the greatest disappointment. It lacked flavor and punch. Will I visit again? Probably not
3
I was more thirsty than hungry at 3pm on a really hot afternoon. I had to wait a long time before they came to take order. I ordered the roast duck with noodles and a lemon ice tea. They gave me a gift by doubling my ice tea order which was so welcome. The restaurant was not half full so the waiters could not have been overstressed. When they finally brought the duck it was delicious. The kale and noodles were equally delicious. That was the last that I saw the waiters. I paid the cashier, who gave me a toothpick and I left. The food was fine but the service sucked
4
My extended family were here for a birthday celebration with about 13 pax, and we were glad there was a private room/space for such a big group. Our family had the lunch buffet and we were quite satisfied with the service provided. The waitress recommended that we order a standard set of items for the first round, so that we could have a taste of everything. Subsequently, all the items we ordered during the second and third rounds were served promptly too. It can be a little difficult to get them to refill the soup during peak periods, but do go ahead and ask, and the staff will come around with the refills. As we had a birthday cake with us, the restaurant kindly provided us with the plates and also helped to bring the cake to our table. It was a wonderful gesture from Coca! Although this was my first visit, it may not be the last - hopefully to return again
4
Food was good. Restaurant service could have been better as they were pretty slow in topping up the soup base (pot was almost dry).
5
This is an ideal location for family meals. The staff are courteous and responded to our requests efficiently.
5
Service was excellent, food was awesome and the place isn't packed or noisy. You might want to advanced book this place. Usually booking is full before noon.
4
Coca provided an extensive range of steamboat items to choose from, that were fresh & delicious.
There appeared to be insufficient staff . However, when their attention could be obtained, the staff provided good service.
3
Used to love this- everything like the twin hot pot Tom yum and chicken soup, best chili sauce, fish glue are lovely- this has a premium set now with lobsters fish maw scallops drinks sea cucumber buffet.
5
The waitress whom had attended to us provided excellent service. She has been carrying out duties with a smile all the time and did not seem to be irrirated by our repeated request for extra chilli, order, etc. When we commented that the soup base( we had tom yum) was full of the chilli seeds, she immediately made a change for us and apologied profusionly. Though the buffet was not very cheap but her service made it up.
4
The restaurant was busy on Saturday lunch time. Wait staff was rather preoccupied with diners and serving. Needed to wait for some time to get their attention.Other than that the ambience was clean and good for a steamboat meal.Selection was great if not fantastic, but definitely good quality unlike the mass steamboat in the market. The prawns especially very fresh and good size for steamboat. If you love cockles, you must order. Loving the size of the cockles and freshness with its blood.The selection of greens are more than enough if you are veggie lovers.Do not forget to order their special dumpling and house meat ball. They were really yummy. The usual dipping sauce is always special in COCA.If you do not make reservation, be prepared to share round table with other diners
1
Last Sunday, we went to the Coca Restaurant at Ngee Ann City for dinner & the waiter recommended the Premium Seafood steamboat buffet. It was really disappointing. The mini lobsters were not fresh & the fish maw had a rancid oil aftertaste. The super thinly sliced beef & the beef fillet were not fresh and had a strong beefy smell. They should use better quality ingredients if they are charging $60++ for it. I would not recommend this buffet at all. I wouldn't mind paying more if the quality of the mini lobster and the beef is good. The worst thing about dining out is when a reputable restaurant charges a 'premium' price for inferior quality ingredients
4
the best thing about coca steamboat is that the restaurant selection of dishes is minimal but unique and different from the other types of steamboat with common dishes available. Here at Coca, they serve their own made fish glue, shrimp balls, etc. Generally, dining at this restaurant is much more hygienic as they bring to you your selected items to your table instead of everyone holding the same tong or scoop to take the food. Even though the choice of food is limited compared to others, i feel that the variety available is just nice. Food.ia fresh too. Also the most special thing about Coca Steamboat is the sauce available. Yummy! I would like to dine at Coca again! Price is also reasonable
3
I made my reservation through chope and the waitress informed me that the system showed my reservation only but there was no my table reserved for me. She wanted me to call in to confirm on my reservation next time as reservation through chope will not be known as confirmed.also she asked whether i received any email on confirmation which i did.Luckily I went 15mins earlier otherwise I have no table.Furthermore, we had placed our orders but some of our items did not arrived and we need to reorder again. Lastly, we saw other table been served as the waiter or waitress will assists other customers to put ingredients into the hot pot but we have to self serve.kind of disappointed
5
The ordinary buffet was okay for the seafood...meat was not great...and most of the things are not available for ordinary buffet...should try the premium if you have a choice to choose...
5
Food was served fast and waitresses are very helpful.
The food is very delicious too.
However, the environment can be more spacious for more comfort.
3
Overall an average experience. Value of money but can have a wider selection. Service personnel is not attentive enough, can act more promptly and notice of each table needs
4
Overall, food is fresh and good. Unfortunately there is a time limit of 90 mins which we weren't told during booking and arrival. Nonetheless, will be back again.
4
The fish soup (topped another $20) was very good. However the shrimp dumplings and wonton skin is too thick. Service was ok. Felt a little under-staffed. Overall good experience.
5
I have been coming to this coca steamboat restaurant for the past 2 years and the food quality is still awesome! However, I am abit disappointed with available of dishes. I ordered for "Tang O" (a type of vegetable to be served during steamboat) but no on informed me that is not available till I asked. However, this doesn't stopped me from going again :D overall is a great restaurant and definitely recommended
3
Visited Coca at Taka after a long time. Their food items are fresher than the past, lesser choices thou. Their seafood items were very fresh when I visited the restaurant on 2 September. My sis and I are extremely disappointed with the chilli and tom yum soup. Chilli was too diluted and tom yum soup is too mild, almost can't taste any tom yum. Coca used to be my favourite steamboat place for the tom yum soup and chilli. Now I don't think I will re-visit anytime soon again
1
We had a reservation at 130 pm but arrived at 1.10 pm for lunch. As we were early, we stood by the counter at the entrance and waited for the waiter who was on phone. We waited patiently for him to get off the phone and was not greeted but rather "name" with a stern face ? How rude can one be? He said our table was not ready unless we want to share table and we said no we will be back later. When we got back, he asked the elder waiter to show us to our table. To our surprise it's a shared table. The rest of the waiters and waitress were all polite and pleasant except for this waiter who is perhaps stationed at the front counter most of the time asking patrons if they had made any reservations. Do we as patrons deserve such rudeness? The management should definitely look into this as it goes your establishment a really bad impression just becoause of one person
3
Disappointed to be ask to share table even with reservation as we r 10 min earlier for our 8pm reservation. When we rejected e guy staff tat show us e big Long table but need to share with other, he responded tat is different pots u know. Of course we notice tat e pots setup was different not sharing with e other customers. Who will Wan to share a streamboat pots with strangers and paying at tat price. Totally ridiculous! If i Wan to share table I may as well go golden mile. I make reservation and being ask to share table even there r at least 2 empty table tat we can see tat can accommodate e 6 of us. So told by him to wait for table for 6, slightly pass 8pm he told us e table was ready and table given was for 8 pax which is 1 of e empty table we saw. Which mean e empty table tat we saw is not reserved, juz tat he dun Wan to give us and Wan us to share.Luckily after e bad start, everything went well for e birthday celebration. e ladies staffs service was much better. but e start have spoil e mood.
4
Menu and food served was in line with what was presented online and staff were attentive - offering to top up the soup base and sauces when these were running low and offering to serve the fish glue without us having to ask for help!Restaurant was full and great that the staff were not overwhelmed, it was a Sat night
5
Food quality was superb and service staff was helpful and quite efficient. Had a great steamboat experience!
4
Like the wide range of food. The fish glue and soul is very nice and tasty. Service is good with attentive staff.
4
Review by Dr Sim. Food is generally good. Service is average. Part of a chain of restaurants from Thailand. Soup is good. Chilli sauce is good. Pricing is a bit high for steamboat. Ok for tourist to try. Regards Dr Sim
3
Food quality was expected from coca. Raw food was presented cold on clean plates and were wrapped in cling flim. Service could be improved. We had to direct the wait staff for service.
4
Fresh Ingredients, service was good. Reservations encouraged as have been rejected twice for walk in.
5
Food was very fresh and served very promptly. Attitude of staff were acceptable. Will definitely go back
4
First time eating hot pot in Singapore. We love the all you can eat hot pot! Lunch $27 for adult and $20 for children. The family had a great time! We recommend you try it if you're in Singapore!
5
The quality of the food never fail to satisfy our family. Love the "fish glue", the fish/pork balls, and especially the beef slices ... Wow ... So tender and fresh ... Coupled with the special sauce ... Guaranteed to leave with a full and satisfied stomach ...Enjoyed the service here (Takashimaya).
4
Location is convenient as it's in the central area where all shopping is. There are many variety choices of food for the steamboat. Price for lunch is still consider acceptable. It will be good if they can have promotion with the drinks or maybe free flow of drinks at a price.
4
Good services from one of the waitress serving my table and a friendly indian waiter.The place needs a better ventilation, still prefer the previous location at takashimaya (I went to the Coca at taka but it has moved to a new unit).We ordered the premier buffet set for the baby lobsters, scallops and fish maws but the baby lobsters were not fresh, as the flesh of the lobsters were very soft instead of having the crunchy freshness bite (not too sure how to describe it but it is just the not crunchy type. It's like "nua nua" in Hokkien).Else, the rest are good and I do enjoy my meal there especially it was the 1st time we brought our god-daughter for lunch
4
Nice ambiance, helpful and prompt service, fresh food, superb chili sauce, delicious soup base, but abit pricey
4
Always great to be back at COCA to ease my steamboat cravings. Their tom yum soup and of course their famous chili are reasons to ditch my diet plans!
5
always our first choice when it comes to steamboat! awesome experience again at coca. service was great as usual. food were fresh and the yuan-yang soup was yums!
4
Booked this restaurant as our original choice was unavailable. Typical steamboat restaurant where u order and they serve. Food was alright and service was normal as there were minimum interaction with the service staff. Recommend if you are there to takw the buffet instead.
4
The food and service environment is good. Make sure you have a reservation before you go. It is often full and walk in will not be entertained if so.
4
Loved the Tom yum soup. As good as when I was younger. About 50 per pax for dinner, but food was fresh and of good quality. We felt thirsty the next day though.
4
Enjoyed buffet steamboat with my friends at Coca. Love the freshness of the ingredients. Is good to go for their buffet if you are able to eat more as it is not cheap to order ala carte.
4
I've been coming here since I was a kid and the place remains consistently good! Opt for the buffet spread if you're with family and everyone can eat to their heart's content :)
4
A steamboat restaurant with good quality & a wide variety of food. Good service from the staff.
Top choice for luxury steamboat.
5
Me and my friend visited the restaurant on 7th may 2017 to try their chilli crab. Both of us were aware that it is expensive dish in Singapore. So before taking up a seat we enquired about the cost and were explained nicely by the staff. The cost seemed reasonable and we ordered 1 medium crab with all its paraphernalia. The crab we received was of about 700gms and looked real yummy.The taste was sweet and spicy and was very fulfilling. We also had a couple of beers with our food.The staff served us well and were very cordial. The restaurant was ultra clean and nicely decorated.Full marks for the chef and the restauran
4
Vast difference in price between dinner and lunch. It will be more reasonable if price for dinner is below $40
4
Coca at Ngee Ann city has always been my family's go to resturant when we have a craving for steamboat. Service is efficient and food is always fresh and quick to arrive.
5
Service was very warm and attentive. Drinks and soup were refilled without being asked to. Quality of food was good especially their meat.
3
Average restaurant with helpful staff. Food is mixed in quality - chicken rice was not as good as it used to be but if you order the right dishes, Coca is value for money
3
The tom yum soup definitely is a must. The variety of the buffet was limited and not much to choose from. The service staffs are not very attentive to all and tend to have a attitude towards different customers. Overall is an average experience.
5
Friends gathering and having premium buffet lunch. There're free flow of drinks, mini lobster, scallop and sea cucumber. Each ppl costs $50 after plus plus. It's valuable and tasty, will come back again.
4
Clean, quiet ambiance. Food served is fresh and good! Service is good too. Only thing to improve are the desserts. Will recommend and gladly go back again.
4
Good buffet lunch at the Taka brunch. Tom Yum soup was a little not up to par though.
Love the hand-made balls & fish glue!
5
Not our first time at Coca. Still love the food and service - staff will help to put the food into the hotpot, which is especially useful for the balls and fish glue. This time, we had a voucher with us that we forgot to use until we had paid, but the staff kindly void our initial payment so that we could use the voucher
3
The soup base here is nice with Thai tom-yum base, but not too spicy. If you cannot take spicy their clear soup base is also good.Most people chose the all-you-can-eat buffet, wild range of food you can order, the meat is particularly fresh. Recommend and will come again.
4
Senior citizen enjoy special concession price for the steamboat buffet. My Mother & aunts enjoy very much. Can have 2 kinds of soup - spicy & non spicy. We prefer the non spicy best.
4
This is our first time trying the tom yam based soup but the taste was so-so. Still prefer the original soup better. The quality of the food still maintained and will likely to go back again.
5
Established Thai steamboat with great service and food. Wide variety of selection, and in a central location. Will be back.
4
As per title. Good steamboat. Comfortable environment. Slightly on the more expensive side. But ok for food given.
3
certain food that we ordered was not serve. Quality ok only. No one walk around to refill soup. Hai di lao is a much better choice!
4
We came back to Coca again as we really enjoyed our first visit. Again it didn't disappoint and we really enjoyed ourselves. Would highly recommend. The only downside is only two choices of soup.
3
The soup base are good. The prawns and meat are fresh too. The only disappointment is the limited choice for the buffet lunch.
5
Coca never disappoints - definitely one of my favourite places to go to for a steamboat buffet. Quality food for a reasonable price - great soup bases and chilli :)
4
Food was fresh, service was excellent, however the price was steep. 6 person bill was 300+ dollars. Overall experience was ok.
2
Went for an early CNY lunch with my family and was disappointed with the service. Server 'Oscar' was quite rude with us but was extremely polite to the vietnamese family seated next to us. With 90minutes to eat, time was wasted with ingredients slowly placed in the pot individually and at first we weren't allowed to take the lid off ourselves but we couldn't wait for him to do it for us. The 'lobster' was extremely mushy and it was promised that the seafood was going to be fresh reasons we ordered from the special menu. Only thing enjoyed was the fish paste and vegetables but then again every steamboat place has that so nothing to be wowed about.
5
Good food with good service.
After my post in Facebook, one of my fren go to e restaurant next day too. And few of my frens were asking too, sure more frens will be going there.
3
Simple dishes but seafood like fish slices and prawns are fresh. We find the cockles too small. Maybe management should look into giving bigger more appetising ones.
4
Simple and fresh ingredient.
Chicken rice is nice. Good sauce with nice tom yum base for the steamboat
3
On courtesy, warmth, attentiveness and reception. Certain staff were attentive and serve as and when but most just execute service as routine and "robotic".
4
Quality of food is food and fresh. Replenishment of the food is fast though getting the attention of staff takes a while. It's New Year's Eve so it's understandable.
4
Staff were all friendly & helpful. The person in charged (Recep area was very friendly & helpful). Very enjoyable!
1
Food and soup OK. But was very very thirsty after the meal..... Didn't refill soup and chilli, and was asked to return the table by a time when I reserve via Chope. Service and food not as good as before at their International Building outlet.
4
The food is fresh, the seafood is very fresh. The chilli is good. Please have more of that chili. The soup is thick and fragrant.You know where your slightly more than higher price than average money went to. and you will know it is worth that premium
5
Very good buffet. The chilli sauce is amazing, food is fresh n great variety. Love it. Better to go on weekday so it is not as crowded. I prefer the other side which it was previously situated as it is more spacious. Now is very cram
3
I think the food and service standard had deteriorated a lot over the years . Been there a few times but this time round, quite disappointing!The food was not exceptionally nice ...As it was located in Orchard area, so that kind of price ($27++ per pax for lunch) , perhaps paying for the so-called restaurant atmosphere , so considered steep with such limited varieties though steamboat buffetNot highly recommended!
4
Love the great steamboat chilli sauce! Food quality was good as usual. Remember to book early especially for weekends.
4
Food was good and fresh. Soup base was nice with both the non-spicy and tom yum flavors. Service stuff was prompt and helpful.
4
For the price there's no complaints about the food. Service staffs are always ready to serve. It's worth giving it a try.
4
I've been to Coca for years. Many times. Best thing is that it is dependable. No unpleasant surprises. But no good surprises either. The steamboat buffet is certainly a good value. One thing I don't like is that they charge for plain water!
4
The waiter and waitress are good and prompt. They always make sure the orders are in order and any requests are always accomodative.
4
Food was good and staff was helpful. But crowded during the weekends and it is necessary to make reservation in advance to avoid long wait for walk-ins.
4
Location was great, food was alright. Limited variety of food, service was superb. Price was very affordable for a steamboat buffet!
4
The steam boat is tasty with their soup base. The special sauce is their forthe. Very addictive . The overall experience is good and their value is well received
4
Too much enough.
Any kind of soup and noodle were delicious.
We need order more delicious desserts next time.
4
Loved the signature steamboat chili sauce. Great buffet spread also although we thought that the lunch buffet was more value for money compared to the dinner buffet.
4
No waiting time needed as pre-booked via chope. The service staff was friendly. Food and environment was good. The selection of food could be improved.
5
Service staffs were awesome and professional. Food were definitely good! the Fish Glue is the Bombz! even the ice water tasted great hahahaha
4
I have made a reservation to celebrate my colleague birthday on a weekday lunchtime. Their food and service standard is good at Takashimaya.
4
Came here mainly for the great steamboat chili sauce! We ordered a la carte as we did not want to eat too much. But for big eaters, buffet is the way to go.
4
Service and food is good. A value-for-money buffet lunch. Love their soup base and chilli sauce. We were limited only to about 2 hours although the restaurant is not full.
5
I have to say I always look forward to this steamboat. Always satisfying, always good. And during lunch it's affordable! A must go for those who like good chili with good quality food. It's never like those
2
Booked my reservation on a Friday night at 7pm with my husband and my 6 years old son. We arrived on time, Half way through the dinner about 30mins, we were being informed that we are only allow to dine till 8pm which is only 1 hour for "BUFFET DINNER". Meaning we are left with 30mins to eat. Why are we only allow to dine for 1 hour if this is a buffet plus this is not stated in your website and reservation link or at the point when we are being usher to our table. THIS IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! Based on my past experiences, the restaurant used to served nice yummy soup, but this time round is a failure. It tasted so salty and feel like you are just drinking MSG directly from the soup. It makes us so thirsty after dinner. During serving, we asked the waiter what's the charges for kids, he told us that kids under 6 years old is free. But when making payment, the cashier billed us for our boy and told us kids above 6 has to pay. What kind of lousy service and information the restaurant is providing!!!!!! They seriously have to improve on every ways they are managing the restaurant. Disappointed!!!
5
Although it's a bit pricey for steamboat, but you are paying for their service and ambience. Always our top choice when my friends and I want to eat steamboat comfortably. Their famous chili sauce is to die for, even though I don't really take spicy food
4
Initially was ok till the waiter prepare the Chilli for us, he than opened the steamboat cover, the water dripped into the Chilli bowl. When I get him to change, he sort of show us a face of unwillingness but he still change.Because of this, I doubt him so I get help from another waitress to change for me
3
Ordered the red ruby which is a great disappointment :(The chestnut is bitter. We complained to the waitress who just took away the desert and returned saying it was cancelled, not even a apologetic smile. The waitress some more tells me (with a black face) that only i complained, nobody else :(
4
Long time since we last had such steamboat buffet dinner. Food was up to expectation and soup base (both Chicken stock and Tom Yum) were marvellous.
4
Came here with my family and ordered the steamboat buffet. Loved the signature dipping sauce as usual. Great place to have a steamboat buffet.
3
There were some hiccups here and there on the day of dining. All in all, we thought that the service standard could have been better.
3
The service was unexpectedly good, though the tomyam and chicken soup left me thirsty for a while after we had the meal.
4
Very fresh food, cockles especially. All the food is nice also. The soup base is good and flavourful.
4
We ordered the lunch buffet which was good and up to the expected standard. Later on we noticed there was a new innovative menu with special creations. Too bad we only saw that after we finished, look forward to trying next time.
3
no change to menu for long time but okay for lunch price. would be nice to see some new additions to the menu or else cannot dine there regularly.
5
Staff was friendly and nice. Food was really good. Price was affordable and service was TOP-notch. Will definitely go again.
3
It was a catch-up session with an old friend over lunch on a Thursday. For a change to buffet and cafe visit, she suggested Cocoa steamboat at Orchard. It was a refreshing idea because we get to enjoy two fanastic soup base (chicken and tom yum yum) without the stress of being hot and sweaty! However, the experience would be better if there are 2 or 3 more popular ingredients such crabs, scallops or maybe cheese tofu?
4
Too bad the collagen soup need to pay $25 and not much choice on the soup base... The serving is fast and waitress is helpful. Maybe can add in more foods choices. The cockles are fresh, the rest are okie too. But the cost abit high for per person as soup base cannot choose. That is the disadvantage for customers ~
3
The meats are not that fresh but the balls are nice. Nice service. They will auto refill the soup and sauce for you as well.
4
value for money, good variety of dishes. Kept having to prompt for drink refills, clear the table etc, but overall acceptable.
5
Good ambience at the restaurant and staff are all very friendly and willing to offer help. Drinks are replenished quickly and did not have to wait long for the ordered food to be served.
5
The service lady delivered a very good service and quick response to all our requests. Everyone were attentiv3 and responsive too.
4
This wasn't my first time here and it certainly won't be my last as well. Good food and good service.
3
Overall not bad. Service is good and prompt. Service staff are well trained. Put lesser warm lights as heat up the environment
5
Great service and friendly staffs. Will recommend family and friends for future gathering. Restaurant can have something special for occasional birthday would be nice!
3
The food quality and range was poor. Not value for money.
Could have gotten better buffet steamboat elsewhere.
4
Overall not too bad but could be better price can be reduced a little as not enough varieties to choose vege not enough. Buffet very little seafood to choose from
3
This Thai hotpot chain used to have many more outlets in Singapore. A bit puzzling that it has now dwindled to just five (and the one at Ngee Ann City is smaller than the previous one at the same location). The tom yum broth is quite yummy (albeit laden with MSG), the sauce flavourful, and the prices very reasonable. Maybe because the range is less attractive and service less grand compared to the competition? Strange, green but delicious soursop juice, so they don't serve any cola - Coca or Pepsi
5
Me and my friends we will go coca again , coz they are service is good and I like the location. I like coca .
5
Great experience and staffs were prompt in responding. Food is served fast and quality is great. Definitely coming back for more
4
I brought my family there for dinner and we all thoroughly enjoyed the food in this restaurant. Its a little expensive but i must say the food is really fresh. However the dessert were disappointing.
5
Great food and reasonable price! Service was wonderful and the staffs were very helpful as i had brought along my 4mth old baby.
4
The service from the ground is great.
Should look into the management of the service staff thou.
Not professional enough for COCA image.
4
We had a wonderful time in COCA restaurant , most of the food were fresh except the flower crabs . Otherwise, we will come back again。
4
decent buffet with fresh food. The service and the food served were good value buffet lunch cost $27++ exclude towel & plain water charge 50cents each
5
Was there the past wkend (24.04.16) for a family lunch. very pleased with the service. always done with a smile. food was served quickly after the order. would definitely visit again.
5
The dipping sauce was still the highlight of this restaurant. For people who don't want to overeat, I would recommend ordering from the a la carte menu which gives a bigger portion than the ones in the buffet menu. In the end, my sister and I ordered from the a la carte and ended paying just the equivalent of one pax for the buffet
3
Service staff at entrance just stood there when we arrived, looking at us No one uttered anything. I informed them I placed a reservation earlier but no one understood English. Until 1 other staff came up to assist.Even the staff bringing out the food could not communicate in English except for 1 or 
4
Great value lunch offering a wide variety of meats, seafood and vegetables. We ordered the chicken and the beef; the latter a trifle chewy. The veggies is what work well and the chilly sauce with chopped coriander made all the difference

A great place to have fresh and quality hot pot. It comes with their in house speciality sauce. Excellent to go well with the food. Service is good and pricing is nicely priced. A place must visit if you love hot pot !!!

We are only late for 2 minutes, when the time my friend reached there, the staff there said want to give me call. I hope they can understand and hold the table at least 20 minutes or less. But not only 2 minutes.

Restaurant was able to accommodate changes in timing and headcount. Service was prompt and excellent but the variety for buffet was rather limited.

Will come.again and recommend to others.
It will be good if the price can be more reasonable to attract more customers.

Food is so so. Orders were missed out , and wrongly served. They didn't open on time. We didn't get the best service in terns of what's best to recommend for alternatives

The waiters there are very friendly, the food were fresh and my friend was very delighted. Hope to visit there again soon.

Book 1115am but they only start at 1120am. Ask for better seat but rejected as they are reluctant to open more area. Like to crowd diners together. No meaning for me to be early bird or reserve seat on advance. My last visit guarantee.taste is different from what I know 10 years ago

Food is fresh. Soup base is quite nice. There was a time limit of 2 hour for the table, felt it was a bit rush to enjoy the dinner with the family. Nevertheless, if there is no such limitation, the wait for the next patrons would be longer . Overall it is reasonable

I think you should be aware of the service rendered and language that one of your employees is using in your restaurant Coca (#04-23 Ngee Ann City)His identification tag shows the name Alex (attached image) I was shocked as a restaurant manager being so disrespectful to a mother.My wife has made reservation and clearly stated 5 pax with 1 baby in a pram. Your staff asked if i need a high chair to which i decline. Upon my arrival at the restaurant in ngee ann city, your staff Alex told her to park the pram at the entrance, which she said she couldn't as my baby will be in the pram. He proceeded to tell her that the table allocated to me has no clear path for a stroller. He obviously thinks that all babies born out of the womb can sit from day 1!!!! So she asked him for alternative... We were glad for a moment when he got us another table (forgiving the fact that he rudely guestured us to enter by back door without explaining). To my dismay, he is putting me at a booth table and expect me to put my baby in the stroller in the very narrow walkway which is also where the servers will have to serve the food. Seriously do you think i will allow your staff to serve steaming hot steamboat over my baby? To make matters worse, your staff Alex was just very nonchanlant about it all and was very rude throughout the whole time. He was not even apologetic that he got the reservations wrong and now i can't dine at your restaurant. This is highly unacceptable and Alex is a disgrace to the service industry! I would appreciate a response on this.I personally feel he has no place interacting with family when he lacks the most basic sense of propriety and kindness. He seemed to think it was funny. I don't know how many people he has offended, but I found it so offensive that I will not allowed my family or friends to experience such incident again.Father of a 4 month old son.Shawn Sw

Good food, attentive and efficient service by ultra friendly staff, nice ambience and great location.

Staffs are friendly but the orders we made always lack of a few items don't go according to the order list
4
It's quite costly for 2 of us to order the buffet and cost me $110! But I do enjoy the food. Hope it can review on the price.
4
The service staffs are prompt to react with our request and the food are fresh. The atmosphere of the restaurant is just nice too.

Restaurant is located in a great location in town, mid range of buffet selections but fresh with good quality, fairly priced.

We went there for buffet to celebrate friend's birthday. They always missed out some item whenever we placed an order.

The food at the dinner buffet was excellent especially the dipping sauce. Our booking was for 8.30 pm but they offered a table at around 7.30 pm. Although we had only an hour to enjoy the buffet but the experience was overall worth it! The environment is comfortable and we did not smell at all at the movie after dinner. The only thing we hope they can improve upon is service - they could have been more attentive to refilling the soup base when there is little in the pot.

Overall it is a recommended place for buffet lunch at $27++ everyday including weekend/PH. Lunch was good but keep it within a small group of 4 - 6 pax. The only disappointment is they have some selection out of stock with no other replacement. Don't have a wide spread of selection on the buffet menu but it is still worth a try given the charges is reasonable at Orchard area. Service staffs are quite efficient to refill drinks and soup base.

No compaints about the quality of coca food. In face, it has to be good based on the price they charge. However, do not expect service from this outlet. A pity the former outlet at International Building is no longer opened because the service of the staff there cannot be compared with this outlet. All the staff do not smile. NOT even one really! They made you feel as if you cause them more work by patronizing the outlet there. Nobody bother to ask you what beverages would you want until you have to ask them. Even so, the waiter looked unhappy we ordered from him. Tea was Never refilled automatically. We have to ask for glasses to be refilled throughout the meal. The same with their famous chilli sauce. You have to ask for it yourself. Whenever we passed the order forms to any of the waiters, they just kept a straight face, looking as if you were bothering them. You may be having a happy gathering with family or friends but this bunch of staff will just spoil your mood! We will try out the Kallang outlet next. The RWS outlet is ok though.

Service staff not interested in their service more keen to provide service for table of 4 or more. Asked for replenish of chilli sauce the waiter just pour the whole bottle in. Pathetic.

The yam is awesome, but there is not much varieties to choose and the pricing is not so value for money.

I have been looking for a good steamboat buffet restaurant and I am glad to fiind Coca Singapore by chance when I was at Takashimaya...

Great ambience. Fresh steamboat ingredients. Enjoy my dinner with friends where we get to eat n chitchat.

When u r standing at the entrance waiting, the staffs dont acknowledge you. I stand for quite a while before someone noticed me. The restaurant service is bad and we have to look for service staffs to place order. Food is decent. Could have been a decent place to dine if not for the bad service

Premise: we are expat here so my review is for westerns and expats. We tried as we wanted to understand how steam boating works. It is fun for the family but too spicy for us: the chicken soup is too mild (not spicy) and the tomato soup is too spicy for us. The food was good: the meat a bit too fat, but vegetables were really nice. Not too expensive but woudn't go again: it is simply too far from our culture. Personnell very nice. Location very clean and central

This is my first time to visit this buffet restaurant. I was quite impressed with the serving of the food choices. I ordered and they are served in each individual plate within minutes. You could go as many as you could eat. However, I felt the range of food may not be as wide hence you may end up calling the same food after the first ordering. Overall the ambience is that of a high end Chinese restaurant serving buffet in a cooling environment. You could a glass of red or white wine to go alon

Have ate hear on a number of occasions as it is my wife's favorite place to eat in Taka. For me it is OK and you cannot really go wrong with steam boat as long as the ingredients you are cooking are fresh. On this day we had a small table for 4 and it was very tight seating, noisy and you felt in a rush as they have two sitting in the evening. I will definitely be back as the food is fresh.

Fresh ingredients and clean place to have a marvellous steamboat!!!Get to choose between 3 types of soups, chicken, tom yam and abalone.Seating was quick as we have a reservation. It will be recommended to reserve a place for the dinner buffet as it get filled up really fast with customers

Fancy steamboat place in the shopping centre - a great range to choose from regarding meats, seafood, vegtables and tofu. Service is prompt and professional, carefully staging the arrival of different dishes. The broth at the end tastes amazing! A good one for tourists who want to try something from Asian cuisine concepts
