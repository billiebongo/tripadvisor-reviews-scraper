We tried for the 1st time at Changi Village stall on Nov 2016. We came by lunch hour. Variety of dishes and delicious taste attracted many people. Therefore be prepare for long queue during lunch hour. Very satisfied with the service attitude and price, reasonable. Recommend to anyone visited to Changi Village

Visited this stall at Golden Shoe. The price is cheap at S$2.50/- for a pack of rice with hainanese pork chop and egg ser. Added an extra luncheon meat for S$3/- in total. They also have cha siew on offer. The curry is nice. So is the pork chop. Expect long queue during lunch time
