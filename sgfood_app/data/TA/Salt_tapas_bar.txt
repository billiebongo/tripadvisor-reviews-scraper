Loved the food options for the restaurant's valentines menu. The in-house sangria still does not fail to disappoint as well!

Have not been for a while. Really enjoyed the food. The set lunch was very good and place is not noisy. So good for business meeting. Staff is attentive.
4
Great Food and Great ambience. Great for after office hours gathering and also family gatherings! Would bring my family next time!
5
Amazing food, great service. Some of the items of the menu are new, but as usual the qulaity is excellent.
4
Great food. Just pricy and they didn’t have the more worthwhile large sets for sharing. So just beware the expensive starters
4
We enjoyed the athmosphere in this restaurant. People were nice and food was good. We took the 5 tapas for 50 sgd (with GST). So price was quite ok after all.
5
It's a central place to meet friends and have a quick drink and bite after work before heading home. The tapas are tasty and not too heavy to spoil your dinner.
3
Great location, helpful staff.Ran out of oysters and salt and pepper squid before 7:30pm dinner on a Sunday.Roasted prawns with chorizo was nice. Prawns could have been a bit firmer.Grilled baby octopus was just right and the taste of the octopus wasn't drowned out. Potatoes were nice.The main meal was the pork ribs, miso & honey soy glazed with apple & wasabi slaw. Sounds delicious. The pork was cooked just right and was tender. Unfortunately the miso nor the honey shone through but was was overpowered by oil which made the taste bland and stayed in the mouth even after cleansing a few times with a drink.I've eaten here before and usually very tasty but tonight was too oily and bland

Cannot visit Singapore without having the signature beverage. This is the place to go to have the ultimate “Sling”. Raffles is closed for remodeling, but across the street as you look at the Raffles Hotel you will sip the best “Sling” around. Carefully made with a mixture fresh from the individual bottles (Raffles when open uses a premix). Delicious in the perfect atmosphere! Thr mixer Raj) and the server (Chandra) treat you like royalty.Do not pass this up, and the price is better than most
5
Atmosphere: Came here on a rainy day. But the environment was relaxing amidst the hustle and bustle of Raffles City/ CBD environment. Service: The staff members made you feel right and were attentive to your eating and drinking habits. Food: Try the tapas here. They were having a promo at 5 tapas for S$50. Serving can reasonably be shared by 2 people. The fried squid is worth it as the serving was the largest. The beef burgers were the smallest, holding at 2 mini burgers per tapas. but it was good too nonetheless. End of your tapas with a dessert. I had churros, and it was very good too.
4
Salt Tapas offers a $19++ set lunch with 1 main course and coffee/tea. The barramundi was delicious and is recommended. Ambience was lovely. A nice lunch venue.
4
very delicious!!!! though its pricy but if you wanna try some nice exotic food in the middle of the city. this is the place to go! salad and tuna is perfect.
5
Food was great as usual. Lunch set has great value. Highlight - their Churros.
Even the complimentary coffee was good.
5
I have been wanting to try the food there. It was an excellent choice for me and my husband. The food is very good and the price is reasonable.
5
We had dinner at Xmas eve. Not over crowded as usual. Tapas selection is good. Paella had too much curry, not like Spanish. Flat iron steak was very nice. Friendly service. Excellent!

We are rebounding from a trip to Myanmar, so everything seems fancy and expensive, location is not bad, nice to be outside of the mega malls. The restaurant was not busy, but we had to negotiate to get a table for dinner ( rather than sit at the bar). Our wine choice - I think it was a house Pinot, took ages, and was incorrect.the food came faster thanMacDonalds. We had to slow it down as we were up to 3 of 5 tapas before the wine arrived. Food was pretty good actually ( again viewed after 2 weeks eating same same curry). Expensive given the huge competition and that’s probably why is wasn’t ful
1
Popped in for lunch today.Although everything looks great on the menu, let me a sure you that it is certainly not that way when it is put on a plate in front of you. I’m extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. Especially with the taramasalata and spanakopita. The spanakopita did not have any flavour and was panfriend in what smelt like coconut oil. We also ordered a cheeseboard there was not enough biscuits and we were only served with four grapes. Definitely not worth $22 the staff are really really friendly and I happy to provide you with any advice or questions that you may have. I would not recommend this restaurant and will definitely be steering clear of this place.If I were the chef of this establishment I would definitely not be proud at all
5
Great place to have good tapas and excellent service by Chandra. Outdoor dinning is great with a view of the Raffles Hotel.My husband and i orderd a Jug Sangria, grilled baby octupus,couliflower, house salad, padron oepper, pork belly taco, truffle salami and coffee (latte) Excellent quality and fresh food.Highly recommend

We tried this place when it just first opened many years ago but we only returned this month as our visiting friends chose it. We were only going to have drinks but we decided to try the tapas.Now I remember why we haven’t gone back all these years. Nothing on the menu jumps out as something we’d like to try. Of the tapas we tried, we didn’t find any of them as particularly good. There is nothing wrong with the food. I think it’s just the style is not for us. (It’s similar with the other Salt restaurant. Nothing wrong with the food at all - just that it’s not our type so we struggled to choose from the menu.)I had a negroni for a drink while we were waiting for our friends. It was pretty weak and had lots of ice so by the time I’ve drank half and the ice started to melt, it was like a negroni-flavoured water.The staff are professional and friendly so that made up for it. But we won’t be back again, not even for drinks because I can’t go there for negroni

Luke Mangan's Singapore venture is a winner. Having a spectacular street presence and top location is the first standout but is well backed up with great food and fabulous presentation, all you would expect from an international foodsmith. Value for money is exceptional, drink range fantastic and quality of service if first class. This could easily become a Singapore regular when in town..... if you can get in. Highly recommended
4
Went there with a group of friends. A great place for sharing food and drinking and chatting with friends. Will definitely go back again. This place is more suitable for drinking crowds. Happy hours ends at 7pm. After that, their drinks can be quite expensive.
4
Took the Tapas menu 5 for 50 $. Could have fed 2, was very good, very large choice including desert...the environment is nice as the service perfect... smile and effectiveness. Good experience at a reasonable price ... especially if there is 2 of you !
4
We had a lovely dinner at Salt two days ago. The food was tasty and unique and the service was good. The beer my son ordered was a tad flat though so the bar management should ensure this issue is resolved soonest possible.
4
The ambience of the restaurant is cozy with nice interior deco. Cold cuts are great! Chorizo are good too.
5
We had six tapas dishes and each one was different, clever and delicious and a dish we would like to eat again.
3
The service is really excellent. Waitresses rare very attentive and the location is very nice. The prices are okay, the only comment that I would make is that the quality of the food could be better for such a good place. The appetizers were not very fresh
4
Nice food, a pity that I went just with my wife, didn't get to try the variety of main courses. don't mind going again.Please remedy your website, can't choose other options other than "Very Good" and "Excellent" for Food, Value, Service and Atmosphere. Value and Atmosphere at this restaurant was "Average"
3
Just average. Nothing bad and nothing great. Good choices on menu but felt slightly let down by when the meals arrived. Could have had more meat in the sliders and far too much sauce and other stuff on some of the other choices. As I say not bad but better places to eat for this price nearby
3
My wife and I sat on an outside table which was intimate and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the main road despite its proximity. The atmosphere was pleasant but I was surprised by the lack of diners on a Saturday night; most tables were not occupied.We went for a set of 5 starter size plates. All were tasty and interesting. We followed up with a flat iron steak which we shared. Whilst quite alright, the steak lacked any special quality and I've had better quality at other restaurants in Singapore.We tried a bottle of sparkling Aussie chenin blanc which was drinkable but somewhat forgettable. I was also surprised that a malbec I had by the glass lacked punch which I would have expected to cut through the rich food. Maybe the food made the wines taste milder?All in all a decent meal, but my big gripe is the cost which was far higher than the meal and setting justified. We hardly ate or drank tons yet the bill was almost $300. I would have expected more
3
The 1st vivid we has the flat bread, salmon sashimi and beef steak. All 3 dishes were excellent 5* dishes. Great flavours. Was a little expensive, but worth it.Loved it so much returned the next night. Flat bread had run out. Ordered another entree, salmon then beef steak and lamb kofta. Waiter returned, beef steak not available !!Whilst the lamb kofta was excellent, our two alternate dishes were average, especially given it’s not cheap.I’m surprised given the types of dishes that they could run out ! !Disappionted with second night
3
An excellent location for a casual meal, close to major hotels (Fairmont, Raffles etc.) and transport, open and relaxing atmosphere - nothing special about the food, enjoyable but no wow factor
5
Found this restaurant by chance and so glad we did. The food was exceptional; sharing plates of Wagu beef, truffled potatoes, and brilliant deserts. With several glasses of wine and sherries it was just over Gbp100 for two.
4
Had lunch with my husband - shared a couple of plates - food was ok - I believe the food in Luke's restaurant in Australia is better - the service could have been better - but great location looking out on the main shopping strop of Singapore
1
Went with an overseas guest. Left my choices of the tapas to the seemingly experienced service staff who offered. Ended with four plates of bread-based tapas and one sashimi. When he realised the combination could be better, he offered to make up by giving us coffee or desserts on the house. We were filled up by the bread already and declined but since he was so apologetic and kept asking, I decided to get a coffee. When I reached home and checked the bill, I realised the coffee was charged to me. Baffled
3
We went there for a quick bite and a drink. The food was nice and service pleasant. Why I marked it down is because after paying the bill we did not get the change and has to ask for it, not nice. I would have left the lot.
4
Tapas are perfect food for a location like Singapore. There are so many food choices and fusion is the nature of the beast here. With Salt, they have it down, and done very well. As a solo traveller I need a barstool option when I go looking for food. It's no fun sitting on your own at a "regular table". I got a seat at the bar near a fellow solo traveller and the food, company and service were top notch. This one is on the must return list for my next time in town
3
Easily accessible as it is next to one of the main MRT station in Singapore.Ambience is nice and cosy. Selection and standard of food is ok. I would say average. Ribs were a tad too tough and dry. Service can be improved. We asked for recommendations for a vegan friend and the waitress proceeded to introduce the meat selections. We had to repeat a few times befoÅ•e she got it.Another incident was a waitress losing her temper when we informed her the order was wrong . Most amazing was they insisted that they got it right and we should accept the order as is. Though we finally got the manager to cancel the wrong order in the end it was not a pleasant process. Spoilt our night. Will not come back again
5
We really enjoyed our impromptu family gathering at Salt Tapas & Bar on Friday night. The ambience was fantastic and service was impeccable. All the staff were friendly and very attentive. We didn't have to wait long for our food and almost everything we tried was fantastic. Our favourite were the beef sliders, the Spanakopita and the cheese platter. Pity we missed the happy hour. Highly recommended and we will definitely be back
4
The food here is delicious, so it was rather surprising that the place was so quiet at lunchtime on a Sunday. The only grouse we had was that the servings of the tapas were too large: we wanted to try other tapas, which would have been possible had the servings been smaller, as they often are at other tapas restaurants. So we only ordered two, as recommended by the waiter, and soon found that too much of a good thing can still make one sated
4
Salt Tapas & Bar has a good lunch set menu - $19 for a main course, with coffee or tea. The Spanakopita (Greek spinach and feta pie) and baby barramundi fillet are both delicious. We like how they are flexible with offering a range of coffee (cappuccino, latte etc) and teas. We ordered a coffee mousse with salted caramel ice-cream for dessert and that was just lovely!
4
The set lunch was simple, came with a choice of tea/coffee or soft drink. The ambient was nice. Service was good.
5
Great service. Ask for Jay if you want a awesome cocktail. Food is sensational. Fantastic atmosphere. Didn't want to leave.
4
It's not their fault that the service can be at times slow due to the huge crowds. Great for hanging out with friends to people-watch in the City Hall area!
5
Good wines the tapas are varied, I prefer what we used to get in Spain but still those on offer are worth trying out as something different. Good service and a welcoming atmosphere. Does get busy in the evening/weekends but worth the effort.
5
At sgd19 for lunch, it is a great find for a weekday lunch gathering. Great food, good drinks and please-to-serve service, it's on my to-visit again list.

Conveniently located on the ground level of a hotel, office tower and mall, this restaurant is usually packed at meal times. Their tapas and service are however only average, failing to leave an impression nor desire to return.
1
I am actually a returning customer because I really enjoyed the food the first time round. But the fact that the service was so bad the second time means prob we will never return again. Firstly we had to try least 5-6 times to get the waiters' attention each time we wanted to either add an order, request for water, or even just to get the bill. And whatever we ordered did not seem to arrive and we had to often make a second request. The one thing I didn't understand was why a waiter seemingly facing us, can consistently not see us trying to get his attention, yet seems enthusiastic to serve the expat customers around us. He basically ignored us and moved straight each time to the expats who were seated around us. In the end we had to avoid him and get the attention of another waiter instead (who was much much better). It was no better at the end of the dinner. For the bill I literally walked up to counter just so that I could make my payment instead of having to wait at my table, simply because the waiter who arrived at the table simply dropped the bill, and went off, even though I was taking out my wallet ready to pay. Eventually the lady manager indicated to the cashier we were making payment, and he too simply dropped the printout, made no afford whatever with eye contact, nor a word of thanks. Very much disappointed, and mood for the evening ruined by the entire bad experience, I took my card signed and left. It really is a pity because, I really loved the food and ambience of the place, but I don't see why customers should return if they are not appreciated or even accorded basic courtesy
5
Excellent choice of starters... we were 6 and kept ordering ! We loved their flat bread, roasted prawns and salmon sashimi !! Crew was good and friendly... we ended up trying 3 different wines and Australian Martini ! Good place to hang out tasty food !

During my Wife and I's recent honeymoon through Singapore we went out for dinner at the Salt Tapas and Bar. We picked this place as it was conveniently close to our hotel (Naumi Hotel) and from the outside looked really nice.The restaurant does have a great ambience and is delightfully decorated throughout, although I did feel a little too close to another couple from where we were seated.The staff and service was OK, it wasn't too slow but I felt they didn't look the happiest. Our food was a mixture of starters and mains, including some chicken, steak, vegetables and breads. The food was all quite good although if I was being really picky the steak I asked for was a little under cooked, which was not a real issue.Price from what I remember was fairly reasonable. Overall I have been to much more authentic tapas bars, the menu felt small and not very adventurous
5
Chose to eat here as it was opposite our hotel and it looked really good. The staff were friendly and welcoming and showed us how to order recommending 3 dishes we should definitely try. We had 6 dishes between the 2 of us. The quality and presentation was fab and it was all delicious. We added 1 dish at a time to our order after the initial 3 and this was not a problem. Would definitely recommend
4
The $19 set lunch offered by Salt Tapas & Bar is pretty decent. It includes a main course with either a soft drink, coffee or tea. The ambience was nice, as was the service staff.
5
Had just arrived at Singapore, staying at the Raffles Hotel. Salt was just across the road. Food was excellent as was the service. Would happily return againfor this casual experience.
5
The service, the food, the people....these are always so welcome! The people are friendly but leave you your privacy. The standard of food is consistently great, so Salt, please keep it up!
4
We had a reservation, cause its a very popular place.
Order what they waiter recommended, and we were not disappointing. Both food and drinks.
5
Having just arrived in Singapore early evening we were not overly hungry for dinner. We came across this restaurant a short walk from our hotel and having perused their menu we decided to give it a go. We were not disappointed.We ordered three dishes. The scallops were fresh and tasty whilst the quail (on special that night) would be the best we had ever tasted. It wasn't overly priced although like the rest of Singapore, alcoholic beverages are mightily dear.All in all a pleasant experience which is highly recommended
5
I spent an evening with two colleagues at the Salt Tapas bar. We had drinks, appetizers and Tapas. Our waiter was instantly aware of and able to guide me to gluten free options in order to make my meal to my needs. We were outdoors in a relatively comfortable evening and enjoyed the atmosphere, view and food. Very convenient to the Fairmont hotel. A bit spendy, about $350SGD for three persons.
3
When we stepped into the restaurant there was a Wine Talk/Workshop in progress. The speaker had to speak loudly as the group was big. This is very disturbing as the rest of us do not wish to listen to his explanations but had no choice. The schedule of workshop should have ended before the first lunch customer stepped into the restaurant.
5
This busy city restaurant faces the famous Raffles Hotel and is included in the Raffles City shopping centre, but with its own street entrance. The taxi rank is just around the corner. Our waiter introduced himself and gave suggestions of dishes he liked or were popular choices. He also advised how many dishes to order. We shared starters and mains, and had plenty of food, all of it delicious. Plenty of choices for wines and beers, and house wines available too. Mains are not ordered until starters have been cleared, and the waiter asked if we were ready to have them begun. A separate wine waiter dealt with those orders attentively. Desserts can also be shared. Check the website for the current menu
5
After our visit to Raffles Long Bar, we walked across the road the to Luke Mangans Salt Tapas Bar. Lots of helpful enthusiastic staff, we had the very capable Max. Plenty to choose from on the delicious Menu. We enjoyed a great evening drinking and eating , we were not rushed to leave .Very clean ,environment
1
We stopped by for an afternoon cocktail and when we saw Japanese Slippers on the list, decided to revisit an old favourite. It tasted like cordial! It should be sweet and sour, clearly no fresh lime juice was used. When asked they said they never use fresh lime juice and it was indeed a cordial..... dont put it on the list if you dont understand what the cocktail is! We were offered a replacement drink and ordered gin and tonic thinking you cant get that wrong in Singapore however we couldnt taste any gin and the tonic was flat! Needless to say we gave up at that point and left! The manager offered to make us another drink on the house but we felt two goes at getting it right was enough! I know it was "happy hour" however that should not effect the quality of the drinks
4
It was great to visit the restaurant in the afternoon. The atmosphere was so relax and nice. I will visit here again in the future
5
We came for lunch with friends and had the best experience. It was actually my third time and have loved every time I've been. Happy hour is on every afternoon. The food us absolutely delicious and staff are very good.
4
Good food and service. Al Fresco seatng in Singapore for lunch not ideal but the interior seating was nice and cool.
3
Unique ambience for casual dining. Wide variety choices for food. Great services and minimum waiting time.
5
Celebrated my teen daughter's birthday here. Ordered per restaurant manager Jose Clemente's recommendation. Wagyu brisket mini burger. 3-some meats platter. Burrata. Salmon sashimi. Flat iron steak. Excellent dishes. Treated to complimentary churros for my daughter.
5
We had a great time at Salt Bar - the food was delicious and although slightly smaller portions than one would typically be used to it was still filling!
2
The food was decent ...except maybe the cauliflower tapas which was dull...but my my main concern was we were given the wrong bill with extra drinks on it.It is hard to keep track of orders in a tapas bar so the last thing you need is the bill to be wrong. There were beers and soft drinks we didn't order on our bill.We sent the bill back and then they gave us a new bill with another set of random drink added. The lady waitress was nice so we gave it a 2 rating instead of 1 and the manager offered us a free meal if we return which helped a little.The suckling pig with pear was nice but a bit small for $60
4
Nice combination of inside and outside tables on the edge of the Raffles City shopping complex and very close to the entrance of the Fairmont Hotel for those guests wanting to eat outside the hotel without venturing too far. Good tapas even if not terribly authentic. Group of us enjoyed a nice mix of platters washed down with some Cava
5
This would have to be one of the best places in Singapore to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon eating awesome food. We had the Maitre'd select for us and she did an amazing job. The beef sliders were incredible. The setting is extremely well done even by Singapore standards. I highly recommend this restaurant for its quality, service and atmosphere. Kids are welcome or they were when we were there early afternoon on a saturday.It's a must go venue if you are in Sing!!
3
We stopped here sort of impulsively, very hungry, as it wasn't far from our hotel and seemed to have a decent menu. Having literally no impressions of the place, we were pleasantly surprised with our food. The food is tapas in style, as the name implies, but portions are more generous than one might expect. The dishes with burrata were especially lovely, and we had a delicious flatbread with rosemary and tomatoes, which was far more delicious than anticipated. The service was not particularly good, however. Even our first request to order seemed to be a major inconvenience. Further, our waitress messed up our order. While it was fixed, she fussed quite a bit about the error and needing to make a chance. She did not seem particularly familiar with the menu, which is likely what caused the mistake. While it was fixed, the service made no favorable impressionsOverall, this food was a perfectly fine meal, and reasonably priced, given Singapore standards. There were some nice highlights with food, and it's worth a stop if you're hungry in the area -- and don't mind mediocre service
4
Although we were late eating we received good service and greta food. I can highly recommend the lamb shoulder. A little noisy and the staff were anxious to leave so we couldn't linger.
4
Delicious food, yummy and pretty dessert 😍Can't ask for more! Its Paella is a must try. Good ambience and kind staffs. So relaxing to be there.
4
Nice food with good service. Tapas was delicious with a nice variety of choice. Mains were good too. Love the fish! And the dessert was really tasty too.
4
Enjoyed the relaxing place to chill out for drinks & tapas.
All enjoyed everything
Only downer was if you sat outside it was close to the main mall & hotel smoking area.
4
Service staff was attentive, Food and portion was good , and so was the atmosphere in the room. We will definitely return.
5
A favorite, Salt Tapas & Bar is one of the best eating and watering places in town. Always dependable for a good, tasty meal, I'd call it comfort food with a few nice surprises and always great service and ambience, although it can get a little loud inside when it's packed. Go for the poultry dishes, they're usually tasty with a crisp outer layer that'll keep you licking your fingers after you're done. The BBQed Quail has this addictive onion ring side and aioli that was the highlight of our meal. Also the cheese and charcuterie platter. Drinks are good here too. The new menu is missing some former hits like the spatchcock/spring chicken and octopus salad, but everything's still good (although I wasn't so crazy about the fish with beans special...). Next time, I'll probably try the crispy whitebait, Spanakopita and wagyu steak â€“ if I don't get sucked in by the quail again! *Too* good
4
Lovely interesting European influenced food with casual not overworked dishes, hence the tapas name I guess.Ate there about 1 1/2 yrs ago, still as good as I remembered.One problem for me as a solo traveler, the 'format' has changed to sharing dishes which I don't remember as being the case on the earlier visit.As such I was restricted to a couple of entrees, as the mains were definitely too much for one - such a pity, so wouldn't recommend this restaurant first up.I was disappointed by this change as increasing evidence builds that more people are not just living solo but travelling solo - too bad if you're not a 'couple' of some sort
4
Somewhere slightly different from a lot in Singapore. Food very good and the service was attentive and helpful as the waiter took time to explain the dishes and advise on quantities for 4 of us to share. We all enjoyed the food and washed it down with some beers and wine.We then got the bill and suddenly realised that it was almost like buying the whole building. Expensive even by Singapore standards
4
Booked a table firn4 for dinner on Friday night through Chope. Somehow it didn't show on the system at Salt tapas. The captain was most gracious. She sat us at the bar, offered free drinks while she arranged for a table in the crowded restaurant The service was prompt and attentive , and the waitress even advised us not to order a 3rd main as it would have been too much. She was right! We had enough to doggy bag. The food and drinks were excellent , especially the burrata, barramundi and churros. Thanks.
3
This was my first visit. Great food and ambience. Welcome service was a bit cold and distant as there was no one at the entrance. When someone did finally arrive, hardly a smile and walked me to the table. No effort to ascertain if this was a first visit or just small talk to make a connection. Servers were unable to explain more about the food, given this was our first trip - just a simple, "yes this is good" (almost for every question we asked). We had the tapas only - prawns, charred cauliflower, burrata, a cheesecake and 2 sets of beef sliders.For drinks we had 3 wines ($10 each at happy hour) a mojito (not on happy hour) and a juice and we paid a whooping $180!!! For 2 pax and just tapas and drinks, that's mighty expensive.
4
All was great! Except that i had requested for a small cake surprise for my fren. But that was not done. Otherwise good.
4
Stepping in, we (my wife and I) were already feeling good as we loved the decor. The food was good, small bites packed with flavour. All this was washed down with fresh draft beer. Very satisfying.
5
We booked Salt because it was close to our hotel and also owned by a fellow Melbournian, Luke Mangan. We had the set price menu and it was fabulous. Superb fish, fantastic desserts and super friendly and attentive staff.
5
Not sure why anyone would call this pricey, so I presume some reviewers are new to Singapore. By global city standards this place is great value. I have reviewed it before, however given I have dined here a dozen times I think it worth another review. I have had work lunches for two, a corporate entertaining lunch for three, romantic dinner for two, corporate dinner for four, dinner for six, a Sunday brunch with a mate, so to lunch with five friends this time. So this time, like every time, great on all fronts. Given I am always with different people, no one really singles me out for special treatment. So this is just the way they roll. Lunch has a $19 special for a choice of five mains and a cuppa, plus they do happy hours wines by the glass at $10 and beer bottles even less. That's saying something in Singapore. The food is sensational. Pearl barley under salmon and prawns. Wagyu cooked and sliced perfectly. Pork ribs, wow. And many more. We all loved it. This is one of our absolute Singapore sureties, a credit to the kitchen and floor staff and Mr Mangan, thank you!
3
Being keen tapas restaurant visitors in the UK, didn't find any of my favourites on the menu. Starters were described as platters to share but luckily we ordered one each as they could hardly be called platters. Food was tasty and interesting. Just not a lot of it
5
Amazing food, amazing wine, amazing staff. The place is wonderful and the waiters are super nice with really good recommendations on what to order. Always attentive, smiling and even making conversation. It's a bit expensive but the food it's amazingly good!!! Try the mashroom, salmon sashimi and cheeses!!!!
4
Had dinner at Salt Tapas & Bar and was not disappointed. We both ordered flat iron steak and truffle fries and the food was served hot and flavorful. The meat was properly cooked to the ordered temperature and the presentation was nice. Overall, a pleasant meal and a restaurant worth visiting
3
Arrived in Singapore in the evening after a long flight, and at 8pm requiring a "snack" a Trip Advisor search of nearby eateries helped us select Salt. We walked in off the street and were quickly settled by attentive staff. Ordered 4 small dishes to share with the help of staff, plus a half pint of tap beer and a glass of house Sav Blanc. The food was excellent but we recommend the house wine be avoided. Luke, with all the lovely Savs in the world to offer a poor house wine was very disappointing.
4
Pricey joint for sure but some really nice food. We had the wagyu steak tapas and hand cut french fries, churros and the rosemary flat bread.The flat bread had a tomato like sauce on it which made it a bit soggier than what I expected. The hand cut chips with cheese weren't the greatest as again they were really thick and not crispy.the wagyu steak was lovely, the service was great and the atmosphere/location was nice. Felt like a classy lunch, with the price tag to match but overall a good experience.For the sugar addicts the churros are amazing!
4
Offer a very good fixed price lunch menu with one course plus soft drink or tea/coffee for SGD19. This is good value for the Raffles City complex.A fair number of choices on the menu with both meat and fish options. The small burger I had was very good
4
Food was good but a little pricey. Staff offered good service. Enjoyed the sliders. Was able to walk in and get a table without waiting.
5
This place offers some great and tasty food. We visited for lunch and had a few small dishes to help with the Tiger beer and wine for the ladies. Great place. Unfortunate we didn't have time to do an evening meal here.
5
Scallop Tartar; we will have another stopover in Singapore just to eat this dish again. The service was great, the rest of the food was great. The scallops were incredible - amazing - awesome - unbeatable!
4
Great spot right opposite Raffles. Good service and reasonable prices for Singapore.
Nice place to sit and watch the world go by
5
Located in raffles city this is a great spot for food with an eclectic array of Mediterranean fusion dishes. They have a nice selection of cocktails and wines. The staff are friendly and attentive. Indoor and outdoor seating.
4
The idea of tapas is getting several smaller dishes and sharing - music service food was pretty good - was not cheap but don't recall feeling it was over the top

Now that's a pretty big claim to make in this town where the drink is prolific, but following extensive personal research over a week long stay I can say so confidently. Did not eat here so can not comment on food, though what was brought to surrounding tables certainly looked good. Perfect spot to sip your Sling whilst looking at the grand building in which it was created
4
Food here has always made me come back, craving for more. Service is good enough for me. They change their menu every few months, which is a good thing but when u love an item and its no longer on the menu, it can be quite disappointing.
5
a very strategic location, beautiful scenery. we here celebrate the birthday of my wife's mother and along with a whole family, first came in here directly felt its opulence, was greeted by a very friendly, all the staff here are very helpful and friendly. starting from the best all food mainly for its meat is very high quality and in accordance with the price. very satisfactory service, wine waiter was very experienced in ordering our wine selection to match. we got a shock at the time of desserts, desserts were beautiful to not be able to eat it, very beautiful, my wife's mother was very happy, on this restaurant. we will be back again in the future. Very recommended.
5
Loved the meal. We first came here two years ago and wanted to see if it had changed. From the sharing menu we ordered the Flat Iron steak with mushrooms and truffle polenta and the Pork ribs with apple and wasabi slaw. Both single portions with a bottle of the house merlot. Fantastic ! Our waitress was Charmaine and we couldn't have been looked after better. The wine is a little pricey but we didn't let that spoil a superb evening. We are back in a month and will definitely call in again
3
Food was pretty good as was location and ambiance. Reasonable vale. This said, a far cry from anything resembling authentic Spanish food
5
I love the casual but classy style. The food was amazing that suprised me with little creative bits in every dish. Portion and selection mixture were just perfectly planned. Price was reasonable. Good services.
5
Right opposite Raffles, we came across this tapas bar. Albeit nosy from traffic, the food was simply delightful. Staff attentive and knowledgeable and so nice we visited on two occasions. Of special mention was the salmon sashimi which we thoroughly recommend.
5
Great food and prices reasonable for Singapore. Take advantage of Happy Hour if you can as the drinks are reasonable prices. Food is great!
5
Nice ambiance, great service crew and food quality :)! My wife and I enjoyed the Valentine's dinner we had.
3
We had a light lunch there. Atmosphere is fine but food is so so. We chose three starters. Salmon sashimi - looked and tasted ordinary - didn't match expectations of the menu and would not reorder. Then brisket sliders - tasted pretty good but were measly little portions of brisket and didn't really shout anything different. Final portion was charred cauliflower - give this a miss. It was drowning in some yellow sauce, and had raisins and nuts and didn't know whether it wanted to be a salad or desert. Would possibly return to see if the mains are better as have seen good reviews here. Perhaps they are more enthusiastic at dinner.
2
Second time here. First time was alright but with only 2 people it was hard to assess if the food was truly good since we couldnt really orser a large variety of food. Second visit was eith a grouo if 5 vety hubgry people. Pros: the food is quite good. No complaints there.Cons: music is too loud. Waiter says that's standard. And we were asked to move to the bar at 745. We sat down at our reserved tables at 6pm as previously booked. Barely managed to finish our dessert with no chance to even consider if we wanted anything else to eat. If i wanted to be rushed through my meal I would go to a food court
4
First time at this well located restaurant at Fairmont Hotel We both shared the barramundi with a side salad and it was excellent. The fish is also served with a side of risotto and clams and is one of the best dishes we have had in Singapore. Staff were bang up to scratch and we enjoyed an excellent meal at reasonable prices.
4
We came for dinner and had two starters, a main and dessert each, which was plenty of food. The tiger prawns and sliders as starters were delicious as were the pavlova and chocolate lava cake. Special mention must go to our waiter, Yi Foln, his friendly service helped make it a very enjoyable night.
3
The food was lovely, but unfortunately ill-timed as the waiter we were assigned was obviously in training and kept forgetting us. We waited over an hour after finishing our starters for the main, and had to ask three times before it became obvious the order had been lost. Someone more experienced kept coming to sort it out but only when very obvious there was an issue. The mixed toilets were filthy. Highlights were the tuna tartare and burrata starters.
4
Went back to Salt tapas after a couple of years still loved the food and wine nothing not to like!
The liquorice dessert is to die for!
Unobtrusive but attentive service
Winner!
4
Very good food!! =)
Lunch set is value for money & very delicious~ Location is very convenient too~ =)
1
Bad service, miserable food. No wonder the place is so bare for weekday lunch. Wouldn't go there again.
4
We came here for tapas just before lunch and the food was absolutely amazing. Unfortunately it was a little expensive which was the only reason I didn't give it an "Excellent" rating.
3
Food lacked depth of flavor, most dishes we tried were bland and dull.
also past visits we remembered more choice on menu including sides and salads which now are not available.
4
And I've had 'em all over Singapore. Good eats, too.However, like a lot of places in Singapore, there is a propensity to offer short measure in drinks, something that I will not tolerate. But, to give the barman his due, he topped off drinks that I pointed out were short.Padron peppers, flatbread board and truffle fries are excellent
3
Had lunch here with a couple of old friends. Ordered buratta cheese and truffle fries to start. They were ok. They have an affordable set lunch at $15-19 . My sliders were pretty bad - barely tasted the beef and what was tasted was burnt or chewy. The tea was some cheap english breakfast. My friends who had the pork rbs weren't impressed eitherMaybe their a la carte or dinner menu is better but i may never knowService is pedastria
4
It was a rare breezy evening in Singapore, when me and my wife visited this bar. We ordered draft beer with Salmon Sashimi and Meredith Valley -goat milk cheese for starters. Both were nice accompaniments to go with the beer. We ordered seared tuna with saffron potatoes for the main course. Beer was cold, food was warm and the evening was enjoyable
4
The tapas calamari my wife and I had was delicious. The "sliders" were not as good. We had a bottle of Chianti which was "house red" quality, a little expensive for what it was, but everything in Singapore seems to be 10%-20% more expensive than in Brisbane [Australia].The indoor/outdoor venue was very good with a comfortable feel to it
4
We went to Salt Tapas and Bar twice during our stay in Singapore, the first time we ordered wine and food and it was a really nice experience, food was good and the staff were great. The second visit was not as good, we did not order food as we were going our for dinner and had just returned from a day exploring, but we had several wines, one of the female staff members had a terrible attitude and we did not go back again, which was really disappointing
5
We came here for the second time. The food is good, the wines are very nice and the staff are attentive. We enjoyed our evening very much and will probably come back next time we are in Singapore.
5
The restaurant is very modern and slick. The Tapas menu doesn't have a lot of variety but the quality of the food was good and staff was very polite and courteous.
For first timers try the wagyu.
5
Stopped by for a light lunch and a couple of refreshing G&T's, relaxed atmosphere, delicious food and great service. Perfect !
4
The food is nice and staff on the ground are friendly,
Quiet and cozy place for gathering and dating
4
very relaxed the food was lovely and the drinks were good the staff were all very nice and Ken was very helpful and friendly nice sitting out in the warm night air having a nice drink and great food. We were staying in the Carlton Hotel and this is just on the opposite corne
4
We enjoyed dining at Luke Mangan's Salt Tapas & Bar. We went for 4 small sharing plates - perfect with a couple of drinks. Service is very fast - too fast in fact so we had to slow them down (as we didn't want to be in and out in 30mins!!!). Food was great - we are a big fan of tapas style eating. We found the serving sizes more than adequate. A good casual dining experience. It was expensive - but hey - that's Singapore for you
3
We had just arrived in Singapore and this wassituTed next to our hotel so for ease decided to try it. We ordered a slider starter to share which was okay followed by a roast shoulder of lamb to share afterwards. The food was okay but there was very little of it. I think it is overpriced for what you get and would not revisit
5
Just across the road from the Carlton Hotel Singapore, a great location with friendly helpful staff, with good menu knowledge. We decided to just have something lighter so stuck with the tapas menu ordering as we went. The food arrived in a timely manner and was delicious. Would definitely go again
4
We left the long bar at the raffles and walked around to find a place to eat.We came across the Salt tapas bar and settled in for the evening. There were four of us. We chose to eat tapas instead of their set Christmas menu.We had salmon sashimi with Russian feta as well as the Jamison iberico. Heaven. Followed by pork ribs and pork sliders. The boys were still hungry so another serve of sliders plus the mushroom parfait was ordered. Everyone had a lovely time.
5
My review was based on my first visit to this place for lunch, and I had a great experience. The service was really good, from the beginning by the usher and throughout the meal. They even explained the recommended menu and best seller, which were not disappointing. The wine was good too. For whom it may concern, it was not crowded and I didn't spot family with children during my lunch so it was a perfect place for meeting
5
Try the cauliflower, it's soooo good.
The barman and the servers are great.
The beer and wine selection are nice, and the atmosphere is grat too.
4
Great Food and drinks
the salmon sashimi is to die for
more outside dining will be greatly appreciated
4
Less pricey than their orchard sister restaurant, i pefer this place for the more casual vibes. Yummy tapas and sangria. Suitable for groups too
4
limited choice that's just right-something for everyone form meat to Spanish fare to asian fusion. drinks value deals galore- chose your time when to go. staff attentive and nice cool atmosphere.Great choice
3
I was at this restaurant in Dec 16. Heard some good reviews and decided to reserve a table in advance to celebrate a colleague's last day in the company. We came and enjoyed the food and services. Although slightly pricey but it's worth the price for a good colleague. But sadly, after our dinner we had expected to be able to have some time to chit chat but we were requested (though politely) to give up our table for waiting guests. Even though there were table of equivalent seats available. This really affected the overall experience grading for the night
4
We’d been here two years before on a visit to Singapore and just had drinks so we were keen to drop in again to try out the food which had looked so tempting on our previous visit.We had a late lunch comprising the charcuterie board (four very tasty meats) and the salt and pepper calamari washed down with 20oz glasses of draught Asahi. All delicious and reasonably priced (the beers were discounted as it was Happy Hour which runs 11:30am to 7pm).The décor is modern and plain with wooden tables and chairs. Stylishly casual.I was hoping to have the Weissbier they had on draught but it was not available. I had tried the Weissbier on a previous late afternoon visit when we’d sat at the bar and really enjoyed it so I was a bit disappointed they had run out this time.The location, right across the street from Raffles and on the edge of the Raffles City mall makes this a convenient spot for recharging after a day of exploring the heart of Singapore.
5
Fantastic little place with wonderful snacks, food and drinks!They have happy hour from 11 am to 7pm, what a bargain! It's across the road from Raffles hotel, and I wish we'd tried it sooner! Went in for drinks but just had to try the Charcuterie which was superb, especially their toasted bread, yummy! Also ordered olives which were absolutely delicious! Never had olives so good before!A great find and will recommend it to everyone
3
We'd walked out of an awful restaurant by the harbour and decided to eat here before getting a Singapore Sling in Raffles Hotel Long Bar. They had a nice range of tapas a few of which could be served gluten free - though not enough. The server was helpful and friendly. My husband enjoyed what he had but even for tapas the portions were small. This place has potential
3
Rating is good rather than averageNice location and reasonable menu options. Selected the Salmon Sashimi which is listed as a house special. Very tasty but on the small side for its SGP$17 price also tried the Prawns at SGP$24 which again were very tasty. I liked this place it seems to have nice indoor and outdoor space and think it is somewhere that would be best if you were in a group and had the chance to sample a wider variety of dishes
4
Went there to celebrate a birthday. The food was on point and very tasty. Raw seafood were very fresh. Quite innovative combination of ingredients. Loved that we made happy hour and had a few glasses of house wine which wasn't too shabby. The service was prompt but very cold and unfriendly. There was not a single smile. Food came out in a timely fashion. The ambiance was great and very romantic.Free wifi available but the password can only be found in the drinks menu. It was overall and enjoyable dinner. Would return with friends
5
A great location opposite Raffles. Sat outside enjoying the cooler evening, great ambience and excellent food and wine. Excellent sevice. Visited twice on recent visit. Definitely going again
4
Brought a visiting friend to have a bottle of wine. Services great and accommodating. The wine we wanted not available but suggested another one which was ok. Just opposite Raffles Hotel. Nice ambience.
5
The tapas is delicious. We had five courses including the potato bravas and ribs. All excellent and the bravas was better than ones we had in Spain. Went last night, going back tonight.
5
The restaurant was hip. Ambience was cool. A great variety of wines. The tapas were well-presented and delicious!
5
Staying in the Fairmont next door, Salt became a regular stop off on the way back to the hotel. Lovely setting with outside and inside tables, very friendly staff and a great place to watch the world go by.
3
Not bad but expensive for what you get. My friends tell me it's not quite up to the standard of its Sydney counter part.
4
This tapas bar is conveniently located near to the famous Raffles Hotel and is also well located to public transport.The service was really good. I had good suggestions from my waiter when I was trying to pair up all of my food and wine which I appreciated. The food was really nicely presented and was delicious. My dessert did not arrive so the waiter apologized profusely when he realized it had not arrived. It then arrived really swiftly and they provided me with a complimentary drink for the inconvenience. That's a nice touch.It is a touch pricey but I thought that it was worth it. Service, Food, atmosphere - it was worth the money
5
Compared to raffles across the road, this was great value for money! They have happy hour from 11.30am - 19.00 pm. Their white wine was extremely good and only 10 Singapore $. We ordered Charcuterie 3 types which was served with delicious grilled sourdough bread! Absolutely divine and their olives are fantastic! I've never tasted olives like these!Our waiter was Jose who was an excellent salesman as we were not planning to have half of what we did and have to say, it was definitely worth it, thank you.It's really worth a visit, so do yourselves a favour and go there
3
Dined here as it was local and easy to visit. Service was very good, food good and drink every expensive. Looks like a place that does well on expense accounts, so, $16 for a pint of beer makes the wine look good value and plenty of choice by the glass! Food choices quite good and our service was very fast. Possibly a 4 star but the drinks prices pulled it down to a 3
4
The food is good, not exceptional and certainly expensive.The service is terrific and very attentive, but $25 for a glass of wine?This is Singapore, so if you don't have unlimited funds, try a food court. I've had far worse food, but also better for what I paid
4
Well situated opposite Raffles had a great little lunch, oysters superb, lovely tapas, and a pavlova to finish. Just enough room to head over to the long bar for a Singapore sling
4
We ate here on a hot Singapore lunchtime and Salt was a good place to get out of the heat. The beer was cold and the food nicely presented and very tasty. Worth a visit.
4
Located in the ground floor of a shopping centre this restaurant is across the road from the famous Raffles hotel. The food we had was all good however as usual in Singapore it was expensive. The cocktails were also quite good.
5
Friendly and attentive staff - great sangria and delicious food! We shared plates - stand outs were the charcuterie and the paella. I would return here in a heart beat!
4
Salt Tapas and Bar has a street location as part of Raffles City Shopping Centre, making it ideal for walk-ins. Robust wooden and metal furniture, Moorish? brick and tile treatments provide atmosphere. Apart from the usual suspects of tapas fare, the menu has some twists that make for interesting dining. Moorish accents enliven familiar tapas and raciones, and excellent oysters are on offer. Most serves come on timber boards, adding a rustic touch. We had a quick but satisfying selection for lunch, washed down with Spanish beer
4
Staying at Raffles for a couple of nights we decided to eat local on the first evening and spotted Salt. The staff were friendly, the selection of tapas was pretty much as expected. The truffled French fries were nicely done but could have done with more Parmesan. The apple cider on the chorizo was a nice touch. Probably my favourite was the pork slider, coupled with a caipirinha cocktail was a very nice intro to the evening. Price is quite high, in London the same amount would have paid for four people instead of two. But then Singapore isn't a budget destination.
3
Salt Tapas & Bar by Luke Mangan was an immediate attraction because it has Tapas and an Australian (Luke Mangan) driving the selections. The reality was that everything was just OK. The selection was - chorizo, breads, olives, potato, fries etc etc. But again nothing special but also nothing bad. I am so glad my friends and I were talking so much it didn't detract from how ok everything was but I think if Iwent there for the food I would have been disappointed
3
Looking for an early dinner to catch an evening flight out of Singapore we thought this would be a good place to eat and get a drink. Drinks ok though pricey which is normal for Singapore but the mediocre quality of the tapas was very disappointing and tasteless.
5
Lunched here with family from Australia and Singapore. The special lunch menu was inexpensive but delicious as was expected from Luke Mangan. Open to the street but cooler than outside. Friendly service.The starters of Parma Ham or roasted pumpkin were perfect. We all had lamb kofta for main and again it was great. This is a standout in the strong competition for the lunch crowd
3
I've eaten here many times and the food is always consistent and impressive. I love the slow cooked octopus and almost all the tapas they offer. I thought the cheese board was expensive and the cocktails were boring, they lacked a certain zing or punch.The service was pretty poor and the restaurant was almost empty, I think it was so quite the staff had relaxed and forgotten about us, pity because it's normally good
2
There tonight with 5 colleagues. Food isn't necessarily bad but it's not great especially for the price. May all look good on a tv show but it's not relating here. Really wanted to work but definitely won't be back.
4
Food was good and delicious. Service was nice. Set meal is Value for money. Worth a visit, especially with friends.
3
Ambience and service is all good . However, it is not value for money as portion are meagre for main course and nothing special about their dishes.
5
Wide choice of dishes for a memorable three course set lunch with pleasant service and pleasing price tag. Most importantly the mussels were fresh.
3
It was their equivalent of happy hour when i rocked up
I ordered a Japanese slipper !!
Looked disgusting
Tasted worse
Still good bar
5
Great 3 course set lunch and good value at $26++pp. The complimentary garlic bread with cheese aioli was a nice touch and delicious. On the revisit list.
5
We visited Salt Tapas as it was recommended on TA. We were not disappointed. The tapas were excellent and our kids enjoyed the prawns so much we had to order another. The signature sangria was delicious. Everything we ordered was very good. The service was excellent and professional. Highly recommende
5
Came here for dinner. The service was prompt, informative and friendly. We shared the prawn tacos and fresh oysters for entree, which were both fresh and tasty. I had the lamb kofta for my main, which was stunning. My partner had the ribs, which were falling off the bone. We also were there during happy hour, which meant that some selected wines, beers and cocktails were $10.
3
It was my first visit to Salt Tapas & Bar. Staffs were generally well-trained and showed very professional manners. Drink list was trendy and wine list was full of goodies. Food was average-good level. But the bill came up with the price more than I expected. Having consider being in Singapore, especially, in the busy area, it is understandable but the value for money was not there. Anyway, it was a good experience and it was full of diners throughout the evening
5
Whilst attending a conference at Raffles City Convention Centre, I escaped the masses rushing for their buffet to this lovely open style restaurant. It looks like it was taken straight out a little village in Spain. Practically attached to Raffles City Shopping Mall overlooking Raffles Hotel on the opposite side. The front of the restaurant is completely open and I enjoyed at a little table on the terrace seeing Singapore in action. A bustling place with lots of local clientele enjoying a wide range of tapas and of course great Spanish wines. I couldn't resist ordering their lunch menu which, for SING$ 26,-, was great value. A nice piece of garlic bread accompanied my starter of Jamon and pickles. Delicious. My main course was a mix of asparagus, beans and other vegetables in a lovely soft white sauce. A small glass of Sauvignon Blanc and I was in Spanish heaven. Highly recommended for lunch or just a drink
3
We had dinner here and ordered 4 different dishes. It was okay, not so special. Some of the tapas were a bit tasteless. So a nice place for some drinks but not impressed with the food. The staff was friendly though.
1
Simply the worst tapas I have ever tasted, and incredibly expensive to boot! A complete rip-off, I have nothing more to say.
5
Very glad we chose to celebrate a special occasion at Salt Tapas. Food was excellent, 4 dishes were more than enough for the two of us. Service was excellent. We were even spoilt with a complimentary dessert to help us celebrate.
4
Have been to Salt Tapas a number of times and it never disappoints. The tapas was great and we shared between 4 . A good selection of wine but they ran out of some options(Tassie Pinot noir).
5
Food excellent. Wine excellent. Service excellent!
The Soft shell crab taco was excellent, as well as the pork sliders. The price is value for money particularly as the service is excellent for Singapore. Well worth the visit.
4
Went there to support the Aussie chef, didn't disappoint. The restaurant is trendy and cosy, service was good. The portion size for tapas a were pretty good, 6 dishes fed 4 adults. Reasonably priced as well. Will recommend to others.
5
After a week of mixed dining experiences Salt Tapas & bar provided a refreshing change. Staff attentive, helpful and friendly guidance of the tapas menu. We tried the foie gras parfait-very good; rosemary flatbread-good; apple cider chorizo; house salad and crispy squid- very good. Overall a nice experience and reasonably priced for dining opposite Raffles
4
We quite enjoyed the food here although I think some of it is a little dearer than would be expected. We have visited this restaurant on both of our trips to Singapore and find it very handy to the hotel we stay at which is in the same complex.They have a small balcony arrangement at the front with a very small area set aside for anyone who wants to smoke. Being outside it is of course hot with traffic noise etc but is often occupied.Most of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and responded well to friendly chat. We stopped in for drinks outside several times and ordered food on a number of those visits.Alcoholic drinks are very expensive everywhere in Singapore & Salt is no exception.We will be back next time we visit Singapore
2
When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by the very standoffish (or basically stuck-up) host who's clearly delusional about what tier her restaurant is, and thereafter, her very unknowledgeable servers. The host had made two interactions: first to seat, and the second for drinks (which we requested for tap water and no alcoholic drink orders). She had made every effort to ignore us thereafter. A terribly rude and unaware woman. I don't expect stellar service at this price point; I expect basic courtesy and respect.When I had asked for a set menu from one of the servers, she told me that they don't serve sets over the weekends. I made a booking for the restaurant after looking over the menus that were available on their website, as well as the booking app's website. Both of which had clearly stated that the set lunch was available daily. Clearly, this was a case of an unscrupulous business who really pushes the limit of "subject to changes".The food, even though I did not get to eat what I was planning to, was decent. I had the pulled pork sliders and truffle fries, which were decent and not expensive. But nothing to rave about whatsoever - it was burger and fries.Would I recommend this place? Personally, I think it's not worth the agony of being subjected to a lack of air-conditioning in this sweltering city and the antics of a very unpleasant host. But if you just want an affordable tapas joint in the city, and you don't care about the experience, then maybe Salt tapas & bar could be for you
5
We saw this restaurant a few times as we passed it at various times of the day, and it was always busy, so we decided we would try it at some point. We were not disappointed, there was a nice buzzy atmosphere and the food was well presented and slightly different from standard tapas food we have had before, much down to the chef/owner Luke Mangan and his team, we had a great time, some other guests waited for a while for their food though we noticed
5
Great place for drinks, dinner, snacks or all together :-) Their sea food is especially good. If you're staying at the Fairmont, where we were I would definitely recommend having dinner here as it's literally just a few steps away.
5
Wonderful place to have a quiet drink and tapas ....very expensive ( in my opinion ) , table service was excellent , and staff very pleasant....very convenient if you are staying the Wonderful Fairmont Hotel
5
Not the first time I have been here and I must say it never disappoints. The food and the wine was great. Service is also great very attentive (not hovering).
4
good food but nothing to shout about
generous portion size
really good and attentive service and recommendations
5
The Salt tapas & bar is a modern and cosy restaurant and bar located at the outside of Raffles City, facing Raffles Hotel.I was there for lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday. As the lunch set includes dessert, I requested the floor manager to add a candle to the dessert. Not only they went out of the way to add a candle (because there was nothing suitable to hold the candle) the servers came by to sing a birthday song.The soft shell crab wrap was superb, and the curried pumpkin was well seasoned. The spatchcock was a average, I was expecting it to be boneless but it came with the small wing and drumstick. Dessert platter consist of 4 items, a macaroon that was not too sweet, a meringue that was soft, a bitter chocolate to neutralise the dessert and an unique pistachio cake which was lightly salted.I would definitely recommend the lunch set. It is value for money
4
I usually don't go fir tapas if I have a choice but this was close to the hotels was staying in and has the Australian connection.Others have comment on how good the service is - I agree.The food was served quickly, reasonable potion size and I really enjoyed the lamb kofta Price ok
5
We called in fairly late on a Sunday after a meeting and although it was within an hour of their closing the experience was perfect. The alfresco outdoor dining tables were perfect creating a perfect experience.The staff were excellent and provided great service which reflects an investment in their training. The drinks appeared soon after ordering and the beer was perfectly chilled plus the red wine was at a perfect temperature.The tapas menu was perfect for us and the food did not disappoint in any aspect with the paella being a taste sensation.With its great location Salt Tapas & Bar is a place to be visited whenever in Singapore for a perfect tapas dining experience
5
Walked out from Raffles hotel and stumbled across Salt, which is owned by an Australian guy from Melbourne. From the moment we walked in.... The service and food were exceptional. I eat a haloumi salad and wanted more then tried the fig salad. Omg both were a taste sensation in your mouth. My husband had crab tacos which he said was stunning. The manager came and checked out good which was nice, the $10 cosmos were yummy as wel
4
Have been a few times with work colleagues and generally it's always a good experience. A little crowded but not too large and noisy to be annoying. Try to get a seat outside as more relaxed and roomy.The menu is small but has a reasonable mix of things best shared. The drinks list is good but wines are the usual expensive Singapore standard
5
We were staying in the Fairmont Hotel right next door and went to Salt for the happy hour drinks. Happy hour actually lasts many hours and the drink prices are excellent. Good quality Australian wine and good beer choices. We snacked on tapas that were very tasty and nicely presented. The service was very friendly and attentive. Great place to sit and while away an afternoon watching the busy city go by. Inexpensive by Singapore tourist prices and good value. Nice atmosphere and great decor. Definitely going back
3
I was excited to go to this place but it was a bit of a let down. The atmosphere was nice, i would definitely go there for drinks as the cocktails were lovely. I would expect the food to be better though. Friendly service :)
2
Although oyster were good, all other food was average. I expected better for the price. Standard tourist trap I suppose.
4
Stopped by while walking to Bugis. Good was good, not exceptional for the price but nothing to complain about. Good, friendly service.
3
My husband booked the place for my Birthday dinner. Its quite the venue if you are around the area, looking for a place to people watch and have a drink. But if you are looking for a date place...AVOID.The seafood paella was very flavorful , infused with the rich goodness of fresh seafood.But the roasted curried pumpkin was a utter disappointment, the pumpkin came in tiny burnt bits with a side of something that taste like ricotta cheese. Zero marks for presentation and taste. Its sad that such a side dishDespite knowing its my birthday, restaurant was oblivious and did not attempt any effort to even offer any greeting. I am NOT requesting "free stuff" but a greeting would be nice. Such acts will determine a repeat visit or otherwise
4
After reading reviews on this restaurant we weren't sure and slightly skeptical, but were very pleasantly surprised. The wine selection is among the best we have seen. The staff was very pleasant, particularly the European lady who we assumed was the manager. The short ribs were cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. Also really liked the beetroot salad starter. Churros had bit too much sugar but we dabbed it off and were also very nice. Would definitely recommend and come back here
5
This restaurant does Tapas and is really good. It is quite pricey but it is worth it. The truffle parmesan fries are delicious and I really look forward to them. They are a must have. Also, the churros dessert was delicious and a great way to finish a meal. I would recommend going there with a small family or as a couple. It is nice to sit and watch the world go by while you eat and the ambience is nice
4
We had a few drinks and sampled two items from their appetisers which were both excellent. The staff was really really friendly. The location is great, perfect for a little bite and a drink after shopping. But I do wish they had more choices on their a la carte menu
4
Fun Tapas bar where you can enjoy a beer or cocktail whilst watching the world go by.Great location opposit Raffles and part of the Raffles City complex, so it's busy and fun to visit.The Tapas are not the traditional Spanish fare Europeans might expect, they are tasty and have a Singapore slant to them.The bar is popular with both the expat and local community.It's a fun and fast place so expect to pay a little more than eating down the road

First time to have dinner hear, the tapas are modern and very tasty enjoyed what we had. The ambiance of the restraint is good but the service is slow. I never got the drink I ordered. Portion sizes are small so don't go to Hungary or it will be a big dent in the wallet. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant.

The food is average at best.. Duck pocket were lacking flavor .. Basically a 16$ curry puff, the soft shell crab were full of mayo, and the chili salt squid was overdone. Tapas should pack flavor that was not the case. The beef cheeks were very good, the grilled barramundi too and the prawn ok. Overall the food is average at best.What saved the day was the service. Very professional, courteous and friendly. The waiter forgot the prawn dish and the manager was really concerned about it. We did not make a fuss but he offered us a complimentary dessert. Not necessary but appreciated. The fact that he truly cared about the delay made us forget this minor issue.Nice setting, not cheap... I won't come back.

Came here for a late lunch on a weekend, found the place very chill. Good service and pretty good food also. We enjoyed the variety and options. Pretty reasonable, will likely come back.
4
good place to chill out , have drinks and have a few bites. relaxing place. staff are attentive. definitely going back especially to enjoy the very tasty paella 👍

We had delicious and varied tapas and dishes today at Salt tapas.
The staff are welcoming, effective , friendly and discreet.
The food was simply wonderful.

This is a good restaurant with a buzzy atmosphere. The choice of food is excellent and the service too. The dishes came as expected and it was a very pleasant experience.

Dropped in for lunch on Mothers Day. Busy restaurant, many families and couples enjoying tapas and other dishes. The variety of meals is very good - from tapas to full dishes.Food quality was respectable but nothing really jumped out as amazing. We ate oysters, truffle and parmesan fries (excellent), soft shell crab tacos (OK but way to saucy with chewy taco shells) and peppered squid (this was excellent). What was delicious was the sangria (Luke Mangan style). Way too easy to drink but a fair cop at $47/jug...Staff could use some training in warmth and good service. A little mechanical and not terribly engaged...It's not a cheap place to eat and the food almost, but not quite, lives up to the price tag. Enjoyable but unremarkable

The Salt tapas & bar is a modern and cosy restaurant and bar located at the outside of Raffles City, facing Raffles Hotel.I was there for lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday. As the lunch set includes dessert, I requested the floor manager to add a candle to the dessert. Not only they went out of the way to add a candle (because there was nothing suitable to hold the candle) the servers came by to sing a birthday song.The soft shell crab wrap was superb, and the curried pumpkin was well seasoned. The spatchcock was a average, I was expecting it to be boneless but it came with the small wing and drumstick. Dessert platter consist of 4 items, a macaroon that was not too sweet, a meringue that was soft, a bitter chocolate to neutralise the dessert and an unique pistachio cake which was lightly salted.I would definitely recommend the lunch set. It is value for money

Salt is on the outside of the mall in a small half open attachment. The restaurant is great. They got friendly staff a small tapas menu with excellent food and plenty of refreshing drinks and cocktails. The clever design lets you sit outside without sweating or sitting in an air con stream of cold air.

Had an uninspiring meal at Salt after not visiting for 3 years. We remember this place being a top quality place with people queing for seats. This is no longer the case and the food was ordinary to say the least. Too many really good dining options in Singapore now to consider a return to Salt. The worst dish was the Paella which was actually OK except tfor a huge dollop of buttery creamy gunk that was splattered all over. WE tried to extricate the gloop from the dish, but it was all over. It is not stated in the menu that it is "dressed" with this gloop, it totally ruined a decent dish
1
We went there on our first night in Singapore - it was late, we wanted something close by and this place had good reviews. We had a good bottle of wine and the worst paella ever. I know, it's not in Singapore that you should expect fantastic Spanish food, but we were too tired to find something more "authentic". And if it's a tapas bar, you would expect them to know how to make a paella? Well they did, except that it came covered in... mayonnaise!!!!When we complained the waiter explained that they put mayo on it because tourists often find the dish too hot.....We went to bed rather hungry that night, but at least the wine was nice..
3
The food is good, ideal if you want something light (the tapas). The service is not great, maybe a few more waiting staff would help.
4
I had a quick meal here tonight which consisted of soft shell crab tacos for entree and beef cheek for main. Both were very nice and the service was good . I would go again .
4
We sat on the outside terrace and had drinks and snacks on a pleasant evening.
The beverages are pricey, but on par for the neighborhood. We loved the meatballs here. Nice cheese selections. Friendly staff!

The Salt Tapas & Bar is located on the ground floor of Raffles City, facing Raffles Hotel, next to the Fairmont's lobby. It is relatively quiet for lunch, which makes it quite a nice place for lunch.The restaurant offers a 3-course set menu as well as an ala-carte menu for lunch. We had the set lunch.The lunch comes with some garlic bread. I selected the mixed board, followed by the grilled sirloin, followed by the house dessert.As the mixed board consists of two types of cured meat, it seemed to cry out for bread. The meat was a little too salty on their own, even with the pickles provided.The steak was good, and served with vegetables and shaved cheese.Dessert was a mix of two macaroons a truffle and a caramel.All for $26+++, it was a great deal
5
My 2nd visit to this bar next to the Fairmont Singapore. Friendly service, excellent music and vibe. Food is excellent and good size portions. They offer light brunch, nibble and meals. View of the Raffles hotel is great and the ambience is second to none. Highly recommend the pork sliders!! Will be returning again.

Normally a big fan of Luke Mangan's establishments but this venue in Singapore was a huge disappointment. Mushy olives, stale bread, Maggie seasoning powdered squid and luke warm white wine (no pun intended). Making it worse was the predatory wait staff that have less charm and personality than the entrance mat fronting our near by hotel. Bloody waste of $100 dollars
4
I usually stop by Salt Tapas at least one evening but have found that they're getting more and more expensive for pretty ordinary fare. Their wines in particular are expensive and low quality - even by Singapore standards. I expected much more from a Luke Mangan restaurant. Questioning whether my loyalty to this establishment is warranted in future
4
We dined here previously, but it has seriously improved. Our waiter was new and keen to impress. We enjoyed the relaxed vibe and the fun of guessing the wine. Food very good, garlic flat bread oozing in garlicky goodness and herbs. Spatchcock with chimicurri corn, finger linkingly delious. All told a great night
5
This is the more casual of Luke Mangan's two restaurants in Singapore and proof that he has nailed good service in a city notorious for patchy service at best and shocking service at worst. His fine diner above Ion is stunning and so too this eatery. A floor well led and clearly a kitchen well led at this tapas joint with stunning view of Raffles and palm trees. Great flat bread. Clever tapas choices. For main.. Great meat platter with sirloin, quail and yummy pork ribs. A side of kale and asparagus as part of it, creamy mash too, all for $64 for two. Interesting wine list. Tremendous value for Singapore, food and wine. Must do
4
We had checked out the menu of the Salt tapas and bar while walking by and thought we'd give it a try. They have an Australian chef and an interesting menu. The food and service are very good but the drink prices a little steep...$14 for a beer. We had a very nice meal of a green salad and paella along with sourdough bread. The paella had a cream sauce around the clams and muscles. The rice was very tasty and the portion was very generous. It was very nicely presented and although it was for two it was more than we could eat.
4
We had a few tapas for lunch, very tasty! Parmasan and truffle fries and the squids were delicious. We also went to the bar for a beer or a mojito (delicious) before going to sleep. Very friendly staff.
4
We were here on a late afternoon and felt not very hungry but need to drink n rest a bit from the heat n humid weather in Singapore. The tapas were delicious and service was good. Love their churros too.
4
Dined here on Sunday for brunch. They serve the usual breakfast dishes like French toasts, scrambled eggs, egg omelette and poached eggs. I ordered French toasts, freshly squeezed juice and cappuccino.The French toast came with one thick slice of buttery brioche bread, topped with one scoop of Okinawa ice cream, clotted cream and jam. The fruitango juice was a nice concoction of freshly squeezed apple, lime, lemon, orange and pineapple. The Lavazza cappuccino was pretty strong and refreshing. Definitely the best way to end a meal. Skipped desserts as the French toast came along with ice cream. The service was good and worth mentioning. They helped me with the stroller and gave my little one color pencils and paper so that she could doodle while we waited for the food to arrive. Overall, the food was good, service was prompt and everything was priced reasonably
5
While returning back to our hotel noticed “Salt tapas’, and decided to a lazy glass of wine and a few tapas. The front of house service was first rate; we were greeted on arrival and shown to a table. First came some cool water and the menus, we ordered our wine by the glass (Australian white) with a view not to have a long lunch. A nice table outside allowed us to people watch as the Singaporeans went about their daily business. We ordered a good selection of tapas and told the waiter just to bring them as they were ready, so we enjoyed a steady stream of yummy food plates for the next half hour or so. This was ideal and allowed us to chat and prepare for what was next, I would recommended the Haloumi Salad , and any of the butcher plates with extra herb bread. When next in Singapore I will be back, just keep my seat for me
4
we have eaten at Salt many times when visiting Singapore as it is convenient to our hotel and I have reviewed before. We are never disappointed but yesterday the food was superb as was the service. We had the lunch special which is 3 courses and the value is excellent. They also have various happy hours etc for drinks which makes it more affordable. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. The flavours of the ribs......sensational. We will keep going back
5
Whilst visiting the city we decided to drop by for some Tapas for dinner. Soft shell crab tacos were excellent and the Parmesan an truffle oil fries rocked. Attentive service and reasonable prices considering the location. The martinis were near perfect for us and the house wine exceptionally good. We would not have the chilli salt squid again as we found it heavy on the chilli. The Jamon was superb and reminded me of Spain. Overall we would go back again and try the rest of the menu.
4
Either outdoors pavement-style watching the world go by, or indoors at table or barside, it would be hard to fault the friendly Aussie style with which the professional waitstaff have obviously been imbued. However over-loud music CAN be faulted anywhere & I doubt the successful conceptual chef Mangan would've approved the sound level inside here..... That was however my only quibble ! The barman made my initial whiskey sour so well I felt compelled to try another (!) & enjoyed two superb Ausralian Coffin Bay freshly-shucked oysters as their accompaniment ..presented with an almost zen sleekness , the clever sauce neither toospicey nor irrelevant . Drinks @ $12 ea + the stunning oysters $6 apiece ... There could be few better venues around town delivering such style with such value. Pity everything in Singapore gets the dreaded ++ cost surcharge >> 10% service charge & 7% Govt tax...in this case $ 34 became $40! I hate that
3
Early evening visit. Lovely food, and service was swift, but we had to ask the staff twice to lower the music, which was too loud for us to talk. It is a chilled out bar-restaurant, not a nightclub and made us want to leave sooner than we would have done. Any music is fine at a level where you can converse but it should not be intrusive
2
We visited Salt Bar on 9th February both at lunch time and for dinner.I was disappointed at lunchtime to see one of the kitchen staff smoking outside in uniform which did not present a good first impression.In the evening the vegetables for our main course arrived 10 minutes before the meat element meaning the vegetables were cold.Very disappointing
4
Had our first 'tapas' ever and absolutely delicious, so too were the beer cold and the missus got a real-mean Mohito :-) Never seen one in jam jar. Don't break your teeth on the edible looking swizzle stick.This place is a good eater, very comfortable with outside and inside seating
3
Went here on the recommendation of the Raffles hotel were our friends were staying as we wanted to have tapas for lunch
The service was good but overall the food was average so can't really recommended considering we paid 250 dollars
3
The Salt Tapas bar was ok but I felt it did not do authentic tapas?
We love going to Spain and the Tapas are Fantastic.
I just felt like there was not much to choose from on the menu
4
limited tables for everyone, super pack after office hours. Draft beer was good cus it was happy hour when I was there. Approx SGD 13 per pint. Truffle fries and snacks was good. Friendly staff, but not all of them are. But very efficient in general. Other than that great location. Located just right outside of raffles place. Great place to catch up, and have a few drinks with friends
4
We enjoyed this place - just across the road from Raffles (where we were staying) especially because the red wine was more reasonably priced than we had found in some other places. When it came to paying I was a bit disappointed that the waiter disappeared with my credit card (having had a card scammed a couple of times recently when I let it out of my sight). All was well though, but I would make the polite suggestion that the resto invests in portable card readers to avoid any future tensions with anxious Brits like me

I visited Salt Tapas last night. I couldn't have left more disappointed. Firstly, I am on business and traveling alone. I was told there were no tables available and I had to sit at the bar. I could SEE the open tables - it was obvious they didn't want to 'waste' a table on one person alone. OK - so I can get over that. I ordered a glass of wine (from the seat at the bar) and actually had to check back 3 times to see if they had actually taken my order. I ordered a salad and an appetizer; they did not ask me if I wanted these served together (which I did) and served them over 30 minutes apart. They never did come back and clean away my empty plates even though I stayed another 30-40 minutes. I asked for the wifi password when I first sat down. The bartender said "yes" and a day later, I still don't have it. When I asked for my bill another 10-15 mins went by with no bill. A waiter even came up to me and said "did you ever get your bill?" I told him "nope!". Lastly, when I paid cash for the bill, the change and the receipt didn't come back to me. I had to ask again - which led to more confusion as they didn't believe I had actually paid. This place is right across from my hotel and I had been looking forward to trying it all week. What a disappointment! It's actually too bad for them....had it been a good experience, I would have brought my entire department over for an event this week. They should remember to treat those that appear to be "alone" as well as they chase after the larger groups!
2
The restaurant looks great but man oh man is it expensive. We paid $60 for a shared steak which could not have been more than 250g and it was not a good quality steak. The service was good but this does not make up for the prices you pay for mediocre food.Very disappointed. Wont return.
5
Found this place near Raffles Hotel. Just managed to be fitted in as it was very busy. Food was excellent and staff attentive and knowledgeable about food/wine match. Not sure about the New Years Eve staff all pouring water over each other as they finished in the kitchen but they all were laughing so maybe it was all in good fun. Made for a great spectacle at the end of the night
4
A very nice setting with a good variety of tapas food and drinks. Very good outdoors and indoors setting. Easy access to Raffles City complex and public rail system of City Hall. Service is good. If you are not a smoker then do not sit outside on the far right hand side corner as just behind it is a common meeting place for employees of the Raffles City businesses to go and have a smoke and you can get up in it depending on the direction of the breeze. Everything else is very good
4
If you're wanting an actual meal, I'd steer away from this place. The food was very good but VERY expensive for what you were given. If you just want a small snack on the run, then it's great for that. We had 2 small Tapas dishes and a bottle of water & it cost us $50
5
i was here recently with my parents, and we had a good time, i had ordered a plate of pate fois gras, which was well made, and there was also some pretty good soup, and a burger of some kind, both of which i had a bit of a taste, and id think of this as the best meal i had in 6 days of my singapore visi
4
Popped in here for a light bite and some drinks at lunch. It wasn't too busy and the service was very prompt. Good selection of light bites. The lunch time special was good value. Overall, a pleasant lunch in a nice environment. Reasonably priced.
4
We had a wonderful lunch at Salt. The food was great and well presented and staff were very attentive. We had an entree and main from the chefs suggestions. Would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good food and a friendly relaxed atmosphere
5
Had lunch before heading off for the airport. An easy way to use up unspent dollars. The food was hot and delicious. The parmesan and truffle fries were very nice. The staff were friendly and helpful. Free wifi.
5
Been here a few times and each visit has been thoroughly enjoyable. I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews as they don't reflect my experiences of Salt at all. The food is packed full of flavour and noisy dishes I've had have been excellent. The service is generally very attentive and friendly too.
5
Was there with a couple of girlfriends twice in the last few weeks after work. Here's what I love about the place.1. Great Wine - I love love the Mcguigan private bin Merlot. It is a very fruity and easy to drink wine. I love reds and this is one of my favorites.2. Allow half bottle of red wine - I can't drink that much but is a pleasant surprise to know that they allow half bottles to be bought.3. Good food - love the paella, sashimi and the soft shell crab!
5
Just recently back from Singapore on vacation and after a long day of sightseeing etc. would stop and have a drink outside at the Salt Tapas & Bar. Service was wonderful and the Beer very cold. Asked if they sold their "Salt Tapas & Bar" T shirts to be told non in stock which was fine however just before we left our server came over and had made a chair out of a champagne cork and wire (which is currently hanging on our Christmas Tree) - Highly recommend this Ba

I've been coming to Singapore on business every couple of weeks this year and often go to Salt because it's next to the hotel that I stay in. Never had a bad meal or service in all that time. Being a lonely business traveler, I sit at the bar where I get fun, educated and attentive service.On the good, the standout for me are the pork ribs; meat falling off of the bone, with home pickled baby onions on top of luxurious creamy mash. Phenomenal. The chicken wings are a winner, the Tuna sashimi with little dots of creamy feta is delicious, tempura prawn tacos are also a hit. All that combined with an extensive wine list, great desserts and homemade ice creams.Couldn't recommend a place more for delicious food to share or eat alone at the bar, in a good atmosphere, served by staff that really care about the restaurant.It's Singapore prices but worth it by far. Go
4
Visited twice for happy hour drinks. Alcohol in Singapore is expensive, so happy hours are welcome and this restaurant is a small, classy venue. They make a very good gin and tonic for $7 each plus service and tax, which are added at virtually all venues. We did not eat but on the bar was a very good looking leg of cured ham
4
Staying nearby, we discovered Salt tapas & bar was conveniently located. Thirsty hour runs from 11:30am to 7pm. By our second visit, the staff already had our drinks ready at the bar, shortly after seating us and without even ordering. Tapas is fabulously tasty and well priced. The salt & chilli squid, as well as the flatbread was particularly good. The drinks are prices a tad on the high side, particularly where other bars offer 1 for 1 drinks (this means buy one, get one free). I will return on my next visit to Singapore.
5
We have been to salt tapas & bar a few times now and we never leave disappointed! Superb food without breaking our pockets! Plus excellent service! Been so addictive to their salt & pepper squid with lime mayo, chorizo, paella, & bbq pork ribs. Their churros are also worth a mention :)
3
Second time eating here on business. Both times I had a selection of tapas. The squid was very good, charcuterie and cheese excellent. Chicken with spice not so much. Staff very friendly and helpful and a nice setting.
4
Great tapas with a great blend of Singaporean/Asian food with European/Australian culinary skills. Daytime menus provide relatively cheap drinks and evenings have wines on special of reasonable quality.
4
The set lunch menu is great value at $34. Innovative menu, well prepared food, super front of house staff- will go back !
5
Enjoyable tapas bar with good service! We shared several small plates and they were all equally good. Nice ambiance and good people watching.
4
Quick lunch and drinks at Salt! Nice simple menu selections. Great drinks selection and happy hour specials! We chose the fish and chips and a paella. Really tasty. Well worth it. Free wifi also a bonus to get a quick download of messages from home. Great service
4
Great food and an excellent tapas menu. It is situated at an excellent position when you're stuck in the hotel nearby and you don't want to be the obvious table for 1. Good for people watching and relaxing while you eat as the world goes by. Good wifi is you want to work and dine too
4
First visit to this Luke Mangan restaurant on our second day in Singapore and it was a pleasant experience. This is located near Suntec mall and was very busy when we arrived. The menu is tapas style so we ordered a few dishes which were very nice but like a lot of tapas you never know if you've ordered enough or too much. The service was attentive, the atmosphere good although it was probably too loud to carry on a normal conversation but it was a Friday night so that was to be expected. There are so many places to eat in Singapore I'm not sure if I'd come back but we enjoyed the evening anyway
3
Me and my Friend only went for a drink, however it was a bit surprising when my Friend ordered a capirinha to taste what I was having earlier and it tasted different, even though when we asked an explanation from the bartender and he insisted of saying that the mix was completely the same. However, I like the caipirinha they're serving its close to the authenticity one
5
What I liked most about the food is that each dish had its own distinct flavor; everything we ordered was delicious. I had booked my reservation online and though we arrived 30 minutes late because we were stuff in traffic, the staff still held our table for us. It could be that it was Monday night and there were still spare tables. We ordered the spiced cashew nuts, eggplant haloumi, tempura prawn taco and the chilli salt and pepper squid. To round that off we ordered the gooey chocolate tart with mango sorbet to share – it was a decadent and fantastic dessert! Highly recommended. We also ordered red wine (a carafe of 500 ml) to accompany our meal. No doubt portions are small but for the quality, it’s a price worth paying. Just remember you’re having tapas, not full-sized meals and if you’re planning on a fun, relaxed night out, this is a great place
4
Decided to stop by while waiting for Singapore GP to start. Staff were VERY BUSY but still friendly. Had 2 beers and 2 cocktails and watched the world go by at the bar. Would have liked to stay for lunch but not enough time. The tapas food looked yummy :
5
Great location and offers air-conditioning to recharge from the outside heat. Food selection was great and thoroughly recommend the prawn tacos. Drink prices were very reasonable and the staff and service could not be faulted. Definitely worth a visit.
4
The bartender Jay is superb. Great cocktails and good starters for a quick bite or a drink session with friends
4
Always love hanging out at Salt Tapas, location is great and the ambiance is nice. The food is nice as well. Price is mid range. Recommended!
5
Have dined at the one on the Gold Coast.
The food here was amazing and we will be back.
Drink prices below average.
Once again the food was amazing.
5
The Fish & chips was very oily & lacked taste. Good mojitos & green salad. The curried roast pumpkin was average. The atmosphere & service are great here :)
1
I went to this Restaurant and Im disapointed the paella was horrible the jamon ibérico horrible and the patatas bravas with chile?? This Restaurant is horrible!!!!! I dont recomended :(
3
The food was quite good, squid in particular, the wine list was lacking a bit, the service was OK however it was expensive and the meal delivered really fast for two entrees and two mains.
5
This is my second visit and I must say it way surpassed my first visit's experience. We had a seat inside the restaurant. The restaurant has been recently refurbished and I must say I loved it. The mood in the restaurant was good. We were promptly served by the servers. Food's cooking time was good. We had been able to enjoy our food warm and fresh. We had ordered the truffle fries, chopped salad, drumletts, paella, bone marrow with bread, oysters and churros. The food's quality was good. We ordered sangria as well. I am also pleasantly delighted that the restaurant offers kid's menu. The servers made us feel very at home. Checking from time to time whether we are good and clearing our plates in a timely and non-intrusive manner. They are very quick to react when asked for service. Thumbs up for the food and service! Definitely a great dining experience and a significant improvement from my first visit.
1
This was undoubtedly one of the worst places we have been to.The food was awful and the service about the sameThe soft shell crab was dripping with oil, the calamari was less than paper thin and was only there I'm sure to give the bread something to stick to. It was also covered in fat.The service was poor and we had to ask three times for our bill. We decided to leave after entrees.The beers were $17 each with all the fantastic places in Singapore To eat this place was awfu
3
The outside seating is cramped and if the breeze is blowing your direction very smoky. The waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable. We were disappointed with the food, presentation is great but taste left us disappointed. We had the bresaola (we felt under seasoned) beetroot ricotta (flavours didn't work for us) , fried potatoes ( just odd), Parmesan polenta ( great texture). The flat bread was yummy as well. The wine list is uninspiring. Our main complaint was that the food comes out far too quickly, we nominated what we wanted for entree and main etc but it was just a flurry of dishes
3
Great service but located adjacent to outdoor smoking areas so not great if you are sitting on the deck. The tapas range was good but some dishes a bit too oily. The range of wines, cocktails and beers excellent.
5
First time trying out this tapas place, I didn't expected much. Me and my friends just walked pass and decided to give it a try.Me and my friends was seated indoor, and we really didn't know what to order. The waiter recommended some dishes to us. Garlic flat bread - Smells so good taste even better ; Bone marrow - Nice texture to the dish ; Grilled mushrooms - Juicy mushrooms ; BBQ pork ribs - THE BEST ! ; Churros - crunchy outside chewy inside ; Chocolate tart - never knew mango and chocolate can be such a nice combination. Mojito - THE BEST ONE IN SINGAPORE !We were really impressed ! All our plates was spotless, we will definitely be coming back again
4
Choice of the tapas was good, not great. But worth 4 stars. Wine selection by the glass was nice. Participated in the mystery wine challenge, where they pour you a glass for $15 and try to guess either the year, vintage or grape variety right - got it wrong as the grape variety was a blend and its hard to guess right. Nevertheless, great fund. Bit on the expensive side, but overall, a nice dinner
3
I cannot deny the fact that I am impressed by the menu in featuring uniquely-described dishes which whetted my appetite just by perusing them. With that being said, I have to admit that when the food came, I was a little disappointed with the portion sizes, especially that of the tacos which I ordered. In my opinion, $6++ per piece of a bite-sized taco was certainly too much for me. Taste wise wasn't exceptional, but sufficiently decent for a somewhat satisfying meal
4
Quite by chance, a friend and I walked past Salt and then I realised what it was and whose tapas bar it was, Mr Mangan from Sydney.On a balmy sultry evening, we sat on an outside table under a fan watching the passing parade.We enjoyed a glass of Albarino and some very delicious shared tapas plates 
4
We had a good tapas meal , even if the highlight was the herb bread.This is not a criticsm , it was a great herb bread. The barramundi was real and the crab was delicious.It is Singapore so it was expensive, but then that it the price of being in Singapore.Even the $75 for a bottle of Ribbonwood Sav Blanc is not expensive in this city
5
My colleague and I sat here for a light dinner after going to the long bar. We ate squid and soft shell crab, both were absolutely divine! The staff were very friendly and quick. We sat outside with a lovely view of the Raffles Hotel. If you visit here I cannot recommend the soft shell crab enough
4
If you are looking for good tapas food in Singapore then I would recommend this, Salt by Luke Mangan. The food is fresh and fantastic. The wait staff very friendly and helpful. good drinks list as well. This is reasonably priced compared to his Skypark Restaurant. Re commend the salt and pepper chilli squid!
3
Food and service did not meet the price point, 4 Bar menu dishes and a glass of cheap bubbles $160 Food okay but not exceptionalLots of staff back of house and front of house, maybe more time focusing on quality than living iff the nam
5
Close to The Fairmont, Raffles and other 5 star hotels is this excellent tapas bar with food by renowned Aussie Chef, Luke Mangan. Excellent service by happy, attentive but not pushy staff..great suggestion of chilli, salt & pepper squid. Very reasonable prices for drinks during happy hour(s)...it goes for half the day! Sit inside or outside, both are lovely and enjoy
5
We returned to Salt after 9 months since last visited. The tapas choices remain large and cover all dietary preferences. Quality and presentation unbeatable. The staff are friendly and interactive. Wine and beverages choices excellent.
Hard to fault and fully recommend.
4
Stopped by for a quick drink and small bite to eat. The house wines are very good and only $9(Singapore dollars) during happy hour. He chopped salad is ok, but the truffle fries are yummy (just need a sauce like aoli with them ).
4
I love the food and atmosphere there. Service staff has excellent attitude and service. Food was good.
4
Efficient & friendly staff.
Had a lovely happy hour.
It's from 1100 to 1900 😄
Black Russian cocktail. Goes well with the Corizo with Sofrito (gourmet sausage with tasty tomato sauce) just the right delicacy for Happy Hour.
5
Early evening meal for 2. It was just across the road from our hotel.
Service was efficient with helpful waiters.
Food was great, we chose the small plates and 4 dishes was enough for the 2 of us.
Nice ambience, Great location.

Second visit & all is still up to scratch. Cold beers & upmarket pub/tapas style food in a high quality eatery. We had the burger & fish & chips & a couple of beers. The food is of high quality & the prices are reasonable - for the location - right opposite Raffles Hotel. A decent casual venue at night too. Recommended
3
Staff are friendly and eager to pour your drinks for you. Most of the dishes came out a little too salty - Paella was nicely cooked, but could do better with more ingredients.Sangria = Fruit Punch.Overall, it's a nice place to chill out with friends

I found this cheerful place by chance after hopping off a City Tour bus. I wanted a cold beer before returning to my hotel. I was made most welcome & was gratified to find that quality beer (e.g. Kirin ) was half the price charged in up market mrket places. I did not order a full meal, but I had a cooked snack which gave me an impression of their cuisine. Regrettably I was unable to return. but I would recommend Salt as worth a visit. It is in the Raffles City Shopping Centre. MRT station Raffles.

Situated directly across the road from the prestigious Raffles Hotel with both inside and outside dining areas. Initially we had planned to just have a drink of Sangria, however as the smell and sight of the food being served surfaced we gave into temptation. We shared Scallops and Spicy Chicken wings, presentation was really good, the taste was delicious, and probably the best Tapas we have had. The staff were very friendly and polite and were quite content to allow us to remain as long as we wanted without pressure to purchase more. Would highly recommended a visit

Close to Raffles and our hotel, it looked inviting, and we love tapas so gave it a try. Very busy so no table outside, but pleasant inside and the service was friendly. We chose well and enjoyed our tapas without breaking the bank. Slightly disconcerting that the waiter took the credit card away to the main till when we paid â€“ but it was o

Been twice with the family and enjoyed it immensely. Jamon, Bone Marrow, Truffle Fries, Chicken Liver mousse, Calamari and lots more.
Great wine selection.
Super service and seating available inside, outside and at the bar.
Great Work

Good for chilling & People Watching. A nice bar opposite Raffles Hotel. Love the outdoor seating area. Friendly staff. Reasonable priced happy hour drinks.

We wanted to try this place out when in Singapore, and we were not dissapointed.Delicious Salty Squids, Chicken liver and foe gras parfait, pork belly snider and we loved thier grilled zucchini salad with pine nuts and pears. Of course we were hungry after a long day. Their food was of high quality and service was excellent, and their portion size was quite reasonable.We loved the atmosphere being very casual; a good chill out place to catch up with your friends or spend time with your Partner. Convenient place, ideal to go for a nibble after walking around or shopping. Drinks and wines are expensive, we paid around S$150 for two people for drinks and tapas. However, we enjoyed their food and drinks, including service. We will return next time.Tip: If you need help with ordering, the waiting staff will help you and let you know if you order too much food

We tried this restaurant in two occasions whilst in Singapore. One was late afternoon and the other was late evening. On both occasions there was good and bad, hence the inconsistent title. Service was always prompt and friendly and the other staff seemed to be having a good time at the venue also.Would definitely recommend the pate, salt and pepper squid was tasty and with a good heat.Sashimi was beautiful. The anchovy tapas was just an open tin of anchovies and dense bread. At the price would have expected fresh. The Tempura Prawns were sweet but the batter was definitely not tempura and should not be called so.A great place to watch the world go by and take a rest from shopping but be careful what you choose to ea

I was recommended by my colleague to this place and was not disappointed. I called to book a table but was told it was fully booked on friday eve and i had to walk in. I tried my luck at online reservation and managed to book a table for four with no problems. We ordered the popular paella which looked kind of small but can actually feed the 4 of us. My dad liked the ribs which was cooked to perfection and was really tender, the meat was falling off the bone and the sauce was really tasty. We ordered the berramudi but personally i found it a bit fishy but my mom liked it well enough. The scallop was well made and i like the prawns with the yummy sauce. We also ordered the parma ham, olives and salad with figs and stuff. Nice meal and nice ambience. Will come back

This restaurant used to be my goto restaurant in Singapore, but in the year or so since my last visit, something has changed, The wines are small overpriced 6 oz glasses at best brought in very small carafes. They still allow you to try a taste before they pour but with such small servings don't expect to be able to determine much. The two whites I had were also served at just below room temperature, much too warm for nice wines. The prices are outageous, $15 to $25 ++. I don't expect to come out of a restaurant paying almost $50 for teo very small glasses of wine. A tapa bar shoud be as much abiut the wine experience as the food itself.I still like the atmosphere, being able to dine al fresco on the street or inside, and the tapas are still vey good. Stay away from the parmesan and truffle fries unless you have two hungry people with you as it comes in a very large bowl and is a meal in itself. Honestly I don't understand why a tapas bar serves somethung so large and call it a "nibble". I was alone and had to send most of mine back. The pork belly sliders are still awesome!So stick with beer and two of the nibbles if alone and you should be fine. I won't return until they change the wine servings

We had been out and about all afternoon and evening. Needed somewhere to eat and came to Salt, tapas bar. We sat outside and watched the world go by while we drank wine and ate tapas. We tried out things that we didn't know alongside things we did know. The food was good, really good and the waiting staff were excellent, very on the ball, very attentive and friendly.Worth a visit
5
We came for dinner on Good Friday without a reservation and there were 7 of us. Thankfully we were accommodated and the waiter that looked after us was fantastic (sorry can't remember his name!) He was also great with our friends 3 children. Yes it's expensive but the food was amazing. Our friends 9 year old was eating the adults food after his kids meal and their 11 year old didn't even bother with the kids menu and ate what the adults did. Exceeded our expectations. Thank you
4
Came here today to try the set lunch which consists of a starter, a main and a side dish for $34++. Dessert is available for an extra $6++ and a cappuccino for an extra $3.50++. We ended up paying about $90 in total for 2 including coffee but no dessert and without extra drinks. I had the tuna sashimi for starter and the pork ribs for main and the truffle parmesan fries as the side dish. Everything was pretty good although the service, whilst enthusiastic, lacked polish (e.g. collecting dishes before the meal was actually finished). Reasonable value for money
2
We visited as Luke Nguyen had his name above the door but this place is no Red Lantern.Food was just ok, service was terrible and way overpriced. We went with our children but the wait staff never offered the kids menu until the sommelier came over and mentioned it. We then were served our 4 tapas dishes before our kids food arrived and we had to ask for them. Even then only one arrived and the other came 10 minutes later. Singapore is renowned for its efficiency but definitely not in their bars and restaurants. Disappointed Luke can't wait to get back to Sydney...

Friendly service, great fusion food and a posh yet cozy ambience makes Salt Tapas and Bar a perfect choice to spend your weekend mornings at.

We have been to salt tapas a few times now and we never leave disappointed!The food is always tasty and the portions are generous. Food and drinks are good value for singapore.Service is always efficient and friendly, and we always feel like valued customers.The atmosphere is always lively and guarantees a good night out
2
The beets entree was ok, I had the ribs for the main, staff took half the orders from our table then disappeared without taking then rest. Then we had to ask them for kids menus as they offered nothing for the kids to eat. Never had that at a restaurants before anywhere.Drinks were ordered when we sat down but didn't arrive until the entree.Proves that it's not enough to put a name above the door, you also need staff with some experience
4
Well on 14th March I was in dire need of a jug of Sangria. I am very elated that it was the same old Sangria that went into a hiatus beginning of the year. I am extremely grateful that the bar manager takes great pride in his mixing of drinks. Thank god! No more bad cherries & missing mint leaves. No more forgetting to adding wine in Sangria. No more getting my orders mixed. Well I guessed they listened. This time around I tried the spicy drumlettes. OMG!! They were awesome. If only the truffle fries can be a little thinner. I am unsure how to convince the chef who seems to like chunky fries. Love the Ortiz anchovies! Good job to Jose & Ambhi who always give me a warm welcome

On our recent visit to Singapore, stumbled over this restaurant & decided to go for dinner before our flight back home. We had a great time. The atmosphere is wonderful with a huge bar. Everything we ordered was superb. Would highly recommend this place & can't wait to return on our next trip to Singapore

My visit to Salt Tapas & Bar was a very pleasant one - with good food, ambience and service. While I had a couple of dishes to try, some of my top favourites of the day were the Prawn Taco, Ham Omelette and Churros with Chocolate. The fried shrimp was succulent and the mild spicy flavour of the chipotle aioli lingers after the first bite. It was a great appetizer to start with, accompanied with other delicious starters - Roasted Garlic Flatbread and Parma Prosciutto. Instead of being baked, the flat bread is grilled which gives a softer and pliable texture. The accompanying dip - romesco, has a mixture of roasted bell pepper, hazelnut and whole peeled tomato cooked together at low heat. Romesco with its mildly sweet and garlick-y flavour pairs brilliantly with the flat bread.Another of my top favourite - the omelette was also so beautifully wrapped up with the best part sealed tightly within the silky smooth egg skin. If only I had such yummy omelettes for breakfast everyday. The Blackmore Wagyu Minute Steak was also an interesting dish as the sides were only cooked for a minute to retain its juiciness and tender texture with medium doneness. With the poached eggs sliced open, the egg yolk made the beef even more fragrant and tasty. We settled with the restaurant’s most popular dessert choice – Churros. I am glad that the taste of cinnamon sugar wasn't too overwhelming. The chantily cream was light, which was a perfect complement with the sweet luscious chocolate.Overall, it was a very satisfying meal for me.

We were in Singapore last month and had the opportunity to dine at Salt tapas & bar. We had one of the best delicious tapas..The service was perfect.. The restaurant has good ambiance and decor . One suggestion... have smokers coded off in a separate area..that way we can enjoy the food to the best
5
We stayed at Swissotel and while strolling one evening we spotted the Salt and Tapas. On the First look we loved it. we decided to have Lunch there and we were 9 people. For Lunch they offered us the set menu which was more than enough and delicious too. They did had Happy hours I guess from 3-6 pm and some drinks at better rates through out the day. The service was quick and we loved the experience.Visiting Salt and Tapas was Perfect decision that made our day and we would like to do that again soon
4
I visited with a girlfriend last night and had a delicious meal. The spiced cashews are divine as is the sashimi. We also tried the pork sliders, zucchini salad and eggplant salad. Great vibrant atmosphere and funky interior. My only comment would be that all the food came at once even after we had asked for nuts and bread first and things to come slowly. We perhaps didn't so justice to the food because of this. Fun night thoug
5
Delicious tapas with a spicy local flare. Great wines and beer to pair with the tapas while sitting outside enjoying a cool night and a gorgeous view of the raffles hotel. The service was beyond perfect with the most polite, knowledgable and respectful service. Midway through my meal someone started smoking behind me and clearly disturbing me and the waitress was so kind to come by and asked me if I'd like to be moved. She offered twice to move me because she could see my discomfort and I thought that was not only kind but very observant and polite of her to even suggest the extra effort it would take to move me and my meal. Great food. Amazing variety. Superb service. Central location. A must try if you are in Singapore and enjoy tapas
5
Visited for a casual dinner and didn't disappoint. Fabulous service and the food was so fresh and flavoursome - thank you!

A good atmospheric tapas bar. Service however was patchy. The order was taken, the food appeared but the glass of wine had to be chased up....Needs to be slicker for the price.
5
This tapas bar was next to our hotels. We popped in for a drink but returned that evening for food. The tapas is amazing. So much more than the usual tiny morsels you get in London. The food is delicious, fragrant and cooked freshly at the bar while you wait. Our vegetarian had fab patatas bravas and garlic flatbread, we had prawns ( huge and delish) and two other dishes and frites - Ken, our funny & friendly server, recommended only 2 portions of frites, as they are huge - the bill was very reasonable, especially after having snacks and wine on the 77th floor of our hotel the night before and I had questioned our bill as I thought we had been double charged for our room!We were surprised how quiet the tapas bar looked, certainly in comparison to the Raffles bar opposite( noisy, hot, and expensive)It was an oasis of calm and relaxation with excellent food cooked with love, in the bustling fantastic Singapore
5
Was sceptical about going here as we had had a not so good experience at the Sky Bar (Luke Manigan) but were pleasantly surprised about the service and the quality of the food. Staff were friendly and helpful and we loved the food. Would go back!
3
We visited on our wedding anniversary, so splashed out on a bottle of bubbly. When it finally (and it took some time) arrived, it was warm. We asked for it to be replaced and it was FINALLY, with a different brand, that was cold, Then when we were presented with the bill, we had been charged for the second bottle (more expensive) we'd been given, rather than the first. No, no - this is all wrong. Whoever thought that was a reasonable thing to do needs some re-training. (We did get the bill corrected - but shouldn't have had to insist.)The service was patchy - after it was ordered, the food appeared very promptly (though ordering took some time) and was excellent. However, for a tapas bar, when ordering for 2, it would be preferable to offer smaller portions so that more dishes could be sampled
4
Located right next to the Fairmont Hotel and opposite Raffles Hotel, Luke Mangan's tapas bar offers cool, refreshing drinks and great tapas meals at an average price for Singapore. They do offer a set menu at lunch which was lovely with an ample amount of food. Definitely worth a visit
3
Perhaps I had high expectations of the bistro, after all it has a person's signature on it.We had a late lunch, just before 2pm and the crowd had thinned out. It was pleasant, at a table outside.The food, on the other hand, was way below our expectations.The main course (pork ribs) was just ok only. The side, garlic bread, was heavy and greasy. The worst of all, were the scoops of ginger and passion fruit sorbet. There was no tinge of ginger at all - just syrup, whilst the passionfruit was all color and no flavor - it was so bad that I was actually angry to see such standard in a highly rated restaurant.When given the feedback, the waiter was disinterested, he merely shrugged and mumbled that 'some people liked our ice cream'. A disappointing experience
5
Had the most amazing night at Salt tapas & bar in Singapore with good friend Dianna Rahman. The food quality was just superb and the atmosphere just electric. Every dish was just mouth watering. I didnt want to leave. Also the wine selection just brilliant. Hats off to you
3
Came here one evening and ordered the squid, beef cheeks, and eggplant to share between two. The beef cheeks were tender and tasty, but I've had much more delicious beef cheeks in other restaurants. Still, they were the best of the three dishes we ordered. The eggplant was nice but the portion was quite small and again, while it was nice it was nothing to rave about. The squid, however was disappointing. Although it was a generous portion, I couldn't get the taste for squid - the pieces were small and I was mostly tasting the seasoned flour used to coat the squid. Would I recommend? No. Not in Singapore when there are so many other options available
2
Now on wednesdays i need a mid week break. My sister & i unwind over a glass or jug of Shirley Sangria. On 7th jan, i was served Luke Mangan Sangria. I told the manager who insisted it was Shirley. Firstly, this drink had no cherries & mint leaves. The manager justified that the cherries were spoilt. Then why do you run a bar? The truffle fries became fatter with no taste of truffle oil. Thankfully on 28th jan, i could taste the truffle oil. The jug & glass were smaller than the usual one since this year. On 28th jan, the bartender forgot to add red wine! The colour was pale!! I didn't realize it but halfway through my drink, i realised that something was amiss. The waiter gave me a free glass for the jug that i ordered. Now, i am a regular at this restaurant. I love the Shirley Sangria, ortiz anchovies& prawn tacos. The waiters know that i am a regular & try their best to convince me to return. I simply adore Jose & Ambi. However, the chef & bartenders disappoint me. I think i am not going to visit Salt tapas for a while. I have wasted $400 in jan 2015.

This is not the best tapas bar in the world (as commented in some of the reviews) however it is one of the best in Singapore boasting an ideal location in the middle of Singapore's downtown. Good wine menu as well. Worth a visit ...
4
Went there for a quick drink, dessert & snacks on a Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere was great.Took a bit of time for the menu and ordering the food. However, for a lazy pm, it's acceptable. The chocolate fondant was perfect with cocoa nibs, hay ice-cream. The truffle fries was ok, it's only fried or added with truffle oil.
5
After a long flight into Singapore and wanting to have a convenient place for dinner, we took a chance on Salt Tapas & Bar. Service was prompt and very friendly, but the experience was so good I ordered the chef, Luke Mangan's cookbook when home again. We loved sitting at the bar for we could watch the bartender and staff put the tapas together. We loved it
3
We were expecting good things from this place. The service was poor considering everywhere else in Singapore is so good. We ordered the prawn tacos (delicious!), patatas bravas (average), salt and pepper squid and garlic bread. Nothing was really stand out. The place was really busy and not worth a visit. There are so many nice places to eat in Singapore-this is not one of them
2
I hate to be too negative when I write reviews, and if anyone thinks I am overboard please look at my history of positive reviews, but salt tapas bar is the uniquely worst restaurant I have ever been to in Singapore. We ordered corona beer, and they had to chill it in a bucket by the table as it was warm. The white wine also needed to be chilled as it was warm. What a joke! The walls are covered with cheap tacky plastic brick and plastic green plants... The waiters were completely clueless and some of the food just sucked. To be fair, the ribs were ok... Nevertheless, I would hate for anyone to think they just have bad staff as that would be unfair. This is a restaurant that clearly has an absentee owner with no interest taking care of his little empire and nobody on site with a clue of how to run a restaurant. The place will be closed within a year. Don't waste your time or money!
4
Our alternative to Brotzeit –see separate review….Prompt and friendly service and more cocktails to choose from than Raffles Long Bar across the road! (and cheaper!) We basically worked our way thru starters and as each was cooked they came out. Didn’t quite manage to eat it all though!! Everything was good!! Truffle and parmesan chips were superb. Pork belly sliders a highlight. Good streetside location for people watching
4
The Main reasons for one less star is the chopped salad in the set menu had too much dressing leaves looked wilted. Sashimi was great and it came with toast. Fish and chips were quite tasty as well. The portion was more than enough for me. It is a tapas, so you can't expect large plates piled with a load of food. The location is in a high-rent district, but the prices are fair for the location. The house Aussie Merlot was tasteful enough for another order. In summary, I can recommend this place. There is a good. Artery of food to satisfy many different tastes
2
Having copies of the chef'sl atest book displayed for purchase and a waiter who suggested the most expensive thing on the menu as the "must try" shouldf already have bee warning enough, but the famous name and the diverse reviews on TripAdviser made my wife and I decide to take the plunge and see what this Australian fusion thing was all about. I'd tried and loved Australian fusion in Melbourne and Sydney when I went there on business, so much so that I was delighted to find a place where my wifge could try it to. Well, Luke should be hanging his head in shame. The squid was so greasy that my wife wouldn't eat it. The cocktails tasted like something they'd serve in Disneyland -- for the kids. I'd comment on more dishes except that I've already forgotten what they were. What was most frustrating was that in just one dish -- the baby beets -- you could see that the root problem in this restaurant is an overextended, absent chef: the beets were beautifully cooked and presented, with contrasts of flavours that enhanced their sweetness. So if one dish could be good, then why were so many so mediocre? Too many of usn have spent our couch potato nights watching Gordon and Joe scolding cefs for slipping up on the details - and here it was happening right in front of our eyes, true to life. I hope that Mr. Mangin reads these reviews -- he should save his restaurants while he still can

We have been wanting to have dinner here for a few months but every time it was fairly booked out. However being midweek we were lucky this week and we got a table pretty fast and ordered a set of tapas with some non alcoholic drinks. The food was super well presented fresh and tasty. The serves were not to large but just right. However once we started to eat lost count on how. Any we ordered and later found out that we were given an order from another table and they were good enough to bring it to our notice but acted more swiftly and offered them free of charge as they made a mistake and since it was Christmas season. Overall $107 for two plus the free dish was well worth it and highly recommend to others
4
There were so many good choices ..Truffle french friesRoasted Pumpkin saladMediterranean salad with Pine nutsChicken etcAnd one can order a Singapore sling cocktail for for less than Raffles hotel which is across the street.Would love to return and try all the many unusual items that are put into their own star chef cookbook.Just FYI, the portions are on the small side
5
Execellent food a great service from jose one of the good staff in salt tapas & bar..keep up the good job guys
Looking forward to coming back soon👍👍 👍

Get the potatoes with dhukka spice. Very unique flavor. Great décor and nice wine specials. Right near the Raffles City mall.

I was at Salt tapas bar few days ago for a dinner with my friends and I have really enjoyed my dinner food was excellent aspecially the taco of tempura prawns w/chipotle aioli and salsa. The service was amazing with freindly waiter and waitress and they also was checking my table very frequently. Overall I didnt missed anything there and definitely I gonna come back with my friends and relatives. Thank you guys
4
Went for lunch with a colleague. They have happy hour prices for the beer at lunch, which was great. The food tasted excellent but if you order a main (not tapas), we found it slightly overpriced for the portion sizes. This place is a little on the "fancy" restaurant side, and it is in a tourist location, so that explains the prices. But again, the food was great
4
We came in out of the inevitable rain and sat at the bar drinking beers and watching a young chef preparing marshmallow cube treats drenched in fine confectioners sugar. Around us some people were eating what looked like delicious Tapas. We had a dinner engagement otherwise we would have been tempted. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We chatted to the chef and were offered samples of the marshmallow treats as we were about to leave. Very yummy. Somewhere worth going back to for sure
3
It is a Tapas and bar locale, adjacent to the Raffles City Shopping Mall and over the road from The Raffles Hotel. Simple tapas share plates, nothing special and ok for a drink and chat with friends. Not a dinner venue, (but better that the Chijmes alternative!
2
I was at Salt Tapas for lunch with my colleagues. While most of them had the set lunch menu, I was not able to order the same as unfortunately, there were no vegetarian options for mains. I ordered only a salad - the Eggplant, haloumi, chickpea, dried tomatoes, herbs, tahini dressing, which sounded interesting and I assumed it would be filling considering it was $16. The portion size was appalling - the dish just about the size of my palm. It was delicious no doubt, but the fact that it was terribly over priced pretty much made it disappointing. I'm not sure I'll go back
4
We spent several times here for both drinks and food. A really good Singapore cuisine style tapas menu, highly professional and engaging bar staff all in a really good atmosphere. The cocktails are well made and the Singapore Sling perfect. it had a really good wine and ales list.A hard place to better for relaxation with excellent food and beverages
3
The tapas portions are a bit too much. We ordered 4 items from the menu1. Oysters, 2. Pork Belly siders, 3. Pamerson & Truffle Fries, 4. Parmesan polenta with poached egg, mushrooms & hazelnutsand we couldn't finish them! Granted, my partner is a lady, but I am not a small eater.The drinks menu is quite extensive, but the signature spanish drink, Sangria, is on the expensive side. We ordered a jug of Shirley's Sangria and it can't even fill 3 cups! But, it does taste great
5
Well, pretty sure I had one of the best dinner items of my life at Salt. We happened upon this restaurant by chance - we were staying at the Pan Pacific and it came highly recommended from the concierge, due to our request for a "laid back" restaurant with a medium price point.The restaurant itself is very comfortable and intimate. The menu had a wide range of options. My friend is vegetarian, and it can be quite difficult for her to find things to her liking at most restaurants. Salt did not disappoint. She ordered the spinach empenadas and an eggplant dish, while I ordered the parmesan polenta and the steak, served with asparagus and this delicious pepper sauce.Here's where my opening statement comes in. Guys. The parmesan polenta - oh my goodness - it is outstanding. Topped with mushrooms in truffle oil and a fried egg...it was decadent. We tried the sangria (both Luke's and Cheryl's, I believe - one had mint and cherries in it), and they were meh. Nothing special, but not terrible. I'd be interested in trying some of the other options, as their drink menu was quite extensive as well.All in all, I highly recommend this place. The price point was reasonable (I mean, hel-lo, you're in Singapore); the most expensive item was the steak, which was around $35. We didn't even finish everything and could have easily fed another two people.Service was fast, but just ok. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Thanks so much for a fantastic dinner - I will definitely be back
5
The tuna sushi is a must. Other favourites were the ribs, the cheese board. Friendly place, great atmosphere. Well priced.
4
As vegetarians it was great to be able to look at the menu and be overwhelmed by the choices. Choosing the beer was easy and necessary as it was thirsty work having to make so many decisions.
5
Always love to visit here when I'm in Singapore. Great food and excellent service from attentive and pleasant staff.
1
Horrible food and terrible service. This has nothing to do with tapas! The chorizo is actually a bad quality bratwurst and the mashed patatoes taste and look like they were eaten and digested once before.
2
I arrive here really looking forward to lingering over a relaxed, delicious dinner tonight. I order a Bloody Mary and sparkling mineral water. Food-wise, I choose Marinated Olives and Sourdough first, then Grilled Barramundi with a Chopped Salad. So ... my Olives arrive, there's plenty - lovely. Then the toasted Sourdough ... a few pieces, good. My Bloody Mary and San Pellegrino arrive too ... very good, now I settle in. I enjoy a few mouthfuls of olives, then my server announces "Chopped Salad!" and presents it to me - I say "no, not yet". He goes away and a more senior waiter appears - "Madam, you ordered the Chopped Salad" - I reply "Yes, I did, but not yet - with the Barramundi please" - he goes away again. I have one more olive ... then my waiter appears proudly with the Salad again and now my Barramundi too. I shake my head - he says, "oh ... you are not ready?" ... um, no - I am not. So away go the dishes again ... all the away to the nearby bar where he leaves them on the bar and disappears. Oh my ... are they going to just sit there until I'm ready? Oh no ... so I must stop what I'm trying to enjoy and take the main course now. The Olives and Sourdough are sitting wasted on my table. I am appalled at this. There seems to be no understanding of timing .. Is it just me? Perhaps I'm the only one who knows that if a diner is still eating something that means they're not finished it, far less ready to have the following course delivered - and I guess is a dream to expect a short pause between courses? For what it's worth, the food was delicious, but good as it was, it will never make amends for the outrageous way it's served - Salt chefs, you really need to know how your servers are wasting all that effort you are putting in. I'm still shaking my head - it was the most expensive half-meal I've ever had. I won't be back and will not recommend this place. No wonder I was the only diner here. Dreadful
2
I'm a great fan of Luke and have been to Glass in Sydney numerous times, Salt in Tokyo and also Salt at Ion in Singapore. However the food and the service at the Raffles City outlet was really disappointing. The plates were funny sizes (neither big nor small), nothing special and overpriced for what you get. Service staff were not knowledgable about the menu. Luke - really disapponting
3
Went there on a weekend night. Most people here complain about service, but we had pretty good service.The problem was with the food. The food could be more authentic and slightly better. It was not bad just not good value for money. The location is good especially if sitting outside. Nice view to enjoy world passing by. Wine selection is extensive but seems so over priced compared to other restaurants. The paella and meat balls were good nothing much to write about others
4
My family and I ate here whilst visiting Singapore following a recommendation from our friends who live there. We were not disappointed. Although we didn't book they managed to squeeze us in a little later giving us time to nip over to Raffles for a "Sling". Service was prompt and efficient, well worth a visit
1
Chorizo should be signature item - not an undercooked supermarket item!I've been here 4 times now and on each occasion the service has been bad. This time the kitchen managed to fail even more.This time the service was really poor - the first guy was friendly but just nodded passively back to me as I placed my order. He didn't write anything down so I I asked him to do so ("to make me feel like you're listening"). This guy needed more training as well, eg:What's the house red wine? Merlot. What type? --Australian. What type of Australian?--Australian red wine.Can I see it on the menu?-- We don't put it on the menuDidn't matter anyway, as the food didn't arrive until I checked (twice) with someone about where it was. When it came, it tasted like an undercooked supermarket sausage. Worst chorizo I have ever tasted - undercooked, undersauced (needed here to hide the taste) and generally bad quality. I'm not expecting Bilbao but come on! ... you would probably get better chorizo in Dapto Diner.Luke Mangan ... again, you've put more energy into your name than into your product or service. So far it's carrying you but eventually a competitor with name AND consistency will step up to the plate.On a nice side ... Manager was very polite and helpful when I complained - but what can he do if the kitchen's process and quality is a mess? A good restaurant should snap him up

Decided to pop in and have a bar snack and drink at Luke Mangan's well known eatery. The food was very pleasant and the alcohol was - well as expected. As we did not have a full menu meal I wont be critical as that would not be objective, but the pork belly sliders and the pumpkin pasta thingie were quite tasty - again I didn' think they were anything too special, but we enjoyed our snack as we sat there alfresco looking over at Raffles. Nice

Spent a lovely late evening at this restaurant,while staying in Singapore for a few days. Close to raffles hotel where we were staying. Tapas was excellent,loads of choice,service very good,would recommend and definitely go again!

Whenever I'm in Singapore I make a point of having lunch here. Excellent food and great wine in an ideal location. Couldn't ask for me.
1
Went to Salt for a light dinner. Had hoped for good things given Luke Mangan's reputation & having wanted to try his restaurant in Bali for many years; however if this was a representation of his culinary expertise, then I'd suggest giving it a miss. The service was adequate but the food was dire. We ordered the patatas bravas which were undercooked & soggy from the lashings of average flavoured sauce, the garden salad was drowned in creamy dressing (which wasn't mentioned on the menu - better to have it on the side as not everyone likes dressing), and the salt & pepper squid which was millimetres thin and deep fried beyond taste or recognition - all you got was an unpleasant mouthful of oily batter - no salt, pepper or squid was discernible. At least the beer was cold to help drown my sorrows. Suggest you keep walking - Maccas is around the corner & it couldn't be any worse for your digestion
3
We have gone to Salt a number of times mainly because it was one of the few places in Singapore that served reasonable champagne.On our most recent visit however we found that they are now serving the sour, very new, over preserved version of champagne that is far too prevalent in Singapore these days, and their prices nearly made me faint. We had booked a table but when we arrived our table was occupied by other diners.Eventually seated, we had the olives/chorizo for starters - very nice. The sea bass/paella for main - excellent. The strawberry dish for dessert - also very nice. Cheese to finish. Seems a lot, but this is tapas (apparently).We had a bottle of the Mumm; First bottle very nice, but the second was undrinkable. It made my eyes water. So we called the waiter over and explained.He said he would tell his manager. After some time we realised that nobody was attending to our complaint. So we called the waiter back and reminded him. He seemed to have forgotten, but then mentioned it to another waiter on duty. They discussed it for a while, but did nothing.So this went on until we found what seemed the be the maître d' and discussed it with him. After a while he brought another bottle out, and changed our glasses. The new bottle of champagne was no better, but not wishing to make a spectacle and ruining our evening we accepted the new bottle. It was making me wince with each sip so after half a glass I abandoned the bottle and ordered a G&T.We left soon after paying a $400+ bill.... never again. The quest for real champagne continues
1
Dropped into salt tapas and bar for a quick bite and have to say we were disappointed.The prawn tacos were alright but somehow the chipotle alioli and pineapple salsa combination didn't quite go together with the tempura prawn.The chorizo "nibble" was a whole sausage which tasted and was very fatty, plain and tasted quite strange.The garlic bread was quite nice but went cold as we were waiting to eat it with the halloumi salad which never arrived... We had asked for it without eggplant which the waiter checked with the chef and said it was ok, however the dish never appeared at all.Upon paying the waiter stood next to me and checked the amount on the receipt and counted the cash (2x $50 bills for a $75 meal). This we found extremely rude and my partner commented on it as he walked away.He must have heard us as he never returned with the change it was sent by somebody else... He also avoided us as we were leaving by dashing indoors.Not a great experience overall very disappointing
1
Would never go back. A potentially nice evening turned sour due to bad service and the restaurants inability to deal with an unfortunate set of circumstances caused by their wait staff. Check your bill because what they say they have covered may well be on your bill to pay

PK & I visited Salt last September during a long layover while in transit back to Australia from Europe. We enjoyed the experience so much during that visit that it was a no brainer for us to return when we found ourselves back in Singapore and staying nearby. Almost 12 months later and we were disappointed to find that the friendly attentive and efficient service we experienced previously had all but disappeared. The staff seemed to have developed skills in looking straight past the customers as though they just were not there.The food, fortunately was just as good as we had remembered it. We shared the Pork Sliders, a very tasty soft polenta with poached egg and Parmesan (although the mushrooms were conspicuous by their absence), a roasted zucchini, pear and rocket salad and braised beef cheeks that were cooked beautifully. Yes prices are expensive, but this is a touristy part of Singapore too, so to be expected. We sat at an outside table on both of our visits, a nice place to perch and watch the world go by, while also enjoying the beautiful Raffles across the road.

While the food was a little expensive the tapas I chose was yummy. I had great service from the waiters which is refreshing after walking around all day. I enjoyed the happy hour prices in the drinks and free wifi is always a super bonus when travelling. Not a bad stop over in this part of town.
1
Very very average .. There was no hint of fine food at all...just the whir of the reheat microwave. Over priced food. Over priced drinks. Only redeeming feature is the lovely staff who try their best
1
It was difficult to enjoy the food because we didn't even get a smile from ANY of the staff: from the guy showing us to our table, the waiter, and the grumpy bartender. I will never come back again. Not even going to bother rating the food
4
Atmosphere, good and tasty food after a tiring day. Great position. Good service. Had several different tapas to share which is a good way to try the different flavours.
4
I've dined here a couple of times now and each time I've been impressed both with the service and the food (and beverages). Staff are always friendly and helpful, and the tapas is excellent. In my most recent trip I tried the chorizo and the rib dishes - the chorizo was very flavoursome and the ribs had a nice little piquant sauce. Try heading there before 7:00pm (early, I know!) for excellent happy hour deals on beverages. Highly recommended, and it's a great place to sit with a drink and a nice meal, watch the world go by with a view of Raffles
3
Late lunch on a Sunday. We ordered 2 happy hour beers but were told happy hour only applied to the outside tables, just a couple of metres away and yes, the same restaurant. We asked a couple of questions regards a couple of dishes but unfortunately the waiter we spoke to (on that occasion) didn't completely understand due to the language barrier. We thought that being a tapas bar created by Aussie, Luke Mangin that English speaking staff would probably be something you'd want. Throughout our meal the kitchen staff were clapping to get the attention of the floor staff both to order and greet customers. Hats off to them but not their job really. We asked for water 3 times and eventually after the god started coming, did water and drinks arrive. The food was the only saving grace with some fresh flavours and interesting combinations. Good sized portions and surprisingly reasonable for Singapore. We would have loved dessert but our table was not cleared after we were done. There was no checking back on food, no sections allocated, no comment upon paying the bill. The gentleman taking our payment actually threw a bill folder, handed to him by a colleague, onto the counter behind him. Perhaps one of the problems when T.V. chefs start a venture in a foreign country and aren't there to watch over them? Go there for the food and DO give them a hard time about giving better service!
4
We are not ones for Tapas food, however on a visit recently to Singapore we just came across this one. We went in at lunch time they have a prix fix menu which was wonderful, we did share some dishes (can't quite remember them) however they were delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the only thing was wine was fairly expensive but this is norm in Singapore, best stay with beer
2
Having tasted many tapas restaurants in Singapore (and Spain), Salt is easily the worst of all. The food quality is just bad. Every item we tried lacked flavours and regrettably, it tasted 'cheap'.Roasted garlic flat bread with romesco and olive tapenade - the bread was good but both sauces are blandPork belly sliders, pickled cucumber & chilli – tasteless, unimpressionableParmesan & truffle fries – like any other truffle friesGerman salami – like any supermarket salamiRoasted garlic mushrooms – small portion, tasteless stir-fried mushroomsEggplant, haloumi, chickpea, dried tomatoes, herbs, tahini dressing – had to double check with the service staff as we couldn’t tell what the dish wasSalt and pepper squid – soggy and tasteless, one of the worst squid tapas I ever hadSumac spiced veal & pork meatballs – meatballs were powdery, texture is way offThe only thing worth mentioning is the service - attentive service staffs and a good manager. However, that’s just not enough for us to return to Salt again
3
The old restaurant in Sydney that I remember was fantastic but this experience let me down. I expected much more I thought the food was ordinary and lacked flavour. The service was good but didn't encourage me to indulge. I love beef cheeks but these needed a serious clutch start. Would I go back, probably not. I felt this disappointment forced me to go to the Tipling club for a nice bottle of wine. Now I am happy 
4
even for tapas, the portions were good for two to share. chicken wings were great. calamari was tasty. cheese (I don't remember which type) was sufficient too.the beer, even during happy hour, was not so much at happy price. but nice and cozy vibe. we were trying to reserve at 7pm but it was full, so we tried walking in at 630pm and no proble
4
Great place and really busy, full of local people after a day at the office! Great choice and good size portions. We had the pork ribs, house salad, eggplant, and potatoes. More than enough for two people, great selection of wine, not overly priced. Really busy for a Wednesday evening.Would recommend if you want food which is different.Would visit again if had the time
4
We stopped off here after a spot of shopping, me, my husband and our 11 year old daughter. The service was good and the ambience was chilled and relaxed. The tapas were great - especially the croquettes with basil mayo, and the jambon iberico was delicious but rather a small portion given the price. Our daughter had the ribs and wasn't disappointed. The wine list was great - a good variety and not too pricey. A great place to revive after a spot of shopping
4
Loved this restaurant with its old world feel and great outdoor seating areas. The buzz inside is cool, very relaxed, nice bar counter and plenty of chatting going on. The food is good to quite good (not very good) I thought it was pricy for the product and some dishes did disapoint a little. Squid was best and fries were served cold!Service was very good. Wine at 90 sing dollars a bottle was the usual sing rip off. Cocktails were better value but lacked a punch and pop you'd expect at 25bucks each.Would I go back, maybe but not fussed
5
Try the Haloumi and chick pea ...fantastic, great friendly service with a varied menu and tasty tapas
3
I stopped here for lunch today. I expected Spanish tapas but on going through the menu found fusion.... influences of the orient and Middle East in their tapas. I decided to sit down and try some anyway.I had a couple of glasses of beer with Marinated olives, a portion of Salt and pepper squid with lime mayo, some Ortiz Anchovies with toast and pico de gallo, and a plate of Barbecued pork ribs. The food was ok. I wish it was authentic Spanish tapas.The restaurant is created by Luke Mangan, a celebrated Australian chef. On this site (Tripadvisor) the cuisine type for this restaurant is listed as Australian not Spanish as tapas should be. If I'd read this maybe I would have gone elsewhere because it wasn't Spanish tapas...

Spotted this restaurant as it was just across Raffles hotel were we are staying. We were attracted by the interesting decor and the constant lively crowd there during lunch and dinner time so we decided to have a pre dinner bites and drinks here. The restaurant has an outdoor section that faces the Raffles hotel and its a great spot to people watch. We didn't have any reservation but the waiter was so kind to show us both the indoor and outdoor sections. We chose the outdoor section to enjoy the view and the lively crowd walking by towards the shopping mall. Being first timers here and really not too familiar with tapas, we ordered a few starters recommeneded by the friendly waiter as well as a bottle of wine which he proposed. The starters were interesting and creative, comining western and asian influencecs. We were happy with the wine selection too. The price was reasonable. Food was good and we appreciated that the staff was knowledgeable with the menu as we were glad with each of his recommendation. Didn't have the chance to try the main course but will certainly be back to try it out when we are back in Singapore
3
The food at Salt Grill & Sky bar at the top of ION Orchard is quite good (but expensive for what it is), and the view is spectacular. Here, prices are reasonable (the set lunch is good value), but there is no view and the food is disappointing - ranging from mediocre to just passable. I wouldn't voluntarily go back
3
We were looking forward to visiting Like Mangan's restaurant but we were a little disappointed. The food was nice but portion size was very small and the service was quite poor. Our meals didn't come together in fact one of our party received hers at least 20 minutes before others that then came out in increments over the next 10 minutes. Worth eating here as the food is good if you feel like something other than a rice dish
4
We were staying at the Fairmont so decided to try this place for a light lunch. The menu seems quite expensive for tapas, but we tried the lunch special for $35.50 and thought that we would probably only just have enough. How wrong! You chose from a short list of starters then a "main" and a side. I chose the prawn tacos (2) which was fairly small but tasty. My husband had the charcuterie plate with jambon and salami, which came with 4 large slices of garlicky bread. Decent sized. We then chose the meatballs (4) on cheesey mash with tomato sauce, which was lovely and the baramundi on baby potatoes with green goddess sauce, accompanied by the mushrooms and a salad. All dishes were very nice, though the mushrooms needed something to jazz them up slightly. We also had a jug of sangria which was very refreshing. All in all a pleasant experience
3
As lovers of Luke Mangan's Glass Restaurant in Sydney we did expect something better than what we received. Lunch of salt and pepper squid was in fact squid rings deep fried thrown on a plate. Not the best taste or presentation.Then the paella came, better presented and tasted quite nice except for the strange addition of a mustard sauce on top. Sorry Luke you need to check on what is going on under your name!A cool looking place though

Salt Tapas & Bar is a spinoff from its flagship, more extravagant branch, Salt Grill and Sky Bar. It is Australian Chef Luke Mangan's first tapas dining concept, located at 252 North Bridge Road #01-22A Raffles City Shopping Centre, Singapore 179103 and the number for reservations is 6837 0995.Salt Tapas & Bar exudes Spanish vibes entwined with the easy ambience of Australian culture providing a fun and vibrant space for friendships to be cultivated and diners to relax. It also serves a wide variety of unpretentious cuisine and wines.We started with Oysters Served Natural, Nam Jim. Instead of the usual lemon and Tabasco sauce, they served the fresh oysters with a light, spicy sauce. The oysters were fresh but we thought them to be a little small. Paired with the unique chilli sauce though, it was utterly delicious.Next, the Salt and Pepper Squid with Lime Mayo - the squid rings are fried to a lovely golden brown shade, and we loved its crispy texture. The best part was that these tiny calamari-style rings did not come with the thick layer of flour. The squid flesh was tender and tasty. It was a delight to pop these into our mouths.After that, we were being served the Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Parfait with Pear Chutney and served with Toasted Brioche. We enjoyed the Parfait because it did not come with a heavy / strong odor; in fact the flavor of birds' innards were subtle, and the paste was scrumptious. We spread it over the crunchy bread slices and topped with the slightly-sourish pear chutney. The combination was a flavor heaven.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/dinner-at-salt-tapas-bar.htm

It may say tapas on the menu but not as you expect. Tonight we had: - scallops prepared well, then spoilt by lemon curd. Doesn't work - kingfish was amazing - veg was heavy, though pumpkin with dukha was great.There is better, but great spot & we'll worth a try
3
We went to Salt with a couple of friends who wanted to give it a try. Previously we had only been as part of large work groups where someone else foots the bill. Salt bar and tapas is fine its one of those places which could pop up in any modern city there nothing particularly Singaporean, spanish or any other nationality about it. The food is nice but definitely not the best tapas we have ever eaten, there is a good selection of wines and champagnes and the deserts looked tempting. Overall it was a good night out with friends but we probably wouldn't rush back or rush to recommend it to others
4
Salt is worth a visit but don't expect big serves. The food is delicious and well thought out I especially liked the prawns in soft tortilla shells with salsa. Don't have wine try the delicious fruity drinks they offer.
3
The idea of an Austrailian Tapas Bar is strange enough without it being in Singapore and normally we wouid not have chosen this restaurant. However friends had been there a couple of weeks before we were there and were very impressed. This coupled with the fact that after a hot day walking around Singapore it was next to our hotel resulted in us giving it a try.The food is tapas but with an asian twist and what we had was very good but I can see why some people may complain about the size of portions. Yes the wine is expensive but it is everywhere in Singapore which why we always drink beer. We had very good service and fortunatly sat outside, the music inside was quite loud, and we could also watch the world go by.A pleasnt meal but not memorable
5
I am not a fan of Tapas but this resteraunt looked so inviting I decided to give it a try.The menu is interesting and there were plenty of options. On the advice of the waiter we selected 4 dishes between two of us and they were ample and delicious. The croquettes were particulalry nice.There was a great selection of wine and we thought the whole meal was reasonable priced.Our waiter was really helpful and very well mannered.We must have enjoyed the evening as we returned again the next evening. Highly recommen
2
the food was edible, but the servings were so tiny, made me laugh. the main courses were tapas size, so I guess that's where the 'tapas' in the name comes from. I think they had a serious shortage of potatoes because I literally had one spoon thinly spread across the platter... and then another dish had mainly salt in the potato, so I guess that's where name 'salt ' came about. No tapas on the menu. finally, all was overpriced, maybe because it was opposite the Raffles hotel, so regardless what we all think of this place, they will always have clients
3
I had dinner here on a Monday night. We walked in without a reservation and were seated right away. The services was good although not outstanding. The decor is neat and tidy however the restaurant lacks atmosphere. The wine list is extensive but the cheapest bottle of wine is $65. We had 5 dishes of tapas which was just enough to fill us up. The food alone was $100. I do not think this restaurant is good value for money. The food was ok Although we had the chicken drumettes which a were dry as was the pork belly in the pork belly sliders. I would not go back to this overpriced restaurant.
4
I ate at Salt twice whilst in Singapore whilst on business, so it can't be too bad! The food is quite good, I just wouldn't call it 'tapas'. It's more a 'small plate' series of dishes, and those that try to be Spanish in orientation really don't work - I tried the churros dessert which was the worst dish I ordered - a hard sugary biscuit rather than churros. The salt and pepper calamari is pretty good, although it is expensive overall as you end up ordering two to four dishes at the same price per dish as entrees and mains at other restaurants. Service levels varied on the second visit - no problems on the first visit, but slow and patchy on the second even though the restaurant wasn't busy
5
+ The first time my husband used the word "excellent" in a restaurant in Singapore. - Small portions - that we were still starving after dinner. Ordered 2 desserts and we were ok. Some dishes though were in a reasonable portion but we have to try a few times to know which ones.- Expensive! Paid 123 SGD for 4 tapas, 2 drinks and 2 desserts.- Noisy. We went there on a Saturday night. I guess it loses the "romance" thing. Reminds me of Spanish restaurants. Noisy. Alive. If you plan to dine there, better reserve a table especially on a weekend or you will end up sitting at the bar which was ok, but not so comfortable for the back
1
My wife and I dined here mid -January this year. We both had a prawn dish which was ok.I asked for 2 glasses of red wine and was served 2- 125mm glasses which cost 44 Singapore dollars i.e. £22 -£11 per glass. Total bill inc. service was 113 dollars and I gave them 120 and eventually had to ask for my change. A total rip -off--- U have been warned!!!!!
3
I wasn't too impressed by this place. My wife and I were just walking around the Raffles City area looking for a place to have dinner, and stopped at Salt because it looked busy and the menu was appealing. We ordered the hummus (OK), croquetas de patatas (very good), patatas bravas (tasteless) and a couple of other dishes that I honestly can't remember (probably not a good sign). We had a generally pleasant meal, but nothing that would entire me to return. The service was good, and the atmosphere was pretty cool, but again -- nothing special. I found the prices very high for the quality and type of food offered
2
Had a meal of tapas and sangria, expecting a Sydney Hilton LM experience. The sangria was pleasant with well balanced flavours and, at about $40, the pitcher yielded 5 or so generous glasses. But we had gone for the food and were very disappointed. Every dish seemed to lack flavour and distinctiveness and those with tomato sauce had a dull bitterness. We won't be back. For food, drink, quality and location, pricey Serenity is a much better bet.
4
We just happened to stumble into this restaurant for a quick lunch. We all ended up ordering the Baramundi and what a nice dish. Very fresh and flavourful. Highly recommend.
5
Went here for dinner, really enjoyed our meal, everything we ordered was great! Service also very good.
Recommended
3
Well nothing bad actually in this place except the price which was over than what we eat. The food quiet "normal", nothing suprise.
Good location, and the place quiet comfortable to spend with friends, please note, if U bring your small kids, totally NOT recommended.
5
Excellent food and service. Try the crayfish burger or paella. Prices mid level affordable, but real value for money .... Don't miss it
4
We have visited the restaurant four times over the past twelve months and have found the food amazing but the service lacking or should I say disinterested. The one man who is interested in looking after you is Matt the exec chef who took control of our menu when we visited in December and again in January. From the freshly cut prosciutto, meatballs, carpaccio, freshly shucked oysters, pork belly sliders, croquettes etc you can't go wrong. A great wine list of Spanish wines very well priced for Singapore the problem we find is that the bar staff are not interested in serving drinks or interacting with guests. On five visits to the bar in the past year ( every time we are in town ) we have found that the bar staff are never welcoming and in a hurry for you to leave. Should take some lessons from the staff at Glass Brasserie Sydney who are always on top of the game

My third visit to Salt. The menu has changed but the food remains good. Miss the tuna sashimi and bone marrow - those were really good. Outstanding tapas this time were the chicken liver and foie gras parfait with pear chutney and toasted brioche ($18), kingfish sashimi with ginger, salad and Persian feta ($21) and churros with chocolate ($14). The chicken liver/foie gras pate came in a little glass jar with 4 slices of toasted brioche. The helping was generous and we had to get a second serving of brioche to finish the pate. The pate was smooth, creamy and rich and we had two servings! The kingfish sashimi had a very delicious dressing and just needed a tiny bit of the Persian feta to complement it. The serving, however, was small and the price prevented us from getting a second helping. The churros were fluffy and crisp and served with a generous share of chocolate and cream.Service was excellent and much better than my previous visit. Our wait staff was attentive and helped keep our glasses filled with sangria and offered to get a extra helping of brioche when we ran out of it. Looking forward to my next visit
5
We went to this tapas bar as we were staying next door and we are australian. We went on a Tuesday when it was crazy hour and happy hour all night. Food was absolutely wonderfully and the staff were really helpfull and lovely. We are going back to singapore shortly and will be going back there
3
My husband and I visited Singapore and stay very near this bar. We arrived at night and decided to go there for a snack.I had read reviews about this bar on Trip Advisor.The bar is located by the street side walk with the door/windows open and music plays. The place is small and it gets very loud. The menu options are good but pricy when comparing with the quality and service. The wine list is small. We still returned just for drinks another night and even though the bar offered happy hour, it was not the usual happy hour, so there was a miss-understanding with the waiter and his attitude was very rude, as he had not explained it in advance
3
Today i went to salt tapas and bar for lunch with my colleague as i thought it would be a nice to place to be since its by luke mangan, but i was so disappointed that i waited for so long just to order 2 cups of coffee and its not the being ask by the waitress/waiter. I have to walk to the bar counter to order it myself. How is this an exception in this salt tapas bar by luke mangan. Totally horrible. This is my first time and facing a horrible service in this tapas bar. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!

Working near Raffles City? Check out the modern Salt Tapas and Bar!Catered for the corporate crowd, Salt Tapas and Bar is extremely convenient near City Hall MRT at the ground floor of Raffles City Shopping Centre.It's not cheap, but the tapas dishes are quite unique, especially the Kingfish sashimi and Grilled Barramundi and squid. A complex taste experience, don't visit if you like it plain. Don't mistake this place for Spanish cuisine, it's not. Is Australian style with more of a Mediterranean and Moroccan influence
4
excellent place for an afternoon cocktail, and a light snack. staff is well trained and very accommodative. fun location across from the raffles hotel with a terrific happy hour, followed by an even better 'crazy' hour...
4
I've always loved the setting of this restaurant. Red bricked with an European vibe to it, even at Alfresco. Service staff was helpful and my boyfriend simply loved the liquorice dessert. Defo worth a visit.
5
My wife and I found this spot on a recent trip. Great spot overlooking street with excellent tapas and service. Drinks prices very reasonable (for Singapore) especially during "crazy hour" from 5-7 pm. Highly recommend.
4
Really love this place. Nice selection of tapas and accompanied by a reasonable wine list. The ambience is pleasing. Staff friendly. As a vegetarian it is sometimes difficult to find food that appeals to me in Singapore but no problems here. I will certainly come back here next time 'I'm in town'
5
We had already been on the go all day and traveled from Koh Samui to Singapore. Time was pushing on and we noticed a lot of the local restaurants were closing. Probably as I hadn’t changed the time on my watch… We found Salt Tapas and bar right outside our hotel door and it seemed a very trendy eatery and was still serving so we went for it.This is quite a trendy hang out and has a tremendous drinks selection including wines. Our server was quick and knowledgeable. We ordered a bottle of wine and a number of Tapas items:All were good in particular the wings and pork belly sliders. We came back another evening for a glass of wine and would recommend both the food and bar
1
The drinks are great but the services really sucks. Even though we asked (raised hand and even going to the server) many times to be serve repeatedly, we were very much ignored. Believed the servers are non local and very lacking in manners (sour face, messy hair and rude answers). Felt as if the restaurant probably owe the servers money and they had no interest to work. The filipino gal is always standing fiddling with the laptop while the other guy keep talking to her. Food in normal and definately not worth paying the cost. One visit is enough
5
Great little bar with attentive staff (every time I walked in my drink was waiting for me at one of the outside tables) with an added bonus of a smoking area. This is hard to find in Singapore as you normally have to stand in the street to smoke. The food is also very good if a little expensive but hey that's Singapore.
3
We had to book to sit at the bar as tables were full. That would have been OK except the small hard timber seats were so uncomfortable. The edge cut into my legs, the back was low. It was not a place to sit and enjoy the ambience. Even if we had been able to book a table, a lot of them were also high, although the seats looked slightly more comfortable. Some were balanced on kegs so diners could not put their legs under but had to turn to the side and the table height was at knee level. We ordered 4 different sorts of tapas which were all very tasty. The service was efficient but not friendly. We are from Australia and know of Luke Mangan but wonder sometimes whether celebrity chef status leads to too many places opened without the chef's quality control
1
I went there for drinks several times and had dinner twice. While I enjoyed Sangria and love the ambience, but the most reccent dining experience on Sept 21 (Sat.) was really unplesant. It was a F1 race night and I sat down before the restaurant got really crowded. There was rarely any staff approaching me to offer any service. For the entire time, I had to raise my hands 6 or 7 times to get someone's attention - asked someone to take my order/ addditional order, asked for water (didn't the staff know to offer water as part of standard service), asked for the bill, asked for the credit card because I just wanted to leave this placce. I did make a point of telling the waiter when I paid the bill that I receievd no service and honestly didn't know why I ought to pay 10% service charge. It wasn't a cheap meal: it ended up at S$60 (or 30 pounds) for a Sangria, a realy small trout and a small plain house salad (an extra, becausee I was still hungry afteer the trout). The restraunt waived the service charge and the waiter explained that they were extremely busy. However, it wasn't too busy when I arrived and when the restaurant wasn't busy the waiters were too busy talking to each other to notice I was waving at them!If you can't provide services, why would you be in a restaurant business? In addition, Salt should know the "consequences" associated with offering tapas only - a greater number of dishes in one order and a lot more work in servicing. There are plenty of dining options in the City Hall area and a lot of better tapas places in Singapore. Therefore, I can't think of any reasons why I should return to Salt in the near future

It was one of those nights when my husband, out of the blues, decided to splurge on European cuisine. After searching some sites and reading the reviews, we settled on this restaurant. Located just next to Raffles City shopping mall, on the same plot of land, is the restaurant. Casual and yet you could sense a touch of class as you enter the place. Very quickly, we were shown to our table. The waitress attending to us was very helpful and she gave great suggestion. We had the tapas with chickpea sauce and it was simply yummy. The flatbread was not too heavy and one order could easily be shared by three people. For mains, we had the specials for the night; salmon pizza, grilled scallops and sirloin done medium-well. Desserts wise was the unresistable churros with chocolate sauce...it is The dessert to die for. It's been a month since my visit and I'm still thinking about it.This is one place worth coming back
5
The food and service was absolutely amazing, highly recommend to visitors staying around that area. Me and my fiancé are looking forward to go back anytime soon.

A spontaneous visit turned out to be a wonderful experience both for the quality of the food and the service. The flavours of all the dishes were incredible and the portions much larger than expected. We will definitely return on our next visit to Singapore.
4
I had a great night here but unfortunately a big group of ladies were having a loud birthday bash - they were loud and noisy, making it hard for me to enjoy my dinner. I had to have the hummus with bread - hummus kinda tasteless but pita bread was good. I ordered a few Mediterranean veg dishes - cauliflower was great but the pumpkin was a so so to me. Nice ambience with a hilarious waiter who keeps coming to our table at the peak of our conversations - he'll come asking how's everything and wants to clear our dishes out fast. Wish they were more generous with the liquor portion as I ordered Baileys on the rocks
4
A busy place is usually a sign of a good restaurant. We walked in and was offered a spot outside. Very pleasant with a bit of a breeze. Service was thoughtful and we ordered beers on tap (limited)Reasonable choice of wine by the glass.The tapas were outstanding - pizza was small but full of taste. Outstanding calamari. Paella was popular. Though we were three hungry men, despite smallish portions we had a very enjoyable evening. Next time I am bringing my spouse as it has great atmosphere and great food - highly recommended
4
It was just by chance that we ended up eating here. The dÃ©cor and restaurant setup we could see from the street was enticing and the tapas style menu was appealing. The menu provided a great choice of food and the specials only added to the choice making it difficult to make a decision. After a lot of deliberating because of the choices on offer, we made our decision and wow was the food good! The service here is good with the staff eager to be of help. A great way to chill out and relax for a while before hitting the streets again
5
It was a family dinner. The food was just amazing. We enjoyed everything from the very start to the very end. Cheakpea oysters, Jambon Iberico, Lamb bresaola and especially Kingfish sashimi (yummmy... my favorite one). As for salads we tried beetroot and house choped salad - very very nice. And for main my son had the chicken which he loved a lot and also we tried paella, a very nice dish with a very strong flavor. Don't forget about dessert - i ordered Churros with chocolate sauce for my son but didn't have a chance even to try it as he finished them very quickly (which means that he definitely liked them:)As for the drinks we tried sangria (very nice and refreshing for a start) and then just a glass of Luke Shiraz was a very good choice to go on.Overall it was a very good expirience, We spent a lovely evening in a good atmosphere with a great food and service.Will definitely come back...
4
Came here for some light dinner. I had the pork sliders and my oh my were they delicious. The atmosphere was also pretty good as was the view across towards Raffles. The cocktails looked nice as well, although of course i didn't try any. Service was pretty good although perhaps lacking a more intimate touch
4
The flavor from the food leaves you wanting more and more. In fact, even after two days, my husband claims that he can taste the flavour-rich tapas in his mouth. For me, the churros with chocolate sauce was something to die for. We had the grilled scallops, the sirloin streak and the salmon pizza as our mains. For appetizer, we had half a dozen oysters soaked in chardonnay sauce and of course the tapas with chickpea sauce. The flavour from each of the dishes was unique and rich. What can I say but this place is worth repeated visits
3
A busy Tapas bar opposite Raffles, and in a popular area. The food is average rather than memorable, and slightly above average pricing though the drinks are reasonable. An enjoyable experience because the atmosphere is good, and better than many others in the area. Inside and outside seating.
5
We booked a table (for 2) here & are glad we did - the place was full & jumping by 8pm.It has pleasant tables outside for drinking with friends and is intimate enough inside to be romantic.There was a great selection of drinks which were good value if you take advantage of the "crazy" hour specials untill 7pm.The food was presented so that you can order tapas sized small plates for sharing (as we did) or the more traditional entre` & main meal sized.We took advantage of one of the chefs suggestions of anchovies on toast & loved the fun way that it was presented with the anchovies still in their tin.The service was fast & the staff pleasant which when combined with the ambiance & good quality food made for a very satisfying dinning experience. Certainly worth a visit when in Singapore - we will go back
4
we came here for a quick meal after arriving in Singapore as we were staying in the hotel. Everything was nice but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
4
We visited with teenage boys in the afternoon. Great friendly service, food was nice, reasonably priced.
3
$38 for a small dish of seafood paella! $40 for a jug of sangria (about 1.5litres). Just as well we weren't that hungry and only ordered 3 dishes. Service was mediocre considering the upmarket prices.
3
We went here because it was close to our hotel and needed an afternoon fix. The food was nothing to rave about, you would be better off going to a hawker centre and trying something new.
4
A great choice of small dishes to share or keep to yourself!
Fairly expensive but we did not feel pressured to leave and enjoyed sampling some different dishes.
5
Being a Luke Mangan fan I was keen to visit Salt. The staff were friendly and even though it was a busy Friday night, they made room for me at the bar and it was not a big deal. The drinks were reasonably priced and the Australian Cocktail was worth it. The tapas were yummy and there was a great choice. The only downfall was the cream out of a can instead of fresh cream that came with the chorros.
2
went there with friend on friday night. when we reach there it was quite busy. had no table but yet no choice to sit at the bar. the bar staffs was friendly and nice. when we want to place our orders. we couldnt find someone attend to us, as we see the bar was busy, and there is no service staffs at all. when we saw a guy wearing blue colour shirt, we seek for his attention, but he did not came to us, he was just aimlessly walking around. the food was alright with some drinks. but it is definitely not a good idea to sit at the bar, the place was so hot and humid, and the spotlight was directly above us, we did not enjoy much as we just want to faster finish our foods and drinks
3
this restaurant was walking distance from our panpacific hotel so we decide to try it one evening. We booked beforehand and chose to sit near the footpath. We have a selection of tapas and while they were okay we didn't feel there was anything spectacular about them. the wait staff were certainly not overenthusiastic and seem to look on it merely as a job to do without any real enthusiasm or show of friendliness.If we were coming back to Singapore, we would probably choose another restaurant. all up with a bottle of wine and a beer came to $200 SGD with the individual tapas meals anywhere between $13-17 SG
4
We had lunch at Salt Tapas & Bar because it was near our hotel and we had two delicious dinners at Luke Mangan's Salt Grill when we visited Surfers Paradise. We are more accustomed to the Salt Grill style of cooking than the Spanish tapas style. We were impressed at the very generous portion of barramundi in the dish of roast barramundi with squid, tomato, and chorizo. We found the salad of beetroot, asparagus and rockets with tarragon dressing to be very tasty. We ordered pork belly with bÃ©arnaise sauce; poached strawberries, basil, white balsamic, and basil sorbet. There was an unusually large portion of meat in the pork belly. They provided free flat bread with garlic and tomato sauce. The ground floor streetside restaurant is open and friendly, and the servers were prompt and helpful. Prices were a bit high
4
We enjoyed a much needed break after our walking and shopping here. The suggested Sangria was very refreshing .. enjoyed it again a few days later when we had dinner as well. The seafood paella was a bit too sticky for my liking but very tasty anyway
5
assorted tapas on lively street across from the Raffles Long Bar is a welcome snack or light dinner. Service was excellent and food was great!
4
It looked very nice from the side walk, decided to walk in and were received with a snooty attitude. We walked out.
4
Great place for a casual relaxed lunch. Good food and great service.
I have been there almost every month and each time I have left happy. Great work guys!
5
We arrived just as kitchen was closing but staff were great and we got some lovely fresh food. All dishes were very tasty and not tiny portions like some tapas. Four kids with us who were all well looked after and churros to die for.
4
Situated in front of the Raffles hotel and just outside the shopping center, this place is absolutely wonderful. Many interesting dishes, served in a tapas-traditionally manner. As it was a hot and humid day we visited, we had cold beers to the dishes, and with Hoeggarden on tap, it’s hard to complain.Some dishes are pretty spicy, but everything tasted great, and in a tavern-setting, it’s a great rest from the Asian foodcourts
4
Went here to kill time when we had about 7 hours between flights at Changi and couldn't stomach the thought of spending that much time at an airport coffe shop. Right off the City Hall subway stop so the the total RT from Changi was under SD$5.00.. Very relaxed atmosphere, nice service, sort of a Singapore styled tapas bar, with equal parts Singapore and traditional tapas recipes. We had the beer and Jamon Iberico (one of the priciest items on the menu, but I was Jonesing for some non-Asian cuisine after a few weeks in Viet Nam and Cambodia. Jamon Iberico is what it is so there isn't much to report. We were a little disappointed that our order wasn't carved off the leg when we ordered it. They "prep" the orders in advance. Later we watched the chef carve a new leg, presumably for orders later that night. Of course it would never happen this way in Madrid where folks take their Jamon much more seriously. Still, it was delicious. We also had the roasted squash salad which was superb. Not a difficult recipe to be sure, but the blend of squash, spices, walnuts and cheese was perfect. A couple of pints of beer each, brought the order to over SD$100. Pricey, but two great appetizers and a few drinks would have cost twice that at Raffles just across the street.The service was just right- they paid attention, AND left us alone. In my experience, that is quite a trick. All in all, a delightful jaunt into the city
3
A small but well chosen menu, food is good and well presented, nice ambience that can make you forget the proximity to roads and people traffic from the shopping centre. However in evening service (after last orders for food) - staff become very focused on preparing to closing up and cleaning around you, which made us feel uncomfortable, finish drinks quickly and leave - only to find out they were open for another 1.5hrs
5
The food was well balanced in flavours and offered a good variety. The staff were well trained, efficient and friendly. I found there was plenty of food when it was brought to the table.....even though the staff warned we may need to order more. I could not fault any dish that we ordered and highly recommend this restaurant
3
I ate here last night 6pm THU. I ate outside at a nice table, fun to people watch. Service was attentive, not overly friendly or warm, food came quick. 1. Taco of tempura prawn, pineapple salsa, chipotle aioli $13. If you get the small, you get two mini soft tacos. I thought the taste was good and light and fresh. 2. Sumac spiced veal & pork meatballs, fontina mash. $14 for a small gets you 3 small meatballs. The fontina mashed potatoes were the star of this one. The meatballs and spicy red sauce were just average. nothing special. 3. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc $15. Bill was $49. This was very pricy for what you received. It was conveniently located, however for that price I would try somewhere else. I'm not familiar with Luke Magnan as he is famous in Australia. But I guess it would be like going to a Bobby Flay or Mario Battali restaurant with higher expectations and being underwhelmed
3
This was my first time at this popular venue. For lunch, you can either select the special set menu, which consists of a choice of three courses out of a limited list (when I went it was SGD 33.50 ++) - or a la carte. To be noted that if you choose the set menu, you do also have choice of a dessert but not on top of it, but as part of the three choices deal.As we were two, I chose the set menu without dessert and my acquaintance instead order paella and fries. We shared the dishes and in my opinion the tapas from the set menu were the tastier, frankly I have had much better paellas. The atmosphere is nice and there is lots of natural light coming in during the day so it is pleasant. It is also conveniently located at Raffles City so just at City Hall MRT and directly across the road from Raffles Hotel. Service was average and cold and aseptic, which I didn't like at all for the money paid.I think it is a slightly pricey and does not offer a fair value for money in terms of overall experience
2
Overpriced even by Singapore standards. Which is tough. Not much choice on the menu.
Overall a poor experience. Not going back. Not recommending.
5
Food excellent. small plates which we like as its so humid...ice cold beer.....we love sitting outside ....
3
Had a dinner with my colleague and clients. I would mark as 65 out of 100 which is not too bad. Food is properly coked but nothing excited which might be down to fact that I am not very keen on tapas anyway.
4
Had a nice glass of sangria. Truffle fries, bone marrow spread with mushroom on bread, fried oysters, pumpkin salad, meatballs. Found the quality of food to be very good and tasty. Nice place to chill out.
4
I had went there on a Friday evening. Situated just opposite Raffles Hotel, near the marina, I hadn't booked but got a place at the bar. It's a very buzzy restaurant and bar, good service in the main, but you could tell as they got busier they struggled to keep up. I started with a cooling glass of the house Prosecco, which was smooth and refreshing. I had the prosciutto to start with followed by marinated lamb, which was totally delicious. The house red, a Spanish Crianza was perfectly acceptable. I ordered a dessert , but sadly waited 25 minutes before I ran out of patience and decided to ask for the bill. I would recommend a visit. The tapas menu is unusual, but then again this is a Luke Mangan restaurant, so expect the unexpected
1
My wife and I went for lunch at this restaurant as a treat whilst on holidays in Singapore! Being Australian we were both excited about visiting lukes restaurant! Our excitement quickly turned into disappointment apon entering! The staff were terrible clearly very inexpierenced. On opening the menu the prices were on par with most "nice" restaurants in Singapore! We orded salt and pepper squid and deep fried prawns, yummy right???? It was terrible, the squid was like a rubber band and the prawns were just awful! We were planning on ordering more but these meals were so bad we didn't bother, those two meals and a drink each set us back $80? Hence why I'm asking are you serious? All in all I wouldn't eat there again if I was provided with complimentary food and drinks! Extemely disappointed!
4
Had the set lunch menu for 33 SGD. 3 dishes of medium size, more innovative than traditional tapas. My choice was tuna tartare, wagyu sausage and roasted pumpkin & pear salad. Food was very good, even though the price for food and drinks is maybe a little high
2
Seriously- Spanish tapas from an Austrailian? Don't think so. "Adds Boy" attempt but only that. Nothing to write my family in Spain about. But what us really memorable is the arrogance and attitude. We actually got a call from the restaurant to remind us of our reservation- or so we thought- but it was actually to inform us prior to arriving that for the privilege of making a reservation we were required to spend a minimum of $70/pax! We would probably have spent it anyway but to call about that?? REALLY?! You have a lot to learn from the real international celebrity chefs- like the value of the customer! Net-net: so so food with pretentious attitude in a local mall. Get over yourself.
3
This is the second time I have been to Salt Tapas since it opened. Had a good meal but not exceptional. Prices were steep & came to almost SGD $100 for myself alone without any alcohol. Ordered: kingfish sashimi, cod croquettes, wagyu sausage & polenta, heirloom tomato salad & chickpea battered oysters.First the good - the signature kingfish sashimi with the cubed feta was excellent & a mainstay of all Luke Mangan's restaurants. The wagyu sausage with the creamy polenta was moreish.The not so memorable - heirloom tomato salad lacked flavor as I suspect the tomatoes were under ripe (for an exceptional version of this dish, Esquina's is hard to beat). The oysters in the chickpea batter were too tiny & didn't really make much of a dent to be honest. The cod croquettes were beautifully presented on a wooden board with artistic smudges of pea puree, which to me overwhelmed the croquettes. A nicer foil was the gribiche sauce that also came with the dish as they were tangy & had bite & perked up the cod in the croquettes immensely.Service was ok but a bit mechanical. I like Luke's restaurants but if you really want to pay this kind of premium, it's better to go to Esquina where I feel the food is more exceptional
4
Love this place and have only frequented it once during a recent visit to Singapore but will definitely return. The restaurant is well situated in the Raffles City complex and has a pleasant rustic decor.Tapas selection is plentiful with some of the more unusual varieties that make this place that bit more authentic. Service is efficient and the staff are well trained on the menu which is priced competitively. We did not order wine but there seemed to be a good selection. It's not a restaurant to lounge in for a very long lunch as the ambience doesn't engender that but as a family lunch or a quick business lunch, it's a must
3
Went there for something to eat and a few drinks, what we got for what we paid was ridiculous, wont be back, left hungry after ordering 3 different tapas, many other places close by to try!
3
Average food and service, food a bit strange for us westerners and like everywhere in Singapore, expensive!
5
WE grabbed a bight to eat as Salt Tapas was right next door to our hotel. Actually the food was very good but snacks and a couple of beers for close to 200.00 Us is a bit much. But you quickly learn that any alcoholic beverages in Singapore are costly
5
Loved the tapas plates,very generous serves,we took the $33.00 Singapore per option,gives choice of three items,great presentation,good vibe,being on the street opposite Raffles and next to the Fairmont Hotel.Six items between two people was more than sufficient,couple that with a cool ale,and you have a wonderful lunch 
3
Dined with friend in 2012. The location is great, outdoor seating, busy road, etc. Across road from Carlton hotel.Plenty of interesting items on the menu and the meals we had were OK, but the service was very ordinary.Untrained staff, couldn't give details of menu items, couldn't get their attention...then kept bothering us and interupting.Meal and drink prices too high.Too mant other great venues in Singapore to worry about trying again. Sorry Luke

For full review: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/01/salt-tapas-bar-by-luke-magan.htmlThe Spanish tapas wave has hit Singapore for some time and Australian Chef Luke Magan, who opened Salt at Ion Orchard, launched his Salt tapas & bar to give his Australian take on Spanish cuisine. The place is headed not by him but by his executive chef Tom Wells, who will still most likely be the one in charge of your food as he was seen around the restaurant that evening.The Traditional Garlic Roasted Flatbread ($6) came highly recommended. The bread topped with grains of salt did not disappoint though the black charred lines contributed bitterness. However the Romesco sauce was mild and tasted like pureed tomato. would prefer violet oon's chilli crab pita though.We also had Salted Cod Croquettes ($20) , Wagyu Sausage,soft polenta,capers and tomato ($14) and desserts. Quantity small but at least you are assured that what goes into your mouth and stomach is good quality food
5
So throughout Singapore Wine is expensive compared to Australian prices, so drinking here will push your bill up $$. My partner and I enjoyed the dishes and flavours here, and I must say the choice of wines was excellent, after drinking Tiger beer for the trip this was a nice change of pace. Recommend the sashimi & squid. Located opposite the Raffles so after our meal we wandered through the historic hotel
3
We had been keen to try this this place during our recent trip to Singapore and went for a late lunch after some hard core shopping. It was obviously not the best time to go as the restaurant was being cleaned for the evening and the staff were partaking in an early dinner. The food was good, but not great and overall a little pricey for Singapore
4
We enjoyed a delicious lunch opting for the set menu which gave us 3 tapas each so 6 in total for $33 p.p. we thought this was plenty of food and lots of variety. Highlights were tuna tartare, arancini balls and calamari. Staff were friendly and provided great insights in menu and what to order. We loved it and will definately be back! Thanks for a great lunch at a very reasonable price! Next time we will save room for sweets!

I'm sure these guys are trying but Salt Tapas Bar really leaves a lot to be desired. The service was slow the night I was there, the food was so-so, and I thought the prices didn't justify the quality of the food. Yes, I'm sure they use quality ingredients but still, the food was quite marked up in my opinion. I've eaten at Mangan's former Salt restaurant in Sydney and this tapas bar is far from what you'd expect of him. He is an Aussie culinary icon! Some of the dishes were fine but nothing really stood out. We paid $6 for spiced cashews that were not even warm. And the serving was paltry. It wasn't that crowded when we went, yet we had to ask the waiter three times to fill up our water and bring us our wine. I thought this place would be a good experience but it was anything but. We sat outside... Most uncomfortable chairs. I hate to say it but I couldn't wait to leave and I'm not going back
5
The tapas were fantastic. There is outside seating and a few of these are set aside for smokers. View across the road is of Raffles
4
For the most part, the ingredients were good and well put together. All dishes are small, as complying more with raciones style than simply tapas, but all dishes are designed to share. So the single size does not a main course make.Wines are good, staff are friendly, smiley & helpful. I reiterate that mostly the ingredients are good. I did not appreciate the meagrely cut salt & pepper calamari, but The beef, Ortiz anchovies, beetroot dishes were really well done.Singapore is an expensive city to eat in. On the scale of things this is not expensive.We ate Ortiz anchovies, heirloom tomato salad, beet root salad with a sublime goats curd, salt & pepper calamari, excellent beef rib eye & two glasses of wine each plus a 500ml bottle of San pellet rink to S$208, inclusive of service charge & taxes. This is Singapore pricing
2
Why a tapas bar in Singapore? Why ridiculous prices for simple tapas fare? Tapas appears to refer to the size of the portions and the general "spanish" flavour to the food without really having a culinary feel for spanish food. There is nothing wrong with the food as it is, but rather than adapting asian flavours to the tapas concept, Mangan has put his own spin on some traditional tapas dishes. Usual accompaniments such as bread and olives are absent. Then again, anchovies are presented "in the can" at about $Sg20. That's not just lazy, it is verging on insulting. Drinks were equally expensive - 1 estrella, 1 glass red and 1 mocktail totalling $Sg40 or so. At $Sg170 for 2 it was a meal that was serviceable but hardly a testament to tapas. It was also far too noisy and conversation was difficult. Why did we go, you may ask? Because it was close to where we were staying
5
My husband have been a couple times to Salt Tapas now because the food and service are consistently good, unlike many places in Singapore. Having lived in Spain before, I wouldn't say it's particularly authentic Spanish tapas (not sure if that's what they're going for anyways) but it's a nice fusion of dishes in a "tapas-style". It is expensive but hey, it's Singapore, unless you eat at a Hawker center you're going to be spending a lot of money in this city. They do a nice lunch special where you get 3 tapas per person and their very yummy bread with romesco sauce to share for I think about $35++ if you just want to try it out. And they make GREAT margaritas which I have been on a hunt for and no one else seems to know how to make
3
Tapas Salt is right on the side of a busy road. If you sit outside you get stared at by passers by and have to inhale traffic fumes. You can see the beautifully lit Raffles across the road, but this does not really make up for it. The service is okay. There was cutlery and glassware missing from our table, and these took ages to come. The menu is short and non red meat eaters may as well go elsewhere. Of the two veggie dishes on the overpriced menu, one apparently veggie dish had "anchovy oil added to it". Why? It did not taste of anchovies and added nothing to the flavour of the pumpkin salad. The very small plates of tapas that we had were tasty and nicely presented, especially the tuna tartare. The food arrived at irregular intervals. With wine it cost well over $100 a head, but, quite honestly, I felt like going for a curry afterwards, as we were all still a bit hungry
5
We had read various reviews but we love tapas so thought we'd give it a try. The service is fantastic. There's a Kiwi guy that works there that is great. The food was excellent, we ordered a couple of dishes at a time and the staff were fine with that. Yes its expensive but the food and wine are outstanding
2
You would expect better from a celebrity chef's restaurant than this rather overpriced, unexciting menu, served with a heap of sullenness and pretension. This particular location has been something of a graveyard for restaurants over the past few years; hopefully the owners can improve the service and menu and avoid a similar fate
3
We specially went to Salt Tapas in Singapore because we were told that it would be great - "it had to be because of the Chef"!What we didn't expect was the cost of our venture. The plate price and portions of tapas were too expensive and too small, respectively. The restaurant was busy and the staff were struggling to cope with the demand. Maybe it was our mistake sitting at the bar, but it enabled us to see the staff struggling with food orders, drink orders and just general customer service. Our food came out quick and the presentation was good and the food was tasty but we didn't expect the portions to be so small. It also came out so quick our drink hadnt made it yet. If you are after a quick lunch then it will be quickly delivered and will taste good, it is just that it might be a quick expensive meal.

I went to Salt tapas & bar last night after work. I had walked past it several times and thought it looked extremely nice. We were 3 people and ordered a pumpkin salad, truffles fries and some proscuitto to share. The 2 girls I was with had water and I had a glass of red wine. The salad was minute (12 SGD), the truffles fries average and the proscuitto barely even touched the sides. Even the glass of red wine was a tiny serving. When I spoke to the manager about the small portions and and inflated prices he seemed disinterested and said "sorry, but this is tapas". Correct me if I'm wrong but is tapas another word for 'minute portions at inflated prices'. We were all bitterly disappointed and will not be going back. I left starving. I'm a regular to Singapore's new foodie hangouts and this place was a real letdown. To be honest I think the only reason why this place was relatively busy was because of it's location. There's a lot of footfall from hungry tourists who most probably pop in here with the same intention we had, never to return. The service staff were pleasant but clueless. Next time it's back to the tried and tested Wine Connection in Robertson Quay. A great selection of wine at economical prices and good food served in a dynamic atmosphere. You never leave hungry or with the feeling you've been fleeced by a concept hiding behind the supposed trappings of a 'trendy tapas bar' meaning you'll get portions fit for a hamster at silly prices. Shame. Never to return. Dominic Lamber

First time visitor to Luke Mangan's Salt Tapas and Bar at Raflles City and it defintely won't be the last...Great tasting food, good wine and friendly service combined to make it a very good first time evening dining experience. This is tapas with that Luke Mangan twist! I agree that the garlic flatbread is great but the tempura prawn tacos are incredible the egg gribiche is amazing. The win by the glass is limited but the tempranilo was a fine match for the food. Be warned (and I was by the GM), once you order the tapas platters will arrive at a pace. One thing I noticed was the food came out in order of increasing intensity of flavour. It was great and I have no idea if it was intentional but given the whole experience I suppose it was! Finally, the atmosphere is relaxed and the tunes provide a good background vibe...enjoy
5
Food was nice and the ambience was very cozy. A first dining experience for me in Singapore. Food quality was good although the wine menu was indeed limited. But all in all, this was a good chill out place especially for couples.
5
Found salt tapas while we were walking around city hall, good food, good drinks, service ok, hope to get back soon
5
I frequent Salt Tapas for lunch several times per month and I just love the place. I had another excellent meal there again last Saturday.We always ask for a table outside where we can enjoy views of the historic Raffles Hotel. They have an excellent drinks menu including Little Creatures bright ale (from Freemantle) and very reasonably priced Spanish tempranillos.I pretty much order the same things because they are just so damn good: marinated olives, grilled chorizo, lamb bresaola, tomato & feta salad, and anchovies on toast (the latter is simply divine).See you again soon
1
Had:Salt and pepper wings - dry and tastelessSalmon - ordinary. About 4 pieces for $19!Wagyu sausages - forgettable Bread - ordinaryParma ham - ordinary. Can get the same in supermarkets. Overall expensive and food bordering on bad. In fact the wings were really bad! Would not go again nor recommend it to anyone.
5
Located at Raffles City, this modern hip tapas bar has great food, a large drink list (although not many wines by the glass) and they will sign you on to their wireless if you ask. I loved the garlic flatbread and the pork and sumac flavoured meatballs, but the salt and pepper wings were not my taste.This is a hip young crowd and a popular spot but they let you linger for as long as you like. There is a patio and an indoor seating area (still open to the outside but with ac to cut the humidity).The wines while limited by the glass are interesting, so I can live with that but a few more choices would be nice. Prompt, efficient and friendly service and a must dining spot in the Raffles hotel area as the prices are reasonable
3
Stopped in for a small lunch before the F1 Grand Prix, was seated quickly and my drink arrived in a flash. Some spiced cashews were put down in front of me as I looked at the menu not realising that these were NOT complimentary nibbles. I chose salt & pepper chicken wings, took a little while to arrive and when it did I was presented with tiny and very overlooked wings. Service was average to poor, I was beginning to appreciate why it wasn't that busy on one of the busiest Saturdays of the year - then I got the check (a gratuity had already automatically been added but still they left you a line to add a further tip - I think not), just over of US$50 for wings and 2 draft beers, oh and the nuts! I'll pass on by this place next time and I suggest you do the same
3
After spending 4 days in Singapore at the end of our holiday to Italy we wanted our last night to be special and I'm sorry to say we were disappointed with salt tapas and bar. Not sure of really what to order as haven't been to this particular tapas place before we ordered two courses each. We also had a jug of sangria. The sangria is wonderful there are a few choices of sangria -very nice. Was still ravenous after our courses. It would have been nice if someone was available to ask if we were just there for a snack or were we after dinner-for if your after dinner we obviously ordered the wrong dishes. We then ordered fries with Parmesan - this was a generous portion. But overall a disappointment - for us anyway
4
*I know it's a tapas bar, but the portions were still relatively small. Surprisingly though it didn't take much food to satiate my hunger. The food quality was good, the wine menu a bit limited. Outside seating is by a busy road, although you don't notice it much. A good place and worth a visit if you fancy this when you are in Singapore

We'd had a previous disappointing start to our evening with another restaurant, so you know what it's like when you have to start hunting for food again. The welcome at Salt was professional, warm and friendly. The only seats available were at the bar, to keep it cool the fans were ar full blast, but the waitstaff had no difficulty in offering to turn them down or even off for a while. Wine was a bit expensive, but worth it, it was served promptly and our first round of tapas arrived soon afterwards. The anchovies in the can with garlic toast were to die for, so were the white anchovies. The meatbalss were very tasty, the fires the best we have had to date in Singapore, we managed to moved to a table outside which was very comfortable. Difficult choice for dessert....my partner really enjoyed the Chocolate Fondant with vanilla icecream, whilst I was more daring and switchedback to savoury and ordered oysters! Why not? I was well rewarded, they were superb, I am a big oyster fan. Even though the restaurant was exceptionally busy, the staff really had their work cut out, the service was excellent. Definitely will go back again, I think it will become a firm favourite in Singapore

This place is possibly our favourite place in Singapore. We sat at the bar were entertained by this girl call ^^ Shirley^^ . She recommend us to try her drink"s ( Shirley"s Sangria) and some tapas. Our favourites are chorizo , beef, taco prawn really great tapas. I must say Wonderful Sangria! Great service . We would probably try to go again when we back here.

Salt Tapas was next to my hotel when travelling for business and how lucky am I!!?? Great laid back atmosphere with decent food... AND... free wifi better than the hotel. Seating outside here is very comfortable and far enough off the road to be settled whilst remaining in the action. Directly across from the Raffles so taking in a bit of culture is easy. Hoegaarden on tap and great meat dishes like meatballs, salami, parfait (personal favourite)... all tasty and quick. Couldn't ask for more. Just be aware that this is standard Singapore $$$ so don't expect a bargain

Visited lunch at Luke Mangan Salt Tapas .The menu is interesting value for money . I would say worth for a try , nice Sangria . But the service not up to standard , service staff here work like zombie , you have to raise hand up high in the sky then they will notice you .if not they just stand there stoning . They look so sad like the world owe them money . Should not work in the F&B industry. The service here is as bad as last time Double Bay Restaurant .??????Lack of Management SKill ?????

What a great find! We came in on a busy Friday and they offered us a table on the terrace, facing the Raffles hotel! started with Lukes Sangria. After that, we had some delicious sliced hams and a flat bread. We ordered more dishes like the wagyu sausage and some roasted pumpkin salad. The ambiance of Salt is great; nice Spanish music as well. We ended our night with, I think it was the chefs special, custard tart, recommended by the charming and friendly lady from the service. We would surely come back

Arrange with friends to meet at Salt Tapas on Thursday night for drinks. We were excited to go to a celebrity Luke Mangan restaurant in Singapore. We arrive and wait for 10 minutes to get a table. The tables was OK at the outdoors area. However we would have loved tohave a few drinks. We could not seem to flag down a wait staff to ask. By the time got someone to pay attention , one of my friends have to go the bar ask the barmaid whether we get our order from the bar or get a server to take our order. She is so friendly and ask we to sit down faster ask a server to take our order.We love the Singapore Sling wanted to have another drinks but its seem that no one around us to take order and the same barmaid notice us , she calling one of the server to take our order.We feel that such a nice good restaurant and nice atmosphere place should look into the service standard. maybe Mr Luke should hired a professional manager to run the place if not the other guest like us won't be back to the place.Hope the next visit to Salt will be better when we are back to Singapore

Had lunch here Saturday 2pm. Fairly quiet. Good menu well structured and fairly good value. Had the pumpkin salad, the trout and the meatballs.Pumpkin with pear was delicious - highly recommend !! Trout was ok, could have been better, bit bland, needs some lemon or something else. Meatballs were delicious with the mash. Drank a couple of Bloody Marys, only reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is because it was an average drink. ALWAYS serve celery with your Bloody Mary!! It's just lazy not to!!Maybe me just being fussy but I'd definitely recommend the food here, nice to get good tapas on Asia

Must be honest and say that the title is a comment that my wife made when we ate here recently. Just bumped into the place when we came out of a meeting in a nearby hotel. Pleasantly surprised would be something of an understatement. Couldn't fault the food, in fact it was without doubt the best tapas that we'd ever experienced and we've tried it in many places. Half a dozen dishes did the trick, each was pretty unique with a clever combination of ingredients and flavours. We were gratefully talked into trying an excellent dessert too. The waitress was all smiles and generally did her employer proud. The house wine wasn't half bad which was just as well since the wine list wasn't exactly defensibly priced! A great experience and we'll do it again soon doubtless

we stumbled across Salt as we were staying nearby and wanted a late lunch .Enjoyed the food, truffle chips, Wagyu sausage , rocket salad and meatballs (venison i think ).Staff were't quite as knowledgeable as they should have been, a waitress (who hadn't served us brought a serving of meat balls to my husband and I .luckily i realized after i had cut one of them that it was an arancini ball that one of our friends had ordered .Not good enough for the price we paid.overall we loved the taste of all the dishes we tried.Would go back again

For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog at www.ms-skinnyfat.comWe headed down to Australian celebrity chef Luke Mangan's Salt Tapas & Bar at Raffles City Shopping Centre for our catch up session. Luke is also behind the Salt Grill at Ion Orchard (which has an awesome view) but Salt tapas definitely has a more relaxed atmosphere. The mix of warm lights, raw brick walls, Spanish tiles and wooden table tops radiates a laid-back ambience. We decided to sit at the alfresco section where we had a barrel for a tabletop and high stools for our bums. That gave us a good view of the Raffles hotel minus all that Cityhall crowd. The food is an Australian style tapas with Middle Eastern and North African influence. There are only a few dishes reminded us of Spanish tapas e.g. Chorizo and Iberico ham. That was pretty fine with us since our main course was in fact the sangria and the food was just to prep our tummies for the drinking ahead. :)For starters, we had the Oyster in chickpea cumin batter and tzatziki ($5 each). I must say that the oysters are really puny. I could hardly taste much of it but the chickpea tempura batter was light and buttery. The tzatziki at the end was refreshing even though the taste was a little bland. We kinda like this but wished it the oysters were bigger.We also had the truffle fries which were a miss ($10). Could hardly taste the truffle oil and the fries were soggy after a while. I must say PS cafe still has one of the better shoestring truffle fries. The Coastal Settlement also has yummy truffle fries.Tapas- Soft shell prawns with chilli and garlic aioli ($15). Crispy fried shrimps tossed with a salt and spice mix, Chinese Canto style. Perfect savory snack to go with beer or in our case, sangria. I'm usually uncomfortable about eating the entire prawn with head and all but these were crispy enough to eat and the meat were still juicy. The aioli dip is a tad heavy and kinda masks the taste of the prawns but it's nice if you just add a dash.We love the chewy, sinewy texture of the BBQ spiced beef tongue with fried cauliflower, pistachio tabbouleh and harissa yogurt ($14). Tongue can be kinda iffy but trust me you will fall in love after eating it. The chewy texture is kinda like pig's liver (another iffy thingy) but liver is a little more powdery. This is chunky, moist and somewhat tender. This dish is definitely Moroccan inspired. Love the mix of pistachio tabbouleh with the yogurt but the sourish cream kinda overpowers the meat. The pistachio tabbouleh reminded me of my favorite Walnut cake at Pasha (read about it here). Nevertheless, it's definitely a healthier substitute for mayonnaise. Really interesting dish.More meat coming your way. The Wagyu sausage with soft polenta, capers and tomato ($14 for a small portion- 1 sausage; $25 for large portion) is well seasoned and tender. Did i mention super juicy as well? I love the use of polenta as a replacement for mash because it isn't too very starchy or heavy; it has a light powdery style that is slightly grainy.The highlight of the night was obviously the Sangria! How can you do Ladies' night without drinks right? The economists in us decided to go for the Punch Bowl ($70) because 2 glasses per pax ($17/glass) would already cover the cost of the Bowl. That was despite knowing that we could never ever finish it. 4 freaking litres of Sangria! I had 5 glasses and Z another 4 and it was still half full/half empty. Ethan (or was it Ian?) offered us free drinks in replacement of the unfinished drinks the next time we head back. How nice. The servers were so patient with us despite us holding them back from closing. Must have the Luke's very own Sangria concoction. This is definitely our happy juice. Sangria Challenge accepted! Must finish the entire bowl next time. Despite being stuffed and all, we still needed desserts to conclude our meal. Gooey Hot Chocolate Tart with Caramelized Banana and Salted Caramel Ice Cream ($14) was our choice and i would say their desserts are not that impressive. The chocolate wasn't dark/dense enough and i found it too sweet. The tart was bland too. I am almost certain that quality chocolate isn't used. :/ The ice cream was way too salty! I was literally eating salt flakes. Not the best execution. Verdict- Recommended
