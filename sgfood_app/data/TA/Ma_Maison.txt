Came here with a family, ordered three food for 4 people. Hamburger steak, bolonasaie spagetti, donkattu all items I ordered are awesome,got a free beer as a family promotion. Cannot expect more out of this price range

Like the cosy atmosphere, and good food. Service was prompt too. My favorite dish is the squid ink pasta, always so good.
5
Awesome! The best katsu in Singapore.
Would highly recommend it.
The quality is unrivaled and their are many choices even for vegans.
4
A very good restaurant. It has a good selection of Japanese food and the service is very very good. A definite good choice for lunch, either business or personal.
3
The service is great, the ambience is cosy but the food is unexpectedly, average. Perhaps my expectation was a little high. I ordered the beef rice which was way too salty.
5
What a surprise to find this gem of a restaurant. After being normally disappointed in the food and service in Singapore, this place was an absolute great find. The staff was not only great and helpful, but the food was equally wonderful. To top it off, I was happy with the price; wasn't expensive for what I received. The atmosphere was also very unique. I will go back again for sure

Ma Maison serves excellent food and wine in the best tradition of European hospitality. Attentive, polite service with the service staff calling out in the Japanese way to welcome you when you arrive and to thank you when you leave. Spaghetti and steaks, escargots and chowder are found alongside tonkatsu and omu rice. Quaint brass key instead of your check adds to the charm
5
This restaurant is very crowded and had a long queue outside during dinner time. We queue for a while and we get a table. The decor is nice, English decoration and playing of oldies in the background. The dim lighting and candle light at the table make the restaurant feel very romantic. We have ordered a hamburger steak with foie gras, a Ma Maison speical pasta and mixed fruit tart. The Japanese waitress and cashier is super friendly and polite, can speak good english and dishes actually served quite fast although with all the crowds. The foie gras is good, hamburger steak not saltish and with with the sauce taste delicious. The special pasta is unique and the fruit tarts is great and fruits are fresh & sweet as well. Highly recommended to visit
5
My friend said Ma Maison was for good tonkatsu which we could also get at Chijmes, so why go to Ma Maison @ Bugis? Well, this restaurant offers great Japanese style Western food like hamburger steak, spaghetti at cheap prices for their set lunch. If you still want tonkatsu they have that too.

This is one of My favorite rstn.Came here with a friend and ordered1. Escargot Was slightly off standard. At times they can made it very nice. Do always order some toast or garlic bread to eat with the melted butter and garlic2. French onion soupAll time favourite. But at times can be on the salty side3. Stir fried pastaThink this is the stir fried version of the usual carbonara version. Interesting but would still prefer the original version.4. Poached eggExtremely filling and it was done tastefully5. Mango cakeReal mango, nice cream, not too sweet. Happy ending
3
A little out of the way in terms of location but a nice place to eat if you're in the area. The staff were great. The food was nice but not exactly what I was expecting. Still, I didn't go hungry.
5
The Taste is great, so much like the tonkatsu in Japan. I also like the taste of condiment sauce. Even the price is higher then in Japan. I reccomend this place for authentic Tonkatsu.
4
Since it's Friday, so I don't mind joining the queue but have to wait for approximately 30mins or so, before you can get a table.We ordered omu rice though it's Super yummy but it's kind of pricy as well and portion is small.The restaurant has a delightful ambience.Staff provides excellence service, cheerful and welcoming.Would recommend all to give this is try if you like Japanese food

I was always curious about this place, but the menu never attracted me. This time one of my girlfriends wanted to come here as she is a fan of their escargot and gratin foods. Again, the menu didn't impress. Additionally, they removed the gratin pizzas that she had intended to eat. lol Their "specialty" hamburger patties served with a measly couple of wedges and vegetables are basically what I eat at home very often. The beef stroganoff had more canned mushrooms than beef pieces, and the sauce tastes like the british instant meat sauce. We also had the deep fried camembert which was good, and the escargots which were fine - also nothing to hop about. Ambiance wise was dark and intentionally homely with that rustic feel - which would've been nicer if the waitstaff weren't screaming welcome in Japanese from all ends of the restaurant whilst we were eating. Service wise was fine, I liked that they were quite intuitive about the water. Overall I highly doubt I would come back as I'm not usually keen to pay restaurant price for food I can easily make better at home.
5
For us vegetarians, it was always difficult to find food in Singapore.The food court at Victoria Street, Bugis Junction is full of restaurants of different cuisines but we were not able to find tasty vegetarian food.Ma Masion gave us an option to prepare food according to our needs. The pasta and pizza were tasty. The staff was very courteous and the ambiance was nice.Worth visiting again!
4
Not too bad. Gave us a table for 6 when we only need 2. Service is generally well. Apparently it seemed like the table cloth hasn't been wash for quite a while,which felt damp and gave off a musky smell. Overall the atmosphere is kinda like a cottage / vintage style
4
Ma Maison offers a wide range of meals that possess a Japanese twist with Western influence. I have been here three times at least and I would highly recommend their cheese fritters. Each serving contains 5 pieces so it can be shared by 2 people at the most (but it's really good so you might want one plate for yourself even if it's just an appetizer). The sea bass was good, the burger steak with cheese was also nice. Try to come early as the place quickly fills up and there is always a queue
5
This is an AMAZING what seems like a little restaurant at the corner in the Bugis Junction shopping mall. I was browsing for a nice place to get some escargot fix for myself and abit of a rest after shopping for hours.Quickly browsing through the internet, I was lucky enough to came to this restaurant.My first impression: such a cute little shop. That ended until I stepped into the dining area. The atmosphere was perfect and fun decor all around. It was family-friendly, and it feels like a fine dining place.I love a good escargot and we ended up ordering another set after finishing the first set in a jiffy! So my family agreed with me that the escargots were excellent.Next up: The Beef Stroganoff = Soft & Tender beef, just WOWWe also had the strawberry shortcake for dessert, it was really good! Do not leave without having the shortcake.On that note, the service was excellent. The staffs friendly and fun. I was there on a weekend and it was packed 4/5 of the whole restaurant. Overall waiting time was real short. We had our food come to us after 10 minutes into our order

Comparing the mass market Japanese dining options available in Bugis Junction, it is no wonder Ma Maison is a favorite with Japanese expats and locals. The familiar dishes are still tasty and affordably priced.Haven't visited this original branch since it opened some 20 years and was glad to find signature dishes from the old menu. I still remember the female Japanese chef stir frying Italian pasta. The country-style decor and table setting remained familiar. We decided on the onion gratin soup, pork tonkatsu, seasonal wafu spaghetti and strawberry mousse tart for dinner. We didn't have to wait long before food arrived.The sticky and stringy cheese covered a cupful of steamy soup with soft onions. The al dente spaghetti was well coated with a creamy sauce of sliced mushrooms and pork. However I was not a fan of the taste profile mixed with fresh silver fish.The tonkatsu was a thick slab of pork dressed in a crispy bread crumb coat. It was technically well executed but the juiciness of the pork and crunchiness of the crumbs could take leaf out of Tonkichi's page in Shaw Centre. The strawberry mousse tart was a blue ribbon winner. The slight acid from the fresh and large strawberries balanced the light sweetness from the soft mousse and crunchy base. Nothing fancy in appearance but a well executed pastry that leaves you wanting more
4
Went to Ma Maison with colleagues. Ordered a Hamburg Set. The taste fits well with my preferences. Portion is reasonable but price is a little bit on the high end. But it won't stop me from coming back. The settings and environment is quite unique. Worth to try at least once
3
My friend brought me there and i instantly fell in love with the cosy ambience! The food is yummy! Pork tonkatsu is so delicious.
3
I like their pork tonkatsu. Reasonably priced and nice, although no where compared to those I ate in Japan.
Still ok.
4
The lunch set is worth the money. Quality is great and the portion is reasonable. Different taste from the usual common Japanese food in bugis. Only thing is the coffee taste watery.
4
Have visited this place many times and it has not failed my expectations thus far. The set lunch's food portions are always generous as it always managed to fill me to the brim...total satisfaction
5
Am at the Restaurent, staff here are energetic and efficient. Thoughtful to every thing that u ask for. Excellent place for lunch and dinner. Family get to have nice ice cream and toy for ur kids :)
5
A lady staff was very attentive to my child's safety despite the crowded place. She checked with me if l allowed my son to go toilet in case he gets lost. Was very proactive when l feedback about member stamp.
4
I especially liked the omelet rice containing brown sauce that's stewed for days. eggs r fluffy and flavorful brown sauce fully complements the dish
4
The food was good and the service was not too bad. Ma maison has always serve nice and good food. Another satisfying experience
4
Ordered the famous and highly recommended Steak hamburger, and it was simply divine. The brown sauce compliments the succulent and well-marinated meat.
Excellent!
4
Food - Ma Maisonâ€™s set lunch comes with soup, salad, rice/bread and a drink. There are different options for the set lunch - Western, Japanese and their famous Hamburger Steak. I opted for their famous Hamburger Steak and this did not disappoint. There was a sunny-side egg on top and the meat was juicy and flavourful. I took the bread option which was good to mop up the eggy goodness with the beefy brown sauce.Ambience - Very interesting furnishings. Cosy wooden furnishings. Definately a place that I will be going back to soon
4
ordered the hamburger steak and it was simply divine. The brown sauce that's simmered for days brings out the flavour of the steak. will definitely go back again!
5
Excellent food and ambience at pocket friendly prices. Bring your date there for a Japanese version of French cuisine
4
Serving a good selection of Japanese Western food with good value set meals, their quaint decor and polite staff (most are fluent in Japanese) provides an unforgettable dining experience in a homely atmosphere.
5
I've lived in Japan, and one of the varieties of Japanese food that i love the most is youshoku, or Japanese-style Western food. It's hard to find authentic, competent youshoku specialist restaurants outside Japan because it's not a very well-known cuisine and people might just wonder- why not go to an actual Western restaurant?But it's different. And i'm glad that Ma Maison exists because i can rely on it to satisfy my craving for youshoku every so often. There's a Japanese chef, service lives up to Japanese standards, and the restaurant's decor is impeccably homely.I'm so glad it enjoys brisk business because i would hate for it to ever close down. :
4
The moment I enter this restaurant, it gives me a very cosy feeling. From the tablecloth to the window, I sort of felt like in another country. I ordered a sirloin steak and it was pretty good. The potato side were really tasty. This is kind of a western-japanese fusion restaurant. Price was pretty reasonable
5
Visited a few days ago for a late lunch around 2pm+ and the lunch crowd had dispersed. Fortunately, the set lunches will serve until 3pm so hubby and I each ordered a set lunch at $13.90++. For this price, the set included salad, soup, mains and a drink which I personally thought is quite value-for-money. Initially, we thought maybe the portion might be smaller given the prices but they were all of quite a decent portion and could definitely feed an average adult well. Most importantly, all the dishes were well-done and very tasty, from the soup to our mains which were curry rice and sirloin steak. I don't usually eat steak but i would say it tasted really good to me. Their grape tart is also very nice though it is a little expensive as a dessert. Their service was friendly and welcoming too. Would certainly go back for their affordable lunch sets
4
The escargot is very yummy, like melting in my mouth Also, Paella taste is really nice with a lot of seafood. Usually I don't like tart because it's too sweet. This time since I haven't finished catching up with my buddy, so we order the desert mango tart & mixed fruits tart. The tart is nice, not too sweet. The waitres also are friendly
4
Had Ma Maison for lunch. Ordered the Hamburger Set, portion is reasonable - price a bit on the steep side for the type of menu. This little gem is tucked deep inside Bugis Junction and could've easily missed. The settings is quite unique - staff was friendly. The orders came relatively quick. The downside is limited seats. Otherwise, I would recommend this place.
4
Seats are quite limited in this restaurant. It's tucked in a corner of Bugis Junction. It's good for family meals as the settings are quite homely. Service was prompt and food were quite up to standard. They even serve set lunch on a PH thus it made the cost quite reasonable. Remarkable... Hope to see more themed-dish to be added to the menu. Check-out was out of the norm...the waiter will pass you a key..hmm
4
Our first impression of the restaurant was the ambiance resembles the French Bistro that we have dined in Osaka, with a cosy and rustic decor. Though seems small the interior is quite well planned and spacious, but be prepared to stay in line for up to 30 mins on a Friday evening. Most of the wait staffs appear to be Japanese and as usual very courteous and efficient in service.The Seafood Paella (for 2 to share) comes with a generous serving of rice, prawns, squid rings, clams and mussels. The rice was well cooked, moist but not sticky. The Chasoba Salad was more of a soba dish than salad with a light touch of saltiness in the seasoning but well balanced off by a small amount of mayonnaise dotting the dish. The strawberry tart was very popular but the staff will reserve for you if ordered with the main dishes. The strawberries was quite sour but the tart itself was very sweet which again balanced off when taken together.Overall it was a good meal at an affordable price for a Japanese western restaurant in Singapore
4
Nice japanese restaurant that serves authentic tonkatsu, ramen and gyoza. Good place to dine in if you are looking for nice Japanese cuisine.
5
This is one of fave restaurants in Bugis area with good quality french- Japanese fusion food for a slightly above average price. It's hard to get seats for a group unless you're early. I've been caught waiting up to 45 mins for group seatings and they may not take last minute reservations. Got there on a recent Friday at 210pm for a late lunch by myself and thankfully they were emptying out. I was shown straight to a sit down table as per my request. Otherwise you could opt for a bar top seat but I don't like the cooking fumes around me. I ordered a clam chowder and a squid ink spaghetti. As usual I can't find fault with the food. Service was fair as I had to wave my hand a few times to ask for water refill. Cost for one came up to almost SGD $30 after 17% taxes(10% service charge+ 7%GST). I'm already a regular so I'm biased obviously. And no, I'm not paid to advertise for them

i. Went in a table of four to the one in Bugis Junction. o Excellent environment. Truly a fusion of Japanese and the Western style. o Free WiFio Delicious food, you'd definitely come back. o Great service! The young lad put on a great smile that brightens up your dining experience when you're being served. Keep it up!o Food came out from the kitchen quickly. ii. Chicken with Garlic sauce was well put together. You will get the familiar taste of the chicken with the aromatic, mild garlic sauce. The roasted potatoes were a little surprise to your dish buried underneath the main character of your dish, chicken. Great presentation, absolutely appetizing. 3.5/5. iii. Cuttlefish Ink Spaghetti was a nostalgia to my family while we were in Venice. Let's start with the presentation: simple decoration that suggests "I'm better appreciated if I am eaten." So it is, the smooth slurp that allows your spaghetti to slide between your lips and into your tongue is an orgasmic experience made possible by the chef. The expectation was on the high side as the comparison was to that we have tasted magically in Venice which was creamier and smoother. With that comparison, this one tasted drier. Overall rating 4/5. iv. Tonkatsu Set was the fancy one of all with a separate tray of sweet sauce for pork chop, Japanese salad dressing, salt. The main dish has salad, pork chop, miso soup and rice. Pork chop was well done. Miso soup abit too salty. Overall, 3.8/5. v. Sirloin steak looked the most promising. Absolutely fantastic, the medium rare steak was delicious and the presentation was marvelous. Overall 4.5/5. vi. Sangria, a unique taste made by a mixture of alcohol and chopped fruits. x Long queue. x Expensive. vii. Paid about S$125 for four persons. Sirloin steak was the best and most expensive of all at S$25+. The average price for each dish is S$20.

Been here at bugis junction many times. The original ma maison restaurant.Enjoyed the hamburg steak with either Japanese or brown sauce. Brown sauce better. Appetizer escargo and scallop always nice.Come with children below 10 and get a free asahi beer as a dad.!!Weekend forget booking. Just need to queue.Ma maison central closed.

Had lunch 20 min before 3 pm , when the kitchen wud be closed , then we ordered potato gratin and garden salad . When it was served the potato gratin came in small portion 8- 10 cm in diameter with poor stuffs made from potato powder for making purée and some cheese and very thin form , taste just under usual since it wasn't made from real potato. The salad garden came pale with mostly the cheapest white leave salad , it was not as I expected like in japanese fusion resto . Even though the atmosphere is very OK, with very European with French flare decoration. Service is normal . Wifi is available and working , but no one told us , until we asked them the PW. It looks good though in the pic of potato gratin , but it is disappointing as we had been living in Europe almost 7 years.
4
Arrive there at peak hour, was told there was not table but counter service was available. So the two of us decided to give it a try. After 10 minutes, we saw a table was available and ask the wait staff if we could move to the table. She was very accommodating, she told us she will check and came back to us in few minutes and the table was cleared in a jiffy. (Window seat too!- Nice)Order the Shrimp ajilo while waiting for the main course. Well done , not overcook just nice and crunchy when we bite it. The main course was fast - garlic pork steak was out within minutes and the Tonkatsu - my friend was practically scraping the plate.Will go again - friendly staff nice deco! Try to get a window seat if you can
5
I read about this restaurant in a culinary blog. We happen to go to Bugis Junction and I rememebered I had read about it. We did not have a reservation, so we waited in line. It was definitely worth the wait. We had the house specialty which is a burger with no bread, that keeps cooking on the place as it simmer in a meaty sauce and is served with a fried egg. The ambience is really nice and the service is great
4
My friend and I again visited Ma Maison@Bugis Junction for lunch on 24 Feb 16. We ordered the set lunch for ourselves: Meatball and Dory with Tomato sauce, each served together with spaghetti, mashed potato and corn. Each set included a bowl of mixed vegetable salad, French loaf freshly-toasted, butter and jam, corn soup and coffee (nicely priced at $13.90++!). There were other choices for set lucnhes available.We polished off everything in no time; everything tasted wonderfully delicious (perhaps it was the late hour in the afternoon, being closed to 2 pm that we had such a good appetite). Other customers appeared to linger on after finishing their food as well. Apparently, enjoying a relaxing quiet time or a tete a tete
4
My friends and I had arranged to meet at Bugis Junction to have lunch to celebrate the new year on 2 Jan 16; and we were indeed glad (especially without prior booking on a weekend) that we were properly seated inside Ma Maison within 30 minutes, even as the queue at the entrance remained for some time.Although the premises had limited seating, the background jazzy and light music as well as the sedate interior decor (tasteful lighting and nostalgic paraphernalia within the premises) created a most restful and cosy ambience for patrons. Indeed, we could laze comfortably in the seats to enjoy the peaceful serenity as we savoured the food and drinks. We were satisfied with the French wine we drank: though it wasn’t top-notch pricing, it had proven its worth in lifting our celebratory spirits.The restaurant staff were their usual amiable selves, rendering excellent service overall. Likewise, food response was prompt and efficient.Truth be told, we had liked returning constantly to this original Bugis outlet ‘cos of 1) wide variety of tasty food options, including set menus (some characteristically East-meets-West e.g. escargot, steak-don, hamburger steak, spaghetti/pasta, omu-rice etc.) which were nicely-priced 2) friendly/attentive staff 3) nice atmosphere/setting as well as 4) easy accessibility/convenience of location.(See the photographs for the yummy food we had
4
We had been visiting Ma Maison@Bugis Junction regularly for the past years as it was one of our favourite fusion-food places for Japanese hamburger steak, beef steak, tonkatsu, garlic-butter escargot, spaghetti, omu-rice, green salad, fruit pies.We recently discovered a new Ma Maison outlet at Capitol Piazza with a fresh focus on ramen and tonkatsu; and which we had visited 4 times already: the most recent visit was in late November when we had lunch there with a visiting Indonesian friend.We had the creamy Hokkaido cheese shio-ramen, the tonkatsu pork-loin with special niku shoyu-ramen and the spicy miso-ramen (new item) - all served in big bowls - with some side-dishes, namely, pan-fried gyoza, deep-fried teriyaki chicken, salad.As it turned out, I was glad I had ordered a ‘mild spicy-level’ for the ramen bowl which was already too spicy to us for our comfort. I had to wash the food down with a few glasses of iced water. Surprisingly, our overseas friend was able to continually keep adding the chilli oil and chilli-pepper powder to his ramen broth; although sweating profusely throughout. Anyway, we were glad he appeared to enjoy the food.The place was cosy and conducive for small groups like ours. The ambience was open and friendly. The décor was relaxing and informal; but, patrons generally were appreciative of the Japanese features and thought in the restaurant furniture and layout.Definitely worth a return visit to check out the other exotic dishes
5
We went Ma Maison for dinner. It was on weekday and yet there is still visible crowd in the restaurant and guests just keep flowing in. We ordered Beef Stroganoff Omu rice and hamburg. The egg on Omu rice is fluffy and the stroganoff goes well with the rice. The beef is also very tender. Overall, they execute the whole dish very well. The portion is pretty small though
4
Went there with a friend from overseas. We ordered the No.1 / 人气 dish: Beef stroganov butter rice with slide beef + brown sauce wrapped in omelette. It's nice, and the rice blended well with the brown sauce and the beef slide is tender. We also order Corona beer. The beer is smooth and the ambience is nice to chill out with friends
4
When i visited this place, they have some queueing... But since there's only two of us and we didn't mind to have the seat bu the counter, we didn't spend that many time waiting...Anyway, the dishes were very good... Should try the cha soba salad, very fresh and delicious...Try also the tonkatsu and gratin riceIt's highly recommende

This is a review of Ma Maison's outlet at Bugis+ (formerly known as Iluma) which is right next to Bugis Junction.This outlet located at level one, is not an enclosed restaurant but linked to a row of other eating outlets. Still, it has a nice ambience and is cosy with its delightful deco. Service is friendly and attentive.Ma Maison serves quality food that does not scrimp on ingredients. Its daily set lunches are particularly worthwhile with prices ranging from $12.90++ to $16.50++ for a choice of main courses (7 sets to choose from) which come with soup, toasted bread with jam/butter, salad and tea or coffee or a scoop of yummy ice-cream.We like our main courses of grilled salmon, hamburger steak and teriyaki chicken. These were attractively presented with a serving of tossed spaghetti and delicious potato salad. The restaurant also has a selection of tempting fruit pies. Their pancake covered with an assortment of fruits looks heavenly too
4
We went there on a weekday for lunch - the place was mostly empty as we chose to arrive before the lunch crowd started coming in. Ordered two lunch sets - a teriyaki chicken set ($12.90) and a salmon set ($13.90). We also went for a plate of smoked salmon ($12.80) as an appetizer.The smoked salmon arrived promptly and was very fresh.The pasta/teriyaki chicken arrived next - man, the pasta was a real solid 5/5 stars. The texture was just right (not too soggy/soft, and not hard that you taste the flour still). I think this is what they call "al dente". However the chicken was a bit tough to the bite, despite it being a "chicken chop" (not breast meat).The pasta/salmon was similar - the pasta was real solid, and the salmon was cooked just nice.Hats off to the chef in the kitchen (a young lad I believe as I saw him through the glass windows).The server was prompt on refilling the water and attending to our requests whenever we gestured. She was kind enough to also explain the menu to us (since it was our first time here) and how to place an order for the lunch sets.Despite the fact that it was a weekday lunch (could have attributed to the great service), I will most likely return for another visit if I am in the area

tired after window shopping and i decided to have lunch at Ma Maison. I was interested with the menu. but more excited when staffs served with friendly. I ordered lunch package and came to me with sooo plenty foods, was great though. the foods were good and will be back someday :
3
We visited this restaurant as I was curious with their tonkatsu. We went there around 9pm and found that there is no queue but we were able to sit around 8mins later as no staff was serving us eventhough they only left with 3tables with customer and they are standing together at the kitchen counter. The food was just average for the price. Not going to visit here again anytime soon.

A quaint little Japanese-Western fusion restaurant located at Bugis Junction, and has been around for years (thankfully), well known for its delicious pasta and other dishes, Ma Maison was the choice for us that day as we headed for lunch.The Buddy selected the famous Hamburger Steak Set (SGD$16.50) - juicy, thick patty with sunny side up egg, side vegetables and mashed potato, served with rice or burger. The burger was tender, grilled to perfect with hints of smokiness to its flavor, yet still retaining the lusciousness of beef's natural flavor. Pity the Buddy asked for the egg to be cooked fully, because the steak is best eaten with the egg yolk poked and infusing the steak, adding to the taste.I had the Prawns and Scallops Gratin (SGD$13.80) - baked to a lovely golden color and slathered thickly with cheese. The huge fresh prawns and chewy scallops were delicious and lent credence to the cheesy pasta. The gratin melted in one's mouth literally, scoring points immediately.For dessert, there was a slice of Grape Tart - huge, juicy grapes that were sweet, not sour. They did not taste processed, and are laid out beautifully in red and green tones, atop a crunchy biscuit base. I loved how the grapes popped literally in our mouths before we settled the sweetness with the more solid crusty base.For full review and more photographs, please free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/lunch-at-ma-maison-japanese-restaurant.htm
4
Tried the seafood Paella and the cheesy bacon-ham prawn Pizza. The food was average and so was the service. The Paella lacked any distinct flavor or taste to it. More like glutinous rice snapped together with muscles. When I asked if there was Australian wine, was told no - but they did have some from Western Australia. Not that the WA wine would have bee as good as the Barossa valley Shiraz, but for a mid-market restaurant with a quaint set-up they ought to guide their foodies in a more engaging manner
4
Ordered the lunch set. Their brown sauce is very salty. However, I am simply amazed and impressed by the staff attention on guest. Every dishes came according without making my friend and I to wait or to ask. I will recommend and visit to try their other dishes. Keep it up
4
I ordered Ma Maison Float which is actually vanilla ice cream on mountain dew. The ambience of the restaurant is good and you can view the chef cook you dishes as you wait for your food or chat with your friends!
4
I order sirloin steak with black pepper sauce, fried Camembert with vinegar dip , cherry tart, and blueberries tart. All taste great.
3
This place looks promising but we were left disappointed. The pasta and soup were too salty and the other food were served cold.
4
Great tonkatsu with selection of meat. I chosed kurobuta. Selection of sauce is interesting as well as selection of beverage.
3
My partner's tonkatsu was OK and my pasta dish was just about passable though not very hot but the prices were way too expensive for the meal. $80 SGD for the 2 dishes with small starters and 2 small glasses of wine was, I felt, excessive. But I suppose that is what you pay for, being in Bugis St. I would not retur
1
I visited this restaurant for a dinner in a group of 3 persons. The staff asked me to wait. However, there was another group of 3 came later with no reservation as well but they were served first. Maybe there was an European guest in their group?We ended up with leaving the restaurant after that
4
Revisited this restaurant after my last many years back. Nice cozy ambience and service is good as usual. The signature hamburger steak still taste as before and the squid ink spaghetti is nice too. Generous portion for ala carte salad. Overall good food at reasonable price
4
I have been to this restaurant twice in this week mainly due to its excellent location (within Bugis Junction shopping centre), nice food and great customer service.The weekday set lunch is value for money and the serving staff are all polite and attentive to their customers' needs, thus making the dining experience a pleasant one
3
They have a variety of set meals to offer which are fairly priced . i tried garlic spaghetti with mushroom , which was good but could have been better. In the entire menu i couldnt find anything to cater for vegetarian . Though majority of time i have all variety of food while dining but this was surprising that menu has not a single food for vegetarian
4
if you are a fan of the pork cutlet done japanese style, you should definitely give Ma Maison a try. their fruit tarts are to die for - strawberry tend to be sold out pretty fast. most of the dishes are done french/japanese fusion style. along with the restaurant decor the dining experience is a breath of fresh air and suitable for intimate talks or chill-out catch up with friends.my recommendation would be escargots or the cha soba salad as great starters followed by the heavier main courses eg: beef stroganoff or tonkatsu set which will fill your tummy for sure and to finish off, nothing better than a slice of your favorite fruit (tart)!Great place which i frequently patronize and will continue to do so
3
Besutiful restaurznt snd smbience However not enough veggie choices. The chicken and the baked potato seems v good. French and Japanese fusion food
5
everything was perfect except the fact that the restaraut is abit small, food was well served. portion was just nice.service was least i expected. the crew was not very proactive though.
5
We walked pass a few times and decided to check it out. Food turns out amazingly delicious. We were able to view the chef cooking from scratch.
4
the ink spaghetti n the escargots are a must for every visit.. The set meals are reasonably priced n taste good.. Ambience is nice.. Been to all three branches prefers the one at Bugis..

First off, if you're thinking of dining here, please think twice, because you will incur the wrath of the "Kitchen God" inside the see-though kitchen, if you dare so much as to reject a poorly-cooked dish.On June 7, around 9pm, my gf and myself came by for dinner at the Ma Maison at Bugis Junction. The bad experience begun when I discovered that my steak was not done medium as I had asked, but medium rare instead. I highlighted that to the manager who brought the steak back to the kitchen and what happened next truly shocked me.The blonde, skinny guy in the kitchen (whom i assume was the chef) started throwing things, banging pots and pans, and creating a huge ruckus in the kitchen while giving a really pissed-off expression. The worst part was that he constantly stared at us menacingly while shaking his head, even when he knew that we could see all that through the glass.The wrong doneness of my steak, was tolerable. But this extremely lousy service attitude was beyond atrocious. I have been to many Japanese restaurants, but to experience bad service attitude at a reputable restaurant chain from Japan is inexcusable.The operations manager, manager and other staff did their part to do service recovery--They apologised as well as offered to waive off my steak and presented me with a dining voucher. However, the extremely terrible service attitude I encountered with that particular guy in the kitchen left a lasting smear on this establishment. I don't think customers would feel very comfortable eating in your restaurant while getting stared at when the food isn't up to par.I definitely won't be coming back, and neither should you

Ma Maison serves good Japanese style Western food.There are set lunches with burgers, Japanese style rice. I like also the ice coffee.The escargots are really delicious, and are worth adding as starters or appetizers to the set meals.Quaint is their giving you a huge metal key to show the cashier for the identification and payment your bill
4
I work just round the corner and have lunch with my colleagues here at least a couple of times a month. The lunch sets ++ which come up to <$20 are good value, especially with a soup as a starter, a baguette with jam/butter (or rice if you prefer), a mini salad, a main and coffee/tea/lemon tea. Nowhere else in Bugis can you get such quality at a low price. Portions are a tad small for the main dish (some variety on certain days, steak, fish, chicken chops etc.) if you're a ravenous eater or missed breakfast, but you should be reasonably filled.The fruit tarts are a delish dessert to pay extra for if you have the space for them. Service can be harried during lunch when they're crowded, as this place is pretty packed at lunch most days. Either go at 11.45am or near 2pm to be assured seats.I've also had the a la carte items for the impromptu dinner or two here but definitely prefer the well-priced lunch sets. Dinner ends up being a tad too expensive for fusion-Japanese cuisine
4
The ambience of the restaurant is cozy and warm like a cottage home. The service used to be much better. The food is good, especially the escargots, squid ink pasta, paella, croquette. The squid ink pasta is a personal favourite. Try it, especially if you don't mind the ink staining your whole mouth. The tarts were too sweet for me. Order it only if you like very sweet stuff
5
I was blown away. I will never look at katsu the same way again.Never thought pork could be sooo soft and tasty. Ordered the mangalikaPork and iberico pork katsu.Just melts in our mouth. Goes well with the diced cabbage with vinegar sauce.Bliss! Eat here you will live it

We were early for dinner thus there is no need to queue as there is no reservations for this restaurant. We ordered 3 dishes Omu-rice with beef steak in stone bowl, Tonteki pork steak with special "TONKATSU Sauce", Squid ink pasta & Onion gratin soup. The Onion soup comes with puff cheese pastry covered on top of the soup cup and taste a bit salty due to the cheese. Quite disappointed with the Omu-rice as the rice comes with some pickles and few slices of beef. I would prefer the squid ink pasta even though there is not much ingredient but is tasty in their own style. The Tonteki pork is rather juicy and taste great with the "TONKATSU" sauce.Overall, for the pricing of about $20+/pax, I feel that this place is wonderful if you do not have very high expectation of quality food
5
Must try dish ... Seafood Risotto ... always satisfied ...
Will avoid outlet @ Central (Clark Quay) due to untrained inexperienced staff ... highly recommend Bugis outlet
3
Nice ambience, generally quiet and slightly romantic. Steak's good! A little pricey though, so be prepared for an expensive meal!
4
Great decor and cosy feel when we walked in. The waitress gave my toddler a toy to keep him occupied when we had our meal. Ordered the steak and it was decent i guess.
The tarts are a must to try! Reservation is recommended
5
Calling all ladies to go on Monday because it's ladies' night! Discount! Check out their cake and be spoilt for choice! Ambiance is cozy and wonderful too!
4
The food is good but some dishes are somewhat little, like the hot salad dish I had. The set meal with omu rice and burger was definitely more than sufficient. the omu rice was also good. The highlight was definitely the mixed berry tart. Seemed to be made with fresh berries. The service is better than the last time i went. I find the japanese service staff to be very warm and attentive. The others were kind of 'just doing my job' attitude. Overall service was above average. The seating is definitely uncomfortable because the space is tight. The aisle can only accomodate 1 person at anytim
4
Big love for the atmosphere abd decor, ordered a bottle of red wine from Chile, Tonkatsu set, hamberger steak, veg salad n one scalop appetizer. A delightful night, all food were above average but serve the best in such set and i particularly like the key for every table's bill, just like checking out from a vintage hotel. We also ordered the a cake w blackbetties n strawberry + lemon cheesecake! Would deginitely come back
3
Maybe I was expecting too much. I ordered Hungary Mangaloca Pork Loin Set. It came with tonkatsu, rice, miso soup and a cabbage salad. The cabbage salad was very good with the dressing but the tonkatsu was alright but not to die for.Music was very loud.Reservations are a must depending on the hour
4
The moment we stepped into this restaurant , tucked away in a corner of the mall, we were awed by the decor. Dimly lit surrounding with the woody furnishing enhances the dining experience.We shared 2 appetisers and had 1 main each.The presentation of the escargot is superb. It would be better if they have put in more garlic and butter.Wine selection is good enough and we had a bottle of Muscat.Overall pricing is acceptable.Service is attentive too
4
I've had two visits to this delighful restaurant. The food is very good value and the wine is not oveppriced for Singapore. The salads are wonderfully fresh, the clam chowder was tasty and hot. The shrimp and salmon gratin was piping hot with lots of flavour. Great service and friendly staff. I will be returning
3
If you love breaded food the Japanese way, then this is the place to go in Singapore. Tonkatsu or the breaded pork is most sought after. They have different pork which have different nationality or imported from different places. They also have breaded prawn and oysters for those who do not like pork. However, I don't think I'd line up again for their tonkatsu. Don't see much difference in terms of taste with the others I've tasted. Probably, tender but not good enough to line up for 45 mins! It's not value for money at all, paid $31 for my tonkatsu set
4
is cream spag is what i usually ordered, portion is large for one person. However, as most of their dishes contain beef so for non beef taker, choices can be limited.
3
Food served is delicious but I find its variety somewhat limited. It will be good if they can beef up its menu.
4
I ordered the Tonkatsu. What else? I have been here 5 times and never been disappointed by the Tonkatsu. And that is the ONLY reason I came here. To eat Tonkatsu. The choices are interesting but they are all pork from different countries fried to a breaded crispy piece. I wish I could say more but my fear is that I might suddenly run off and look for the restaurant at this late hour.If you have been utterly destoryed by the Tonkatsu from the normal Japanese chains then come to Tonkatsu heaven at Ma Maison (Mandarin or Bugis Junction) and indulge

This review applies to Tonkatsu Ma Maison at the Mandarin Gallery in Orchard Rd...Perhaps it was because I've been expecting too much because of the ridiculous reviews I've read about the tonkatsu but I have to say i've had better. My boyfriend and I ordered the Hungary Mangaloca Pork Loin Set. It came with tonkatsu, rice, miso soup and a cabbage salad. While reviews touted the breading to be light and airy, I thought it had TOO much breading and every bite I took I felt oil gushing out of my mouth. Though the meat was juicy and tender, the 1/4 of FAT in each piece was really gross and unappetizing, so was the two end pieces of FAT.Even my boyfriend who was ravenous couldn't finish the meat because he thought it was too fatty. We ordered the Jumbo Prawns which looks absolutely tasty but again the breading was just TOO much. We ended up tossing away most of it and ate the prawns by itself, which of course tasted like any other prawn without the breading or any marinate. The sauce was really good though. Perfect combination of sweet, salty and tangy

I had dinner here with a friend and was impressed by the ambience. The food is mostly a fusion of Japanese with other cuisines. We started dinner with escargot, which was nice with the garlic butter. For mains, my friend had the Keema curry with rice, which she said was quite spicy. My oven-baked fish with Camembert and basil sauce was good, although the fish was a little dry. Dessert was the famous Ma Maison tarts (one Mont Blanc and one blueberry), and they lived up to their billing!One tip: the tarts sell out very fast, so as soon as you get a table, ask your server to reserve your desired tarts! Otherwise you might be disappointed if you wait until after your dinner
4
Have always wanted to try out this place, read a couple of good reviews and dropped by for lunch, dinner and desserts within a 1 month period. My first visit was "prompted" by a voucher that a friend had given me.Their corn soup packed a punch but the onion soup was passable. We have tried the Japanese pasta which was very plain and the hamburger steak, which sauce was too bitter for my liking. Skipped all of their fried stuffs so can't comment on their tonkatsu...But what I love the most is their desserts. The seasonal creme brulee, the matcha pudding, and their cakes. It's worth dropping by just for their desserts
4
I always found this place a nice hangout place for the quality of the food although it is quite pricey compare to other Japanese French cuisine. I loved the ambience and the decoroation in the restaurant.We started with baked escargots, I dun really take shell seafood but the escargots are nice. It served quite special as seeing in the picture below, they are place on a plate of sand and when it served, you will still see flame of fire.Seafood Paella not too bad, but I will prefer the Squid Ink Pasta. Not many restaurant serve Squid Ink Pasta and Ma Maison has one of the better one. Ma Maison is famous for its Hamburger Steak and is one of my favourite. It serve with a sunny side-up sitting on top. The steak is thick and juciy.Their dessert is superb. First time try Mont Blanc and I love it. If you are coming to this restaurant, you should try it

I found this restaurant by chance, as there are not many Japanese style western food in Singapore. Sure there are plenty supposedly Japanese-western restaurants, but the fare served are confusion rather than fusion.Just had another satisfying meal there two days ago. Not much variety but they are good with what they serve. The squid-ink spaghetti never disappoints and their tonkatsu are better than those served at a restaurant that specialises in it!Expect to wait for a table, especially for dinner on weekends including Fridays. The staff are friendly and do their best to cater to our needs, though the crowd makes it a little difficult.They accept reservations but have a portion of the place kept for walk-in customers. So if you must dine there, do try to make a reservation a week in advance. I tried a day before and was told that there's no more tables left for reservation. In the end, I waited closed to 45 min for a table

It's suppose to be Japanese Western Cuisine. Service has been compromised somehow. Not exactly that Japanese. I couldn't even make out if they were welcoming me at the door as I stepped in, or were they just reciting part of their employment contract. Food was ok nonetheless
5
As a great fan of Japanese style western food, I was quite delighted to find this restaurant. I tried the Hamburg Lunch set, and was so amazed with the overall quality. Waitress maintains good level of attentiveness, which is still a rare stuff in Singapore. The only down side is the price: this is even expensive than in Tokyo. But I am also surprised so many local people dine here from early lunch time. ideal for dates, quiet lunch admosphere seeker

Japanese & Western Fusion menu offered
5
Nice ambience, good food. A little pricey though.
3
Very nice Japanese restaurant with cozy ambience. Painstakingly detailed attention was paid to the decor. Quality of food was above average, unfortunately prices were also above average (dinner). I will visit again to try their set lunch.
5
Hmm, my favourite with a great ambience, its Jananese fusion here. Must make reservation before u go!
4
Nice Ambience
5
Love the Food, especially the steak..Simply YUMMY! Cosy environment
4
Yummy but a bit expensive
4
Nice Jap-French fusion
4
Interesting fusion twist... Japanese with a hint of French food.Cozy, casual ambiance. Could be Singapore's best squid ink (cuttlefish) pasta, heavy on the squid flavor and not just the black coloring. If the mentaiko pasta is available, be sure to order that too. It's a frequent but not daily special

Been here because of the good reviews in hungrygowhere.com My friends and I had their 4 courses set lunch which includes the soup, mini salad, main course (Set A to F to choose from) and a drink/ice cream.Together my friends had set A, B and for myself is C, and a side order of escargots.The soup of the day is mushroom soup, which is fairly well with the nice aroma of mushroom, neither too thick nor thin, just nice and comfortable for drinking the whole bowl of it. A little dash of pepper will do it better.The mini salad is quite fine too, with parmesan cheese added is a plus point.For main course, I will review on my set which is hamburger steak with brown sauce. I find the brown sauce is kinda too salty, as I am not a fan of sodium. It's really a big minus point to me. The tiny potatoe salad on the plate with it is nice though. My friend who is having the teriyaki chicken set with pasta, her sauce is also quite salty. Guess the chef should improve on controlling his amount of salt, or whatever that cause the sauce to be salty.For drinks, nothing special to be review about. Just the normal ice tea, I thought.Escargots supposingly garlic buttered doesn't absorb the marination. It's like, if you just pull out the meat, and the sauce just trip away, you put the meat into your mouth, it's totally tasteless.Not sure if I will return, as usually the main course is the one that matter most, and I am kinda disaapointed by it.No doubt it has nice ambience, staffs and service though. Kinda cute for the bill settling with hotel key look-alike

The service there is wonderful. The overall ambience gives you a nice and cosy feeling like dinning in an overseas home. The food is great too!! Love the Escagot & Tonkatsu & the salad sauce!! By the way, the premium Japanese rice they use is really yummy even if eating only the rice alone!! The rice is so glossy and it shines... My Love!

Ambience is better than the food

italian-japanese fusion doesnt work well... pricey. and one of our orders took exceptionally long to arrive. arrived when the rest were almost done with their meal.
4
This place has the most wonderful beef burger patty. The patty is soft, moist and melts in your mouth. Highly recommended. This Jap restaurant have many Japanese eating here, so the standard is quite high.

A expensive place to go to but got nice ambience
5

4
French Japanese cuisine.
3
Escargots!
3
Like the food, though a little bit on the fusion side. Ambience is good and they provide little toys for children to keep them occupied.
3
I'm confused. Ambience is nice, food is above average, but personally still a purist. Jap-pseudo-Western doesn't go for me
2
Fusion food...french-japanese. Nothing fabulous to rave about...
5
Among the 1st few restaurants that offered Japanese-Italian fusion back then... and they are good!
2
I didnt like the Hamburg at all!
3
Nice setting. Lighting is dark.
4
The onion gratin soup was quite nice and the place was quite cosy.
3
Love the clam chowder and tiramisu.
5
Excellent ambience and food, mainly european-japanese fusion cuisine. Must try the Hamburger steak. Children and family friendly.
2
good deco and cosy place. but the food does not worth the price.
2
small portion and not very nice food, quite pricey
4
quiet little spot... good for a romantic date..
1
Food not so special & it comes with a price which I think doesn't matches the simple food served...
3
Tried the branch at Central tonight and was quite impressive. The ambience is good, quite romantic and the service is good (by japanese waitress). I would consider the food as acceptable.
3
Nice..
3
Quite unique. Jap western...try the Cuttlefish Ink Pasta & escargos :P
3
The paela is delicious. A comforting food.
5
favourite haunt! only goes to Central's

Great set lunches, my local fav Japanese western joint.
3
Nothing special.
4
Agree with Bernard. This restaurant really has nice atmosphere. A good place to have a glass of wine.
3
Great fusion of Western vs Japanese foods!
4
I love the decor of the restaurant...reminded me of a British pub. But more romantic haha. Food-wise, the portion is a little too small, but pretty unique. The preparation time is a little longer than other places. The restaurant is always crowded, so it is worth a try
2
Relaxed country ambience, family-friendly atmosphere, good service. Average food quality.. can be just that tad oily.
3
Not much variety for Jap Western food
5
Great atmosphere, great food.
3
I like the atmosphere.
Hamburg is slightly salty but the pizza and pasta are not bad
3
Food's ok, but it's the rustic decor that lends this restaurant charm
3
Very cozy surrounding. Those who love beef patty, this is one place where the patty is good
1
Portion of food is small. Not worth the price.
4
For the ambience
3
surprisingly good selection. The pork cutlet not as good as Ton Kitchi but other french/Jap foods were pretty ok
1
Tacky decor and less than satisfactory food and service.
3
great ambience
4
Super Food
4
not too bad... :)
4
The set lunches and side dishes are great.

Always a favourite of mine: nice ambience and good food
4
The carbonara is yummy!
4
love the Omu rice and squidink spag! xD
3
cosy place.price on the high side.
4
love the food
3
Nice cozy restaurant. Omu butter rice tastes slightly better than average. Hamburg was a tad too salty and the sauce was overwhelmingly strong.
