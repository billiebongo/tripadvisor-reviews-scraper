It is with extreme sadness that I have to report this fantastic ramen restaurant has closed down. Daikokuya has served such great, affordable ramen & dons for many years. Their staff were always generous and polite. It is genuinely sad to see them go.

We came after 9pm, and came to a relatively quiet place. Service provided was impeccable: they offered more of the clear broth to dilute the tsukemen dipping gravy, as well as to warm up said gravy when it turns cold! Will definitely come back againüëè

Ramen was good and price is okay. Choices are limited though as compared to the ramen restaurants I have been to. Service was fast.

Like the kamatama udon, something different. Didn't really like the gizzard heart , liver & chicken minced cause not a liver fan!service was great . Staff was attentive and friendly . Overall worth trying

It will be injustice if i dont write a review on this as i have been patronizing them for years and their standards have always been very high. I have had tsukemen all over the world, including in different parts of Japan, but this is still by far my favourite. Note: However i only refer to their tsukemen and not their typical ramen. Their noodles is exceptionally "Q" and springy and their fish and pork combination soup base is perfect for me. It may taste abit salty at firsr but the spup is meant for dipping and not drinking directly. Theres instruction on how to properly finish the meal. For me, i like to add the clear soup to the rich soup base at the end and top it up with raw garlic (u gotta request from them) and its just amazing and a comfort food for me. I brought numerous friends here and almost all of them liked it, which surprised me to see that they usually have no queue, unlike the mass markets ramen brands out there, which honestly, some are very average. Try this Tsukemen and i am sure u will like it! My review is only gonna be meant for the shop in Robertson quay (and not the others as they seem to sell different food)

Stopped by for dinner on 25th Sept. Was really impressed with food presentation, even better after tasting their ramen (i can't remember which one i ordered as the friendly waiter suggested it). generous portion of meat, crabstick, seaweed, bamboo shots. the broth was very tasty. Nice cosy place, prices were reasonable, staff equally friendly and alert

I have lived in Korea for two years and I have had wonderfully made ramen, but Daikokuya's take on Japanese ramen was a wonderful experience. I know that paying $15 Singapore Dollars may seem like a lot for ramen, but the food prepared was very worth it. The staff were very professional and quick to meet their customers' needs. If you want something a little different, try Daikokuya's. I think you will be happy you did

Came here today for our weekly ramen session with our 4 year old daughter. I tried the special ramen and complemented it with some gyoza. Wife and daughter shared the tsukemen special ramen, while our friend had the miso ramen. We were all very happy with the results and I expect we will be back for more in the not too distant future

I was staying at the park hotel and had tried a few places in the area and not that impressed, I was looking for something different to have for dinner, I was craving a nice hearty meal and I found this place down a lane.I got a seat as soon as i walked in, they had some deal on Asahi's so I got that whilst reading menu. I ordered their special at the time which was an entree and main- chicken curry. The meal was super nice- just what I was craving for and really satisfied my hunger! I will eat here next time in Singapore for sure, great food and service
