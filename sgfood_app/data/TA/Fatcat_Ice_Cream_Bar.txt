Must be one of the pioneers that combined salted egg sauce and waffles together. It's really delicious! Must try.

It's worth the visit if you are in Singapore. Loved the concept, we had the charcoal and gingerbread waffles and they were delicious.

We visited on a weekday afternoon, so the cafe was not too crowded, except for a few students from nearby schools who had come here to enjoy their post-exam ice cream treat.FATCAT has a wide range of ice cream flavours. I wish I could try them all, but that would have to wait for another time. This is their range of ice creams flavors, with some classic flavors while others, having a unique twist to them such as that of the butterbeer which I loved. The subtle taste of alcohol within the smooth, creamy ice cream

We finished our dinner and hoping to find a dessert cafe nearby, searched in google and found this cafe. The cafe is crowded but we still managed to find a seat for two, since we just eaten our dinner and thus we only ordered one scoop of ice cream to try. They have many unique flavors and choices, in the end we have chosen this mango chili, which have a sweet taste of mango and after a while have a small scene of spicyness but not that spicy at all, very hard to described the taste but for someone who do not take spicy at all, this ice cream is totally acceptable. There are charcoal flavor waffle available too, definitely will go back to try, highly recommended

While waiting for our table, I just stood by the display and tried almost all the flavours that they have, and most of them are really good! The Earl Grey Lavender goes without saying as it is one of the best seller, I in particular liked the Hay & Honey, Black Sesame & one that's quite special - Edamame! And their Charcoal Waffle is really crispy, goes very well with the ice creams! Nice place to chit chat over dessert and a cuppa

Back here for a second time after two years and the desserts still don't disappoint! Enjoyed their charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce, and they have a great variety of ice cream to choose from too! Will be back again if I am around Bedok next time

Went there for dessert but was sad to say that their ice cream is just like haagen daas that you can buy from supermarket but you pay through your nose. Two waffles with 3 scoops of ice cream for $30/- is just too high a price for a creamery in a HDB neighborhood. Their service was not fantastic either as we need to cramp amongst other customers as we sit back-to-back with the next table. Just not worth the money and tim

The food isn't especially tasty or delicious, however it is overall good.I only rate this place highly due to providing a unique experience for ice cream & waffles. It is obvious they care about their product and costumer experience.Service is great and food is quality. Portions a bit too big though I wish they would offer mini waffles.Worth a visit

Their signature seems to be that of the charcoal waffle ($6), topped with salted egg yolk sauce ($1). Scoops of ice cream are priced additionally, around $4 per scoop. Definitely very interesting ice cream flavours (e.g. watermelon soju, smoked chocolate, hay and honey) with very strong tastes - it might take a bit of getting used to if you're more acquainted with the usual, simple flavours that most ice cream parlours offer

A sure hit with the younger crowd.. the chef served our brunch personally.He explained the dish with so much passion, I could already taste it.Foirgras Truffle: I would have preferred the Wagyu a little more rare but still the fish was presented beautifully. The slice of gooseliver was lightly seared producing a candied caramelized texture. Served with a soft cooked Ramen egg. $20.. :)Perfect.Fatcat bowl: Presented so nicely that a sushi master chef would be proud. Sashimi salmon served with a mixture of avocado and compressed watermelon. Accompanied by a glass of warm dashi.$16.I've already made up my mind to come again next week after I return from Amsterdam. Cos I'm too full to eat the ice cream.

Amazing waffles & icecream. Must try the salted egg yolk. I went early afternoon, but I think it gets quite busy at night.

A must have is the charcoal waffles and the salted egg yolk sauce. Pair it with 2 scoops of ice cream and it's a match made in heaven. Would recommend butterscotch and sesame. They do offer plated desserts that change every month or so.

We chanced upon this ice cream bar when they first open. Their ice cream & waffles are really yummy. Ice cream not too sweet! Waffle taste good as well. Romantic ambience! Suitable for couples!

Definitely a must to try the Charcoal Waffle with Salted egg yolk sauce! Overall food experience was good however the ice cream was too sweet for my liking.

Charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce is a must-try when paired with creamy ice cream flavors. Plated desserts are also very reasonably priced given the quality of ingredients and plating skills. Definitely will return!

Visited this place and found their ice cream to be really great. Ordered a waffle with ice-cream and really enjoyed it. The waffle was freshly made and went well with the ice-cream. The furnishing of this joint is basic but quite hip. Definitely a joint for young people

We came at about 9pm thinking that its a bit too late for dessert so not much people already. Oh boy!! We are oh so wrong. There was quite a queue. And because we purposely went to find this dessert shop, we decided to stay. Waited for almost 30 mins. When we finally got in, we decided to order 2 types of the waffle so we can compare which is better. Too bad they run out original brown butter so we settled with 2 Crispy charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce topped with home-made macadamia ice cream..oooh so sinfully yummy!! It was a very huge serving that 2 person can actually share but it was so good i finished the whole waffle by myself. Talk about gluttony. Would definitely come back if I'm back in Singapore

A small shop (accomodate about 16-20 persons) in the neighbourhood operated by some young adults. No reservation. Usually packed on Saturday night, queuing required. Place order and make payment over the cashier.Their signature waffle is the charcoal waffle with salted egg sauce. My friend ordered and I tried a little, nothing fabulous. Personally, I preferred the original waffle with ice cream. Ice cream is about $5 per scoop. Original waffle about $5, Charcoal waffle about $6. Salted egg sauce at additional $1. Average about $15 per person per meal

I was there on Sunday, so expected it will be crowded. Nonetheless, waited for 15 mins only (not too bad).I ordered the normal buttermilk waffle with salted caramel plus milk tea ice-cream and charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce plus earl grey ice-cream. Personally I don't really like the salted egg yolk sauce, it doesn't really blend well with the waffle. However their waffles are fluffy and airy. Besides waffles and ice-creams, they have good coffee and ....etc (check it out..)If you are a big fan of waffle, can give try

I don't really like their waffles, prefer their plated desserts much more!Have tried both the charcoal and normal waffles, crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. Salted egg yolk sauce was a little too dilute for my liking. Tried the jade ice cream bar which was sea salt green tea, couldn't taste the sea salt portion of it. Wish they had the fat cat ice cream bar available which is salted egg yolk ice cream. November's plated desserts - milk & honey and faux passion fruit. Burnt honey ice cream with honey hay ice cream with blood orange slices and honeycombs.Faux passion fruit came with a pre dessert of chocolate encased balls of passion fruit juice. The main dessert had curry crumble with fior di latte and passion fruit cake sphere with nata de coco etc. Service is less than to be desired. Sometimes you've got to queue, sometimes you don't, no one is around to tell you what to do which leads to people just walking in and waiting around tables. Cashier is a little frazzled at times. Staff who bring the dessert to you are much better as they explain to you the dessert and what it consists of etc. It's just the queuing to the ordering that's a little messed u
