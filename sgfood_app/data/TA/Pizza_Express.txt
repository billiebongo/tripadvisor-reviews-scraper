The food at Pizza express is great. Service is a bit slow but the place is casual. Specifically love the mushroom pasta, dough balls and pizza with capers, olives and onions. Highly recommend the eatery!

Location is good. This pizza express is in a shopping mall at orchard road.
The pizza was very good. I would definitely come back if I would be in the neighborhood.

I used the entertainer one-for-one voucher. Ordered a prawn pasta and parma ham pizza. The prawns were big and fresh. The pizza dough was thin and crispy.

I had booked a table for 1 o’clock and when I arrived they told us that there was none. We ordered straight away, and waited 30 mins, no food. We asked multiple times and they said they would check but they never told us. We asked for water and they told us that there were no more cups. Even the people next to us who were here waaaayy longer than we were got served at the same time as us. When the food finally came, we weren’t even able to finish it before having to run out for other commitments. The service is HORRIBLE and when we looked into the kitchen we just saw the waiters and cooks goofing around and chatting. Unacceptable behaviour and way to overpriced if we get treated like this. I would rate it no stars but it’s not possible on this app

Pro's: We enjoyed our food as it was fresh and tasty, delivered in an adequate time too.Con's: Service seemed a lil disorganized and a general lack of attention. Shirley was one of the service crew where you had the feeling she was not really interested nor customer oriented, sadly. Branch Manager (Lady) was kind of all over the place but it didn't help really either

We visited Pizza Express for my son's 6th birthday dinner. He chose the pasta option as part of kids meal. His pasta portion size was extremely small and he asked if he could have a little more. The manager told us "no" - only if he ordered the whole kids meal again. My husband asked her to check if it wasn't possible to have a little more - it was just plain pasta with butter. A resounding "no". We spent over $100 for dinner and whilst the rest of the waiting staff were very good - it was extremely extremely disappointing that they couldn't provide excellent customer service - they didn't even offer more with a small additional cost, which we would have paid. Based on this, I shall never visit this particular outlet again. The rest of the meal was adequate but next time we'll go to Jamie's Italian

If you are looking for great pizza. This is the place to go. It is hidden in the lower level of a mall, but don't let that fool you. If you come during peak hours you know many have discovered it is a great place - so either book in advance or stan in line a bit.Service is great.This is where I good for the best pizza in Singapore

Looked after very well at this branch of the ever popular pizza chain. Being in the basement of a shopping mall, which did little for the ambiance of the place.Our pizza was spoilt by having raw peppers ( should be roasted). Very good wait staff though, even if the manager decided to call an impromptu staff meeting in full view of all the customers, whilst leaving no one on duty....... strange decision

For those planning to visit on weekends, it’s better to make a reservation to avoid the queue. Just go for the pizzas and not the pastas or drinks. Ordered a few pasta dishes for sharing and all tasted bland especially the laksa pasta and aglio olio. Could have done better given the price that diners are paying. Pizzas were not fantastic but they do fare better than other mains.Visited Pizza Express for a birthday celebration but was told that they do not allow outside cake (which I understand), so the supervisor offered a slice of cake on the house, but unfortunately the cake tasted really really bad so it kind of dampened the celebration

Nice service and pizza was OK, but was tiny and the wine serving by the glass was the smallest I've seen anywhere. For half the price you can have a better meal in Singapore.

Went there for quick lunch and both our pizza and drinks was amazing. Service was also quick and fast. Definitely going back to try more pizzas and pastas from their menu.

Great place to visit, definitely worth a shot. A little pricey, but it's worth it. Food tastes great, especially the pizza. Drinks taste great! Loved it there! Though the serving time was a little slow, the food was worth it. A clean environment, great place to visit

I went to their branch in Duo Galleria, Fraser St. Nice facility!One of the best tasting pizzas in Singapore for me. I tried the Lava Classic Pizza which was simple enough with black olives, cherry tomatoes, basil leaves and burrata cheese. Key ingredient has to be the passata and the pizza dough which is made fresh daily and prepared after orders are placed. Add a couple of drops of chili oil and the pizza tastes a notch better. Perfect companion is a small kettle of hot tea from a combination of lemon, ginger and lychee. End the meal with mango panna cotta or Italian custard dessert. This is an awesome ender. Pizza is basically not a cheap meal. So be prepared to spend higher than usual.

I visited the recently opened outlet on North Bridge road this week for lunch. Opted for the Parma ham pizza which came out just the way I like it: nice and crisp. Only minor criticism was that it took a while to arrive, but the end product was worth the wait. Happy to return for another visit.

I was very used to eating Pizza express in Jakarta. I was disappointed to see earlier that there was no Pizza express in Singapore but when this opened in Scotts road we were the first ones to visit it. The dough balls are better than Jakarta and the way they accessorize it with red white mix. Aglio Olio cooked in olive oil is so light and healthy. Moreover any Pizza you choose is so fresh and crisp. You can have many. Once I sat there for 4 hours with my friends. It has always been a real good experience!!

The pizza was everything we expected, like what we had in London. The crust was thin and tasty. We had the caeser salad with chicken as well. Not the best we've ever had, but good enough. Quick service despite the busy lunch hour. The only negative thing was not about the food, but the rather cold decor/ambience where we sat - at the open area near the escalator

Service was prompt and food beautifully plated. Staff were polite and attentive. Great recommendations by one of the staff, Richard. We ordered Garlic Bread with Cheese ($6), Lava Pizza ($22), Linguine Granchio ($23) and Mango Panna Cotta ($8). Believe it or not refillable Fresh Ice Lemon Tea only cost $4! Truly enjoyed my dinner! Thumbs up to Richard and team!

Happy to report that this Pizza Express is as good as the originals in the UK.The pizza is authentic Italian style with a thin crust and not too many toppings. So if you like your pizza Deep Pan and loaded, don't bother.If you like the pizza served in Rome, then this is the place for you

Regularly like to go for Sunday night pizza and beer (nice peroni on tap). Lava pizza is good, had the pollo forza and calabrese, also very good. Wife had the veneziana, that one was very disappointing. Base was over cooked and cheese tasted burnt, complained to the restaurant, very nice about it but didn't do anything. I like the place but will be an uphill struggle taking the wife again after her experience tonight
