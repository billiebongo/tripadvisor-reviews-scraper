Good for tea time snack. Personally feel best to go with black coffee as the pastry is quite sweet for me, so the black coffee and brush away some of the sweetness.

Whenever I'm in Raffles City, never fail to get a few boxes of junior home. Not too sweet and fast service. Thumbs up.

How can you not come to Singapore and have a chewy junior someone needs to franchise these as they are just the best. A must do stop at Bugis to try one

Chewy Junior has been in Singapore as long as I can remember. I used to eat these occasionally when I was younger. The treats are cheap and very varied, a must-try when visiting this city along with the other classics.

They have the recipe right. So good and great selection. The best cream buns ever. 6 for 5 or 12 for $10, only ever costs $10 for 6. Lookout world

My husband and I were visiting Singapore and stayed in the Swissotel directly above Raffles City. We passed the Chewy Junior shop several times and considered buying some treats to sample but were dissuaded by the price. However, one evening we passed by as they were closing up and were selling the treats off for a discounted price. We selected a variety of sweets and were very pleased that the staff were very honest and straightforward in suggesting the different options we should or should not try. These little dessert gems were amazing! I wish we had have discovered them earlier in our trip. We will definitely be visiting Chewy Junior again when we next visit Singapore

This store at Chewy Junior at Bugis Junction, Victoria Street, sells creamy puff in different varieties, and I had the opportunity of testing one of them just for the sake of tasting. The puffs are so delicious that I might buy another air ticket to Singapore just for the sake of eat this delicious things
