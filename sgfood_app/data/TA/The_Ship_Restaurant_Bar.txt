had a old reunion gathering here, a place we gathered 2 decades ago for lunch. the dinner food items were decent, and the ambiance still reminiscent of the good old days. had the fried fish soup, which was still delicious, would come back again!

Old world charm at this local-Western joint, popular with local families. The three-course lunch is a great deal. We had the sliced fish soup and fish and chips, generous portion and tasty!

I ordered the fish bee Hoon soup which is a common Singapore dish. The soup is tasty and the fish was well fried. We also ordered the pork loin but the taste was a little light. The price is reasonable at Orchard road.

Many times here before, and the food is still as good. We had the popular fried fish soup noodles executive dinner set, which comes with a drink and dessert. The fried fish soup was really delicious, with the crispy fried fish served separately from the soup. Due to the crowd was a little disappointed that the service was a little shabby with forgotten orders and curt replies from new staff, but all in all still a great dinner place

I remembered coming to this place when I was a child, had such great memories then... 30 years on this place has turned to trash.Service is terrible, ribeye was poorly marbled, ordered medium came well done. Wait staff offered no apologies and jus walked off, the steak returned medium rare even on the edges. I left it after 2 bites. Do not come.... many many many better restaurants in Singapore. Hawker centers be better ...

Ordered 2 fish soup noodle set lunch; one with fried fish and the other white fish fillet. The 2 bowls of noodle soup came at the same time, the soup is lukewarm.The one with the fish fillet is ready to eat but the other order of fried fish was not served together. When asked, the staff said "coming". Well, it did come 10 mins later and we ended up eating the noodle soup which obviously has turned cold. Common courtesy to wait till your lunch partner's food has arrived. Why the fried fish and the (should be HOT) noodle soup can't be served together is mind-boggling. Kills the whole dining experience.

This restaurant is a fixture for Hainanese style Western food. Conveniently located at Shaw Centre ( junction of Orchard Road/Scotts Road). We were there for a birthday lunch at the request of the Birthday boy as he had many fond memories of the place. The restaurant was crowded but our orders were served without undue delay. The set lunch of half lobster thermidor and steak was very substantial and reasonable priced $34.90 .There was also a selection of other lower priced set lunches including the restaurant’s signature fish noodle soup. The a la carte menu is quite extensive with soups, salads , classic dishes like fish and chips, grills, etc. The price is reasonable for the quality of the food and the location.

A gem of a restaurant with good food, good service, clean and efficient. Had fried fish slices with noodles, followed by a delicious and moist cake with coffee as part of the set lunch. My wish is that restaurants such as the SHIP will continue to sail for many years to com

Went for birthday lunch appointment at the ship restaurant a few days ago. Reception staff was helpful and courteous. Food served could be spaced out instead of coming too early ie between the soup and main course. By the time soup finished, main course was cold and the sauce on it was dried out.Staff was kind to present a slice of cake topped with a candle lighted up. Commendable for the lovely gesture.As the lunch time crowd picked up, service standard slowed down which is understandable. Downside is staff seemed to ignore our request even when we signalled for the bill. As we were rushing for another appointment, I just had to walk over to the cashier to ask for my bill. Fortunately, I walked over if we were to wait longer, it probably would delay our time further.Would really hope the management will look into how to manage the lunchtime or any peak hours crowd; especially when customers really need staff for assistance and not just ignoring customers’ need.Overall, happy with the experience

This is a large and popular restaurant, known to generations of Singaporeans. They are crowded and rather noisy, much appreciated for their fried fish noodle soup, which is a generous portion and makes for a good and satisfying meal. We also tried their Mexican chicken, and ox tail set lunches. The chicken was tasty, but their oxtail dish needs improvement. Good efficient service and good value for your money.
4
Nice ambience, reasonably delicious food with warm service. Satisfactory enough as a casual family dining venue.
3
The restaurant is very basic, choice of alcohol limited and the food is average. Service OK but again not special. Very expensive for what it is
4
The fish soup is still as delicious after all the years. Quaint spot in the busy Orchard stretch for some old school nostalgia and comfort food.

This place has been a popular fixture to many Singaporeans since way back. I remember coming here during my secondary school days 20 years ago, enjoying the student set prices on western meals that they had offered at that time. Through the years this place has remained a favorite for many, as evidenced by the packed venue today. Came here today to celebrate Father's Day with my family, and also because my dad loves the maryland chicken. Was amused to learn that my dad brought my mum here frequently while they were dating long ago. We had a mixture of set menu and ala carte menu orders, with old favorites like the signature fish noodles and maryland chicken - they separate the fried fish from the soup noodles, keeping the fish nice and crispy. The spag, steak, ship combo were great too, and all were at an affordable price. Its easy to see how this place continues to be popular with Singaporeans young and old, and will continue to be part of many's memories

Took the set lunch with a friend and we shared the fried fish bee hoon and pork chop. The milky soup has just the right blend of tastes that brought out its favour. Love the noodle texture and how they separated the fish so that it isn't soggy. Pork chop is tender and juicy. Fries are done just right. Service is attentive. Reserve your table in advance -- the place was packed for a Friday lunch

Thought I'll have to write a Long elaborated post to comment on their services and food. But I decided to go concise.- waiter attending to us was impatient (i could go on and on on this point)- waiting staffs try very hard to avoid eye contact so they don't have to take your order?- orders took awhile to be served and wasn't hot.- food was really mediocre- set lunch came with bread and butter(which I supposed has been sitting beside some hot item, it was all melted)- the list goes on.I visit Singapore pretty regularly for work, nice little eateries I have been to aplenty but this is the first time I patronised this place (we were having a meeting at shaw centre) and will also be my last. I do understand that I cannot expect top notch service on a busy weekday afternoon. I don't think I'm particularly difficult and I do love to give good reviews but oh well, this kind of attitude doesn't sit well for me.I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I didn't get any tummyache after the meal

This Hainanese-owned and operated restaurant is a culinary icon in Shaw Centre and Orchard Road. While its offers a wide variety of Western cuisine, its signature fish noodles draws large numbers of regular customers. Its also my favorite eatery for this specific dish when I'm in Singapore. You have the choice of fried fish fillets or fish parts (including heads and fins). Irregardless of your choice, the fish is coated with a lightly salty and fragrant batter and fried to a golden brown crispiness. Regular customers (including me) usually go for the fish parts as they offer larger amounts of tender meat and crunchy fried bits and skin. The fish is served separately from a bowl of rice noodles. The highlight is the rich broth, made creamy from the addition of milk.This dish is available as part of the set lunch and dinner. Its very affordable at less than $14++ for the meal including a choice of beverage and dessert, and a comfortable air-conditioned dining environment. The only challenge is maintaining the frying standards and taste of the broth when the main chef is away. Make sure you check that he is in the kitchen before visiting

We had their Escargot, Oyster Mornay, U.S pork chop, Lobster set and their classic fried fish soup for a famil of 5 adults ans 1 children. Escargot is a must-try for those who like garlic (like me) Oyster Mornay bake with cheese and herbs is the ultimate comfort food on a wet sat. U.S Pork chop was average as cut was premium but it was slightly over cook as it was not as tender. love the lobster set with steak of yr choice..a must order for me. We even had a mini birthday celebration for my sister!!!!Lastly, u just got to try the Deep fried fish noodle, even my wife who hates fish taste say is good.Damage: all worth it as the ambience and service was excellent. Wait...I had lost count how long I had visited this restaurant

This establishment has been around for 30 years. Old timers come regularly for favorites like fish noodle soup. The menu is exhaustive, from steaks to local favorites, but I can;t say much more as I go just for the fish noodle soup. You can have the fish boiled or fried, and whether to add milk to your soup. That to me means the soup is not the rich fish stock that looks like milk has been added. Still it's reasonably priced and hits the spot
3
Took the kids for lunch after a hiatus while the restaurant underwent renovation. It's brighter, still buzzing- lots of nostalgic types for Sunday lunch. Set lunch still value for money for the location, even if pricier. However, the fish soup is not actually as good as the one in the food court downstairs which is half the price, has more vegetables and garnishes. The service is wanting. Six staff and no system about who covers what section. Consequently some strategic ignoring going on. Overall, think I shall wipe out this memory and think of the ones from some years past.

Ordered the fried fish noodle soup. Excellent. Set came with ice cream, wich was creamy. Coffee came with optional milk.
Great service.
5
Great place for Western and the freshness of the items served. Have visited the place about 2 years ago. No change to the food provided which was a pleasant surprise. Order the set which is reasonably priced and wide selections.
5
A very nice ambient for couple who wish to have a nice place for dinner as well a variety of very nice steak for you to chose for. a nice place for dinner.
4
Called in for lunch. Greeted and seated in seconds even though it was very busy. Had set lunch menu. Oxtail Stew to die for. Huge portions. Very reasonable prices given Singapores sometimes extortionous prices in some restaurant. Many locals dining always ago is sign.

Went to "the ship restaurant" since young at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. So glad to know that Singapore also have "the Ship Restaurant. Ambience, Food & staff servicing all are fantastic. Must try their fish soup noodle and BBQ pork ribs. Their staff very friendly to recommend their signature dishes. They have many variety of choices for valuable set meal included a soup of the day, coffee/tea and dessert(slice of cake or ice cream). Recommended to have a full set meal after or before shopping at Orchard Road

Highly recommended to all those fish soup lovers to try it at the Ship. The broth is thick with milk, and the fish slices are fried just so nicely that it is crisp on the outside and succulent in the inside. I especially like this fish soup as I do not like my fish slices to be soggy. Fish slices are served separately from the noodles
5
This great restaurant is tucked away in one corner of Shaw Centre, 3rd storey. But it's a great find! The food is good - sliced fish noodles is great. Pork chop is fantastic, especially the sauce. Prices are slightly high, but good value for money. Service and deco are alright. Great place to visit for celebrations

The Ship Restaurant & Bar has been around in Singapore for a really long time. Its a place where it invokes many memories for some Singaporeans. Eating here always remind me of my childhood in the early 1990s. Food is reasonably priced and quality of food is quite good. I would not say food is fantastic but it is worth a try if you are around the area.What really impressed me was that they were extremely accommodating to special request. As my niece has multiple allergies, finding a restaurant that is able and willing to accommodate the troublesome requests are few and far between
5
The restaurant was the choice of my company's farewell lunch, it was my first visit and I must say I am very much happy with my pick of the Fish & Chips. Fresh & yummy, value for money.However I can't say the same for the quality of service, only that hopefully it will be better on next visit
3
Ordered the fish meat noodle soup for my set lunch and my colleagues ordered fish head instead. The portion for the fish head was more. The soup was not as tasty compare to HV fish head. The service was fantastic. The servers were attentive and friendly .
3
Been there for a birthday celebration, food wise quite alot of choice from local to western delight, but taste so so, and services also slow.
5
Super yummy. Must try. Sound silly to eat fish soup in a western food restaurant, however this dish is superb.
Now in the festive season, is so popular that they still retain this dish while those western dish replace by festive one.
3
Is been decades since we dine in the ship restaurant.We were there to celebrate my granddaughter birthday. It bring back so much memory for old folks like us.Their fish noodle is still popular, but the western food prices is on par with market price not cheap anymore.The waitress that serve us was very bubbly laught most time when we tickle her. Make our evening.It was a pleasant dinning
5
The Ship used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But didn't had chance to go back for a while. Lunch there didn't disappoint. Ordered the slice fish soup noodles and pork chop set lunch. It was really delicious and not expensive. About SGD15 per person which includes dessert and coffee/tea. I preferred the darker ambience of the old ship restaurant but food wise, it was awesome. Definitely recommend the fish noodles

We came across this place today having lived in Singapore for the last 6 years - old skool English style pub with food from the eighties... And there's a reason why that style of food should remain in the past! Service is fast but the food is a little tragic and outdated - if your diet revolves around meat potatoes and two veg, this is the place for you a if you think that food should evolve and requires taste and flavour, walk on...

To satisfy our cravings for the fish noodles we re-visited this popular restaurant at Shaw Centre. Don't be misled by the quiet corridor of this Scotts Road shopping mall, this is a lively eatery and tables are often full during lunch and dinner times.We liked the fried sliced fish as it was fried to the crispy golden brown state, the meat was of the soft tenderness. We liked the soup as well - the broth was light and not "fishy" as the meat was served separately.We ordered a baked Alaska for dessert. It was a bit of a let down - the outside cream was partly charred, the ice cream not well distributed and the sponge cake a bit hard.Service was prompt and friendly. Overall it was a good meal.

Service was disappointing. I was on crutches and waiting for receptionist to get off the phone. A group came along and she promptly sat them down. They had a reservation but so did I ! They are losing a star because of this. Truly disappointed.So I don't understand why I was ignored. I don't expect to be served first just because I was on crutches but to have my queue cut by the receptionist is just way too much. Fried fish noodles in milky soup with vegetables and tomato - still good although I think it was better before the renovation.Chicken chop with cheese, tomato paste, potato, broccoli and carrots - a tad saltish

The Ship is one of the many dining anomalies you will find in Singapore - a place where it is possible to find something as western as Lobster Thermador and something as local as Fish Soup Bee Hoon on the same menu.Whilst it possible to enjoy the best of both worlds under one roof, it is probably the latter that regular diners enjoy more at The Ship. A quick reckie of diners' preference during the lunch-hour rush at the conveniently-located eaterie in the heart of Orchard Road is an overwhelming vote for the noodles in fish broth.It is not difficult to see why. The soup is full of flavour. The noodles are cooked to perfection. The restaurant also puts an interesting twist to an otherwise traditional Singapore dish - the fish is fried and served as a crisp accompaniment, rather than dunked in the broth.Other dishes are available. But as for me - in common with other loyal diners - the Fish Soup Bee Hoon wins hands down every time
5
I didn't know The Ship has been around for so long. Serving up an interesting variety of both Hainanese fish soup and Western cuisine, The Ship does not disappoint in the Western cuisine department at least. I had the prime rib (which is served on Fridays and Saturdays only) twice, no less and it was stellar on both occasions. Medium rare only, please. The service was good though they can get quite busy and reservations are strongly recommended. In addition, they let me swap my potatoes for pasta which was a huge plus for me
4
The ship best asset is their food. Extremely popular with people, service is slow as they are not able to cater to the demand but the item I ate which was the Fish Meat Soup was outstanding as it was part of the set lunch and worth every single penny. Thus although crowded, noisy during peak timing. ..one goes for the food
4
Western food, when you tire of Asian cuisine. Menu has good variety to choose from. Rate it 4.5 of 5. Service was very good.
4
I am glad they finally open again at Shaw. The food is still as good, especially the oxtail stew and the fried chicken wings. Be prepared to queue on weekdays during lunch
1
I haven't been to The Ship Rst in years and after today's lunch, I realized why... The food has gotten worse instead of better. The lobster set was such a disappointment; lobster thermidor was more mush than lobster (it was over baked too) and the meats were tasteless and under seasoned. The saving grace was their fish noodle soup but I've had better elsewhere. Looks like I won't be back anytime soon
3
Not sure why it is so popular but the restaurant is usually packed and almost every table seemed to be ordering the noodle soup with snake head fish which is part of the set lunch menu. We also ordered fish and chips from the a la carte and 2 generous portions of crispy chip in batter with fries - which was quite tasty
4
THE SHIP was originally located in ROBINSON ROAD in the early 1970s. It was a popular restaurant and bar and catered mainly to the expats then. It has two outlets now: SHAW CENTRE #03-16/18 and SERANGOON CENTE. The restaurant has recently being renovated; and is clean and quite cosy. The service is good. There are set lunch menu. The most popular dish is the fish noodle soup with the Locals. The price S$12.80++ includes coffee/tea and desserts, and is a steal ! Word of warning: this dish sells out very fast 
3
supposedly to be me and my partner's first visit to THE SHIP. however, he has already been to the one at KL. commenting that SG steak's not bad, but KL better. Will return to try others during casual dining with group of friends. Ambiance was okay. Very ideal for gatherings. Suitable for all group types
4
It was a Friday dinner with my wife. A little walk down memory lane. The complex had just been refurbished and I wasn't sure if The Ship was still in the building will all the new brand shops. Luckily for us, though some things change, others don't. We ordered the Chicken Maryland, which is one of their signature dishes and Pork Loin among other things. The food lived up to our memories and was wholesome and delicious. The old world ambience together with the pleasant and attentive service made it a wonderful experience. Good value for money. Nice place to take the family
4
Went for Thursday lunch with a regular who pre-booked the chicken rice set. I was tempted by the borscht, but went for the Chicken Maryland, which I have not seen on a menu for ages.The chicken rice looked tasty, and was by all accounts. Fortunately, I had skipped breakfast as the Chicken Maryland was would have been challenging for me otherwise. Pretty much perfectly done, and the goreng pisang was the best I have eaten.I planning to return with the family to show them what ang moh chiak used to be like before rocket, balsamic vinegar, chorizo and truffle oil.Better book, or be prepared to wait at lunchtime
5
Simply love their sliced fried fish beehoon soup. The fried fish is served separately from the beehoon soup so we can taste the best of both. The soup is tasty and fish is nicely fried. Their set meals are really good value. My daughter especially love their pork loin with aglio olio set meal. Every visit is always satisfying and we always look forward to having our meals there. One good thing is they accept reservation so no long wait even on weekends

My mom brought my husband and I to this restaurant for lunch last Sun, as she heard that it had been refurbished. We were immediately seated, and the waitress introduced us to the fruit juice avocado with honey and milk, which was not too sweet. My husband had the set menu, the borsche soup (with additional charge), the fish fillet which looked rather crispy and he said that it was not too bad, and chocolate ice cream and coffee as dessert. My mom and I had the borsche soup, and caesar salad. The beef inside the soup was cooked just nice, and tender to the touch and easy for the mouth to bite. The caesar salad, however, I would have to say, is below average. It was rather tasteless and by my mom's standard, she said that it was rather awful. I also had the escargot, so did my husband. It was cooked in French style, with onions sauce, which my husband said was perfect for dipping the bread. If you have 4 to 5 guests to invite to a restaurant with reasonable price, can definitely go to give a try in this restaurant. Likely to be back again in the near future
