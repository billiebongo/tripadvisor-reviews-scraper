We had a 3 course meal ü•ò which included a salad ü•ó, main course fish üé£ and dessert üç®.
The food taste was average and also the quantity was quite less.
Would go for the ambience but not for the food.

Visit with another couple for lunch. Not easily accessible unless you drive or take taxi/uber. The area surrounding the restaurant was beautiful with water features and greenery (actually this got nothing to do with the restaurant.) Cosy restaurant with a rustic deco. Now the food. We were hoping to try the set lunch but were told was only available on weekday. We ordered some to share. The salmon salad was refreshing. The chicken was also delicious. However the pasta was rather bland and pizza ordinary. We wanted to try the dessert but was told they are closing in 10 minutes (that's 3pm) and they have limited selection. Will probably try again if I am in the vicinity on a weekday

First the positives.... Lovely location. Surrounded by stunning gardens. They have really set the place up well for kids. Donald Duck on the projector and a small bouncy castle which is inside, which is great as poured down. It was NYE lunch when we were there and the place was busy.... to be honest too busy for the kitchen. Our food was delivered to table over a 30 min period, every person‚Äôs at a different time.... bearing in mind we only had a main course and there were just 4 of us.. not great tbh. The food was nice when it arrived.I guess it is down to constraints in kitchen but we would have loved to get some sides of vegetables etc to sample more of the produce. I love the concept of this place and will try again as hoping the issues in service were Day specific.

This is not my first time for me to organise lunch or dinner at vineyard for personal, private or official.We had a three-course meal for our office team for pre Christmas lunch celebration. We had earl grey smoked Hokkaido Sea scallops or soup as roasted celeriac veloute with confit celery and Parma ham crisp as appetizer. You choose salad as option.Main course was either honey bourbon glazed turkey breast roulade or oven roasted Atlantic halibut or vegetarian dish like parsnip and squash Tartine. All were great except turkey breast just kinda of salty as we do not like to take too salty dish. They have improved their services gradually after we have given our honest feedback to their management such as like to requisite umbrellas in the restaurant as their car park were open space. Hope they can bundle up their promotion include coffee and tea. You can choose to visit Hort Park before or after your meal.

We were going through the southern Ridges and decided to stop here to eat something. Bad choice. As said. Really slow service, frozen pizza and for that really high priced. The only good thing is the location. Quite convenient. If not needed, I won't go in again
4
We went as a group of 8 for a business lunch. Hassle free reservation, balanced menu, however a few dishes were unavailable; and they even ran out of milk when we were ordering dessert.There were some cute details though - the nice view over a pond, funny pyramid shaped tea bag and honeycomb shaped sugar for coffee. If they could fix the supply logistics, this place would be a five-star.

[The Vineyard @ Hort Park] A great place to go with friends, especially if you would like to take a casual walk around Hort Park. The food was great and the price was quite reasonable for 2 or 3 course meal. The service was good and wasn‚Äôt my first time coming here. The set mention got three options for the starter and for he mains. Must try
5
My colleague and I had to order the very tender pork chop and light yet flavourful seafood angel hair to share on our every visit because they are just so yummy. Our two dining partners also enjoyed their orders of pizza and beef dish. The place has undergone a recent renovation recently and is brighter and welcoming now. The park is especially beautiful and romantic at night.

Good to have a friend working at the nearby Google offices - otherwise I would not have known this place existed, and certainly wouldn't have spent coin on it. Which would be a shame really. Excellent service, gorgeous surrounds, delicious beers and every dish a 10 out of 10. And we had a lot of dishes. 5 white men plus 1, lots of sharing dishes and each a main. Everything was perfect. Except a lychee in an exotic martini that seemed fizzy - without question switched for 6 fresher lychees in a blink.It is too bad being poor. You could get used to this.
3
A wonderful place for the private event.This restaurant located in a park with quite romantic ambience. I had the dinner with friend without a reservation but the service was quite nice. Actually, we tried to order the signature dish such as Whole Fried Local Quail, Angus Prime Rib, Pork chop but they were sold out:( Alright, the food just normal especially all tasted very salty. Tiramisu too sweet
3
A wonderful setting at Hort Park, reasonably priced, and very good mocktails. Having said that, the food itself is mediocre. Tasteless, bland pizza. Small sized risotto. Kids brunch offers fine but limited. Still, a nice brunch place on a Sunday.
2
Thenrestaurant is very nice, friendly staf, but the Rib Eye did not meet at all the expectations and price. Fat and not nice tasting edges. Would not go there again
3
Was at the HortPark for teambonding session and we decided to head to Vineyard for team lunch. Service was quite poor and food was served very slowly. We were quite disappointed overall.
5

We had a large work dinner and found the service, food and environment very good. The location is great, surrounded by beautiful gardens and ponds.The menu was small but covered options for all and the food was well presented and well cooked. Service was also good and just the right balance of attention and distance
5
Had the set lunch menu but unfortunately only one of three choices was available on the day. However the substitutes were very good. The roast chicken was tasty with excellent mushrooms and extremely well cooked vegetables. The sea bass was exquisitely cooked, flaky and succulent on a parsnip and mash base, good garlic sauce and, again well cooked vegetables. The sparkling juices were also very good with the cucumber cocktail very refreshing. Service a touch slow but nicely done and very pleasant staff. Will go back for Brunch
5
Had a couple of friends from Canada visiting Singapore. Found this lovely place to have Sun bruch with them. The food was delicious and the service was warm and friendly.Must try:+ Mushroom eggs ben+ Grilled cajun chix sandwich++ Lemon lava cakeSpecial shout out to Joanna for being such a lovely host.Will be back again

The restaurant is located in the Visitors Centre of Hort Park and quite easily accessible even for those who do not drive. (10 minutes walk from the nearest bus stop in Alexandra Road). There is a brunch menu, set lunch and alacarte options, and the food is tasty and portions generous. There is plenty of greenery all around, which adds to the pleasure of dining in this bistro
5
The service crew has been very polite and well mannered. We ordered ribeye medium with braised beef cheeks and cocktails based on the staff recommendation. The food was not only up to expectations but also surpassing what we expected. It's definitely a place to dine if you are looking for exquisite food and cozy ambience.
5
impressed with the food, love the mushroom veloute and their pork jowl! service staff was also attentive enough, will patronise again.
5
The Best Braised Beef Cheek I've ever had. It is very tasty and paired with a merlot. Service staff were very attentive and gave the best recommendations. Will definitely come back.
5
Visited the restaurant for dinner with family and friends. Surprisingly the quality of service was impeccable and the food was excellent. After a long time, found a place which was worth recommending to others and most importantly visit again. A memorable experience. Thanks
5
A word of mouth from our relatives that vineyard is a romantic place to celebrate anniversary. so together with my wife we decided to have a dinner celebration. i'm impressed with the food and love the "char siew". The service is very warm which is above my expectation. we will be back soon together with our family
5
I've dine in at Vineyard at Hortpark last feb 24 that was friday with my family all staff was very attentive and very friendly they welcome us with a great smile although on that day i dont have reservation they still manage to help me to give a table...the staff recomend me a COD fish,ribeye,Prawn aglio olio scallop and prawn linguinni and Pizza Carnivora they are all superb and highly recomended my family and i enjoyed very much i will recomend this place to all my friends and coleagues.it's the best place to bring your loved one it's very unwiniding with a great view...it's the best place to do a corporate event,birthday babtismal and solemnization will surely comebac
5
The place was very romantic especially for couples who want to have a perfect date. My husband and I were extremely happy with the presentation of the food and the staffs were cheerful and sweet. It was nothing but a perfect magical date. I would definitely want my wedding to be there. Thank you Vineyard!

What a beautiful location for a restaurant! I had been here several times in the past, my last visit being a few years ago. With all the new restaurants to try, I had forgotten how special Vineyard is. On this occasion I revisited Vineyard on a Groupon voucher. We had a 3-course set dinner that didn't scrimp on quality & flavor. The lobster bisque was silky with small jewels of lobster. It was delicious but a trifle salty for me but this was tempered by the garlic toast it was served with. I would suggest that the toast be served on the side as eating it when floating in the bisque was a challenge!My main was the prawns with angel hair pasta that was olio aglio in style. It ranks amongst my most favourite pasta dishes. It was truly superb - the pasta was packed with flavour. The simplicity of ingredients belied the skill required to transform this dish to giddy heights (in my opinion)!We finished the meal with a slice of chocolate cake. This was rich & good but a little dry. I think a scoop of ice cream or a bit of cream would have improved its enjoyment.After this delicious meal we went for a lovely walk from Hort Park to Henderson Waves on a beautiful, balmy night. I would recommend this walk & one around Hort Park itself as something not to be missed.Definitely an experience I wish to repeat soon
3
Atmosphere though relaxing but was spoilt by noisy ambience.Not that anyone is talking loudly but poor acoustics leads to noisy surroundings.Food was little bit too salty especially the flavouring for lamb chops.Service was reasonable considering they have only 2 wait staff for the diners
5
We visited here on the CNY weekend Sunday lunch with a group of 8 adults and 4 kids, after a nice walk and some precious time in the playground, we had one amazing lunch after a very long time. The indoor sitting is quite big and spacious, best to make reservations. The best part is they have a bouncy castle for kids in the restaurant which makes this place such a hit for family with kids! The food was just awesome. Being maximum vegetarian, we still could order a lot of dishes the best was there Mushroom risotto, beetroot risotto, veg pizza salads. Not to forget. All he 4 deserts were delicious and satisfying. A must try place with a group of friends or family for quality food and soft environment
5
It located at the right of the entrance of Hortpark, nearest Mrt consider Labrador Park yet still distance away & a short walk is required from the main road. If driving, parking is sufficient. Limited seats in indoor so always remember to make a reservation call for lunch or dinner will be better choice, especially for Anniversary, Birthdays. They will do special under Chef cares. Food quality is great from main to desserts, just indulge in it for a peaceful meal. A memorable experience not to be missed
5
This is an exceptional restaurant situated amidst a splendid park environment with glorious views over the gardens.
The restaurant has a wonderful relaxed ambience and chilled atmosphere with a relatively small number of tables plus some outdoor seating.
Delicious food and charming service.

Went to Vineyard for dinner with my 2 Yo for an early dinner. There were two other tables. The wait staff was generally quite attentive. They didn't have the salmon dish so we had the beef cheek and chicken.
2
Stopped for brunch during Southern Ridges walk. Terrible service, disappointing food in both quality & presentation. Cold truffle fries with no taste of truffle. Cold bacon. Asked for ketchup, never arrived. Good location and ambience, shame it's no good.
4
The mushroom soup was good and the red wine too. The deco was pretty and bright. Pretty quiet place for dinner.
4
My lunch companion and myself opted for the 3-course set lunch at $28++. My companion chose the mushroom while I took the tuna. The soup of the day was potato and leek. It was delicious. So were the mains we had. The chocolate dessert was also very good. Coffee should have been included in the set meal. It wasn't crowded when we were there past 12.30pm. Nice park outside which we went for a casual stroll after our meal. Fortunately it only rained after we completed our walk. Very peaceful place which we enjoyed

This is not the first time I visited Hortpark but it's the first time I patronise Vineyard as I am attending a friend's wedding. Located at the right of the entrance of Hortpark, it is easy to locate although the journey to Hortpark is not that convenient as it is not near any MRT station and a short walk is required from the main road. Parking is sufficient and the parking area is probably one of the best I have since in Singapore with the use of florals.Back to the restaurant. Its quite limited in seating capacity (130+) with indoor and outdoor area so it can be quite squeezy. Decoration is ok for the restaurant theme. Food wise for the wedding buffet was served so there were salads, smoked salmon, pasta, greens, stir fried beef, mussels, mushroom soup, baked chicken, with desserts like cheesecake, chocolate mousse, cut fruits...Food quality wise its good. I particularly like the baked chicken and mussels. The cheesecake is also worth mentioning, although not sure if it was baked inhouse. Service was acceptable although there were not many service staff but they were quick and efficient. The poor sound system was really bad as it kept on buzzing during the wedding solemnisation, and that was really a turn off as what we heard throughout the whole ceremony was the bussing sound of the microphones. This was really bad

Wanted somewhere away from the city for an anniversary dinner and decided to make a reservation at Vineyard - what a right decision that was! We were warmly welcomed by hostess Michelle, whom provided us with a quiet corner and a good view of nature. She followed-up by recommending some of the restaurant‚Äôs specialties and they were truly delicious. Kudos to the Chef of the day too (sorry didn‚Äôt know your name) for your fabulous cooking despite the busy crowd that night. The mushroom soup was great and deeply loved by my wife, and the Iberian char siew cutlet was well-marinated to perfection. Lastly for dessert, nothing beat having a Classis Tiramisu with generous sprinkle of cocoa dust to make it a night to remember. I highly recommended this restaurant for diners who like us, are celebrating your anniversary with your loved one and it is also good for a great catch-up with besties. Thank you Michelle and team for your wonderful service

We visited this restaurant because if the Amex 1-1 promotion. And, the food is so delicious that we went back again. First, the surroundings is quiet on a weekday evening. it is surrounded by greenery and you can take a walk before or after dinner in the quiet park. The servers pay attention to the details and are very friendly. The restaurant deco is also very pleasing and there is a alfresco-type area for diners who like to see sunlight on their food (during the day). I love the lamb cutlets there - and you should definitely order this dish medium. It is well marinated and presented - definitely worth every penny. We are planning to go there for weekend brunch in the future!
5
The restaurant is located within a famous park in Singapore. Beautifully decorated and very spacious unlike many restaurants in Singapore. If feels like I entered into a cozy home featured in children's story book. Won't come back on a weekly basis though due to the price
1
We booked on line, got a confirmation email...turned up...no record...no seats and no where for the baby to sit anyway...looked like there were 3 staff for 100 people with people shouting at them for service. Kids area outside not covered either. Food looked terrible too.What a joke. Customer service was shocking. Terrible place. Don't waste your time
4
The restaurant is tucked away within Hort Park. The ambience is nicely cozy. The food is fine and beautifully presented. The business lunch menu is attractively priced for weekday lunches. Don't miss the lemon lava cake!
2
Don't bother with this place. Pizza was poor. It took 5 mins to get tomato sauce by the time my eggswerecold. Stay away and find somewhere else to eat.
3
We wanted to try something different for dinner and a place with nice wine. I googled and saw Vineyard. Website looks nice and they make it sound like is a wine place! Do not call Uber keying in 33 Hyderabad Road as it takes you to the back entrance. Took a while for us to find this place. Called the resto trying to find where they're as I was getting agitated but the lady on the other line Joanne was very patient and try her best to explain. We ordered Buratta (SGD 32) as starter to share. It was more a Burratina (small version) surrounded by 7 or 8 very tiny half cherry tomatoes. We were shocked by the very limited tomatoes on a large plate. Main course we'd Salmon and pasta. My pasta was over-cooked while my partner's Salmon looks great. Wine by the glass is very limited. Either house or premium wine. We tried Premium white which is not very nice, so we ordered 1 bottle of Pinot Grigio. I would not be back again as the quality of food is poor for this kind of price. Makes resto Pietrasanta looks like Michelin Star.I've to comment their 2 staff from Philippines are outstanding. Joanne and another guy (can't remember his name) are very attentive and patient
3
Service was patchy but food was actually not bad. I had the prime rib and it was cooked just right. It was a not a wagyu but it didn't matter as the meat was tender and flavourful. I also tried the pizza carnivore which actually tasted quite good. It was thin crust and they were quite generous with the cheese. The salad were fresh and tomatoes were particularly sweet. Price wise, it is not expensive and with Amex dining privileges, it is a steal. So can't complain if service was a bit patchy
5
Went here for a friend's post-ROM dinner with friends. Very private and cozy, not crowded at all. The food portions imitate fine dining, but my palette was thoroughly stimulated so no complaints there. Prices definitely reasonable for the occasion. Highly recommended for a long overdue date with your significant other or on occasion with friends and family
5
I was there to while looking for a location to host my wedding and chance upon their package online. The package was reasonable but of course i need to determine if the venue is suitable for our style and whether the food is palatable.It did not disappoint, the location is easy to find, at the entrance of hort park, and yet positioned nicely so that you will not be disturbed by traffic or people visiting the park. There are both indoor and outdoor seating depending on your mood for the day and menu comes with a very comprehensive selection of wine. I order a steak which at $28 isn't too expensive, but it was really nicely done, comparable to some of the Australian "waygu" steak in other fancier restaurants. Also ordered a Scallop And Prawn Linguine at $26, the seafood was fresh and the noodle al dente. we both ordered a cocktail each, a lobster bisque to start off the meal, a tiramisu to end off, and the total bill was still under $100 after discount. I would not consider this a cheap place to date, but at the very least i would say its worth every penny

Came here on a Sunday, at noon, for brunch. Ambience:Had to sit outside as inside was booked for a private event. Was immediately assaulted by the sound of screaming children, as there was a inflatable bouncy castle right next to my table. Nothing like reading the menu to the accompaniment of high-pitched screams. Nothing lush or green about sitting outside. It's all boarded up with black planks. There are gaps between the planks, so the sunlight streams through. Not good at noontime having to eat with the sun in your face. Luckily there were ceiling fans but this didn't help much. Was dying to get out of there after an hour, what with the heat, kids screaming and the humming from the machine keeping the castle inflated.Service:Only 1 server serving the 4 tables outside. Was alright, she was pleasant, polite and friendly. Food was slow and did not come together. We ordered 5 mains, the first 2 came within 15min. But then the next 3 came 15mins after, by which time the first 2 diners had already finished eating. Food: There is a brunch menu for Sundays, but it is very small (and the bagel and pancakes were unavailable the day we went), so luckily you can still order from the a-la-carte menu. Diner 1 - Wanted the Smoked Salmon Bagel Sandwich, but it wasn't available so he ordered the Bespoke Breakfast ($10). Opted for the wholegrain toast, again not available, so had to go with sourdough. Mediocre scrambled eggs on 1 piece of toast, with 2 measly strips of limp bacon and a huge pile of salad leaves.Diner 2 - Beef Bolognese Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($14). Very ordinary. Supposed to be brioche toasts but looked and tasted like buttered white bread. The edges weren't even buttered. Also came with a pile of salad leaves.Diner 3 - Risotto Tartufo ($24). Underwhelming blah plate of food with no truffle aroma as said in the menu. Some rice grains still hard. Basically tasted like rice with mushrooms and cream.Diner 4 - Margherita Pizza ($18). Pizza base limp, edges baked to a crisp. Bland flavour throughout, basil leaves were tasteless.Diner 5 - Roasted pork rack ($32). Yeah,,, not so much a rack, just 1 chop, really. For $32, we got 1 chop, 2 pieces of corn, a few tiny roasted spuds and a pile of salad leaves. Pork wasn't tough, but wasn't that tender either, and was pretty tasteless. I suppose they wanted you to douse it in the mustard dressing that was served alongside. Corn was sweet but old.All in all, food that is bland, boring and forgettable. Lots of other places serving way better food at the same prices. Should have walked out the minute I saw the server wearing a shirt with the "Creative Eateries" Logo

Went for lunch today. As many reviewers commented, the place was set inside HortPark surrounded lush greenery. Service was friendly but just way too slow.Food was overall average (burrata, escargot, pizza, pasta, beef cheek, risotto) and not much to write about. Probably won't be going back
4
Tucked away in the lush greenery of Hort Park, Vineyard is a lovely destination if you're in the mood for a quiet night with your significant other, or even good friends and colleagues. We came here for dinner a few days ago and didn't really expect the place to be so nice and charming. The food was good and was presented to us with a lovely plating. Hubby ordered pork and I had chicken for our mains. Both meats were tender and flavourful. I liked my salad a lot, too. The greens were fresh and crunchy and the dressing was light and tangy, with a hint of honey - just the way I like it. The chicken consomm√É¬© was good, too, and dessert was incredible! The house wine was a blah but that was the only wine they have that's available by the glass.:( In any case, it was a lovely dinner and I thought the staff were sweet and service-oriented. We didn't have any trouble from the moment we arrived up until the time that we left. Only if it weren't quite far from where we live, we'd be here quite often. We'll be back for sure.:
3
Though we had a reservation, there was some confusion between two of the staff as to our table. Once we were seated, yet another staff came to check on our reservation. There also seemed to be some confusion when it came to service. My first course was served, but I did not have any cultery. And when they brought out our main courses, they had to wait as the previous course had not been cleared away and the table was too small to accommodate the large, beautiful black plates.Foodwise, it was not bad. The first course (or amuse) was a ravioli in a creamy sauce. It was nice and flavourful, though a little hard as it had probably been cooked in advance. This was followed by two wontons filled with a fish paste, in beef broth. Once again, it was nice, though the broth could have been richer and less salty. It was a little surprising to find two pasta-related dishes in consecutive courses but I did not mind as they both had their own taste.The beef cheeks were the highlight of the meal - set within a very small circle (perhaps a larger portion in future?) of mashed potatoes, the beef was tasty and cooked till fork tender. There was a lot of arugula and three tiny heirloom tomatoes, which added a bit of zest. Dessert was cheesecake, which I enjoyed, thiugh we did find the base to be soft. The sliced tinned peaches did not add much to the dish, but the sliced strawberries gave it a contrasting tartness, which was appreciated.I ordered a iced cranberry tea, but it was exceedingly weak and there was not a hint of ginger ale, as stated in the menu. This was bad, considering the price of the drink. We also ordered a pot of Consuela grey tea, and this seemed to be the organic kind as the tea tasted 'earthy,' and gingery, and not of bergamot, as you would find in most Earl Grey beverages.With such a nice and tranquil environment and so much pleasing greenery, one would hope that they will capitalise on these to provide a better dining experience
5
I bought the groupon deal and often with such deals the service will suffer. I was pleasantly surprised by the great service attitude and more importantly by the tasty three course meal. I had the seafood soup, the risotto and the tiramisu. Excellent choice.

Located within the Hort Park, opp Gilman Barracks. My family visited the restaurant on a weekday evening. Do watch out for the parking notice abt the available car park lots outside the gated compound and the gate closing time (10pm).Given that this place is away from major offices & residences, the business has a tough job of scheduling sufficient staff to handle unexpected guest surge. Hence the numerous bad reviews abt service.However, if u are able to look thru that & keep urself entertained thru the evening, the food quality is amongst the better ones around.If the mgmt can't resolve this staff service issue, sad to say this place will not survive. Beef the service staff, built the reputation, maintain the great food and then you'll get more return guest

HortPark, a place I visit every month for its monthly Gardeners' Day Out is lovely and serene. And so basically, I'm here at this restaurant once a month for brunches or teas on weekends. Yes, it's normally busy on every visit, I thought the slow service was due to the busy weekend crowd. But..This visit was on a weekday, Wednesday to be exact. There were only 3 tables, about 12 patrons and 3 staffs. We were the last who arrived around 1:30pm. The staffs were polite to be fair but super slow service. Waited quite a while for ordering and serving. The Filipino waitress who took our orders noted 'who was taking what', and that's a plus. There were 5 in our group (including a 5years old) but long wait for the food to be served, clearly the kitchen was also understaffed. Can't help but noticed that the food came in batches for all the patrons. Eg. fish- all the patrons who ordered fish would be served; wagyu beef cheeks- likewise.We asked for extra servings of breads while waiting, very hungry. Imagine the other patrons who were there before us and served their orders at the same time as us, must be real mad..The food - lovely, very well prepared and presented as always. The wagyu beef cheek was soft and delicious, pork rack - perfect balance with the fatty part well roasted (no strange smell or taste), the signature Vineyard salad nice as usual. There's only 1 kids item-curly carbonara, al dente pasta with creamy and generous bacon. Yum...They are having weekdays promotion now (as at 4/2016) - Mon & Tue 40% off ala carte menu and 15% off for other weekdays if paying by OCBC cards. Weekdays set lunches are at affordable $ 23- 28. Visiting on weekends-I was given $30 voucher to be used on weekdays but paying by OCBC cards is a better deal.Settling of bill - quite a wait too, normally I will receive an card spending alert on my phone after I received my bill but here, I received the alert much much earlier than the bill..Parking in HortPark is easy and reasonable. Will I visit again, yes, on weekends-for their weekend brunch which my family loves.We also love their pizzas-thin crispy crust with generous toppings.And we shall practice Kungfu Panda Po's 'inner peace' while waiting...inner peace ...inner peace...good food...

Housed inconspicuously inside the Hort Park in the south western part of Singapore, this restaurant cannot be more understated. Beautiful lighting and excellent decor. There are provisions to sit outdoors in front of the pool overlooking the flower beds or indoors with a glass view. If the weather permits, I would recommend outside. They carry a fine selection of wines and will bring it to you at the specific temperature you want. The menu spoils you for choice. I was so full after a family birthday party here that I could barely move and I still wanted to have more. Try the prawn aglio olio and the mussels in truffle oil. The tiramisu for dessert shouldn't be neglected as well. The staff were ever so accommodative of all our whims. We were a party of fifteen and we never saw any part of the table being neglected. They even obliged to play some of our personal songs since it was a birthday celebration. This is truly a place where you feel that the customer does come first. This is primarily italian cuisine, so i will not be able to comment on the other dishes on the menu. Also the alcohol selection beyond wines was something I didn't pay much attention to with so much on my plate. Otherwise, this is a blind pick for any occasion. Oh and if you are driving there, be sure to note that the parking lot shuts down at 10 PM. A bummer i know, but well, you cant have it all

Been here twice in a week. We came back because we were so please at the first visit. Good service, nice atmosphere and the food we ordered was great (spinach scald and salmon for me, my wife had mushroom risotto). The second visit they had a promo, 1.2 Kg Wagyu steak for very reasonable 65S$. I was skeptical due to to the price but honestly it was a peace of meat that was one of best I had in Singapore and that is from a person been to almost all the well renowned steak restaurants. An extra eloge to Cristian Manacapu who served us.

Vineyard has excellent food - whether you eat a la carte or set lunch menu - the food is very good! the service is excellent as well - and they have great deals on credit cards (i.e. amex 40% off on Mondays and Tuesdays). particularly liked the ribeye there!
4
I've been here four times, and ordered the same dish - wagyu beef cheek on saffron rissoto. It is an amazing dish you have to try - braised beef cheeks cooked to perfection on a delicious bed of saffron rissoto with a touch of parmesan shavings. Already planning my next trip there. Have tried the apple braised beef short ribs too and they're bursting with flavour. Love the food and ambience!Also I appreciate the fact that all the food served here display a hint of the chef's artistic creativity
5
Dining at the Vineyard at Hort Park is such a delight with its impeccable service, lovely ambience amd delicious food served in decent portions. The recent 3 course dinner for 2 Groupon deal is indeed value for money. The ribs are so tender and flavourful accompanying perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts, carrots and mash potatoes. A pity the pork belly was not crispy as described. The seafood bouillabaisse is fresh and really so tasty. Loved the tiramisu with berries. I am definitely coming back for more.

I had read so many reviews about their service and was skeptical when I booked a table for brunch.Since I was with family to the Hort Park I went ahead to just try it.The bad service mentioned was non existence although the staffs seems new and most questions can't be answered, a senior guy whom I am not sure if he is the manager help to answer most of them.Atmosphere it's a small cosy place overlooking the garden and full glasses on both side. Nice place for small family lunch or couple dating.Food wise is pretty good, Italian food.The pizza is ok, nice but prices around $20The Sirloin steak marination is good but cutting not so good with many thick veins.I also had the Wagyu steak cheek risotto which I thought is soft but somehow has a strong beef smell where my wife don't really like it.The kids spaghetti is very small portion, good if your kid is very small eater.Overall it's a nice place and service was ok, not as bad as all the reviews mentioned. Maybe I was lucky.

We went there on a Sunday morning, visiting the park. This restaurant is nested within the lush surrounding that one could miss easily. I must say we came without much hype other than to fill up stomach. Grilled chicken sounded palatable and we had pasta together with a pizza.. It was awesome, chicken was a small whole bird and the grilled asparagus, brussels sprout and greens that comes with it filled up the big plate. Pizza and pasta didn't disappoint as well. Pleasantly surprised by the high standard, my stomach went into overdrive and I must say the lemon lava cake stole the limelight away. .. it did what dessert are supposed to do, leaving with a sweet memory!

We used to like this place. The new menu has limited vegetarian dishes...mostly quasi Japanese style.
The service left much to be desired. The staff was eager to clear away half eaten dishes but not so eager to actually serve.
Very disappointed.

Came on a sat afternoon and there were only a few customers. We signal to he staff for our orders to be taken but none of the staff seem to bother. After 10 mins, realise that the other tables are also waiting. Decided to leave without eating. No comments on food as i never even get to try

Recently my sister held her wedding solemnization ceremony at Hort Park so the logical choice for the dinner reception would have been Vineyard. Food was excellent. Staff were very accommodating and thoughtful. The venue is fairly small but we managed to host close to 60 guests

This is a nice quite place for a meal and to cool down after strolling round the Hort Park. The portion is quite small (I ordered the grilled Salmon) but the taste quite okay. The use of herbs and spices in the menu will either excite you or turn you off. But the view and the surrounding are excellent

Situated in the at the HortPark, the Vineyard offered fine dining with the perfect setting. You are greeted by the lovely greenery as you make your way to the restaurant. The steak was excellent and the staff was friendly enough to make our dining experience a pleasant one. I did, however, feel that the music played in the restaurant was not suited to the whole look and feel of the place

Terrible experience. We were shocked that after our first dinning experience, this time, it has turn from 5 stars to 0 star!The tapa free flow menu claim to have eight type of items on the free flow menu as below but turn out that in fact the first 4 is actually a dipping sauce. So in fact each person is paying for 4 dishes which is bread, spring roll, 2 tiny chicken dishes.Creamy chicken liver parfaitOlive tapenadeAubergine anchovyFresh bruschetta spreadHand-chopped rustic village pestoPork barbeque spring rollsKong Bao split fried wingsMarmite honey wingsService was extremely terrible. We were not pre-informed the last order was at 7.50pm. The voucher stated clearly the free flow is from 6-8pm. When we try to order again at 7.55pm, a female service staff on 19 June bluntly informed us that last order is at 7.50pm. At about 6.30pm, several of the staff started to set up their restaurant apparently for a wedding event for tomorrow. Large noise from moving the tables and chairs making us very unwelcome seemingly to implie we should get out asap!I ended up really disappointed as my husband and I has planned this evening to celebrate my birthday and we ended up felt so uncomfortable and insulted that we left the restaurant without cutting my birthday cake leaving really with bad memory caused by Vineyard Restauran

We visited the restaurant for brunch and must have chosen a bad day! One order came with b√©arnaise sauce when we had particularly asked for no sauce, two drinks did not arrive and the choice of drinks was limited as many of the drinks on the menu were not available. Two dishes were sent back as the fish was not properly cooked. The waitress told us the fish was served blue, but half of the fish was cold and uncooked and there was no mention of 'blue' on the menu. By the time this was rectified others in the party had finished their meal. Looking around, other customers were also experiencing similar problems.Members of my family had eaten here several times before and not experienced these problems but I fear their custom has now been lost

We had 1 trout, 2 vineyard club and 1 full breakfast for brunch. The portions are good for med to big eaters and the taste is alright. My biggest sore point is the coffee. We had lattes and mocha. Both taste bland and weak. The service is average. Mostly polite. They got one of our drinks wrong and were a little defensive despite that we all heard the order correctly. Total damage is about S$120. Unlikely that I will come back.

Despite some of the negative reviews we thought we would try it out last night. We were pleasantly surprised by the very good service. In fact Francis saved the night as the food was probably just above average. The lamb rack ($42) was ok (ordered MR, came out R), Prime Rib ($98) was average (ordered MR, came out M/WD. The caprice salad ($18)was nice as was the Baileys Souffl√© ($12) And we had White & red house wine ($15 each). Ambience was very good. All in all though the food doesn't match the price tag. There are better options across Singapore at that price rang

Caught out by heavy rain while on the Southern Ridges we were looking for a place to take refuge and a coffee as we reached Hort Park. We spotted Vineyard by chance and although not quite appropriately dressed for a restaurant visit we were made to feel very welcome. It was not a problem for us to just have a coffee but as we perused the menu we were tempted to take a light lunch and were not disappointed. We found the service to be excellent with both our waiter and the manager, Francis, being very attentive. The steak sandwich and meatballs with pasta both proved to be tasty and hit the spot. The nice touches of fresh baked bread while we waited for our order and the lemon and strawberry infused iced water were an added bonus. The menu was not extensive but catered for most diets and was reasonably priced for what was quite a smart venue

Was having birthday celebration and gathering of some old friends here. Very impressed of the presentation of the foods. Very quiet and cozy place, perhaps it was on weekday (Monday). The foods were delicious and service was good. We had a wonderful dinner here.

Completely surprised to find this upscale bistro in the middle of Hort Park. The food was divine: roasted beet salad, wild mushroom soup, pumpkin ravioli to name a few. These are dishes I expect to find in Sonoma CA and greedily fell upon here both because they were perfectly prepared and served and because I was so hungry for "Western food" after so many days of "Eastern cuisine". Their selection of wines is wide and varied, although, because it's Singapore, quite pricey. Reservations suggested for dinner but not so busy for lunch. Calming views into the park, which is a nice place to stroll before or after dining

In a city not known for its service (and that is putting it politely) this was probably the worst service I have had the misfortune to encountered in any city in any country ‚Äì from start to finish. Having reserved a table some weeks ago I was greeted at the door ‚Äì no wait ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt greeted at all ‚Äì there was no one front of house to welcome guests so I stood in the middle of the restaurant waiting for attention. Eventually a sullen waiter deigned to notice me and on hearing that I had reserved a table pointed at a table in the far corner. I made my own way there. When the rest of the party arrived (a minute later) and we were seated we were asked by another, younger, though equally unsmiling waiter whether we had a reservation because the table was reserved for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. I pointed out that we had been told to sit there and he asked whether we wanted to sit there. It was a confusing and extraordinary exchange. Looking round the room I would say most if not all the customers were in business attire. There was a set menu ‚Äì you could have two courses ‚Äì a couple of my friends chose Main and Dessert ‚Ä¶. My friend waited AN HOUR for her risotto. The meat part of my main course was generous and tasty (beef cheek) but the carrot batons were raw (guys, ‚Äúal dente‚Äù does not mean you don‚Äôt cook it at all) and the potatoes were cold. As a couple of us had a Starter and Main I told the waiter not to delay the desserts but to bring them as soon as possible for my friends. The older sullen waiter eventually came to give some extraordinary excuse that the desserts ordered (two different desserts) were not ‚Äúquite right‚Äù ‚Äì words to that effect, implying that they were not up to standard. He offered my friends sorbet which they refused. As we were leaving the restaurant having paid a reduced bill, we noticed that a table of 6 or 8 (all of whom had arrived after us) were eating the desserts we had ordered over an hour earlier. So I suppose if you really have to eat at this place I suggest you don a business suit (even if you are just having a walk in Hort Park) ‚Äì you may then get the food you ordered and they may even crack a smile for you. Of course no one HAS to eat at this place and I for one will not go there ever again. In the foodie capital of the world no one has to put up with sullen service, incompetence in the kitchen and ineffectual management

What a shame... Such a wonderful location but what a let down with the food.I went there to test food as we were looking for location for a wedding reception. We were the only guests that evening, so service was ok. The cold cuts platter for starters had rotten salami on it. Plus point that it was changed after we complained to staff and the second batch was fresh. The seafood pasta was a health risk with rotten squid and smelly prawns. Only plus is the decent wine list.don't bother, they wont be around for long. Either they go bust or kill a customer with their foo

Went for dinner. I can't fault the food: I was going to pick the best, but all was so good. Scallops, Short ribs (mega yummy), Wagyu steak (great), lemon lava cake (must have!). Wine was good (1200 miles NZ sauv. Blanc). You can sit inside or outside - outside has a lovely view over Hort Park: at night, nicely lit.2 people, 3 courses with wine S$330 (inc tax and service). Not cheap, but the quality was excellent. It was a quiet night, and I can see how some people might complain about the service - but it is like many places in Singapore and uses youngsters. They were attentive, if sometimes uncertain - yet very sweet. Just be patient. It was very quiet mid-week but can get crowded at the weekends.We will be back

We are a party of 4, the manager said that there is no table even when there are plenty of empty tables. He said that all are reserved. Eventually he reluctantly combined 2 tables for two. As there is an amex promotion we asked to split the bill so that we can enjoy 50% for two diners. Now he refuse to split the table and claim that it is one bill. Whatever it is, terrible service and attitude. Maybe we did not make a corporate booking. I haven't even tasted the food but we are horrified by the distasteful "service" if there was any at all. A disgrace for singapore, in the middle of such a beautiful park! Dreadful.

We went here bc we purchased the Creative Eateries voucher (you pay $50 and get $100 on food and beverage). It was truly a very good meal and experience. We ordered the tuna as an appetizer, salmon and snapper for main, and the cheese and sorbet for dessert. It was all SO good! Very pleased with the service as well. Knowledgeable and attentive staff. The wine was also super good-house wine. We got the French red and Margaret River red. Both were really nice with our meal, so we even got a third glass to split (of the Margaret River). Great location in terms of scenery and nature. Nice inside atmosphere and outside also looked comfy too. We will definitely be coming back here! (Amex Selects - 50% off food order when 2 mains are purchased)

We took our first walk across from The Interlace to Hort Park with our dog. On the way back we stopped at Vineyard and we couldn't have asked for a better lunch. The staff were very friendly and accommodating with us with our dog. We will back for sure

I have been to Hort Park once, for an event once hosted by a political party sometime ago, and it was then I discovered there was a restaurant there called Vineyard. Hence one day, we decided to give Vineyard a try, and drove up for dinner.As most restaurants in natural reserves, Vineyard is a French restaurant decorated prettily with soothing lightings within, and offers a cosy alfresco dining ambience as well, for those who prefer to dine with the wind in their faces. In fact, the restaurant looked pretty elegant from the outside, encased in glass and with dark rustic aged wood furnishings.There is also an outdoor patio area for those who wish to enjoy drinks and sit by the beautiful reflective pool, catching the first rays of sunset. This is utterly romantic and glorious.The Duck Confit is served with orzo, pickle dorange salad, dates, asparagus, foie gras and orange hoisin emulsion. While not exceedingly crispy the way I like it, the duck is tender on the inside, and tastes a lovely blend of saltiness with sweetness of the ingredients. I loved the combination of duck confit and foie gras in one dish - two of my favorite food of all time. The foie gras though, was tender but rather bland on the taste herein.The Wagyu Beef Cheeks and Mashed Potatoes - served in steaming hot pans - was divine. Meltingly soft, succulent and richly infused with the delicious aroma of marinated beef, this dish is a keeper. The mashed potatoes were a little too "liquid" for our liking though.

I am surprised by some of the negative feedback. Today was my 5th or 6th visit within a year and I have been constantly impressed by the food as well as the service. They have revamped the menu and the food was great. We enjoyed the wild mushroom salad, the smoked pork belly and the wagyu beef steak. We missed the bouillabaisse from the old menu but these new items more than made up for it. As for the service, one of the service staff, Winnie, provides impeccable service. She is friendly and gives good recommendations. I will definitely recommend a visit to the restaurant. Mondays or Tuesdays are great as the restaurant is relatively quieter

Thanks to Tim and the team for a wonderful Saturday evening. French onion soup was stunning, very sweet and topped with a great crouton! Plentiful portions of tasty food with efficient and courteous service, we'll be back!

Lots of problems one might face in this world, but a valentine's dinner at Vineyard shouldn't be one of them:1) fake rose petals on the table (really?) 2) 1hr 45 min to main course3) 4 course dinner paired with 3 flights of wine4) cheesy loud pop music in bkgd5) they encouraged the romantic atmosphere of the evening by placing tables 1 feet away - not sure what they were thinking except maximizing floorspace, but probably not repeat business6) tried asking for my credit card details by email (seriously)7) confirmed a vegetarian menu, but kept trying to serve me fish 8) had to get up to ask for water (because tables were so close, waiters probably couldn't reach us)8) and last of all - mediocre food, very small portions, for a measly $120/plateFortunately had the best company I could ask for to laugh at this establishment's attempt to be a restaurant

Enjoyed a very nice dinner here, shared entree of prawns and calamari, main course we chose the ribs and vegetarian risotto, vanilla creme carmel and chocolate fondant for desert. House pour red and white for 15 SGP per glass which was very good also. We were staying with family close by so walked to the restaurant. One of the best meals of our tri

I was there over the weekend with my partner and Vineyard surpassed my expectation. It had great warmth and care in its service and the food was just exquisite. The staff really took great care of our needs and recommended great dishes to us as it was our first time.The food was was just fantastic. My meat was cooked perfect and it was a melting with every bite. My partner loved the dessert. The hazelnut crunch bar was a perfect end to a perfect meal. Great job guys

We spotted this restaurant while walking in the Hort park some time ago.We only managed to get there lately and we were pleasantly suprised.The setting is very nice. the lamps, tables, large open windows have an irresistible charm.We were there for lunch. The carte is very appealing. All 3 courses were in nice proportion. I settled for an onion soup and pad thai. The presentation of peanuts, spices and sugar was a nice touch.The desserts were to kill for: be it the sticky date pudding or the hazelnut bar.Strongly recommend for romantic lunch date

A cosy restaurant set in the beautiful peaceful green surroundings of Hort Park. We had a great Sunday brunch - Salade Florentine is a warm spinach salad with sundried tomatoes, bacon bits, parmesan cheese and was very delicious. We had 2 flavours of pizza - salmon and the breakfast pizza. Good combination of fresh ingredients but the crust was not as crispy as we would have preferred. Brioche French Toast was an interesting mixture of sweet (honeyed French toast) and savoury (scrambled eggs, bacon).To top off the meal, we enjoyed fabulous desserts - sticky date pudding with a unique gula Melaka twist and the glorious lemon lava cake

Went there for my hubby's birthday. I made reservations way in advance requesting for a quiet table. When we reach there, the waiter who met us did not even bothered to greet us. Then when I was shown to my seat, it was a table smack right near the drinks bar, and the next table was just 0.5m away‚Ä¶ I turned to tell the waiter that I requested for a quiet table, to which he said he'll have to put me outside. Come on, dun bother to ask people for special requests, when you have NO intention of meeting it. Especially when the place was not even half filled by the time I finished dinner, on a Sat night somemore. Food was average but the bad customer experience left a sour taste. For the price, I could get better service at other restaurants. Dining is not just about the food, it's a total experience. No matter how good the food is, bad customer experience just leaves a sour taste n whatever food the customer eats will be bad

Calm, quiet and serene surroundings...at least the two times we've been there for dinner. The first time my husband and I both had the 3hrs braised beef short ribs. Loved it ! For dessert, the floating island (√Æle flottante)...not that good. Second time round, appetiser....parma ham with rock melon and shaved parmigiano cheese...yum!!! . I can only be subjective as I love the combination of melon and ham. Mains.... Mr. just had to have his braised short ribs again...I decided to try the roast rack of lamb. Delicious. Both times the bill was max 120SGD (can't remember the exact figure)...pricey but worth it in my very humble opinion.I had an issue with my credit card being double charged on the first visit, noticed it a few days later on my statement and contacted the restaurant. Wonderful Winnie got my refund all sorted out and on the next visit offered a part of our meal...on the house!! A very lovely gesture. I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for a couple of non-serious hiccups the first time...round two went pretty smooth and we did appreciate a hearty hello from one of the waiters who recognized us from the first time we came. Another plus is the background music....love, love, love, definately appropriate for couples.We'll definately be going back

Went there with partners for a business lunch. Very good location for that. It's quiet, pleasant atmosphere. You can sit inside or outdoors (with fan). The set lunch offering, a combination of Thai and French cuisine, offered a lot of choice and was reasonably priced at 28 SGD ++ for 3 courses.I can definitely recommend it for the food and the location. The service needs to be improved. Main courses were served at different times - shouldn't be for a restaurant of this type

Had lunch with a client here today, my first visit. I've never heard of HortPark, let alone this restaurant. Glad my secretary found it and will definitely be going back.Nice location near the entrance of HortPark in the Alexandria district of Singapore - so probably not a natural choice for a business lunch unless you happen to be in the area. It makes for something a litte different though.The restaurant decor is simple but elegant and the tables are well spaced out. There is a choice of ala carte and set menus. The set is fantastic value at S$28++ for three courses and offers a choice of 5-6 entrees, mains and desserts. The cuisine is fusion with a choice of Thai and French dishes.I went with Thai and had a fantastic meal - a refreshing Pomelo salad to start, a Wagyu Beef Mammasan curry which I will dream about tonight; and a fruit platter to end. All the portions were generous, the food freshly prepared using flavourful produce and nothing to complain about.Service was polished and quite efficient. Although the restaurant was 100% full including a very large group, we were well attended to.All in all, highly recommende
