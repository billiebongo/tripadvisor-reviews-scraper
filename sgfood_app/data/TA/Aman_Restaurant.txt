We stopped at this restaurant just passing by and ready for lunch. It looked like lots of the other restaurants in the hawker stalls. Our friends wanted to treat us to prat ah. We were told about another very popular prat ah place which we tried later but it didn't compare. Aman had beautiful crispy prat ah that was wonderful but it also had all of the varieties. The mutarbak was really stuffed with wonderful tasting curried mutton and all of the sauces were outstanding. There was lots of variety and everything was to perfection. We topped off the meal with "Must try triple layer" which turned out to be a black coconut sugar base followed by creamy milk and finished with dark Singapore coffee. Mix it up and it was a real treat.By the way, the prices were exceptionally reasonable. Definitely a place to look for
