Booked this place for Two reasons 1) 1 for 1 StarHub platinum club meal voucher 2) couldn’t book a table in any of my favourite restaurants for dinner (valentines day)We arrived at 1.10pm, restaurant was not that crowded but still full. We were given a nice table and we started helping ourselves with the sea food but there was no water served till 1.40pm. So I went looking for someone to ask for water and coffee (need to order), a waiter saw me looking here and there and approached me for assisting. I told him what I needed and he called in the waiter in charge of my section and informed him. We got our warm water in a few mins. Coffee didn’t arrive till I asked him again after 20 mins. So service not up to standard.The spread was not bad. Seafood section had only a few choices but it is understandable as it is lunch buffet and not dinner. The Indian food section had briyani rice() fish curry () mutter panner(peas and cottage cheese) dal curry( just average). No lamb or chicken curry but still ok.In the western food section white fish with cream sauce was good, potato on cream sauce was good too. Ended up having the two twice.Oat meal prawns were ok( nicely deveined)Deserts- the most famous durian cake was just nice and nothing more. Overall the food is average. If you ask me is it worth for the money- yes because I used a voucher , so we paid only 70$ inclusive of the gst and service charge for the two of us. That’s a good deal given the ambience of the restaurant. Will I go there again without any special offer or promotion? NOPE!!! Not for lunch. My Wife gave 4/10 for the food and service and I agree with her score ( she is usually a bit generous)

Was here to celebrate my fiancé bday and excellent customer service by Lauretta! Would definitely recommend. Love the variety of food too

Your staff Alvin --- A great employee is like a four- leaf clover; hard to find, lucky to have.--- he is such a warm person and pays attention to the customers' needs. He went all the way to be present to meet us. He is very forthcoming. We really appreciate his service and warmth rendered to us. We will be back to ypir hotel and your restaurant all over again! Not forgetting Miaohua- who tirelessly served our table amd refill our water regularly without us asking. Today is my birthday and both Alvin & Miaohua made it special! Thank you very much

Had buffet dinner here on 26-Feb-18 Fri. The restaurant was full of people with several groups having a company function there. As the restaurant was packed, the buffet line was constantly out of food and staff had difficulty replenishing the food in time. As soon as a food item was replenished, there was a mad rush from hungry diners to fill up their plates. Food quality and selection was poor compared to the last time I dined there last year. Gone were the laksa, satay, lobsters, etc. There was also not a single fish dish served as a main which was shocking. Service was non-existent as I had to clear my own plates and asked for water. For once, I still felt hungry after leaving the restaurant as there was simply not enough food at the buffet line. For the price paid, it has zero value for money. I believed the restaurant had overbooked itself than what it could actually handle. Not recommended and will not return any time soon

I would recommend to go to Aquamarine. The services and the food was amazing. I was served by the man name James. He is polite and courteous. He is one of the many in the restaurant that provide good customer service. He is one that could strike a conversation ending our dinner with a laugh. Services, food and also the ambience is a delight. thank you .

It was my first time here. We ordered Yusheng (Prosperity Toss) as it was quite near to the Lunar New Year. The Yusheng tasted real good and really fresh. The seafood was ok, freshness could be better for the losbter. it took quite sometime for them to top up the food. They had lobster, snow crab, prawns, oyster, conch, scallops, a spread of Japanese cuisine, black pepper crab and the list goes on. I was told that the menu changes every now and then but the cold seafood dish remains. Service was excellence. Price is on the high side but, this is anticipated for buffet at a five star hotel
4
Walking into the spacious restaurant, I was first attracted by the good variety of desserts. There were different cakes and nonya kueh and my personal favourite was the chocolate bread pudding and durian cake. Rainbow cake looks pretty but unfortunately not worth the calories. The sashimi was in a room of its own. The salmon is fresh and I enjoyed it. The kueh pie ti, beef and lamb are also very good!Felt variety of mains not as diverse as I wish. The cold prawns were decent. Will be good if soft drinks were included in the buffet (charged separately)
5
I had dinner here for the first time with my best friend. I heard good reviews about it so we wanna give it a try. We didn’t expect during our time here, the sweet looking Chloe was always there to make sure our dining experience was a pleasant one. Despite the peak period, she made sure the plates were cleared from our table as soon as we finished it. We were messy eaters and when we were busy choosing our food again, she would automatically clean the table up, refill our water with a big smile on her face. She also asked if she could get us hot drinks which we totally forgot about it. We really appreciate little gestures like these. She made us feel so welcome. It definitely made our day and without a doubt we would visit here again. The team were all polite and kind. A Chinese guy in a suit even made random conversation to enquire about the food and all. We wanted to have a separate bill and instantaneously Imran went on to accede to our requests and told us about the ongoing card promotions that we knew nothing about. The food was fantastic too! Overall, it was such a great experience despite the busy night yet everyone was so efficient with their work. Kudos to the team!

Had a pleasant evening at Aquamarine.
Food is great and service level is top notch in particular Gaurav who is always attentive and service oriented.
Keep up the good work.
5
Staff is very responsive, especially Mr Gaurav and food is good!
Nice selection of seafood, desserts and local food.
5
Patronised the restaurant for its weekend buffet lunch and the spread was reasonably good with a variety of seafood and asian delights. Service was exceptional and one of the servers (Laurietta) was very helpful and patient, recommending a few dishes and asking if we needed anything else
4
Nice ambience outside.Smoking area has great view.There are prayer rooms outside.Seafood & japanese section was the best.Dessert was quite good.Somehow expected more varieties but did not see it..had skipped the local dishes.Friends had chilli crab n their remarks was so so
5
I was at Aquamarine for a birthday celebrations with my family and was pleasantly surprised by the warmth and attention to detail that was shown by the staffs, especially Mr Kelvin Soh? Annabelle and the others whose names have slipped my mind, unfortunately. The buffet lunch spread had a wide variety and they were all so tentalisingly delicious! I strongly recommend Aquamarine for a gastronomical experience topped with lots of warmth and will definitely make it a point to dine there again! My sincere thanks to all at Aquamarine!

We went to this restaurant as a treat for our last night in Singapore on our family vacation. The reviews were appealing as the fresh seafood and dessert bar sounded fantastic. We didn’t have a good experience at all. When we were seated, no description or orientation to the buffet was provided, we had to wait twenty minutes to get drinks, as we worked our way through the buffet, dirty plates piled up on our table, as we had the desserts our original cutlery was returned to the table over and over again. The food wasn’t actually that great either. Our family has had MUCH better fresh seafood and sushi. We were all pretty disappointed. We waited another twenty minutes for someone to come with our bill, when no one arrived or responded to our bill gestures, I went to the restaurant reception to ask. I was told to return to my seat- and then told i must go to a bar to pay. At this point, I told the gentleman who was taking our payment that we had a poor experience. He only apologized - and didn’t enquire about our experience. This really annoyed me as well. So much could have been accomplished in a conversation at that point. I also feel quite disappointed as the buffet and hotel has such incredible potential to hit the mark - and they really were no where near it.

We came here for a buffet lunch organized by my company in appreciation of the hard work everyone put in for last year. One of the reasons we selected to have our lunch here is because the food is halal certified and we need to cater such food for our Muslim colleagues. The restaurant is located within the Marina Mandarin Hotel. We took the MRT and alighted at City Hall, walked for 10 minutes via the walkway from the MRT leading to the hotel. For those who drive, please remember that it is Marina Mandarin and not Mandarin Oriental as one of my colleagues drove to the latter hotel. Complimentary parking tickets are issued for the free parking for the first two hours and you need to pay the balance if you park more than 2 hrs. One of my colleagues remember he parked his car at the green zone but searched the whole basement car park and could not locate his car. Later, he finally found his car at the first floor green zone parking lot. Please remember which floor you park your car beside knowing the color zone and the parking lot as both floors have the same color zones.I like the ambience of the restaurant; good lighting, spacious and not crowded. The food are wide spread out. Sashimi, tuna and salmon at one stall; the laksa, angus beef, smoked duck meat, roast chicken meat and oysters concentrated at another stall; the durian mousse, chocolate cake, ice-cream, nonya delicacies and biscuits focused at another stall while curry vegetables, cooked fish, crab pincers, mussels displayed nicely on another stall. The display was neat and well decorated. The salmon, sashimi and tuna were of good grade. I particularly like the salmon which were well sliced, fresh and tasty. The angus beef was tender. I like the walnut and almond nuts which are good for the brain. The oyster was soft, slimy and delicious.But I could not find the crayfish though prawns and crab claw meat were abundant. Anyway, I am trying to abstain from too much consumption of animal proteins. Research study as in the book `China Study' shows animal protein has a detrimental effect on one's health. The service was not bad. The staff approached us if we want tea or coffee. It was then that I realized we need to order the beverages. There is a smoking area in the open air garden outside the lounge where we dine. Two of my colleagues quietly sneaked out to smoke at the garden. It is quite convenient for smokers. Overall impression is that the food are fresh and appetizing and the ambience is conducive for dining. Many of my colleagues had frequented Straits Kitchen and Carousel and I asked them to compare and they said this restaurant has nice ambience

Great service from staff, being a vegetarian they obliged to my request and provided vegetarian. Service from Gaurav was great.

Held our wedding reception at Aquamarine Marina Mandarin in August 2017.Service and food were beyond excellent. Massive thanks to Aisha who organised the entire wedding reception, and made our stay there absolutely wonderful. She is truly a gem.Our family and friends truly enjoyed the food at the reception.The variety and quality of food at Aquamarine was raved by all even months after the reception.We even have family members coming up to us asking when would the next family get together be, and if we could hold it at Aquamarine again.I have also been to Aquamarine with business partners from abroad and everyone has enjoyed the food variety.Highlights of the spread are:- Their cheese platter variety, which can on occasion include reblochon, port salut, manigodine, and others- Their frozen yoghurt station with various toppings (a hit with the kids especially)- The sushi station which serves common sushi types and delicious chawan mushi- The fresh seafood platter, a favourite for most- Salad station- Rotisserie meat stationI have dined at Aquamarine 6 times so far in the past few years, and each visit has always been impressive and satisfactory.Will definitely return

5th time here and though it seemed that the food variation was lesser this time round, the quality of the food remains the same, fresh and delicious as ever. Due to the almost last minute reservation, we got a table at the foyer, with nice ambience and less noisy, much to my surprise and liking. The staff at the foyer were attentive and cleared the dirty plates diligently but I would have to give a shout out to this young chap named Alo. He was always smiling and made us feel welcomed. His was full of zest and energy throughout the whole evening and ever ready to assist with your requests.Looking forward to the next dine-in. :
5
Had our company dinner today, the food and service is good! Would like to specially commend on the service by Gaurav who was very diligent & helpful.
5
I would like to commend Gaurav for his services. Prompt and swift. The food was also very tasty and the service by Gaurav was excellent.
5
The desert was super, the yogurt ice cream was tempting.. The staff reply promptly when I request for birthday cake for my special one. After all the food was super too... Thumps up..

I was visited to the restaurant with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The food there were really nice and out of our expectation. Thumbs up for the durian pengat and the seafood as well. Must try it out if you are a seafoods lover! A big thanks to the staff, Vivian as she has gave us her full attention even we were seated at the back of the corner (it made me felt that we didnt left out by the team) and it was a really busy night when we were there. I would like to thank her for the professional service as she really patient in explaining to us about the member card and vouchers (as i just applied for it and have no idea how to use it). We really enjoyed ourselves that night. Much appreciate for her excellent service and keep it up
5
We really enjoyed our buffet lunch here on 29 November. The display and taste of the food was very good. Some of the highlights were the fried crab cakes, halibut and durian cake. The seafood was fresh too. I enjoyed the fresh crab legs and prawns. A little disappointing was the jackfruit which was a little soggy, otherwise the fruit section was also good. The blueberries were very sweet.I like to thank the service members who served our table with a smile. Their service was attentive and prompt
5
The foods was excellent and above expectations.Enjoy coming to this restaurant. Hope to see more excellent service staff around in this hotel will continue to come with my friends to give support to the restaurant.

We did not enjoy our breakfast. Our eggs were cold and sitting out. Our coffee and tea arrived late, no table service straight away for coffee or tea. It may have been the time of morning but good service is suppose to be part of the hotel- no matter what time of day or night.
1
We had our company staff dinner here recently. On the whole, the variety of dishes and food standards were either pretty average or pretty yuck. Most dishes were bland or overcooked. The lamb and wagyu beef hard as rocks. The only saving grace were the desserts (esp durian pungat). But half of us ended up with bad food poisoning in the night after the dinner! Informed the hotel's F&B, they uttered the usual line to say they would check and see if any other customers had the same experience. Did not follow up nor offer any medical compensation. Terrible experience from a supposedly established hotel. Will not ever recommend, needless to say
5
Had our yearly classroom reunion. Good food, good company, good times and great service from Gaurav!
3
If not for the credit card 1 for 1 promotion offer the price for 1 pax is expensive. The food is just average. If you really want to have fresh seafood then this is not the place. It looks presentable but itâ€™s the quality that counts

Recently attended a weddinglunch at the Aquamarine and I must say that was one of the Best Wedding Buffet Lunch that I have had . The restaurant is halal certified and the atmosphere & setup is ideally splendid to stage such a joyous event/occasion. The buffet spread was remarkably sumptuous and every dish looked enticing. You can certainly find something appetizing in every of the internationalfood sections. My wifey and kid were drawn to the variety of desserts and the pastries/ cakessection, particularly enjoying the duriancakes, kuehs and the yogurtice cream. I was happily preparing my favorite dish at the DIY Laksa section and returning for the Biryani, poached salmon and the grilled Beef Above all, we were very impressed with the service and attention provided by the Service Staff. They were prompt and meticulous to the request of the guests. Commendably Good job! Overall, we were very happy and honored to be invited to the wedding celebration and to lunch at such an amazing place. We are still talking about the wonderful dining experience till today. I am already looking forward and planning to return for lunch and dinner in the near future.
5
I went there with my family for the first time and coudlnt get enough of the lobster and durian pudding! Special mention to one of the service crew, Garav for the help with food recommendations and his prompt service. Will definitely come back

James also sang a birthday wish song for my mum bringing the cake. he also offered to pack the cake since we were so full after the whole buffet... First class serivec!!

Came here for lunch, using a 1-for-1 promotion they had going on. Definitely more worth it than paying full price. Good selection of food and desserts, quality too. Out of the 3 different kinds of beef, only 1 was cooked perfectly, the other 2 were hard and chewy. The sashimi tasted fresh and the servers made sure to replenish it every so often. Our waiter was very friendly and made sure we having a good meal. Even going as far to get a new hot drink for my grandfather. (The drink left in the mug had cooled down over time
5
Had a buffet dinner at Aquamarine and the service was awesome! We would like to compliment Roy for being so attentive. He gave straws to my kids when he noticed that they were drinking from the cup. Thumbs up for Roy!

I am the father of the bride. We held our daughter's wedding buffet lunch at Aquamarine @ Marina Mandarin on 11/11. From our first meeting with Aisha Norwie, we were confident that she would do a good job. She made us feel at ease. She showed total commitment and dedication. She was well supported by an excellent team. The buffet spread was excellent. The ambience was warm and cosy with a beautiful external garden terrace backdrop. Thank you to Aisha and her team for making this a dream wedding event for our family

Aquamarine serves the best selection of buffet, from fresh appetizers to japanese food to european delights to sweet tantalising desserts. The place was fully booked so pls book early to avoid disappointment. Look out for the 1 for 1 buffet coupon with UOB and enjoy a good discount. Great food , good price and classy hotel, what more can u ask for ?

When I was a kid, every year my dad took our family to Singapore for family trip. We always stayed at Marina Mandarin, which left me sweet memories of my childhood with family. So this time I had a chance to visit Singapore once again. To recall those memories, I decided to get back to Marina Mandarin, but this time I tried the seafood and Middle Eastern Delights dinner buffet on my own.I wrote up an email to book a table with request of quiet corner by the window, and when I showed up, they booked a few nice tables for me so I could choose!The buffet spreads were variety and all looked yummy! I tried many things though I really enjoyed lobsters and oysters the most that I had them twice!The smoked salmon was very good too! The lebanese lamb was lovely indeed! I wish I had more rooms in my belly cause everything was so good. I managed to leave some space for my favourite cheese plate as well. Unfornately, no rooms for sweet!The service was excellent! Friendly waitpersons came around to clear dirty plates, and ask whether I need any drinks or anything.Such a pity, I had this lovely dinner alone
5
It was indeed a sumptuos and terrific dinner. This place never dissappoint me with the very inviting display of seafood bar that you wont resist, wide variety selection of main courses that you need to give yourself a second turn to get more and a delectable local sweets and cakes that complete the dinner with satisfaction and a big burp. What else to say, the staffs are really friendly and very accommodating. Jackielyn (I hope I get her name well), was superb friendly and very hardworking. She always come to our table and bussed the empty plates. She made sure to replenish our water from time to time. She shared to us the best dinner experienced. I will definitely come back again.

The buffet is nice except for the oyster. Is too bad. When you tried to use what utensil, e.g fork or spoon to take the flesh from the oyster, the flesh is just like a piece of paper, flying towards the sky. Is too thin. For the price of S$80++, is not worth it at all. If you are comparing other food in Aquamarine, is not worth the price. No doubt, we go there not specially for oyster, but as a famous restaurant in Marina Mandarin Hotel, how can they serve this type of quality of oyster.? When I tried to call the Manager in charge, he just said that in future the restaurant will not order oyster from this country anymore and will order from another country. So if I don't call to make feedback, that means the restaurant will still order the same quality of oyster. Don't they do quality assurance and service quality of the oyster before they push the food out for the consumer to consume. Will not step into this restaurant anymore. Is really not worth it and to pay for so much and yet the quality is of this grade
5
I seldom give reviews on place that I visit but every time I visit this place place, I am always delighted by your lovely ladies who helps us to have a great dinner specially Ms. Jackielyn who always greet us with a smile every time she pass by our table. She also ask if there is anything she can assist us with. The dinner is always delicious, always. And I always gain weight every time I eat here. Seafood is fresh and the other dishes are yummy as well. I always come here everytime my friends visit Singapore and this is the place I always bring them coz I know this place won't let me down. With great tasting food and very accommodating hosts and waitresses, it' s sure that you'll have a wonderful dinner.

Superb spread. Wide variety of choices. Some statons time longer to replenish tho'. Expect 20 min queue time for the sashimi and the Chef will give just a little portion (after 20 mins of queuing...it kinda' frustrating! ). Sushi selection is limited. Local desserts are awesome!
5
We enjoyed our dinner here. Staff by the name of Gaurav was very courteous and paid great attention to little details like which one of us needed hot water instead of cold. Thank you Gaurav for providing us with a pleasant dinning experience.

Ok so I don't eat fish, but that has never before deprived me of a good feast at a seafood restaurant, particularly those that advertise meat options. But the options for non fish dishes were poor, tasteless and thoughtless. The salad bar consisted of 3 types of dried out leaves, beans, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and red cabbage. All of which looks dehydrated from the over zealous AC blowing hard above.The main course options: slices of unseasoned beef in a cold gravy, chicken bones in a grey, watery broth or fatty chunks of lamb and carrots swimming in gravy sludge. All were luke warm having only the heat from a lamp to keep them hot (not).Even the pasta options were mixed with seafood. My fish eating companion enjoyed the crab and prawns but was uninticed by the fish curry, sushi and other untantalizing offerings
5
Been to Aquamarine for dinner with friends and was surprised with birthday cake aswell.as assortments of fresh seafood ..yummy ..
Thanks Mr Devendran and Co for making my day as well as to my vegetarian friend .
5
Nice food and delicious, environment very nice to chill and relax in the restaurant, definitely worth for the money that you spent 😊😊
4
First time visit to this restaurant. The food was good, wide varieties of food choices. very nice ambient too.. Super like to the customer service, and the waitress who served us (can’t remember her name, maybe Lavorita) for all her kind recommendations. Will definitely visit again for my next family gathering.
5
Booked the venue for 28 person a week back for my dad birthday yesterday. Reached aquamarine around 645pm and was greeted by Nikki with her beautiful smile, even before i reached the counter. She even remembered my name and she ushered me to my table and there, i was greeted by Alvin, who was helping me with all the arrangements. Dinner started and I met with Roslan, whom kept asking if everything was alright. I must say, it was a pleasant dinner with family and relatives. Thank you and kudos to Mr Alvin, Mr Roslan and Miss Nikki for the wonderful service rendered. I know its not easy to entertain customers but I do appreciate you all for dropping by the table and asking whether everything was ok once a while. Will be back soon. Cant wait to see what is the theme for next month. :

Aquamarine is the buffet restaurant for Marina Mandarin. I went for dinner one night after work. The service staff are very friendly but the buffet itself was a let-down. The fresh seafood was good but there other than that the restaurant just lacked imagination. The dessert bar was terrible, people were going for the self serve ice-cream as there was such little other variety
5
The food is amazing. And value for money, even staff is very polite. This is nice place to eat with family and friends and atmosphere is also very good and different types of food. I would like mention a staff name DEVEN he was very friendly and polite and the way he gave service to us. I will recommend this place to my colleagues, family and friends. Thank you so much for amazing dinner
5
I was there with several colleagues on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. While there are some empty tables, still a good lunch crowd on a weekday. This is in fact the 2nd time that I patronise this place this year for its buffet lunch and pleasantly impressed both times. They served a good lunch spread- appertisers, salads, cheese, seafood on ice, Malay section, Japanese sashimi and sushi, Indian section, Chinese section, cakes, yoghurt ice cream..I was able to find dishes that I really enjoyed and got second helping during both visits.However what impressed me most during my latest visit was the service level of the restaurant staff. From the moment I step in, I felt welcomed. As I was brought to my table, the gentleman (I didn't get his name) explained to me what they have and asked if I needed any drink to start with while I waited for my colleagues to join. When he saw that I was still alone after a while, he came by to talk to me which was a nice gesture. During lunch, the waitress Lauriette was very attentive. Not only did she introduced their various sections to us to ensure we were aware and tried the items. She also recommended us to try their buffet dinner. Such loyal and committed staff the hotel has!
5
We have company dinner once in a year. we have tried some of HALAL International Buffet Restaurant at other hotel, yet we still feel and comforatble with Aquamarine's food and service.Wide selection of seafood and most importantly, they are FRESH.Evangeline, Alvin and the team are prodive us with great service as always

I would like to compliment the assistant restaurant manager Alvin Icamen for accommodating to all our needs he's very helpful in assisting to our request.. A smile on his face will definitely attracts customer to pay a visit again

Nice food and ladies. Saw a girl with lots of tatooes finding food. What an awesome sight!!!
The black pepper crab was nice .
Seafood nice but too cold for cold diah as my fingers become too cold to use.

Recommended restaurant in my friend’s FB. Indeed, value for money and great variety of food and desserts. I love especially the durian pengat and yogurt ice cream with toppings.

Wah!!! The food is delicious and the staffs are friendly and good attitude. I will definitely come back again for the seafood and the durian pengat. Cheers to Aquamarine :)

Good food, good service, good ambience.. hosted my friends to a great lunch gathering. The restaurant staff were friendly and attentive to serve our needs. We all had a great time catching up.

Great atmosphere! Staff were fast and efficient to clear the empty plates on the table and also topping up plain water. The food was awesome especially the seafood. Recommend to people who loves seafood. Not forgetting the dessert as well

Really really pleasant experience at the restaurant. Staff were really cheerful and helpful without overdoing it. Special mention to Kelvin who reallocated our seats when he saw that we were celebrating a special occasion. The new place was fantastic and private. Cui Cui was really helpful and nice to us throughout our meal there. Extremely likable and really knows how often she should serve us without being disruptive. Food was tasty and fresh, the variety was sufficient, nothing but a really happy experience. Would recommend for a special birthday celebration :-
5
Had a great experience at the buffet restaurant. The food was replenished regularly and the quality was execellent. The wait staff was attentive and patient towards my mum and young son. Suggested drinks for them and took great care of them. The conceirge also took initiative to approach us at the restaurant to offer their assistance. Highly recommend all to try

The cold dish is amazing. The service staff are attentive and very helpful. Jerry is an outstanding staff!
5
Food is excellent! Value for money!!Really worth eating.Was impressed by the great service of the staff Imran when we first enter the restaurant. He treated us like VIP! Accommodate to our seating request and make sure we are comfortable!The rest of the serving staff never failed to check on our well being. Good Job
5
Our family of 5 was there for lunch. Served by the warm and friendly Laurietta. Will definitely come back

I just had a fabulous and wonder dinner at Aquamarine yesterday to celebrate my husband's birthday. It is not my 1st time there and in fact many times. But I hardly talked to the manager before except yesterday I need a surprise birthday cake and staffs to sing birthday song for my husband. Manager Imran did a fabulous job in getting this done secretly. And he was always around to make sure we have plates cleared, and even napkin that dropped on the floor, he would pick up and folded them nicely and placed on the chair for us. When I was to make payment, he was so nice to explain to me that the cakes and pastry near their cashier is all halal and made of fish gelatin. He is definitely one manager that does extra miles for customers. Kudos

We went to the Aquamarine based on the great food and breakfast in the Marina Club lounge and wow were we wrong. $80 per head which is already steep but then you ok this is one of the best buffets in Singapore. Well it was not. A glass of very ordinary Pinot Noir was $19 per glass. The prawns were at best just ok, the oysters were way too old, and the rest is well ordinary with the exception of the raw tuna and salmon. There are signs around saying to eat in moderation. Maybe for good reason. I could never recommend anyone visit this restaurant. It was so bad we complained to the manager who agreed to a discount. What a let down for the otherwise brilliant hotel. Lets hope as the manager said "we will discuss this at the managers meeting and make improvements
5
While staying in the hotel for a week we ate in the Aquamarine restaurant every morning and had two meals there at night.Loved the breakfast buffet.If you can't find food you enjoy here i would be very surprised. Amazing choices and of a high quality.Our evening meals were both a la carte rather than from the buffet but again lots of choice from the menu and very very good.Would we visit this restaurant again.You bet we would
2
Gave a friend her birthday treat here and regretted it. Unlike some other places, there was no live cooking stations at all. The cold seafood selection wasn't fresh and was largely tasteless, including the crayfish, scallops, 2 out of 3 types of crabs (only the Alaskan snow crab legs were sweet); prawns were just passable; the best were the oysters. The chilli crabs were inedible, with the flesh a weird off-grey color indicating that it wasn't thawed or cooked properly; we had to throw them away. Sushi was ok, so was the durian pudding. The place is frequented mainly by hotel guests it seems, and wasn't crowded even on a Sunday night. At S$70++, it just wasn't worth it. Will never return.
5
enjoyed ourselves at aquamarine. good customer service, good food but place is overly crowded and noisy.
5
Its just awesome, place to eat. With lots and lots of choice. I loved the sea food the most. Keep it up Chef

The food was superb and food spread was pretty reasonable. My hubby and I practically inhaled the cold prawns, chinese prawns in herbal broth, onsen egg with wagyu, sushi and lamb stew. Dessertwise, the nonya kuehs and pandan cake was great but not so much the factory-made local biscuits (see last pic). Service staff were very friendly and always met our requests with a warm smile. My hubby was celebrating his birthday and was surprised with a birthday song and a slice of yummy tiramisu cake.Two downsides to our visit:1. The sashimi slices and smoked duck breasts at the buffet were sliced very thickly and it took quite some effort to chew these given that these were meats which didn't taste well in thick chunks. Will like to see them in thinner slices..2. Service in clearing used plates from tables and refilling of water were very slow. The restaurant did not seem understaffed and some staff just walked past tables without clearing very obvious used plates. Nothing serious, but one would have expected better from a 5 star hotel buffet
5
The spread is just ok. The ambience is great. There's smoking corner, amazingly, which is perfect. But one little disappointment, they told me I can't bring Harry back home. Harry is a dedicated and charming young man, that pays close attention to your needs. He is a gem. Good job, Harry. We'll come back for you (the crab and durian pengat as well). Heheh
5
My family is here for my wife 30th birthday celebration. In conjunction with Aquamarine 30th Anniversary, my wife dine for free and the rest of the family got 30% off. My wife even got a birthday cake surprise served by the friendly and excellent staffs. The food spread are awesome. Will definitely come back for more. Thank you Adi and Mei Xin for the great service. Keep up the good work!!
5
Was there with my girlfriends for my belated birthday celebration. Staffs were all kind and pleasant. One of the waiter even wanted to surprise me for my birthday with a birthday cake but my gf politely declined as we were too full. Kudos to all the staff in aquamarine for the hardwork. Thank you especially to Deven who was taking care of us.

This hotel is like a city! It's huge.The rooms are wonderful and spacious and well equipped. And would you believe they give you a mobile phone which enables you to call different parts of the world - including Australia and USA and others just not Italy but hey how wonderful is that!? And not just on their WiFi but in their 3G network. How handy and fabulous to call home and to ring your partner if you get separated etc.Their third floor connects with the Marina Shopping Centre and its big enough to give you your shopping hit and other shopping is a short taxi ride away. Taxis rides are cheap. Food and drink in Singapore is a consideration so check prices as they have a plus plus policy of added on tax and more.This hotel had a fantastic pool with the best temperature water that was coolEnough to refresh in their hot and humid weather but not so cold that it took forever to plunge into!The staff were helpful and great and their breakfast varied and plentiful and tasty. It was in walking distance to the Flower Garden (night display the best) and the Light Laser Display Show which both are not to be missed. Want to go back and see these shows again.

This is my 2nd time dining @Aquamarine and it was an excellent experience. Again, I organised the company gathering after a great experience we had back in January 2017.The food selection was themed around local favorites due to the NDP celebrations in August. Notable mentions were the soft shell chilli crab, wagyu beef satay, kueh pie tee and of course their main attraction of fresh seafood varieties. A special mention goes out to Alvin and his service team for taking great care of me and my guests on this visit. Thank you
4
The place looks quite posh so you tend to see a few celebrations going on if you have dinner there. From anniversaries to birthdays, there's always a cake-cutting ceremony every few minutes. The range of food is excellent, delicious and there is even a prayer room located at the back.All these makes the place very popular with the Muslim crowd. Especially since there is very little choice in the way of a good Halal eatery. TIP: Make reservations if you are going on the weekends
5
Was there on the 26th July for my department dinner & i must the standard have improved. In fact much better than Carousel in Royal Plaza. It's not only serving halal food but amazing spread & best of all it's tasty!!! Special mention to the Chef Iskandar who patiently explaining to almost all the diners including me ,about the buffet spread & their specials. Will be back again with my 2nd group from my department & I know I won't be disappointed especially when the Chef around!!!

We were treated out for Lunch buffet at Aquamarine@Marina Mandarin By our Bosses for Treating our Internal & external Customer with TLC. Food were excellent and tasty and We had a great time, We were given quite a space; and our Bosses able to deliver their speech and presentation as tho we were the only guest there at a private function.The staff were very friendly and the waiter that serve us was very attentive and he could even recall all our drinks. The Plus Point Not only food serve were HALAL; They also provide PRAYERS room. The meals was much appreciated; knowing we don't have to rush and we could perform our prayers at our convenience
5
My husband and i went for the buffet dinner on thursday night. We were greeted with a smile upon arrival and whisked to our table without much delay. There was a wide array of food available which were both delicious and fresh. I'm grateful as the excellent and attentive service by Manager Alvin made the evening more lovely than it already was! The restaurant had a really cosy and classy ambience. Perfect for a dinner for two of us to enjoy. Loved the interactive stations. Very interesting to see the food prepared right in front of us. Special mention to Chef Jack, who was very friendly and patient, promptly answering every one of my questions about the food displayed. Very knowledgable in his line of work and efficiently handled my requests. Gave me a very good impression of the chefs working there. :) Very good service and food overall. Will definitely recommend
5
Appreciate the service of staff especially Alvin and Patel ,very attentive,patient and polite..had a wonderful evening celebrating my hubby's birthday
5
I had a business breakfast and best service by Alvin of Aquamarine. He's friendly and proactively looking after your needs. I recommend the ambiance too, peaceful, and calm (chirping birds)
1
I came here for brunch last week and got turned away by the guy at the door who said the place was fully booked. It was half empty and clearly there was space for 1 person.He then asked me if I was staying in the hotel and I said no. I had just checked out and went to the Estheva spa. He said there's nothing he can do for someone like me. I'm assuming he meant a black woman. Later I see a group of people go to the door ask for a table - said they didn't have reservations and he welcomed them in. Disgusting attitude. Management sort yourself out
5
Was having my lunch with my wife on the 27Jun 17 celebrating our 20th Wedding Anni. I must say the buffet spread was outstanding. We are spoiled for choice. The best part was your big & friendly Chef Iskandar was there to brief us about the buffet spread & recommending us the food there. It's very rare to have such a professional Chef talk & recommending us about the buffet spread especially in a 5 stars hotel like yours. Kudos to you guys for having such a splendid Chef & it does makes a difference to other buffet style restaurants or hotels. Would definitely return again for the food & the service from the Chef!
5
The breakfast buffet is awesome, everything you could possibly want is there. Staff efficient and friendly.

My grade school and high school classmate met again after 23 years in Aquamarine at the Mandarin Marina Hotel Singapore for breakfast . The breakfast buffet was wide and varied , with the Japanese , Chinese , Indian and Western corners all showcasing their signature dishes of sushi , steamed buns , chicken gyoza , vegetable curry , bacon , smoked salmon , croissant and wheat breads The most important reason for us having met here is my reunion after 23 years with a grade school and high school friend Monica . The food service was great and the waiters were attentive and helpful 
4
The Sumptious Dinner and BD celebration at Aqua Marine - International Buffet (Wagyu beef and lamb satay, fresh seafood varieties, Sushi & Sashimi and lovely cakes & pastries...esp creamy Durian dessert plus plus plus many more items we could not indulge anymore...all die die must try . (Note: if you bring outside food like your own cake -must sign indemity form ). The service is excellent from the moment you stepped in, you get warm smiles & greetings and quick service (when we go for the next round of food and return, the dirty plates are Gone
4
One of the best buffet I've had. Pretty pricey but worth it, would recommand anyone to go there during the week as it will save you some money. We went on a weekend and it cost us 188 SGD after Tax and service fees. The food was amazing and had so much variety. Everything was laid out nicely. The sashimi was super fresh! Thank you Miaohua for a nice experience, constantly checking on our table and refilling the water!Would definitely come again next time I travel to Singapore
5
Great service and good range of food for lunch buffet, we enjoyed the desserts here. It was value for money as we came with 1-for-1 promotion coupon. Special shoutout to Lauretta for her exceptional service, she always asked us if we needed refills for our drinks. Other staff were also attentive and empty plates were cleared fast. Will visit again.

Cosy ambience with good food and attentive service from staff. Worth repeat visits to try different food options.

I had breakfast. What a mistake that was. This is supposed to be 5 star. But just to get coffee, before the mad rush (I was there at around 7.30am) I had to ask at least twice, by personally getting out of my chair and looking for the people managing the coffee station. The staff are more interested in other things than serving their guests. No eye contact, just walking through their day..Then I went to get my food and the eggs were pre-cooked and so cold. What a waste of money. Had I known of such bad service and cold eggs I would have eaten somewhere else at less than half the price. Very disappointing. The raw materials were good, but the management of that restaurant needs some serious interception
5
I would just like to commend one of your staff especially Siti who served and attented to all our needs swiftly and politely. She always came around with a smile on her face and never failed to ask if we needed anything else. We would definitely like to give her a thumbs up for her excellent service!
5
The staff, Amandeep has been providing exceptional service without fail each time we visited the restaurant
5
I'm glad that I have chosen Aquamarine to celebrate my colleague's birthday ! I use the one for one UOB promotion and was delighted that it was worth the value to dine there. We were served by Laurietta. She is very kind & helpful. She attended to all our needs very quickly whenever we requested for something. She also get my colleague a small birthday cake and sang the birthday song together with us. Thank you Laurietta for the wonderful service. There was a wide range of food too. The food there was delicious ! Will recommend Aquamarine to my friends and definitely be there again !!
5
When we arrived at the hotel we are welcome by Suresh from the lobby driveway. Nadia escorted us to the restaurant with friendly gesture. The variety and quality of food is good especially the Indonesian cuisine counter the sup buntut and barbeque meat is fantastic! We were hosted by Harpreet and Amandeep during our dinner and it was exceptional! They are the assets to the hotel

Having buffet dinner at aquamarine, all the food was fresh and a special arrangement for one of my colleague birthday. Thanks to Reannie Ragno, Faam Lee Lee and lastly Amandeep and all the staff at aquamarine for the nice buffet dinner.
5
The spread of seafood and dessert was the best! i loved that the sashimi was fresh and cut right in front of me. And i was spoilt for choice for sweet cakes. I don't fancy the dishes much but the Japanese section had a great variety. Been here 4x and it only gets better each time i head over. Worth the money, totally
4
The seafood selection are good & fresh. Top up quite often. Japanese lack of variety. Desserts spread quite boring
4
Food is superb and service is excellent. We were impressed and would like to commend on the excellent service rendered by Evangeline and Raj. I would definitely come back again and recommend this to my friends . Well done Evangeline and Raj
5
We were recently at the restaurant for a buffet dinner. The spread was phenomenal and the quality of the food superb. We were impressed by the service of Ms Zhang and Mr Kelvin Soh (Asst Restaurant Manager) who made us feel very welcome. Both were very attentive to details. It really made for a very delightful experience and we will not hesitate to recommend the restaurant to our friends.Well done, Zhang and Kelvin

We went to the restaurant today for lunch. The seafoods were plentiful and fresh. Loved the laksa very much. The dessert spread is amazing. Waitress Linda who served our table was very attentive to our need and kept on checking if we needed anything. Very pleased with the service.
4
Aquamarine serves a hearty breakfast with many options. Varieties of fruits, many cereal options, eggs made the way you want, breads jams marmalades and what not. But the morning ends at 1030, wish this could be extende
5
My first time at Aquamarine with my family was memorable. Seafood was amazing, in fact all the food was beyond my expectation. (More just one or two less fresh seafood but it's fine!) Chefs were efficient in replenishing the food as soon as it runs low. Ambience was lovely. Dessert line was fantastic. Only wished I had a bigger appetite to try everything!Would like to take this opportunity to commend Amandeep. She attended to us from the moment we sat at our table. Amandeep was very polite and sweet despite being so busy. And kudos for noticing our purpose was to celebrate our Mother's love; she came with a little token and present it to my Mom. My mom was so touched and happy by Amandeep's gestures. Thank you, Aquamarine, Marina Mandarin and Amandeep for making it a day to remember! We will definitely be back again

Had an early Mother's Day celebration with my family of 11 paxs at Aquamarine on 29th April 2017 since i m working oversea. There a great variety of food in Aquamarine catering to different age group. Service is excellent with their attentive staffs. Would like to take this opportunity to thanks Mr Stewart Loh, who goes extra mile to offer me any complimentary cake (since the cake i bought was not halal) so we could have the cake cutting for the 4 mothers in the group. Thank for making our day !!
5
Great selection of food: seafood, western italian food, japanese food, chinese food, malay food, indian food, local and international sweet food, local fruits, etc. There is durian custard. My friend and I are bewildered by the selection. We spent 3 hours eating.Great service. They cleared your plate away quickly when they saw an empty one
5
Good food, fresh and delicious! Nice service, best recommend! It is located at marina mandarin hotel... buffet...
5
Been visiting Aquamarine often due to their halal spread. I must say food are always good and the staff are very friendly. But this time round it was even more better. I was serve by a staff by the name of Amandeep. Well she was very effecient in her work. Always smile, and never fail to serve other tables with with her biggest smile, friendliness and also goin to extra mile to make her guest smile and enjoy their food. There was once i remember my coffee was already cold. To my surprised, she offered to get me a new one!! Well i don't know wether this kind of service is practice else where, but this practice and service is surely something that every F&B outlets should also follow.Great job Aquamarine Marina Mandrin for having a well train staff!!! Will surely come for more.RegardsWand
5
The ambience was superb. so relaxing and the buffet variety was amazing, The staff was so polite and made my son so happy when they gave him a slice of chocolate cake. Promotion was goos and we had 2 hrs of free parking
4
Brought family down to celebrate hubby's BD. Didn't expect much as most buffet plcs usually have over rated reviews. However, we were rather suprised by the two very attentive servers who cleared our plates without us having to ask. The best part was every time when they came to clear, they were always in their sweet smiles. With good spread of food, we really enjoyed our meal. While waiting for my bill, we were surprised that the staffs actually brought out a slice of cake with candle for my hubby. Yes, when I did the booking, I did requested for a corner table and mentioned the occasion to the customer service who took my booking. But I didn't expect them to be this attentive. Now, this is what service is about. Great way to end our night and obviously hubby beamed throughout the night too.Hope the management is reading this, staffs play a great part in any business, especially the F&B line. They certainly deserved some recognition. Cheer
5
wonderful service by amandeep.. never fail to say hello to me and my wife whenever we are there... apart from crab.. the cheese pizza was awesome... looking forward to my next visit in mth of Ramadhan.. kudos to the chefs also...
4
 We were impressed by the wide spread of different cuisines and also the range of nyonya kuehs. Food was above average overall but would highly recommend the sashimi, bee hoon, nyonya chicken, and chocolate butter pudding with vanilla sauce.Service was average but can't ask more from a buffet. Overall we had a great lunch and would maybe visit again

We came here for Easter brunch with two other families because they were supposed to have fun activities for the kids. The kids activities didn't start until after 1:30pm, which anyone who actually has kids knows they aren't going to sit in their chairs for an hour to wait patiently. The food selection was limited, there wasn't even a vegetable choice, somto go with your roasted chicken ... well, no cooked veggies, sorry. For me that's a big fail in terms of menu planning. By the way, my roasted chicken was cold on the inside so it seems it wasn't freshly cooked, but precooked and incompletely reheated. We didn't know it but the restaurant is halal, so for people looking for that this is probably a good choice. For us, we were hoping to have a glass of wine or champagne, but no alcohol served. The service was not very attentive either. Overall, I just couldn't find anything to like about this restaurant and olenty of things to dislike. We will not ever go back here.
5
 Totally impressed by the meticulous and attentive service of Ms Lauretta, on top of the wide spread of quality food.I was down with bad cough and was literally croaking. Ms Lauretta regularly checked in, and took initiative to provide additional ginger and peppermint tea to soothe the throat. She also recommended other upcoming promotions , eg : Mexican spread (1-23 May 17)Her manager, Mr Kelvin, had been equally patient to attend to the miscellaneous queries from my aunty with regards to wedding package.Food wise, the sashimi and seafood were of quality cut, juicy and fresh. So were the juicy meat cuts, and overall peranakan/ international spread.Lauretta kindly offered to serve additional tea at the waiting lounge outside, as the restruarant had to close in mid afternoon. The ambience was very nice, though such initiative was even more commendable. It is quite rare be it for my business or leisure trips.Will certainly come again. Highly recommended! I came with 1 for 1 credit card promotion, so it is even more worth it. There are a couple of promotions here, so it is surely worth the shot
5
Highly impressed with the amazing spread of food and excellent service standards. Many thanks to Amandeep and team for a truly memorable culinary experience.
5
Had a great dinner. Wonderful service by amandeep. Food was great. The Environment was wonderful ..... thanks to aquamarine singapor
5
I can strongly recommend above staff for their excellent service. Thanks for their arrangement for an memorable birthday dinner.
Nice food and nice ambient too.
5
Almost 10 years we have been a regular at Aquamarine, but we have yet to meet a very friendly staff like Ms Amandeep.She has taken the extra step to know that it was my first big promotion and Husband birthday week.Great smile and service.. she ensures that we are being taken care of and indeed she made our day even more special!
5
Had a great birthday dinner with my Friend and Evangeline has a good customer service and she gave us a warmth welcome it makes me very happy. And the food variety was excellent and recommend to my friends Thanks Reds Dr Mik
5
Went for Easter lunch , excellent food and most importantly excellent service ! Linda Lee has been an excellent host to us.I will certainly recommend this place 
5
Went to Aquamarine for buffet dinner. Affordably priced at $60+ per pax and you get to eat seafood (Alaskan crabs, prawns, crayfish, mussels, oyster and the list goes on). There is a section on Indian cuisine and a section of Peranakan cuisine (on that day, it was Peranakan theme). Those who love sushi would love the sushi spread. There's also udon and chawanmushi. For Italian cuisine, pizza and baked pasta are served. Dessert is a spread of local and international delights such as kuih Lopez, kuih Dadar, egg tarts, frozen yoghurt (with an assortment of toppings). The highlight is DURIAN- durian mousse cake and pengat durian is a MUST TRY!!!' The place is usually fully booked, do call for reservation before going there. Those who drive will also be able to get a complimentary parking coupon ($3 only, you need to TOP up the remaining parking fees). Service is very good and I feel bad that each time I leave the table to grab more food, the waiter would come over to fold my napkin, again and again.... Coffee and tea are complimentary while you need to pay more for soft drinks. Words don't do the place justice. Here are some pictures to tantalising you...
5
Firstly I would like to commend a service staff by the name of Mr Devendran who had made my dinner at Aquamarine a memorable and enjoyable one. I came with my cousin and my precious baby girl. It was a dinner treat by my cousin who had her first paycheck. Mr Devendran was very attentive to my situation. Bringing an infant with pram can be challenging especially for 1st time mummy. He allocated us slightly away from the buffet counter so that I will not disrupt others and likewise. Always offering his services constantly through out my dinner time. Be it clearing of plates, offering coffee/tea and recommendations of dishes. As for the buffet spread i was spoiled for choices. Ranging from seafood, bbq meats, Japanese cuisine, Western cuisine and I happened to visit during the Thai theme cuisine. It was delicious. Not forgetting the desserts counter. Well to sum it up, it was worth every penny spend at Aquamarine.
5
It is located at the 4th level of Marina mandarin Hotel. It's a halal buffet restaurant. Throughout my 2 hours dining there, I observed that all the staff were very attentive and polite. I was very impressed after we were seated and the staff, Ms Laurietta explained to us that the food theme changes ever month and this month was Peranakan. Special mention to Ms Laurietta who gave us her undivided although she was busy serving other patrons as well. Before I left, I can't help but to approach Senior Outlet Manager Mr Rosli to express my appreciation for great services rendered. Kudos to the team of the excellent staffs. Value for money for its food and ambience. I will surely come back again.
5
Visit this exceptional restaurant and enjoy a variety of delicacies. The beautiful environment and quality of service will always make you come for more. Enjoy ur meal..

We just visited Aquamarine to have a sumptuous dinner with my colleagues because we wanted to celebrate my Promotion at work and it was indeed a good place to have a great dinner with friends and colleagues. The buffet spread is really has a wide variety of range to choose from. One of your lovely employee explained that it is Peranakan theme and that they change the theme every month. I searched what Peranakan means and understand what it is all about. The food really is upto level where your taste bud would really work to taste every flavor of it. It really is Peranakanish inspired food after all, so delicious. Great food that came with greater service. The lovely lady who assisted us to our table is really sweet and very helpful and answers all our questions about the food and all. She's such a good person to see before you have your meal, she can enlighten up your moos and feel great. Thank you for delighting our lovely little celebration over a great dinner.

Food was great and up to expectation for promotional price paid. Special mention to Soo Im for her ever-ready to serve attitude. We were seated in a corner and we were never neglected in any way. My friend and I had a great timing dining at aquamarine. Keep up the good work
5
So much choice. I really recommend the Nasi Lemak and curries. Plenty of fresh fruit and tasty pastries too. Friendly service from Lauretta.
5
Cool place for a buffet with attentive and quick-footed staff. Plates were cleared constantly and food was replenished regularly too. Would recommend for any large group events.
3
Not much variety and choices for the price paid. Not much staples. Chef carrying food refills spilt water onto the floor without realising, causing slipping hazards to guests. Waiting staffs were very attentive especially Ms Amandeep, who attended to us during our dinner.
5
As regular patrons of Aquamarine, we are delighted that the restaurant continues to live up to its name of providing great food and great service. Special mention to Rachel Bong and Deep for being attentive to our needs as well as going the extra mile. Kudos and keep up the good work.

This was the first time i visited for lunch with my family. The food was great, the service staffs are very polite and well disciplined. Furthermore i would like to mention about the staff Mr. Raj we had a great service from him and another i would like to share the way he explained about the promotion going on in the hotel both food and card discount

Our second visit at the restaurant on 1 Apr 17. Our choice to celebrate my boy birthday as we love the wide spread of good foods. The foods were replenished rather fast. The staff was friendly and super attentive! We r especially impressed by two of the crews - Mr Vikram - I just asked for a candle so that I could have it on a slice of cake to celebrate my son birthday. He returned with his colleagues together with a candle on a slice of cake and birthday song for my boy. Awesome! Big thanks!Mr Razak - beyond the attentiveness and friendliness we expect from service staff, he guided my 7 yr old boy to handle his piece of beef and seafood. My boys like him a lot! Big thanks too

This is my first time here with my colleagues for dinner. Great food, The service staffs are polite and well manner especially Mr. vickram, when we reached at our reserved table, that time we were waiting of staff for serving water.But until 5 minutes no body attended to us. Your staff vick... came and asked to us about warm water, cool water. We told to him, no need.. But he gave the offer of hot water, coffee and tea with innocently. But he didn't know the last situation. Then my dinner spoon was dropped by mistake when he was obtaining the spoon then i felt he was not fine..but i didn't ask to him anything.. He came again and offer soft drinks. We ordered mango juice and sprite.. After that we realized that we were VIP in your. Aquamarine!!!! ..I appreciate the attention when we need help about the items. Other, the food were super delicious especially the durian pengat and yogurt icecream! Wide spread of food such as seafood, pastries, salad, Asian cuisine etc.The ambience of vicinity was great too. There were many different kinds of pastries. In the last, your aquamarine staff present the birthday cake and sing a song very loudly. we gave surprised to our friend..she was very happy and capture selfy with your staff. Thanks vick..

The service is nice and the staff explain to us for the buffet and the peranakan dishes is also great, the most impressive thing is all the staffs are outstanding for the sevice. when we all seated the staff came to pour water for us immediately and they r all kind doing service for us. And the beverage surprised me also compared with other buffet restaurants, thanks to the staff Adi for the tasting hot chocolates and the service

My preferred restaurant to meet clients for lunch. We enjoyed the selection at the buffet which was Thai themed. It was the service that we were so impressed with, from the greetings at the entrance to the service team, everyone was professional and personable, especially Stewart and Laurietta, whose special touches made a difference. Chef Tuck Wai came by to say hello and made some light starters for us to sample. We will be back again for sure
5
Again, I came to visit this time for my birthday celebration treated by my wife.... on 27 march for dinner.... Aquamarine staff, environment, food, services, PERFECT! 5 stars from my family.... I have visited this place last month for my wife birthday celebration, and we really enjoy it, this month we come back as no other choices can beat aquamarine. SO our choices will keep to aquamarine. Book 2 weeks earlier and a particular table that we want, and they personally reserve it till we come.. we are so happy.... We were again greeted with so much sincerity from the staff... tip top service. We felt like a VVIp in there.. haha.. Staff was super vigiliant, looking at the customer which finish eating and helping to clear the plates asap so that they can take the next meal. this is very2 good. as, u dun need to keep calling the staff.. Last month, A staff name of Vickram serve us, and I orderd from him a hot chocolate from him.. surprisingly, when this time round, he purposely did another one without me telling and serve me.. this is very good as the staff are well trained to see what the customer expectation, beside then that, another staff name , Isabel, she is very polite, and fast and responsive and alert whatt was going around when the place is quite busy. Lastly, My dear wife has planned with the staff there to have a surprise birthday cake, After I was full eating with 6 rounds, with desert, Yes.. come to talk about the desert, people who come here should try the yougurt ice cream, its definetly way nicer then... L_o L_o . dun want to say the brand...haha after desert have finish came up a birthday cake planned by my wife, and all of them sing happily for me.. was shy abit though as a lot people looking.. but. who cares... my wife already plan for it...

Its my dad's first dinner at a hotel. He was quite impressed by how the staff greeted and served us. We had a wonderful evening together. Free slice of cake! The managers were very helpful to coordinate the cakecutting.Ps: the servers, Vikram and Siti, you guys are the best
5
Stretch of great food/ halal that will spoil you at an affordable price. Staff extended exceptional service and accommodate to your needs. A special thanks to Jay, Miaohua(Aquamarine staff) and Hambali for your superb recommendation. 2 names that deserve a good pat at the back. Great job Aquamarine and staff of Marina Mandarin

We had dinner with friends to cater to many different dietary requirements and were pleased with the variety of food and the service. The variety of sashimi was limited, but there was a lot of other seafood options available including freshly shucked oysters, slipper lobster, crab etc. A large variety of cooked foods was also available including, Thai, Indian, and Western dishes. I think everyone in our group was able to find something to suit their taste. The restaurant felt clean, modern and not too noisy so we were able to catch up and have an enjoyable evening
5
We had our lunch at Aquamarine on 27 March as it is my husband birthday. We were suprised by the Thai food theme, the food was extremely delicious. We were served by the staff Nik, his PR skills is really good. From the buffet spread to suggested places to visit (as we are foreigners), we really enjoyed the conversation. He came by our tables often just to check on us whether everything is ok or not. Suprisingly, we were served a slice of cake with a birthday song, i did'nt even requested for it. Me and my husband were satisfied with the service provided. Thank you Nik..

I stayed at the Marina Mandarin on business and ate here most days. It was friendly and consistently good with great variety. Well worth a look!
5
We had our lunch at Aquamarine for the first time, me and my family was impressed by the buffet spread and satisfied with the service provided. When we were seated at our table, the staff immediately offered to pour water to our glass. As we were trying to figure out where to start as it was our first visit here, the staff Nik came to greet us and patiently explain to us about the buffet spread. We manage to try almost all the food, the quality was fantastic. The service was no doubt, Excellent. The team that was guide by Nik was very well organized and efficient. My family was satisfied and will definately return again..
5
The service staffs are polite and well manner especially Nabilah , I appreciate the attention when we need help about the items. And she's lovely and charming is she single? And sometime I get distracted bc she sooo cute! Other than that the food were super delicious especially the durian pengat! Great job I will come to visit aquamarine again (: - Landa

A must-go for all seafood lover! Remarkable cold seafood counter with huge snow claw crab. Every section is worth a visit to whet your appetite – Indian, Japanese, Thai, BBQ, bread, pasta, salad & dessert. Cosy ambiance. Loved it! Thanks to Jackielyn for the impeccable service.

Aquamarine is considered among the best buffet restaurants in Singapore. Unlimited choices and one of best sea food restaurants. Alaskan Crab was nice ,fresh and very delicious.Slipper Lobster and Scampi so far the best i ever tried . They serve also different kind of fresh sashimi and each one of them is tasty and delicious.There were so many other dishes , desserts and fruits and i guess Aquamarine is one of the rarest restaurants that can satisfy every customers preference.Dinner 21. 3. 201

The service here is excellent by the staff members and the different kind of Asian food display and the taste is wonderful.Thank you for the excellent service and the delicious food.

Food & service are tip top, excellent. Chefs & staffs keep ensuring that we try all the foods. Good service especially Mr. VIKRAM who attended to us the whole time., from start to the end. He is very attentive to all our needs. He is proactive and offered to help us to take photos and anticipate our needs. PS: My mama said he is very handsom

Wide spread of food such as seafood, pastries, salad, Asian cuisine etc. The service was great as the restaurant's staffs responded to our requests promptly & they were friendly & polite. The ambience was great too. The Chicken Rice & Durian Mousse were very tasty too. There were many different kinds of pastries & it is a must try if you were to dine there! :

Food variety for lunch buffet is satisfying. Great service by Ms Laurietta and team. Kudos! Appreciate for their attention when we request for additional item
5
Aquamarine has one of the best seafood spread in Singapore. From fresh cold prawns to crabs to oysters to crayfish. Service by the staff is very polite, attentive without being too intrusive. Special mention must be given to the Assistant Restaurant Manager Miss Rachel Bong for going that extra mile. She is professional, friendly, courteous and very approachable. It's the Thai Food promotion. Some suggestions. The beef noodles section will be great if there is a chef "live station". The tom yum goong soup has room for improvement, it is not "flavourful" and authentic enough.Dessert section and japanese section is great. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the food there especially on weekdays as it is not too crowded
3
We went there recently for Buffet Dinner and were disappointed by the food variety and partly quality. Some of the items seems from cheep quality or outsourced suppliers but don't fit in 5Star Hotel category. Recommended revamp of Menu to bring up quality and standard to 5 star level
5
It was my wife birthday on 18 march. This is the 2nd time we are here. we are so happy celebrating there.

It was my wife's birthday dinner treat so we decided to dine at Aquamarine. We and my parents in law were served by this excellent, patient, extremely pleasant and patient waiter, by the name of Vikram. We felt very attended to, would just like to feedback our compliment to the management at Aquamarine of having such awesome staffs. Keep up the great service and standard.

Good spread of Halal buffet for lunch or dinner. There are always seasonal theme for the buffet. It is value for money for the food.The food are excellent especially their seafood buffet and theme buffet. The ambience of the restaurant and the services are excellent
5
We had my niece's birthday lunch at Aquamarine over the CNY long weekend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The team at lunch made my niece feel really special with a (pre-arranged) surprise birthday cake and song. The cutest touch was when the manager stepped forward, wished her "Happy Birthday" and shook her hand. She felt like such a grown-up and could not stop gushing about how everyone knew her name at the restaurant :)So a big huge thank you to the staff of Aquamarine for the wonderful experience. You really made an eight-year-old's day :) We will be back very soon!Best,Trici

I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your outstanding professionalism and warm hospitality we received during my company (CAAS) dinner at Aquamarine on 19/1/2017. It was a celebratory evening to share the unit’s work & success in 2016, as well as confirmation of new staff into the unit. Thank you FAAM Lee Lee and her dining reservations team for assisting to confirm the reservations as well as the various requests that came along, such as the changes to Pax numbers, L&S dining vouchers to be used etc. Thank you Jay and his team at Aquamarine for the great evening. The service staff were very polite and helpful, highly attentive and prompt.There was a lady that greeted me on arrival(Unfortunate that I couldn’t recall her name). She was very attentive to my queries on seating as well as the other arrangements that were required for the evening, eg. Wine requests, voucher queries as well as the options available to add on for the dinner ie. Softdrinks/juices. She patiently explained everything I had asked and left me a very positive impression. As they say, “You never get a second chance to make a good first impression” I wanted you all to know that my bosses & colleagues were very pleased with the excellent quality of food and wide selection of dishes available. We had a wonderful evening, and I believe you managed to WoW my colleagues who dined for the first time at Aquamarine. Once again, a very big Thank you for the wonderful evening

I went with my Friend to have their buffet dinner ...when I reached the restaurant I need to wait for 15 min near the hostess area..n there was no one to talk ..after 10min I approached a server who told me that someone will come to us in a short while ..then one manger come to ask us about our reservation...he was very kind n helpful ..the hostess later show us the table ..no buffer Orientation was offered ..the spread was good n of good selection..I like the Indian section ..wish there was some Indian bread ...only coffee n soft drinks were included in the buffet ..over all a good experience except the beginning part .. thanks for the experience.
5
Went for the Christmas Special buffet. The food were superbly delicious and service was good despite the busy period. Worth the money spent. Special would be the seafood even though I'm not a seafood person

Dear Client Services Representatives,I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received at Mandarin Orchard last Saturday.Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind. I am impressed by the service Marina Mandarin has provided especially the customer service relation ladies who greeted and assisted us around the hotel facilities. They are warm, eloquent and are immaculately dressed in their oriental attire.This was not all, my family and I had an unforgettable experience when we dined at your restaurant, Aquamarine. This was not made possible without the assistance of your colleague who goes by the name of Mr Nik.Mr Nik made us felt special with his professional hospitality skills. He attended to all our needs throughout our dinner and even went an extra mile by preparing us luke warm water for my little child's milk preparation. At interval timings, he will come to us to ensure that if we need any assistance he will be of a great help. Mr Nik even asked for a feedback on the food and how can they improve their food and also services. In all, he is a good communicator, a good listener and professional.As I continue my dinner, I observe that the restaurant is very well taken care, both in terms of hygiene and aesthetic. I kept observing that Mr Nik and his team were always on their toes setting up the table cutlery and ensuring that the area is always kept clean and tidy. I must say im also impressed by the placing of the bishop on the dining table. The bishops were neatly folded and looks sharp in presentation. As a Gold member of the GHA hotels alliance, I must say, the services you have provided for me and my family have met more than I have expected. Your team has scintillate the image of Marina Mandarin to where it belongs, a true international standard hotel. I am more than glad to inform you that Marina Mandarin and Aquamarine will be among the lists of recommended hotels that I will introduce to family, friends and future clients.Yours Sincerely,Ibrahim Fergo Junaidi

Ate 1 breakfast on 3 night stay. Poor: coffee, bread, pastries.Fruits scarce & not fresh. Way too expensive: SG $ 94 for 
5
Went there for Christmas brunch for first time, it really exceeded our expectation. The setup was very festive, stylish and charming. And the food - just amazing. The selections beats that of other brunch coming with a much higher price tag. And they are all well prepared and presented. The seafood are quite fresh, and meat like lamb shank, beef wellington, duck breast all succulently roasted, the Christmas deserts are curious, delicate and tasty. Local cuisine is also served at good quality. We really had a very enjoyable meal
5
Beautiful foodSeafood buffet dinner simply awesome and the breakfast buffet is outstanding.Customer service satisfaction Guaranteed thanks to Chris she has been very helpful also with local information on our stay here. Salama
5
This was my 2nd visit to the restaurant. We were there early, but the service staff still entertained us and allowed us to proceed into the restaurant. Excellent menu with fresh Japanese sushi and sashimi. Cold section was also good. The wait staffs were prompt in topping up food that run out fast, like oysters and snow crabs. Overall, the spread is good and food is fresh. Really enjoyed the fresh sashimi and also Vietnamese Beef Noodles
4
My wife and I went to aquamarine for Christmas dinner and we had a good evening. The variety and quality of the spread was awesome,especially the shellfish. Dessert was pretty average though. Still a good night out.
1
I wanted to experience the dinner and the stay that many of my friends and colleagues have raved about endlessly so I managed to book a 3 days 2 nights stay over the Christmas break, with the Christmas dinner over at Aquamarine as the highlight of the stay.Unfortunately, the first experience with the restaurant/hotel was so bad, it might have left a bitter taste in my mouth. I was told that I needed to head down to pay the dinner in full in order to book the Christmas dinner. If this was inconvenient, they shared this form where I can fill up my credit card details and provide them with a copy of my credit card and they can assist to book the dinner for me.I enquired on other payment methods as I was uncomfortable with divulging my credit card details: providing them with a copy of my credit card just to secure a reservation for dinner. While I understand the need for full payment, I had hoped for Aquamarine to be more flexible since I had informed them that I will be staying over at Marina Mandarin and the dinner can be paid for when I check into the hotel on the 24th. Staff was adamant and told me to either head down to make full payment or forfeit the reservation. Sent emails to implore them to make some concessions for me since I was quite tied up with work and could not afford to head down in person. No reply.Again, since I was told that the service and the food were impeccable, I headed down but was informed by the manager that since I had booked a stay with Marina Mandarin, I did not have to make full payment in person. I had just wasted 2 hours of my time dealing with this restaurant. Terrible experience, and the food/service was not even worth all the trouble. Painful lesson learnt
5
Been here several times with family and friends on other months and the quality of food always good to my expectation. Love the wide spread .... And oh oh the durian cake and durian paste ( they called it durian pengat which I think not the correct name) everyone should try. It's marvellous
5
Great service and great food. The servers were very and approchable. Ms. Mariecris Alfonso, especially, was very helpful and friendly
5
Good location, Good food and must say big thank you for being helpful esp. Rosemary. her service is Tip Top. Thank you again
4
Dine in to celebrate my gf birthday. The suprise that was plan was well excuted by Edward and this chinese tall lady. The seafood spread was great quality. There is this gentleman kept on comin and share about the membership that was offered. I just find that he was trying to force us to sign up for the membership and kept bugging us. He rlly annoys me very much.
3
Prices more highly than most other halal places, I was thoroughly disappointed with the spread and quality of the buffet. Service was good but the food was a let down.There wasn't a single item on the menu that had the 'ump' factor.Too much hype on the durian dessert 
5
A shout out to all the service crew and Chefs at Aquamarine for all the lovely service and delicious food! Suitable for family gathering, couples and birthday celebrations! It's my second time here and I love it, the service crew is always so friendly, service is good and they always have fresh seafood! Love it and will definitely come back again for another special occasion!!
5
Nice restaurant. Food variety is good. Indian and western food are very delicious. Desserts are very nice with frozen yogurt as the main highlight. The only downside is the sushi... very bad choice of rice and not well cooked. Sashimi could be fresher. But overall, i have a good dining experience. 
5
We visited Aquamarine and had a very pleasant experience. Not only was the seafood fresh and the beef tasty, but the durian dessert certainly did not disappoint us. To top it off, the service staff were very friendly. Vikram in particular was very proactive and helpful in assisting us throughout our dinner. He was never rude in his interactions with us but always wore a friendly smile whenever he served us, which contributed to our dining experience being a pleasant one. Aquamarine is now definitely one of my family's favourite buffet restaurants
4
My family and I went to Aquamarine to celebrate the birthdays of two of my family members. Your service staff, Vikram and a few others went out of the way to accommodate to our request for a birthday cake and even sang us a birthday song to celebrate this joyous occassion. Special thanks to them for making it a memorable celebration :
5
2 friends & I came for buffet at Aqua Marine on Friday, 2 Dec & we are very impressed with the fantastic service provided by Vikram. Because of his warm personality & attentiveness, we enjoyed our dinner. Looking forward to going back again. Well done Vikram!!!
5
Went to Aquamarine for a weekend lunch. The interior decors were nice and the lighting not too sharp. The staff' were very attentive and friendly. There was a wide selection of cooked food, seafood, sushi, fruits and pastries. We like the old school butter cream cake most! The foods were adequately replaced once the portion was low. The whole cake however was replaced with different cakes and we didn't get to sample the cakes that we missed.A suggestion over here. Some food does not properly labelled with food name, while some food name does not indicate what kind of meat was. Hope can have better name labelling so that can help eaters to identify food that they can consume
5
Had birthday buffet dinner for 2. The spread was great! Prawn n crab was very fresh and huge. Love the chocolate bread pudding! Coffee could have been better though..Sadly there was no discount if you were to stay at Marina Mandarin itself. Should have collaborate with the hotel for customers who are staying here..Sitting area huge and staffs are great
4
Great spread for seafood lovers! Relaxing ambience, nice place to eat and chit chat! Variety display for desserts especially tiramisu!! Love it! Tad bit pricy but good for special occasions!
5
Our dinner in the restaurant was so great, large variety of foods to choose from. My favorite section was the seafood area where u can get the fresh seafood items :) but, the warm welcome from the staff as we enter the restaurant and the good services that they provided us made our dinner perfect. Cant wait it to share it with my other friends to try :)
5
I have orgainsed a company event for 70-80 pax at Aquamarine @ Marina Mandarin today. Aquarmarine was able to provide a section of the restaurant to be cordoned off and turn it to private room for function. This enabled the guests to enjoy the buffet served in the cafÃ©, and at the same time enjoying the privacy. The restaurant staff are responsive, and they provide all assistance in ensuring smooth running of the event. They are also very helpful, polite and they attend to all requests with prompt attention.The buffet spread is marvellous with variety of food selection. The seafood and sashimi are very fresh, all other food are well cooked and served. There is also a good selection of dessert too. I would highly recommend dinning or hosting an event at Aquamarine
4
I love all the fresh seafood at Aquamarine! I personally feel that there is no other hotel restaurant that can actually beat the freshness of the seafood at Aquamarine. On top of that, the staff at the restaurant were all so ever helpful. Dirty plates get cleared almost instantly and the service was very prompt. I highly recommend this to all the seafood lovers! Thank you Aquamarine for the great service and food
4
Good selection of food available during the breakfast buffet. Decent food, nothing that really stood out. Service was prompt
3
Went with 1 for 1 credit card discount for buffet lunch. Spread is decent and I highly recommend the slow braised beef oyster blade as well as the cheese platter. However, layout of the buffet area can get confusing as there are more options available in another linked room (depending on where you are seated). Service staff are friendly and fast to assist
5
What I like most about Aquamarine? The STAFF! The SPREAD!Would like to drop a note of thanks to Mr Alvin for planning Nikita's bday so beautifully. When she least expected.... the cake came and all the staff were singing birthday song so heartily and Kevin (or Kelvin?) use his DEEP voice to enhance the birthday song! How innovative! Alvin is regularly checking with us if we are okay and comfortable. His warm hospitality made all so happy and satisfied. I will surely return to Aquamarine!
5
Oh my gooossshhh! If you're craving it, this place has it! It is pricy but the quality was well worth it. We received 5 star service from the hostess, Eva, to our server, Chloe, she who was so friendly! There were so many selections of dishes from Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, Vietnam and so on. Only regret was not having a bite of the fresh BBQ because I was so full- it's cooked outdoors because of the smoke. All you can eat lobster... yes please! The chili crab and you dip the bread roll on the sauce - yummmm! Would definitely go back and recommend to family and friends!
5
As usual, the food selection was excellent and the quality/ presentation were good/ exquisite. Staff were attentive and courteous. Special mention to Nik, Julie and Rachel who went out of their way to make the dining experience memorable.
4
First of all, this would not be my style, but thats just me! About 10 colleagues wanted a casual style easy dinner with guest of various err "beliefs" from all corners of the globe. So on that front it was a good choice, its a good quality multi choice buffet style place. Thai, Indian, vegetarian and a rather good sushi counter. Friendly attentive staff too. Rather good in fact, I would say it would make a good family occasion type place on a weekend, or a group celebration
5
Had a delicious treats with wide selection of cuisines...
Enjoyed every savour of food in my mouth...
Will definitely visit again...
5
you have to try this, its quality and veriity is superb. The fish options are out of this world, !!!
5
The sea food buffet was amazing, some fish I had never heard of. but very tasty. Breakfast buffet also very very good.
5
Very happy with the service of Mr Jay from aquamarine restaurantHe nvr fail to smile His service is excellentHe make our lunch a very memorable day indeedWill defenitely come back for more lunch or dinner at Aquamarine spore!keep up the gd job MrJa
5
Went here for our lunch date, it's our ladies day out...The food selection is the greatest, so hard to choose which my favourite, but the fresh salmon is my TOP list. Our memorable moment when the Asst Mgr (Jay) came to our table and making sure that our meals are to our satisfaction. He offer and suggested few dishes for us to try. And of coz we try them out... He not only have the good knowledge on the food selection, he gave good recommendations. Stella on his service. We are sure to return back and looking forward for his friendly and stella service.

This nice restaurant is part of the Marina Mandarin and is where breakfast is served each morning but also is a nice middle of the road restaurant in the evenings with either a la carte or buffet dining. The buffet is actually quite good especially for seafood and main dishes with the choice of western or Asian cuisine. It is not especially romantic but very functional, comfortable and efficient. Deserts are not a forte as in most Asian restaurants. You can have table wine but it is quite expensive. The value of the food offerings however is quite good. All in all a nice place for in house dining if you are staying at the Marina Mandarin and do not wish to venture further
5
my family was very impressed with the variety of food served here. So much so that we plan to have my younger brother's birthday celebration to be here next month. Service was really good also. My dad especially would like to say his thanks to your wonderful staff Ms. Isabel and her other co worker Lixian for doing a wonderful job serving us and other tables as well, even thou we came a bit late and the place was quite full. Not only we left your restaurant full, but very happy as well
5
We celebrating our 1st company Annual dinner at AquaMarine buffet restaurant on 23rd Sept 2016. The food and service are super awesome. We enjoying ourselves till almost 11pm. On behalf of our company, i would like to say A"Big Thanks" to the awesome service from waitress Ms Kimmy and waiter Mr Nik Mikael, who has been served us with a big smile, and fulfilled our request without letting us down.. Highly recommended this restaurant for those who love cuisine food & fresh seafood. Cheers!!.

The buffet spread is rather extensive but prefer quality than quantity.Nothing special or unique compared with others.If no credit card promotion not value for money.But service is good and the staffs are attentive.The place is always crowded and noisy so not a fine place to dine and relax

Awesome food and ambience. Attentive and excellent service from the staffs and restaurant manager. Highly recommended

I would like to say up front that Wedding Dinner was awesome and a huge success!After searching and evaluating a number of restaurants in Singapore, we decided to hold my daughter’s wedding dinner at Aquamarine @ Marina Mandarin. The service provided by Aquamarine is superb especially with the help of Aisha and Rosli who help us plan and execute the wedding dinner. Aisha contributed and bounce ideas and suggestions that help make the dinner a memorable experience for our guests. She tirelessly coordinated with the decorators, chefs, service staff, hotel facilities and many other details to ensure the wedding dinner runs smoothly. The buffet dinner of more than 80 items consisting of a wide variety of seafood, Japanese food, live station of Rotisserie and Grilled meat, a whole roast baby lamb, salads, local food favorites of chicken rice, roasted duck, salted egg and black pepper crab, noodles, traditional kueh, rojak, etc. Wide selection of desserts, there’s just too many for me to list here. They even provided vegetarian food for some of my guests who are vegetarian.Here’s a sampling of the feedback from my guest: “The best wedding I had ever been to”, “the food are so scrumptious”, “I have a hard time to choose which should I go for seconds or third”, “the food, ambience, deco and service is superb, well done! Best wedding for us this year or even last 2 years”, “very good food with a wide variety of selection”, this coming from a fussy eater who happens to be a cook himself and rarely give such comments. All guests that I asked for feedback say that the food, the ambience, deco and are staff are excellent!My family would like to take this opportunity to thank Aisha, Rosli, Zul, the service staffs, the chefs and the hotel for providing the best experience that my guests had ever experience. You guys had done a great job, well done!! Last and not least thank you Joji from Jentayu for the beautiful dais and decorations

Brought my colleagues for our yearly dinner at Aquamarine and again received great service and hospitality from the AQ team namely Rosli, Zulkifly and Rachel. Excellent service & wide selection of food. AQ will always remain my top choice for gatherings. Truly a great representation of asian grace, warmth & care ~~ Jocast

I visited Aquamarine with my family during our visit to Singapore and we had lunch. The food was nice and atmosphere was friendly as well. Our family table was served by Mr. Nik and he did a great job. He was attentive and clearing our plates constantly. We were served perfectly by him and we would like to thank Mr. Nik for that! We will be visiting sometime soon.
5
This was my second time to visit Aquamarine,the Buffet spread was amazingly delicious and wide variety to choose from... fresh seafood ,satay ,pizza ,indian food , dessert and many many more....... love it !! Staff was pretty awesome and we definitely will come back again
5
It was my mom's birthday celebration and we had looked forward to having dinner here as this is one of our family's favourite restaurant. The spread is amazing as always - Japanese, Indian, Italian, Singaporean, Peranakan dishes etc and a great cold seafood spread (oysters, crayfish, prawns, alaskan crabs, clams, mussels) and a wide dessert and fruit section. My mom also have a slice of birthday cake with the staff singing a happy birthday song to her. Needless to say, quality food in a lovely environment, our family left the restaurant very satisfied and look forward to returning again

Was full of excitement to try this new place with my family. However was disappointed upon the arrival at 12:30 approx with most of the buffet items empty. I know it must have been the crowd that make the turnover bad. However would expect that they knew about the size of the crowd with the reservations and booking. In the end time past and I wasn't in the mood to have a good meal because most the items are topped up too slowly. The other factor must have been the promotion that cause the in balance. If that's the case I would really implore that they top up the good fast. Also to my surprise I ordered coffee and they came not hot and neither too warm. The food was actually mediocre that does not warrant the price tag. Would be hard for me to come again. The experience was acceptable because of the helpful staffs. Then again the thoughtfulness of the food content has to be re looked again as I was like at a good court with many locally delights and they are not top notch. Gap for a high rated hotel in Singapore
5
Had a wonderful time at aquamarine! It's my second time here and decided to bring along my whole family this time round to try the good buffet served. My mom love the durian pengat so much. The food is delicious too.. Definitely coming back again for our next family gathering or anniversary! And The staff is friendly and polite tooo.. Thumbs up for the awesome hospitality and service..
5
With more restaurants being halal, we have more choices.Aquamarine at Marina Mandarin is the place where you can have fresh and succulent seafood non - stop because the staff refills the buffet spread quite promptly.The sushi counter, with the tempura, is another of its highlights
5
Great buffet spread for quality halal seafood buffet. A little on the pricey side, but it was worth it. Quality of food and the staff was really nice, efficient and helpful! One in particular had a great smile and was helpful although I cant remember her name. There was so much food, that one of my friends felt a bit sick after eating so much
5
The freshness of the seafood and sashimi is something that was really good. The staff also replenished the food very quickly. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
5
This is my second visit to Aquamarine and the sumptuous cuisine especially the varieties of seafood on display make us craving for more. The prompt and excellent service makes me wanting more by making a future booking with Aquamarine. We were being greeted with bright warmth smile by Mr Rosli whom had guided us to the window seats as requested in our earlier booking. The night went on flawless with the excellent food and services being rendered. Kudos to Mr Rosli with his passion and commitment in making a night to remember for both of us. Without doubt, I would not hesitate to promote Aquamarine to all my friends and contact. Well Done

I had called conceirge and request from staff named syahirah and seek assistance to have a happy birthday surprise in the room for my lovely husband birthday..and its a wowww... im impressed the layout pf the room and have a small cupcake which presented by the hotel.. thanks for the help and kudos to marina mandarin to have a wonderful staf

We chose this restaurant to be part of our 1st wedding anniversary celebration. And we had great experience here.Wide range of food selection and of course delicious. Staffs are very professional specially, Ms. Evangeline. All my gimmicks(surprises) for my wife were perfectly executed with full cooperation from the staffs. I may say, EXCELLENT!!!After our dinner at Aquamarine, we will definitely recommend this restaurant in all of our friends and relatives.Keep up the good work Aquamarine, 2 thumbs up!!
5
My friends and i love to try other buffet restaurants. We were really glad that we went to aquamarine. Food was really delicious and they constantly refill it. Even thou it was busy, the service staff were excellent! especially Ms. Isabel. She would constantly fold our napkins,clear the plates and refill our water. What made her standout is her genuine smile and being helpful to the needs of other guests as well. Hope you would commend her and the other staffs for her excellent service
5
The buffet spread is really wide and sumptuous! Ambience is great and perfect. I would like to especially thank Mr Zul for his friendly and warm service, from the moment he greeted us at the entrance. I requested for a birthday cake for the birthday and was pleasantly suprised when Mr Zul served the cake without me reminding, unlike several experience at other restaurants. Thanks again and will definitely come back here again for future celebrations!
5
Awesome food with wonderful ambience! Great Location! The service was superb. Friendly and helpful waiter. Special mentioned to Mr Zul for always being accommodating with our request. Great experience! A+
5
We dined with some friends and we have enjoyed the sumptuous choices of food specially those seafood on ice. Service crews are punctilious and friendly. Highly recommende
5
the place is pretty clean and neat. great location. the food is fresh and tasty. service waiter are friendly and helpful. great experience
5
The buffet spread is so sumptuous and i would say that it really fills my stomach upto its maximum capacity... The food was really great specially the seafood part. When it comes to service, i would like to thank Ms. Jackielyn for her wonderful hospitality. She greeted us with her very pleasant smile by the time we approach her. She guided us to our seats and bid us to have a great dinner. A wonderful way to start our dinner... The dinner went well while other staffs are consistently refilling our glasses of water. The place has a great atmosphere... It's all worth the price you pay for
5
Was here with some of my friends and were quite indecisive about dining here or other restaurants. We made up our mind and settled for Aquamarine and I really couldn't ask for more. The staffs were friendly and greeted us and catered to our needs. The food is awesome and everyone is enjoying themselves in the restaurant. As compared to other restaurants I've been to in other hotels, I honestly say Aquamarine has one of the best food and service in town. Thumbs up and keep up the good work!!!

"My family and I planned an early birthday dinner for my brother at Aquamarine Marina Mandarin Hotel and we were glad we chose them. The ambience of the restaurant was perfect for us. Service staffs were all smiles with a friendly deposition. I would also like to highlight that they were all very attentive to our needs throughout the dinner. Our family were very satisfied with all the dishes from cold and hot dishes to dessert, kudos to the chef(s)! We were even surprised with a slice of birthday cake for my brother which was very beautifully designed. Birthday song was sang by the service crew and Manager.Thank you to all for this wonderful and memorable experience! Keep up the good work
5
Dine in Aquamarine with my husband. We love the staff and the variaties of food on the buffet. It does not taste like any buffet food. It was like ala carte dishes fresh from the kitchen. Nice tasty and hot. The seafood on ice are also very very fresh. Yum Yu
5
The staffs were very attentive, polite and everything ran very smoothly. Everyone was well attended by the staffs and they were always on hand to ensure everyone's glass was always full. Thank you Manager & the staffs of the day for the surprise birthday song and as per my request of the complimentary cake to given to my fiance. He had a great time dining and enjoy his birthday cake.We enjoyed the dinner last night and we will definitely come back soon.Thank You

This is my 2nd time visiting this restaurant, this time round is a company lunch on a weekday.The restaurant is located on the 4th floor of the hotel. The signboard is not obvious as there are a few restaurants adjacent to each other so one may miss the restaurant for the first time.The restaurant is spacious and clean. Food are available at the main section as well as in the side section (Japanese and Chinese cruisine).Variety is considered limited although sufficient. The cold seafood are fresh. The prawns, prawn salad and smoked salmon are recommended. I don't have a very strong stomach and I usually will have stomach upset if the food are not fresh but I am perfectly fine this time round. The crabs, scallops, mussels can be avoided as they are nothing to rave about. Sorry to disappoint but there are no lobsters or oysters for the lunchCooked food section is pretty good. There is a BBQ section which is recommended. The variety is quite limited though. Curry dishes are nice.The Japanese section is quite boring except for the sashimi which is really fresh. Just some random sushi and that's about it.The Chinese section is also quite boring. I skipped that totally.The desserts have a good variety of cakes, including rainbow cakes! The almond cake and warm chocolate pudding are must try. Cheese cake is quite good and the coconut cake is worth trying for those who like their cake very rich. There are also fruits and a yogurt soft serve machine. Don't recall seeing any fondue. A nice cup of coffee completes the meal.Service is good as the staff are very prompt in clearing the used plates. Thats probably also because the restaurant is not crowded.I would have given it 4 stars if not for the price which is on the high side.
5
As usual, the service and good food never fail to impress me and my friends. Its one of the best halal restaurant around. The variety and sumptuous spread is what we always come back for. The staff is very attentive and always around to render help whenever needed. Zulkifly is very helpful too.Food is fresh and never need to wait for replenishment.Will definately be back

I was at the wedding on the 23rd of July. I must, the decor, the ambience, the feel-good-factor was very obvious. Marina Mandarin totally outdone themselves. Food was lovely, the mood was awesome, the service is class. Everyone in the dining table was obviously having a hell of a time. It was truly great and also would like to thank your team to make it a wonderful day for US and Especially my close friend, the groom. 3 cheers for Marina Mandarin Team, HiP HIP Hooray.. Hip Hip Hooray.. Hip Hip Hooray
5
It was a last minute as my partner and I were very busy and we got a very tight schedule so we just decided to go for buffet dinner for our anniversary, though we plan to go for holiday next month. It was indeed a good choice to have it at aquamarine at marina mandarin as it caters variety of foods. A choices of local dishes and western foods + a very delightful seafood bar and sushi counters made the dinner sumptuous and very much memorable. Not to mention the very accommodating staff at the front of the house Jackielyn who assisted us to our table and even looking after us even the busy period. Nik who is always come to our table to clear our empty dishes lure us to try some other dishes which we enjoyed very much. My partner and I were very impressed of their cheerful and outgoing personality. I always hope that company values them as much as possible. We are looking forward for another visit.
5
Had a bad day at work before went for a dinner apptm with my friends.My mood changed when all of our enquiries are met,from the place they seated us,the ushering to our tables etc.... The team led by Mr Zul during that time.The food was awesome too.Thumbs up for Aquamarin
5
First of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank Marina Mandarin Aquamarine Staffs who work really hard to make my wedding a memorable and unforgettable one. Especially to my wedding planner Ms Aisha, Mr Rosli and Mr Zulkifly and all the staffs who put in extra effort on our wedding. All of my guests were very happy with the wide selection of delicious fresh seafood serves with a touch of western fusion with local and international spread with reasonable pricing for dining or wedding. Food were freshly serves and it will never disappoint anyone.. Service were very attentive, impeccable and definetly personalise. Everyone of the staffs pays special attention to my guests needs. With my internal great fullness I wanna said thank you so very much from the bottom of heart from me and my husband for making our wedding an awesome one. I would recommend AquaMarine to all guests internationally and locally that it's an exceptionally more then a 5star rating from me.

We had a birthday celebration at Aquamarine. Great spread available, something for everyone. Nice fresh seafood/sashimi available. Very good variety of cooked food and desserts as well. We were there for Sunday lunch, and there were balloons for the children, nice touch
5
If you're a big fan of sea foods, then Aquamarine at Marina Mandarin is the place to be. they offer a great array of sea shells from scallops, clams and oysters, to a variety of lobsters, shrimps, crabs and a whole lot more.They don't just offer sea foods but a great choices of Japanese and western cuisines as well.Great Service and helpful staff also. Two thumbs up
4
Welcome to AquaMarine, I like you the food with Local Laksa, Japanese Shushi,Seafood,Salad Bar, Dessert ,Hainan Chicken Rice..Well organised. Even though the temp staff ,but they did good job. Always attend t9 us for table cleaning etc, plate cleaning
5
Came for the lunch buffet and could not get enough of the seafood and sashimi! I had only a bit of the local fare, but they were superb as well. The staff are always ready to clear your plates and serve coffee/tea. One downside was that the drinks were limited to coffee/tea/water
5
We were impressed with the variety of food presentation (importantly halal), very friendly & professional service by the restaurant team especially by Steward. Service staff were helpful & very attentive. Would highly recommend my friends & relatives to come again
5
Food spread is simply awesome,the service rendered are also excellent .. Great n friendly staffs .. Would like to thank Zulkifly for his great service n warm assistance whenever I need help. Thank yo
5
Very good mix of food, good quality too! Staff very attentive and constantly at your service. Their lunch promotion deal was awesome, 1 for 1 on certain credit cards and that just made it worth it! Considering the food spread and quality was top notch, it was very good, ate alot and have alot to work off now! Def, go for a lunch and go with a group, its a nice venue. In fact, we are thinking of making our family lunch meets here, every month, good on the price and good on the taste

Don't get me wrong, I think the food in Aquamarine is actually really good. If my review was based solely on the food, I'd give it four stars but here's where it lost one star. Ambience - Too much going on. There were different stations for food which was good because they were able to prevent long lines of patrons but I think capitalizing on the volume of patrons compromised the whole ambience. Service - There was a lack of camaraderie amongst the service staff. They looked pretty divided and there was no communication. We sometimes had overlapping service, or no service at all. Food - I have no complaints about the food but it takes a long while to get replenished. I had to ask twice for the cheese to be replenished but gave up waiting in the end. The selection was pretty good though. I was there for dinner and again the next day for breakfast but I wondered if the food was fresh because the Indian selection was exactly what I had for dinner the night before. Price - It's pretty pricey (SGD 80++ for dinner per person) and I'm not sure it was worth it. Overall, I still think Aquamarine is one of the top 3 Halal buffets in Singapore. Will definitely head there again.
5
Had family lunch on weekend , we were sitting at the lounge area. The lounge ambience was gorgeous. Food variety though limited, but it offers one of the best cooked food. The service was excellent as the staff always clearing our used plates and topped up our water, the two Chinese staff Ghim Guan and Jia Qi. Overall a wonderful weekend for all of us , will be back to expect more food variety and this kind of service in the visit
5
This is the best dining experience I had for a long time. Great food and especially great service. My family and I had the pleasure to be carefully taken care by one of the crew, Mr Balan. He took a great extend to meet the needs of my family, especially my 2yr old daughter. My wife commented that he has a really warm smile, which is great for service line. I am a very patron for his top notch service. And food! Good job
5
Was here before and the variety and the taste of all the food and dishes are getting from better to excellent each time. I will be back here again. A Must Go for everyone!!
5
Had my solemnization and buffet dinner at aquamarine in marina mandarin and it was fabulous. The setting of the salubrious private dining room could not have been any better with everything, literally everything provided for. Savoury international cuisines coupled with delightful desserts satisfy even the most critical tastebuds. Keen servers were attentive to all our needs and always carry a smile on their face making everyone feeling welcome, excellent service no less. Special thanks to Aisha, the one who helped create a memorable night for me. She guided us through the entire process with her extensive knowledge of the wedding custom or else we would be at a lost of what to do. Great wedding planner, top notch five stars services. All of my guests had a wonderful time with feedback of pleasant experiences with the place. Well done team Aquamarine!

I have heard a lot about the restaurant and had looked forward to dine there at the end of my staycation at Marina Mandarin. However, there was nothing but disappointment.Firstly, for a price of $60++ per pax, there weren't a good variety of cuisines / dishes to choose from. Of course it might just be my luck that the menu for the day was as such. I roamed all the stations and realised that the selection was only as good as what you probably will get from those budget buffet restaurants. Secondly, the freshness of the seafood station was also below what you would expect of a restaurant in a 5-star hotel. I have only managed to try the prawns (because the restaurant was very packed) and I must say, I could get fresher prawns from my neighbourhood food stalls.I did not try most of the other items because it was a total turn-off at the restaurant. So i thought, desserts should not go wrong right? I was wrong, so very wrong. While there was good selection for desserts, the only commendable one was the blueberry yuzu mousse and dark and white chocolate cake. My partner tried the DIY ice-kacang and man, those syrups and ingredients when mixed, tasted like longkang (drain / sewage) water. My partner actually only added those syrup and ingredients that you would normally have in the ice-kacang you have at foodcourts etc. I tried the atap-chee and am not sure if I am glad that it is quite tasteless.This will be the first and last time we would patronize the restaurant, although the staff were pretty much professional despite the rowdiness in the restaurant.So to all buffet lovers, do not spend your time and quota on this
5
Came there for dinner to celebrate Mom birthday. Buffet spread was good..! In love with the oysters!! The Services is good and server were very friendly! I can't really recall his name, but what I can said is that, his a Chinese guy and using a spectacle.. We even request for a table at the lobby area, they did not decline our request. Definitely will come back again.
5
Went there for dinner with my family and it was a wonderful experience with excellent service and amazing food. Enough said!
4
celebrated my sons's birthday at this restaurant. it was quite busy but we enjoy our dinner. Food was a lot. we like the dessert especially the durian! The lady in front of the restaurant was friendly and the staff named ' Isabelle' ( sorry if wronf spelt) was very kind and attentive.while give our presents to our son, she surprised him with a slice of cake with candle! even thou we did not inform any staff that their was a birthday celebration. will definitely recommend this halal restaurant
5
Went to aquamarine to break fast. The food was fantastic. Definitely will come back. The staff were helpful and polite, especially Kelvin and Alvi
5
On 22th june i got came to aquamarine for dinner with my family. The dinner buffet was really awesome. My child was enjoying the pasta and nasi goreng. Specially the durian penyet was to lovely. The staff name KUMAR was to helpful and always keep our table clean by clearing the plate's. And he also make my husband happy by serving a slice of cake for his birthday. One more thing is the billing time JULIE was so kindful by settle our bills
2
The seafood available here are very cold and bland. Sashimi only have 2-3 varieties. Cooked food taste so so. If you do not eat spicy food then the food variety narrows down by 1/4. Dessert wise is so so also. Nothing special.
4
Sakura chain is my favorite but we went to Aquamarine to celebrate my husband's 33rd birthday, it was amazing! I loved all the cold food especially yummilicious crab and sushi spread. Dessert was nice too. The rest delicious as well. It was quite pack when we were there for dinner so make sure you have reservations and be there on time or else you will have to wait for another table. They had 2 small cabin like area for male and female just outside the restaurant as Musolla so its easy for Muslims to pray. You'll have to take your ablutions inside the hotel toilet though. Ambience is nice, clean I give Aquamarine total point of 8/10 
5
My boy friend chose Aquamarine as dinner venue for my birthday.Initially I thought that this is just typical family buffet I have seen many times and didn`t expect much. However, their excellence in service really changed the whole point of view and I am willing to go back there again.Their seafood section was absolutely awesome.Although I am not a big fan of oysters, the ones at Aquamarine are very fresh and even sweet!The problem was that we arrived there at 9pm+ due to work so I only got to eat one leftover oyster.The staff called Nik approached us and asked whether everything was ok and I told him that I really enjoyed the oyster but could only have one(As a joke and didn`t ask for anything nor expected anything from him)He immediately went to the kitchen and passed me one plate of oyster and smiled at us.He service was really extraordinary and I believe he really represents Aquamarine in a positive way. I would like to thank Nik for taking my birthday experience to the next level:
5
Families gathering lunch recommended by relatives,impress the service here by staffs greeting and smiling.A Manager who wearing glasses name Stewart, he walk around to give out the balloon to those kids in restaurant include our kids with friendly style + chatting and play with kids.Really feeling great with the service here.Sure with recommend to other & come back again
4
I stayed at Meritus Mandarin Hotel very recently wherein this restaurant is located. I liked how my omelette turned out and it was the highlight of my breakfast. The other choices were just average. However, the food they serve is Halal so this is a good choice for those looking for Halal breakfast
5
This is my first time here with my colleagues for dinner. Great food. Excellent service. I would love to come again if the opportunity arises
5
We planned a nice romantic dinner but it turned out to be night of gluttony culinary delights. We LOVED the soft and succulent cuts of prime wagyu beef. Cutting through the soft shells of the Alaskan crab to reveal the fresh and sweet sweet pink meat within. Oh... to dip the flesh into the different salivating sauces .Ohhh... the sushi was nice too. It was a gastronomical experience worth getting our elbows dirty for. The service ? We literally had a personal waiter who waited at our table ! Wow!!! Nik was such a helpful chap providing us with info that we needed to plan for our next food binging group event. Good place . Good atmoshere. Good food
5
Excellent service with wide variety of delicious food Great ambience and value for money. Fresh seafood and a diverse mixed of Asian food served.
5
I have been to many buffets and I must say that this is my first buffet with free flow of super tasty Wagyu beef!!! I love their Wagyu beef and lamb steaks! The beef is juicy and not over cooked. The texture is just right and not too hard. I must say it is the best beef steak I ever had! The service was superb! The crew change our plates frequently and they are all very friendly, especially the chief crew. He asked how was our food and we told him we are very happy with the food. Desserts are very nice too! I seldom eat a lot of dessert during a buffet but I had a lot of desserts at Aquamarine because they are all very nice!! I am very satisfied with the service and food there. I will come back for more!
5
The good is tasty with generous servings of everything! Crabs, prawns, scallops and even freshly cut sashimi slices. An indulging experience, a relaxing atmosphere, and a great team of service staff (did I mention Alvin the good looking captain?).A must try and must go for families and businesses
5
Not my first time dining at Aquamarine, and it definitely won't be my last. The first restaurant that comes to mind when celebrating a special occasion. The vast selection of food is always exquisite - the wagyu beef a firm favourite for the night - and the service provided by the everyone there has always been beyond remarkable. On that particular dinner, we were closely looked after by Alvin Icamen, who was really friendly and provided us with such excellent customer service, totally making everyone feel as comfortable as possible. Another totally satisfying experience
5
Very nice place, delicious seafood especially the chilli crab. Service was good despite a crowded evening. The manager who attended to us Alvin made the evening wonderful for all of us
5
Wide range of food to choose from. From Sashimi to local chicken rice to fresh seafood. The meat section is really good. The roast wayu beef is a must try! Good service too
1
The seafood section is terrible. No taste at all. The other food is below average. Not worth the price
5
Heaven for fresh seafood lover. Fresh and high quality seafood are here. Alaskan crab, French conch..you name it.The price is also quite make sense.On top of the fresh seafood, they also provide good choice of modern and traditional dessert
5
First time dining in at Aquamarine for my husband birthday yesterday. Great staff service by Ghim Guan. Always clearing our tables and top up our drinks. Seemed like he's the only staff doing that to our table probably because he's incharge of our area. He deserve a recognition. Both me and husband really like his service. Great food and nice ambience. Will love to come back
3
This is the first time I been to Aquamarine, thanks to my company.I don't really got much food since I'm busy having fun and chat with colleagues. But food wise, it's good. Replenish often I suggest because everytime I wanna get oysters, it's gone. Was hoping for much more choice. Service wise, it was alright
3
First time dining. Quite an interesting spread. Seats were comfortable, great ambience... Was excited to taste the food... but quite disappointed with the quality of the food when its actually a 5 star hotel dinner buffet. Seafood spread was OK. Guess I'm paying just for eating in a nice space. Food I enjoyed were only the cakes and wagyu beef. Average quality, premium price
5
It was my first time dining here (lunch buffet) & I had a good experience. Food selection was vast and they even had a separate Japanese section. There were lobsters, crabs, salmon, miso soup, sushi, soba, etc. The desserts were also appetising as well! The bread pudding with vanilla sauce was sweet but really good! & my personal favourite had to be the frozen yogurt machine with endless toppings at the side for you to choose. Staff were attentive & friendly, & ambience was relaxing and warm. :
5
I visited this place again cause of the previous good experience and if you are searching for a good restaurant ,this is the one of the place...The buffet they served was absolutely tasty and in a very hight quality.Plus,if you a muslim searching for halal restaurant,this is also the place for you.The food here are so variety.I just cant get enough with the food and I also wished I had a bigger stomach.The ambience are also a plus.Would love to come back if I staying in this hotel next time. The Chef came to our table to get some comments on thier spread and food spead and the malay captain was very attentive. Lastly the King crab was BIG and TASTY. Chicken rice was nice also. Absolutely delightful

Thought we'd eat here after looking at some very glowing reviews of the buffet option, only to be disappointed by the average quality. Also, the service and table clearing did not live up to expectations. Enough said, it's popular with many so they must be doing something right
5
This is my first visit to Aquamarine Restaurant @ Marina Mandarin Hotel which recommended by friends. Hotel environment was good with friendly service. I remembered the manager named Mr Stewart was very ambiance and the service staffs named Leslie and Deven was friendly & funny. Its make us have a wonderful gathering in the restaurant. I will recommend to friends and visit again.Well done !!!!
4
Went there for my birthday during dinner. Lots of variety local and international cuisine. Ambience and surrounding were very peaceful. Buffet foods were regularly top up. Staffs surprise me with a piece of cake. Really caught me off guard. Nice gesture. Will definitely dine here again with family and colleagues
4
A fair priced seafood buffet that serves a fantastic range of hot and cold seafood that is very fresh. If you are lucky enough to be there for the served tuna it is amazing, a highlight of my meal. For those not wanting seafood there are plenty of other western and asian options available to enjoy. Good value for money considering the quality of the seafood presented
4
This was an amazing buffet breakfast - more food than you could possibly consider eating. The bread and butter pudding was a surprisingly treat
3
We visited on a Saturday for lunch after reading some good reviews. The ambiance was inviting, clean and pleasant.The service was good and well organised.However, the quality of food was average and variety of dishes were limited to our choice. More of cold seafood selection and Japanese food like sushi /sashimi. Different kind of cuisines were placed almost mix to each other; difficult to spot choice of food; arrangement can be improved. Especially selection on Indian and Malay food was very limited. Lots of choices for cakes. No counter for drinks at all which was disappointing. Overall experience was not bad, though not satisfied with food at all

I should have write this review long time since it happens a couple of months ago. I love to travel very much and as I travel it goes along trying food along the way and also making friend around me. I went to Singapore to visit my friend who are staying in Marina Mandarin we ate at one of the restaurant there called Aquamarine, but before that I went first at their coffee shop at the lobby. As a coffee lover I expect a good coffee, I ordered a Cafe Mocha which the staff recommend me because he told me its a must try and since its the name of their cafe. I found it funny but hey! it was really amazing! So I give points to him I think his name is Joseph a very friendly guy by the way, he keep me accompany while waiting for my friend. As I continue to eat a Aquamarine with my friend the food is fantastic and the staff are helpful. I will come back to eat and drink mocha to my next visit

The restaurant is gorgeous with the lighting atmosphere. The food were delicious and diverse ranging from Chinese, Indian, and Japanese. Besides that, I was really impressed by one of the talented staff, called "Ghim Guan". He served us always with the warm smile, eye contact and courteous service manner.The services as every time i finish my plate of food and leave my seat for a new plate of food, the previous dirty plate was removed from the table before i get back to my seat, the messy table had been wiped, napkins were folded nicely(again and again), and he was able to recommend us for the choice of buffet item and to fulfill our needs. Throughout the entire service, me and my family were totally impressed by his professional hospitality service. Before leaving the place, we would surely ask and comment about his service ,and also sharing our delightful experience to the public. Aquamarine, it is truly a good place to revisit. Well Done!
5
Wide spread of buffet choices, especially seafood. For those who want local cuisine they do have quite a few options. Their dessert spread is to-die-for. Went for a special occasion and had no regrets.

It was a surprised birthday dinner location for my father in law. Family members were impressed on the seafood variety. Seafood was fresh! Had good family fun. Excellent service by Alvin and team. Angela offered a whole cake for birthday boy instead of a slice cake(usual practise) so the whole 15 pax of us can enjoy it. Thank you Angela and Alvin for making our dinner a memorable event! Food was great, kids love the froyo cone and the choc bread pudding is to die for!! Thank you
5
It was a great dinner celebration (our wedding anniversary!) and we were further pleasantly delighted by the staff Pudza, who not only attended to us attentively, he also brought me plates for the crab shells and refilled our glasses whole night round. He also cleared our used plates very quickly. Even when he's not serving us, Pudza is the most hardworking one as he clears the table and wipe/rearrange tables to ensure neatness. Thank you Pudza for making our night extra special!
5
Pudza the waiter is excellent in eye for details of extra plate needed to throw or use purpose.this nigeria waiter is hard working i suppose in the service industry ..from the personal feeling of ex japanese speaking tourist guide

Went for lunch at Aquamarine on a weekend. The staff who was responsible for our table was prompt in refilling water and clearing plates. Overall, the food selection was not bad and pretty tasty, especially the meat! However, the seafood fell under expectations. Scallops, crabs and lobsters were bland in taste, lacking the sweetness of seafood. Desserts were delightful especially for the kids, who had fun eating the little cakes and topping up yogurt ice cream. Durian mousse cake was awesome!There was also staff distributing helium balloons to delighted kids, he was very polite and gently tied the balloons to their little wrists.Overall a pleasant experience for families if you're sitting at the external area, away from the buffet lines
5
I've always been a fan of seafood, oysters in particular, and what better way to enjoy it than in a buffet restaurant with a superb ambience which also boasts a myriad of food choices and friendly forthcoming service staff.Having been to various household names in the buffet dining industry, Aquamarine cements its place in the upper rungs. Location is brilliant, it's family-oriented, equipped with prayer rooms nearby, clean and conducive environment and did I mention the sumptuous oysters, crabs, juicy prawns that goes well with the Asian infused kitchen and desserts that'll satisfy the sweet tooth amongst us. I've been here plenty of times and will definitely have it as my personal first choice for any occasion
5
It was a department's evening out and overall, we had a great and joyful evening with good food (with more than enough of choices) and superb service! Special thanks to Wong Co Sang & team who helped us in the reservation and the people who took care for us on that evening Rosli (prior arrangement), Zulkifly & Icamen Alvin
5
i'm a regular at this restaurant but not for my colleagues. They very particular about the service provided and of course the 'freshness' of the seafood they served.It's great to see the smile from all 3 of my colleagues when they say the seafood is very fresh and the ambiance is superb(this is my favorite) coz we sat outside of the restaurant which is much 'peaceful' compared to the inside as that night there's some company event going on. Next is the service, we were serve by a female lady whom i didn' get her name but am sure she new there as she always gets the help from her manager/supervisor Mr Zulkifly for advise but she is very prompt to attend to our request and cleared our tables as soon as we stood up to 'hunt' for more food.So lastly, this restaurant is a must visit place whenever you're in singapore to enjoy the food with your loved ones !!!!!...... kudos to Marina Mandarin Singapore to have such quality staff at Aquamarine Restaurant !!!!!.....

"Great place for a gathering with friends/family”My favourite section are the Japanese, and Seafood section. The salmon sashimi, and crustaceans are fresh and delicious. On top of that, their desserts very satisfying and appealing. The experience was lovely and the staff and chefs were so friendly especially service staff Stewart gave us felt like dining at home with friends/family. Definitely a place to go back to
5
Food > Delicious ( HALAL )Place > WonderfulService > Excellent by every individual.Prayer For Muslim > Not to worry it's all well prepared.Best Place to find Halal Foods. Great service by every individual staff and Very helpful of them. Worth of the price, a very nice place indeed
5
The best service in restaurant!!! Thumbs up!! Staff are very attentive - ambience very cozy and elegant. Food got differently choices. Will recomend to all my friends.
5
Had company lunch at Aquamarine. My colleagues and I enjoyed ourselves very much there, especially receiving excellent service from Mr Rosli. Food was great no complains.
5
Great spread of food at its finest quality. Fresh seafood always ready. Definitely recommended! Exceptional service rendered by the restaurant manager, Zul. He has been great help! Will definitely come back
5
I liaised with Mr Tan LP, the manager, to surprise my wife for our wedding anniversary lunch. I just requested an order for a surprise bouquet of flowers delivered upon having lunch. I was so delighted to be treated to a table with rose petals and romantic setting done beforehand. I was pleasantly surprised with that great arrangement done by the staff. Mr Tan even made the delivery of bouquet seamless when we were taking photos suddenly the bouquet came in just in time. Would definitely return for special occasions to celebrate
1
Went to aquamarine for lunch to celebrate wedding anniversary / Valentine's Day. Decoration wise it was good. Food wise - no top up of food, cold n hard food, seafood can be counted by pieces on how many left on the trays, no Indian food corner, ice cream machine not working or spoilt as only water comes out of it, ice cream cone fell on the floor n one of the diner took it and put back on the cone rack ! So disgusting right ! Dessert so so n nothing great. Overall not a happy diner and wasted $$$ on lunch which is so overrated.
5
Worth the money for sure... My colleagues were all happy wit the food and the atmosphere... What more can we ask for ? I love the Durian Pengat..... !!! Yumm
4
Variety selection of seafood. Truly value for money!Selection ranges from oysters, clams, mussels, crabs, lobsters, crayfish,alaskan crabs onward to variety of sashimis. They served chawanmushi and soba.Hot food selection wasn't really that much or attractive e.g. indian, mediterranean food etc, desserts wasn't that much of a variety also. The yoghurt was nice though
5
The food is succulent and the flavors have remarkable depth. All the staff members greeted with smiles as warm as the food they served. Thus I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant to anyone with a desire for scrumptious food. You can get ready for a taste of heave
5
I was spoiled for choice with the excellent spread of buffet. Mr Rosli made our dinner really enjoyable with his attentiveness to us. Thank you! Will definitely visit with my family again. Highly recommended
5
Service was well, great ambience with delicious cuisines. Value for money with excellent service. Special thanks to Stewart, Alvin and Rachel. Will dine in again soon
5
We went to Aquamarine for the lunch buffet. The food was amazing, seafood was fresh and that includes the rest of the spread. The staff were friendly and my colleagues ranks them as one of the better buffet service around. In particular, i want to commend the manager Zulkifly and his staff for being attentive to our requests. Keep up the good work Aquamarine!
3
Had my breakfast at Aquamarine this morning. Wasn't too impressed. Although there looks to be many variety of food but maybe it's not suited to my taste. It's a personal preference. Other than that, the decor and food arrangement looks impressive.
5
The most stunning buffet I've ever had and definitely will be inviting more friends to come ! Thank you staff and Chef for the service rendered
5
I have had a few meeting lunches on weekdays in Aquamarine with my colleagues. For once I wanted to try its dinner spread as I was told the menu is wider and the spread is more sumptuous. I made reservations for dinner for 2 last Dec 2015 with my husband. It was indeed awesome and great!! The biggest PLUS point for me was it is a certified Halal establishment and at the same time, there is a prayer room located just outside the restaurant. I have been to many buffet establishments prior to discovering Aquamarine. Nothing beats Aquamarine's fresh seafood spread......the oysters....Yums!! They disappear as soon as they appear! :) The shrimps were perfect. Dinner includes additional local stations plus Japanese cuisine....the sashimi...it was heavenly.....The dessert spread was good. Many type of mini cakes,, pastries, puddings....etc. Not forgetting the fruits! Just writing this review itself made me salivate as I reminisce over the dinner buffet I had and now planning to go again soon with some friends.Aquamarine....keep it up!
5
Service was excellent, especially from Mr Rosli. We had a very good dinner and love the selection of food offered. Price was reasonable as well. Will definitely go there again
5
I went back to eat at this place on Saturday because I heard that there more variety of food available as compared to weekdays. Me and my wife we greeted by manager Steward, he was very nice and smile all the time. Overall we had a very good dinner lamb stew, oysters, sashimi which were my wife favorites. The staffs we friendly and cleared our plates very fast on a weekend crowd
5
Brought my team of 16 including myself for a xmas dinner gathering at aquamarine and we all enjoyed the dinner so much...time flew too fast and before we knew it, it was already closing time. AQ has changed a lot since my last visit in 2014. Love the new concept where the outdoor area was transformed to a japanese section serving sashimi n sushi and also the chinese section serving roast meat and chilli crab which allowed the restaurant to display more varieties which we already know the chefs are renowned for. Seafood as usual was great and fresh... my team and I went for many helpings of the seafood. The durian pengat was flavorful and another favorite of our table. Overall the dinner was very enjoyable. Would like to thank Lu Ping & the AQ team for the excellent service & hospitality. It was very smooth from reservations till dining. Utterly enjoyable and we will definitely be back for more
5
I had dinner with my family here. Our reservation was at 7.30pm for 5pax. While walking towards Aquamarine, the staff greeted us with a warm smile. It was only my second time there and Jay, seemed to already have recognised me. He brought us to our table and introduced his colleagues who would be looking after our table, Nik and Alvin.Throughout dinner, Alvin made sure our glasses never went below half full. He cleared our dirty plates efficiently. Alvin even came by our table to check on us a few times.The other staff, Nik, was very attentive to our needs. My father dropped his knife. All of us didnt realise that something had fallen off the table but a few minutes later, Nik came by with a new set of cutleries for him. When I was looking at desserts, Nik approached me and recommended some of the dishes and it was fantastic. He even offered hot beverages to my parents when he saw that they were done with dinner. We didnt even need to ask.Dinner was served till 10pm. At 9.30pm, although there was only 3 tables left (including mine), the staff were still topping up all the food items that was running low.Overall, the service was fantastic. Although some of the dishes werent to my parents liking, they were really pleased with the service staff. I will definitely be coming back for more!For smokers, there is a smoking area right outside. We managed to take a break in between the courses. There is also a prayer room for Muslims. My husband didnt need to ask the staff for directions as the room is visible from the restaurant itself, complete with curtains for privacy and air-conditioning.ps : The chef at the Japanese station was really friendly as well. He was very generous with the ingredients
4
The Manager on Duty(Kelvin or Kenny) sorry for not getting your name. He was accommodating to us. Service was okay. Seafood spread was wonderful but at 9.15pm the desserts and pastries almost ran out and have to get the culinary team to top up. Not much choices on local cuisine. For sgd $83nett per person abit too steep
5
i just visited aquamarine for a dinner with my family and friends. it was a very pleasant experince, the environment is very nice and clean. The food (esp. japanese food )is very nice and well prepared, the rate which the chef top up the food was very fast, i dont have to wait for very long to get what i wanted.The staffs were alsowelcoming , they always have a bright smile on their faces when they attended to me(jiankun, yanhuii,meixin) , the manager on duty ,steward, was also very friendlyand helpful. I do think aquamarine is a very nice place for a meal , no matter the occasion..
4
I patronise Aquamarine because it has a halal kitchen. Nonetheless, the food quality and buffet spread is pretty average for a hotel standard.
4
The company decided to have dinner together at aquamarine because it's food station halal. Everyone satisfied with the food and service. Food was replenish fast enough,
The seafood cold dish fresh. Prompt staff.

i just visited aquamarine for a dinner with my family and friends. it was a very pleasant dinner, the environment is very nice and clean, the seats outside the restaurant were also very quiet and comfortable. The food (esp. seafood )is very nice and well prepared, the rate which the chiefs replenish the dishes was very fast, i didnt have to wait for very long to get what i wanted after it had been cleared by other customers. The staffs were also very warm and welcoming , they always have a bright smile on their faces when they attended to me(yanhui, honghui,meixin) , the manager on duty ,steward, was also very friendly. I do think aquamarine is a very nice place for a meal , no matter with friends family or colleagues.

One of the best buffet spread available in Singapore. AND it is HALAL certified kitchen. They have a good balance of local and international cuisine. The seafood section or cold section was great. Especially the oysters!! Can really taste the freshness. They run out quick though. Another great thing, there are Mussollahs just outside the restaurant complete with a place for ablution. So, one can start their buffet meal, leave for prayer when it is time and be back at the buffet table without missing a beat
1
This was really memorable, as it was a birthday treat from my friend. Food selection feels like a restaurant serving Malay food, and hygiene levels are not good. If you are craving for some good Rendang, you can come to this place. Seafood served here are not fresh, and coffee is bland and not good. If there is a good deal, resist, spend more dollars for a better overall experience elsewhere
2
The breakfast here is at best average. No eggs Benedict as part of their buffet. Food was average and ok if included as part of the hotel stay. However, the service was excellent but not enough to entice me to come back
2
Let me start with the positives - some of the meat dishes were very good, the sashimi was fresh and the lobsters were sweet. Unfortunately, I have to talk about the negatives. Considering my friends and I paid nearly $100 each, the buffet selection was rather limited. The most disappointing was the dessert spread, which was small and ordinary. The biggest gripe I have is the service. I've only been to Aquamarine twice in the last 4 years, and each time it was the same story of slow food replenishment. On my latest visit in early December, most of the already-limited selection of dessert, including the durian pengat and tiramisu, was gone by 9pm, and not replenished until the buffet officially ended after 10pm. How could the restaurant not top up the empty dessert trays more than 1 hour before the buffet officially ended? It's unacceptable service and poor value for money. I approached two different service staff to ask about this - each told me they would check with the Chef and get back to me. But neither did. When it was time to make payment, the manager himself, called Jay, came to deliver the bill. As he stood there, I asked if he was the manager. He said yes. I then proceeded to tell him about the non-replenishment of the food, and he walked off before I finished speaking. He actually walked off as I was addressing him, picked up our credit card and left. There was no apology or explanation. He later came back to tell my friend that her card was faulty and asked for another. He did not acknowledge me or say anything about the poor service I'd highlighted to him. I had been polite and factual when telling him about my impressions of the service standard and I didn't deserve to be treated like that. It's no exaggeration to say that I'm not returning to Aquamarine. To my Muslim readers looking for a good halal buffet, you're better off at Carousel or Asian Market Cafe. To any reader looking for good service and good food worth what you pay for, look beyond Aquamarine.

Visited last friday for our company dinner...there's a wide variety of food served...The cold dishes are fresh and especially the crabs...The buffet comes with complimentary tea and coffee and is halal, The location for this restaurant is good in city area near MRT (Train) station and shopping area..Staff service is tops especially Greenie, She serve with a smile, quick and efficient.. thumb up!!This is our company dinner in this restaurant. Our company decided to have family's dinner together at aquamarine because it's food station halal and can order beer and wine separately. The food and service is OK. Food was replenish fast enough, The seafood cold dish fresh especially with Japanese food. Free flow of juice and soft drink. Oysters and Alaskan king crab legs are good enough but can not compare with tradition seafood restaurant. I don't like the chilli crabs as worse than many local seafood restaurant. Prawn is taste better than what I had expected! I think the pudding and cakes I like most! Please do not expect much as the price you paid for ...The location for this restaurant is good in city area near MRT (Train) station and shopping area

Scrumptious food with great warm service.A rare combination that can be found nowadays.An excellent gesture from Mr Lu Ping who came to our table to ask if everything was fine and even introduced himself to my family.Going the extra mile was the reason for my compliments to this amazing place and the people working for the restaurant.As
5
Heard so much about this place and decided to go there for a small celebration with my colleague because it' is a halal restaurant. The food was amazing with excellent services from a staff by the name "Greenie" . Even when busy, she still take care of our table with a warm smile. Good place to go!!
3
I won a seafood buffet dinner for two on a lucky draw. I'm glad I did not have to pay as it was really disappointing. Apart from the cold crab and slipper lobsters, the rest of the buffet was really marginal - for example the sushi was machine made, and the dessert bar was mostly empty.The only reason you would go here would be to gorge on the cold seafood, or because it is Halal
5
Oh goodness. This is the best, affordable place I have been to for a buffet. The staff there were so friendly. Needless to say, the food was extravagant and it taste so good. they had wide spread of varieties. From seafood to dessert. I will definitely come back again
4
During my 5-night stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel, I had enjoyed 5 buffet breakfasts and 2 buffet dinners at the Aquamarine Restaurant. I was very impressed by the wide selection of Asian and Western food choices in the buffets. I didn’t make any reservations and I didn’t have any problems getting a seat.Service was efficient and friendly. I was happy with the quality and taste of all the food items. The restaurant opens at 6:30 am for breakfast

You need to just try this buffet to know how awesome it is!Do make prior reservations. For seafood lovers, you will love the Alaskan King crab legs, lobsters, prawns, sashimi, shellfish etc during weekend dinner buffets (whenever in season). Lunch buffets may not be as indulgent I heard though. Their main courses and dessert are not too shabby either with a myriad of choices to suit all taste buds (both Western & Asian fare). We love their customer service too. They have a group of patient and attentive staff, signature customer service for the Mandarin group of hotels.They have also recently set-up a prayer area behind the restaurant for Muslim customers and we really appreciate that instead of going up to the Level 6 meeting rooms for our Maghrib prayers.Kudos to Mr Rahman for a good group of staff & job well-done each time we are there! Your staff never fail to present us with that lovely cake and candle for us to feel special!This venue is really suitable for special occasions with family and friends.Thank you Aquamarine for all those visits, a dozen now and counting inclusive of our anniversaries, birthdays and promotion treats. We just love you!Cheers,Mr & Mrs Sha
4
My first time there and this place is awesome for the price you pay for a hotel buffet. There are just lots of food that you can choose but can never try all of them. The sashimi is cut fresh as well as the oysters. The cakes and pastries are good but still lacking a bit if variety in the deserts.Very nice atmosphere
4
The halal buffet spread here is awesome. From sushi to dim sum to fresh ocean catches! The seafood pilaf rice offered here is a must try! There're prawns and clams that are super delicious and the rice is fragrant too. Don't miss out the durian pengyat too! It's rich and rather authentic due to the fairly low amounts of cream they add to the fresh durian. However, the noodles provided at the noodles cum roasted meats section were not that flavorsome. I will recommend this restaurant to those who look out for variety in what they eat
4
Lovely atmosphere. Huge selection of food.....buffet. Seafood, Asian, western, dessert bar etc. Something for most people. You wouldn't leave hungry. Only thing let it down, is either some of the wait staff are trainees and font know what to do, or the service is slow. We asked for our bill....took 15 minutes to arrive. In reality our only real gripe
5
Had my birthday celebration stay-cation in Marina Mandarin and had breakfast in Aquamarine also my birthday lunch with the family. Zulkifly attended to us and bring to our table despite my mum was fussy he was calm enough to handle her with his joke and make her felt more comfortable. We definitely felt welcome! Wide varieties of foods!! Superb and delicious!
5
I've been to aquamarine my third time. Honestly, Mr Zul had attend to my family with his nice gesture and friendly approach makes my mum, sis-in-law, bro-in-law and especially my fiance keeps talking about his service. Not only he explain about aquamarine food that was display on the respective area but also told us about Marina Mandarin Hotel too. His experience has earned remarkable respect by my family which keeps talking about him. Hence, I would like to say he is a superb role model of a good waiter/server of restaurant. Mr Zul had done Marina Mandarin Hotel proud. Thank you Mr Zul and Marina Mandarin
5
Totally happy with the service and the selection of food. I ate there twice. Shirley and service crew paid attention to all my needs during my time there, am greatful and will be back again soon . Food is fresh and well prepare excellent selection of international favours. Only down part is dessert selection has too many durian dishes, i cannot eat durian. Hopefully they will do more alternatives next time
5
Aquamarine is a great food place. Had my wedding here and I'm back again! Mr Tan LP, the manager, has such great personality, who is always hospitable and accomodating towards his guests. Great restaurant with great staff. Definitely will come back again
5
My first time in aquamarine, and i must say it didn't disappoint us. The food selections wereimpressive! The foods were very good, full of flavours! The seafoods were fantastic, so fresh & tasty! The service was excellent as well. Especially Harpreet, Raju and Jackielyn. Jackielyn really took care of us. Stopping by once in a while to check if we need anything. The service staffs are very professional and warm. Great food and service! Must recommend this restaurant to our friends. You have to try it out yourself because words & descriptions aren't gonna do much justice!

I have been 3 times to this restaurant located at Marina Mandarin hotel and all 3 times are of different experince. The food were of different spread. And the fact is, the buffet spread is so tempting. Thumbs up F&B team. We were serve well by Celine and Hambali. And there was these 2 elderly uncle server who always in all smile even when clearing our plates. We will return again soon

I was staying at this hotel and used the restaurant for lunch one day. At S$60/person for the buffet it is expensive, drinks are extra. The selection was typical of any buffet lunch at a hotel, nothing special. Everything was OK, but there was no stand out dish. I also went here for breakfast each morning, a lot of choice but again nothing special. The coffee is not good, maybe have some tea.
5
I worked overseas and when i took a home leave to Singapore, Aquamarine had always been my destination when i invite my friends for dinner. Last friday we went for dinner at Aquamarine again and the service was great! Especially the intern Celina whom we found was from Taiwan really took care of us with a high quality service. She made our dinner experience a great pleasure and we even took photos with her. Thank you again for the high quality service from Aquamarine staff. I will definitely return with my friends on the next home leave
4
My parents and I enjoyed a slow Saturday lunch buffet here. The weekend lunch buffet hours are from 12noon to 3pm. The selection of food here is good and it is has had good ratings for its seafood. My parents, both in their late 60s, enjoyed it very much. The waitresses were attentive to our needs. Our napkins were folded when we left the table to help ourselves to another serving. Warm and cold water were top up periodically. Remember to ask for your cup of tea/coffee when you enjoy your desserts. Previously, I had enjoyed a lunch weekday buffet with my office colleagues. It was from this dining experience that I decided to return with my parents

Aquamarine has been renovated since my last visit. The outdoor dining area has been transformed into a fully AC area ("The Terrace") and some food stations can be found there. During our visit tonight, there was a wedding reception going onion the Terrace but diners could still walk over there to get food. Food wise, it is of the same high quality. Some items, like the red velvet cupcake are a hit and miss but the fried mantous are soooooooooooo yummy. The sushi has also improved some. The restaurant also plays the prayer call and provide prayer rooms outside for Muslim diners. Spacious air conditioned tents, segregated prayer areas and ablution areas with warm water provided. Bonus: there is a live grill with satay and otah2 there as well, and not known to many diners.Tip: if you are going for a special event, like a large family gathering, you could apply for the life and style card which gives you substational savings. Tonight I paid only $72 per adult after taxes (usually 80+++). The card also gives 25% off your dining and hotel bookings plus some other perks
5
This is an ideal restaurant to bring your family along and enjoy the sumptuous buffet spread. Staff were attentive and warm. My family had a great time. Kudos to the team! friendly and pleasant, always smiling and helpful. Impoppleasantple

Wonderful dishes being serve in the buffet, cool spread for the adults and also for the kids ! Variety from Japanese, western,Local, and many more too. Friendly staffs as well.
4
We enjoy the wide spread of food . Have japanese n cakes n seafood n porridge n noodles n fruits n the ambience is great for group dinner n dating. Highly recommended.
5
Restaurant was within my hotel so held off visiting because of the number of other choices in the Bay. I should not have - food, quality, choice and service are all simply five star. Excellent out doubt.
4
Our party of 17 had various individual favourites. For some, it was the oysters, snow crab and sashimi. For others, it was the grilled leg of lamb (with basil pesto) and cream based pasta done right. The desserts spread was good, many went for the chocolate banana cake, durian pengat and soft serve ice cream on cone, amongst the many varieties available. It was commendable that hot beverage was included in the deal and the service crew was rather prompt in clearing used plates. It was an enjoyable dining experience for us. For the price, I will go back again if the quality of fresh seafood on ice is maintained
4
Had a good time dining there on a friday night. Good spread, especially for a halal buffet. Seafood was good. The durian dessert is to die for! Western and local spread were delicious too. Cakes were good. Some of it are unique and yet really delicious. The japanese sashimi was not as good. Not very well cut and not the freshest you would love it to be. But it doesnt matter, because the rest available is too good!Well trained staff, taking care of us very well and promptly. We only had one problem that could have well been avoided. The manager (guy) served us poorly. There were 19 of us. He refused to issue one more complimentary parking to us, on top of the four that i initially requested. Obviously, i missed out myself when counting who drove. It was not even a full redemption of the carpark. He told us off in a straight face, dining there doesnt equate to parking redemption and four is the max. Then he went on to explain how difficult this is for him. Its not worth wasting time on a parking ticket. But his attitude was far off from his staff, which was weird. I will most probably return again. As this is definitely one of the best halal buffet in town. Sidenote: Mysteriously, 8 of us did get diarrhea on sat and sun. I still do not want to conclude this is related to aquamarine, because i was fine. I am usually fast in reacting to bad food. I will return if i need to have halal buffet. :

Don't think this meets the mark when compared to other hotel restaurants such as those around orchard road area. The menu is not as wide and offers limited variety
5
I was there with guests from Hong Kong, it is good that the important part, the food, is of high quality, especially the seafood; the variety on offer is also very good. The atmosphere is very pleasant, although the restaurant was full, the noise level created by the diners easily assimilated to the background, making it easy to have a conversation at my own table. The wait staff is efficient and polite.It is good for guests not to arrive in the second half of the opening period of the restaurant and expect the buffet dishes to be refilled for new servings; the unconsumed food on the buffet tables is usually thrown away after the close of the dining period, and there is a national effort not to throw away too much food; I think this is a good policy to have

I've experienced many a breakfast buffet around the world and I appreciate the complexity of running them and the demands placed on the waiting staff. So I do always give fair reviews based on these world wide challenges.The staff who I interacted with were incredibly pleasant and accommodating. Very well turned out and very professional.The food, lots of it. Quality, pretty average. Temperature, poor! The food is cold after 30 seconds on cold plates. The warming plates they use are not fit for purpose.Now for my biggest gripe, I entered the buffet at 09:50, bearing in mind that they finish at 10:30. But I was immediately told, were closing soon. I think 40mins is enough to get a breakfast in wouldn't you agree?Come 10:00 service from the staff had all but finished, they were all task focused on closing the restaurant. They were rushing about eyes dead ahead getting the place closed down. None of the dishes that were empty come 10:05 were being replaced, and the already slightly warm dishes were left to go cold. My needs are very basic, I just fancied a cup of coffee. Short of shouting 'hey I need some coffee' you can't get hold of anyone to look after it for you. They are just obsessed with getting the place shut down! I eventually got a cup of coffee about 10mins later which was slightly above room temperature and half full, I suspected the end of a pot!?So we're now at about 10:20 and a member of staff approaches me to alert me to the fact that they were closing soon and to help myself to anymore food(or what was left of it). Again the staff member was very polite and friendly, but as soon as I said thank you he was gone and straight back to the closing down frenzy! I had a quick look around the dishes and very little was left with much of it just looking rather limp. So I packed up and left. The staff thanked me and said good bye(then back to the frenzy).So in short, the food is good and bountiful as long as you get in early, from speaking to my colleagues they agree that anything past 09:40 and the dishes are left, generally not topped up and the closing down ceremony starts. I know the Singaporeans are sticklers for time. But if I walk in the door at 10:20, which shouldn't be an issue since you FINISH at 10:30 then so be it. The whole experience is ruined by the military operation to finish serving BY 10:30 not at 10:30. Get in early folks or sit and watch the a restaurant close while it's open? Word of advice to management: When you say you serve breakfast till 10:30, you serve until 10:30 THEN you start clearing up, don't start washing up while punters are sat watching you all darting round the place eager to get me out

A halal Certified Buffet restaurant, excellent selection of cold dish and Asian spread , almost everything is there. It was a Ramadan spread during our visit there. The cold dish crab was simply delicious with various sauce to go along with. Great Service from the staffs, hostess and especially Staff Kishore was taking care of our table. Overall it was a beautiful experience dining in Aquamarine. We will be back soon
5
It was an eye opener.. vast of fooda to choose and quality of food was A.W.E.S.O.M.E. Though a bit pricey, but personally it is on par with the service and foods. I didnt eat as much as i shud, but i truly enjoyed the buffet foods... so here are some of the selected foods i ate...
5
Me and my husband have visited thus place a couple of times. I like it quite atmosphere, good food and helpful staff. we are not a buffet goers but for this one we made an exeption. worth to visit
5
We were pleasantly surprised at the spread, quality and taste. The service was great! Return factor? Very high. Price is steep but worth it. Come hungry....

We went for their lunch buffet recently. The variety was good but they didn't replenish the empty dishes quick enough to cater to all customers, especially the cold crab claws was definitely insufficient because most of us could only stared at a handful of others took them & it's gone! Then after 12.30pm, we didn't notice them replenishing this dish again & lunch service was from 12pm to 2.30pm.Also, their advertisement clearly stated that there's chilli or black pepper crabs but there wasn't any! We asked the staff & he said it's only available during dinner service. Another couple seated next to us showed him the advertisement promoting lunch buffet (not dinner) & he blamed it on their marketing department & said it was a 1-for-1 offer (implying that all of us shouldn't expect too much)!There wasn't much service provided for guests seated outside. Basic service like replenishing water & clearing soiled plates was not attended to promptly. Within 2 hours, they only cleared our plates twice!We wrote to the hotel & no one bothered to reply! Really appalling service from a 5★hotel
3
This is a set price buffet, not cheap either, with a large selection to choose from - if you read the labels by the empty containers.I visited recently and arrived at about 8pm. The seafood selection included lobster, crab, prawns etc. but unfortunately a good few of the containers were empty and after waiting 30 minutes to see if they would be replenished I gave up.I had the last two prawn sushi available and again, these were not replenished. The hot section was very dissapointing....the food look as though it had been sitting all day and most of the containers were close to empty making what food was there look very dry and unappealing. Overall I was very disappointed as I paid the same as those who turned up at opening time but I was not afforded the same choice or quality.

The buffet spread here is awesome. From sushi to dim sum to fresh ocean catches! The seafood pilaf rice offered here is a must try! There're prawns and clams that are super delicious and the rice is fragrant too. Don't miss out the durian pengyat too! It's rich and rather authentic due to the fairly low amounts of cream they add to the fresh durian. However, the noodles provided at the noodles cum roasted meats section were not that flavorsome. I will recommend this restaurant to those who look out for variety in what they eat
4
Great, spacious and clean venue for group outings. Service staff were prompt and courteous. Huge variety of buffet spread. Suitable for Muslim friends as no pork and no lard served. Started with the cold seafood selections and worked through the hot foods till desserts. I personally liked the stewed beef and smoked salmon the best. The sushi was prepared fresh on the spot. The meatball with Teriyaki sauce and mayo was good. The pasta was a tad bit disappointing as it was too salty and overpowering with black pepper. The durian pengat is irresistible

I dined at Aquamarine for buffet breakfast, as part of the hotel stay package on 12 July 2015. (For readers to note that this review is specific to the buffet breakfast, and may not be accurate representation of their buffet lunch and buffet dinner offerings, which you pay market price for).Service: Ok, not bad.We walked into the restaurant without any reservation at about 7.15am, as there should not be a big crowd on a Monday morning. We were shown to our seats, which was near a corner. The corner was already quite packed, with the gap between each table being narrow. This led to some slight discomfort throughout the session.Would have preferred for staff to allow free-seating by guests.Another minor issue was to see the manager/captain telling his staff off for some minor issue, plus pointing to a foreigner lady guest and then shouting instructions to the staff to serve her coffee.it could have been handled better. Disagreements/instructions/shouting should not be shown in front of the guests.The staff clearing plates/cups were swift and efficient though. They were the savings grace of the restaurant.Food: A bit disappointed.Taste preference actually defer from person to person, but there should be slighty more variety for certain food types.The various flavors of cereals (in bulky dispensers) probably took up too much space.On the other hand, my personal view was there was limited MEATS to choose from. Only lamb sausages, "Pizza chicken" and maybe one or two more. i did not see any chicken nuggets/fried chicken wings or other variety.Fruits and fruit juice (not fresh type; all from packet/concentrates) were ok. At least there were variety to choose from.Also, for local dishes, also limited choices? (Only saw fried bee-hoon and a couple of other dishes).In the end, I am tempted to say that there are better choices for buffet breakfast elsewhere (if you are not a hotel guest and have to choose Aquamarine as the default breakfast restaurant). If I may say so, I think restaurant "R" at Marina Bay Sands and restaurant "E" at Pan Pacific offer better buffet breakfast, in terms of variety, choice and taste.But readers please take discern that you have to take into account the "Halal" factor when deciding if this restaurant is really poorer or better, compared to the other restaurants in nearby hotels offer buffet breakfast. "Halal-certified" means more than just "no-pork-no-lard". It means the food has to be prepared by Muslim-suitable/certified staff and taken from halal sources. This includes the ingredients and slaughtering/cooking procedures and handling processes and serving too.For our foreigner friends, if you are a primarily meat eater, my personal view is you may have better options elsewhere (if you are not obliged to eat here due to buffet breakfast being part of your stay package by default). Do remember this review may not accurately reflect the quality/variety of Aquamarine's lunch and dinner offerings too! Cheers

Visited last month for our company retreat. Our big group were seated very quickly by a pleasant young man name Zulkifly, he was extremely helpful and took the time to help one of my colleague with her choices as she has to have gluten free food The assortment of seafood was great and fresh. The quality of the food was tasty, better than expected. Overall its a great experience for our first visit.. will be again.
5
We went to the Ramadhan buffet for dinner and there's a wide variety of food served. The cold dishes are fresh and I especially like the crabs.The buffet comes with complimentary tea and coffee. Plus points is that it is also halal. To add, the service headed by Mr Zulkifly and his team was superb. Keep it up and a must try 
5
I'be been to Aquamarine about 5 times since it opened, the most recent one being just this last weekend. And I will go again. Staff service is tops especially the Manager Zulkifly. I booked at the last minute for father's day for my family parents with a last minute addition of aunt and family. To my surprise, they were able to take the reservation even though they were full. When I reached there I realise they had set up the tables just for us. Even though the restaurant was full, the seating area and food spread were well spaced out so you never feel like you are jostling for food like in some other buffet hotels. Spread is good, and quality excellent. They quality control is maintained with food served in sufficient quantities but never running out. They top up fresh food continually. There's a good spread of seafood, western and eastern menu and desserts.Muslim prayer area was just outside and very convenient and hot drinks are served individually and fresh.One of my favourite buffet places in Singapore
5
Best seafood in my life in this restaurant.very good staff and welcoming. Price is not expensive compared to 5 star service in Singapore.
5
We came for iftar (breakfasting) as the restaurant served halal food. We feel the warmth welcome from the moment we entered hotel lobby until we have seated by the restaurant hostess. Food quality is superb, seafood is fresh, selection is varieties! Service is very excellent by the server, hostess and the chef. Please look for this person as they will take care of everything Mei Xin, Jackielyn, Julie and Harpreet

..but only on Fri-Sat :) weekday seafood spread is still impressive, but nothing compared to their weekend dinners.So, once upon a time, halal diners looking for a 'fancy' hotel buffet were limited to Carousel and Aquamarine. There are more offerings available now, thankfully, but Aquamarine is still the place to check out if you are looking for fresh seafood.The restaurant has renovated recently, to include more indoor seating and new food stations. Everything I've tasted is delicious, although their sushi is a bit of a let down (weird, considering they have a very highly rated Japanese restaurant just next door). Service is always with a smile, quick and efficient. Hotel breakfast is also served here, and it can get very crowded, so come early.If you sign up for their Life & Style membership, you get a 25% discount on your dining
3
We've been to a few Hotel buffet styled Restaurants in Spore, namely 21onRajah & Carousel. We find this the quality & variety served here is the same as elsewhere. Nothing that special. On a positive note, Good to try at least once
5
were here for last mins dinner with my wife and son, lucky enough to get a seat, according to the restaurant manager, have to make booking on friday and satursday, cos it's packed and fuuly booked on that days.The foods here are fresh and varity are more than I espected, espacially the seafood section, I have taken mre than 1 time.Will come back again
2
My family decided to go to aquamarine for dinner the other. So first of all we were made to sit in the dimly lit lounge instead of the actual restaurant, and lounge seating is not suitable for meals! Anyway... That would still be fine if there wasn't that incessant drilling sound throughout much of the course of our dinner. Repair works, apparently. The waitress knew absolutely nothing about the food. Every question we asked was met with a blank stare and an 'I don't know'. Seriously, we chose to eat at Marina Mandarin because it is a 'nice' hotel and we wanted a 'nice' dinner. Ended up sitting on uncomfortable seats, squinting to read the menu and ordering based on guesswork because we got zero help. It's a shame because the food was actually quite good and we could have had a great time. I seriously hope, for their sake, that it was an off day, but I'm not going back again to find out
3
More selection of local cuisines such as prata, nasi lemak and teh tarik even might be good? Lacks variety and I think travellers from overseas might appreciate more local foods.
4
This restaurant is my 2nd favourite for halal buffet in Singapore. Great quality food with good selection of dishes and desserts. Been here twice and loved it
5
Wide variety of food available. Not sure if the food was so good and runs out really fast, or the refills takes so long to be filled
4
1st time visit with family, good buffet spread and food are top up periodically. Nice ambience for family and friends gathering, got to know they are Halal certified, can bring my Muslim friends here for a gathering. The waiting staffs are friendly and helpful, especially they are always attending to my children needs. Great place, will come again
3
Food are all nice. Just that therw is not much variety. Really love the Cold alaskan crab. worth the price. will not come again though because its too expensive.
4
It was a good experience dining at Aquamarine. Very efficient service when i requested for a slice of cake for the quiet celebration.
4
Seafood variety was great. Seafood was fresh. Service was good. A pity they did not serve chilli crab on that day.
4
Had a Chinese New Year dinner with colleagues. Good selection of seafood comprises of crab, crayfish etc. Tempura at the Japanese section was a let down. It's soggy and oily instead of crispy. Indian section was awesome. Yummy fish and mutton curry.
3
Was there on 3Apr2015. Food was great with the variety and taste! What was missing were the egg painting, balloon sculpting that were promised when I made the phone enquiry. Was told by the staff at the restaurant that activities are only on Easter sunday - why the diff in comms? As a result, my kids were sorely disappointed!
3
I could not take seafood as I am allergy, a bit wasted. Went there twice for ex-company team building and Chinese New Year. Personally find that the varieties aside from seafood are not a lot, the taste was average too. For such a pricy price paid, you can get better food outside definitely. I liked the dessert corner though, nothing fanciful about this restaurant
3
Seafood limited. Cooked dishes not that spectacular to compare with the pric paid. I thought i could cook better.Desserts nothing fantastic. No top up though platter has been left empty for quite sometime. Slow service
5
We were their last Saturday 14/3/15 for a lunch sitting with the family from Singapore and to walk into an amazing seafood display (except oysters not happy) was mind boggling the photos at least 30 being taken by the fist time locals of the display was in it self incredible all the seafood was so fresh crab, prawns, scallops, spanner crab, all types fish, the corn chowder soup the hot meats roast beef, chicken teriyaki the breads the deserts, the sweet fruits and the special area for the Japanese and Chinese stations al the was so tender and cooked to perfection and all the staff were so pleasant special thank-you to Mary, I have been to many buffets in Singapore be this one on that day gets my 10 out of 10 Thank-you from the Family.ps we had a deal of buy two get one free so only costing $40 per head x 6

Was there just last month to celebrate my Birthday, it happens to be the period of Chinese New Year as well. Frankly, for the price that we paid, which is close to many others such as Ritz Carlton...etc, it wasn't worth it.However, I must say the seafood is just awesome! And that was all. Seafood was the star and the only star of the night. Was wondering where the sashimi was, only to discover it was hidden in one corner. Sashimi was alright since it was already sliced and plated. Just ask for it and you will get a plate from the chef. (He looks quite bored as barely much people visit his station since it was hidden in a corner.) Chawamushi has always been my favourite but it was way to salty for me to have more than 2. Hot food was disappointing. The roasted beef was so hard and slightly cold that I only took 1 bite of it.As we already informed 1 of the staff that it was my Birthday, there was a slice of cake which tasted delicious. Not being stuck out or what but at least when you serve the cake, you could have just wished the person a Happy Birthday.Because the seats inside were occupied, we were seated outside. It's comfortable but the lightings outside made me a little dizzy as compared to when I'm inside.Wanted to give this a try after searching out for reviews online but I should have just stuck to my initial plan of choosing Greenhouse than AquaMarine based on the food and service

Great place for gathering for large group. The buffet was full of seafood- great for seafood lovers as most of the items are fresh. They have a variety of selections on the buffet however if you are not a fan of trying new food, make sure you think twice before getting it on your plate. For example, we all thought the Spring Roll contains vegetables only to find out it's durian in it. My favorite was actually the grilled prawns. It's so good that you can actually taste the marination. Good job Chefs!Service was efficient. Staff is able to show absolute quality of serving the best. Ambience was great, cept for the new decorations. It could have been better with more effort in portraying Chinese New Year celebration, i mean, come on? You guys should be good at this isn't it?Nevertheless I'll definitely be back for the fresh seafood! Keep it up
4
This is one restaurant with amazing ambience to treat that special one. It is beautiful and has a good range of food. a little expensive but worth keeping for that special moment
3
We had a snack from the a la carte menu on our arrival at the hotel and we were disappointed. The quality of the food was not what we would have expected for the price. The Club sandwich was made of processed meats, cheese and ordinary white sliced bread and was totally tasteless. The Caesar salad with prawns was adequate but not good value at 30$$ and only contained 3 grilled prawns and not much Parmesan and croutons etc. For a total of 56$$ for our food not a value meal.We did eat buffet breakfast here in the mornings and that was fine with plenty of choice but having had a poor meal the first night we did not try the dinner buffet
5
Though the price was quite steep, the service is definitely tip-top at this buffet restaurant. There were definitely lots of fresh seafood. However they could improve on the variety of Japanese and Indian food that they have. There were some hits and misses, for example, the seafood pasta was only average and the cold crabs were not sweet. But other than that, we had such a wonderful experience ther
5
RSVP was for 1.45pm but was caught up at work reached only 5mins before 2pm Buffet was till 2.30pm. The spread was hearty & I actually thought there was not enough time to try everything with so little time left. However buffet carried on till 3pm!! The staff gave us ample reminder how long more we can enjoy our meal, we were not rushed to leave. Thank you Aquamarine staff! Good food, great staff & service!
5
Buffet was great and i really love the Durian Pengat Dessert! The indian section is nice too. But the spread is not as wide as there is in Carousel. Went there for our anniversary and the staff even provide a slice of cake to my fiancee.But Service is excellent as the waitress & waiter is very attentive and will always top up water for customers. Might be coming back in January again! :

Well, not much of a variety of food to choose from. Only few asian food to choose but the thing that i love the most there is the Durian Pengat! For durian lovers, you should try it. Otherise the seafood is delicious too. & i got a sliced of cake for my anniversary. Overall, nice experience & great ambience

Dined here last week with my colleagues on a busy Friday evening. We made our booking just around noon and it was successful. The buffet spread includes cold seafood selection, a Japanese section, an Indian section and a dessert section. The cold seafood section had oysters and other seafood dishes including their signature chili crab, prawns and lobsters. The Japanese section served fresh tempura prawns and zucchini as well as a wide range of sushi. The meat carving section served rendang marinated turkey sharwama which was pretty tasty. The Indian section served chicken, fish and vegetable curry along with briyani and naan. The dessert section had special Christmas desserts such as country pudding, log cakes and pastries. They also served ice cream and sorbet. The food was mediocre. The selections weren't extensive like other popular buffet restaurants. The service was pretty efficient though. The waiters cleared the plates and filled up drinks promptly. Overall, it's an average buffet place
3
 My encounter during my dinner there. There is actually a live fly in my Clam. I did not make any noise or anything, I just point the fly to the server and ask her to take away my plate.Your restaurant manager came up to me and apologised repeatedly. We accepted the apologies infact we just let the matter off as its just a trivial matter. But we were impressed by the serviced rendered to us. We are given complimentary drinks on the house and also a 20% discount which we did not ask for.Apart from that it was a great service. we enjoyed our dinner there. Thank You Aquamarine for making my Anniversary an enjoyable experience.
3
Went for "tunch" on Sat afternoon. The place was crowded. The buffet was quite good but Beef rendang was too salty. The seafood gratin and durian penget were lovely. Nice place to meet up with friends. Kids would enjoy the ice cream and mashmallow / sprinkles.The Filipino lady at the entrance and a Chinese waitress were rather pleassnt. The male staff outside the restaurant looked hassled and grumpy
4
They have a varities of international foods and tasty. Very spacious area for dining and staffs are very friendly and courteous.
2
Pros: easy to get to by MRT. Good eating environment with bird chirps.
Cons: Not impressed with the spread. No seafood counter no sashimi. Service slow not attentive.
Will not visit again unless there's a drastic improvement of food & service.
5
The seafood selection is fantastic. I really enjoyed the sweet snow crab, prawns, mussels and fresh oysters!!!The freshness of salmon is a must to try there!Always make a reservation in advance so as to avoid any disappointment.The black pepper crab, laksa, medium rare beef, smoked duck and the wide variety of deserts is a must to try too!
4
I've made a reservation at this restaurant for my husband birthday. We were greeted by the friendly host and were ushered to our table. It's located right next to the window glass so that we can see the view from the top.There's variety of food ranging from local to international cuisine. Tasty and suitable for Muslim diners as its certified halal!The staffs made a surprise for my husband and sang a birthday song for him. Thank you so much for the aquamarine team members! Truly appreciate your efforts!We will definitely be there soon
4
Booked a dinner for my family. The restaurant was kind enough to provide us with a complimentary slice of cake to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food was okay though i expected a slightly higher standard than what was presented. Adequate choice of buffet items though not expansive. Great service from the the team nontheless
4
The main attraction would be the seafood spread which is very fresh with a wide variety of choice including sea whelk, Canadian oysters, Boston lobster claws, slipper lobsters, Alaskan king crab legs, mussels, clams, tiger prawns and the infamous Singapore chilli crabs (which I did not sample for reasons outlined below) among others.The Japanese corner was also commendable even though a somewhat limited choice of salmon, tuna and sea bream sashimi of fair quality was present. However an absence of tako (octopus tentacle) and ebi (shrimp) could have made this a more complete selection. The Sushi selection was otherwise ordinary but the availability of freshly steamed Chawanmushi, which is more prevalent in an ala carte buffet setting, was a pleasant surprise.Other areas of the buffet comprised of the standard Western, Indian and local fare of which only the chicken tandoori, seared tuna and clam vongole deserve honourable mention. The roast meat section offered lamb and chicken which appeared a tad dry which did not spark any intention on my part. (Do note that I prefer my meats medium rare so it is no fault of the restaurant that they were unable to meet this criteria in a buffet spread.)I refrain from local fare at most buffets as the chances that most Zhe Char restaurants will easily outdo even the best hotel chefs when it comes down to this variety of cuisine. Hence I cannot comment on any items at the buffet that fall into this category however suffice it to say that a variety of these dishes are available.The dessert highlight of Durian Pengat which proved to be a bit disappointing (perhaps due to Durian being off-season) steered my preference towards the Bread and Butter Pudding as an alternative. An adequate variety of cakes, kueh and ice cream which I did not sample, would satisfy most "dessertees" although it would not be considered a milestone of this buffet.Finally I must add that the environment is highly conducive for group dining with tables spaced generously and a distinct absence of chatter which I understand is due to a recent refurbishment of the restaurant.Overall recommended at the current price and promotional discounts of 15% for selected credit card
3
I'd prefer to eat at Sakura International which has more food selection plus free flow of soft drinks. The quality of food at Aquamarine may be a bit higher but I think Sakura can match that with a lower price and more variety of food selection especially sushi, desserts and ice-cream flavours
3
The buffet served was of good quality with Alaskan crab legs and oysters with few other varieties of crabs and prawns. There was the Asian dishes especially the carbo which I avoided as by doing so my capacity to eat the good stuff would have diminished. Quality wise it was good. However by the time the resteraunt was full the oysters were not replenished. Mind you the cost of the dinner per head was $80 ++ but the cost was mostly for ambience. Will I go there again? No
4
By Singapore Hotel pricing standards this place is a bargain. It's about $80. Singapore dollars per head and that includes all taxes and gratuities. The Dinner tonight was absolutely great. The buffet is massive and the food was exceptional.From sushi, sushimi, fried shrimp to wonderful salads, beautiful fresh fruits, boiled crab, steamed Alaskan King Crab, lobster, boiled shrimp, fresh whole salmon, all kinds of clams, fresh scallops on the half shell, oysters on the half shell to meats, pasta, pizza, fresh breads, Indian dishes, Singaporean dishes, grilled meats and all the sweets you can imagine. And...I haven't even touched on everything!!!Since it's a buffet the staff doesn't have much to do but keep your glasses full and take away the tons of empty plates but they do that without you ever needing to call them over. They are quite pleasant and willing to help you in any way they can.A great place to entertain a group of people and the place is lively. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot. Dinner Saturday night was superb. I can only imagine what a Sunday brunch might offer. Whatever time you choose to darken the doors of this establishment I would recommend you have a bed or sofa to go to for a rest afterwards
5
DinnerThe buffet was beautiful. I've seen a real mixture of reviews, but my husband and my experience was fantastic. It was appropriately fresh, tasty, variety, hot or cold and plentiful. You certainly paid for the privilege.BreakfastThe atmosphere was fantastic, particularly with the chirping birds in the atrium. Our room was on 21st floor and could hear the beautiful chirping all the way to our room. Not loud, just sweet. The food was lovely and also had great variety

Took a visitor from the UK there for buffet dinner with my wife and a friend on June 2, 2014.My previous visit was when I celebrated my wife's birthday in December 2013 with our daughter, we had a great time and service was good.When making the reservation, I requested an alternative seating and it was arranged when we arrived at the restaurant - well done!During this visit at 9pm, the dessert table ran out of macaroons and the four of us were asking a chef whether they will replenish the table when I received a call from the restaurant manager asking (in what I felt as a harsh, accusatory tone) whether we were still at the restaurant.I replied yes and asked why he called. He said a member of his staff told him that our table was unoccupied for more than 5 minutes. Then he mumbled something that sounded like "Never mind" and hung up. Although he and his staff have a process to ensure no customer runs away without paying, I believe there is a better way the manager can handle this. Is 5 minutes the maximum all diners can leave their table unattended? Can the staff be more attentive and remember which patrons belongs to which tables? How should a call to customers be conducted (tone, mannerism, etc.) when you cannot locate them? Is the caller trained to "salvage" the situation when he realised that a mistake was made and that the customers are still in the restaurant?The chef whom we asked about the macaroons replenished the dessert table, then personally came to our table and said enjoy! That was great service!I liked my previous experience and hence I took my overseas visitor to this restaurant. I hope this latest incident was an isolated one, and I look forward to a better encounter in my next visit

During my 6-days stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel for training, I had breakfast and lunch at the Aquamarine for the whole 6 days as my room bookings included the breakfast and my training course included lunch. However, I did not get bored with the foods.You will enjoy the variety of foods here especially desserts, salads and fruits! I recommend you to try the Chocolate Pudding and Durian Mousse Cake. They also served Japanese food with Salmon Sashimi and grilled foods.Take outside seats at the lobby to enjoy the hotel scenery while you relax with the bird chirping
4
I love having breakfast here. The staffs are very friendly, well except the one time for this one lady...Very large buffet spread. From cereals, sushis to Briyani rice, and from juices and coffees and teas, they sure provide a lot of choices. I really love it.Plus, its certified halal so that is a plus plus point for Muslims like me. Although maybe the seats are located a bit far from the buffets table.Would come here again just to have breakfast even if not staying in Marina Mandarin
1
We had a Tuanch today and basically all the food are cold even the newly spread out roti Prata from Prata corner, I just simply do not understand why the 5 Star hotel serving this very low quality food. We just couldn't believe it!. The taste is bad my worst ever buffet. Simply the chefs are not skillful enough to cook under Halal restriction. My own guess as the chef are mostly non-muslim (I guess) as i seen 4-5 chinese chef walking around the restaurant during buffet timing. The only taste OK food is durian pengat but is not great. We were stop eating after the first round.Only good thing is free flowing coffe and tea. That it.The service is bad as well as we have to call the waiter/waitress to clear our plates since the start till the end and obviously the staff are not properly trained before allowed serving customers

Good spread of multicuisine breakfast - especially Chinese and Japanese. The fruit spread is also good - with fresh and compote fruits. I love the foyer eating place because it is in the atrium and opens ou to the ceeling of the hotel - where the skylight streams in gradually and the "bird chirps" is agood way to waken up apart from the hot tea and coffee

It was lunch buffet sponsored by my company. Checked the price earlier, per pax is SGD60++. Ambience was crowded and lively. Cold dishes like crabs, scallops, prawns, salmons and seared tuna was THE hot stuff as the staff kept on replenishing them when it ran out though I don't see any lobster. Staff were attentive in changing new plates but if only they smiled more.Durian lovers would love the Durian Pengat and Durian Cake, creamy and not too sweet just the way I love it! I enjoyed the Pecan Pie too. My friend had 2 plates of cold dishes, guess it must be really good! I'm not a fan of seafood however there are other variety of food to choose from. Overall I don't mind coming here again on special occasions but not everyday lunch cos it's pricey

Make a reservation few days before we dine. Reservation have been make outside the Atrium area along the glass panel. On the day we were direct to other seat, but when we request back to the original seat the server accommodate for our request. It was full house in the restaurant, the rest have to be seated out of the restaurant, tables setting all the Same. Our table was not setup for the dinner, thus no paper napkins and also scissors for the crab, have to request one for it. The buffet spread can compare to others buffet in the surrounding area. Slipper lobster, oyster (not really fresh), big prawns, king crab, live pasta station, desserts, sushi station, hot food etc. I'm a seafood lover especially oyster, before I start with raw food I'll filled my stomach with some hot savory first. But I'm quite disappointed with the temperature with the food, mostly were room temperature or even cold. I had the pasta for the live station. There was only 1 chef station to make the pasta, I ordered alio olio spaghetti. Yes it was hot cooking from the station. The taste was superb, the best I have for the dinner. But the chef with his mustache doesn't look good at the beginning. But it was nice. Dessert was so so... 
4
The seafood for the buffet dinner was abundant and good. Those with craving for seafood will not be disappointed here. Service level of the staffs was also a thumb up. Only complaint was that the oysters did not come fast enough since they seem to be a hot favorite there and were always finished in minutes

Went here for the second time as guests of a large institution. So many choices and it all seems fresh and well-prepared. Maybe not the most adventurous food you'll find in Singapore, but for a hotel buffet with a huge variety of offerings (especially seafood), we were pleased. My guess is that it is NOT inexpensive at all
5
Went there with my family of 4 for tunch. Variety of food was great and tasty and the best part was it was peaceful, maybe because we were seated at the atrium which really had a calm ambience. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Mazlinda and Hisyam who were very attentive and always on smiles. Asked for tea and coffee refills up to about 5 times and they were still smiling! Price was great for tunch as we had a 15% discount and we could just laze there from 12 pm to 4 pm. Will definitely eat there again and probably stay there as it seems they have good deals
3
Lots of cold selection...cold this cold that...i suppose it's easier to prepare and keep. Could have worked on the hot dishes selection. Layout was good. Spread out and still within reach. Sushi bar wayyyy overcrowded.
5
If you like seafood this is the place to eat , a very large variety and the the desserts are amazing .

I was here during the F1 Singapore Grand Prix for this international buffet. The food was fresh but seemed uninspiring, especially the Japanese items. Perhaps I went during a period when people were avoiding areas like this around the circuit.

1. Staff is great. Wonderful actually, they managed to surprise my partner even if its 2 days in advance.2. Ambience is great too. Theres indoor sitting (near buffet area) & outside the restaurant compound. I would rather sit outside as it looks more romantic.3. If you are craving for seafood eg. Crabs, lobster, prawns, oyster..pls do so & come here. Its fresh, many varieties & huge. Other than that, the food is so so. I love the creamy dory fish although its a tad too milky. Whereas the beef satay is wonderful. The tom yam goong soup is too out of taste. It tastes more like "fish asam pedas". Desserts is great too but too little variety. U only have 2 ice cream flavours which is yam & corn. Sounds great? I"ll pass. Overall, i'll say its just a ok halal buffet with great staff
3
Went there for company dinner, pretty good service standards, but the variety of food is quite limited... Sashimi is fresh & they have pretty good grilled food, the rest wasn't really outstanding... Do try it out if u want only sashimi & grilled chicken & maybe some oysters & crabs..

We enjoy staying at the Mandarin. This was our 2nd visit.The Aquamarine had a"turkish buffet" as the feature. Our group entered and as we were seated we were asked if we wanted the buffet and I asked what the price was. This was repeated 3 times before finally being told it was S$80. We decided to stay. The sight of the buffet was impressive with a vast array of food , especially seafood. However there was little that was "turkish". Pasta made to order which my wife enjoyed. I tried a wide variety of foods. However on sitting down it turned out that the hot items were not very warm (e.g. the gyros meat had the heat lamp pointed away) and some of the cold items were almost room temp including the snails and seared tuna. This should have been a warning sign. The food was generally bland. The snails were rubbery. We were never approached for a drink order, Water refills and plate clearing were slow. On top of i there were a lot of families with ill-controlled children wandering all over. Breakfast buffet was quite good.To cap it off, I ended up with food poisoning making the long flights home to the US pure misery. The others in the group that stuck to the pasta (and no cold seafood) were OK but this far too much to pay for a pasta bar
4
celebrated my wife birthday there as greenhouse was fullhouse for brunch. went for dinner...they even kept the flowers which was delivered earlier tat day.after we got seated they were very nice to ask when I anted the flowers...service was very good the whole evening...but the food refills could have been better...oysters n crayfish was not refilled as often as they ran out.sashimi was good.I should have request to seat at the lobby area as the ambience was good..

If you are craving for crabs, oysters, prawns, sashimi and everything seafood, this is the place.I visited during the F1 week and UOB cards get 1 for 1 promo. They have a large variety of fresh seafood and other chinese, malay, indian, and japanese dishes. They have plenty of choices for desserts too. I don't think this is my best meal aver but I think it's worth coming back
4
The Alaskan king crab and the fresh oysters, sashimi were good. I enjoyed the range of desserts too. An enjoyable family time too, with quiet and nice atmosphere. The Japanese food like sushi however did not really appeal. The cooked food was average. But for the fresh seafood and spread of desserts, I would visit again. =
4
Excellent service! From the moment we arrived till the time we left, all the staff were attentive, helpful and professional. The seafood variety was superb. The oysters were fresh but I could tell that the rest of the seafood were defrosted items. The Alaskan king crab legs were really meaty and more than a foot long. So worth it!The Asian spread and the hot food were passable. The salad variety was adequate and to my liking - several types of greens, beans, artichokes, olives etc I don't have a sweet tooth but the dessert varieties were splendid.Another plus was tea and coffee were included.Definitely will go again to Aquamarine
5
we´ve been satisfied with our late night hunger here, an amazing plate---lobster! as we love wines, we were suggested with the finest red wine, simply the best!
4
Very good spread. Very well displayed. There was a Thai food promotion when we had lunch. Was generally good except for the Pad Thai. That was too dry. Generous portions of sashimi which were very fresh. Service was excellent. A very good experience overall.
5
Just came back from dinner buffet at the Aquamarine. Good seafood spread and its super fresh and tasty! Hokkaido crab , prawns and fresh oysters, mussels, plenty of shell fish, lobster too! Dessert was a superb spread! Grilled seafood was tasty!Amazing! For the price $78++ per pax it is super worth it! Highly recommended!
3
Not sure if the high tea was a trial as the selection was way too small even for a small eater like me. For such a small selection, I expected good quality but I can only rate it as OK at best, nothing exceptional. Service was good but the overall experience would not make me return

I bought deal vouchers online for 20 pax for their HIGH TEA BUFFET. Even after a discounted price of $38/pax, it is considered quite a sum for what they served us. I was expecting sashimi, cold crab but they only have sushi. No fried chicken wings, but chopped chicken when you request for it from the station and we have to wait in Q while the server chop the chicken. The rest was normal local buffet spread, fried noodles, fried rice, braised duck etc, nothing special. The only dish I went for a second helping is the 'roti prata' more like a deep fried puff and I topped it with the Indian curry vegetable, and it was only because I took a small portion on the first round and nothing else entice me for a second helping. For desert, the durian cake disappeared soon after it appeared as it was not a huge one, and I waited for some time before they bring out another piece. Because I'm a durian lover, I enjoyed the durian puree but it's only a personal liking. I could not think of anything else worth mentioning, just the normal stuff. I'm disappointed as I was expecting a better spread and variety for the original price of $49.95 with GST. But what was worth mentioning is the service. I give them a thumb's up. They are there so often to change your plates and clear the used ones, to top up your drinks and even fold your napkins while you are away from the table. For service, I wold give them an excellent rating.Would I return? It's a NO. Not for that price even after discount
4
eat to your heart's content with the king crab buffet spread. fresh and yummy. the staff were very attentive and seeing we have a plate full of king crab, immediately brought the special crab scissors so that we could enjoy the king crab meat easily. there is also a sashimi corner, literally because we almost missed it. currently there is a thai food special so you get to taste thai dishes. very nice! this is over and above the other cooked food available. for dessert, make room for that special durian puree or mousse. it is very rich and delicious. wonderful ice cream flavours too
3
Had buffet lunch and the hot food selection was a Thai-theme. The sashimi was chef-served but quite generous portions of salmon, tuna and sea bream. Salmon was good but the tuna and sea bream was satisfactory. The variety of dessert and ice cream spread was excellent. The durian puree was the bitter-sweet variety, which I love. Did not take any of the Thai food - poor appetite that day. Seafood selection was cold variety and the cold Flower Crab was sweet but you have to use your hands to break the shell. Service was above average. Overall, I felt the price was high especially if you didn't eat much sashimi and sushi
5
Great and friendly customer service. There was a Thai food promotion where they invited chefs from Bangkok. The normal spread was delicious and fresh enough. The Thai food promotion definitely makes dining experience there more special. There were a few dishes which we never tasted before like the Red Curry with Roast Duck, and Yellow Curry Crab - that tasted super good. There are several credit cards that offer promotion with this restaurant, so remember to ask before making payment. DBS currently offers 25% discount. With the lovely presented colourful dessert spread (there were a spread of Malay, Chinese, Western and Thai desserts), you will be spoiled for choices. The restaurant is quite big in terms of layout, so if you like seating not too far away from the dishes table, do make a special request when doing booking. A round table for 10-12 pax is available if you are planning to dine with a large group

Aquamarine at Marina Mandarin hotel boosts on serving a great seafood spread especially for it's dinner buffet. I was disappointed and hasn't been disappointed ever since I start to frequent this place since 2009. From fresh tuna, salmon and taro sashimi to large cold cut prawns and Alaska crabs, the spread might not have changed much but it is consistently fresh and regularly replenished too. The dessert section pack quite a spread too especially the durian themed sweets, quite a treat
5
I recently visit Aquamarine for its buffet lunch. The reason behind my choice was its Halal certification as 1 of my guest was Muslim. The theme for the month was Thai and I must say the authenticity of the food was impressive. I don't think they missed out on any Thai dish. Food quality was good and the variety was excellent. The cold cuts were fresh and the sashimi station was delightfully fresh too. The waitress serving us was always present to attend to all our needs, my glass of cold water didn't have a chance to reach half as she was always on-hand to top it up. The restaurant was spacious and cool and when it came to settling the bill the staff was kind enough to let me know of a credit card discount they were offering

We had lunch buffet yesterday at aquamarine .The foods were very good & quality.Thanks to the management for making muslim enjoy the buffet.Wide choice of Thai dishes.Durian lovers.

4
Wide array of choices, international cuisine. very spacious and good service.
Definitely worth recommending.
5
Excellent seafood dinner buffet.. Fresh large variety of seafood, and the nicest thing is its Japanese food variety. I can't stopped eating the sashimi, tempura... and the fresh oysters! The desserts are nice too...
5
we had the buffet on the night we arrived; everything you could possible want and more; local dishes such as Singapore crab; beautiful indian curries; plenty of fresh salads; soups; and the desserts were fantastic; help yourself lollipop tree awesome!
1
Quality of food from spread to coffee was terrible and definitely one of the worst I've experienced from a hotel rated 5 stars.
5
So glad they went Halal!Went with colleagues Dec 2012 and just had to get my girls and their fiances to experience the place for themselves. The Weekend Buffet is sumptuous especially the cold salad bar...juicy oysters and other seafood,exiremely fresh and abundant. Wide choice of Asian and Western dishes. Sushi lovers indulge! It was tough choosing the dessert as so many simply called out to be sampled.Chocolate butter pudding with vanilla sauce is a must! Cosy and friendly ambience.We had a corner table for 5 and felt quite 'exclusive'. The staff were very attentive..drinks top up and dishes cleared very promptly.Requests for coffee/tea/bill was attended to immediately.Definitely value for money..strongly recommended for friends/family gatherings

Aquamarine is located on the 4th storey of the Marina Mandarin Singapore to the right as you walk towards the front desk. Spacious with well-spread out tables that can sit from two to more than ten people, one can hardly miss it as you walk pass the Atrium Lounge. A service excellence role-model for Aquamarine's team members to emulate, Rachel was all smiles when she greeted us at the hostess stand and graciously showed us to a strategically-located table in the middle of the restaurant, close to the buffet spread. Outdoor tables are also available for those who prefer fresh air.The Halal-certified 'Ocean's Catch' international buffet spread was extensive. Though not really one for seafood, I was nonetheless spoilt for choice as I had the Thai (som tam, etc.), Japanese (sushi, etc.), Indian (mixed vegetable curry, etc.), Malay (mee siam, etc.) and Western (turkey breast, etc.) cuisines to choose from. The spread was laid out very orderly. The Japanese food items were separated from the rest of the spread. Seafood took pride of place and occupied a huge area in the centre of the restaurant, to the left of the dessert counter, with the appetizer and the spread with main dishes on its right. The dessert selection was just as impressive...ice kacang, homemade soya beancurd and durian pengat, etc. were available. To round off the meal, teh tarik and coffee awaited us. I would highly recommend Aquamarine to anyone with a huge appetite for buffets. The spread is well worth the price one pays

I had the lunch buffet @ Aquamarine yesterday. $58++ per person is waaaaayyyyyyy tooooooo expensive! All the cold dish were tasteless! Local delights.......I could have paid $2 flat and had a way better tasteing chicken rice and mee reebus at a hawker center or any coffee shop. Being a "foodie" I'm really disappointed and feel cheated. I'm shocked such a restaurant in such a hotel is serving such food! This restaurant deserves no ratings at all
4
Food choices were good, they the usual spread- chinese, japanese, american mostly chicken and some beef. Best to get up early (630am) to avoid the rush (9am) so it doesn't get too crowded and you'll have a hard time flagging the waiters for coffee and water. Staff was excellent though, very accommodating and attentive
5
Lovely food and excellent choice, both Thai themed and western food on offer. Chicken sausages at breakfast, but rather tasty. Plenty of fresh fruit and cakes if full English not you thing.
3
Ok if you just want the typical hotel food. Better places to eat that are not too much further to walk!
5
Very diverse selection and a great way to start your day!
1
Overpriced and food was not in the right temperature. Hot items are always lukewarm. Top up was slow and container always empty. Quality of food is worth less than half the price they are charging. Not worth going at all.

nice place for seafood lovers
4
This restaurant served a lot of seafood, all fresh ones, and if you are a seafood lover, is really value for money. However, I am not a seafood lover, as I am allergic to all seafood almost and so only went to this restaurant 2 or 3 times a year with my family. Otherwise, the other variety of food is not that bad either

I was invited to dine in this restaurant with some friends. And considering the feedback written on Tripadvisor on their food and service I must say that it is indeed worthy of such praise. The buffet spread was fab, fab, fab! I must have eaten soo much oysters to the point of a medical condition should I have continued. Bit it was that fresh and succulent! The dessert was colorful, playful and decadent. They had little ice cream cones filled with yummy chocolate mousse and some excellent mint chocolates!Service was impeccable! The servers looked after us well, making sure that our plates and tables were clean and cleared in a respectable time. The manager of the restaurant was hovering amongst the tables and had offered to assist me when I had taken some food from the buffet.All in all a wonderful meal in itself.Now something that does not normally come from my reviews. This does not speak about the restaurant directly but had an initial effect on me prior to dining. I was seated in the lobby prior to dining as I, along with some friends, had come in a little early for dinner. During such time, someone from the hotel had approached us. It has been experience that in general most people would inquire as to how they would assist you should they come across guests, however as you will later note it would seem not in this case. As we were not boisterous, nor unrully we had felt the attitude showcased to us was not warranted. The staff, who we later were informed was the Duty Manager of the hotel, had approached us and had asked verbatim "Are you in-house guests?'. We had replained that we were not and were dining to dine in the restaurant. Afterwhich he simply walked off with a curt "ok". This made me fume! And as mentioned had set me off to dine in a sour note. I had inquired from our server if the person in question (who was still situated in the lobby) was their Duty manger to which he had affirmed. On requesting to speak with the gentleman in my table the server had approached the DM (Duty Manager) and upon returning had said to me verbatim "he (refering to the DM) would like you to go outside to speak with him instead". In cartoons, this point in time the person upset would be depicted having steam come out of their ears, if you were to depict me upon hearing this I would have steam, fire and my color would be red HOT! So i had somewhat argued with the poor server to insist that the DM come to MY TABLE as I wanted to speak with him. He finally came and when I had inquired what was the concern when he had approached me earlier on and he just replied blandly that he was just inquiring if we were in-house guests. My retort to him was if that were the case and as he had walked off later on without anything else but and OK then he should have inquired if we needed any further assistence of the sort. I had some words further with him on how i believe he should have handled the matter further. As he had no words thereafter I had told him that my friends and i were offended and wanted an apology, it was only then that he had apologized (however somewhat reluctantly). When I had asked him for his business card he had replied that he had no business card! Then when I had requested for him to note it down somewhere he had left but had not returned!!!!!! Unacceptable. Nonetheless, i had found out his name was Mohd. So should you encounter this particualr gentleman, please be on your best behavior less you endure my frustration that evening

We ate at aquamarine, me, my hubby and our 6 year old son. We used to travel a lot and normally can benchmark the service and food quality of this resto. The food variety is not so good and there was a time when the dishes were not replenished immediately. food taste is also just okay but not the type you will come back for more. however, one thing good is the service at each table of the waiters

I had a very unpleasant experience there 2+ weeks ago. My mum decided to buy me a birthday lunch there, and I'm a cardholder of the Eat@Mandarin card (not to be confused with the Eat@Meritus card which is of a different color). When it came to the bill, the restaurant insisted that I, as the cardholder, MUST PAY for the bill, and not my own mother. And they kept insisting that theirs equals the terms and conditions of the card. The T&C of the card states that "cardholder must be present when dining to claim the privileges of the discount". No where does it ever states that cardholder must be the one making payment. Even after I pointed out that mine isn't the co-branded OCBC/Meritus card, their staff insisted that I pay. Which I had to in the end. Follow-up email exchange with Eat@Mandarin and Marina Mandarin led to a very curt reply from the restaurant, where Aquamarine's manager insisted that his staff offered to take my mother's credit card for payment. That is never the point. The point is that Aquamarine simply creates an unreal and unfair trading term for diners at the restaurant, and it particularly targets dining cardholders.For the record, I never even received an apology call from this terrible restaurant. And I have been using various dining cards for the last 5 years. This is the absolute first time I have ever encountered such a ridiculous requirement imposed by a self-proclaimed 5-star restaurant in Singapore.Stay away from this place!!!
