Went here on the recommendations of friends who came before, but not a huge fan of the fusion flavoured burgers. However, the decorations were very nice and it does have a certain appeal as a burger joint.

Absolutely loved the burger! Simple and tasty! Recommend asking for fries with truffle maionese but maionese on the side...

New chic burger place in town. Loving the interior but limited seats. Ordered the Bomchika wow wow burger [$10.90] and it is definitely a good choice.

The burgers are mostly asian styled flavours and comes with interesting side choices that are different of other burger joints. It is somewhat like mos burger but a little “ oilier”. Price is between 6.90For single burger . For set meals the price will go up to 12 to 15. But overall good food. I like that they have salads which is a good balance of die

Run by the same people who own the Benjamin Barker chain of men's clothing stores, this is probably their first foray into f&b. The restaurant serves Japanese inspired burgers and shakes, sides and ice cream. I had their basic b burger at $6.90. Portion was small but they do put a bit of effort into the burger- buns were toasted and the addition of daikon was novel. Definitely not the burger that changed my life but a nice competitor to burger king and mos in the same building

My orders took about 10mins.....Tried their Karate Burger S$7.90, added S$3.50 for a drink and a side. I chose the Wafu Ramen slaw (salad) which came out to a very small portion, quite disappointed. Saw other diners in the restaurant who chose the fries, portion was way bigger/better compared to the slaw. The burger however was a bomb! It comes with sesame black charcoal bun and the Sriracha honey sauce was generous, slightly on the sweet side. The Daikon pickles in the burger was very crunchy adding different flavor and texture to the burger. Now the best part of the burger, the deep fried Karaage chicken stays crunchy and juicy till the end of the meal albeit soaking in the rich sauce. How did they do that??Overall, it was a very filling and satisfying meal. I would definitely return and try other burgers
