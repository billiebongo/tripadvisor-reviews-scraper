Surrounded in a rather dodgy neighbourhood but food is exquisite. Try the white pepper carb or salted egg yoke crabs here super nice. Prefer the ones with the eggs

Went to this restaurant last week, recommend by a Singaporean. Food was good but very expensive. Staff enerrtaining even if little English was spoken. Highly recommend the signature dish "white pepper crab" different taste from the normal Singapore style
But delicious

We had something small to eat before coming here.We only really wanted to try the chilli crab we also ordered fried rice noodles.The Chilli Crab was nice, sauce a bit on sweet and spicy side. Sweet buns that was additional charge was a bit too sweet could be better a bit plain to counter with the sauce.Overall satisfied with the experience, crab prices are high per market rate ($80 per kg)Seating is not indoors, more open with fans

This was our second time at this restaurant. Ambience is nice, busy, staff is more or less friendly, bit forced. Food isn’t anything special in Singaporean standards and value could be better. This is a pricy restaurant.Most horrible thing was that after the meal we both started feeling bit nauseated, indigestion, was our first thought. Within 1,5 hours we were both vomiting and having severe gastroenteritis that lasted throughout the night. This was one of the bad ones, we’re still recovering from this incident 24 h afterwards. No matter how the service or food is, but if you end up poisoning your guests it is bad for the business. This was our first stomache bug in Singapore, and we’ve been eating in hawkers and stands quite a lot. Not acceptable
2
We showed up at 5pm and were the 2nd people there. There were about 5 staff that unfortunately weren’t too proficient in English. We had been referred to this place by our hotel concierges at the Shangri La. Our experience started with them pointing to a plate of peanuts and a pre-package hand wipe and asking us if we wanted them for $3 and $1. (I’ve never had to pay for a plate of peanuts before, ha!). Long story short, the staff were not friendly at all and any questions we asked seemed to put them out. We ordered the chili crab and the sauce it came in was tasty but the crab itself was not very flavorful. At 80 Singapore dollars I had hoped it would have been better. It was not worth the price at all. Feel free to give it a go if you want to, maybe you’ll have a better experience than we did. I should have trusted Trip Advisor and not the concierge ;

The best chilli crab we have ever had, juicy,succulent, full of flavour and went down well with rice or the buns. Pepper prawns were also amazing with a great peppery and soy flavour which was great on its own. It is best to get your hotel to call up to try book as we went the first time with a good table in the front with good and fast service. The second time on New Year's Eve, we were told no booking was needed however, we were put at the back which was a garage with tables so the ambience was not the same facing the washing up kitchen bit.......nevertheless this is worth the trip just for the food alone!Service was not the best 2nd time round but it was New Year's Eve and as usual they were busy, however it would help if there was not only 1-2 ladies to take food orders as most staff seemed to serve drinks or clear tables

Went to this hidden gem with friends and were not disappointed.They have an amazing selection of all kinds of seafood and it tastes amazing. We had both the white pepper as well as chilli crab which were really great. For desert we had awesome mangosteen and durian which both were juat as good as they could get. Especially after having mediocre experiences in various hawker cwnters as well as other restaurants, this was a pleasant surprise despite that it is on the expensive side (somewhat same like every other place in Singapore
1
Somebody recommended this place to us and we followed his recommendation. We were totally disappointed with theWhole experience The restaurant we went to at marina (esplanade mall) was not clean, the ceiling was stained with black marks. The waitresses were not trained and hardly spoke any English. The bill was tremendously expensive especially in relation to the quality of food. I had lobster which gad a thick sauce inconsistent with the product, while my wife had crab. They had no Wi-Fi. The bill came at 380 sing dollars and charged us 2 sing dollars for two towels
3
Visited this modest restaurant on my last day in Singapore and I must say the Chilly crab is flaming good. If you wanna try local food than this is one dish you shouldn’t miss. The service though is not impressive and the waiters speak very basic English.
2
We foolishly went to this restaurant in search of Singapore’s famous chilli crab. Well, the prices were just outrageous. $200 Aus for one crab!! We had chicken wings and rice instead and it still cost a bomb. They also charged for the boiled nuts that they put on the table and the wet wipes that they provided instead of serviettes. That’s just plain greedy. I’m sure the food is good but if you really want an authentic Singapore food experience, try Chinatown, Little India or hawker stalls.
2
My Amsterdam friend & I came here around 10pm,
We ordered 3 dishes and 2 glasses of lime juice.
it cost S$ 200
4
Good seafood in authentic Singapore Chinese style. Service is better than before and seemed more expansive than before, anyway, happy to have good food.
5
This restaurant is primarily attended by locals of Chinese ethnicity. Rarely you will find foreigners. The food is simply amazing. Highly recommend the pepper crab, and the Hong Kong style steamed fish. The fried rice is really good as well.
4
Brought here by friends. Restaurant not fancy but excellent crab (and bamboo clams and prawns). Very friendly and attentive service. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner!
1
Finally reached to the restaurant at Esplanade and start to place order. The lady take order mentioned to me “there is no more Sri Lanka crab” ？？？？We reached at 7:15pm then no more??? She should have mentioned over the phone when she take a booking! Very bad service!
4
Overall the restaurant is nothing fancy, however i really liked their seafood, in specific the spicy crab. It was fresh and amazing. I also had fresh coconut to go with it, which was not the best thing I've had, but lots of people like it. Crabs are expensive, probably because it is a touristic place, but it was worth it
5
No Signboard seafood Amazing Real Fry White Pepper Crab which is Best when we compare with Jumbo on river front Clarke Quay. We really suspect Jumbo are not real fry. Just dip the Crab into hot water to make the Crab cooked than fry a while with Black Pepper to serve.Only the shell cover with Black pepper
5
Every time me and my family go in Singapore we make sure to be able to visit the best Seafood Restaurant in the city.Our family love the Chilly Crab as well as the Creal Prawns. I would come back always to have a taste of this 2 exquisite cuisine.
4
Made a special trip to this restaurant based on ta reviews . Definitely worth the journey. We had the chilli & the white pepper carb. Both were delicious. Service was courteous and polite. And they have taken notes from ta reviews and placing down small plates and telling us there are Small charges so we are given options .
4
My husband went bfr and loved the chilli crab. Its very messy to eat but you get a bowl wt water/lemon and a wet wipe ( extra charge). The service was quick and efficient. The portions big. Wine selection not great and overpriced. Feels like you're earing wt the locals which is nice.
5
No Signboard has many branches but my favourite is at East Coast Park .
I like the Chilly Crab sauce and steam /friend buns cereal prawns .
Get ready to get dirty and eat
5
Great food and attentive service. White pepper crab is a must try. Do make table reservation if you are going during the weekend.
4
This is a much better outlet compared to the other one at Clarke Quay. Service is fast and friendly and food is good too. More variety of food besides crab. Do try their Fried Hor Fun with seafood.
5
Big Sister and I had a lunch reservation in one of the Jumbo Seafood restaurants. Fortunately for us, the taxi driver talked us out of the Jumbo Seafood and convinced us into trying No Signboard Seafood Restaurant at Geylang instead. The mee hon crab was truly delicious and filling. The crab meat was just packed into one whole crab and it took us sometime to finish a S$67.00 dish. Veggies/drinks/disposable towels plus the mee hon crab including 10% Service Charge and 7% GST came to a total of S$98.40, pricey but affordable lunch for two. Be careful of the "add-ons" which they will bring to your table and politely ask that you don't want them because they add up when your bill is presented
4
Singapore is well known as seafood paradise. No Signboard is one of those cook delicious seafood that you will go back again and again. For this time, I will saw the management enhance on the service and I'm very much appreciate it. Nice food + great service is we always looking for. I will recommend the white pepper crab as is one of their signature dish. Keep up the good service and I'll be back very soon
4
This legendary seafood house at Geylang district is one of a must to visit for a local Singaporean cuisine experience. It offers lots of local seafood dishes that make Singaporean dish one of the world's great food. This includes spicy crab, black pepper crab, fried glory morning, and oyster. Nearby in Geylang there is a frog porridge that also quite yasty and worth a try.
5
We went there after watching a tv series in which great chef David Muñoz enjoying the chilly crab at this wonderful spot in Singapore!We ordered a small cereal lobster,small barbecue prawns and chilly crab. We have to say that we were delighted by the flavors and the sauce of the exquisite chilly crab! We actually ordered more mantous to end up with the delicious sauce!! The lobster was also super good and tasty and the same for the prawns!! Total €136 including the soft drinks!We were really satisfied!! We highly recommend this place!!

I found this place in all the tourbooks as the place to go to for white pepper crab. I went with some clients and we made a night of it. Crab is about $SD70 per crab, so a little pricey. But it was spectacularly delicious and so fresh and unique. It was like crab I had never had before, a ting of peppery spice but not overwhelming at all. Our group had a mixture of other seafood dishes, even crab fried rice (a new one to me) but quite delicious too. Service was mixed, the place is frenetic, mostly locals in the know it seemed but some tourists came later on. Hard to get servers' attention, to get simple things like forks and napkins or refills. Food took a while but the place is always slammed.The place at this outpost is just in a courtyard and has no real ambience like a restaurant might have, perhaps that is part of this place's edge/charm. There are four of these now all over the City but everyone says that this location is still the best.Quirky in that the place charges $SD 3 for nuts appetizer on the table, and 60cents for a crab apron and 60 cents more for a towel to wipe the crab off your hands. There are reviews about whether this should be built in to the charges, others say that these charges go to tip the servers further. To me, I found it odd that a place that charges about $100 a person USD charges $3 USD for these items separately. Plus it was hell just to get another napkin or two.Restrooms are down a hall behind the kitchen, so you have to walk by and through the kitchen to get to the sink to wash your hands off further. Go for the crab, but be mindful please that there are some quirks there too which are completely foregiveable given how perfect the crab was
5
The food here is pretty good and I definitely prefer Geylang to the other outlets. I've been to a lot of seafood/crab places in Sihnapore - Jumbo, other no signboard outlets, red house, Long beach, Hawkers. This place along with Keng eng Kee are on my favourites list.I've been a couple of times and the last was in a group of 15 so I've tried a fair number of dishes. Some of my favourites:- razor / bamboo clams cooked with garlic. Always a delicious appetiser / side dish- white pepper crab, salted egg crab and the crab beehoon (with soup).It's hard to recommend which crab is best as this depends on personal preference. - Seafood fried rice (decent portion with a generous serving of seafood
4
I was there with 2 more friends and we did order 2 crabs ( about 1kg). and we must try our best to finish it. OMG !!!! It is toooo much !!! and yummy of course.Although we must wait a bit long to enjoy these crabs, but it was desert. I'll come and try it again in next retur
4
Come to this restaurant 8 years ago. Outlook still remain the same with just slightly renovation. Service improve a lots. Come to this restaurant must their signature cook crabs.
5
Recommend by the concierge and it lived up to its reputation. Chilli crab was fantastic. We also had buttered prawns and they were good too. Service was very attentive even provided some stockings for my wife for her blisters!
5
Of course it's famous place with chili crab. So should try at least 1 time. Everything is fresh, clean, big and tasty. The smallest crab from 1kg up. You can choose the crabs that are swimming in the tank. Crab sauce served with dumplings

After researching and finding some excellent online reviews, we opted for this restaurant to savour traditional Singaporean crab and seafood.We were a party of three, and one of the few tables to be seated initially. One of the many waiters recommended that a set menu for two, at $268 total, would be enough for three. This was the case for us, though not if all three people wanted a juicy crab claw. The scallop & vegetable, grilled fish with chilli sauce, white pepper crab and dessert courses were tasty enough. But not outstanding or particularly memorable. The staff were ridiculously over-attentive at first: removing plates as we were still chewing our last mouthful, and rushing out the courses. We asked the waiter not to remove plates that we were still eating from, then the service went opposite: no plates or debris were cleared for the remainder of the meal!We ordered three beers which were replaced quickly and methodically without asking; this dedicated person also swiftly tipped current drinks into new, cold glasses. We felt somewhat bombarded.It soon became clear that this was a slick operation which, in all likelihood, is capitalising on being famous and has lost the essence of why it became so successful.The bill, including the beers that we lost track of, was $360 for 3. Given the food was just ok to good; the waiting staff were robotic and rushing us; and finally, the restaurant was basically set on the pavement under an awning; we were very disappointed

My wife and I spent about a week in Singapore and one of the main objectives was finding Chili Crab. We did the usual stop at Jumbo's which, while good, was hardly memorable in my opinion. No Signboard doesnt have the same location off the water front - by subway you can get to it easily from Aljunied off the EW (green) line.. its only a couple of blocks south from there and obvious from the street corner.Most of the tables are located outdoor and will easily accommodate parties of 12. There is also a VIP section that we didn't opt for as the weather was nice and outdoor was preferred for us.They will serve you peanuts in the shell that I believe have been boiled in brown sugar or cane to add an interesting sweet, but not overly sweet, taste to them. I think they were $1-$2 for a plate of them. Bibs are less than a $1 and wet napkins are around the same. If you are painfully frugal... just bring napkins and all that.The Seafood Hor Fun was really good - made slightly bland and then served with a chili/fish sauce condiment that sort of tasted a bit like Thai Kimchi. This allowed you to add as much heat/flavor to the noodle as you wanted. The lobster, squid, fish and so on was very fresh and expertly prepared - not chewy and over cooked like the Scallops I got at Jumbos that were also overly greasy. We also enjoyed some Asparagus that was also perfectly al dente and trimmed/skinned expertly. So in all - if you are looking for something other than Chili Crab this place is FAR superior to Jumbo's with the exception of location.With regards to Chili Crab - the wife opted for the White Pepper Crab and imho this is far superior to the sweet chili crab we got at Jumbos - but to be fair, that may be a matter of taste. What is NOT a matter of taste is I felt the crab was better cooked here and was juicy and tender. The initial bites are sort of disappointing.. if you were expecting an assault of pepper. However, once you get a little further in the white pepper flavor really starts to perk up and it compliments the crab very well.Our Crab was about 1.2 Kilos and at the time cost $80 SD/Kilo. The service was very good here with a group of people cleaning off plates (busing) and constantly scanning the dining area for a raised hand or needful look. In contrast to Jumbo's where I nearly needed to throw utensils to get attention and then remind people when they forgot. They do nickle and dime you on some stuff that I thought was petty given the cost of the crab but this does seem standard no matter where you go. The location doesn't offer as much as a riverwalk location but isn't that far from everything else - so I thought it was worth the trip.As far as the crab I felt it was superior to other options... it was perfectly prepared (which is not a preferential statement) and I prefer the white pepper to the traditional chili sauce (which is a preferential point). They allegedly pioneered the White Pepper Crab - and given my experience, its clear they are pretty good at it. The value seemed better and the service was far, far better than the 'famous' option

The restaurant is known for the various types of crabs they prepare. We tried both the chili and steamed varieties. They ran about 80 Singapore dollars per kilo. There was no accompaniments with the dinner. We ordered the crab fried rice and found it to be very good. There is also a bun they serve that is very delicious. Things to be aware of:1) the place some peanuts and peppers on the table when you sit down. This will cost you $3 Singapore per person if you eat them.2) They did not provide silverware, only chopsticks. Nor do they provide any tools or silverware other than a cracker to open the crabs.3) they do not provide any napkins for dining. You have to purchase a wet nap type cloth for .30 apiece. 4) peak time is after 9 pm and the restaurant is packed. We got there around 8 and waited about 10 minutes for a table.5) the restaurant is very casual, almost like an outside food stand. No roof, just tables and chairs. The dress of the patrons was very casual
4
I was a member of a party of ten and I really enjoyed my meal. The very informal atmosphere and attentive, unobtrusive service worked well for our group. We had three different kinds of whole crab dishes and a fish dish. All were very good. I would recommend No Signboard for an informal evening out with friends.

Visited this after hearing many good reviews on instagram with particular mention that it is better than Jumbo (I have never been). Went with 2 friends and it's name is exactly like, there is no signboard for it and so can be easy to drive pass and miss it (apparently the street that the restaurant is located on is a red light district however I didn't notice anything to suggest that). Once inside, you'll know you've got the right restaurant. There is a charm to the restaurant set-out with plenty of room to move. The food itself lives up to its reputation. A great selection of seafood to pick from, their menu was huge although I will note that there was a fair few items that we were advised were 'sold out' or 'not in season' which was a little disappointing and led me to believe they may no longer simply serve the dish. We went ahead to order their famous singaporean crab dish we which thoroughly enjoyed and beats any other version we've ever had in Australia. We also ordered their popular 'pepper style' crab as well - BE WARNED, this is not for the faint-hearted, it is a true kick in your face pepper flavour and my two friends could not bear more than 1 piece, it had them sweating more than the Singaporean humidity. I was a huge fan of it though and finished it. I truly recommend it to those who can handle their heat. We ordered a couple of prawn dishes too (butter cereal and steamed garlic, with a unanimous vote that the butter cereal came on top by far. Sambal belacan was delicious and very authentic. One of the biggest drawn down about this restaurant is most definitely price. In saying that, we pay a lot more for seafood in Australia so I didn't not have much issue about pricing and was happy to pay what the bill came to (roughly 280 Singaporan dollars for 2 crab dishes, 2 prawn dishes, 2 mantou buns, sambal belacan dish and beer and coconut juice for all of us). What was annoying to me though was that they charge for everything. We were asked at the beginning if we wanted peanuts at the table (with no indication that it will cost us) and replied yes thinking they were complimentary but later found they charge us for this on the bill. They also charge for wet paper towels and even paper bibs, to which we all purchased as our crab dishes necessitated it. This surcharge could've been made the more acceptable if they had simply just added it within meal prices. Do not visit if you are expecting to have a cheaper to moderate priced meal. However if you are happy to part with some extra money, you will enjoy your meal here..and were able to grab a table fairly easily on a Sunday night. Service was prompt here with waiters aplent

I wanted to try Chilli Crab in Singapore and "No Signboard" is one of the famous restaurants in Singapore for the dish including Long Beach and Jumbo. We ordered several other dishes which all tasted fine. Service was adequate. The Chilli Crab was fine too. The main downside was that the 3 main restaurants, not just this restaurant charge very high prices for their food. I would say the meal was worth about 1/2 of what we paid. If price is no object, then by all means go ahead, but having been in Vietnam and Bali on this trip, I think its not worth it. I recommend going to the hawker centers where meals cost around 1/10th of the restaurants for a real taste of Singapore

Crab is supposed to be a specialty in S’Pore… So being in town for two days, I wanted to give it a try. After hours of screening numerous foody websites and scanning comments and addresses, I ended up choosing the most-mentioned name, recommended also by our Hotel concierge, the “No signboard” on Geyland Road. On the bright side, although obviously a popular place, it was filled with Asian guests rather than Westerners, and the seafood looked, indeed, very fresh. However, I didn’t like it and would not recommend it. First, because the atmosphere was loud, bright and rather hectic. And mainly, because the only philosophy under which that place seems to run, is making money. The peanuts, brought straightaway with your drinks, the bread rolls with your meal, the beans added to your dish, and the pocket-sized paper napkins afterwards…every single thing in this restaurant will be billed unless you specifically refuse it at the beginning. The same applies to your glass of beer being relentlessly refilled or the heaviest crab landing on your plate (price is per kg). So that at the end, even though the cooking was allright, the bill was quite “salty” (about 160 SG$ for two small crabs (a Black Pepper one and a steamed one) , a fried and a plain rice, one set of napkins, bread and 4 or 5 beers)
4
No Signboard Seafood in Geyland Road is famous for their Pepper Crab though they also offer Chilli version. Their dishes are done well with good taste
4
Excellent place very popular!!! We asked the waiter for no chili and he advised "double less". It was still too much!!!
next time will take triple less...
Great food, great experience and what else...
Go and try it
4
This is probably one of the very famous restaurant in Singapore grew from just a hawker stall without signboard so that what's the name come from. The spicy crab is their famous dish. At the moment, I prefer any local restaurant in any hawkers center. The taste is not authentic anymore
3
I understand the Chili crab is a specialty but this time is was rather bland. Just tasted like chili without seasoning. We also had the meehoon crab which was pretty good. Chili prawns were also better than crabs. the rest of the dishes like vege and fried rice was average. A bit pricey too
4
Took our daughter and boyfriend for their first experience with Singapore Chilli Crab to NSS. I was keen to try the White Pepper Crab - which is apparently a creation of this restaurant, although this is widely debated on the net :-) . We also ordered the black pepper crab, drunken prawns, rice, the soft buns and some bottles of Tiger beer (in my view the only accompaniment for Singapore Chilli Crab!). NSS is set in a noisy open courtyard on a relatively busy street. This is part of its appeal, relatively comfortable but still with that hawker hustle and bustle. The Chilli crab could have been a little more spicy for my tastes, but this was soon remedied with some chopped fresh chilli. The white and black pepper crab were lovely. Succulent juicy flesh with a great balance of spice and heat. The prawns were a bit bland but again, a little chilli in the stock lifted the experience. I wonder whether they had us pegged as chilli newbies and tailored the order accordingly. In any case, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would visit again when in Singapore. NSS has two other locations but we chose the one in Gaylang for a great 'local' experience
4
Decided not to opt for the more expensive crab option (or the bullfrogs!) and slurped our way through a large plate of chili prawns instead. Very busy restaurant so would advise booking ahead. This are of Geylang Rd is not exactly pristine, far from it but its worth getting your shoes dirty to dine at this place
5
Enjoyed the Pepper Crab - washed down with plenty of Tiger Beer. The food was excellent, the beer was nice and cold (and to ensure it remained cold the beer glass got changed for a replacement ice cold one at very regular intervals), and the service faultless. Would agree with other reviewers about the price being somewhat high, especially when dining solo. A white pepper crab shared between friends as well as a few other dishes would be a much better option, but I was on my own. Still I am glad I spent the extra bit for the crab to enjoy the flavour, as well as the atmosphere of the place
3
Service is very good and the food was quite alright. However, the price is not so alright though. Price is on the high side as you can find cheaper seafood in other restaurants in Singapore. However, there are many tourists who will visit this place and they offer valet parking as well
4
went there because my friend said you have to try the white pepper crab. It was really good. Enjoyed it quite a lot.The other food was also very good and enjoyable. The service is good and attentive. Overall its a good place to go and enjoy with friends
5
The Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab served here needs to be nominated for a Nobel Prize. I have dreams about eating them both again. The menu also features a whole sweet and sour fish that would be a standout anywhere except where crab is King. The menu also features more taboo items like Shark Fin Soup. In the end, it allows a Chili Crab experience at a price point that is reasonable surrounded by more locals than tourists and the chance to see your dinner alive and swimming shortly before it is prepared for consumption. The service was attentive and friendly. The seating is outdoor and informal. The location is busy, loud and bustling, but fantastic for a casual meal.
5
No frills just excellent seafood and the glutton in me couldn't stop eating. Fresh fresh ingredients, well prepared and cooked with mind blowing sauces and flavours, a must!!
4
One of the best seafood restaurant in Singapore...IMHO ). Local style, local kitchen. Chilli Crab is highly recommended.
5
We ordered the black pepper crab and crab with rice noodle. They were delicious. I am greatly impressed that the waiter noticed that my son (2-year-old) was sleepy and provided a movable bed for him. It gave us a great time to enjoy the crabs.
5
we had a very nice business diner.
Crabs and lobster are amazing.
Service is Ok.
It is little bit overpriced
4
Best to eat here with a group of friends - not just to share the huge portions of the food but to also help foot the bill.It wasn't "life changing chili crab" for me but i would probably want to go back, if someone will treat me here :
4
We came to No Signboard Seafood as a recommendation to experience the most authentic chilli crab/pepper crab in Singapore. The restaurant was not too crowded and despite it being outdoors, it was very well maintained. Seafood Hor Fun (recommended dish) was pleasant and easy to eat. As main, we tried their chilli crab as opposed to the pepper crab which is raved as their original recipe. Be warned - the price is quite hefty here. 1kg=80SGD for crab, and often they are sold out on their smallest size. We were offered 1.3kg, which is probably the next best thing, but still rather costly for a crab that size to cost 100SGD. The taste was exotic to us, so we enjoyed it for what it was. Wet wipes (and peanuts) are not complimentary, but we made do without asking for more. If you want to cut down the bill even by the slightest, a good tip might be to wash your hands in the bathroom or bring your own wipes. Overall it was a fun experience
4
When looked at the environment and the menu, I was a little bit shocked by the high price. E.g. Chili crab is double price of Lau Pa Sat, however when the dishes were served ,I changed my mind immediately, the crab,prawn and vegetables were all very in good quality,fresh,tasty,can't stop eating ..
4
The pepper crab is really good, while the chili crab not really my cup of tea (ps i can eat very spicy)The oatmeal shrimp is also good, so as the coffee ribs.Price is quite expensive, same price among different branches. However i think they have different portion for the same price in different branches. The crab size in clarke quay branch is much bigger than the promenade branch
4
If you wanna to eat and taste some excellent seafood , here you're . No signboard @ Geylang in singapore is the cheaper and nice seafood you can enjoy with your Family or with you Friends , especially the "salt egg york fried with crab "or "chili crab" are very Nice taste . All my friends come from U.K. Also say excellent taste never eat or try before , and he orders another 2KG of saltyork fried with crab they like the taste. First time I see them eat too much of seafoods non-stop.  So next time you come to Singapore looking some seafood restaurant , come to ( No Signboard Restaurant @ Geylang ) is the cheaper restaurant in town . I recommended you'll and try i

Went here with a friend living in Singapore. White pepper crab was a standout, favourite thing we ordered. Food is fabulous, seafood is fresh. Great chilled out resto located in a parking lot! Service was fantastic and they actually serve wine! They also kept replacing the beer mugs with cold ones throughout the evening - nice touch! Defo worth a trip out here for dinner
5
Outdoor seating and crabs to die for. A bit further out but well worth it. Certainly a more authentic experience than Jumbo although that is also great.
4
The price is expensive but it's worthed to quality and taste. It would be much better if the seafood is served along with white wine (HaHa).
5
Great restaurant and reasonable price for Singapore. Very authentic and traditional flavors and good chinese food. Nice place and gighly recommended if you are looking for Traditional Singaporean flavors!
5
Pepper Crab was excellent, the dishes were great. Much better than East coast seafood. The beer was fresh and cold, well mixed beer of Tiger with Guinness Stout as recommended by a local. I will choose this place in future over East Coast. The beautiful young at heart beer lady was extremely attentive (see picture)
2
Sorry if we were not satisfied. The food were good but not worth the price. Average service. The chinese girl (boyish) who served us was a little bit arrogant. Better to eat at hawker centres than here but if you want the famous Crab then be ready to empty your wallet
2
We were following the reviews and a friend's recommendation but came away less than satisfied. Being charged for sweet peanut nibbles was one thing, but to also be charged for the hand wipes after eating Chilli Crab is really gouging the mug tourist. Eating whole crab is a VERY messy business but no bibs or even napkins were offered, although others seemed to have been provided. The atmosphere was more attuned to a petrol station than a cafe/restaurant, yet the place was packed!! Nevertheless, our service was disinterested. More positively, the crab was fresh and tasty and the Tiger beer wasn't over-priced. Beer value makes it two stars
4
I really want to like this restaurant - it's local and full of character, it's buzzy, has nice service, a great legacy story (poor hawker's stall that couldn't afford a sign board) and an appetising menu. At the end of the day my score is a reluctant four (with a downwards pull to three) on one account - a couple of the dishes we tried (as well as the peanuts) were far too sweet. OK, so the chilli crab has a touch of sugar but steamed fish with a gloopy sauce ? That's just wrong. On the other hand the spicy kang kong was excellent, the bamboo clam was precisely cooked and the fried squid delicious. We eventually gave up on the mains and polished off the starters instead. The beer is cold, the atmosphere fun, the utensils plastic and you can sit in the VIP room if you prefer a cooler environment. If you wish there are some expensive imported ingredients as well as shark's fin soup, unfortunately, which I think should be banned from all Chinese menus worldwide. Locals seem to eat earlier, foreigners a little later. So, do try No Signboard restaurant if you're in the Geylang area but choose wisely and make sure the waiting staff understand your preferences - for instance, the pepper crab would be a much better choice than the chilli crab if you don't have a sweet tooth (and don't mind white pepper)

We visited whilst on business and spent about 3 hours eating and drinking here. We tried both the pepper crab (white pepper I would say) and the chilli crab. We had some fried rice and oyster broccoli and quite a few Tigers ! The crabs were excellent and around 2kg each. A very enjoyable evening which for three cost a little over sg$400 so not cheap.
3
We came here based on recommendation of our taxi driver. We have previously been to Jumbo for chilli crabs so was looking for something cheaper. As this restaurant was in Geylang was expecting cheaper food but crab was priced at $80 per kg. Wonder how much Jumbo in Clarke Quay charges nowadays as this seemed quite expensive. Also ordered a bamboo clam, deep fried bullfrog cooked in butter, chilli kang kong and a tiger beer. Total cost was approx $125. Chilli crabs and frogs were good.
4
The two dishes I order every time - the white pepper crab and salted egg crab. Not every No Signboard branch offers the same flavours, so I only eat at the original Geylang outlet.The crabs are awesome, and all the other dishes are yummy too. I agree with the other reviews that they are pricey, so do go mentally prepared. Service is mediocre. They expect you to know pretty much what you want the second you sit down. If you ask to take orders later, it will be a challenge getting their attention again. Not every waiter/waitress takes orders, so you need to find the 'right' one. If you value great service, don't visit. You'll be a repeat customer like me if you know how to deal with the impatient wait staff and just ENJOY the food
4
I came here to get my fix for their crabs and seafood every 3months or so. Good fresh seafood, many tourists and locals. Pricer compare to local coffeeshops but cheaper than seafood restuarants like jumbo. Expect a long wait during peak periods.

Authentic place in Singapore....
White pepper crab and Razor clams will make your day..
Booking is highly recommended
Wine menu is a disaster....so just bring your own bottles and enjoy your dinner
5
Simply amazing. Peppered crabs the best I have ever eaten. Clams, baby squid, steamed shrimp in garlic. All perfectly prepared and served, swimming in flavour, great service, highly recommended for authentic Chinese food at its best

Our uber driver highly recommended this place, calling it Singaporean's favorite spot. It was more expensive than we thought (maybe because we were initially headed to the food center), but we were not disappointed. The famous Singaporean crab was delicious, and the Crab was big enough for 4 of us, with some cereal shrimp (this was another great choice!), large fried rice, and some buns. Recommended if you stay in the Geylang area
2
The meal wasn't bad but the price to performance wasn't justified Cereal prawns was good Crab was overcooked Coconut water was fresh Mango we had was also good but nothing spectacular Damages were around SGD 150They charged a 10% Service Charge which I think is steep for a non AC establishment where even tissues were charged separately

제일 저렴한 스리랑카산은 언제가든무조건 없다고할 확율이 크고요. 나름 직원을 믿고 메뉴추천을 받았는데 그게 화근이었네요. 호주산 마리당 338싱달러짜리를 추천할줄이야.. 영어가 짧은 외국인을 상대로 180싱달러/kg 이라고 설명하고선.. 물티슈 2.4싱달. 그냥 테이블에 처음부터 올려있던 간장종지만한 사이즈의 땅콩 2.5싱달. 콜라가 무려 11.8싱달러입니다. I visited vivo city branch just four days ago with my husband. I asked one of chubby woman staff to recommend the chilli crab and she told only two crab. from Austrailia and from Alaska. I don't know whether she intentionally hid it she had other crab from Sriranka or not, but it's already famous of their frequent gimmick. and I had to pay S$338 for it. and apart from that I have to pay for using even wet tissue. and we had to pay the peanuts 'just' on the table. too far fetched their strategic gimmick.
4
There's a bit of a queue so be prepared to wait. We tried the chilli crab and it didnt disappoint. It was tasty and cooked just right. I just wish they have bigger space to accommodate guests. We stayed in a make shift dining area and it somehow loses the ambiance.
3
I visited this joint on recommendation of staff of the hotel I was staying in . I ordered Singaporean crab with plain rice for two of us along with a vegetable dish . Thank God I did not order anything else because we had to make effort to finish it washing it down with a few beer bottles. The whole meal was a good experience compared with other restaurants we ate in . The service was fast n we had the luxury of choosing the crab . We also ate Indian style crab in a restaurant in little india but I won't compare . It's apples n oranges story all over again

This outlet being there for many years. At situated at a busy junction with vehicles and human traffic. My last dinner over there was almost 10 years ago. We left the place without eating even though we had ordered the dishes as we waited for 1 hour nothing turn out.It has queue system which registered your booking and many seats for your turn. There is valet service for customers who drive, if not you have to park very far away.This time we had reserved for 3 tables serving yusheng, cold dish, steamed fish, cauliflower with mushroom, leek, crispy prawn with oats, crabs, mee goreng and fruits platter.Overall the dishes are average in term of taste, and presentation. The crab presentation is the worst. Service is above average. After 11:00pm there are customers coming for seafood. Maybe is the brand that attracts customers
2
I was referred to this establishment because Palm Beach was not available. I went to the establishment and was given a seat outside. I told the waitress that I was not familiar with the type of presentation their menu offered – dollar values for a volume of seafood. As a single person I said I cannot eat a lot of food but I would like to try a couple of things. I was recommended the scallops with XO sauce and chili garlic shrimp. The server asked if I would like rice and I said, yes a cup. She sold me a $20 plate that would serve 4-6 people. The XO scallops were good, the garlic chili shrimp had no flavor and were cold and again I had a plate of rice for six people. The bill they presented me with with the addition of a bear was $120 Singaporean. When I examine the bill, they had double charge me for my shrimp portions. When I presented this to the staff, they laughed and said I will take care of that and remove it for your bill. For a single person they have six or seven scallops, six shrimp, fried rice and a beer for $115 Singaporean, or $80 US was ridiculous. Taking advantage of foreign tourists with the mediocre product is not a good business model. I would avoid no signboard seafood at all costs. Walk over the bridge and pay fair money for excellent seafood at Palm Beac
1
Almost two time more expensive than other even have better taste sea food restaurant.
How come they have such very high price while another restaurant with same quality of crab but cook better with a fair price
4
Busy restaurant with a wide variety of seafood dishes. Service was prompt and helpful. The food was very good.
4
Great food and great chilli crab but it is expensive now I have been going there for years in fact every time I go to Singapore but prices are now very expensive and actually there are better places to get chilli crab at more affordable prices
3
Went here after multiple recommendations from locals and was expecting something more tasty and of course cheaper. The prices are steep at $80/kg for crab. We were a group of 4 and you'd expect some good value to feed us but I was sort of disappointed. Had to try to the chili crab of course ... which was very meaty but the sauce was overall just tomato sauce with a kick of chili. In addition for a vegetable go the sautÃ©ed potato leaves which weren't bad. Would not recommend this place as the go to for chili crab...I'm hoping to try a different place soon. We also had fried spicy pomfish (not spicy) as well as fresh coconut juice which is amazing on a hot Singapore day
4
This place is not chic in fact just the opposite but the food is the most genuine and perfect if you like spicy and seafood combos. In the heart of the largest red light district in Singapore it sits on the main road and while there are tables inside you go here to sit outside and people watch and eat the chili crabs and chili prawns. Nothing else like in Singapore. Stay away during bad weather and they are open in the evening. This is the origianl place and while they have opened similar places in the better parts of town you come here for neighborhood ambience and the absolute best chili crab and prawns I have ever had anywhere. It will seem rushed as there are so many people who show up here and it is first come first served so just hang have a beer and when your time comes it will all be worth the wait
4
Very local feel right smack on the busy Geylang Road. Crabs and other dishes are good. Try the fried flat Koay Teow with seafood. Great "wok hei". This is by far a better outlet as compared to the other one in Clarke Quay.If you are not out to impress someone, you should order crab that is about 800gm and not those that are a kg or more. Flesh texture is far better.. The Chicken soup is very good too..
2
We ordered a 2-kg crab and the waitress told us we could try different tastes by dividing the crab into half. To my surprise the two dishes of crab are two 1-kg crabs. Do they know that a 2-kg crab is not equal to 2 1-kg crabs?!
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by some local friends. Here you can dine semi al fresco and be around the hustle and bustle of a crab/seafood joint in the traditional sense. The menu was very varied with everything from croc (no lie), shark, and frog legs...but of course the crab steals the show. The chilli crab and the pepper crab were the stars of the show. We also got some sides of Hong Kong noodles and fried rice. Our guest brought their baby daughter and she was catered too perfectly as were all of the other families with small children. That was the best part...it was a place for everyone! One tip you think the crabs look small but they are filling....start on the small side and then work your way up if you are still hungry! An remember to have the Tiger beer...frosted mugs and ice of course
2
This run down restaurant (ducted tape seats) reminded me of mainland China in the 80's.Food is traditional but VERY un-even. We had a very good mango fried chicken and coffee pork for example... but the supposetly spicy rice or noodles we ordered were mediocre at best.The greens were overloaded with fish sauce...etc.The thing is it would be O-K if it was cheap... but the noodles themselves were at 20$ and didnt worth 2!The service was very kind but overwhelmed... and the place was empty.... If you ask how we landed there in the first place : it was our hotel reco as everything else was packed
3
If you don't mind paying S$80 a kilo for, what to be fair is excellent crab, and then being asked to pay extra for each serviette, then eat here by all means. Beware that the small basket of fried mushroom that is gratuitously placed on your table when you first sit down, is NOT free! It will cost you three bucks. There is, not so subtle, continuous pressure to drink lots of beer
5
Had a team of people here. Two chilli crab morning glory and deep fried baby squid. Excellent service top quality ingredients and convivial atmosphere. Highly recommended.
4
Very popular as food is great. Famous for its crabs. Pricey but a must: Chilli and White Pepper are my favourite. The place is not fancy but the seafood is fresh and good quality. Location is in middle of old Singapore and popular with locals.
5
I was totally attracted by dished of this restaurant. The crab dishes are beautiful and marvelous. It's a pity that you come to Singapore but not try food here, delicious till the last.
5
We absolutely loved our food - child crab, white pepper prawns where the highlights. Service is fast and friendly an it's a vibrant local atmosphere. Don't expect table cloths and fancy things - just great food at a reasonable price.
4
This restaurant had got two branches located at 414 Geylang Road and Esplanade. If you looking for ambience, air-conditioned and service, go to Esplanade. Signature dish: Chilli Crab. In my view, it's the best and you must not miss it! Lots of Chilli Crab has got more of tomatoes taste than a balanced of chilli and tomatoes flavour. To me, No Signboard had got the best flavour you can ever find in Singapore! Try it and you will not regret it. Price wise is about $65 per kg.
4
No Signoboard Seafodd isn't a fancy seafood restaurant. It's rather more like an open fish market where you can eat freshly cooked fishes, shells, etc.The service is quick and efficient (don't expect too much smiles though), the menu features a wide range of dishes, the ingredients are fresh, the prawns are awesome, the scallops as well, and the prices are quite ok
5
We went on a workday and luckily didn't have to queue up which is usually very long during weekends. The couple that established this restaurant literally introduced crab to the inhabitants of Singapore as a delicacy. They didn't have enough money to put a signboard in the beginning until their customer base was built. During that time it was difficult to identify this place as there was no signboard. Eventually it was named 'No Signboard' and few regular guests helped the couple to put it on.Apart from their chilli crab and other great seafood, I loved the cheese oyster a lot
2
This restaurant is referred by many people for the famous chilli and white crab .Don't waste your time and money there are much better place in Singapore to indulge into the famous crab wagon. The ambience is like one circus tent, some of the seating are partially outdoors, no frill table’s some laminex some timber, and no tablecloths. The service is a complete shemozzle I guess that is the Asian Chinese style. The price for seafood is overpriced, the service is terrible, not from the perspective of being slow but pushy and aggressive. It’s ridiculous. Very disappointed overall a very uncomfortable experience.
4
Taken by an ex-pat friend and loved it. Highly recommend the fried baby squid, chilli crab and sweet and sour prawns. Crab was expensive and staff were horrified when we couldn' t eat it all, they kept offering take away options! Would definitely go back another tim

No Signboard SeafoodHow was the name conceived?It was a name given by our customers!Back in the late 1970s, we started our stall at the Mattar Rd Hawker Centre without a signboard. Since cooking had been my forte, Ah Kaw and myself decided to make it our means of livelihood. I concocted the recipe for the white pepper crab while Ah Kaw cycled down to Tekka Market to buy our supply of live crabs. Sales started with only about 3 crabs a day.Back in those days, selling seafood in a hawker center was uncommon. Eating crab was much less popular unlike today, where the chilli crab has made its way to be the unofficial â€œnationalâ€ dish of Singapore. So I suppose we were in a niche market with the success of our homemade white pepper crab.The other critical success factor would be the endless word of mouth advertising that our customers did for us. They spread word of our tantalizing white pepper crab and referred to us as the stall with no signboard.The rest of the credit, I have to say goes to my culinary skills and the fresh ingredients I used. Since 1981, we have relocated and expanded no signboard seafood around many parts of Singapore.A Singapore Food Institution with 4 Branches Dotted around the CityAs the Names Suggest Seafood & more Seafood Crab in Varieties of Style- Chilli, White Pepper or Garlic & Chilli are the main Staple

Great seafood
Best Alaska crabs ever eat. Funny and tasty drunken Shrimps. After 2 bottles maotai somebody at our nice table round try to communicate with Shrimp in same condition.
:-).
4
Good food, but definitely priced for tourists. 1 spicey crab is $80 sing. Pay for napkins, peanuts and wet naps!
5
This location is not in center of city but easy to get via MTR. The walk in the lane from MTR to restaurant also interesting buildings and can see local people life. Seafood well cooked and pepper crab a must! Barley water drink good company and durian shops around if you want more
4
We had dinner at this place two years ago with my son and daughter in law and that was super so we went there with the whole family 2 weeks ago and it was so nice! One chilluh crab and one black pepper crab and of course a lot of other lovely dishes as well!Er was niet veel meer over toen we zeer voldaan vertrokken!
3
We visited here after the Concierge, cab drivers and others had said that this is the best crab in town.Firstly the service is terrible, not from the perspective of being slow but pushy and aggressive. I understand the concept of cross sell/up sell but to be harassed with a big menu in your face for dessert when you're still holding chopsticks and eating your crab is ridiculous.Not sure if the waitress saw $$ signs with the tourists in town but she coincidently recommended the most expensive prawns and most expensive fish by pointing to it on the menu but interestingly when asked, she couldn't elaborate ... SUSS ... Yep!!I don't need the flash surroundings to enjoy great food, but this place doesn't have either. So down to what we really came for, the CRAB ... we ordered the Chilli Crab (too much Chilli and no balance with the sweet flavours you can get elsewhere (eg Jumbo at East Coast Park) and the White Pepper Crab which was so peppery that the delicate flavour of crab was lost.Don't bother with the hype! I think the legend is in the name which is the most memorable thing for me
1
The way they seated us and demanded our order by standing next to the table and immediatly scribble down orders we didn't want, was so unplesant we left after drinking our beer. Price per kilo, crab around $80 Singapore dollar a kilo, while you can eat for a couple of dollars in the neighbourhood! Maybe no crab, but very Nice meals that come with a smile
4
We came here for dinner as recommended by our friends. As reviewed here the crabs with salty duck egg and crab roe sauce was exquisite. The deep fried bun could also be dipped in the silky smooth duck egg and crab roe sauce. In comparison to the crabs of similar weight in Newcastle or Sydney NSW Australia, this is far more tasty with relatively cheaper price. We would definitely recommend this seafood Resturant to anyone who is traveling here.
5
Literally the best crab I've ever ate in my life. I stopped by here with my wife during over layover on the way to maldives. We ate lunch at tien tien chicken and I wasnt impressed after enduring their ridiculous long and sweaty line for overrated haiwanese chicken. Anyway I was already half full but my wife insisted we had to stop by no billboard.Thank the sweet heavens we did. We order the black pepper crab and the chili crab. You willl want and need to have both crabs because the chili one has a thin sauce where you can slurp which is very succulent, while the black pepper version the sauce is thicker but the flavor is out of this world crazy good.People say the place is pricey, but it is very well worth it. I miss the crab so much, 1. Good crabs2. Pricey but who cares3. Will come bac
3
Reading from the reviews online I was so excited to come here. But disappointed! The food is bland and very simple to my taste. You can get much better food at the hawker centre around singapore and much cheaper. I guess you pay for the brand name but nah...don't bother! Have to pay peanuts and tissue too? I mean really? Not happy
4
Took our in laws here,,,not sure what they made of the place to be honest.The bad things are that it is open air, with ceiling fans, so very very hot, no air conditioning here! Plus for a first timer its a bit of a culture shock being away from the city, and faced with a rather daunting looking menu.But we dived in (it was our second visit), we had lovely king prawns, noodles, rice, vegetables and of course, a big chilli crab with a load of the delectable sweet buns. By the end of the meal we all looked like we were bathing in chilli sauce.The food was great, the service was fine (a bit surly and abrupt, but nothing unpleasant) and the bill was 'reasonable' (for Singapore). Also - for kids they will be fascinated by the massive tanks of Crab, Lobster, Prawns, fish and all manner of creatures, you walk past them on the way to the Loos
4
Signature cuisine is Chilli Crabs. Try its and don't forget to ask waiter for plastic gloves!! I'm not sure this restaurant able to access by train or not. Our SG friend drive us there. Enjoy Chilli Crabs!!
5
The best place in Singapore to eat fresh lobster, crab or any seafood that takes your fancy. Great location, very fresh tasty food. Very busy, be sure to book
5
We googled this place before coming, and we were not let down. Every dish was yummy, with a big plate of chili crabs, shrimps with herb soup, grilled oysters and fried buns. Definitely recommended
3
I remember how this place used to have this killer white pepper crab....and unfortunately, that will just remain in my memory.
The place has lost its edge.....white pepper crab is nothing close as what it used to be...
5
I know some prefer the chili crab at Long beach or Jumbo, but to me no sign board at Geylang serves the best of chili crab. Crab is fresh and the seasoning is just right. The fried rice and fried vegetables are also quite nice.
4
I actually have been here quite a few times in the past and decided that it's time to really spend time and write a review about it. As you might have heard, this place is famous for its chili crab. And they really earned it because the chili crab was really really reaaaaallly gooood. Almost always ordered chili crab, mantou bread, steamed rice, and Thai coconut for drink. Even just to put the gravy on top of a bowl of steamed rice and put it the mouth was already heavenly! The restaurant is spacious and suitable for business dinner, celebration, or even just for casual eating out with friends/family. Can be quite expensive but it was totally worth it. If you're looking to tase some Singaporean chili crab, this is one of the best place to have it
3
My husband and I arrived at the restaurant at around 9ish, after we checked in to our hotel. We ordered white pepper crab, steam prawns, steam garlic lobster, abalone sashimi and stir fried kang kong. The white pepper crab was small and a tad too hot for our liking. Not sure if this is supposedly the 'right' taste . . . but doubt I will order this dish again. Other seafood dishes were so so. There are so many seafood and zi char restaurants in Singapore, I guess I will give other restaurants a go
3
We had chili crab during our recent visit, it was $80 per kg plus 10% services charge. To be perfectly honest, the dish is great. But after later visit to other hawker centres, where we again had crabs, I'd say having crabs at No Signboard is fairly overrated and not worth it. At hawker centre, you can have same quality and taste for $50 per kg and no service charges. And more likely those hawker centres are closer to where you stay at nights
3
I was here with a friend and it's quite pricey for 2 people. We ordered 3 dishes: one chilli crab, salted fish fried rice and eggplant. The chilli crab was really yummy, and the bread to dip the sauce was very good too. However, when the waitress brought out the rice, she told us they got the rice wrong, instead of salted fish they gave us yang chau fried rice, which was cheaper. I told her that was fine but she had to reflect it in our bill but she didn't seem to understand us. Another waitress came over and said we ordered salted fish so we had to pay the salted fish price and insisted that the dish on our table was salted fish fried rice. I told her we were happy to pay for what we received, and that the other waitress informed us about the wrong order. The 2nd waitress gave the 1st one a deadly glare and took the dish away. She then returned with what we swore was the same dish she took away a moment ago, with some tiny little fried fish on top. That was totally dishonest!!! And their signature eggplant was just some fried-slightly-coated-in-batter eggplant, i.e nothing special.Will I come back? The crab was yummy, but no I wont be back because of their service. It's also quite pricey; $95 for 3 dishes, food only, no drink no wet towel.Tip: bring your own tissues and then wash your hands in the bathroom, the wet towels they provide are useless
1
Very surley unhelful waitress took our order reasonably promtly then forgot about us for ages until we asked for a glass of water , food came after a long waite , chilli crab was terrible , no serviet only small dosposable wipe like supplief by kfc and found out later they charged us $2 for these , ordered wine was not seved until we had to ask again , bill was a shock and rude staff , suggest find somewhere else
5
Best chilli crab and cereal prawn in SG! Tried their fried enoki and it taste good too! A little bit expensive but worth it.
4
I have been here with the family. We did try cod fish and chilli crab. The meal was nice. Yet it was expensive though especially beer.
3
The seafood are average... Nothing special... Crabs are ok.. Price a little steep... Service is quick and not personal.
5
No Signboard, as the name suggests, is a simple restaurant located about 20 mins away from the Orchard road area by MRT. The journey was easy and took us to an area that was no so touristy flashy. It felt like an organic area. The food at the restaurant was to die for. Seafood is never cheap but this was worth every penny. The service was top notch with plenty of cold beer and attentive service. Just come here
2
The waiter and waitress is very prompt and efficient. But the food is not nice, particular to chilli crab. To the worst, when the bill came, the waitress ask me for feedback. In short, they are not sincerely getting feedback from the customer, just out from the routine. And to the worst, waitress told the cook is too busy to test the food, the manager told me the boss had test the food and said it is ok to standard. It is so obvious lying
2
Initially seated very quickly, Very good menu and fast service....initially. Crab is very expensive expect 80 dollars for a small one and about 6 large tiger prawns for 35 dollars.BEWARE THE PEANUTS ON THE TABLE WHEN YOU FFIRST SIT DOWN ARE NOT FREE. Seems like a scene from LA airport back in the day or on the tube in London when there are pencils or paper on the seat and if you take them you are asked to give money. The little hand full of peanuts on the table when you arrive are $3 so do not think they are free, this is simply a trick as they are there when you arrive. so you assume they are free. TAKE YOUR OWN PAPER NAPKINS. They will charge you about $2 dollars for a tiny packet of 1 disposable paper wet wipes so take your own, they DO NOT OFFER FREE ONES!!! total scam. We ordered some crab, fried rice and shrimps. All were delicious. then we noticed other things. NO WHERE IS A BOWL OF STEAMED WHITE RICE ON THE MENUE, but locals were ordering it, we were never offered so spent a lot more on fried rice. LITTLE BREAD ROOLS, we were never offered them but noticed locals also eating them and they were $2.50 for 6 we would have had white rice and bread rolls but not on menu and never offered , we only noticed after we had finished the meal. Then served a beer which was over chilled and frozen was told it was "great" and cold, put up a argument to get a beer not filled with ice. Then tried to order another beer almost impossible to get service, then tried to order dessert, Almost impossible to get any help and then dessert missing wafers which were in pictures. Cleaner working on table next to us dropped a plate of chilli sauce and chilli paste ended up all over my pants, shirt and our sons shirt and face. Got a sorry and a free wet wipe!!! Difficult to find someone to give us the bill, bill finally arrived I asked where I had to pay. Then spent 5 minutes sitting in Silence as the poor girl could not under stand me and we had to wait for another server to come and say "over there" So would not go back. fried rice, small crab, 6 shrimps, 3 beers $150

Ordered the famous white pepper crab, a dish of veggies and tiger beer.The atmosphere is so unique, open air. It looks like those hawker with 4 shops but actually is one restaurant separate in sectors (kitchen, other kitchen, Indoor area).The man who attended had really strong accent in English that I could hardly understand. White pepper crab was delicious, strongly recommend. But as much as you eat the mess becomes bigger and they are not fast to provide more wet towels so might bring some tissues or something.The Tiger beer lady came with a new and cold glass when I had drank half of the glass and flow my old beer into the cold glass and added more beer from my bottle. Which was surprising as I thought she was going to do something with my beer but it was nice and somehow logical. I would love to try other plates.Yes, I strongly recommend here

We tried the No Sign Board restaurant at Clarke Quay. 3 of us chose the set for 2 pax and an additional vegetable with mushroom dish. The set includes lobster in butter, abalone, fried shrimp and crab. For crab, you can choose pepper sauce or chili sauce, we chose white pepper as it is said that this restaurant is famous for that one. The lobster is small and sweet, the sauce is nice and I just wish to have Vietnamese toast to use with that. The abalone is with oyster sauce, the abalone is good but the sauce is a little salty. They fried the shrimp with some flour and salt which made it really tasty. The pepper crab is nice, of course, but I don't think it's so significant. I think the pepper crab at Eng Seng restaurant is better. The staffs are nice and helpful. However, it's too pricey. It cost us S$450 for all above with drink and tax and service fee. If the cost is not an important part, then this will be a good choice.
5
Our cab driver recommended the place at Geylang, being the original outlet for eating crabs, frogs and croc steak. The tastiest black pepper fried crab I have ever had. The difficult part was to get the meat out of the crab without having to soil both hands. At the end of it all, it looked as if we were out to massacre a little crab and do justice to all the meat it had since were paying SGD 80 for it !!!At SGD 40 per head , it is an expensive place. And I dont think that their outlets in the city would be any more expensive than the HQ in Geylang. Keep an eye on the tab
5
We went to the location on Geylang St - it was amazing. Very authentic - you sit outside and are waited on by the very attentative staff. They have other locations - that are more modern, in doors and air conditioned but we wanted to go to this location for the old Singapore feeling. The chili crab is OUTSTANDING. Best we had there - and we had A LOT of Chili Crab. They have beers and that's about it at this location. If you want cocktails you may have to chose a different location. The seafood is super fresh - you can see them in all the tanks in the restaurant
5
The chili/white/black pepper crab all super and love it so much! The rice drink also very good company. It's close to metro station and easy to find. There is also durian shop nearby if you got the appetite afterwards :)
2
the food is definitly good, but totally overpriced, service so, so, and they try to make you order a lot so you get a huge bill.
5
Been a year or two since I last visited this family favorite, and yet things already appeared better in my latest visit. More staffs speaking better English, responsive waiters and waitresses, overall the service has improved since my last visit. And then the menu, they keep offering new stuffs, good new ingredients and same quality cooking.
3
Took taxi ride there. arrived at around 7pm. Place was very busy but table was available.5 Waiters crowded our table with menu pushing us to order drinks, food. Peanuts and towels on table.Decline if you dont want tp pay for it. Expect to pay for tap water. Went to kitchen to pick Crab and weigh it. agree on price when you pick. So much staff but still had to wait. Crab was good. veggie was fine. staff kept pushing for drinks. Overall not to bad but not place to go for nice slow dinner. In and out in about 1 hour
5
This place is famous for Chilli and Pepper Crabs. Other food is also good. Good place to eat and enjoy. Spacious so you do not have to cramp and the food is served well.If you need local food, this is a good place to visi

I went there with my group ( more than 20 peoples) so before arriving we already made reservation along with foods order. we made it clear all the orders via whatsupp . Everything was okay until food served. guess what? they multiplying the quantity of foods that we had ordered. crab was multiplied by 2, and the other food was multiplied by 3. and when we order tea they gave juice. it was a mess. they keep denied and told us that they only serve what we ordered until i show them the conversation we had. it's look like they wanted to took an advantage from foreigner. really disappointed so i wont recommend this restaurant. Sorry.

We were recommended this restaurant by one of the hotel staff as we wanted genuine and not rip off tourist chilli crab. It is a cab ride from anywhere as it is not easy to find. The place is almost like a cafe or cafeteria with room for 100's and they fill it all the time. You can see the crabs, fish, snails, etc in the tanks so you know everything is really fresh. The menu is endless - they even have bull frog done 10 different ways - and you can see the live bullfrogs out with the fish. The meal was about $140 with a full crab, an entree and a chicken main meal as well. all over - great value and totally genuine chilli crab. They are also famous for pepper crab as well

I went to Singapore for a few days and I've heard the chill crab here was amazing. However I went with my girlfriend for a late supper. We arrived at 9pm. As soon as we sat down we were asked if we was ready to order. Like they was rushing us to leave or something. But anyways we order the chili crab and some others dishes. The spare ribs was terrible and hard it was probably cheap meat. But anyways the crap was average nothing special. At 10:30 the waiter just put the bill on the table and left. He didn't bother explaining that he need to close or anything. Very disappointed didn't expect that in Singapore

Enjoyed a seafood dinner at night and a couple of rounds of tiger beer. This restaurant was large and well ventilated (Undercover, outside). The menu had good variety. I ordered the famous Chilli Crab, some steamed fish and a rice dish. Food was tasty and well presented.

I had read about the Singapore Chili Crab and resigned to try it whist visiting Singapore. We were recommended this restaurant and tripped along thinking it was a slightly better version of the street food option. The restaurant offers inside and outside seating and we elected for outside with the superb evening lights and a kaleidoscope of activities going on in front of us. Very busy restaurant with efficient waitresses. The waitress quickly recommended the right crab to order and advised we didn't need much else. We had seafood rice, and some stir fry vegetables and that was it - with a beer and a coke! Well the crab was large and the wonderful sweet crab meat was well worth the money - combined with a very good child sauce. The seafood rice worked well with it. We wore one of their bibs - which saved our clothes as it is rather a mucky job really getting all that meat out of a crab! All in all a fast and busy restaurant that specialises in seafood and delivers an accomplished service with good quality food. The meal for two with two beers and one coke came to 238 Singapore dollars! But we really did enjoy the meal

Amazing fresh and big Salted Egg Yolk Crab! Ordered a Bull Frog dish, it was pretty good too. Pricey but reasonable in the city.

If what you are looking is to move from the tourist and expat places and get some insight of what Singaporeans enjoy get a cab and go to this Geyland location. This is not an upscale place in terma of decor but food and prices certainly are. Very casual and good for families. We ordered diferent types of crab (see attached fotos) and all of them were outstanding. You have to be a little adventorous but will not be dissapointed.
5
Girlfriend took me and my partner hear to have the famous Singapore Crab - pepper (too hot for me) and Chilli (my fav).Great backstory why this restaurant is called no sign board and we were the only foreigners present.My partner doesn't eat seafood so chose chicken dish which was just as delicious as the giant crab. Enjoyed the crab with a side of rice and wine/beer (which was cheaper than some places in Singapore but not as cheap as hawker centers).Great experience- would return for a fun messy night of good food and company. You get to wear a big bib for your meal so don't worry about the mess :

My wife and I went to this area to experience another side of Singapore.We went to this restaurant for a late lunch. The flavours of the seafood, the noodles, the rice and the vegetables were very good. The ambience is one of casual, partially outdoors, laminex or timber tables, and no tableclothes. The service was very good. The price for seafood plates seemed excessive and incongruent with the ambience and setting and quantity of seafood on the dishes however, I could be wrong and there could be a valid reason for the high cost of their seafood. The price for non seafood plates seemed congruent. In summary the food was very good in terms of flavour. This area was a very interesting eye opener for us, as we have never ventured away from the marina tourist area. We walked back to the marina area. Duration of the walk was approximately 50 minutes
4
I sometimes order take away if my wife feels like "eating out at home". I think it's the owner who picks up the call, and she is always very chirpy on the line and helpful with suggestions.We like the bamboo clams and salted egg prawns. We sometimes order the steamed oysters as a treat, though not cheap at all. Their carbs like fried rice or noodles are nice, and they usually only cook the veggies when I get there to keep it fresh. Very nice touch.Overall good quality but not the cheapest place for seafood
5
My imagination told me "No Signboard" would mean it would be very difficult to find - umm the signboard is the length of the building! So the No Signboard Seafood has the biggest signboard they could get!! The food is excellent, chilli crab with the little buns, so yummy If you need a place to eat that is quite close to the city, jump in a taxi and go her
4
Always nice taste is drunken herbal prawns. It is very tasty. I like to go this rest. in Geylang rather than other outlet. It feels authentic for me. The service is nice. I would recommend to go this rest. like group so you can enjoy many different kind of dishes. It will be worth it
3
I still can't get over the fact I paid 300 for 1 x crab ; 1 x fish and other small items for 3 people. Location is central and it's great place to bring overseas guests for dinner. It's a good alternative to the usual touristy places such as East Coast
3
After couple days of western food, we have craving for Chinese. My daughter specifically asked for soup noodle, so we came to this Restaraunt as its walking distance from our hotel. The food is not bad. A bit pricy though. We sat outside so that the kids can run around. Atmosphere quite good outside.
2
We were referred to this restaurant by our hotel but did not have reservation. We were not treated well. Our table was in front of the kitchen and the servers ignored us for quite awhile.The coffee encrusted spare ribs were over seasoned. The service was poor and the wine tasted very old. Overall a very awkward experience. There were many outside tables that would have provided a better time
5
Really good sea food here. Slightly off the beaten tourist track and a good authentic feel to the restaurant. Staff are friendly and a good place to grab some cheap tiger beers.
3
The expense of the place takes the gloss off the food. Good, fresh seafood but at astronomical prices.
5
The butter is so good you have to order for the second round. Don't forget to ask for the fried little golden bread and dip into the sauce.
4
Love this place, always busy and you have to wait to get a seat but well worth it. Mark down for price and location only. Love the sweet and sour pork ribs, also great chilli crab.
4
When it comes to food, everything boils down to your taste bud. If you are driving, the restaurant offers valet parking for $4. Possibly cheapest valet parking around.Food was served within 10 min from our order. The last item to arrive was the crab which took about 25 min.We preferred their signature white pepper crab to chilli crab. Price for crab was reasonable at $108 for 2 reasonably sized crab (around 800g to 900g each). Their staff was attentive enough to top up the beer, clear the plates, fill up the tea cup, etc without being asked.Price may not be cheap but definitely cheaper than dining at the seafood restaurants in Turf City
4
Had lunch here in April, was very quiet at the time as it was around 2:30pm. The food was pretty decent and fresh. Reasonably expensive, but it's Singapore and seafood generally carries a higher price tag. Had the chilli crab after reading a lot of positive reviews and it was really good. Staff were constantly looking at us which was quite uncomfortable to be honest. For three of us, a crab, lobster and spring roll starters with a few rounds of beer cost us a little over $400.
4
This was my second time visiting this restaurant and it truly is a fabulous place to go for fresh seafood in Singapore. The ambience is authentic and the taste is truly awesome. The only drawback is the quality of the restrooms and the hectic activity of the waiters causing you to wait a bit too long for service. Highly recommended for all seafood lovers who accept a rustic ambience
3
This large, busy eatery serves up a wide array of seafood as well as pan-Asian dishes. The interior is pleasant and open, and faces the famous Singapore Merlion Park. After each item on the menu, there are three prices. The lowest price means that the quantity will feed 2-3 persons--and that means it's impossible to order for one person, and two persons are not likely to finish the dish (such as fried rice). Prices are extremely high but the food is well prepared. Try a smaller restaurant if you are dining alone or with one other person. Be forewarned that ordering with a group may rack up your bill to an uncomfortable amount
4
It was my first time eating here ... First I think that I will get lost just to find the restaurant .. But, luckily someone told the direction and just go with him .. When I asked about the name of the resto and chilli crab he don't know. But, he asked to follow him and promise to take me to the best singaporean chilli crab. And luckily that's the one that I'm searching for. Good taste for the chilli crab but not to hot. Good taste also for the seaweed soup and also the famous oyster ..
2
A Chilli crab and a salted egg yolk crab cost us $206! In addition to the ee-fu noodles, kai lan vegetables and cereal prawns + 3 tiger beers and 5 cups of Chinese tea, our bill came up to $397! That is ridiculously expensive although the food tastes good. My advice would be to go to some other seafood restaurant for probably half the price.
2
We ordered chilly crab, kangkong, mantau and ice tea and we had to pay 131 dollar for 3 people. The crab was quite big and taste was so so. I kinda regret had dinner in that restaurant since it's really pricey...
3
Ok place
Food is ok but very pricy.
Best still the chilli crab.
Little rip of with the towels.
Better places to eat arround gaylang.
3
Came here to try out the seafood as told we have to try it. My parents have been here once before but didn't try the crab so decided to give it a try again. It was 3rd day of Chinese New Year when we came so the place was packed.Service - Very fast and efficient service. The staff were friendly but the food was too slow in getting served. However, when we ordered, we were told upfront it would be 45 minutes before the food will arrive so we were warned. Lucky we were not in a rush because it did take that long to come.Food - Chilli crab was a bit average (not as good as others according to my brother and sister-in-law) but their white pepper crab was amazing. That is the one they are famous for and it is great. Most of their food are good and the portions are decent as well.Value - It is quite pricey to eat here but I guess it is worth trying it out for once.Atmosphere - No atmosphere at all when you are seated out back where it used to be a carpark. You don't come here for the decor or atmosphere, that's for sure.Location - Taxi would be the way to get here. No easy public transport here.Overall - I personally wouldn't come back to here as I'm not a big crab fan and my family (despite their love for crab) wouldn't either. Worth a try just to say you have tried it

We were here past midnight for supper. I was informed that this restaurant serves the best chili crab in Singapore. Second only by Jumbo restaurant in East Coast. The crab was huge and very meaty. Despite of the size the crab was sweet, usually big crab tastes a bit bitter. Service just ok, this is a place where you are after the taste of the food not the service nor the ambient. The chili crab was awesome. I'm coming back again for sure
1
We were so unbelievably disappointed by this recommended seafood restaurant. Right on the harbour waterfront, this crazy busy place simply does not have enough staff working to provide even a mediocre level of service. The food certainly isn't bad, but nothing to justify ridiculously overpriced dishes. Water is charged at $0.80 per glass and served in plastic beakers. UNBELIEVABLE when they charge $$$$ for their dishes. Similarly, wine is so overpriced it's laughable. The night we attended was fixed menu options only. I have rarely been so unhappy with a dining experience and wish we'd walked out earlier. Oh, I forgot to mention that it took over an hour for the first dishes to be served. Will never return or recommend
3
... popular restaurant, quite a lot of hype about the crab menu. our verdict: average taste at a premium price. barely met our high expectations, sadly. service was great and staff were nice but we've eaten in restaurants with great tasting crab dishes with extremely reasonable prices... unlike the No Signboard. i can recommend only if you have got nothing to do with your excess money, but if you like excellent value for your fish then this isn't the place.
4
Several ten of years restaurant already. They are famous for their chilli crab and fried bread. I feel their fried rice is good also. But their prices are 20% higher than others. They are located at Geylang , after food , men can alway talk a short walk to look at pretty women because Geylang is a red light district
2
We got there without any reservation in advance, so we had to wait in line (about 45 mins). We had to wait some extra time due to someone just jump in the middle (which they missed their turn by going somewhere and some other people - I guess friends of someone). Finally we got into a one of many tables in the inside which have been available since the time we arrived.Next part is the food waiting which took too long, and other tables come after us got the crab before us (is it because we don't speak their language?). It's good that the chilli crab worths the waiting even though the price is a bit pricey (S$80/kg excluding tax and other extras)
1
Horrible food. 浪得虚名 . The Salted Egg Crab, they gave me a dead crab. as in, the crab was dead before slaughtering. One bite on the flesh and I immediately want to puke. Next, ordered seafood hor fun, it taste just the same as those you can get at normal Tze Char stall. But price, $20.00 per plate! Even Boon Tong Kee selling at $16.00 a plate taste SOOOOOO much better. Chilli Carb, so so only. I can anytime pick a stall doing better Chilli Crab than No SIgnboard. Next, Pandan Chicken. I don't know if they really know what this dish is all about. They wrap, or rather ( COIL, would be a more apt description) 1 leaf of pandan (Yes, ONE LEAF) around a piece of chicken and deep fried till its so damn hard to bite on. Next, Garlic Scallops. They say its fresh. Fresh my two hairy balls! Its frozen scallop on scallop shells! Fresh scallop will still stick on to the shell ok. Think we stupid until don't know to differentiate between fresh and FAKE FRESH?? Last but no least, Steam Seabass, (They say its fresh) Again, fresh my foot! And the fire went out a minute after its served. We call and call and no one bother to light the fire for us. And best of all, the freaking place is so freaking hot! Cant even invest in cooling fans for your customers? And their price is Sky Rocket High!!!! This will be the last ever I will step in to any NO SIGNBOARD RESTAURANT. No business ethic at all!!! Beware if you are contemplating to patronize this restaurant. Think again. ITS JUST NOT WORTH IT
4
It's in an original hawker style setting but clean and cool which was great. Loads of staff on duty and not rude. First time we tried white pepper crab and we were disappointed. The quality of crab was great. Lots of meat even though it wasn't a massive crab. We also ordered frog legs which was tasty. The only negative being they gave us nuts ($3) at the start and wet towels ($0.5 each) which we found later were added to our bills, so remember to say no to them at start if you don't need.
4
This is a good place for a Good meal. Good sea food, crabs are its speciality.
The ambiance is OK but good quality food.
Definitely will recommend for eating.
4
well known, and yes pricey. but they are still seen to be packed because the food serve is good!! their crab is a must try
3
We ordered a white pepper crab and chilli crab at $80 a kilo. Both were delicious but quite expensive. We also ordere kangkong veges and fried bread to accompany them. The food overall was great but pricy. They also charge for every consumable that goes on your table such as penuts and wet cloth
4
We ate here on our first night in Singapore - as recommended by someone here, we had the white pepper crab. It was delicious, but at $80 expensive. It has scratched my crabs in Singapore itch.Beware the hand towel and peanut trick - just push them to one side and they will take them off your table.Service is fast and furious
5
Without a doubt one of the best meals I have ever had. I ordered the chili crab and a Tiger. The beer came in a bucket on ice and a "drink refresher" was constantly checking on me to make sure I always had a frosty glass.The meal is divine. The combination of savory chili and sweet crab is heaven. I can see why this was rated as one of the top 50 dishes in the world. This is a very casual restaurant with tons of Singaporean families enjoying themselves. If you want a loud, crowded, fun cultural experience go here. The service and food can't be beat
3
We had dinner with my wife's childhood friend at this restaurant. It was a nice evening out for dinner. We arrived at the restaurant early before the dinner rush. It was somewhat disappointing that they did not have the river crabs they were known for. We tried many dishes which included venison, large prawn, shark fin soup, sweet and sour pork, and crispy chicken. The prawn was good, venison was a first for me and my wife, the shark fin soup was fishy and not as good as other restaurants we've visited in the past. Price is rather expensive so expect to pay almost or even more then Manhattan pricing for certain item. Overall dinner was decent but I think I was more satisfied with my dinner at Lau Pa Sat and Chinatown.
2
For a place with no air conditioned and not in the city centre. At S$80/kg for crab is ridiculously expensive. Even the veg that is priced ex too.The cereal prawn dish as not even fresh! The food was not even hot. Their signature tofu is nothing to shout about. Their signature egg plant did taste okay but it doesn't look appetizing on first look.For 10 pax with 7 dishes, the serving recommended was too much. This definitely will be my last visit. Totally disappointed by their price and quality. It used to be good but not anymore
4
We heard about this restaurant from a cab driver! Simple advice, needn't go to ECP if we wanted real tasty seafood, sans ambience, and we heeded to it! Black/ white pepper chilly crabs are just too good, you won't stop eating...plus prawns and umpteen number of other seafood choices. This restaurant turned out to be just too good. One caution, it's not very cheap though and best way to get there is to get off at Ajuneid station on MRT Green Line, just a walking distance from there! Worth visiting
2
Everyone who visits Singapore wants to try chilli crab. There seem to be 2 alternatives..an outside hawker stall which is very casual outdoor eating with a large crab costing around 50-60 sing dollars or you can go to a more formal restaurant with indoor seating and pay a premium.We were shocked to find a Dungeness crab costing 128 sing dollars but the best was to come.When we got the bill they charged 3.20 sing for 4 small prepackaged hand towels and then 2.50 sing for a small bowl of peanuts which we didn't ask for .Reminds me of the bread basket trick on tables in Italy.The experience was ruined by blatantly ripping us off and I would suggest that people dress in light casual clothes and go to a hawker stall.There is one right around the corner from no signboard
5
Chilli crabs are famous in Singapore. The best one that I would recommend is the one in No Sign Board. I am a Singapore based overseas but when I return home every time, I would rush to savour my favourite dish. Of course, this restaurant also served other yummy food i.e. cereal prawn, sweet sour pork, creamy fried chicken, saucy Hor Fun. You will spoil for choices
5
As recommended by the tourist reading this is a must try in Singapore, after being there ourselves it even exceeded our already high expectation.
The crab is so big, fresh and tasty. Would definitely go again every time we visit Singapore.
5
Good seafood restoran with excellent view to the Marina Bay. Good crabs, shark fin soup, scallops and vines. Not cheap.
4
Very good seafood especially is chili crab. The price is reasonable and should book it in the weekend.
5
Authentic, Real, Delicious! Unique atmosphere. The best seafood you can find in Singapore. This is the first original restaurant and I love that they didn't change it. Want to experience local Singapore; Go!
4
This place is very genuine and located in a popular area of Singapore (Geylang) away from tourist flow.It is also recommended for large groups and you have the choice to eat outdoor in a quite large area.Most of the customers are local people with family. Service is attentive and friendly.Signature dish is the white pepper crab (really big). It is a must have.Other fish dishes and sea food is really fresh and excellent
4
Enjoyed the arrival and neighborhood. Good service and extensive menu, essentially it all boils down to the sea food offerings. Tried all variations of crab cooking. Excellent experience and reasonable price (in the Singapore context at least). Good for mid-size groups willing to share indoor or outdoor. Great evening with friends - will go back for sur
4
This is generally good and the food is generally tasty. No different this time, except the Chili Crab was a disappointment (the sauce was so-so) when compared to the White Pepper Crab which is their signature. Other things that are really good include the Cereal Prawns but the White Pepper Crab is a must have. I've had the Black Pepper Crab before and it was outstanding. We also ordered steamed rock cod and that was delicious!! It may not be as obvious as the crabs but the meat was super tender and I actually ended up liking that the most
4
The chili crab is a must try. It was juicy and flavorful, not too spicy. It's pricey, but worth it. As people have said, there are no napkins. They give a bowl of water with lemon for rinsing your fingers and there is a washing station in the back to wash your hands. If you're a sloppy eater like myself, I suggest bringing napkins or maybe a hand towel from your hotel. The wet napkins cost S$0.30.
5
You can found many seafood for tourists arround Clark Quay, here, the place is less beautiful and it's more a night place than a familly place ... but you can taste here the best seafood of Singapore ... espacialy the crab with eggs ... the best in Asia ..
4
First night in Singapore and was told to go the No Signboard... strange name. Down and local and good... could not be fresher if it tried, in the entrance to the open kitchens are banks of marine tanks brimming with lobster, crayfish, crabs and the odd fish too. The Kitchens busting with chefs and commies all hard at work steam everywhere... certainly not short of atmosphere. My beer arrived in an ice bucket and the crayfish in a chilli sauce soon followed. Perfectly cooked but I would not recommend the sauce, a bit too overpowering for the delicate flesh... just plain next time, and there will be a next time. The restaurant is basically outside under a corrugated roof brisling with electric fans, simple but clean and the service was very nice and friendly. All good, I highly recommend this fun tasty place... somewhere a bit different... and the area too. Reminds me a bit of Soho London in the 7O's but better... with a bit of Bombay thrown in..Singapour style of course..
4
Great chilli crabs! Not fancy or silver service but basic good food....get a taste of the real Singapore. Beware everything cost extra ie nuts, towels etc but won't break the bank.
5
This is a very famous restaurant and it is easy to understand why. Great service, wonderful food (they are even ready to cater for vegetarians) and nice location.
3
Overall awesome food. We had 2 types of crab, both delicious. The crayfish was insanely delicious. Good dessert. My issue was it took over 20 minutes to get the check at the end and that memory stands out more than the food.
4
If you are kind of person who can enjoy mismatch like eating $100+ pepper crab at car park, this is fun place to go... Decent food worth its fame, but the atmosphere is nothing like high-ended restaurant despite the cost. They are full every day so they set tables and chairs even at car park! Maybe this is tolerance of this country. If you can't enjoy it, better stay away from this place
5
"When in Singapore, be sure to have some crab." Certainly that's true, but I believe No Signboard Seafood is one of the better places to go to. They have a couple of spots, and my condo was close to the one in Geylang. Expect to pay quite a lot for this (150 SGD bill for 2 people) but the (chilli) crab is simple HEAVENLY. This is definitely my go-to address next time I'm in town. You shouldn't have to make a reservation because there a lot of space. Expect it to be crowded though
5
We went to the original restaurant, I hope I am reviewing the correct location now. Its an out of the way hole in the wall, quite large back and front. Loud, bright and gay (in the old sense). WE loved it. Service good enough food delicious. Chilli crab of course but also salt & pepper crab not to be missed. Its a sort of plastic table cloth place and not elaborate at all sort of warehouse space, but it al works. Wines & beers not great but also not expected. We would recommend for atmosphere and food
4
I searched for options for Chilli Crab and this restaurant repeatedly came out on top. Read the menu cover when you visit and you will learn that this started as a stand in a hawker centre. The woman who founded it couldn't afford a signboard. Now, it is a famous restaurant. But ... It still has an open air feeling that is reminiscent of a hawker center.The Chilli Crab was perfect. I followed recommendations from the staff and got a dish of rice to soak with the sauce, and that could be a meal in itself.This is on the edge of the famous Geylang area. Don't let this deter you. The restaurant is separate from the other goings-on. It is in a clean, safe area.As I indicated, the Chilli Crab was excellent. I had the rice, a beer, the little fried buns that the waiter recommended, and a steamed vegetable that in Vietnam is called morning glory. I neglected to write the name down. The beer was a large Tiger beer. A waitress brought an ice bucket to keep the beer chilled.Staff were friendly and helpful. The crowd started to build around 6:30 pm. Most of the patrons were families, large groups from offices (usually around 12-15 people), and a few individual tourists like me. Come before 7:30 pm if you can to avoid having to wait.Enjoy Singapore - Enjoy the Chilli Crab
3
The restaurant was packed when we went and the staff seemed frazzled. They were dismissive and bordering on rude. The white wine was placed on our table and the ice bucket appeared 15 minutes later. The waitress made it clear that she really didn't have the time to explain anything on the menu. The food was average
1
Yes, the food here is quite decent and you will enjoy your order, but it does not in any way compensate on the slow, everlasting service which must get better soon!. You can find delicious seafood and chili crab in so many other places in Singapore where customers are treated better
4
We had to have the usuals: cereal prawn, sambal kang kong, baby squid, and chili crabs. We were nearer the Esplanade branch of the restaurant but decided to eat at the Geylang branch for "authenticity". While it took our order a bit to arrive, it was worth the wait. The crab was fresh and meaty, and the flavours were well balanced. It turned out to be a bit pricier than I remember though
4
Delicious food. Service was ok but not amazing. Ordered mee goreng mixed vegetables and the chilli crab. $60 for crab under 1kg but was sooo good. Worth experiencing once so definitely check out and try
4
Black pepper crabs- delicious. Go before seven in the evening. Locals love this restaurant too. Thank you, chef.
4
Really good chili crab (one big crab cooked in a chili sauce, served family style) and other tasties (veggies, fried buns, assorted seafood) that's perfect for a group meal. A little pricey (~40-50 SGD per person), but worth the experience.
5
we come here whenever we visit singapore. highly recommend the delicious chili crab and abalone in the open-aired space.

why the title? arriving on the night of the 50yr celebrations for the Independence of Singapore we were looking for a quick Chinese food experience.. We were staying in Gaylang,v plane delayed due to the celebrations so were very hungry. We found this restaurant, busy with locals and so stopped. first we were given a plate of peanuts which we hopped into. then we received the menu to find out that the peanuts cost $3. Not a problem. No serviettes but given a sealed hand towels ( like on the aeroplane). then we felt ignored. We attracted the attention of an employee who called another staff member who was very helpful in advising us what not to eat!! the prices were similar to Sydney licensed restaurants though the decor was very basic, outdoors and the table was not clean. We were 4 adults and decided to order only 3 small dishes then we could have more if required. These were rice and noodles with prawns and veges, they were great value and 3 were enough. Beers were well priced for Singapore and cold.The surprise came with the bill when we were charged $1.20 for each hand towel! Yes it was a busy night, people were waiting for tables, obviously well liked by the locals. but felt the cost of the hand towels could have been better spent on food. Hint: Do not touch the peanuts if you do not want them, return them immediately and take your own serviettes
1
This is the first time I have tried the Salted Egg Crab and unfortunately it was cold on the inside when it was served. The meat stuck to its shell, a sign that it might not be very fresh.While the Chili Crab was reasonable, based on past experience, today's experience was totally unacceptable.
4
Great white pepper crab, but the signature chili crab was a disappointment this trip. However overall it is still one of the better places to have chili crabs in Singapore. Service was very good, but again depends who you get serving you, we had a very lively and over- enthusiastic waiter, so that sort of made the difference
1
Was really looking forward to trying No Signboard Seafood, which had been recommended by the hotel. It took a while to find it and we were disappointed to see that the tables had not been cleaned from lunch and that there was a fair amount of food on the floor. The service was indifferent and the prices high, so we left
1
After hearing/reading good reviews about the place, I was really looking forward to lunching at the restaurant, and so were the friends I came with. All in all, people really seemed to enjoy themselves, but for me it was somewhat different. we came at a comfortable hour, so the place had people, but wasn't too packed. It still took them over 10 minutes to clean the table we sat in and about 15 more minutes until we had a waitress coming to take our orders. we were sitting there for 30 minutes drinking our Tiger beers waiting for our food to arrive, only to have the manager coming to us and ask us to repeat our order (at that point our realised that the food is not coming for another half an hour, and we decided to get up and leave. Thanks for ruining my Friday!
5
It's my favorite crab restaurant whenever I crave for white pepper crab. This is the original first restaurant which is located in Geyland and it's open air seating. My favorite dishes here is the white pepper crab ( crab with crab roe), Yangzhou fried rice, steam bamboo clams and stir fried vegetables. The steam prawn is delicious too. They are open for dinner( not sure about lunch) till late night.
5
Fantastic food!! Ordered red chili crabs, white pepper crabs, fried baby squid, and other delicious items. I particularly loved the white pepper crabs...yummm!

The signature pepper and chilli crab is to a good Singapore standard. The bull frog used on the dish was small and bony. The salt egg king prawn is good. It is an outdoor. Restaurant with average service
3
We ordered the white pepper crab as recommended by few reviews we read. It was good, but not that good. I think I regret not to order chilli crab instead. It seems their chilli crab is better.
Will be back to find out.

Went day on a Mon night in early Jul and was taking aback by their services. I remembered visiting them last year in Nov and services were better. I made a group reservation previously and they gave me a vip room. This time i did a walk in with my other half and was surprise it is quite full house on a Mon night and waited more than 45mins for my food.I ordered a chilli crab and a veg with superior soup for 2 pax. I did emphasize that I wanted "a female crab with EGG". The staff advised that if there is no egg, they will change. The first crab came. It was fine though the eggs were not as much a expected, but was acceptable, so we decide to order the second crab so we could have more eggs. This time we ordered Black Pepper crab. Extremely disappointed I would say... The black pepper crab is the watery style, unlike Long Beach or Jumbo... and was extremely unhappy that there was completed NO EGGS in the shell.. there were bits and pieces of little eggs but NOTHING at all in the shell... We told the staffs, a guy tried checking and agreed initially there was no egg.. a female came by and tell us.. crabs are like that.. this is indeed a female crab, but with little egg. I told her this is not correct, we requested for eggs and highlighted specially that it cannot be missed.. we asked if that can be cancelled, they say no allowed and they say they will try change for me but told me that it would take almost an hour due to the crowd... we waited more then 1/2hour for the second crab.. so we declined the offer and ate the crab with disappointment. we felt that the food is slightly overpriced for the service rendered and food per say.. 3 items - 2 crabs and 1 veg cost us over $200 where 1kg is 71kg. Seems rather average for these few brands of seafood place but I do not believe my crabs is that "big" that cost so high. Think I will not come back this place unless is organized by someone else

No one should ever leave Singapore without trying this restaurant. The original (I believe) of the No signboard chain, this restaurant's chilly crab, white pepper crab is surely one of the must trys! We also had the cereal prawns, you don't need to up the dish by ordering Tiger Prawns or King Tiger Prawns. The ordinary prawns is surely enough to taste the yummy cereal paste!!We were also very grateful to the waitress, who showed the courtesy to ask if we needed the wet towels and the pre-meal snacks as they might incur extra charges

Staff there are nice and efficient, though price is liitle bit high when compare to less famous small seafood stalls. Crab costs S$70 per kg when I went there. Location is just straight from the MRT, though you need to cross 2 traffic lights, it's easy access
4
A long name in many Singaporeans, it serves super good and fresh seafood at affordable price. U can find really exotic seafood within this place and price is very transparent with no bill shock. Small touches like complimentary desserts really means something.Please try, do try and must tr

A group of friends ate here expecting a lovely meal and a special occasion but we were very disappointed. The staff were unhelpful and did not know their dishes. Four of us ordered crab, cooked in different ways. When one was brought to the table and we asked which one it was we were told, "crab". The waitress had to go away to find out whose it was. When one person was left waiting for a long time for her meal, our requests were met with blank looks and even offers of more napkins! Others who had prawns said they were mushy, over-cooked and watery. When we got the bill we were charged for napkins and peanuts that were on the table when we arrived. We refused to pay for them. Don't waste your money on this place

Visited No Signboard in May with my partner. I've been to the famous En Seng Crabs previously and heard this place was famous for it's white pepper crab. The local info i received was that the chilli crab wasn't the best here.Defying local knowledge i ordered the chilli crab and the white pepper crab. I'd have to say the latter was amazing and No Signboard definitely lived up to its reputation! The chilli crab was excellent but not the best I've ever had, id have to say the little milk buns that came with the crab were amazing though, so fluffy!Expect to pay about $70SGD per kilo which is about average compared with other developed countries. Be warned that the moist towlettes, peanuts, tissues etc ARE NOT FREE even though they load the table up with them as you sit down. Pretty dodgy effort when they charge good money for good food but definitely not a deal breaker. The toilets are very basic and you have to walk through the live seafood kitchen to get there. The beer was extremely cold which is another high point!Our total order was the white pepper crab, chilli crab, Chinese water spinach, fried eggplant 1 beer, 1 coke and it was around $150SGD. Overall it was well worth the adventure and i definitely recommend the white pepper crab

I was in Singapore for an exhibition late May early June. Up til then I hadn't had the chance to venture out until the factory went home. We had just finished the Aquarama 2015 Aquarium show. The first place I hit was the No Signboard Seafood restaurant on Geylang within walking distance of my hotel. I went early around 5:00 to avoid the crowd and very glad I did cuz just one hour later there was a line at the entrance. Got a table near the corner and the beer lady comes up and I order a Tiger beer (big bottle). I tell the waitress I want chili crab. Man what a dinner beer, crab, plenty of sauce for the bread and rice. If you have to have just one meal in Singapore this would be it
5
Fantastic place. very relaxed atmosphere. We had the chilli crab and buns and the black pepper bull frog. Both were awesome. Prices were on the slightly higher side but I assume it should be cheaper than same Clarke Quay
5
Very local, delicious, huge selection of food, a must visit for all seafood lovers. This place is somewhat away from major touristic routes and thus you get bit more authenticity.
Totally worth it. Lala and pepper crab were "oh my god" good.
5
The chili crab is superb especially the buns that comes with it (buns cost 2.50 SGD). I enjoyed every bit of food we ate in there. We ate Stirfry Beancurd, Baby Squid and Yang chow fried rice also and they are all good!
5
The best chilli crab in Singapore! Their salted egg yolk crab and white pepper crab (concocted there) are also really good. While other restaurants use fake chilli sauce, No Signboard has a flavorful broth for their chilli crab- perfect for dipping those mantous!
2
Chili crab and white pepper crab is a chef recommend menu. On the day that I visited, they didn't have many choice of crabs. The staff recommended me Alaska crab and cooked it in two styles. The Alaska crab was in a good size but I regretted that I ordered this dish since the crab was not juicy and sweet. I had a chilli crab at Jumbo restaurant before and I preferred the food there
3
We wanted to eat chilli crabs and this restaurant is listed in the top 5 so off we went to Geylang Street. We rode the MRT all the way to Aljunied and walked quite a bit under the hot sun, the restaurant was informal and empty because we came early for lunch. Ordered a chilli crab 1 kilo, toasted buns, a cup of steam rice and Hong Kong noodle. The crab was succulent but the chilli sauce lacks the intensity, Hong Kong noodle is just ok, we should have ordered pepper carb which they are famous for and chilli scallops. But there always a next time but that next time we go, it will the branch in Esplanade and by taxi.
5
To get to this franchise, you are best to go to Aljunied MRT station. From there it is only a short 15min walk away. This branch of the No Signboard chain is no frills, but clean and comfortable. This branch is not the fancy upper market restaurant like the East Coast one.We went during lunch time and was promptly seated inside with air con. Service was quick and efficient, the waiter told us how much to order and was honest so that we didnâ€™t overdo it. Price wise it seemed a little cheaper than the East Coast branch and more on offer from the menu.Loved this chain of the No Signboard and I will be heading back
5
Really informal and relaxed, not at all posh very down to earth, but the food speaks for itself - delicious , crab was wonderful, and the chilli scallops exceptional. Incredible how they coul make brocolli taste so good too. I also had some little buns that were warm and so very very scrummy. Well worth the visit
3
We went to this venue as we googled best chili crab in Singapore and this was one of the top 5. An unassuming venue but we enjoyed the pepper crab, the chili crab was sweet and the sauce was pleasant but lacked depth. Steamed vegetables were fine and service was ok. The women seemed happier employees than the male worker and were more personable. Being charged for the peanuts and towels was not expected and let them down (perhaps we should have read reviews). The rude bloke at the next table had his phone on speaker and spoke at high decibels constantly - annoying!It appears we were overcharged for the crab - ask for the price per kilo prior to ordering. We asked for a medium size each but were charged a kilo each. Thanks taxi driver but it pays to do research first
4
I enjoyed the Chilli Crab and two cold Tiger Beers.My advice is to simply accept that this will be a messy meal. I used my fingers to get as much of the crab from the shell, claws and legs that I could.the meal came to S$8
5
Famous institution for crab lives up to the reputation. Great service especially from the beer lady who keeps you Tiger cold! The chilli crab sauce is amazing and the black pepper version was arguably even better. Great vibe & mainly locals.
4
The restaurant has excellent views of the bay and prompt attentive staff. I had the Chilli Crab which was very tasty, in particular the claws. The sauce was quite mild but very flavoursome. I would recommend, especially when combined with the views.
4
Interesting and busy dining institution in Singapore's Geyling area. Big range of seafood dishes. Good service but not cheap. Seems like a popular place for the locals. The general area is a little out of town and is not as interesting a locale as I'd expected. Supposed to be a red light area but I just saw Buddhist temples
4
We had a 25 minute wait for a table on a very crowded Saturday night, but it was worth every minute.The setup is open air and like a traditional Singaporean food stall, albeit on a huge scale. I counted at least 30 tables and stopped. There was a VIP section.The Chinese waitress was enthusiastic and spoke some English although very quickly. She efficiently wrote our order in Chinese.We received some peanuts that she said cost S$3 but for which we were not charged.Annoyingly, the excellent seafood rice arrived ahead of the pork spare ribs that were also tasty and not spicy. We were told that the food would not arrive for 45 minutes but the rice took 25 and the pork 35.The bill including two soft drinks came to S$37.90 which was reasonable given that the rice was a large quality and clearly of excellent, tasty quality.All around us groups were drinking buckets of Tiger beer served by the stubbie (small bottle) or consuming crab or prawns. Many of their bills would have been 10 times ours, but we did not feel cheated.The restaurant has multiple buses stopping nearby but my preferred way to reach it is by SMRT train to Aljunied metro station
4
Good place to try the pepper crab. The service is so so but the food is good. We tried the pepper crab which have 1.8kg heavy. We don't have those mud crab that heavy in Hong Kong. The price is acceptable but not cheapest we eat in Singapore. The environment is like traditional Singaporean food stall
4
We came here to try the Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab and a few other of Singapore's signature seafood dishes. The food was excellent - the above mentioned crabs, black pepper bullfrog, garlic shrimp, and fried rice were all great. We were with a group of people, and this was a good place for a group. The service could have been better - we were told up front it would be an hour for our food, which seemed a bit long, but at least they were upfront about it. The waitstaff seemed overwhelmed, as we had to flag down waiters to get menus, then to order, then for additional drinks. The drink waitress in particular wouldn't listen to our full order, but wanted to tell us how many beers to order and how to split them, which was a bit amusing, but got frustrating when she wouldn't bring as many as we asked for, then wasn't around for us to order more. It's an authentic experience though, with more of a local feel than some of the places downtown. It's a bit expensive, but then still a better deal than some of the more touristed downtown places

Organised a family chinese new year celebration. Night was going well until a man started harassing the kids table. Next thing we know he has run off with one of the kids ipads. Theft happens and its a rough part of town, the really disappointing part was the complete lack of care factor from the restaurant. You would be forgiven for thinking that they sanctioned the theft given the person who stole the ipad was pretending to be a waiter for almost an hour. They could not have been more obstructive, refusing to show CCTV and ignoring a number of requests for assistance. Police were great but the bottom line is the food was good but that counts for nothing if your night is ruined by a theft. Theft that could have been completely avoided if the staff kept an eye on those people pretending to be waiters who obviously were not !

We had visited to No Signboard Seafood once before, and enjoyed the food and decided to return with family for dinner on New Years Eve... Big mistake. Many of the prices on the menu had been changed (new labels tapes over) which sent the lower priced Chilli Crab to over 3 times its normal price. Of course this kind of thing is expected on one of the busiest nights of the year, but paying almost $200/kg for crab that is normally $60/kg is just ridiculous. On top of this they charge you for literally everything.. the Peanuts (already on the table when arriving), napkins and even tap water.The service was some of the worst I've experienced. We ordered a few dishes to share amongst our group, and decided to order more later if needed, to which we were told "no, you can only order once". There was set seating times, but 2 hours is ample time to order additional dishes. The food is always overpriced versus other alternatives in the city but we enjoyed No Signboard the first time and it's a shame it wasn't the same experience this time. All we can say is avoid this restaurant during any holiday period

I have been waiting for a long time for the Singapore Chilli Crab! It's amazing! It's quite pricy but it's really worth it. They cooked the crab with a stew so you're not only eating the big chunk of the crab but also eating the crab meat in the sauce. It came with some steam buns and they are so yummy
3
The restaurant is nice and the staff attentive. Give great advices from the menu. I took chili and pepper lobster. Since I'm not so used to open the shelfs I was happy the staff provided some help. The food was very good and I really enjoyed it. Finally the price tag comes very heavy. Not sure if it was worth the price I paid. But it was worth a visit
4
The atmosphere in the original branch is excellent.
The service is also very good.
As for the food, it was good but not fantastic (Jumbo has better flavoured chilli crab).
5
Go here if you want to escape tourist places. Excellent service and food! Love this place. Chillicrab FTW! :)

There many No Signboard in Singapore and this one is the most delicious. It is situated near MRT Aljunard and there are many old buildings nearby. The shop is very big and like hawker centre. You can choose to sit outdoor or inside air-conditioned room. Different styles of crabs, apart from chilli and pepper taste, you can choose. I like the crispy cereal prawn most as you can not find this dish at other places in the world
5
My student, a native of Subgapore took me to this restaurant as my request was an authentic place where the locals are dining. This place was live, quick service and excellent selection of squid and sea food and shrimps and I cannot recall all the great tasty food
4
We went to No signboard for its signature chili crabs but came home in love with their champagne chicken or what we call lemon chicken at home. by far the best sauce i have ever tasted. and their honey ribs, wow. We wer a group of seven. we had one chili crab (at 60 SGD per kilo), one yang chow friend rice (this was first to go, it was so tasty), one birthday noodles (this was also very good but we had to pack some leftovers), one champagne chicken, one honey ribs, one order of kaylan and softdrinks. The bill was about 215 SGD. not bad really
4
Though it does not have the great ambience of the beach as the other seafood restaurants in East Coast Parkway. The food serve were adequately good and if not better than even their rival competitor, Jumbo Restaurant.The White Pepper Crab may not have that fragrant smell of white pepper (perhaps it could have cool down quickly) but it still tasted great.The Chilli crab was ordinary but the other food was at least a 7/10 e.g. Fried Baby Squid, Vegetables and seafood fried rice.It is expected to be expensive but i would recommend this restaurant to others who want adequately good food. Most importantly, tourists do not need to be afraid of being overcharged

Given a tip on this place by a couple of locals while working here, so pal and I gave it a go at 11.30pm after we finished work.As cabs were non-forthcoming (they're a law unto themselves at night here in Singapore), we MRT'd it to Aljunied on the Green Line, and walked for about 5 minutes to find it in the middle of what is apparently the 'Red Light' District. (you'd hardly know it..)Firstly, a delight not to be turned away because 'kitchen closed' - first tick. (they're open till around 1am - and the surrounding eateries appeared to be also still up and running)A warm welcome awaited us at this enjoyably rough and ready gaff - complete with fluorescent lighting and no frills vibe. Wonderful not to be rushed.Seating is outside under the usual canopy - and there are smoking tables too for those so inclined - none of that Singapore bossiness here.After 2 attempts at chilli crab here in Singapore - which totally disappointed (tomato ketchup goo smothering the delicate flavour of crab) and one hawkers market attempt at 'black pepper crab' - nothing to write home about IMO - I was about to give up on crab in Singapore.We decided to plump for the 'speciality' - viz white pepper crab - I was intrigued, (and assured it didn't come overlaid with 'sauce')It was wonderful - spring onions are involved, and white peppercorns to be sure, and mouth smackingly gorgeous, and you could TASTE the crab underneath the complementary flavouring.All that, plus 'butter fried' squid (deliciously buttery) plus some greens and beer of course.I'd definitely go for the same again.Apart from the bizarre ubiquitous Singapore custom in these places, of charging for the 'snack sized saucer' of peanuts, the 'wet wipe' and 'napkins' (something that should be complimentary surely considering the messiness of what one is attacking..?) the service was charming and speedy (reading other reviews, maybe it's because there weren't many there at that time of night) and again, unlike other Singapore emporia I've frequented, they're not demanding you pay up front before you've even finished the meal.We got a tour of 'backstage' in the kitchens when we expressed interest in the fish tanks full of extraordinary sea creatures, and we happily chilled and finished our beer, while the staff sat around at neighbouring tables bent over a laborious fiddly task at the end of the night.What was this?On closer inspection, we noted they were separating white and black peppercorns from vast sackfulls, BY HAND, into the requisite receptacles, chatting and laughing. Go figure!(One guy had drawn the short straw and was peeling 1000 individual cloves of garlic by handâ€¦)We're going back next week before we depart, and bringing some more friends.Crab is never 'cheap' here, but this was reasonable (about 30-35S$ per crab - dependent on weight) but one crab is fine for one person,and if it's good, I'm prepared to pay.The rest of the meal+beer was cheaper than I've experienced elsewhere here, and very good.Definitely recommended

Chilli crab and pepper crab were very ordinary, the chilli sauce had very little taste and the pepper was so strong it completely overpowered the taste of the crab. Also had a pork and a vegetable dish that were very average. Took exception to the restaurant putting down a plate of peanuts without having been ordered and then having the audacity to charge us for it. Also charged us for the serviettes we used !!! though only 30 cents it is the principle I object to. Better crab to be had in Singapore. See review on Eng Seng
3
Went there with my husband, food was good. We had spicey crabs and those small homemade bread which was sweet btw and didnt fit in perfectly with crabs but overall its good. Only thing is that price is total rip off..we paid dinner for 2 with 2 local beers around 100 sgd
5
This place is amazing, we were with friends so they ordered. We had Sri Lankan mud crab, crayfish, snapper, prawns with noodles and rice. The service was very attentive. Glasses are cooled, drinks are poured a little at a time and each time a new, cool glass is offered. The ladies who serve the beer are not part of regular staff, they are franchised hence the attentive service! The beers are served from a bucket of ice at table on a trolley, these are then added up for the bill. Each table is given a canvas bin to put handbags, cameras etc to prevent theft. An unusual but fabulous experience.
5
My family and I enjoyed all the seafood dishes and will revisit to this restaurant. The crabs are very tasty and fresh. Even the fried noodles are very well too.
5
Came here with a local Singaporean as a group of 4. This was a great eating experience.Fried baby squid, frog leg soup, 2 kinds crab, kailan greens, prawns. This was by far one of my best seafood spots in Singapore. There are so many options to choose. Order multiple and share among the table.Absolutely top-notch service. I can't recommend this place enough. A bit off the path from the typical tourist locations. And it's a more local decor and laid-back setting. You can even go to the holding tanks and select your own fish/crab/lobster/abalone/etc if you know how to select.Well worth a cab ride here for great food, service and local ambience
4
We had white pepper crab and salted egg crayfish. As we all Cantonese, we loved the salted egg source!! It's new to our taste buds but so familia, highly recommended if you want to try something different. We went on Monday for lunch, so it was not busy at all. The waiters were really polite and explained in details where the seafood were from and what's the best way to cook to bring out the flavor. Really professional. We had a great time and the price is good as at this original No Signboard restaurant, they don't charge service fees and taxes
3
We went to try the white pepper crab which they are known for and apparently the only place in Singapore do this?! The white pepper crab was very good but I did have crab envy seeing the chilli crab with all it's yummy sauce and little bread rolls go by! The salted egg prawns were not to my taste hence my average score, however of you go and have the chilli crab I am sure you will love it as everyone round us seemed to be enjoying it an awful lot!
5
We came for dinner and enjoyed every second of it we had the famous white pepper crab and the butter fried chickenThe food is great and is a real authentic restaurant and don't expect any fancy frills as you might need to sit and enjoy your meal in the car park Highly recommen

No sign board has a great name in the chili crab / black pepper crab in Singapore. That's the right place for traditional seafood in Singapore, and their geylang outlet is probably one of the more genuine.Yet, Sad to say, even though you still can eat well there, I think they are victim of their own success and that the value for money is decreasing. Good for "beginners" in the art of chili crab eating and for tourists.Not so great anymore for experienced crabbers ^_
3
This is their first original restaurant. Compare to the new branches in esplanade and vivo, the interior is very humble.You can feel as though you eat at the old singapore hawker restaurant. They have the semi outdoor and indoor restaurant ( with air con ).As usual, the foods are nice, the only downside is the service. I don't know why they were very slow to cook the food. Again, i'm suspicious it's because of lack of manpower. Same like their other branch.Our chili and salted egg crab came out around thirty minutes after we reminded the staff. Some of the staff can't speak english, so body language ( just pin point to the pictures in the menu) is just fine.You can use their valet service for free if you drive
1
Visited the original branch in Geylang. Made reservations from hotel at 830pm on Tuesday night. Upon arrival at 830pm, the maître d' didn't care a bit we had a reservation. He was scrambling to find us (a party of 3) a table. Was going to put us next to the driveway of the restaurant where the in-house valet parks cars and I refused that table. Shortly thereafter, a car came out of the driveway that obviously belonged to one of the departing parties. Why should I or anyone have to eat with auto fumes in our faces. This place no longer cares about the customers' experience because they are obviously too busy counting money. The maître d' couldn't have cared less that we left as he had plenty of people behind us to fill our places. It's only a matter of time that this sort of arrogance leads to a downfall as people like ourselves will never even taste their supposedly good food..
4
Personally feel that it's a little too pricey. Be ready to spend at least sgd80 per person as the dishes are not cheap.However, food was good but can be better. Service was okay, toilets were acceptable. Mainly flocked by tourists (explains why it's pricey). Locals will tell you there're other places which serves better chilli crab at a lower price
5
This is bound to be debatable but I believe the Geylang No Signboard chilli crabs is still the best chilli crabs I've had in Singapore and indeed anywhere else. The first time I tried this was in 2011 and have gone back in August 2013 while on a business trip. We were worried whether it was still as good as we remembered but geylang did not disappoint. The crabs were meaty and the sauce authentically flavoursome and definitely spicy, but it was so tasty that you couldn't get enough of it especially with the mini sweet buns. Black pepper crabs are also good here and you can't go wrong a plate of kang kung on the side, all washed down with lime juice. Have tried many other places including jumbo and other No SIgnboards but Geylang No Signboard beats them all hands down. Will definitely be going back for more
4
We went to the Esplanade outlet, just for the record. The food is good. The price is bit steep at S$200+ for a peppered crab, a steamed fish, a veggy dish and fried rice. The services are par for an average chinese restaurant.
4
Good flavours, plentiful food
Not sure about the bullfrogs in the tanks
Service average
Noisy when crowded
4
They do the best chili crab in town. Try the flavor of the egg-based sauce with the fried mantou it's awesome. I have been to 3 No signboard - one on riverside, one at Clarky Guay and another one like a big street vendor restaurant. All good
4
We chose this restaurant at geylang to taste the famous chilli crab as recommended as the 'local' experience, rather than the 'international.' Our taxi driver explained there were 2 restaurants in singapore. The local restaurant would be more spicy whereas the international would adjust for the weak tourists! Both myself and my husband love out food hot so the choice was clear and we were not disappointed!!We were greeted and seated straight away. I think you could walk in but i would suggest booking. We were fortunate our taxi driver booked us a table.The restaurant was very atmospheric and bigger than i imagined. Great selection of food from crab to vegetarian options. They automatically brought appetisers of peanuts and after we begjn eating told us they were $3! We didnt mind too much but just an FYI! Service throughout was excellent. They did like to encourage the beer though once you had one! Great attention to detail though with the beer, including an ice bucket, waitress top up and even a fresh cold glass when they noticed it had lost its cool frosting!Although i have nothing to compare it to, the chilli crab was a nice dish. It had a real kick which i love! We also ordered bread to soak up the sauce, which seemed endless! We finished with a lime/orange sorbet dessert which was perfect!Id love to go back and try more of their food now ive done the crab.A lovely, authentic meal in Singapore. They even got us a cab straight away so cant comment on what ive heard is a 'colourful' part of town

We wanted to try this out after hearing so much about it. We showed about around 7:30pm and did not have to wait for a table, though I think we got one of the last ones available. The service was initially good, drink orders taken fast, then a bit pressured to order food. We ordered salted egg crab, pepper prawns, mixed vegetables, and champagne chicken (for young son). The crab was good, but not the best I have had in Singapore. The prawns were not so good, very very small. The chicken was good and vegetables were good too. However, the service was pretty lousy. After the drinks and initial order, noone came around at all. Son needed some more water, but no one would come over, even with us flagging them down. I had to stand in front of the kitchen and block their paths to get service, had to do this twice actually. Overall, we had to give it a try, but would not try again. Better places, even Newton Hawker center, for good crab without the hassle and over-inflated pricing
3
We waited an hour for a table, fair enough, but the service was poor, rice came, then one meal 20 min later, then after 3 requests next meal, about 30 minutes later. Food was delicious, we had the chili crab, pepper crab, small fried rice, bottle of water, one tiger beer. The 2 crab were $65 ea. the bill totalled $200, they charged for the paper napkins and wet wipes. The next day a taxi driver asked if we had been overcharged when we commented we had been there. Apparently they are known for overcharging
4
For S$168, we got 1 order yang chow fried rice, 1 chili crab (Iforgot how much a gram would cost), 1 order cereal prawn, 1 deep fried medium fish, 1 order sweet and sour frog and 2 coke in cans plus 2 wet tissues and peanuts. Service was good, the waitress was smiling the whole time. Yes the peanuts, I thought at first they were free of charge but the server told us it would be charged to us. We weren't going to even touch it, but since we were hungry already and the food was taking too long to be served, we ended up ordering another small bowl. But after, the food tasted fresh and so right to our tastes. In fact, writing this review, I drooled at just the thought of the chili crab
3
Heard that No Signboard is very famous on exellent food but it turns out that is not so great. It's not worth to make a special trip to go there. We were there at around 1:00pm. Just a few tables ocuppied. If you paid that kind of money, you can get a better & comfortable place to eat & relax. As they didn't put the 10% service charge on your bill, they charge on additional small stuffs like wet paper towels, small dishes which they put down on your table
4
The restaurant was recommended by the concierge of our hotel.We got to the place at around 4pm so there was hardly any other customers and possibly that's the reason why the place was quite clean. The waiter spoke broken English but managed to explain to us the specials and recommend us ordering the items we wanted in a 4pp Set Menu to save. Amongst 5 girls, we ordered two crabs - the Singaporean Chilli Crab and the White Pepper Crab, Oatmeal Prawns, steamed snapper and Garlic Fried Vegetables. The Singaporean Chilli Crab also has complimentary "Man-Tou" aka fried buns and soft, white bread. The food was excellent. The mud crabs were very meaty. The Oatmeal prawns were delicious and the snapper was very fresh. The set menu also included a selection of desserts to choose from. We ordered the Durian Cendol (shaved ice with coconut milk), The tofu pudding, and herbal jelly. The price we paid was quite reasonable. Only downside is that the restaurant charges for packets of tissue and the small plates of pickles they pop onto the table. I started munching on them before the waiter told me it was an additional cost

Reservasi tempat adalah wajib hukumnya karena tempat ini selalu penuh! Mereka telah menyajikan aneka macam hidangan seafood lokal sejak tahun 1980an dan sangat digemari oleh penduduk lokal dan wisatawan. Sampai sekarang mereka telah memiliki 3 cabang di Singapore, 1 di Macau and 1 di...INDONESIA!Teman saya telah melakukan reservasi di hari sebelumnya, tapi pada saat kami tiba, ternyata reservasi kami telah diambil orang lain yang mengaku sebagai teman saya! Untungnya masih ada satu meja yang kosong...so, kami tidak jadi komplen. Tentu kami pesan Chilly Crab karena ini adalah signature dish lokal Singapore yang wajib dicoba di No Signboard...maknyus tenan, apalagi dimakan dengan fried bun nya atau nasi goreng ikan asinnya.

Yummy place to get seafood especially their signature chili crab dish. Price was expected and the server were very helpful and we left with a happy tummy..

We went here quite late (11pm). The place was very dirty - they must have had a big night. Food and rubbish on the floor. Tables not clean. We ordered chilli crab, some vegetable dishes (kailang and brocoli) and beer. After 20 minutes we still had not got our beer and other people were receiving their drinks soon after ordering. Of course they had forgotten about us! At least when it eventually did arrive it was nice and cold! Atmosphere was quite horrible. However I must say the food was excellent! Took a while to come but that's a good thing as the crabs are prepared fresh. Vege dishes were fantastic. Would only come here for the food. take away would be the preferred option. Not happy having to pay for wet tissues either. When ordering $70 crab dish, the least they could do is provide some tissues or wet tissues. Chilli crab is a messy dish after all! Toilets were disgusting. Not quite what we expected from what we had heard was one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore. Obviously the reputation is based on the taste of the food alone, but there is much more to a good dining experience than the taste..
2
The food there are not as good as it taste outside. The vegetables have no taste and all is tasteless. I did not try the crabs as my friends say it is not worth a try. The prawns are too salty and may not suit us. The atmosphere is dirty, tissues are around when i went there! There were smoke and all and i do not like it! It is not worth to go please go and spend your money at a place where it is more worth it like G7 sinma oka

If you like a no frills type place with focus on great food then this place will not disappoint. The white pepper crab we had was delicious! So was the veggies and the calamari we had. We're going back to try the Chilli Crab next time.
4
Some friends have recommended this place saying that their price is slightly cheaper compared to branches located at more prime locations. This branch in Geylang is by the busy road side.Service is fast. Food is still good. Don't forget to order the deep-fried mantou buns to finish the chilli crab gravy
5
In town for work and decided to treat my colleagues with delicious Singaporean seafood fare and where else to take them to but No Signboard Seafood?! So I did, and boy am I glad I did. We went for the $498 set meal and it was a royal feast: noodles, black pepper crab, chilli crab, steamed whole red snapper, prawn and scallop, lots of tofu/vegetables which we got in turn of the crocodile meat/chicken combo. Also ordered the yam ring with vegetables mix seeing as it's one of my favourite things. We had about ten big bottles of Tiger with the meal. Total cost with (optional) tips: $700 for ten very happy diners. :
2
Unlike some previous posters we had good service and the menu was explained to us. However, I am giving this restaurant a low score mostly because of the ridiculous over pricing. The crab was delicious but very expensive. The lobster was $75 for half and it was average. Dinner for 3 was $200 and we were not full. No rice and it was $8 for a small (really small!) bowl of Chinese spinach
5
wanted a good chilli crab and was aiming as usual for the Long Beach but taxi driver indicated this one and I am glad he did.The place is typical of Singapore and the Chili crab was really tasty. We also had drunken prawn soup which were tasty, the waiter even did a show to my friend who was startled by the live prawns :).The service was prompt and without any fuss.Do no go there if you expect posh environment and service. This is street style
1
Diabolical sevice! The servers did not understand English and as a result we ended up with two noodle dishes instead of one noodle and one rice. The seafood was average! But worst of all was when we asked for napkins and were offered a bib each instead!!

Our family went for dinner at the famous No Signboard Seafood Restaurant at Geylang Road.We had their signature dish, White Pepper Crabs, which was very good. Simple peppery taste mixed with the softness of the crab meat was a delight.We also had 'lala (small mussels) with dried shrimps and shallots.' This dish was also very tasty and fully of surprising flavors.The deep fried soon hock (a type of fish) in light soy sauce was also very good. Overall, the seafood are fresh and a gourmet's delights.As this is a busy restaurant, do make reservations as well as be prepared to wait for 30-45 mins for your dishes after you have ordered
1
I rarely write negative reviews, but I'd hate for others to waste their time and money on this place. The service was beyond rude. They pretty much ignored us for most of the meal. I actually had to chase people down to get more water and to order. Even then it took 15 or more minutes to get them to come over. We eat out in fine restaurants often, so I'm not stingy. This food was good, but absolutely not worth the price. Nothing special! This restaurant was recommended by our hotel. We told the hotel manager about our experience and he checked it out himself. They no longer recommend it, as he agreed with me. So much so, he apologized profusely and gave us a free bottle of wine and sweets as an apology
1
After reading the reviews here and seeing how close this is to our resturant, we gave it a chance. We left before ordering. It was $60/kg minimum for any crab. The cheapest thing on the menu was a fried Bull frog at S$10/each but you must order 2 of them. If you wanted overly priced street food in the red light district, go here. We walked down the street and paid S$27 for a crab that was very delicious.

Rather than the touristy Clarke Quay seafood spots, we wanted to check out something that is (probably still touristy but) a little less refined. Geylang is Singapore's red light district, and though it seemed completely fine and safe, it's a dirtier and older area than many of the well-known Singapore highlights. So we figured we'd check out No Signboard since we had a friend visiting. The service wasn't great - it was fine and they took care of everything we asked for - but this is not fine dining by anyone's standards and you should not expect it. It's more hawker-style dining at touristy prices, though still not awful compared to many of our other Singapore experiences. We had called in a reservation, but they seemed confused and did not have it when we got there - but we got a table anyway. We ordered a white pepper crab, a chili crab, seafood hor fun, and stir fried vegetables. All were good - not spectacular but in line with expectations and enjoyable for our visiting friend. Along with a few beers (very cheap by SG standards) the bill came to something like SGD $130 for three of us, I'm guessing is probably a little less than you'd pay for the same thing at Jumbo. The location itself is half in a parking garage (at least on a Friday night) which was pretty interesting. So if you're looking for Singapore style crab and want to venture a little off the path, or have already done some of the other big name places, I think this one is worth trying out if you're going in with the right expectations
4
I had been wanting to check out this place for some time, they are the pioneers of black pepper crab so it was indeed on order and it didn't disappoint. Took a friend there to show off Singapore crab and they were more than happy with the experience overall. Some of the side dishes we had were a little average, specifically the fried baby squid which is normally my favorite, on this occasion it tasted a little old
4
Awesome crab, eaten outdoors for an authentic dining experience in colourful Geylang.Food was great. Service is a bit odd as they bring things out as soon as they are ready. I was told this was normal... But did have to wait a while for the rice ....Still the fish and crab were fantastic
5
Ate here for the second time this year- quality of the food was excellent and we enjoyed every bite. I like both the Chili Crab and the Black Pepper Crab, but like the Black Pepper just a bit better. Service was excellent and we enjoyed people watching in this colorful neighborhood
4
One of the reasons why I wanted to visit Singapore is to try their authentic Singapore Chili Crabs..and my choice to have it at No Sign Board was no mistake. Me and my family enjoyed our dinner at their Vivo City branch. The thick chili sauce was awesome, can't resist to order my second cup of rice,haha! Crabs we're fatty and finger lickin' good! Definitely I'll dine here again when I get the chance to visit again Singapore
2
Very over priced. We ordered chili crab and ended paying Sing $900 for 6! The food was not that great. The service was mediocre. No smiley servers... Very busy and under staffed. If you are interested in a packed place without the good food and service, then this is the place. An alternative is the Newton Market, a short MRT ride with a great seafood and an authentic atmosphere
3
If you want to have some wonderful local seafood dishes, I would suggest going to a hawker market. We all found this was a place tourists go, and the prices reflected it. Also, when asking the staff questions about the dishes, they struggled to answer because of language issues. Everywhere in Singapore, English is spoken so didn't get the difficulty. We lived locally for 3 months, but only ate here once
4
I have been many times to various branches all over Singapore, The food is good, there is no doubting that but the prices have shot up, it use to be a really great deal for crab and seafood but since they have become so popular I have found their prices have rocketed up.It is still a nice experience to go there, it harks back to old style street food, just not the prices to match.I would probably go just once if in Singapore but there are cheaper and better versions of the famous crab dishes elsewhere
3
Three of us, ordered chili crab, fried meehoon and a vege. The source of the chili crab was superb but the crab was not fresh. The fried meehoon and vege was quite ok. Good service. But the food is overprice.
4
i love the local feel of this branch of the famous restaurant. with the local eating and spitting, the experience is so real. the seafood was really good as well, esp the crabs. other things weren't bad either. i like the experience, and it's definitely cheaper than its other relatives in posher surroundings

This restaurant was recommended to us by a taxi driver who rated it as the best place to try Singaporean chilli crab. We later found out that a restaurant called Jumbo is better but we'll have to try that next time. The restaurant is large and in a more run-down part of town. I actually enjoyed seeing a different side to Singapore, having only ever experienced the wealthier parts of Orchard Road and Sentosa. The meal starts with small bowls of salted peanuts and the most delicious chilli sambal dipping sauce I've ever had! I need to learn how to make that...We started with black pepper crab and then followed it with the famous chilli crab and kang kung (water spinach?). The black pepper crab was sublime! We had eaten a lot of it in Phuket last year and No Signboard's version did not let us down. We were licking our fingers clean. The chilli crab came next, in a big thick soupy sauce. To be honest, we found this a bit of a let down after the black pepper crab and if this is an authentic version of the dish, I am not sure that I'd be in a hurry to eat it again. We drank fresh coconut water which was a perfect accompaniment to all the spicy food. The taxi driver suggested that we might not want to take the kids to the restaurant because it was in the "red light district". Well, this has got to be the tamest red light district in the world!! If your children have walked around places like Soho, London, you have nothing to worry about. There were plenty of families eating at the restaurant and I would have no hesitation in recommending the restaurant to families
4
My wife and I visited this place while vacationing in Singapore…it was good. You can’t visit Singapore and NOT try the Chili Crab. We decided to try it at No Signboard (it was near our hotel). We have not tried Chili Crab before and have no reference to compare it to other places. That being said, it was delicious. I will say that we were “offered” hot tea when we arrived and wet naps for the meal (it's quite messy) and later discovered that we were charged for both. This just may be a Singapore thing vice this particular restaurant
4
Great authentic place, out of the touristy districts of Singapore. A girl friend of a buddy of mine living in Singapore recommended it, i must say its unpretendtious good food. Restaurant is by the street, it gets loud but real. It is in the neighborhood of the ' poorer areas' of singapore. The chilli crab was great, prices very reasonable. A must visi
4
Good crab place. They have a few locations throughout Singapore. This one is a street side but its large. Plenty of seatinh area in a covered outdoors street side & what they call the VIP room which is a normal in shop dining hall. Food is good. Service is average with many of the waiters with poor english. However the place is setup in a friendly atmosphere with a few supervisors overseeing the operation. It's pricy so dont expect street side prices
5
Visited at 13:30 on a Friday, we were able to sit in the VIP area( air-con room). The staffs were quite friendly, told them we were two girls want to order a smallest crab, so they picked the smallest one for us, its still big though... lolOrdered a small chili crab( $60/KG) , small cereal prawn($20), Chinese tea iced*2 and mantou *2 (qt 4 each)This was the second time I had all those food, in a different place. The Chili crab was nice, a bit spicy and sweet, sour, dip with freshly fried mantou... I loved the sauce and the mantou, soooo yum!!! Of course the crab was good in taste, but I just couldn't forget the mantou with sauce~~~The cereal prawn was nice, you can eat the whole prawn, crispy and sweet. Quite an amazing combination which I had never tried in other asian country, like Taiwan.All in all, this was a pleasant visit, and I will come back with more friends!!Also,I have to recommend the cashier, the aunty was really friendly and explained to me all the detail. As when I paid the bill in SG, they seldom check and tell you what's the item

“S$55 a kilo for chilli crab?! I thought this was hawker food? What the?”Before the 1970s, before Singapore separated from Malaysia, street hawkers were cooking chili crab on the streets.You can still find chilli crab in some Chinese zi char stalls located in coffee shops and hawker centres (where a wide variety of a la carte dishes are usually served with white steamed rice and soups), but these are few and far between.Chilli crab is now generally a meal reserved for restaurants, sold at jacked-up prices, and No Signboard Seafood Restaurant in Geylang, which originated as a hawker stall without a name or sign, is the epitome of this metamorphosis.As it has been consistently voted as one of the top 5 chilli crab restaurants in Singapore, I had to try it, despite my first impressions of the place: a large, noisy, outdoor eating space with valet parking and a VIP area; and staff, equipped with communication headsets, marching between the tables, waiting for executory commands from their maire d’, like a military drill waiting for commands from its commanding officer. Taking a seat, I had to steel myself not to let my taste buds be influenced by the garish surroundings, pushy (albeit efficient) service, hard sell tactics and additional costs for what felt like everything other than the privilege of actually sitting down to eat.“30c for a serviette - really? Andy why have they brought me snacks that I haven’t ordered and are now telling me that I will have to pay S$3.00 if I eat them? And are they really expecting me to drink more if they bring out my drinks quickly and pour them even more quickly? And why are they bringing me the dessert menu while my fingers are covered in chilli sauce and I am chomping on a crab claw? Think of the crab, think of the crab… because this should be more about the crab than the restaurant or the service.”So back to the crab…Pushing all of the above aside, I can safely say that it was the best chilli crab that I have eaten at a restaurant so far: a fleshy, succulent crab, in a thick, spicy, sweet, crab bisque style sauce, with no overwhelming taste of tomato. Finger licking good – though at S$55 a kilo, it ought to be! A far cry from hawker food, that’s for sure!!For more information on other dining options in Singapore, see http://singaporehawker.wordpress.com

Yep. Chili crab is considered as Sing's speciality and No Sign board restaurant is well-established because this is restaurant which created chili-crab. Very very good crab with nice sauce. The dried bread is also nice and matches perfectly with the sauce. I and boyfriend really enjoy it.If you want to save some, you should come with group. I think 1 crab may enough for 3-4 people, surely with bread and rice enclosed. If just 1-2 people, should order small crab for saving.One Singapore friend advice me to order the female crab, it is better due to her eggs. But I forgot it. :((Really want to enjoy chili crab again

This is the old store, and people saying that this branch is cheaper than the other two. As it has no riverfront view, no nice interior design at all. But still, i think it's was a bit overpriced, as i later found out that the restaurants nearby the MRT is much much cheaper, and obviously more local singaporean go there instead.Food:1. White pepper crab (1kg SG$55) Instead of the renowned chilli crab, we orderd this. Taste really good and fresh.  A big meaty one, must eat2. Cereal Prawns Excellent one, rispy sweet cereal mixed with fresh prawns. Taste fresh for us.3. Scallop So so, not so fresh.4. Fried veges So so, a bit old.Two of us (ladies) , >SG$100How to get there?Take MRT to Ajunied (EW9),Exit then turn left-- >Go straight to Sims ave.Turn right--> Ajunied Road--> Turn left to Geylang Road

Their chili crab and pepper crab was fantastico! Loved everything we ordered here but I did feel like the place was overpriced and the service was lacking. They took their own sweet time to bring out the food and drinks.

Decent food at this extremely popular restaurant, which is extremely overpriced.
We had the chilli crab, which apparently is a must. But, actually, it was the least interesting dish on our table.
2
Had chili crab, the crab is not fresh. The portion is not big enough for the price we paid. Jumbo seafood is much better.
5
Not real cheap, but it's money well spent. The food is superb, possibly the best singapore chilli mud crab ever!
5
A legendary place to try out seafood in Singapore in a find dinning setup. There are many branches setup all over the island, do make a reservation in advance for dinner and over the weekends.

Two of the things I wanted to do in Singapore were checking out the bustling 'red light' district of Geylang (really now just a vibrant food and nightlife scene - it's not remotely seedy, at least not where I was), and trying the renowned Chili Crab. This spot, which I found recommended on a foodie blog, was a perfect choice. It has a massive open-air seating space, a huge menu (albeit some of the pricier fare I've encountered in Singapore or elsewhere in Asia), a vibrant atmosphere, and some damn good food. The main event is the chili crab, and you need to get it. It is messy - you need to just dive into that red sauce with your hands and dig into that crab. If you're like me, you'll also want extra rolls to sop up as much of that sauce as you can. Wash it down with a local beer or perhaps the milk of a fresh, cold coconut (I had both).
4
In the heart of the red light district this busy venue attacks a large crowd. Outdoor seating under awning with fans, fish tanks at the back filled with fresh crabs, prawns and frogs and a valet parking service cutting through the seating arrangements. It doesn't look spectacular and for the prices that is what everyone is expecting. The most popular item on the menu is chilli ran but we always have the drunken prawns and you cannot beat these for freshness. A bowl of live prawns is fed some whiskey at your table. When the prawns are drunk (!) they are immersed into a hot broth with ginseng and spices. A few minutes laters they are served. Delicious, great with the stir fried ric

For pictures and full review: http://travelshootandshare.blogspot.sg/2013/05/no-signboard-seafood-geylang-branch.htmlI thoroughly enjoyed my spicy hot chilli crab experience. The sauce was thick with egg and chili. It paired really well with the juicy fat crab which was served on my table. I would suggest getting a coconut for your drink as it will help to quench the spiciness away. A crab cost SGD $55 per kg and one crab weighs approximately 800g - 1.2 kg. Hence, be prepared to splurge on this meal :
5
It's must go (and especially at Geylang road), but only if you are up for a local experience, local food, comfortable with quick and practical at it's extreme service. Must order is a pepper or chilly crab, eaten by hands to enjoy at maximum. Every time we go there, the place is busy, but the staff manage to find a table. Located in a Red Light district of Singapore, the place is reasonable clean, and the food is fantastic. The tables are outside, but the ventilation make the seating easily bearable and enjoying, especially if very cold Tiger bear is your choice

This place was recommended to us so we decided to try it instead of going to the more popular Jumbo chain of restaurants. From the moment we step in one of the waiters acted as we were from out of space and couldn't understand that we were there for lunch and needed to be seated. The other waitress seated us eventually but first needed to know if we had reservations keep in mind that the place had lots of seating , there were only 2 tables occupied at the time. They sat us at a table that was not ready ( no tableware) while the other tables were. We requested to move. We finally got seated and placed our orders. Chili crab, white pepper crab and noodles. The service is slow and we were completely ignored even though as I stated before the place was empty. My friend requested the extra plate to place the shells, ignored. We requested the finger bowls to cleansed our hands, ignored. He finally, got up and helped himself from a nearby table for the items that we needed and that they supposedly were going to bring to us.Our meal was absolutely delicious , a bit pricey for the lack of service. My friend and I requested our bill to be split and you would have thought that I requested a kidney. The so called cashier/manager was rude, kept making mistakes and re-running our cards and used profanity. My friend and I kept calmed throughout this ordeal. At this point we just wanted to pay the bill and get out of this establishment without further incident. They are far better places in Singapore to eat with equally great food and service. Avoid this place especially the one at the Esplanade. I checked my credit card and sure enough she double charged me. Horrible Experience!!!!! Go somewhere else. I don't mind paying for a great meal and good service. I wish that there was a minus star rating
5
Variety of seafood available and yummy crabs! The salted egg crabs is most recommended!!!!! The toasted man tou goes well with chilli crabs. Rest of seafoods are great too!!! Location is convenient with car or by taxi.
5
This one is actually my most favorite place for chillicrab in town. It is the best among No Signboards in Sing.
Beside the crab, the fried rice and special honey pork ribs should not be missed.
4
Crab was great and the service excellent also had the buttered lobster but not quite as good as the crab enjoy
4
I like the chilli crabs from this place. I think they serve the best chilli crabs in town. Also like the mee goreng. The one located at Geylang is the best branch. The rest are not bad too.
1
I was passed by here with a friend last week,there has a lot of customers dining here make us felt want to join in.We order quite few dishes : Yang Zhou fried rice,claypoy toufu,'champagne' chicken,seafoods soup and fried asparagus.Let me explain everything,i know it might be too busy to prepare and cook the foods,but i don't think customer would pay $12-$20 per dish and receive the bad quality food.Yang Zhou fried rice was not too bad,claypot toufu with totally no taste(chef forgot to add seasoning?),'champagne' chicken was over what we expected,it was only deepfried chicken with orange sauce,seafoods soup was boiled water and seafoods without seasoning too,fried asparagus was rough cut and fried,no appetite at all once we saw the presentation.Only one thing we appreciated is staffs who served us were really kind and smile all the way
4
This was the first time I went to No Signboard on Geylang Road. I've been to the other branch at Eastcoast Seafood Center before and wasn't as impressed as the Geylang branch. Although located on the busy Geylang Road, the restaurant is clean with rather nice ambience in itself. Staff speaks good English and has full knowledge of the menu. Their ingredients were very fresh. We went rather late in the afternoon so food arrived fast enough. Not sure how it will be during regular meal time which is usually packed. We ordered bamboo clams steamed with garlic, S$12.- each, which I thought, was expensive, compared to Red House Seafood Restaurant I ate the night before, only S$8.- a piece. Well, it turned out the size was much bigger and even one clam could fill you up. I ordered two for myself and I could barely ate anything else. The meat was very tender and sweet. However, I found the cereal prawns to be too dry, but the prawns were fresh and sweet. The bill wasn't as steep as some reviewers found. Rather, I think it was the same as most seafood restaurants in Singapore of the same standard
5
If you're lookin for seafood, this restaurant is a must-try. Their Chili crab is delicious as well as the boiled/steamed broccoli. So good that you'll end up eating with your hands. The staff are very accomodating and the place is ideal for business meetings. Situated at the rooftop with the view of swimming pools, it is indeed relaxing.
4
Having been to this restaurant... And JUST read the reviews... I can understand where some of the bad reviews have come from!You Have to remember that this restaurant started and still basically is a HAWKER!!!!! Food is great and casual...The night I went ... Place was full... Service was wonderful... Even took us to the kitchen so we could get BEFORE shots of the crab!!!!Would recommend highly... But don't expect FINE DINING service!!!!When you choose your crab... You can get either ARTIC or local... And you pay accordingly!!!
4
Make sure you only visit the Geylang location, it's the best one. Must have chili-crab, must have chili-crab....did I mention the chili crab? The cost is dirt cheap compared to San Francisco crab prices. So flavorful and messy too (be warned, they charge you if you request extra wet-naps, and YOU WILL REQUEST EXTRA). Make sure to order the little bits of bread donuts for use in sopping up the gravy.Oh yeah, had some noodle dishes too...can't get the chili-crab out of my mind.**The following has nothing to do with the restaurant, it's just anecdotal:Afterward, you can stroll the surrounding neighborhood streets where you'll find lots of she-male and other assorted working girls looking for clients....it's a part of Singapore that most tourists don't get to experience; quite the show
4
Not much food choices in Singapore but everytime I visit there I will dine there. Chili crab is my favourite. Although the price have increased a let since my first visit more than 18 years ago, the standard of the dish maintains. I was once introduced the Pepper Crab, but I still prefers the Chilli Crab
3
No signboard in Geylang is a bit of an icon and gets very busy which means its not the most relaxing atmosphere which coupled with plastic tables, long queues and high prices means its one I wouldn't recommend.
4
A little expensive but we enjoyed our chilli crab and shrimp. They are excellent! A messy business, would be wise to bring your own wipes as I didn't get enough. $320 for two of us.
2
Mostly tourists. Food court turned outdoor restaurant. Seafood tanks not very clean. Spicy crab has so much sauce that you can't taste crab. Would have preferred a different seafood restaurant.
5
The food had great flavours and quantity. They offer fast service and always attend to you promptly.
2
chilli crab smothered in thick glugy sweet sauce. Pepper crab was a bit better. Service was slow, we were in a large group so they then brought ALL the food at once, all 9 dishes and it kept coming.
5
Their must try dishes are white pepper crabs, black pepper crabs and cereal crayfish. They're all my all time favourites. One of the best place for seafood in S'pore.
4
This being a famous place, the prices are robust. But we had to try the chili crab and the pork.The chili crab was large and delicious. It wasn't spicy hot or at all overwhelming which is an achievement for such a heavy sauce. Excellent.With the other dishes alos worthy of mention, the bill was pretty expensive, especially as we had 3 kids in our group who are small eaters.Defintely try it, but be awarer of the prices
4
This is the famous original location for no Signboard.We were AL fresco at a table almost on the street , in this busy neighborhood.My suggestion is arrive early and have a beer at one of the hundreds of Al fresco bars in this busy area.We had Singapore Crab, drunken prawns, lemon style chicken and a mushroom & asparagus dish.They were all great, the Singapore Crab was very hot and the stock with the drunken prawns was delicious and the pricing was fair, not cheap but good value
4
I bet when this restaurant first opened up it was superb. Best quality seafood, quick service, and amazing flavours. You still get all that to a certain degree, but I just feel that probably No Signboard is a victim of its own success. Don't get me wrong - it's still Very Good, still 100 times better than anything you can get in London or Australia, but I bet there are better places to go in Singapore, as yet undiscovered, and unlikely to be discovered by me as I don't go to Singapore often enough! Unless you know a local who can recommend somewhere better, just stick with No Signboard - you'll love it
4
Cannot claim to be very experienced about this cuisine but whatever we ordered was very tasty be it Chilli prawns, stir fried pepper chicken and seafood fried rice...The place is big, noisy, you have your food sitting virtually next to a very busy road but that's all part of the ambience of the place which works!!The service the couple of times we have gone is friendly though the servers are not realky fluent in english
5
Couldn't fault the food - we opted for a set menu which included the infamous Singapore crabs, shark fin's soup, sweet sticky prawns, fried rice and few other dishes which I can't remember. The service was not that great until it was time to pay.
4
We came in group of four people. We all agreed that the crab fried rice and the green coconut water were more than extraordinary. The staffs were helpful (don't speak chinese btw). Need to pay more for the napkins, bit uncommon.
4
LOVED our meal here, especially the coffee-coated ribs! You will need a reservation because it is a Singapore favorite and is packed. Only wish is for more napkins and a bit more attentive staff, but otherwise, it's a gem!
4
Service is good and so is the food. We always go back to this place everytime we visit singapore.
Try the salted egg crab if you want a change from the usual chili crab.
3
Went to the geylang road branch for a late lunch so the place wasn't as crowded. Got a table at the open air section although tables are also available at the air conditioned section of the restaurant.Service was ok nothing special. I felt though that our order taker kept recommending the pricier items on their menu.The food was delicious although a bit pricey. Chili crab was good. The crab meat itself was sweet perfectly complimented by the chili sauce. The cereal prawns are also worth mentioning
3
I went to the geyland road location and tried the signature dish black pepper crabs. May be the crabs are not in season as the one I had was quite "skinny" with not much crabmeat. The clam is not big either. Have to add extra money on almost everything. If you want vermicelli on your clam, pay extra. Extra wet napkin, pay extra. Tea and water are not complimentary.

Last week sat down at this place for a good meal. As we are not locals, got a menu list with prices for many simple set menus well over 100 dollar. Got the very strong impression that certain type of visitors get another menu with different prices than others... The prices we were given would never be paid for by locals I guess. 10 dollar per clam! Hey?A place to stay away from

Went here to get some food around 4pm. I decided to order the chili chicken - medium for $15. They charged for the glass of water, the paper napkins, $1 for a half full small bowl of rice. Worst of all the $15 for the chicken barely feeds 1 person, and was without almost any flavor without the hot sauce I had to make it tolerable. Never stepping inside here again

After reading all the reviews about the various Nosign Board restaurants we decided to go to this one. Having eaten crab at Jumbo this was another ' must do'. First the area- A bit on the shady side of town- the pavements were crowded by members of the oldest profession. The bars were seedy but we got cheap beer even though we needed the help of the next table to translate my cantonese to mandarin. English is not spoken in these 'open air' bars- tables on the pavement of a busy city road.The restaurant was basically in a big open hall and we got a table without booking.The crab was tasty - chilli crab better than Jumbo but the pepper crab was the opposite. The prawns were excellent. Not expensive but also not cheap.One word of advice- avoid the Durian pudding. The smell and taste stays with you all night.And take a taxi home
1
The service is incredibly lousy. I had come here with friends from overseas, and when they requested for forks and spoons to replace the chopsticks- it never came. We had to resort to using our hands.They hardly waited at our table although it was a large group and even to get the bill took a great amount of time and effort. We got so tired of waiting that we even skipped the pre-ordered desserts.Coming from Malaysia and having had seafood in other restuarants in Singapore, the food is nothing to shout about. Price is too high for this level of quality of food and service
4
Go with big group, it will make your dinner experience worth!
Order the Chilli Crab and also fried Sotong.
Eating with a big group will cost each person to pay cheaper.
5
I have been there three times and it always was delicious. A bit expensive compared to other places, however, worth the view on the restaurant close to the esplanade.
4
Food is perfect, nothing else. Waitress dont speak english! Location is not the best. But food, food is really really perfect. Must try.
1
Famous, but tremendously overpriced. Only for tourists. Crabs are ok but I would not go there again.
4
Lots people are there for their chili crab :) I am not very good in having chili crab and I find it challenging :) but other than chili crab..the other dishes are good too..it was my first time to this restaurant and I got to know that during weekend..there will be oldies mini concert just outside the restaurant..if you don;t mind on the noise or you enjoy oldies...do try out their chili crab..tasty with the man tou :
4
Chili & Pepper crab is a must try forget about other stuffs. Succulent meat and flavorful taste, chili crab sauce goes very well with Chinese bun, niceeeee! If you are a fan of noodles, try the Mee Goreng (Malay fried noodle), a pleasant surprise! Price is wee bit pricey but hey worth it
3
Still as it was over twenty years ago. The Chilli crab still wonderful the restaurant in the East Coast Seafood Centre was looking tied tho' although the views after dark made it worth the visit. Remember to book your return cab into town or expect a very long wait especially at the weekends
5
This has become one the mandatory places for me to eat when I get to Singapore. My mate lives in Geylang a short walk away and introduced me to this place. I love the fact that I can land at Changi airport after the flight from chilly London and literally 30 minutes later be sitting in shorts and t-shirt drinking Tiger beers and eating chilli crab.It's all about the seafood here and specialties are the crab (chilli, back pepper and white pepper), razor clams and prawns. Best to go there with a few friends so that you get to try all of the dishes on offer without reaching food overload
4
I went there with few friends, as you know geyland area was very busy. This restaurant have few branches but my friend said this one is the best! As we expected we had chili crab and pepper crab, pretty descent price as we offer with value banquet along with fried rice, one choice of vegetable dish and one prawn dish. All are delicious! will definitely come back again
5
I honestly don't think this is a difficult decision - if you are in Singapore eat here! (I should just finish my review here but I won't).There is a never ending list of things to eat. Local seafoods, to the more exotic: Crocodile, Deer and Bull Frog. But don't let this multiple page menu intimidate you. We ate chilli crab, deep fried prawns and a vegtable noodle dish - these were all recommended to us by our friendly server. The food was amazing and the night was great fun. Crab is never going to be the easiest food to eat, so you just have to get stuck in and enjoy the experience. And because it was messy, the servers continue to bring you finger bowls of warm water and clean napkins.The service was amazing, probably (awkwardly) the best service I have had with regard to drinks. Obviously it's hot in Singapore and you would like your drink to be cold and to ensure that you have this they put our big beer bottles in a wine cooler and then continued to decant our beer from our glass into a new frozen glass, they did this so often that the beer stayed icy cold and perfect.Please enjoy it as much as I did.I would like to note for full disclosure that you do eat outside in the Geylang district and the food is moderately priced but not cheap
5
They got the best white pepper crab in town !! Of coz chilli crab is also good there ... other food is fine ... price is reasonable ...
4
Have been there several times. Always fresh and good service. Taken friends/staff and always enjoyed it.
3
Over rated, over priced the service was possibly the worst i have en-counted....they were busy yes...but 50 min for starter....then another one hour twenty till main was served.....great location...that is about the only good thing i have to say about this establishment.
5
Again, this is just another outstanding place to eat in Singapore, its just a shame people miss out on it. The fried deer meat with onions is amazing and then the absolute best is the Chili crab. We frequent this place every chance we get. The staff are great and the Tiger beer girls wont let you go thirsty..Real Trea
4
If you want a local experience, I recommend No Signboard in Geylang. Famous spot and good food. Best to go in a big group so you can get many dishes to try. I recommend the White Pepper crab over the Chili crab, but it's all up to preference.
5
Just down the road from my house. With all the crab choice in Singers, everyone has their fave and this mine. Nothing beats the white pepper crab at No Name East Coast! Must be accompanied by a Tiger. Best on balmy night with great friends or family.Book on weekend
4
A friend of ours treated us to the chilli crabs at No Signboard which were pretty good (being an Indian, my palate expected more spice!). The quality of the meat was just splendid! However, the highlight of the meal was the cereal prawns (you just cannot get enough of the cereal topping).I accomplished my mission of trying a meat I had never tasted before with bamboo clams (they actually look pretty!) topped with fried garlic and chives! Oh so good!The place is rather brightly lit so it works best with friends or family (you need people to share the huge quantities of food they serve)
5
I didn't have have high expectations seeing tripadvisor rating was short of excellent but went anyway for my first chili crab experience. Boy, was I blown away! They were the best and juiciest crab I had ever tasted! The chili crab gravy was amazing; not too spicy and very creamy. A taste that surprised me coz I never had it that way. Ordered steamed garlic crayfish too and the sauce that came with it was so refreshing; light soy with basil, chili, galic & lime. Overall the best food I had on my whole trip. Highly recommended.Tip: Go at ard 3-4pm to avoid lunch/dinner crowd. You could take your time savoring the crabs
3
I had heard that the chili crab was good eats so we set out for a place to get some. This place was recommended to we took a trip there.It was not easy to find! You have to go into the Esplanade, up the stairs & continue straight down the hall. Then go down the escalators on your left and turn right once you get off the escalators. Head towards the outside, turn right & walk straight (follow the curvature of the building). Its on your right/you'll run into it.There's a sign out front that says something like "Please wait for host to be seated". So we obeyed and stood outside for nearly 5 minutes before we walked inside the restaurant. Once inside, no one was there to greet us or take us to a table. We had to wave, and give a quick shout out to grab someone's attention.I was a bit shocked at the price. The price is determined by weight and the least expensive crab (Australian) was S$150/kilo. (I was thinking maybe spending that much for the two of us as I had seen chili crab elsewhere for S$56 per person.) The two other options were Sri Lankan crab (market price) and Antartic or Artic crab S$200. Despite English being the national language, our waitress had a difficult time explaining things to us. We tried to keep it simple and asked for her recommendation, which was the Australian crab. (And good thing too since apparently Sri Lankan's dump their dead into rivers which results in larger & juicier crabs...) Good thing we only ordered on as the bowl was huge. The crab was a decent size too but its the chili broth/soup its sitting in that's quite a serving. The server asked us if we wanted him to open up the crab, so we said yes. With a huff he snatches up the plate and loudly hollers something in Chinese to someone else. You could tell by the body language he wasn't happy about it. (Then why offer?) He came back and our waitress came with gloves and scissors confirming we wanted help. We told her we were happy to do it ourselves if we had the proper tools but she didn't quite understand. (I mean, they didn't even give us the standard crab cracking utilities to get into it - how else were we supposed to do it?)The dish was nice but not something I would order again.Oh and when they sit you down they give you peppers and peanuts. Unbeknownst to you however is that they charge you for it if you touch it
1
Just terrible. No service, poor attitude starting with the grumpy no smile reception lady with rude response to all customers queries, poor quality food..so salty we have to wash down the food with water, way overpriced for a crappy crab at SGD240, and charge for naptin??? We made the biggest mistake to come to this restaurant. PERIOD
4
The Seafood selection is good. The Chili Crab is tasty compared to some other reputable seafood restaurants. The prices are reasonable as well.
4
One of our favorites. Always order the prawns, crab and a vegetable. Constantly good and busy and the food is fresh. Maybe not the best in Singapore but it does the job for us every time. One suggestion it pays to book.
5
I always eat at the No Signboard in Esplanade everytime I am in Singapore. I love the chili crabs, white pepper crabs, cereal prawns and baby squid!
5
The chilli crab and Man Tao very very good . Good place company or family farewell
4
Generally the food was good. Can't comment on the value as I was entertained by a bank.
5
the white pepper crabs are unique and excellent! Order the pork rib king too!
The dim sum at No signboard vivo is also very good.
4
This is is another venue unique to Singapore. An exotic and homegrown menu that was born in the hawker stalls and grown into a nice sit-down restaurant. Have a meal at Maxwell Road Hawker stalls one day then eat here another night and you'll appreciate the upward mobility and economic opportunity that is Singapore. Be prepared to try something different. Don't miss: The Chili Crab
4
I was recommended this place by a work acquaintance so I went there specifically. Interesting enough as soon as I arrived I was told that for the pepper crab there was a wait of minimum one hour, I guess to avoid complaint later. In fact, the food did not take that long and was good. The place might not be the fanciest and the service not the warmest but I would probably go there again..
3
I heard about the famous of the No Signboard Seafood. I am not sure if we dun know how to order or what, I feel like it is kind of overrated. This doesn't means the food is not good. The food is average but not as good as I imagined, especially the crab. We ordered the butter cream crab, nothing special about this
1
First there was a wait of x minutes ( after eating here I wonder why). Opted for the Set Meal for 219 SD. The menu was not provided in order, the abalone came first, though on the menu it was the lobster, the crab came last - though it was to follow the abalone. They gave 1 handbowl and 1 crabcracker initially- for a set meal for 2 persons. It took them roughly 25 minutes to get the first order and about 20 minutes thereafter ! Each time someone else would come- total chaos !They had put in some peanuts and some vinegar sauce.When the bill came, they had billed us 2.00 SD for it- man talk about cheap. And not to mention 1 Sing Dollar for towels - holy crap. The bill came to 280 SGD - including their service charge ( better to call it "no service" charge). Essentially, we had averaged over 100 USD per head - for a crap meal on plastic plates -where they charged us 1 dollar for napkins! All for a tab - that in most cities would get you a decent meal at a Michelin star rated chef restuarant. And yes- the food was average or below average- across the 5 dishes in the set menu. Don't bother with this one- it's a crappy restaurant.
4
Fresh, well made food - especially sea food. Relaxed ambience
3
This place has been voted to have the best chili crab in Sing. I frankly think that this place is way over priced, extremely loud family type restaurant, and the food was only okay. DON'T EAT SHARK FIN SOUP!
5
Excellent Chilli Crab, even though a bit pricey. But the service is great, and you won't get lemon water to wash your hands and napkins at a hawker stand.
4
good, wholesome Chinese food. I enjoy their ambience but I think the menu at Jumbo is better. They charge for every little thing like peanuts, but at the end of the meal you are satisfied. Not the height of gourmet, but good nonetheless.
4
We had garlic fried vegetables, mango fried chicken and squid and it was all very good. Hard to compare it to other places in Singapore though as it was our first night.
4
Famous peper crab, you can choose either white or black pepper. all amazingly delicious! but you better order some drinks with it, ideally beer. coz its buring hot!
2
tons of better seafood around than this place.. overpriced and over rated
3
I guess this place is good only for its pepper crab which I still think is one of the best in Singapore. But everything else on the menu seems disappointing. So I would go there only for the crab.
4
Great seafood!This used to be a hawker stall in the early 90's way out in Tuas and it literally had no signboard as it was unnamed. They have always had great seafood but have risen to become more expensive. However, the food still remains great!The breaded tiger prawns, drunken prawns, white pepper crab and lobster salad are delicious!Their location on East Coast is great as you have views out to sea
4
Ate here on a Saturday night. Geylang branch is very "street food" in atmosphere, but you don't come here for the environment, but for the first rate white pepper crab and mantou.It is entirely possible that their branches at posh locations such as Esplanade and Vivo City don't measure up, but in that case, you still have the Geylang and ECP locations to choose from. I really miss their Kallang stadium branch, which was like dining inside a palace with great crab to boot. Without a classy backdrop, even great food and company are not enough to overcome such an obvious fault, which is why Geylang branch only gets 4 stars from me
4
This restaurant does local seafood well at reasonable prices.
5
Best crabs I ever ate was at this restaurant. Its expensive but you can argue that its almost worth your every dollar. Just savour it!
3
Went to the one at Vivocity- posh looking but the service and food was short of everything posh. I almost had to berate the manager on duty as it was my mother's birthday and they were ruining it.
4
We have eaten at the location at Esplanade. The food is really good and you will want to sample a lot of entrees, so go with a big group, order a lot and share. Sauces are delicately flavored!
3
Due to its publicity,it's very crowded during weekends n public holidays.There r other options with less crowd n more reasonable pricing n most importantly,they r jus as delicious.
5
We loved the slick service and the price was good also!

I visited this restaurant with my partner last Friday and was VERY disappointed. The service was indifferent, we were made to sit outside when we had been told a table was available inside for us and the food was, at best, average. We were staying at the Swissotel The Stamford (nice hotel btw) and the concierge recommended this place - I have no idea why.When we arrived, there was a rock concert going on in the outside arena right next to the restaurant - so conversation was done via the medium of shouting at one another whilst we enjoyed the humidity and poor service.We ordered a set menu which was Â£200 for two people. The food came in the wrong order and was incomplete. When we pointed out that we hadn't had one of the dishes, they started checking through our leftovers in case we were lying. We were provided with one wet wipe each (the food is messy) and no napkin. Wine was served from single serving airline style bottles - although I did laugh when the waiter showed my partner the label in the style of a real restaurant! I thought about asking to smell the cork just for fun...The food in the set menu consisted of a large crab which seemed to have had all the nice meat removed from the carcass - following this it was smashed up, covered in pepper and thrown in a bowl. Yum! The abalones could have been mushrooms as far as I could tell. The only nice part was the half of a small lobster that we had each. Desert was nondescript mango goo.If you need to visit the lavatory - use the public toilet just down the way, they don't have one.When the bill came I was amazed to see we were charged another $2 as we had the temerity to request a further napkin each.This place is a total ripoff, it ruined our evening and the only good part is that we can now laugh about it...AVOID AVOID AVOID
1
After waiting for about 2 hours, we got a table outside with mosquitoes. Yes, no tables were available in the air-con room. Hardly could we see a waitor after having been seated for sometime. Waitors were busy. We ordered fried pepper crab which finally came after 50 mins with our continuous reminders. The crab came. The body shell was cold. The waitor said that was the way because it was for deocration. OK! We finally tasted the crab, which was small and really not good at all. It cost HK$400. A big thank! No more next time
2
The waitress pushed us into order the Australian crab for the Chili Crab we ordered. She told us it was 1.6kg. Even the waiter giving us the bill said, "That does not look like a 1.6kg crab, let me check if they made a mistake." Of course, his manager came back insisted on that was how much the crab weight. The crab alone was $240!! For the two of us, we ended up spending more than $400. It didn't even cost us that much at some of the top seafood restaurants in New York. The service was really crappy. Everything we wanted to add, even a bowl of rice, was not available for another twenty minutes because they told us that they were too busy. I do NOT recommand this restaurant, at least not the one in the Esplanade mall
4
First of all, I heard a lot of this chain restaurant. It is actually good, like what people say. But it's very expensive (and touristy) as well. My husband and I ordered a medium (~1.5 kg) Sril Lankan crab, cooked in white pepper style. With that, we ordered a Sambal Kang Kong ($12 medium) and Crispy Cereal prawns ($20 for 6-7 prawns). The whole meal was delicious and pleasant. But the bill was steep as well. We paid ~$140-150 for two persons. Will I go back? Maybe. Tip: they charge $2 or so for the peanuts that we didn't order. Tell them no if you don't want it. Also they charge for the wet towels as well.
1
Too expensive and food ordinary, very busy, noisy, staff unfriendly and rushed.
5
Go with a group of at least 6 people, so you can order multiple dishes and share. It's all so good, escpeially the black pepper and chili crabs. Prices for food and beer/wine are quite ok
4
Normally, im a beef and chicken type good but glad that i got to try this place. I got to try some unique items like the baby squid, but i really enjoyed it. The breaded shrimp was really yummy
5
Every time we visit sing we make sure to drop by this resto and order their chilli crabs with fried bun yumyumyum!
2
Food is honestly ok. There is nothing wrong with the food and some you can only taste better here. But you could see that for some dishes you could get it done cheaper and still taste the same elsewhere.
1
we went to the outlet @Central next to Clarke Quay.Food was just ok, service was slow. The waitress deliberately sold us afr too much food despite beinga sked if we had ordered too much food. There was only the 2 of us, the waitress says " its ok I have only given you small portions" and then promptly brings us a tasting plate for 4 people.Our service was slow and inconsistent, and yet the table of chinese Gentlemen behind us had waiters clamouring all over them.This place is very expensive and is designed to take more money from tourists pockets and they dont particularly care how they do it
3
It is a better hawker stall but the prices are double and more. There were no dishes below 8 SGD.The crab for 50 SGD is good though. I ate a crab in the area for 22 SGD but the black pepper sauce was too intense. One thing i really didnt like was, that they put 10g. of nuts among some chilis and chili souce on your table and charge you promptly 2 SGD if you touch them.
1
Really looked forward to eating the chilli crab from this restaurant after it was featured in Asian Food Channel amongst others. What a huge disappointment it was in quality taste and service. The taxi driver who took us from the airport to the hotel warned us that the original cook had left and that the standard has dropped. I was unhappy to find out that he us telling us the truth. As is true for most of the trip to Spore, the standard of food has gone to the dogs as 'famous' hawker food names have expended to the detriment of quality. Our whole trip was marred by sub-par taste which was not the case just a few years ago
4
Set on the Esplanade on Marina Bay, this is a busy restaurant. Very nice outside terrace, with typical no-nonsense Chinese interior restaurant. Good set menus, although not cheap by any means, with quirky plastic plates and bare tables makes you concentrate opn what's really important; the food
3
we asked one of our singaporean friends to take us to a nice resataurant (7 persons) and we would pay the bill. A couple of us had been in 2010 to Jumbos and and had a great feast of cerel prawns and back pepper crab. we ordered this again at no signboard and did not find it anything like the ones we had at jumbos. service was not that good for a restaurant of this quality and as expected the price was way over the top for what we got. In july this year we will be back in singapore with new friends and will be looking at going back to jumbos for our fix of prawns and crabs. If any of the readers have other places to recommend we are open to suggestions
4
The chilli crab was absolutely delicious. It was spicy but not overpowering. And the meat was succulent.
4
Ordered the drunken prawns, black pepper bullfrog, butter lobster, seafood fried rice, and of course chili crab. The fried rice is amazing! Would definitely go back.
5
Go for the White Pepper Crabs and Drunken Prawns. Yummilicious!!!
1
There is no way this restaurant is as famous as Jumbo seafood.
Everything I had for dinner was way below any food standard.
Look just few steps away before you seat.
2
In comparing the East Coast outlet directly to Jumbo nearby, neither the food nor the service was up to snuff. Wouldn't mind if the prices were considerably less, but they are the same. By Singapore standards just a rather over-hyped expensive seafood chain.
4
So far I found the best branch is at Geylang. Love the chilli crab.
1
Terrible place to eat in. After taking some of my soup, i found a short string of hair in my soup. I pointed out to waiter, all i got was a replacement soup. I was told that everyone in the kitchen wear cap and the implication is it could not be the restaurant fault. It's as if I put the hair in myself!spoilt my whole meal
1
terrible food and service. was a disaster. never has such a bad crab and we got sick afterwards too. i think we interrupted the waiters lunch as she came to take our orders with a mouthful of food. i found hair in my soup and the waiter promptly informed me it looked like an eyelash and walked away. first time for everything, perhaps he should have been a hairdresser.we left it was so ba
4
Had steamed crab, very nice and tasty rest of family had black pepper crab ans various other selections, but the staff where very standoffish and could not care less, I think the lady who served us was part owner or perhaps owner. Not impressed, would not go again as the restaurants on Longbeach were great quality and friendly service with a smile
4
This place is rightly famed for its seafood. We had chiili crab, which was delicious but very messy to eat (roll your sleeves up, if you have any!), cereal prawns - so good we ordered more, and a few other dishes too. Great fun, good value and fabulous food
1
Food = so so. not even better than hawker food.
Pricing = Over rated. You can get better food with that kind of price. Don't wasted your money there.
4
This is a very nice upscale resturant. The one I visited was in the Central shopping center. Great food, but be prepared to pay be the chili or pepper crab. It isn't cheap, but very good.
5
Must-orders: Any of the Chili crabs, shrimps with shavings, their bread
Try reserving a table near the servers or in the middle (not along the sidelines) so that the servers can attend to you quicker
3
This place feels like a street market but is the only place occupying the site. It has hustle and atmosphere and the staff are as attentive as the hawkers in a real street market. The kitchen is great vista and theatre. The chili crab is good not great or excelent but good. At the end of the day my vote goes to the Indian Green Chile Crab at Cuppage Rd just off Orchard Rd. Second place is a real tourist dive, the Chinatown Seafood Cafe,Tiger beer only $6. Fortingto
4
I visited the No Signboard Seafood on Eu Tong Sen road. It is located at The Central Mall. The mall is directly connected to the Clarke Quay MRT station, and the restaurant is on the 4th floor. This is relatively unknown for visitors and you don't need to make a revervation ahead of time. So if you are a visitor and cannot find a table at Jumbo's, this can be a very good alternative. In my opinion, No Signboard chilli crab is better than the one at Jumbo. Be sure that you visit the restaurant on Eu Tong Sen road because I heard the other branches have bad quality service
2
At the recommendation from friends and family, the three of us visited No Signboard tonight and it seemed like a good thing with the open air, fish tanks, noise from the street. Service was good in terms of getting our order in, but we then received the food at various times, had to ask where our chili crab was and routinely had to keep asking for the next thing - food, the bill. Food was not hot, just warm and we didn't think the chili crab was very chili-ish. So not value for the money or the food. Not going back is our final thought on this one
4
No Signboard is one of many seafood restaurants in Singapore where is recommended by local people this. It is nothing fancy, but the food was incredible. All of the food is swimming around in tanks outside. My favorite dish was the Sri Lankan black pepper crab, washed down with Tiger beer, of course. Amazing! We also had the chili crab, which is good, but I don't think it compares to the pepper crab
4
We went to try the chilli crab on a recommendation from a friend. We opted for the banquet which included chilli crab as well as abalone. The chilli crab was delicious and plentiful. It was quite expensive, but not bad value given the premium ingredients. A little lacking in atmosphere, but overall a great meal
4
There are numerous 'no signboard' outlets around Singapore, and lots of options for crabs. But the best is the one in Geylang. You sit outside on flimsy plastic chairs, sometimes in a parking lot. It is in one of the red light districts of Singapore, so a lot very questionable looking clubs around, and girls that whose profession you certainly don't have much question about. But best crabs in the city, chili, black pepper, and white pepper. The cereal prawns are also extremely good. As a personal preference i don't understand why they would put the coating on a shell that you are going to take off, but you can ask for de-shelled before they put on. Even though it is in a sketchy neighborhood, there is no problem. Taxis know it. Easy to get a taxi after you're done. If you are going with a group a reservation is probably advisable
4
I went with business colleagues to the Marina Bay location. Location is very convenient to the marina bay hotels and is right on the bay. Wonderful view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel - sit outside and watch the laser light show while you eat, and enjoy the entertainment in the outdoor arena. and people watch ! Menu is very large with wide variety of seafoods, ribs, frog legs, deer meat, noodles, buns, rice, veggies all prepared many ways. Famous for their chili crab. We had chili crab, coffee ribs (wow), scallops, noodles, fried buns - lots of leftovers. Everything was prepared fresh and we received it as it was cooked so the meal was leisurely - took about 2 hours to get all the food, but worth the wait as it was all piping hot
4
expensive but worth it. i love their chilli crabs and salted egg prawns. must try when you are there !
5
Many associates and friends have asked me about the famed Chilli Crabs in Singapore. I receommend No SIgnboard in Geyland Road. The sauce is about the best in town! DO GIVE IT A TRY!!!!
5
If you are a big fan of crabs, you have to try the pepper crabs. Ordered chilli crabs as well, but I tasted better. Also, it was 4 of us, so the dinner package for 4 is a value for money. The crispy cereal prawns is awesome
4
My son and I went here on the night of the Grand Prix....it is within the boundaries of the Grand Prix and was a great escape from the heat and the crowds. As we needed to be in and out quickly, the fast service was just what we needed.We ordered a buffet meal and all dishes were interesting, very local and very good! The highlight was of course the chilli crab! Taste was great...nice and hot...just a bit fiddly, but when you got a good chunk of crab meat out....mmmm!The only dish I would avoid in future was the abalone...just not my cup of tea. Otherwise, it was a good meal, great service, great location, but perhaps a bit pricey. Worth a try and i
4
this is our first time in Singapore and visited this restaurant on our first night, the staff were friendly and helpful, advising us on the menu, we had deer meat and thai chicken, it was great food, along with the drinks (large bottle Tiger beer $6), very reasonably priced
2
Located in Geylang, perhaps the "uniqueness" of this seafood restaurant is that it is called No Signboard. Reputed to be commercialised after getting well-known, the restaurant can still be packed to brim on weekends. Unfortunately either I have ordered the wrong seafood, or that it's no longer worth the big bucks you are paying for a simple seafood restaurant. Tried ordering the drunken prawns but they no longer cook it even though it is in the menu. I ordered Singapore's famed black pepper crabs, and it was cooked wrongly. What was supposed to be dry stir-fry, black peppery delicious crabs, turned out to be stir-fry crabs with a bit of black pepper sauce. With a fresh prawn broth and the black pepper crabs, the bill came to about S$70. Not cheap for a simple seafood restaurant, definitely not what I would called value for money
4
I have only had chili crab a few times in Singapore but this one was by far my favorite. I was seated quickly but the service was a bit slow and you are charged for EVERYTHING. But I do believe it was the same way at a couple of other restaurants in Singapore so maybe that is just a local custom. Overall I would recommend at least checking this place out. One last thing is that it is outdoors and has very little in the way of a breeze. I am from Phoenix AZ so can handle some heat but this was the most miserable I have ever been

Super expensive place to eat seafood though the food was quite scrumptious. The crayfish beehoon which is one of their signature dishes besides the crabs is very good but it cost me a whopping $117 just for that dish! The crab is well cooked and flavored but it's freshness and texture of the crab meat is not worth the price I paid for - 1 large crab costing $76. The other dishes are the norm and servings are quite small even when we ordered large size. What bridled me was they charged me for plain water - $7 for 7 glasses! That's absurd! To think that I also paid about $8-9 for a large bottle of carlsburg... That means we might jolly well drink beer instead of plain water. That's bad business ethics. I also had to pay for the wet towels sealed in plastic bags and groundnuts and pickles. They are not reasonably priced too.My verdict is this restaurant is a ripped off. I can enjoy very good seafood at a fraction of what they are charging at other great seafood eateries in Singapore. Will not recommend this place to anyone unless they don't mind getting milked

The cereal prawns were absolutely delicious. I was disappointed w/ the chili crabs; they were not as spicy as I expected. I wished we had gotten the white pepper crabs instead. There was a live band playing nearby, w/c was great for the ambiance, together w/ the view of the twinkling lights of the Merlion & the Marina Bay Sands. We took lots of pictures after dinner. I would bring a first time visitor to the city here. But I myself would rather eat where the locals really go to have their chili crabs

Actually I visit no sign board restaurant at Vivo City Mall.I order 1 chili crab (srilangka crab - enough for two person), tofu and 2 rice.The chili crab was very great !!! I think the best chili crab ever !!! If you like spicy sauce with gravy egg and crab egg, this is the place you should go. But, I waited more than 45 minutes for the chili crab even the restaurant wasnt so crowded and it already 9 PM. I got the chili crab after I finished the tofu and the rice :(The tofu was standard and not worth it for about USD 10 per portion. 1 chili crab was worth about USD 40. But I think it is worth it

one kilo of crab is $25; too much compared to china town. this is a chinese resto and food served are no different from china town

Great crab - even the cheapest Sri Lankan crab was very good. Great for large groups too.

Going to this place is like hitting two birds with one stone. Its location is in a singapore landmark and the food is very good. Its rather expensive and very hard to get a table specially if you dont have reservations. Crab dishes are very good. The food here can be had in other restaurants in Singapore at the fraction of the price but its very famous and people who visit the Lion City talk about it all the time so i really suggest you visit this restaurant whenever youre in Singapore. Clever name..

We ate at the No Signboard in Esplanade. The restaurant was packed. We made a reservation to get a table that evening. Service was slow. The food was just alright. I had high expectations since it was recommended by a number of friends. But the food was not as good as I expected it to be. It wasn't outstanding nor memorable. I think we could easily eat the same dishes with better taste at the hawkers. We ordered the pepper crabs, a whole fish which the waitress recommended, and fried rice

Seafood City... now this is a must do when in Singapore. A great range of seafood restaurants to choose from, and most places with broad menus. The view was also right on to the harbour with many a cargo ship. Really enjoyed this one.Really enjoyed the meal at this restaurant. The ambience was lovely and started to fill very quickly after 6pm. The service was prompt at all times. The delivery of the food was also super fast. Always helps when one is famished. Ordered the Cuttlefish with XO sauce (the least liked of the three dishes I ordered); Mee Goreng, and the Shiitake mushrooms with vegetables. The Asparagus in this dish was just amazingly fresh and crunchy. Excellent choices. Would also recommend to try the fresh young coconut drink, that is the coconut juice served inside the coconut. One just wasn't enough, however restraint had to be applied. The cold Barely drink was also a hit.Prices overall were reasonable for the excellent standard of seafood served, however I am not a fan of being charged for fresh hand wipes that are often a standard, complimetary offering in other restaurants. Was charged 40 cents for each

We eat at No Signboadr Geylang quite frequently and compared to some of the other big name seafood places in Singapore, this one still serves some of the best pepper/chilli crab around. Service levels depend on how busy it is and you may or may not like the busy streetside setting. Prices are reasonable compared to other places

btw, its not 25bucks per kilo, its 40bucks. which is cheap for some people. dont expect things to be so cheap here, especially in singapore. there is no way you'll paying 5bucks for crab, even in cambodia, a skinny river crab cost 10bucks. expect to pay around 100sdg for 2 crabs. try their oyster which is great as well. the only thing I wasnt happy was they dont give the complimentary dessert anymore, and it comes with 2dollars in the menu now. which is ok. no sign board seafood is a must in singapore. =

My first time in SIngapore I order $20 shrimp and ask for a side. Small whote pepper crab and at the end get a $130 bill including the rice (I am only one person and could have never eaten it all) and .40 wet wipe. What a ripoff!?! I thought Singapore was a tourist friendly town not one that tries to rip you off left and right. I guess I learned my lesson!

Food was very average and I wouldn't have bothered giving a review if it hadn't been for the fact that we were CHARGED for tap water and CHARGED for those wet serviette things they give you after you've eaten (no paper ones supplied).The icing on the cake is the fact that when I went to the ladies toilet there was no toilet paper in either of the two cubicles. I assume I would have been expected to pay for that too.Would't recommend this place - much better to be had

Im not a big fans of crab, especially chilly crab in Singapore. I was with my mom and my sister, when my sister keep on talking about this place, and drag us to go there. and we went.I was so shock to see, all the workers is from china, but the way they service is looks like 5 star chinese restaurant. they wear suits, and they look for your table. its amazing since its located around the red light district area. so I dont expect it to be well.the portion is too big too be true, I also ordered oyster, and they sell canadian oyster, so its also huge, and it cost around 8 bucks I think. the crab cost 40 bucks. which is cheap. we spent 100bucks and its a good experience. Im going back there again, when im going to singaporeI went to their branches at other place, and it doesnt taste good, worst its more expensive. they also have branch at jakarta, which is worst and sad. so Im suggesting, just go to the geylang branch, dont go anywhere else

This is the only No Signboard I dig ...
The best is the white pepper crab...

No Signboard on the East Coat Seafood Centre, Singapore, doesn't have fancy tablecloths or over-the-top decor but it does have great service and with best white pepper crab ever tasted. The chilli crab is also fantastic but nothing we chose from the menu disappointed.

Pepper/chilli crab, herbal prawns, mee goreng

Trying Singapore Chili Crab was high on my priority list during a recent visit; I was not disapointed! Clearly only for those who like their food spicy, and those willing to splurge for the cost, the Chili Crab at No Signboard was worth making the trek out to the Geylang area. Service was very attentive, and the great food more than makes up for a relative lack of atmosphere

Ate here at the recommendation of the hotel staff in the Conrad Sentennial where we stayed.It was billed as a good, reasonable priced, restaurant where the locals eat.It was indeed very busy and we had to reserve a table for later in the evening and go for an interim beer.The food was OK but wasn't great. The saving grace for the place was supposed to be the price however quite a number of dishes are marked as market price which turned out to be a euphemism for very expensive for the standard of food / service. the final bill of Â£120 for two with a pitcher of Tiger beer was a lot even for Singapore.In the end we enjoyed the experience until we saw the bill at which point we felt we could have got much better

White pepper crab is nicer compare to its chilli crab. Not my 1st choice for crab eating session
1
First of all: they serve shark fins without any idea of its origin - the same goes for the crabs. and if you aks them, they don´t give a s***. So any environmentally aware and ethically oriented traveller should definitely avoid the place.For all the food they serve: it´s overprizedStaff is unorganised and hectic, don´t expect anything for your mone
