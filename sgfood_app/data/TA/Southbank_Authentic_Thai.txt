This was a visit after a long lapse. We note that prices have gone up, probably because of the increase in rents along the Boat Quay area. We were a large group of 14 and we were accommodated on 2 different tables.We ordered our food, which arrived quickly. Some general comments: the kailan was over-cooked and the chilli prawn, well, avoid this if you can. The rest of the dishes we ordered were passable: kangkong, red curry beef, chicken basil, Thai curry chicken, etc. only the sweet & sour fish was really worth a mention. Overall, the food is not fantastic for the price we paid, especially along the stretch of Boat Quay that is filled with eateries. We heard that this restaurant will be moving out of Boat Quay soon. Hopefully, the quality will improve after the move

You cant miss this joint as you amble along boat quay trying to sort out your mind amidst myriad choices.On a friday night (presumably when boat quay is at it's busiest), we walked in here. Reasons? It seemed less crowded (possibly because it comes across more as a restaurant than a bar), better lit (good for those who like to see what they are eating !) and hosts who beckon you from the street. Another but strong reason was that their menu has a complete page dedicated for vegetarian food :)While one of the male waiters was pushy and impatient, another female waiter made up with a sweet smile and accommodating way. They do have a detailed beverage menu, a full booklet menu card and a large card with pictures of what you ordered for looks like. This really helps the uninitiated and the unsure !We ordered for tom yam soup which was delicious. They were particularly helpful in accommodating our request for less or no spicy items. The Mango salad was delicious as was the fried broccoli.There is a very fair selection for vegetarians and they are very reassuring for those not wanting mushrooms/chillies/egg etc. The main course was good but i would not rate it excellent and i agree somewhere with another reviewer that there is a chinese touch in their thai dishes. Having said that i would not blame them as an overwhelming majority of their patrons could be chinese and over time dishes would evolve as per their taste.I found their service quite fast. Alarmingly fast at times. Do not order the main course along with the starters and drinks here. It will invariable be served too quickly leaving you very little breathing space.Like all boat quay restaurants they are expensive. However prices are at par with other boat quay restaurants.So the final verdict is nice thai place to eat if you are in boat quay. Definitely not a good daily place for office goers in Raffles. My favorite thai place near equity plaza at raffles place serves better stuff at a tenth of the cost (without the ambience and the riverside though). If you are looking for exclusive thai there are better places in singapore at the same or better prices

We did a lot of research before settling on this restaurant. It was our last night in Singapore and we wanted Chilli Crab in a nice setting. We wanted to leave on a high point. Boat Quay is notorious for overpriced tourist traps.There are scare stories all over the Internet. Things like: patrons pointing out the crab in the tank that you'll have, giving you a price for it, then actually serving you one that's smaller and charging you more; trying to entice you in with offers of free drinks or free courses which never transpire; charging for napkins or nuts you never ordered.We did a recky in the morning, wandering along the quay. We met Mr Jasper Tan outside his restaurant and chatted about crab. We liked him. We liked his menu. We liked the view. So we booked a table for that evening. But then we saw lots of other nice looking restaurants, with nice people offering us all sorts of nice things. So, confused, back at the hotel we looked on-line and read a whole range of reviews for restaurants along Boat Quay. As luck would have it, the Southbank Authentic Thai came out the best. Yay.Mr Tan had saved us a lovely table right over the water. We started with steaming bowls of Tom Yum and Chicken Coconut soup. Both were hot, fragrant and really delicious. We nibbled on a few charcoaled satay sticks with spicy, sticky peanut sauce.Then it was the Chilli Crab. Mr Tan had brought out the crab for us to see in its raw state, having ascertained how much we wanted to pay. It was writhing and enormous. We were tooled up and bibbed up. The (same) beast arrived on the plate with a flourish and Mr Tan insisted we took a photo. There was a mountain of crab in a rich, red, spicy sauce. By the end of the meal we were covered, all decorum blown in our efforts to extract every last shred of meat from the shell. Who needs Chanel Rouge Noir, when you've got chilli sauce smeared all over your face.We'd had a glass of Prosecco as we looked at the menu and a bottle of cold, crisp white wine to go with the crab. It wasn't expensive.With illuminated Singapore sparkling on the water, the brightly lit Bumboats bobbing by, the Marina Bay lasers flashing green above us, the balmy air - it was memorable and romantic and spicy and everything we could have wanted for our final evening here. The bill came to around €180, which we were very happy with given what we'd eaten and drunk. So don't be drawn in and tempted astray by free drinks and "specially for you's". Just head straight here and get messy with some crab. Mr Tan's your Man

The first thing we always do after arriving in Singapore and settling down in our hotel, is a saunter along Boat Quay. As we were still recovering from the long haul trip we let us pull into the South Bank Authentic Thai Restaurant by the barker for an early dinner. As siting at the Singapore river at Boat Quay is one thing we always like to do when in Singapore, we were not unhappy trying a different restaurant. We ended up content, sitting at a table at the waterfront with a large Tiger beer and a surprisingly tasty and well seasoned black pepper beef with steamed rice. A piece of advice, which holds true for all Boat Quay restaurants: Always negotiate beforehand about discounts, happy hours, portion size and price. Otherwise the value for money leaves much to desired. But this restaurant is to be recommended, moreover because in this restaurant is no racket with bowls of peanuts and towelettes, which appear on the bill later, as in similar restaurants at Boat Quay

We went to this restaurant because the previous reviews were good. I REALLY struggle to understand how this could happen if these reviews are genuine. For all intents and purposes this appears to be a Chinese restaurant that trys to pass off cooking "Authentic" Thai....However, this is anything but that. We ordered several dishes and all were extremely salty and produce quality was substandard. Food was promptly served and service was friendly however. I would strongly recommend visiting Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill if you're looking for good thai food

I wandered along Boat Quay and chose 'Authentic Thai' at random. The tables aren't particularly pretty, but it has a great view of the water and the food was tasty. I had boneless roasted honey chicken and rice and it was tasty. Throw in a cold Tiger beer and it was a decent lunch - pricey for Thai at $30 (including the beer), but this is boat quay after all. Overall experience was good when you factor in views and food

Walking around Boat Quay looking for something to eat and not wanting to walk that far after a day’s work, Authentic Thai Restaurant is one of the first restaurants after you pass Harry’s and the Tapas bar. The location is great for people watching and your experience will be topped off with some very fine Thai food. If you like satay, you have to try the satay platter for two, which has lamb, chicken and beef, so there is something for everyone. And the satay sauce is quite good. The Phad Thai is good as well as the Red Curry Chicken. The portions are healthy and there is a nice selection of wines. The service is attentive and the prices are very acceptable. The next time I go, I will check out their spicy crab
