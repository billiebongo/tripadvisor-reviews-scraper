The signature dish is hitsumabushi, unagi rice with 3 different ways of eating. Quality is comparable to Man Man restaurant. Saw Japanese servers in the restaurant.

Touted to be as good as Man Man but personally I feel not quite there yet. The eel quality is ok and grilled to good standard but I would say it’s not near Man Man Unagi standards.

Delicious fresh eel which is nicely grilled.
The signature set allows you to try it 3 different ways, and the eel is chopped.
There is another set in which you can eat the whole eel.
Save some space for dessert, which is a parfait.

Tried this place as was recommended by Lady Iron chef. We had the special set Himamitsu. Eels are fresh and grilled on site. Although it was nice, I actually preferred man man more. We did not have to queue for our Tuesday lunch.

Brought my family for the well published Unagi dinner. Spent the whole morning trying to get thru to their phone line for a table. Gave up we went 15mins before the evening operating hrs. A line was already formed. Managed to get a table from a rather bad attitude staff who turn out to be the Supervior or manager of the place. She doesn’t even welcome U but gave U the attitude as if we need to beg for table! Placed our order plus a bottle of Sake n waited patiently for their signature dish. Waiting time wasn’t that bad and I must agreed we did enjoyed our meal very much if not because of the rude attitude supervisor. The waitresses were pretty inexperience and most time they couldn’t really answered well when patrons asked them questions. The area that we were allocated were pretty dark so when I requested the waitress if she could help to turn on the lighting for our area, she can’t even do such simple task. Instead she went over to that rude supervisor n after talking to her, the waitress avoided our table. It was not a peaceful meal as the moment U about to finish yr meal, waitress kept coming over to wanting to clear yr tray etc. We ended up rushed thru our food and didn’t even feel good to finish up our bottle of sake. Closed my bill and requested to pack my balance bottle of sake. While paying my bill over at the counter, I casually mentioned to that rude supervisor that it was impossible to get thru to their phone line. She replied me very rudely that they don’t have time to answer calls! When I told her that our sitting area was abit dark she told me very rudely that ‘nobody say that, U’re the only one to say that!’ I was shocked at how rude n unprofessional her attitude is. She closed my bill and moved off to attend to the waiting line! Wow for that short 43mins we were there, we spent nearly $300 with bad attitude from this supervisor! Food to be fair were ok but not great like what we read. We definitely had better unagi elsewhere with much better n professional service! Will we come back again? With such bad attitude? Definitely NO

I ordered the hitsumabushi eel rice and the food was good but my Brother had to wait for about an hour Long just to get his wagyu rare beef rice despite many reminders. I would recommend this place but if you are not ordering the eel be prepared to wait a long time for your food

Just tried this with a friend. Nice layout and the ventilation is good so your clothes don't smell of grilled food. We tried their special - Nagoya style eel. The taste is different from Man Man but it was tasty, less salty. The eel was not as fat but it was well grilled.Overall I can recommend this place.

That's the new house for unagi, which claimed to brought the Japanese eel and house-recipe to Singapore. I had ordered the medium-sized signature eel don. My food would be wonderful if the eel was not over burnt (as reflected in the photo). Otherwise, it would taste so much better. Now, it was an average. Seems like the restaurant was quite occupied. If no reservation was made, most walk-ins would be seated at the large table with the tree. Frankly, a bit expensive for the quality of my set at that night. One last thing, not all servers were attentive but the lady receiving me was helpful

I was here when the doors were open at 6pm on a weekday. Restaurant is more spacious than Man-Man, and does not have steep stairs or small squishly spaces to navigate through (this is good for the elderly). Did not have a reservation, so was shown to the communal table. Service was good, staff friendly. Compared to Man-Man, the eel here is not as sweet (the tare sauce used is not as sweet), the Eel has a more grilled, smokey flavour. Not as generous with the sauce over the rice. Pickles were nice. Dashi was not as strong. In summary, I would prefer this eel to be eaten with the condiments and shichimi, while the Man-Man version of ochazuke tastes better to me. Had the matcha parfait, nothing to shout about. Not really worth the $12 to me.I would come again, if I had a craving, but I would also want to make a trip to Man-Man
