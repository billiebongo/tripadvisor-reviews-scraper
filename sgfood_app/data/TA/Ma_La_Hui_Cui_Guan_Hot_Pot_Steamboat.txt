Try the hotpot. The waiters were really good in explaining what they had and how to order. I really enjoyed the food, it was really tasty. They are open late.

We visited this place on a whim, as we were looking for somewhere to satisfy our cravings for deliciously spicy food at unreasonably late hours. It was amazing, and has changed our life. We can never be happy with poor quality szechuan again.

The price is affordable. Individual hotpot which you choose 2 different kinds of soup base. Good variety of fresh food to choose from. Good ambience with polite service staff.

Visited twice this month. Approximately S$30/- each Pax. Restaurant is clean, food is fresh and best of all is their cooking can be done via individual mini pots.

The food portion served was quite generous but the soup base was disappointing and salty. End up drank a lot of water. Not all food ordered was served.

As an American, living in Singapore for now 5 plus yesterday my friends and I visited Ma La Hui Cui Guan. They had been raving about it for several month..So, yesterday we went there in the early afternoon. Having been formerly often disappointed by previous steamboat outings...I was skeptical, even though my European friends are fussy foodies...The very courteous and kind waiter briefed us on the tablet operation for ordering. First, this is the first steamboat I have experienced with individual choice of two broths from a choice of six. The it pick as much as you think you can eat of teh many vegetable, meat, chicken and seafood choices...ALL VERY FRESH and when cooked in the broth of your choice ...wonderful taste sensations. As our plates emptied if we chose more meat ...or vegetable the waiter was quick to bring it to the table. The three of us kept marveling at how great the food and service was...This steamboat restaurant stands to be one of the best restaurant experiences taste profiles coupled with great service...I am looking forward to many more positive experiences there..

That's actually the best Chinese food I had in Singapore. I discovered it after over a year of living next door and I was amazed by the food they serve here. You can get an individual pot of two broths and those are simply delicious! Every food that comes is super fresh and tasty- after letting it boil on the broth for a while you simply can't stop eating. Sometimes I wish I could have an additional stomach to fit everything in! Price is fixed- 25 dollars for all you can eat. Be prepared to spend here at least 2 hours:) it's an absolute pleasure to eat here!!

If u are looking for mala 麻辣 hotpot, this place serves it more spicy than numbing. Buffet is $25 and there is 10% service charge but seemingly no GST (7%). Buffet price does not include the price of drinks. They do serve ice water if you request for it. The quality of food is not bad really. I am just somewhat disappointed by their mala soup base. They do have a good selection of ingredients for you to create your own dip. For my friends and I, we appreciate having our own individual pots.

Buffet Hotpot/Steamboat with good selection of food items. Every diner has their own hotpot and is able to choose their own soup-base. There are 6 different types of sour-bases for you to choose from. Open sauces table for your pick & mix style for sauce favours. At lesser than $30/- per head during dinner, this is really value for money

The food at this Chinese restaurant is one of the best I've ever had. The taste is authentic from the Chong Qing province. Would strongly recommend the Boiled Fish in Spicy Sichuan Pepper, Chong Qing spicy diced chicken, Hui Guo Beef, Laogama Beef, Crispy Cereal Prawn and Black Fungus in pickled chilli. Nothing beats the Hui Guo Beef
