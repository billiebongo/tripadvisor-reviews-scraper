This small restaurant offer some very good and well presented Arabic food. The location is not great, in the hall of a shopping mall, and the service is very basic, but the food is great and affordable. Reservation recommended.

As an avid admirer of middle eastern and Arabic food, this was one of the best meals I have ever had.
The blend of spices and with meat cooked to perfection, a very memorable meal at a bargain price

This evening, my family celebrated my my wife’s birthday at Pistachios Grill. We had a wonderful dinner, enjoying the family time and food served. As usual, we started the meal with black mussels with creamy garlic sauce. Based on the recommendation by Agnes, we decided to give the lamb shoulder a try for the first time. It was a wonderful choice! The lamb was very well-marinated, and pieces of meats could literally be pulled off its bone. The basmati rice mixed with the spices made it even tastier.Chef Khaled personally prepared an Egyptian dessert, ‘Fetter’, for my wife. According to Chef Khaled, it is a dessert for a special occasion. It was a wonderful dessert treat for my birthday girl! It made the birthday celebration really special and unique for us.

Let's get one thing straight from the start - the location of Pistachio Grill isn't the best. Its in a shopping mall on the ground floor. If you want ambience and a view, this place perhaps isn't for you. In fact, my husband apologised when we got here! However, he really needn't have bothered - the food is fantastic and the service is friendly and very quick. We had the mixed grill and the stuffed prawns which were both excellent. Possibly slightly on the overpriced side (given it's in a shopping mall) but a delicious dinner nonetheless. It was also lovely to meet the chef.... Well worth a visit and many thanks

We came here after reading reviews, and were surprised that the restaurant is inside a mall, but we were amazed at how great the food is and the excellent service. Mr Khaled the chef came over and made sure that the food was to our liking. Everything was very tasty starting from the chicken soup to the mixed grill

I visited this restaurant with my Wife & Daughter. Being vegetarian, we ordered Turkish Pizza, Pita Bread & Soup. The food was very nice. The spread of veg dishes is good. We loved talking to the owner (Ms. Agnes) who first gave us recommendation on what should we order and later promptly came to check if food is good and anything she can do. We loved this place. Highly recommended

Balestier Road in Sinaporw is known for its budget hotels and cheap good eating places to experience Singaporean cuisine.When you have your fill of local food, and hankering for some Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food, there is Pistacchio Grill . Great food, great value for money. Licated at the ground floor of Zhongshan Mall.Highly recommended

There is a saying DON'T EVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. Pistachio at Zongshan mall is such an experience. We arrived with our wine, bottle opener and glasses - Pistachio does not have an alcohol license - and when we discovered that the restaurant is in the middle of the mall fully exposed to the buzzing walkabout of men, women and children - we got very skeptical.We gave it a shot and sat down - the four of us - hungry over-sized men on a mission for a culinary carnivore experience.Khaled, the owner of this restaurant, came over and suggested we try the pita bread, baba ghannoush and hummus to start with followed by Angus beef ribs for starters and a robust Tomahawk steak for mains.WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW - all I can say - what an amazing treat. The pita bread cooked at 600 degrees C to make it fluffy - and the garnish - absolutely terrific and set the tone for what was coming. The Angus beef ribs and the saffron rice an explosion in taste - and the Tomahawk steak cooked to perfection over a total of a mere 18 minutes - Khaled - you have totally won us over. We even tried and shared all four desserts on the menu - and by now we were ready to be carried out of the restaurant - what an experience - in the middle of the Zongshan mall. Khaled with his Egyptian roots and experience from the Shangri-la - and his wonderful Singaporean wife Agnes - are on to something big in the restaurant scene in Singapore - and we will be there to support this most amazing story - and food - we simply do not care about the cover of the book - you forget the surroundings when given such an exceptional culinary experience. Thank you Khaled and Agnes for your wonderful hospitality

From the face of it this looks like a food court type restaurant. But we went as the number of reviews were very good. We orders the salad, babagnush and the mixed grill. The first two were ok, but the grill was excellent. The presentation was very different from the usual Mediterranean restaurants. The spices were just right. The meat was succulent and well marinated. Excellent value for money. The chef and owner Khalid came over and asked about the food. Also shared recipes. They don’t serve alcohol. But allow BYOB.

Visited after hearing good things about this place. It’s hard to find good Middle Eastern cuisine in Singapore - personally I don’t much care for the outlets in the Arab St area as I find them overpriced and the food somewhat lacking in authenticity. So we decided to try Pistachio Grill.Atmosphere: not the most conducive - the restaurant is actually situated in the (rather small) atrium of Zhongshan Mall, which means mall-goers are pretty much walking all around you as you dine. Seating is a bit cramped and it can be a bit loud as well. Service: Decent enough. You have to place your own order at the counter and pay upon ordering. Food is brought to the table by the waitstaff, though. I may be mistaken but I think they charge for water (if I remember rightly...) Food: Our family of four ordered the hummus with meat, a side of pita bread, a mixed grill, as well as an off-menu special which I was really excited to try since I’d seen awesome photos of it — the beef rib. We requested for the rice in the mixed grill to be substituted with salad instead, as the beef rib came with a large portion of rice. However, the service staff informed us that they couldn’t do that, and it would only be possible to reduce the serving of rice and add more salad. Hummus with meat: Legit! Creamy with great mouthfeel and ample tahini flavour. However, we did expect more meat for the price. I also was expecting meat in the form of shawarma (in sliced form), but the meat that arrived looked more like mince instead. Not a dealbreaker though. Pita: the pita was quite a showstopper when it was served, as it was about the length of a child’s arm. It was served warm and was sufficiently fluffy so no complaints all around. Mixed grill: the meat was served on dangling skewers, with a bed of rice/salad beneath. The meat was capable enough — definitely not the best I’ve had — some of the chunks were slightly dried out. While the presentation of the dish was noteworthy, it also cluttered up the table and obstructed (somewhat) our views of each other due to the nature of the hanging skewers. I don’t think I would opt for this dish again, especially since the staff couldn’t accommodate our request of substituting all the rice for salad. Off-menu special (beef rib): this spectacular bone-in hunk of meat was simply amazing. It was our favourite dish of the night! The meat slid off the bone with hardly any coaxing from our forks, much less our knives. It was a large rib and I dare say a great dish to be shared among 2-3 people (although I could’ve easily finished it by myself as it was so delicious). Tender and flavourful, the juices of the beef rib had also seeped into the briyani-style rice beneath. The rice was an amazing accompaniment to the rib. It looked similar to the rice that had been served along with the mixed grill, but tasted heaps better probably because it was infused with beefy juicy goodness. Unfortunately I didn’t take any photos of this meal but it’s good to see that other diners have dutifully snapped photos of all the dishes I mentioned above. I’ll definitely return (if only for the beef rib) — I’ll skip the mixed grill and maybe get just the plain hummus — but I’m also looking forward to trying other items on the menu
5
As usual amazing food! You would be crazy if you don’t take the pita bread with a babaganoush (don’t know the spelling) or hummus as a starter!
5
Last dinner of our 3 week trip. What a find a few metres from where we were staying. We really enjoyed our meal and service was great. We went for the shared mixed grills and couscous Royale. Fantastic
3
First time to this restaurant,food not really bad.Service was good from Chef and recommended some dish.Too much for 2 person,unable to finish all.
5
For mediterranean food you will never beat this place. It’s in a mall which is super odd and not a great mall but there packed all the time and two seatings and best for sure make Reservation. A must must and even if yuh need to drive far its the best I have ever had and I have eaten at allot of these type restaurants while here in Singapore we ate there twice it’s so good.
5
Went there with a couple of friends for dinner. The beef ribs and pita bread were mind blowing. Not only was the food really flavourful, it was really healthy. Highly recommended!
3
The Hummus and Pistachio Salad were great, the Garlic Cheese Pita Bread - no hint of garlic. It was our first attempt on the Fried Kibbeh and we don't like it because the beef had little flavor, dry and no texture. The best dish was the Pistachio Mix Grill, the chicken kebab and Adana kebab were tender, juicy and flavorful. A pity that the lamb chops were a little overcooked
5
This is our 4th visit and will keep coming back. We are working through the menu with each visit. So far 9/10 of the dishes are a hit. The repeat orders, we have had, are always consistent. Our staples continue to be the pita bread, hummus, and mussels. We recommend it to all our friends.
5
I am a fan of Pistachio and try to come to the restaurant at least once every one to two months. Yesterday was again an awesome dining experience with the beef rib as the main dish. We also had the baba ghanoush with pita bread and the Moroccan mint tea. Chef Khaled also prepared some tasty tzatziki and flamed some saganaki using authentic kasseri cheese.We love this place and we love Chef Khaled and Agnes for their warm hospitality
5
The Restaurant is located in a mall, real estate is super expensive in Singapore. Therefore, seating is a little unconventional but definitely worth the visit. You sit down look at the menu and order at the counter. But once the food arrives it’s a food experience like no other. Best tomato soup and creamy hummus. All the dishes we ordered were exceptional delicious and the service was friendly and helpful. If they are not too busy which is rare the chef and owner comes out himself. Very friendly and you can tell he cooks from his heart. Would go back in a heart beat.
2
First of all the food here is great, however they just can’t keep up with the capacity and the service is well below par as a result.Made a phone order, turned up 20 mins later to collect and it just “wasn’t made”, no excuse given, no apology, nothing! Had to wait another 20 mins for it...Here’s an idea don’t offer takeaway and accept an order if you can’t deliver on it.This is not the first time we have had issues with this place, patience is running very thin...
5
Good and hearty food for groups. Service is personal and we welcome every food with sounds of "wows" and "oohs" round the table. We cleared all the food ... Opps
4
I have visited Pistachio Grill 3 times this year with different groups of friends. The food quality is very good and service friendly. Worth a visit!
Suggestion: to have a prominent signage so that more people can enjoy your restaurant...
5
was really hungry after a long days work and this place satisfied me .,a must visit great ambience and view
4
We had a magnificent meal at Pistachio Grill. Fantastic service and food. Was quite expensive but would do it again.
4
Pro - The hummus and pita bread was delicious and also the shish taouk with fluffy saffron rice. Would love to try some other dishes.Cons - Service and also reservation.Maybe if you can make more slots timing for reservation would be great.For service, just ensure all put a good smile and attend to the guest.But I will still come back for the good food you served and close one eye for the service
3
Our first visit was for dinner. We liked the grills - chicken, beef, lamb. The pita bread was great too.Our second visit was for dinner. Again, the food was good. There was just one issue with the service. When food was served, the waiter simply put it on the table and quickly turned away without saying what had been served. That left us having to figure out which one of us was it for
5
Do not expect soft lights and a romantic ambiance but do expect to be blown away by the quality of their food. Khaled is a Chef extraordinaire. He doesn't just cook. He creates and curates. With passion. His eyes light up when he talks about his meat which he selects personally and declares proudly, " when your quality is top notch, the only seasoning required is salt and pepper". As verified by the fall-off-the-bone slow braised beef ribs, the tomahawk Angus, and his mixed grill. And the flat bread, served fresh from the oven, puffed up and piping hot, to be eagerly torn apart for dipping into perfectly seasoned hummus or babaganoush and a host of other mezze beginnings. A middle eastern food experience that begs to be repeated over and over
5
The grilled beef and lamb are simply awesome and taste fantastic. The pita bread and rice are very good too. Considering the quality of the food, the price is reasonable and affordable. The chef did an excellent job. Overall, it is one of the best that I have tried so far and been there quite a few times and each time I was not disappointed.The service is good and staff friendly
4
My friends and i had a table reserved for dinner, to be honest i was excited to try the food here after reading so much on tripadvisor. We were greeted by the service staff and shown our table, the service staff were friendly and polite. After placing our orders at the counter, we were advised to select one of specials that wasn't on the menu. Boy o boy it did not disappoint (More on this below) We started our meal with Pita bread and hummus dip, the bread was nice and hot. The hummus was not diluted and full of flavour. Thereafter, our Pistachio mixed grill and the 200 day angus beef with rice (Special of the day) was served. The mixed grill consisted of adana kebabs, chicken kebab and lamb chops served with a side of hot saffron rice. I believe this is one of the popular dishes here, and it proved why. The meats tasted fresh, succulent and well flavoured. For a moment, you are transported to the middle east as such flavours are a rare find in our island. Next we began feasting on the 200 day angus beef with rice. The tender aged beef slides off the bone with ease, with each piece of the meat there was juicy goodness.Good meat doesn't require you to season it too much but requires skill in cooking it just right, this is exactly what the chef has brilliantly done. The meat was cooked to perfection, the pairing of the meat with the fragrant rice was a clear win for the restaurant. Overall our trip to Pistachio grill was pleasant, the greatness is in its food rather than the ambiance and setting. We will definitely be dining again ! Top Tips:1) Make a reservation at least a week in advance if dining on the weekends.2) Try and request for a table inside the restaurant, we were seated towards the front and it was slightly cramped with guest and staff moving on both sides of our tables.3) If available try the 200 day Aged angus beef on rice.4) If dining with children, i'd recommend the cream sauce pizza and the margherita pizza
5
This place will NOT disappoint you and your friends. Unassuming and in the corner of Level 1, nobody would suspect this restaurant will appeal to the highest of your senses. Simply Satisfying and you can feel the love sown in the food. Passion of Chef Khaled and Agnes are just felt all about the restaurant and the quality of food being served. Highly strongly recommended
4
Very good. We were there at 6pm and by 8pm it was full on a Monday night.
The mixed meat grill is good. Enjoyed the pita bread and the mussels too. Will return.
5
Honest-to-goodness, delicious food. The beef ribs and the mussels were to die for. Chef Khaled was warm and passionate about his food. Highly recommended!
5
The chef and waitress were very welcoming and friendly. Even though the restaurant is small, their menu is extensive and you leave with a full stomach and heart.
The chef offered us free dessert, which was lovely as well.
Definitely worth the trip!
5
On the advise of a good friend, a group of 6 of us decided to have a steak dinner at ZhongShan mall (hardly the place one would expect, atleast what was claimed, to be the best steak on Singapore). Suffice to say, it even surpassed my high expectations of the quality and taste of food i have not experienced in Singapore, ever!The Tomahawk's (pre ordered) are by ar one of the best seared and cooked steaks in Singapore.. BUt the piece de resistance was the Beef RIbs with Saffron rice - what a bland and smash of flavors. The cherry on the topping was ofcourse Chef Khaled himself, who is originally from Egypt and has spend 11 years with the Four Seasons and 5 years with Shangri-La Singapore. What a humble personaltiy, who went around every table to ask and chat about the guests experience. With it's focus on fresh ingredients over fancy pdinnerware, this establishment is going to go places
5
Love the food. Wonderful flavors, fresh ingredients, and food made with heart and soul. A great place for a healthy good lunch or dinner. Dishes we tried included the kebabs, pita bread and hummus, all finely made from scratch. Rice was low glycemic index basmati, very fluffy. Dessert was nonetheless low sugar too, well done and looking forward to return to try other items on the menu!! Thanks for a fantastic gastronomic experience.
5
I really did not want to share or rave about Pistachio but the chef's culinary skill is superb and his wife managing the hospitality aspect is simply lovely! Ambience wise .... not great as anyone walking around the mall couod you see chomping on your Angus ribs .... yummy to the max! The fish dish is unforgettable. The resto is always so packed that I have ever done takeaway and the food is still so good! Have hosted dinner parties at home with the takeaways from pistachio and none had said any thing not good about the food! Value for money, good service with really lovely Agnes and another lady! That personal touch at this non-pretentious resto with good quality food is a must try and I believe you will be back for more. My friends and family agreed thus far and have visited too
5
What can I say? The food is simply amazing, the chef/owner is very friendly and charismatic, and he made sure that we were comfortable and enjoyed our food. 100% will recommend and I will definitely visit again.The restaurant is tucked in a corner of Zhongshan Mall, which is a tiny 2-storied mall along Balestier Road. Three of us went on a quiet Tuesday at around 6.45pm, and even though the mall itself was pretty empty, the restaurant was already fully booked by then. We didn't make any reservations beforehand, so we had to sit at another table which belonged to an ice-cream shop (seems like Pistachio and that shop has some agreement on this). We had to purchase an item each from that ice-cream shop in order to sit there, which we did.Having never been to Pistachio before, we asked the chef/owner (I think his name was Khaled) for recommendations. For the three of us, he recommended 2 dips (one hummus and one made of eggplant) with pita bread, a mixed grill (chicken, lamb, beef) and a Turkish pizza. I was apprehensive about the lamb as I am v sensitive to the gamey taste and odor, but Khaled assured that their lamb does not have that taste. So we went ahead with his selection.The pita bread was served very quickly, and pipping hot. I absolutely recommend it, I could smell the pita fragrance from afar and I couldn't wait to dig in. It was as delicious as it smelled. The dips also tasted really fresh, and I especially liked the spicy tangy taste of the eggplant dip. I would say that one dip was more than enough for one serving of pita bread, but I was glad that I got to try both dips.The Turkish pizza was next and it was HEAVENLY! I think it was fresh beef patties and tomatoes on cheese and bread, I couldn't remember because I just wolfed it down. The combination was soooo good. The crust was also very fragrant, and I ate it together with the dips. Highly recommend!!Next up was the mixed grill with chicken and beef (Adana) kebab, and 2 lamb chops. True to Khaled's words, the lamb did not have a strong odor. It was really deliciously marinated and tasty on the first bite, but I found that the more I chew, the stronger the gamey taste, I guess as it filled my mouth. Like I said before, I am VERY sensitive to the odor, but this I could take. What I found really thoughtful was that they actually gave us a small serving of garlic paste, which I took together with lamb. It eliminated the odor and actually complemented the taste of the meat really well. The beef and chicken were delicious too, and went well with the serving of saffron rice, but I think I might have liked the lamb the most, if not for the mild odor when I chewed. My other 2 friends preferred the chicken and beef respectively, so I guess to each their own.At this point, Khaled checked in with us twice to make sure we were enjoying our meal, which was really nice and thoughtful of him. We were impressed with his recommendations and the amount of food was just right for the 3 of us. At the end of the meal, he even brought us desserts on the house! What a pleasant surprise! It was Panna Cotta with fresh berries, and it had a subtle coffee taste. Super delicious and a sweet end to a fantastic meal.It's just a pity that such a gem is not in a more accessible area. Although there is a bus stop right outside Zhongshan Mall, it's not very close to train stations (nearest is Toa Payoh station, 17 mins walk or 10 mins bus).I would still visit again of course, I would like to try their fish main course dish (another table had it and it looked so delicious). Khaled wanted to recommend that to us but he thought that we wouldn't have been able to finish so much food so he got us the Turkish pizza instead. I would also like to try their lunch menu, which is cheaper, and has staple Middle Eastern dishes like Shawarma and Falafel.Pistachio is definitely worth making the trip down! I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for authentic and delicious Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food

My first visit to Pistachio was based on word and mouth recommendations with no reference to TripAdvisor; my wife and I were so impressed; the second visit was made as an after meeting dinner for my Board Members during a Board Meeting in Singapore; the unanimous verdict of my colleagues all foodies to a man; matched our initial verdict of outstanding; and the best Middle Eastern food I (or they) have had anywhere. Having now read TripAdvisor reviews it seems that all reviewers have had the same fantastic culinary experience. Must haves when you visit is the Pita Bread which is quite simply the best; Tomahawks and mixed grill to die for as well as kebabs salads and hummus. The entire experience was enhanced by the irrepressibly Ingit providing exemplary service and whose knowledge of the menu and ability to read what we would appreciate from that menu created by the magic of Chef Khaled Elelimi, made both visits (so far) a perfect experience. Finally, although mentioned in other reviews; I would like to underwrite the opinion expressed by others of the very reasonable pricing
5
We had the Garlic Cheese Pita Bread and Pistachio Mix Grill for Two, which were both excellent.The chef, Khaled Elelimi, was really friendly and came by our table to ask about our dining experience. He even offered a small pita and dessert as complimentary dishes, for which we were very grateful. He mentioned that he is from Egypt and worked at Shangri-la for 6 plus years before starting his own business at Pistachio Grill. No wonder the food was amazing! A must try
5
It's very simple.This place had amazing food, and miraculously (especially for Singapore) wasn't overpriced whatsoever. When I go to Middle Eastern restaurants, I judge by their food based on the quality of their pita, their hummus, and their meat. The pita was fresh, large and perfect to share for 3/4 people. Their hummus was excellent, and the meat was well-spiced and perfectly cooked. I'm a student, and this would be the perfect place for any student to treat himself/herself and a few friends (or a date). Unlike so many restaurants in Singapore, the food/experience I received was more than worth my money (this is coming from someone who grew up in the USA, where everything but massages is far cheaper than in Singapore).Moreover, the service was excellent. Our waiter offered great advice when ordering, clearly cared about us as customers, and the food came out quickly. We were eating at the end of the lunch hour, and the chef/owner let us order from both the lunch and dinner menus, and spoke to us very enthusiastically - he was clearly very passionate about his work. He even gave each of us free desserts, which was truly just the cherry on top of an excellent restaurant experience.I went to Pistachio with my friends yesterday, and already have made plans to take my family here. I love Middle Eastern food, and this is by far the best place in Singapore (of the many that I've been to) to get it. I highly recommend this restaurant, for its food, service, and overall experience
5
Food and service was great! Chef made it a point o check with us whether we like the food. Thank you for the complimentary grilled prawns.
4
Pistachio Grill servies some of the most awesome grill in singapore. must visit. very friendly and fast service of food.
4
The mixed grill for 2 is value for money. The chicken is marinated and done up nicely. Lamb chop is very tender.
5
The mixed grill is awesome .... Awesome food, great service and very reasonable price. Can't ask for for. Loved Chef's cooking. Must go back more often.
5
Food was excellent, and the staff were awesome!
The mix grill and mussels were both excellent.
Would go back again!
5
I knew about this place for years now but never got to trying to.. Finally tried it yesterday.... And I have to say... I'm. Furious with myself for not coming here sooner!!Went there with my girlfriend to celebrate our 5th month together.. And now we might just make pistachio grill our go to place every month now..Food is fantastic to say the least! Even a simple dish like tomato soup was amazing.. I have no idea how they made it so goodEverything else from the black mussels and the grill platter for 2.. Was way above and beyond what I expected! I used to think the best middle eastern/Mediterranean food could only. Be found at Arab street... But nope.. This is by far the best middle eastern food I have ever had..We were even visited by the chef, who is Egyptian. Extremely friendly and modest man.. All round a wonderful experience.. Can definitely expect us there at least once a month
5
We always wanted to try but the place is often fully booked on weekend. We came at 11:30am last Sunday and got lucky. We started with garlic cheese pita and baba Ganoush. It was succulent. The Chef is a passionate and charming person who only use the best ingredients. We then tried the couscous. To die. The lamb chops was just perfect, the marinated chicken was so tasty, a bit spicy for young ones but fantastic for us. And the merguez were so good that I asked the Chef where he was being supplied. He actually makes them himself! The couscous costs 38 and is supposed to be for 2 but we added 3 merguez (lots of add-ons are available) and it was still too much for me, my Wife and my 8yo Son. I can’t wait to go back and try the rest of the carte. One minor comment, that’d be good not to have to prepay at the order and to be able to use credit cards. Hint: The Chef explained that they would move and expand in 6 months (still in Balestier area) so hopefully in the future it will be easier to get a table. Thank you Chef for bringing your talent to neighbourhood!!

Ring Chef Khaled Elelimi on +65n96863105 and order dishes OFF THE MENU. You need to book a table if you are dining at night. Also advisable during lunch time (they are open 7 days a week). The Michelin Star quality dish is the Fish Singary - freshest snapper you will find, cooked to perfection. They offer Prawn Singary as well. The mixed grill comprising lamb chops, skewered beef and chicken over saffron rice is for sharing and so are the delicious pita and garlic pita breads with humous and aubergine dips. Khaled is warm and accommodating and if you ring and book a table, will suggest dishes to deligh

Thanks to the great reviews, I have tried this eatery during my recent business trip to Singapore. The foods were truly amazing! I tried their lamb shank, perfectly prepared. The eatery is rather small, and patrons are expected to wait if there are big crowds.
4
Had a lovely family dinner and greatly enjoyed the variety of meats on offer. The Angus beef was "falling off the bone" tender. The Tomahawk steak is delicious and excellent for sharing with a large group. Don't skip the pita bread and hummus for a starter. The place does get busy so make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Also, I've read lots of comments about the charges for water. It's their policy made for sound reasons so just know before you go.
5
The best food we have had so far while in Singapore!! Huge servings and very reasonable prices. We were very spoilt by the amazing chef and hope to return soon!
5
Good selection of authentic middle eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Reasonable price point and freshness of food. Hearty meal and good for group gatherings as portions are well for sharing. Saffron rice done in perfection! Will be back...
5
Nice experience at Pistachio Grill! We came in as a family of 8. Requested non-spicy meal for our little girl! You may wish to ask for special recipe out of the menu and get yourself a little surprise! Awesome food! Great service! Thank you!

I visited this place for lunch with my family. We did not book in advance but was shown a seat. The price was reasonable and food was excellent. We enjoyed it very much. Then out of the blue was told they had 2 seating and we need to leave when we were barely 20 mins after our meals was served. We were not told but the staff was polite so we hurriedly finish our meal and left. Impressed with the food we tried to book a table for dinner 2 weeks later. We called from 4pm to 7pm over 20 times. The phone was engaged. I can only conclude they hang up the phone and not take calls. Why bother to list your phone numbers then. I will not risk going here and end up without a seat. Until they fix his and pick up calls. I wont be back. Would have given 5 stars otherwise.

My friend said this restaurant had a Muslim Chef, so she could eat there. Not too many tables, so make a reservation. Hummus and Turkish bread was nice. Salad was fresh but there was a bit too much dressing for my liking. Was recommended the Beef Rib (not on the menu) over pilaf. It was large enough for 3! The beef rib was baked and had some crispy edges, but was fall-off-the-bone tender. Pilaf had sultanas and was fragrant with subtle spices. Was told the Tomahawk steak is also good, if you have enough people to share! A good place to have a flavourful halal meal. Would go again
3
 Food was good. The grilled meats were tender and flavourful. Saffron rice was delicious.Service was not very proactive — we had to move the plates in and around ourselves (those dishes that came with skewers we have no issue with, but plates with bread? And leaving it at the other end of the table and expecting us to move it in was a bit much) — and service in-charge was a little sullen
5
Today will be my fourth visit to Pistachio Grill in 2 weeks. I have tried different dishes on each visit and all has been exceptional. Chef Khaled's attention to detail and the quality of ingredients used is evident. Food was beautifully prepared and the chef gave personal attention to his customers. Its a rare find in Singapore to have sensational food and wonderful service at affordable price. A hidden gem indeed!My favourite pick would be pita bread, baba ghannoush, tomato soup with roasted pistachio, black mussels with garlic cream, Angus beef rib with saffron rice and hot chocolate lava.I look forward to experiencing the rest of the dishes in the menu
5
Living a short distance away we often intend to drop in to this place on the way to the supermarket but never get round to it. We did for the first time last week and really glad we did. The beef rib here is beyond delicious, by far the best we've had. Match that with super friendly owners and this place was just awesome! As others have said it's a bit of a shame about the location but the food is top class. Cannot recommend this place enough. Thanks guys we'll see you again!

The food is indeed authentic and very good. Much better than Arab street which is overly hyped. Happy I found this little hidden gem. Since halal is important to me, it was really pleasing to find this place serves halal meat. Only downside is that the restaurant is very small and gets really busy, no time to really enjoy your friends company and conversations. This isn't a place to go to catch up with old friends and reminisce the past but more of a place to go to enjoy some delicious and authentic Arab cuisine. Note to the owners: it's time you found a bigger place. Your restaurant is always booked to capacity most days. Also please consider accepting visa and MasterCard payments. Most foreigners don't have cash on them or don't have NETS cards

We had the hummus, labneh, falafel and pita bread for staters. We liked it so we ordered more. The Moroccan tea was free flow, something they dont mention in the menu! Had the mixed grill for mains and which was good, especially the adana kebab. We had Um Ali for dessert and it was a big enough portion to be shared by three. It was delicious too. We were stuffed by the time we left the restaurant, overall very much satisfied. One thing to mention, there were some fruit flies that were buzzing around the seating area which were a bit of a nuisance. Perhaps they can bug spray the area before dinner. A shout out to the lady serving there for her recommendations

we had a very enjoyable evening at this restaurant. the food is very good, and since they do not serve alcoholic drinks, you are allowed to bring your own

Chef and Agnes of Pistachio Grill has made my Birthday a memorable one. Love the food which was fantastic, Lame was tender and tasty. Overall the food was fantastic.
4
Every food is very good & we really enjoy dinner !
But they have not big space, so it need reservation.
Prices also good value.

Spices are strong, but the meats (I've tried Lebanese Platter, Turkish Platter, Tomahawk Steak, Lamb Shoulder) are well-cooked and tender. The Lamb Shoulder tastes a little too strong for even my tastes, and I love the taste of mutton. The tomahawk steak is tender and juicy, a little on the bloodier side, and I LOVE the Turkish Platter, the beef patties are super tasty, and the rice is on the harder side, which is what I like. The chicken in the Lebanese Platter is also well-seasoned and very tasty

My wife and I visited Pistachio grill on a recent trip to Singapore. The food was absolutely phenomenal. Totally authentic Middle eastern food cooked with love. We had the pleasure of meeting the chef Khaleed. You could tell how passionate he was about his food, and it shows in the quality of the cuisine he puts on the table. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore and can't wait to go back the next time we're in town!!!

My partner and I tried booking for the second dinner sitting (1945-2200hrs) a couple of days prior and it was already full. We eventually settled for the first dinner sitting (1700-1930hrs) and had no regrets whatsoever. You would have read in the other reviews about the delectable hummus and freshly-baked pita bread, fragrant saffon rice and tender meat, and not forgetting the nectarous Um Ali - they are all absolutely true. In addition to that, portions were generous and more importantly, of the highest quality. We could genuinely feel the heart and soul that Chef Khaled has put in the prepare these dishes. We will definitely be be back for more. YUM

We went on a national holiday, luckily we made reservations - the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. We had to go up to the counter to order our food, I found this system not terribly efficient because they could only take one order at a time and some people take a while to make up their minds thereby holding up the queue. The food came pretty quickly - we ordered the hummus with a pita (yum yum yum!), and the kebab dishes - one chicken, one beef. The pita was HUGE! Fragrantly warm, we made quick work of it - tearing it apart and dipping it into the hummus. Before we finished with the hummus, our mains arrived. Served on a bed of fluffy saffron rice were tender chunks of skewered meat nicely spiced with a nice little side salad - we happily stuffed ourselves to repletion :) That was a great meal. The staff are super friendly and we saw the chef come out and greet some of their regular customers (they obviously knew to order the Tagines and other grilled stuff). This necessitates a return visit
5
Bottom line up front....my wife and I dined here for lunch and we love it! A coupe of things took us by surprise, the seating area is located in the main mall area, probably classified more as "casual dining". The other thing is that there are not that many dining tabes available, so reservations seem to me necessary. I did try calling to book a dinner reservation but no one answered the phone. I then used their website and booked a "lunch" and "dinner" appointment for the next day (to cover my bases). I was called back a couple of hours later and told they were completely booked for dinner but they had lunch times available. The food was delightful. I ordered the grilled beef and my wife ordered prawns with pasta. We also ordered hummus and a pita bread. I was shocked by the size of the pita bread. Something else that I really liked is that the orders were sinked to be served at the same time, a concept that is not always the norm in Singapore restaurants. The chef/owner came out greeted everyone and explained how he prepared some of the dishes. The prices are also very reasonable considering the quality of the food. A couple of bonuses about this restaurant is that they DO NOT charge GST, so that is a 17 percent savings and the mall (where they are located) offerers two hours of free parking. Overall a great experience that we will definitely be repeating.

Thank you Chef Khaled, Agnes and your wonderful team for the experience and excellent cuisine brought to Zhongshan Park! The friendliness of the owner and staff makes the food even more delicious! The restaurant is in cafe like style in the atrium of the mall casual ambience. The food is never disappointing and taste excellent! Must have and order for mains are - The Beef Ribs! The Tomahawk Platter! The lamb shoulder! The skewer meat! The prawns! The hummus and baba ganoush with bread! Arrive for lunch from a light breakfast in your belly and arrive for dinner from a light lunch is all I could say! Feast the high quality Mediterranean cuisine that will bring you back to Middle East and back to Pistachios! Love it and will continually dine!
5
it was our first visit to pistachios. and we already thinking for the next visits. the food are delicious , several other signature dishes not explore yet. Chef Kladeh is a very wonderful person, we are glad to have a chance to talk with him and take pic with him. food are very fresh.
4
Food was mouth watering, we had the tomahawk steak and kebabs, the meat was so tender and just fell off the bone. The owners Agnus and Khalid were so friendly and came out to speak to guests after service. Would definitely recommend
5
Love this restaurant, especially Chef and staff who made the whole dining experience such a joy! Recommended!
5
we live nearby and we pick up some take away regularly, and the quality is very consistent. Highly recommended, especially the mixed grill for 2!
5
We have been coming to this place regularly since it was opened a little more than one year ago. Food is very consistent and cooked very healthily with highest quality ingredients and material. Dips are all freshly made and pita bread is baked on order. Saffron rice and meats are all fantastic too. Chef is extremely friendly and makes us feel at home all the timw. He happens to be trained in ayurveda and food is halal-friendly too! Weekend require prior reservation. The tomahawk steak is a good choice (order 3 days in advance) for families or friends.
5
I had a fantastic dining experience here. We ordered the cheesy pita bread (delicious and garlicky!), baba ganush, Lebanese Platter (the chicken was so tender and spiced to perfection) and the lamb shank - so tender it immediately fell off the bone. Special mention to the harissa (chili pepper paste) and the saffron rice.The food is super affordable and you can get a lot for your money.  My only comment would be that the location isn't super fancy - but that is easy to overlook once you dig into your meal.Expect great service, and food cooked from the finest ingredients
5
After a short getaway in Singapore, we found out that the number one ranked city's restaurant was located right under our hotel room. As meat lovers my wife and I had to give it a try. And I have to say that the quality of the food was beyond our expectations. After two years living in south east asia we have never found meat with such quality. The prove is, we simply came back the next day. We had a chat with the owners who are both really nice and friendly persons
5
We live nearby and love to eat at pistachio. Every dish we tried is cooked to perfection, you can tell the chef expertise and passion! Even my 6 year old daughter loves to eat there and raves about the mussels in garlic sauce. Agnes is a very kind hostess looking well after her customers.The setting is casual but who cares when the food is so delicious!Thank you Agnes and Khaled for making each meal a perfect one.We will be back again and again and will definitely spread the word pistachio

I really loved the main course i ordered and my daughters loved the pizza, except the soup was not that good and nobody warned is that its spicy and children can not have i
5
I love middle eastern food. I have eaten it all over the world, including of course in the middle east. My expectations of finding a decent place to get my humus fix in Singapore were quite low, until I found Chef Khaled's Pistachio Grill!!!Chef Khaled uses only the finest ingredients in his kitchen. Everything he prepared was fresh, homemade and delicious. All his dishes were a perfect balance of sauces and garnishes, an obvious result of both his years of experience and his love of preparing middle eastern food. The humus with cooked chickpeas, the labneh with walnuts, the saffron rice with raisins, the mixed grill with garlic sauce, the tomato soup with pistachios. His baklava was perfect, just perfect. I cannot wait to go back again and again and try everything on his menu!Thank you, Chef!!
5
Had a birthday gathering for a friend at Pistachio Grill last night and the entire group raved about the food. We ordered way too much, but we enjoyed everything we ordered, from the pistachio salad to the hummus and pita to the delicious mains of mixed grill, fish chermoula, spaghetti with prawns and more. If we had to pick the best dish we tried, it's probably the beef rib on the customised menu. We were so glad we ordered that in advance! The chef was really friendly and had a chat with us. He made a lovely chocolate lava cake for the birthday girl. Everyone agreed that we will be back!
5
Chef Khaled food is must try he is professional Chef and good human being, he cook from heart 😀😀😀😀
5
We can fully recommend this lovely restaurant - Delicious and authentic food from the orient served by very friendly staff. The chef Khaled celebrate its own creations with full passion.
Don't miss the handmade Baklava - Amazing!
5
Chef has chosen fresh and quality ingredients and whips up great tasting food! Highly recommend the tomato soup with pistachios!
4
The lamb chops and mussels were very good. Dessert baklava with ice cream was delicious. Food Flavours were unique and reservation was kept timely
5
A very beautiful experience served with awesome attitude....great gesture of customer service from both owners and staffs...especially Agnes whom have even taken her good time to explain more about the food served and what it contains....would definitely strongly recommend meat lovers...😃Morgan&Shanti

Well grilled to medium . Angus is more robust than Waygu cut . Authentic Pita bread. Good Lava cake.
5
The food prepared by Chef Khalid was truly a gastronomic journey! Excellent grilled fish (advance order required), Turkish Pide, Hummus Kawerma with Pita bread , mussels, Egyptian Fetter (advance order required for this dessert), Konafa Cheese are amazing.... Will definitely come back for more! :)
5
Ordered the hummus, tomato soup, cheese & garlic pide, chicken and prawns. All were delicious. Soup was creamy which the kids liked. Chicken was nicely seasoned and tender. Rice was fluffy.
5
We already visited this place and were amazed by the quality of the food. I must say that we enjoyed it even more this time because our expectations were high and we haven't been disappointed. Food, presentation, professionalism..you have it all.Looking forward to seeing you in a more appropriate environment. All the best to the chef Khaled and his wife Agnes. Wish them all success they deserve
5
The beef rib was out of this world, must try. The food were cooked and prepared on the spot, really value for money. The chef and his wife are very friendly and they take care of what they offered. the place is always fully booked , so book in advance. Really must try and you will not be disappointed
4
Great food . Personal service with care
Definitely Would go back
A little gem - food made and served with heart
5
Food is excellent, Service was great, definitely have the hummus and dessert! You cant go wrong with any of the food.

Overall, the food was good. It was well cooked, but not outstanding. Price wise the majority of the items on the menu were reasonable (with the exception of water, which I will get into more detail later). Chicken kebab was tender, Beef rib was tasty (albeit overpriced at $60. I can get a much bigger slab of ribs from Morganfields for less.). The Pida was probably the tastiest item. Fresh, well cooked and nicely presented. There are a couple of issues which made my experience there unpleasant.1- Service was slow and careless. We had to approach the counter to ask for service. Even after having done that had to re approach them to remind them on the initial request. 2- We went with our kids (6 kids) and ended up paying $35 dollars for water! That, to me, is unreasonable for water, especially given that from tap it is usually FREE at most restaurants. The water were 350ml (tiny bottles) each at $2.50. Yes, we had 14 bottle of water, and we were literally still thirsty after that. 3- Staff were rude. We gave a staff our feedback on the water and that perhaps they should reconsider how much they were charging, or to give alternative of tap water at least (either with or without charge). His reply to us was that it's not possible since restaurant is not making money off the water. What a strange reply.... Asked him nicely if we could speak with the owner who was obviously present, but was told he was unavailable.4- Thereafter staff asked us if he can take our chairs, which our kids were sitting at. We were quite offended since we were still obviously eating. At which point we were told to leave since out time was up. (hummm....)Overall, the food was fine, but frankly for the total price paid, we could have had a much better experience elsewhere, both in terms of ambiance and especially service. The owner really needs to review the price for their water and service.If you want to go, suggest you drink plenty of water beforehand
5
We went there thrice last week. The 200 day Angus beef short ribs always has the consistency that we have come to expect. And the salt baked red snapper was also excellent. We tried it on Friday and since it was so good I went back with colleagues. Glad they agreed with my sense of taste. And value.
4
Not my first time here. Initially had to get use to dining in open area but by my 3rd visit did not seem to feel the strange feeling. The food was always good and definitely different from local Singapore fare. Today we pre ordered the beef ribs slow cooked in bismatic rice and it was a mouthwatering experience. The area is small by have always been crowded for sometime. Suggest you make a reservation. We also ate the lamb chops and it was very fine indeed well marinated and cooked to perfection. I saw the next table eating a tomahawk beef which looked very juicy, that maybe my next future order. Seriously go there for the food not the ambience.
5
Catered food from.the restaurant for a family gathering last week. The food was simply amazing and delicious! Ordered the rice, mussels beef ribs, lamb shoulders and chicken kebabs as well as 2 pizzas. The kids love the pizza and the rest of us enjoyed the food very much. Best to be eaten while it is still warm. Only self collect is available for now.
1
We ordered a couscous for 2. We have waited 45 minutes to have a ridiculous portion which was even not tasty.38SGD for two small sausage and and 2 stick of lamb.I'm very disappointed
5
Authenticity of the food and the staff is absolutely awesome and the Dodd is irrestiy delicious... Aroma attracts to dine in all the time I visit the mall to buy my groceries. Would like to visit again along with my family.. Thanks and cheers to Chef and staff
5
Had a great lunch with the Pistachio Mix Grill for Two. Chicken was succulent with plenty of flavours coming from the spices and marinates. Lamb chops were well-cooked and the kebab was great too.At first glance the portion of saffron rice and salad may seem too little but the meat quickly filled our stomach and adequately.Chef Khaled also took the effort to speak to diners about the food and the experience.Maybe one suggestion would be yoghurt mint sauce to complement the grill and to counter abit of the greasiness? Just a feedback
5
Looks are truly deceiving, we were introduced to this eatery by good friends. Although it looks like a fast food outlet, it is absolutely contrary. The food was delicious, superbly prepared and of the highest quality. Try the beef and lamb. It was scrumptious. This is a must try for all foodies. For the quality of food the price is very reasonable. Will have no hesitation recommending this outlet. Wish they had more space. Please book b4 going to avoid disappointment. It's got my thumbs up.
4
The black mussel I can have so many and the bread is just fantastic. The owner and service is super friendly. I will try pita next time I visit.
5
Reasonably priced , freshly prepared healthy food that is so delicious , and memorable .
There is no other place in Singapore where one can get such delightful , well balanced , not overpowering Middle Eastern flavours and the service is good too! 👍🏼😋
5
Their pizza are worth the try. Not only of the unique serving style but the pastry is freshly made, soft and awesome!
Their food has a lot of soul and love.
3
Wonderful Greek food, we went for the typical hummus and pita bread, skewered meat and Greek salad of course. It's restaurant quality food but location was somewhat strange. If you're looking for good Greek food and don't care about the environment, you'll love Pistachios.
5
I brought my family consisting of 11 members and everyone enjoyed the food It was better than we expected and the Chef Khaleed was most helpful. His wife Agnes is the perfect host and her recommendations are just great. This month end I am bringing some NUH Medical Specialists for dinner and I am sure they will enjoy it thoroughly. Highly Recommended
5
I love this place. The food are very delicious! Supper yummy! The chicken with saffron rice is very yummy!!! And the beef ribs is so so succulent, melt in your mouth and tender!!! And the to die for dessert "Konafa" omg it s so so nice ...it s not too much sweet, crunchy, freshly made with the ice-cream but you have to wait a bit about 20mins because it's freshly made according to order. It's really really worth it! And the chef Khalid and his wife Agnes is such a very nice person. The chef will come out and say hi the the customer and you can see that he is a very genuine person. I can see the way he cook the way he serve the customer, he is really taking care when he cook and care about the customer that he provide a nice delicious,heathy, good quality food. It's really really worth every single cent that you paid. You should try it! Make sure to make a reservation if you come in a big group or coming on a weekend. They are pretty busy:) All i can tell is that i love the food here! If you never try it you will never know

We visited this restaurant based on TripAdvisor reviews and we simply loved it. Itâ€™s one the best restaurants in Singapore, serving amazing, delicious, middle-eastern food. Book your table in advance as it is rightfully always full. You need to order the food at the counter which is later served at your table.The food surpassed our expectation. As a vegetarian, I was not the least bit disappointed. I had ample choices and I was filled till the brim. We ordered the tomato soup, garlic cheese pita bread, falafel, vegetarian Turkish Pide and 3 dips. My son ordered the Shish taouk, tender skewered chicken served with delicate saffron rice. Since we love our food spicy we also ordered a red chilli paste (not on the menu) which was just mind boggling. Every dish is prepared from scratch by Chef Khaled, using the freshest of the ingredients, no preservatives, and no colouring. His passion, sincerity and commitment comes across his cooking. We had a very nice chat with Chef Khaled and while talking to him we came to know he has been associated with top 5 star restaurants and has over 20 years of experience. Using this experience, he and his wife have ventured out to start a restaurant of their own. He does not believe in taking short cuts or using store bought sauces. He also readily shared the recipes of some of his dishes. While discussing how the spicy chilli paste is made, I was shocked to know that it takes nearly 6 months to prepare it. Each and every item are sourced from the best suppliers. My son could not stop raving about the chicken, describing it as tender, juicy, and unique.Overall we had an amazing 5 Star experience and we will definitely be returning for a mouth-watering, delicious, and authentic Mediterranean feast again

We asked them where to sit, they just stand there said free seating and when we sit down at 12.15pm, they walk over said we have to finish the meal by 1pm else we can't sit down. The restaurant only hv 2 families and whole place is empty.Will never step into in! Very very bad treatment to customers

Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first. If you are here for a romantic evening you will be disappointed--the location is not great (in a shopping mall and you will be sitting in the mall) and in my opinion takes a bit out of the overall experience. But that is where the bad news ends. If you are going to this restaurant because of the food experience, that is a very different story. I went here with 5 friends, we are all foodies and we have been to some amazing restaurants around the world. We dont care so much about the environment, we are more concerned about what we put in our stomachs! And Pistachio does not disappoint here. From totally a 'food' perspective, it is some of the best food in Singapore. A blend between Egyptian, Lebanese and Greek, you can see the love the husband/wife owners puts into the cooking. The dips were excellent, the flat pita bread (which is huge) comes to your table piping hot. Every single dish we had was meticulously prepared and I highly recommend the ribs if they have it that day. The dessert special is a combination of filo and cheese--wow!!The other downside for some may be there is no alcohol sold, but that was no problem for us as we brought some very good wine with us that went beautifully with the meat dishes.......and lets face it who wants to pay Singapore wine prices in restaurants (dont get me started) here. There is no corkage charge. The dinner bill? $50 each and we could not move afterwards because we ate so much. To the owners: Keep on doing what you are doing, we loved your food and will be back

My husband and I had lunch at Pistachio Grill on 24 June with 3 other friends who are from Israel. We brought them there for 2 reasons! Excellent foodExcellent service.We have dined there on numerous occasions and loved the food. Having learnt recently that the restaurant was number 1 in TripAdvisor, all the more, we have to bring our friends there. We booked early, a week in advance, knowing how popular and crowded the restaurant can be, especially on a weekend. The service, as usual, was top notched although the restaurant was very crowded. My advice for people who rated the restaurant 1 star merely because they could not get a reservation, please book early. The food was wonderful, especially the tender short ribs cooked to perfection and the deliciously fluffy and warm pita bread that comes with the various dips. The setting is simple but the food and service more than made up for it. Do understand that Pistachio Grill prides itself on the hearty food and not some fancy fine dining restaurant.It is at heart a warm and cosy restaurant that serves great Middle Eastern Mediterranean food
5
The taste and quality of the food is just magnificent. We especially enjoyed the lamb chops with the delicious moussaka. The humus and pita bread is also a must try as a starter.
I definitely would recommend this place to everyone who likes great food.
4
A very good, unique place. Food is wonderful setting is different though somewhat strange but highlight (as it should) is food!!!
5
My team went there after work. We had an enjoyable experience, and the meat was excellent. We especially enjoyed the beef tomahawk which Chef Khaled carved for us.
5
The dips and the garlic pita bread are fantastic, falafel was excellent. The Fish Chermoula had very interesting flavors. The shawarma was well made too. Will definitely come back again.
5
Had a very nice dinner with colleagues at Pistachio Grill. Food and desserts were excellent! We were very delighted with the sharing by the chef on his experience and cooking philosophy. Highly recommended!
5
It's hard to find a place that serves food from the heart with reasonable pricing and accommodating staff. If you are looking for non preservative food & natural ingredients, then you must try this simple casual joint. BYO wines with no corkage charge. But please bring your own wine glasses. The Husband and Wife team comes around to chat with customers on the food and shares the food preparation too. I brought a friend who has lacto intolerance, Chef Khaleed went all the way to prepare a desert that ls lacto free for my friend. Awesome Chef Be prepared to wait if you did not make prior reservations. It's definitely worth waiting. Thank you Chef Khaleed , Agnes & awesome staffs for always making me and my guests leaving full and satisfied. Cheers and we will be back.

Since it was a public holiday off in lieu of Hari Raya Puasa, we managed to have a seat as we made a booking in advance. It is a family-run restaurant by Chef Khaled and his wife Agnes. There are lots of thoughts and personal touches in the way they run the place. It is becoming very popular with people. Booking is highly recommended on public holidays and weekends. Parking at the mall is free on weekends and public holidays. For weekdays, you can park for free from 12 pm to 2 pm.The foods served are always heavenly delicious, and you do not feel bloated, as mentioned by some diners. Their black mussel with garlic sauce was a delight to kick start your lunch. For desserts, the children love the chocolate lava cake. They almost licked the 'remnants' from their plates. You must need time and patience for them to prepare foods from scratch. Chef Khaled and his team really took time and efforts to cook the dishes we orders. The quality of food was equivalent to many good restaurants. However, you would not need to pay an astronomical price for them. For those diners who expect a fantastic dining ambience, please do not bother to turn up. A slight note....You would just miss a wonderful treat and dining experiences for yourself and your family.
1
It is something like street food....this is everything but a proper restaurant. This is what I do not like of TripAdvisor ...categories are not the right on
1
i did a reservations they mess up with the days and Agnes call me very rude and blame me for the mistake after I ask several times if they had reservation for saturday... extremely rude, no respect for the clients, no idea what customer service means, how can you run a business treating people bad..
5
Off the beaten track and tucked away in the corner of a food court,The food, service and hospitality is second to none and worthy of a a five star restaurant.After a delicious homemade hummus and pita starter you forget the surroundings and enjoy the taste and smells of Morocco.Thank you for an amazing meal. We will be back
5
Excellent service and superb food. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Kudos to chef Khaled, manager Agnes & the rest of the team!
We will definitely visit Pistachio Grill often and invite family and friends.
5
amazing food with a unique taste that is not commonly found in Singapore. I plan to bring more and more of my friends.
5
We visited this restaurant based on tripadvisor review and we loved it! As mentioned by other reviewers, the dining area is in the middle of the shopping mall and you have to go to the counter to order and pay for the food then go back to your table and be served by the waiters. The lady who took our order was very helpful and friendly. She was happy to accommodate our request for the mixed grill which was not normally served during busy lunch hour. She also recommended the roast beef ribs too. She then stopped us from over-ordering. While we were waiting for our food, the table next to us did a spoiler and said the food will be extremely good thus raising our expectation even further. And they were right and then some more. The mixed grills and the roast beef ribs were exquisite! The portion was very generous for a family of 4 with 2 teenage sons. We have been to Blu Kouzina and tried lebanese food in Middle East but this place is at a different level all together. OK there is not much of ambience to talk about when seated in the middle of shopping mall but you pay significantly less for great tasting food and no service charge add on. While I think this place will do very well as a stand alone fine dining restaurant, I am happy for them to stay put and let us enjoy the great food at a very reasonable price. By the way parking did I mention parking is free for the first couple of hours

My family and I made a reservation at Pistachio to celebrate my mother's birthday. Having tried many Mediterranean restaurants in Singapore which did not live up to our expectations, we were keen to find a good restaurant to satisfy mum's cravings. After doing some searching on authentic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food in Singapore, we were eager to put the overwhelmingly positive reviews we saw to a test. I'm glad to say we were not let down. We were extremely pleased with our food and the fantastic service provided for our special dinner. The food is flavourful, ingredients fresh and the personalised service we received from Chef Khaled and his wife, Agnes made us feel at home.An easy and fool-proof way to gauge the authenticity of Mediterranean food is by the most basic dish - the bread and dips. We ordered a pita bread and hummus (a dip made of chickpea puree). The pita bread was fluffy and hot from the oven, shaped like a giant submarine that is bound to wow guests. The hummus was very smooth, tasting exactly like it did when our Persian friends made it for us at their housewarming - authentic and amazing.The Pistachio Mix Grill is an absolute must-have as the 3 meats were tenderly grilled and oozing juices. Safron rice is very fragrant. Salad with rockets and baby spinach was fresh and the dressing was very tasty. Do try their Chocolate Lava. Chef told us it was made from scratch and it certainly tastes the part. The warm chocolate oozed from our cake as soon as we stuck our spoon into it. The texture is the right amount of gooeyness and spongyness. It tastes sublime with vanilla ice-cream and has to be one of the best chocolate lavas we've had here. Many thanks to Chef Khaled, Agnes, and the personable staff for the wonderful meal and service. Will definitely be back with friends to reveal this little gem hidden in the nook and cranny of Zhongshan Mall

Amazing!! Growing up in Dubai, its been an adventure searching for good arabic food here in Singapore for the past 3 years. Tried Pistachio grill after reading online reviews, and the food just absolutely amazing! Hubby and I felt like we were back home in Dubai! Now this is what you call AUTHENTIC AMAZING ARABIC food! You know the rest of the courses are going to be scrumptious when the hummus is just perfect !The owner is absolutely friendly and an amazing chef! I will definitely be coming back for more! We have eaten here 2 days in a row now 
5
This was an amazing food experience!We are leaving nearby and passing in front of this restaurant several times a week. It is in front of the escalator so location is not the best. BUT food is incredible. And the chef and the team are very kind. Best food experience in Singapore
5
Pistachio Grill serves 5 star food in a two star location at very reasonable price. It is run by a very professional couple which does not just provide excellent but very healthy food. Khalid the chef provides the best Middle Eastern Food in Asia. We had a three course lunch which did not make us feel bloated which is normal with Middle eastern and Indian cuisine. The setting is very basic but be not fooled the treat you will receive. A must visit when in Singapore
5
Everything we ordered was so flavourful. Even though it was in a shopping mall...it did not matter as the food was delicious and everything else incidental!The owner took the time to come and chat with us.. and gestures like this make a big difference!Definitely going back to try what we missed the first time round
4
We went there for an evening when we were craving for yummy middle eastern food and the food certainly addressed that craving. It was really yummy and fresh. The portions are really good as well. The Chef himself came to our table and checked on us. So, foodwise all good. Hearing the fab reviews of the place I certainly expected a resto ambience ( similar to fine dining) especially cos I had to make a reservation, but it is a constrained space in a mall. Certainly a lot of restaurants are in malls now a days but this being such fab food, the location is a big negative. The seating area is quite restricted, small table and overall area plus the noise of the mall. Not much of an ambience. Certainly will go there again for the food alone but one will always think what a wonderful experience it could have been if the delicious food was combined with an equally nice ambience. Fair enough there is no service charge but i wouldn't mind paying the charge if it gives an overall enjoyable dining experience.

You order your food at the counter and sit down in the middle of a shoppingmall in front of the stairs where it is very noisy. We had expected way more of the number one restaurant of singapore and were very disappointed. This is a foodcourt restaurant. The food was fine but not special. When we ordered meat we did not even get a knive only spoon and fork. Not very clever staff either.
5
Best middle eastern food I've tasted in Singapore in the last six years! Yes, you are sitting in a shopping mall but the food is fantastic, the value exceptional and the service top notch. Congratulations Pistachio!

If you are looking for an authentic middle eastern food... This is your place.
Food is deliciously cooked...

Ate once in the restaurant and did a takeaway on the second occasion. Very pleasant and casual with warm and friendly staff and the boss himself. Understand the boss used to work for many many years in a very senior Fn B position at the Shangrila hotel Singapore

This place surprises me with the consistency with which they do good food. A lot of the remarks by the chef are indeed true. The focus is on quality ingredients and superb authentic food. They are not very big so reservations are highly recommended since they just have 10 tables or so. Certainly not fine dining settings but top notch food. We have tried several dishes on the menu and the lamb chops and the chicken kebabs are my personal favorites along with the superb baklava with ice cream. Mains are about 15 to 30 reasonable for the quality they offer. I wish they remain exactly this way and not expand through a franchise model. That will be the end of good mid eastern food in Singapore ! Kudos to the che

We were looking for a different cuisine while in Singapore and found Pistachio Grill, with wonderful sounding Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. We had some difficulty finding the restaurant, since the set up is quite different......a small desk where one orders and pays and then proceeds to the middle of the mall for a seat. The busy staff then brings your food. We were able to bring a bottle of wine that we purchased upstairs at the supermarket, but not any beer. The hummus was a credible rendition, and the freshly baked pita bread was outstanding! My husband had a platter of grilled beef kabob with rice and a lovely arugula salad. I chose the lamb sausages (3) which were fine but not as flavorful as the kabob. The staff seemed very busy but they were pleasant and accommodating. We enjoyed our lunch, once we understood the ground rules

We visited Singapore as part of our honeymoon and was craving some tasty food. We called Pistachio Grill to reserve a table explaining It was our honeymoon and was told that the restaurant seating area was in the middle of the shopping mall. Undeterred, we thought who cares, providing the food would be good... and boy was it... Chef produced some excellent food; perfectly cooked meat with just the most amazing taste. Thinking about it makes me want to fly back to Singapore. The owner previously worked for end end restaurants before opening his own little gem!!! Thank you for amazing food and real friendly hospitality!

This is a restaurant that excites me to write my first food review on social media. I haven't tried the middle-eastern food in Hong Kong before, but I started loving the exoticism of the cuisine.As expected and told by other food reviews, there gonna be a tug-of-war between food quality and ambience/ environment. Trust me. Everybody knows the pain; the fancier the shop is, the more expensive food gets. Thankfully, you can hit up Pistachio Grill for some cheap yet authentic and luscious middle-eastern food. Every dollar you spend here goes directly to the premium quality of delicacies. When you see the freshness of food and presentation of dishes, you just have ravenous appetites naturally.We made orders for black mussels with cream-cheese sauce, pita bread, tomato soup and kebabs. They were awesome. Grilled meat was soft and tender while pita bread tasted incredible with the home-made eggplant dressing with sour cream. The service was pleasant as well. Both Chef Khaled and Manager Agnes greeted us and asked for our feedback. Adjustments would be made subject to patrons' taste preferences, which were sort of credits to their service. To sum up, it is always up to you; either you want to splurge on an environment that feeds your eyeballs or to remain down-to-earth for real tasty food. To me, a foodie will prefer the latter. Keep it up! This restaurant deserves much more recognition and attention

Went there with my wife for lunch, when we get there our first impression was not that good. A very smal counter where you go and order and then the tables where in the midle of the mall. But we decided to give it a try since we where there. A great decision.The food was really good. I went to restaurants were in singapore were I paid 200+ per person and the food was not as tasty as this one. Of coure the sorroundings and the service wasen't the same. But a great value having into account that I paid 20 per person for better food.Defenetly a must try and retry in singapor

Went there for lunch today. Food was awesome and beyond our expectations. Pita freshly baked pita bread was light and tasty. Grill meat was tender and soft. Saffron rice was light. Chef was very friendly and explained to us how the food he cooked was actually very healthy and Low GI. He was very proud of his food. For those who love spiciness, u got to ask him for the 15days Chilli.
5
This is our second time to this restaurant Chef Khaled and Agnes are very hospitable and warm people. Eating at their restaurant will make you feel comfortable and welcome. We ordered hummus, baba ghannoush and pita bread...yum. The Greek moussaka...so yum. We had beef ribs and grilled lamb chops.. everything was delicious and well presented. Other people might not like that this restaurant is at the lobby of a shopping mall but we love that this restaurant is unpretentious and that the focus is on good quality food and service. So, two thumbs up for Pistachio Grill. We will definitely eat here again

Very good food with natural ingredients and friendly chef to explain health benefits of Mediterranean style food.

I love Middle-Eastern food and having lived in Dubai I have tasted authentic and the best you can find! Back in Singapore my cravings for good Middle-Eastern food have more often than not fell very short of authenticity. But finally, I have found a restaurant that meets my highest expectations in every dish that I ordered! It's called PISTACHIO GRILL located conveniently in Ah Hood Road inside Zhongshan Mall. If you drive and parked in the basement and come up the escalator you will see it immediately right in front of you with little white 'picket fence'. It's a comfortable small eatery with one side opened and set in casual seating. I invited a group of friends who are Foodies and very discerning in their palates to join me and every dish satisfied their fussy taste buds. The hummus was yummy, smooth and full of flavour and when spread on the freshly baked Pita bread (which was thin and crispy) it just brings out the whole combination of the Huumus and the freshness of the bread. The next dish was the Turkish Pride which had nice juicy pieces of beef cooked just right! Then came the Pistachio Mix Grill with skewers of lamb on bone, Adana kebab and Chicken Kebab served hanging over a plate of saffron rice with cashew nuts and raisins. The meats were really yummy and juicy with the flavours oozing out of every bite!Then the much-awaited lamb shank was served with a bowl of saffron rice. It was WOW! The lamb was so tender and full of flavour (a very tasty sauce with nuts was spread over the shank). It's not over yet! Desserts - we were recommended the hot chocolate lava and it was heaven! The sweetness was just right and the chocolate oozed out as you cut into the cake and we quickly scooped it up with our spoons and it was smooth and warm and yummy! We had one more dessert that was recommended but not on the menu - a typical Turkish dessert made of strips of filo pastry and it is baked fresh (takes 25 minutes) when you are just about finishing your main meal, so it's just right that you take your tummy takes a rest to prepare for the dessert.I will certainly go back again to try the other dishes. The strange thing is that I don't leave feeling stuffed (although we prefer quite a bit of meat items) but fully satisfied. I put it down to the way the food was cooked, not oily, flavours sealed into the meat and all freshly cooked.Last but not least, Chef Khaled, the man behind the cooking was very engaging and took time to visit every diner's table to enquire about their food experience and taking time to explain how some of the items are cooked to Ensure authenticity and freshness. It makes all the difference and it shows how passionate he is about his creations and putting his heart and soul into the food preparation.I am finally happy that I found a place to satisfy my cravings

Above average food, noisy open environment sitting in the lobby of mall with kids playing and shoppers all around, drinking water not served but have to pay $2.50 for bottled water. Overall a disappointing experienc
5
Everything is so flavoursome, the quality of the ingredients shining through. We had baba ganoush, A Shish Kebab with egg white garlic sauce and freshly baked bread, and the Moroccan spiced red snapper with saffron rice. My mouth is watering writing this now, remembering how good it all was! The chef came out and introduced himself and we had a chat for about 10 minutes, lovely humble guy with great skills and a passion for quality. This place is not a stylish location, it's all about the food, and it shines.

My family has tried middle eastern grills on several occasions and found the texture grilled meats could be better UNTIL ... we tasted the grilled meats at the Pistachio Grill yesterday. We started with Pita bread that came along with chickpeas paste. The freshly baked Pita was soft and and chickpeas paste had a nutty taste ... that we unknowing keep eating non stop and it was gone in minutes! Next, when the friendly staff presented us the Pistachio Mix Grill ... consists of Adana kebab, chicken kebab and lamb chops ... we thought it could be the usual grilled meats that we tasted at other places. As soon as we bite into the chicken kebab, our eyes opened wide and looked at each other expressing the pleasure that we had while chewing it. Simply Amazing ... the texture was so tender and the moist was just right. Wow! immediately, we 'attacked' the lamb chop and Adana kebabs to see if the texture were consistent ... it was! The saffron rice that was served with the grilled meats complemented the grills so well. Don't like the size and location fool you, friendly staff especially the owner who is also the chef. The Pistachio Grill is truly a gem ... my family will certainly be back to try other dishes. Thank yo

Saw this restaurant as i went for breakfast at the mall. One week later, we went for dinner. Smallish restaurant but food was really good, especially the chicken which was exceptionally tender. Had freshly baked pita with baba ganoush, lamb shank, cheese side for my son and chicken with saffron rice.Will visit again

Tucked in the corner of Zhongshang Mall ground floor atrium is a small eatery that fascinates. It will please the palate more than the "feel" of the ambiance. Set in the main atrium of Zhongshan Mall, it gives you the feel of a al fresco dining in air-conditioned comfort. Be seen to be enjoying great food!A #1-rated eatery does bring about some expectations like ambience, romance, style. If you value those factors more, you may be disappointed. However, if you enjoy great food cooked with passion and love, this is the place to be. Pistachio is a cafe-like restaurant with satisfying meals waiting to be savoured.While Khaled (who was the Mediteranean Chef at Shangrila) labours in the kitchen to bring out the best for your meal, Agnes, the hostess, will make sure that your meal will not disappoint
5
Great place to have something Mediterranean or Turkish to eat and good hospitality from all the staff specially the lady who was serving me. I had the Turkish platter it was great, but I wished the quantity of the food was a bit bigger(I have a big appetite ).Make sure you have cash if you are a foreigner and if you don't have local kind of debit card. For Muslims it is a place to go because they are serving #Halal food
5
I visited Pistachio Grill a few weeks ago with my family for my birthday, and it was nothing short of excellent. The food was absolutely ravishing; each and every single meal done to perfection. The freshness of the herbs and spices could be tasted, while the tenderness of the meat made it easy for it to be eaten. In addition, Chef Khalid's personal interaction with my family made the lunch extra special. He took time out of his kitchen to check on us regularly, and striking up conversations with us about his past experiences
5
Everyone should try this place at least once!! Tucked in Zhongshan Mall in Balestier, there lies an extraordinary hidden gem that serves truly authentic Mediterranean food. It was our second time here for birthday feastings and I am sure there will be many more times to come! We ordered chicken soup, tomato soup, pita bread with hummus dip, spaghetti allo scogli, Moroccan couscous and wrapped the dinner up with baklava ice cream and hot chocolate lava. ALL dishes were made with the finest ingredients, and much effort, thought, timing and PASSION! What makes Pistachio Grill stand out is that it has NO GST and NO SERVICE CHARGE and yet, it comes with EXEMPLARY service and outstanding food!!! Amidst their busy schedule, owner Chef Khaled and Agnes made effort to come by to visit table by table, greet customers and strike up small conversations. I personally know Agnes more than 20years back and she is a definitely no short-cut person and that explains food and service.The restaurant has 2 timings for evening reservations: 6.30pm and 7.45pm which makes nice arrangements for staggered seatings to avoid overcrowding. The beauty of having the space at the atrium of the shopping mall is that even if you have active kids, there are spaces for run about to run about. And if you have a crying baby, there is no need to bring them outside of restaurants like what some of us do, simply because we are already outside in the open space!! Thank you once again for Chef Khaled and Agnes for bringing the top-notch authentic flavour of Middle Eastern cuisine into this part of Singapore!
5
What can I say - watch this space, Khaled is poised to become a star of the fine dining scene in Singapore. And he's so lucky to have Agnes standing by him. Cheers!

I with my boyfriend went there for dinner. The food is great. We had pita bread, baba ganoush and mixed grill. I loved dessert there. We go there many times and always very good.
5
Had a lovely dinner at Pistachio Grill and the food was so delicious. We ordered the black mussels, pita bread with baba ghannoush dip, grilled chicken, baked fish and pizza, which all tasted amazing. All the dips and sauces were made in-house as well, so it was very fresh and tasty. We loved everything!Chef Khaled and his team were warm and hospitable. It's an excellent place to enjoy a great meal. Definitely a must-visit
5
We were six of us and had the beef rib which was deliciously slow cooked, melted off the bone, and served on a bed of Egyptian rice with spices and nuts. The hommous and babaghanoush and freshly baked bread was scrumptious too! Very affordable as well
5
Forget the mall setting - the food makes up for it. There are two times for dinner 6 and 7:45, so book in advance as there are limited seats and tables are mostly fully booked each day. I had the lamb shank tagine (28$) which was incredible, a large portion of meat which was beautifully flavoured. The chef came out and spoke to us all, and the staff were very attentive. We were allowed to bring a bottle of wine as it was a special occasion (no corkage fee).
4
The restaurant is very popular for being opened only 10 months, situated in front of elevators leading up to a huge grocery store Fair Price, awful bright lights in this space... Then we tasted the food, YUM. It is so great when a place is popular for its substance rather than appearance - and the staff - excellent, very professional, kind. We relished the humus, baba ganoush, pita bread, and hot lava cake. The cake takes 8 minutes and so we ordered it when we ordered everything else. One of the owners said that they are already looking for better space. I'll give it 5 stars then :) We will definitely return sooner!!

We attempted our luck by having a lunch there after seeing many positive comments in Tripadvisor. Our orders were: - pita bread and humus (really nice)- black muscle (creamy, tasty, and not fishy)- pistachio grill (their chicken kebab is just perfect!!) All costed two of us for SGD 68We enjoyed the way they cook and marinate the chicken, very tender and just adequately marinated so you can enjoy it until the last bite! The saffron rice we had together with the kebab was oke, nothing extraordinary. Unfortunately, this is not a restaurant, more like a dinner where people are seated in the hallway of the mall, so the ambience was not as comfortable as what I expected. Thing went worse by having two male servers prohibiting us seat in the table we want, and they place the food we ordered like we did not pay for it :( One female waiter was kind enough explaining what sauce accompanied the Pistachio Grill. I was hoping all the servers were just like her. Well, if you like mediteranean food and do not mind eating in an ordinary setting, this would be great for you! Their food was good, only the service and place needed more improvement.

We had our anniversary dinner in Pistachio Grill. It's a relatively new establishment, in a unique setting -- it's inside a mall. There may be mixed responses about the mall setting from the other visitors; however, if you're a "no-frills" person, you will definitely love this place. The food was beyond amazing -- the chicken was juicy and tender, and the baba ganoush couldn't be fresher. I can't wait to visit again soon for their delicious Middle Eastern food.The Chef swung by our table briefly to introduce himself and to ask about the food. After learning that we were celebrating our anniversary, the Chef even gave us a little surprise at the end (thanks again!). He was genuinely passionate about the food he was serving, and you will be able to tell that passion from the quality of food once you visit
5
Absolutely Fantastic, extremely affordable Mediterranean food in Singapore. While the seating area is informal as it is located in a mall, don't let that fool you. The food is excellent. The service is excellent. The owners are extremely friendly. I look forward to my next trip to Singapore, so I can eat here again. Bring your own wine as they don't have a liquor license
5
I went to this restaurant not sure what to expect. Sometimes you read glowing reports in TripAdvisor and think, a Mediterranean restaurant set in the middle of shopping mall is a top ten restaurant in Singapore - really!?Yes - really. The food is beautifully (I would say lovingly prepared). The ingredients are high quality and the flavors and preparation 100% authentic. The service as several have mentioned is warm and personal and the lamb shank... well all I can say is it will make you a believer!Try it - you will be coming back. I am from Boston, (over 12k miles) away and I'll be back
5
Took our friends there tonight, we had starters of the yummy dips and each of us had a main course, the mix grill, lamb shanks and moussaka with lamb chops! Every dish was cooked to perfection! Desserts so good!! Highly recommend this place anytime !!

Tasty colourful medz food presented in an interesting eye-catching way. Topped up by personal service at a good price. Good value for $.

We went here because of the TripAdvisor rating. It was out of the way for us in a modern strip mall. Food was quite good and interesting but the seating is just outside in the mall. Not very expensive and the Egyptian owner was very friendly and compted us baklava in a box. But come on, number 1 or 3 out of all the Singapore restaurants with seating out in a strip mall. And we made reservations saying get there by 6:10pm or we will give your reservations away. It was not that busy. Many empty seats. They need to do a lot better to get this high rating
5
1.) Make reservation (way in advance).2.) Eat here.3.) Let me know if you know anywhere with better middle eastern cuisine.4.) If you think you know a better place, proceed to step 5.5.) You need to wake up coz you must be dreaming.Much to my embarrassment, I came to know of this place, from visiting friends from Egypt, Palestine and other middle eastern countries. They gave the thumbs up and said - This was some of the best they have eaten, ever.It's in the atrium of the mall, so if you want nice scenery, a fancy joint, lousy service and sub-standard overpriced food, be my guest, we have plenty of options in Singapore. But, if you want unpretentious, lovingly (I could picture the chef whispering sweet-nothings to the lamb shank) prepared food in a simple comfortable setting, then this is it. The restaurant is not halal certified, but the food are from halal sources. They do not sell alcohol, but they are ok with you bringing your own wine or beer (within limits of course) . Best to call and ask the friendly crew in advance!Dig in!!! Nom nom nom!!!!! Hahahah
5
My friend introduced Paul me to Pistachio. It was the best day ever! The food was scrumptious! I had my birthday celebration there and Chef prepared a feast ! I have since returned numerous times & I was never disappointed with the quality of food! The Tomahawk is worth dieting for! I have introduced many friends & every one loves the food. Chef Khaled does not compromise on quality. You can be guaranteed on it! Chef Khaled & Agnes are such warm hosts and it's a pleasure to dine there. Definitely worth the trip there
5
Had a lovely meal here with friends. It is a laid back, unpretentious cafe located within a mall. The tables and chairs are set up in the atrium area but the food is good. Really really good. It is absolutely necessary to make reservations on the weekend as they have 2 seatings only and are usually full. Alcohol is not served as it is a muslim establishment. The food is absolutely fantastic and of a very high quality, and very authentic
5
My wife and I had a wonderful 1st Wedding Anniversary dinner here. The quality of ingredients, all freshly made from scratch make the difference. The humus was the smoothest we have ever tasted and the home made garlic sauce was very light and goes well with any type of meat, especially the kebabs, as does their home made chili paste. Service is top-notch, Chef Khaled took the time to visit our table and his passion for the finest ingredients shone through in our conversation. To top off a super evening, we were treated to a lava cake with a "Happy Anniversary" written in edible gold powder for good luck and a fabulous off-menu ancient Greek/Palestinian dessert called Konafa. My wife and I highly recommend this restaurant. Even if the location is in the middle of a mall, the food will tranfix you and make you feel like you are in the middle of the Mediterranean. Thanks to Chef Khaled and Agnes and their staff for a lovely evening, we will be back soon. -Christian & Myl

Amazing food, good service. Value for money. Remmber to book. The lamb shank is super. They have special menu which you can order in advanceMust try
5
Chef Khaled and Agnes having been serving great tasting Mediterranean cuisine for almost a year at Zhong Shan mall , we try to visit at least once a month for their great tasting grilled meats , saffron rice and pizzas. As usual , tonight's mixed grilled of chicken, lamb and beef was spectacular, so tender, well marinated and extremely tasty. Their dishes are always prepared to perfection and never once have we been disappointed. Looking forward to our next visit soon
5
A friend of mine told us to try this place located in a shopping mall, although she knows I'm not really fond of a shopping centre environment. We really don't regret our lunch here that was 5 star in terms of quality as well as in terms of friendliness. The different dishes we tried as well as the lava cake dessert were awesome. Everything is home made and the price is more than reasonable. It would cost at least 3 or 4 times more in a more cosy location. Hurry up before they move !!
5
Great quality food with lots of vegetarian options. Pizzas were simply amazing, with various dip options.
Highly recommended.
4
Exemplary service and outstanding food. This is easily one of the best Mediterranean food available in Singapore. Only thing we didn't like is sitting in the open in middle of a mall and dining.
5
A great little gem. Authentic food. Superb hospitality.A refined chef who know the meaning of personalized service and the value of uncompromised quality. Relaxed environment. A must try. Well done Chef Khalid.
5
Excellent arab food. Fresh and juicy meats has been served touch with its perfection. I really recommend this restaurant and one of the best grill restaurant in Singapore.
4
Dined here a few weeks ago as a table of 6. The taste and quality of the meat served is excellent as is the service offered. Only improvement could be the location but I'm sure that'll come in the near future.
5
Embedded in the first level of Zhongshan Mall in the Balestier area, a delicious Mediterranean meal will surprise everyone. Meats, dips, breads, rice, sweets, sauces are all there to tease and please the palate.Owned by Chef Khaled and his wife, Agnes, the welcoming couple serves up an equally sumptuous meal. A definite must-try
5
Given how highly this restaurant is ranked I was surprised to see the setting in a local mall. But don't let that put you off!The service is brilliant, the food is amazing and Chef Khalid is a Gent.Ordered the Hummus with mince meat with the large piece of freshly made bread for starters. That set the scene and got rid of any misconceptions with the quality of the starter.Then had mixed grill and beef tenderloin kebab. Wow!! I know my kebabs and the mince beef kebab was out of this world. Smoky and melts in your mouth.They accommodated for my toddler son who is a fussy eater and they made him spaghetti from the lunch menu!The Chef topped it off with a Chocolate Lava cake that was AMAZING!There are a few folks in the reviews stating they found it expensive, I say you would be paying even more if you had this food in a more upmarket setting.A must try place and can't recommend enough. For sure I will be coming here again
5
This was my third time to visit Pistachio, and each and every time, Pistachio become my favorite restaurant in Singapore. The quality of the food is excellent and the care of preparation and attention to detail is unsurpassed. We were a group of four and ordered the Hummus and Baba Ghanoush and Kibbeh for meze.(of course wiht the homemade pita bread...to die for). We then had two sets of the mixed grill. It was all scrumptious and relatively inexpensive for food of this quality. I wish Chef Khaled and his partner all the luck and success they deserve, and hope that Michelin takes notice and gives this restaurant a Michelin star next year. It would be well deserved
4
A great family run restaurant. The food is great and so is the service. I found it pricey. Very limited seats in the restaurants.
4
The options were for vegetarians is limited. But the ones which were available are very good (soup, salad, pasta were the ones which we tried). The Kunafeh was superb..melted in the mouth...worth the 45 mins wait.. perfect end to the dinner
5
It has great food and it's very unique (obviously in a good way). I really recommend this restaurant. The pizza has great dough and everything was perfect. I don't regret anything about going to this restaurant.
5
I have been a vegetarian all my life and it's always a delight to find really good vegetarian food in tiny Singapore. The food portions are just nice and not too big or too small. I had the chocolate lava cake and it was one of the best I've ever had!! Would definitely go here again and bring my non vegetarians friends because everyone who ate the meat said it was also one of the best that they have had!!
5
Been to Pistachio Grill for a couple of times already. Chef Khaleed and Agnes are always providing their best food and service. They never fail to bring a smile to people whom I've brought here so far.Personal favourite is the Tomahawk steak which you have to order in advance. The rest of the menu is equally top quality. Agnes and Chef Khaleed are also very friendly making sure the guests are all well taken care of. Top notch service!
5
Went there for lunch on Sat with friends - quaint and unassuming place, with a very casual vibe. Didn't have any expectations but came recommended from word of mouth.Were we surprised when the food arrived - We had chicken wraps, Lebanese and Turkish Platter and the Lava cake and a filo pastry dessert that wasn't on the menu..must say...we will definitely be back...food was great and great recommendations from Agnes and her team. Met the chef Mr Khaled as well..prices are reasonable and would definitely rate the food quality as above some of the over-rated and expensive foodie jaunts that have cropped up in recent years. Would definitely recommend, but as the place is small..do make reservations
5
The Tomahawk steak did not disappoint. It was HUGE and excellent. The beef ribs we had was also great tasting with a generous serving of long grained basmati rice. The fish was a big red snapper and also really fresh and tasty. Then their desserts were all Super delicious and real great value for money. Didn't mind paying for the bottled water as everything else made up for the value. Definitely return soon with other. Seats are limited so book in advance.
5
It is nice to meet the friendly owner and chef Khaled who is so generous to share with us his secret recipe of the yummy soup we have tasted. It is also good to get to know him and hear about his passion for food and learnt of the great effort he puts into creating every dish with wholesome ingredients that are freshly prepared and nicely presented. My guest, whom has been to Marrakech, loves Mediterranean and middle eastern food. She said the dishes we ordered were really good and authentic as well. Even her young daughter loved the delicious tomato soup and salad including the soft and freshly baked pita bread. And her young son loves the pizza. My hubby is full of praises too for the grilled meats with fluffy saffron rice that is nicely decorated too. The gadget to transport the skewered meats is thoughtfully designed, user friendly and presentable. We also enjoyed the egg plant baked with cheese and potatoes, hummus and salad. The 2 lava cakes were prettily decorated and oozing with chocolatey perfection that we gobbled with refreshing morroccan mint tea! We would definitely come back and would highly recommend Pistachio restaurant to all our contacts. It is indeed a hidden gem
5
We tried the Pistachio Grill based off positive reviews in Trip Advisor. Initially we were a little hesitant as it appeared the restaurant was merely a Take-Away, and then surprised that the seating was in front, but in the middle of the mall. That hesitation quickly passed as were warmly greeted by our hostess, Agnes, owner of the Pistachio Grill. Agnes was very friendly and offered excellent recommendations, several of which were off-menu, while informing us how her husband, Chef Khaled and she initially met and decided to venture on their passion project. The food was simply delectable. We were treated to plate after plate of their Middle Eastern and Mediterranean delicacies.Chef Khaled visited our table and detailed the care that he goes through to bring the finest ingredients to his restaurant, importing spices from Iran and Oman. He mastered his craft as a chef at the Four Seasons in the Maldives, and it certainly shows.We highly recommend a visit and will definitely visit again. We wish Chef Khaled and Agnes continued fortune...and look forward to the opening of a bigger, fine-dining Pistachio Grill
5
He's a big fans of Middle eastern and Mediterranean food that's why I'm trying to give him a surprise. And We have to say the experience is FABULOUS. We totally feel the patience, love and passion in every dish Chef Khaled made. The hummus and the pita bread are incredibly tasty and freshly prepared. The creamy mussels and the mixed grills, as well as the saffron rice, are just perfect. And we deeply appreciate the care and service to the customers from Chef Khaled, Agnes and the team. We feel warm about it. It is definitely a hidden GEM and we will for sure be coming back! Again, highly 5 stars recommendation to our friends! :-
5
Delicious, unpretentious and heartwarming food was what we had when I brought my family to Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill last Saturday evening. Not only were our stomachs well taken care of, Chef Khaled, Agnes and their team ensured that we had a enjoyable dining experience with their great hospitality. Will definitely be back again
5
Food that is absolutely fresh and made simple. Fact is simple dishes are the most difficult to stand out. I must say the chef here put his heart and soul into his food served. Simple deco and no flashy decorations. The food served does the talk. A must try
5
If U want to try a delicious menu, pistachio is the place to visit. Price is fare and they have lunch sets for a decent price and the best....the Chef and the quality.
5
Not your usual Orchard Road or trendy hip location downtown but in the middle of a shopping centre concourse off Balestier Rd. It seems an unlikely place to find an authentic Middle Eastern restaurant owned by Egyptian chef Khaled who is a charming soft spoken man and his lively Singapore wife Agnes. Make a point of ordering the Roast Short Ribs of Beef beforehand. Its succulently marinated and the meat falls off the bone being slow roasted for many hours in the oven. The bread which is made on the premises is excellent too and very more-ish. Good for groups of friends and kid-friendly as well
5
Truth be told, I am not a fan of Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food...until now! The food was amazing! Chef Khaled had obviously cooked each and every dish with lots of care, patience and love. The explosion of spices coupled with the method of slow cooking was quite extraordinary. Be sure to order the beef rib (order in advance please) though, quite honestly, the rest of his grilled meats are also fantastic. We finished with the molten lava cake and baklava..... be warned! Whatever you do, save space for dessert
5
The ingenuous Chef Khaled serves a sumptuous feast that I kept coming back for. Everything on the menu is delicious. His beef ribs (please order ahead) are to die for! His desserts are mouth-watering, his wife Agnes - so delightful! Good service too
4
The food at Pistachio Grill indeed is excellent! The hummus is outstanding! I tried a lobster bisque that was served with a large prawn, the flavor was very delicious! Then I tried the lamb tagine which was excellently prepared with awesome flavors in the sauce, would love to try a chicken tagine in the future. The tagine was served with rice made with cashews and raisins, this was exquisite!I would recommend the restaurant for excellent food, casual dinner and very reasonable price

With Chef Khaled in the kitchen creating every dish with meticulous attention to freshness, detail and consistency and his dear wife Agnes helping guide you through the menu and taking your orders while she handles the cash register and supervises the friendly service staff who bring your order to your table, this restaurant offers by far the best and most freshly-prepared middle-eastern cuisine in all of Singapore. I am very familiar with this cuisine since I have the same roots. As an ex-Shangri-La chef who has now ventured into his own restaurant business with his wife Agnes, his standards are very high and the customer-experience is always very satisfying. We have eaten here numerous times during both lunch and dinner periods. Every experience has been fabulous.The only down-side is that the restaurant is rather limited in seating capacity and you may have to wait a while for your meal - since Chef Khaled either is personally preparing the meal himself or is very closely supervising its preparation. His Pita and Pide breads are all freshly made and are the best I have ever had anywhere in this world. This has to be Singapore's "best-kept" secret - but it won't be for long - thanks to the glorious reviews and delighted customers passing the word around

We had a great night in Pistachio Grill to celebrate my birthday. I read some reviews in advance, one says the restaurant is a hidden jem. In fact, it deserves the praise. To my surprise, the saffron rice is so good!!!! With cashew and raisin topping, the rice tastes very fragrant, which is better than any saffron rice I ate in Iran before. The creamy mussels and lamb shank are really tasty. And regard to the mixed grill, the meat is succulent not stiff. The chef and staff are warmhearted, they offer us chocolate lavas as a birthday surprise！Most of my friends are first time to try Middle Eastern cuisine, the restaurant leaves them a very positive impression

Had heard great things about this restaurant and we were still blown away. Everything was delicious the best middle eastern food we have ever had in Singapore. The kids loved the pizzas and pita bread top marks for the royal cous cous, mixed grill and dips. Well worth a visit
5
The team of husband Mr Khaled (the chef) and wife Ms Agnes (frontline) succeeded in doing what pleases their guests most - top quality ingredients with exceptional culinary skill combined with the warmest sincere personalised service you can find...with the added bonus of affordable prices. You get all this easily in one nice package. Look through its website to select special dishes not on the main menu. Ask the couple to prepare a special dish. Bring your own bottle. No corkage and service charge. All these and more to surprise you. We urge you to give them a try. You won't regret

We looked at the menu and she wanted 'light and salad' and he wanted 'meat' and the menu offered the best combination for everyone! The pita was incredible. Babaganoush delicious - the addition of pomegranate was amazing! Meeting the chef and his front of house made our night - they were so friendly and enthusiastic. Best customer service we've had, ever! And we've eaten in some of the best restaurants all over the world. High calibre team.Don't hesitate to eat here. You will not regret it.

Came here a couple of times for lunches and dinner. Enjoyed the food thorough. Love the tomato soup, chicken wraps, mixed grill and so many more. A must go place.
5
A small eatery, but the food is excellent and staff were nice. Simple food fare, but the understanding in balance of flavor is that of an old school. Well done, happy to see such passion and conviction in the cooking.

Just returned from Pistachio today. What lovely flavours! I would rate the meal I had as one of the top three in Middle Eastern restaurants in all of the last 30 years. This comes as a surprise because this is a small corner in a plaza with no glamorous decor and you could easily walk past it without noticing it. I am surprised that the place was not busy. I have paid three times as much for meals that were not as good as this one.I would like to commend Agnes who took my booking over the phone and who also served me at the table for her gracious manner. I would also like to thank the chef Khaled who came to the table to chat with me and my wife. The dishes are all prepared fresh by him. He told me that he used to work at Shangri-La for a few years before opening his own place.I would recommend the mixed grill for two (for couples) and definitely try the fresh baked pita bread that comes steaming out of the oven with any dip
5
"Best" for me includes quality ingredients, functional & healthy foods (and a complete absence of toxic ingredients eg palm oil, MSG, synthetic sauces, high GI rice, pre packed processed ingredients), expertly and passionately made, unpretentious simple & sincere service....and ample free parking for the first 2 hours!Above all, a relationship of trust with Chef Khaleed who's philosophy on food is aligned with my own - a combination of amazing taste, health, value, abundance, culture....with the ingenuity and courage to change traditions only for the betterment of health and authentic taste.I have never before (and I have travelled widely as an airline crew) experienced this perfect marriage of Arabic - Mediterranean - Ayurvedic - Blood Type Diet cuisine that is both medicinal (preventive and healing) and delicious to the point of addiction!We love the advanced order items too: lamb shoulder, tomahawk and beef ribs!Don't let the "suitable for diabetic" chocolate lava cake (gluten & sugar free with 90%+ cacao) fool you...it is heavenly and addictive too...but my kids prefer the "original"!A true hidden gem in SG: 5* food, cafe prices, unpretentious and welcoming (even in my shorts), and served simply and sincerely by friends.After almost a year as regular diners, Pistachio is virtually our second home!My family really appreciates Chef Khaleed, his Wife Agnes and their loyal staff...we are most fortunate to have accidentally stumbled on this tiny corner. I am still in Paradise from this evening's lava cake!Bon appÃ©tit

Each time I go to this cafe, I wont have any disappointment but always feel shiok with its yummy food. Plus, the price is very reasonable with this kind of food quality. It is seldom to find such worth value of middle-east and mediterranean food in Singapore. The service is also good. Any food lover should not miss it

On the recommendation of friends, two friends and I went to Pistachio for lunch. It is a casual Middle Eastern restaurant in a shopping mall on Balestier Road. Had it not been so well recommended, I probably would not have tried it as I found the idea of a Middle Eastern restaurant in the middle of Zhongshan Mall to be a little incongruous. Having dined there, however, I will certainly go back and have no hesitation in recommending it. The food is ample: three of us shared pita bread (freshly baked) and eggplant dip, the meat platter for two (chicken and beef skewers plus two lamb chops served with a delicious rice pilaf with raisins and cashews) and a fabulous chocolate lava cake with ice cream. All the food was very fresh, nicely presented and of excellent quality. It's an honest place with a chef (whose credentials include Marriott, Four Seasons and Shangri-La) who strives for the best, with food, not atmosphere, clearly being what matters most to him. Atmosphere? Well, the kitchen is to one side and the seating area is basically in the atrium of the mall. One doesn't immediately recognize it as seating only for Pistachio -- one could mistake it for general seating for the various stalls and restaurants on that level. But once you're seated (we had booked in advance), the service and food are good and the knowledgeable staff is happy to describe the various dishes. As long as you understand that you aren't going to a fancy white tablecloth restaurant, there should be no complaints about the seating or the setting. It's an honest place with good value meals and a chef whose desire to serve healthy, wholesome and delicious food shines through

Food cooked with a lot of care and from the heart. Everything was done perfectly. We especially liked the Angus Beef bone-in ribs, sea food tagine, grilled praw ns & lamb chops. We were pleasantly surprised by the kind & generous gesture of the Chef who specially made a birthday chocolate lava cake for my daughter complete with lit candles and an additional Konaffa dessert to share for the rest of us! A lovely & memorable dining experience for us by the Chef, Agnes (the manager) & all the staff. Deeply appreciated from all of us

This visit, Khaled recommended us a special dish, something not found in his menu. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it - five large prawns stuffed with shrimps and minced squid meat. The accompanying broth cooked with vegetables, prawns and extra virgin olive oil was very light, tasty and refreshing. Mixing it with couscous was even better. Adding the home-made chilli was superb. You can taste a refreshing tinge of lime flavour in it. To truly enjoy the foods at Pistachio requires a degree of patience. The restaurant has limited capacity. Advanced booking is strong recommended to avoid disappointment. Your patience will be duly rewarded with the good foods served. Mr Khaled's dedication and his firm belief in using the fresh ingredients used were evident in the foods prepared by him. My kudos to him. The special dishes are not usual stuff seen in other restaurants. They are usually Mr Khaled's own creations from his years of experiences in the kitchen. Should you be interested to try some of his special dishes, please do give him a call so that he can prepare them in advance. You will not be disappointed! No words can aptly describe the foods we had at Pistachio. All I can say in plain language is that the food was just heavenly delicious!
5
I read some good reviews about Pistachio and wanted to try it out. All I can say is WOW! The food is definitely Michelin star quality and the chef and owner both came out and greeted us and had a friendly conversation as though we were old friends. We had the black mussels with garlic cream for an appetizer and a loaf of pita bread to soak up the sauce. Then we had the grilled beef tenderloin skewers and the lamb shank tagine, both with saffron rice on the side. Utterly stupendous!!Then Chef Khaled surprised us with some white and black chocolate dessert that was out of this world.We will definitely come back for more of this rare gem of a restaurant in Singapore
5
This is the most amazing Middle Eastern Restaurant, with amazing fresh food carefully prepared to the highest standards. I have travelled extensively including in Egypt and North Africa, Morocco, and this is by far the best !
5
Our dining experience was awesome... definitely be back for more... highly recommed... you guys wont be dissapoint with the food its absolutely amazing... service was friendly and we feel like home... tq pistachio restaurant you guys are the best...

a great and new Middle eastern restaurant at a quiet suburban mall...... Cheff Khalid....cooks food in a very unique and tasty way
5
We were introduced to Pistachio by friends and keep going back. Great food but get there early because the kitchen closes around 2100.
5
Great tasting food artistically presented, friendly staff with excellent personal service that is otherwise non-existent in Singapore, staff who consider it a pleasure and not work to serve you - easily has me going back as frequently as I can.

A friend recommended this relatively new restaurant that offers a range of Mediterranean and Middle East cuisines. Its location on the first floor of ZhongShan Mall is interesting, with casual dining area “al-fresco” café-style in the lobby area. My group of five decided to do it the “Asian style” to share our orderings, so that all of us can try out more dishes. We started off with the home-made Pita bread (served warm) with delicious Hummus dip. For the mains, we had the Mixed Grill (Adana kebab, chicken & lamb-chop were nicely flavoured and served with saffron rice and salad, Lahim Kebab (which is grilled beef tenderloin skewers marinated with olive oil and spices) and vegetarian pizza. All great freshly prepared food served by friendly staff, and glad that I had room for the dessert. The freshly baked Hot Chocolate Lava Cake with ice cream was a heavenly knock-out and not too sweet – perfect way to finish a great dinner. Chef Khaled, who used to be with many 5-stars hotels, also came out to talk to the diners and making sure all is order – nice touch. Pistachio Grill is open for lunch and dinner, and for those drive, ZhongShan Mall allows two hours of free parking

After reading through the reviews & going through the menu, I decided to bring my wife to Pistachio for our wedding anniversary dinner. It was our 1st time having a complete Middle Eastern Mediterranean meal. I was intrigued by the varieties in the menu. We ordered the Pistachio Salad, Tomato Soup, Cheese Garlic Pita to go with Hummus. Lamb Chop Tagine with Couscous for 2, Turkish Coffee & of course, dessert. With my humble understanding of Middle Eastern culture I knew that the Hummus & the Tagine were a must try. I always have this belief the simplest dishes determines the Chef's skills & passion. What caught us off guard was the serving portion was generous. Every item were bursting with freshness & there were no traces of artificial flavouring. The salad dressing is flavourful yet not too acidic. I was surprised when Chef Khaled told me the dressing is yoghurt based not egg yolk. The Pita has the aroma of freshly roasted flour. The Tagine blew us off. My wife usually don't like rice for it's starchiness but she gave her 2 thumbs up for the couscous finished a substantial portion of it. We could taste the meat juices and the spices in the couscous. The Turkish coffee was also out of the world. It was so refined, robust yet not acidic. We even had some fun with Chef Khaled when he related to us the Turkish culture of fortune telling using the coffee sediment after drinking. Every single detail from flavour to presentation were not missed. We were very very impressed with Chef Khaled's hospitality. After some chit chat we found out that Chef Khaled was a former Executive Chef with a top notch 5 star hotel heading the Mediterranean section. We were also educated about the health benefits of Mediterranean food.This is 5 star food from a 5 star Chef. Before I forget to mention, his staff are just as professional. I usually don't write reviews let alone this detailed. Hope this review do some justice for this gem of Middle Eastern Mediterranean Cuisine in Singapore

Our family of five had a wonderful experience when we dined at Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill​. We didn't expect such a small restaurant could actually deliver such fine authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. The husband and wife team of Agnes and Khaled as well as their two staff were meticulous in their service delivery. This may not be surprising considering Agnes had formerly left a well-paying job in the hospitality industry to venture in this restaurant while Khaled had extensive exposure working in reputable hotels & restaurants around the world. We did not make a booking, thinking it would not be a problem on a Tuesday. Wrong ! All tables were fully booked and we had to wait a good one and a half hours before we could be accommodated. Why did we bother to wait so long? Well, first, Agnes was most courteous and kept reassuring us that she would clear a table as soon as one was available. Second, we had heard about the great grilled meat & kebabs that Pistachio was well known for. We just had to try it - and we were not disappointed ! Khaled displayed great finesse when carving the meat and the beef tenderloin skewers and grilled marinated lamb chops were just out of this world! Despite the heavy work load, the couple still found time to mingle with their customers as they would at home. I found this personal touch to service so refreshing where none exists these days. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening as we not only had great outstanding food but were also entertained by such a wonderful couple as Agnes & Khaled. As I now live in Australia, I will most certainly make it a point to visit Pistachio on my next trip to Singapore. But I will be sure to make a booking this time

Introduced and brought to this most excellent place by a good friend for lunch. We had the Tomahawk steak and roasted potatoes as mains, exceptionally delicious, tender and tasty, followed by the chocolate lava cakes. Out of this world! The attention to detail and passion that Chef Khaled puts into his creations shows in the great flavours and perfect dishes that came out of the kitchen. Great service by Agnes and her wait team. Will definately be back for more good and wholesome food from this fabulous place. The Egyptian pastry dessert special was also a must try....just beautiful and bursting with floral flavours without being sickly sweet. A most fabulous afternoon.
5
We had Chef Khaled prepare us the bone-in beef ribs, it was beautifully cooked with a delicate spicy sauce rubbed over the ribs. This was served in a bed of very delicious Middle Eastern spiced rice and garnished with sultanas, cashew nuts and fried shallots for our Chinese New Year dinner! You have to try his very yummy dips too that are served with the most amazing pita bread! Again prepared in the traditional way, and fresh. 3 different dips and I love them all. We have also tried their other dishes and they are all highly recommended. They have no alcohol licence, but didn't mind us bringing our own. Enjoy

A classy middle eastern food.
Fluffy rice and I like its mix grilled and cheesy mussel.
Is a great place to held a birthday celebration, as the Chef will complement you with a desert for the birthday boy.
5
Simply delicious food served with a heart from the lovely couple team running this gem tucked in a corner at Balestier. Tried most food on the menu and on every occasion, never fails to delight me and my friends. A definite must try, Black Mussels, Lebanese Platter, Tomahawk, pita bread with humus, chocolate lava cake, just to name a few. Go try them all, you will simply be amazed. Thank you Chef Khaled and Agnes

Dining at Pistachio is both a satisfying and fulfilling experience!!! Every morsel resonated positive vibes from the first moment I tasted their food and in an instant, I knew that the Chef adhered to the highest and strictest standards of culinary practice. Indeed, Chef Khaled is someone who accumulated years of experience in his commitment to providing healthy, nutritious and wholesome food based on Ayurvedic principles without the use of any form of additives, preservatives and heavily processed sauces and condiments. As such, eating at Pistachio not only delights my senses but makes me feel nourished from within.Recently, I was really thankful that Chef Khaled agreed to cook for my gathering of 50 family members during the first day of the Lunar New Year. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food which consisted of Baked Whole Chickens and Premium Angus Ribs on a bed of saffron rice, Black Mussels in garlic cream, with garlic bread and Grilled King Prawns. All the ingredients used were really fresh and of excellent quality. And to create an alternative to the usual raw fish Yusheng which the Chinese toss for good luck, Chef Khaled ingeniously created a cous cous dessert with mixed nuts and various raisins which my family and I tossed for bountiful blessings and good fortune, according to Moroccan tradition and belief. Everything wrapped up nicely with a cup of Moroccan mint tea for all.Lastly, on behalf of my family, I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to Chef Khaled, Agnes and the entire team at Pistachio for putting their complete dedication to providing excellent and wholesome comfort food for all my guests. It certainly put a smile on all their faces and brightened their day!!!!Cheers,Darren Lo

This was our second visit and on this ocassion we had the mouth watering Tomahawk steak with roast potatoes. For starters we had freshly baked pitta and humus. Chef Khaled carved the meat for our party and he was extremely courteous and friendly. Pistachio restaurant has not got the license to serve alcohol but we brought our own favourite bottle and four wine glasses! The food and service was great and we had a fabulous dinner with best friends. The ambience of the place may not be quite what one may expect but that did not marr the evening for us one little bit. Will definitely return to try Chef Khaled's other yummy dishes
5
It's local mall and no Ambulance whatsoever, great staff great people and amazing food. But expensive for where there located but amazing amazing food. A must in my opinion
5
Food was excellently cooked by Chef Khaled. The tomahawk steak was to die for !! Agnes and her staff were every attentive. We enjoyed ourselves tremendously and only hope they will have a nicer environment to serve their delicious food in the near future
5
How can I not love ❤️ this place? How can I not love you guys ! You serve the most savouring dishes. My Father was so impressed with the food tonite and the children really enjoyed the tomato soup, pita , mussels and of course the lava dessert! It's been a long time since we've had a happy reunion dinner as a result of enjoying the good food and service. Chef Khaled and Agnes , its been our pleasure

Sharing Secrets Is So Hard To Do....However, this eatery is too good not to share..... located at 20 Ah Hood Road, Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill is the place where foodies will satisfy their cravings for well prepared food that is cooked with the perfect balance of herbs and spices which accentuates the taste of the meats. The meats are juicy, tender and fall off the bone! The restaurant is a cosy and humble set up tucked away in Zhongshan Mall but the food speaks volumes of the passion of Chef Khaled Elelimi. Introduced by a friend who is a regular customer, (patronising the joint at least once a month) and she organised this dinner of a party of 12 this evening, 16 January 2017. It was evident that all of us enjoyed every morsel from all our clean plates at the end of each dish! Dessert was another story.. even those without a sweet tooth, found theirs! The chocolate lava cake was one of the best I've tried and I consider myself a chocoholic! Well, now that this secret is out, I hope it won't be too hard to get a table next time soon. Perhaps an off peak period during week day lunch will be best to have a leisurely meal and savour more items on the menu. For obvious reasons, terms are cash or Nets. Definitely no regrets taking time off my hectic schedule to finally have a scrumptious meal. Compliments to the Chef for his superb culinary skills and to the staff for excellent service!
5
The place served authentic Mediterranean food and we could taste the sincerity of the chef in making every dish. From the pita bread to the hummus to the couscous and the Shawama. The chef really delivered dishes worth his experience. It is an honour to taste food of the man who served dignitaries. The manager was also very friendly and professional. We would definitely return and highly recommend the place. And the place don't charge service charge and GST. :
5
This was my 4th time to the restaurant, and each experience never fails to impress. Every single item ordered was beautifully delicious. And the passion of cooking from Chef Khaled can be felt in his foods and service to the customers. Thank you Chef Khaled and Agnes for your hard work, and bringing excellent meat dishes into Singapore!
5
We tried a little bit of everything in the menu and it was all good. A very good option of arabic food in Singapore. Prices are ok.
5
We really enjoyed the food. Mr Khaled took the effort to meet his customers. The small setting gives it a special touch and feel. The service is friendly and prompt. We will definitely come back again for mouth-watering delicious food!
5
First of all, thank you for the wonderful evening of good food. Seldom have I come across such delicious food!! The food was really awesome and authentic. People just got try the Tomahawk to believe it!!!I really wonder why will anyone will give a thumb down to this restaurant? Either the person is a spoilt brat or a Self Entitled Person to give such a bad review. Thank goodness I tried the food. If not for the awful person's review I might have missed all these wonderful food!! Something must be wrong with the person giving the bad review if there is 100 excellent and 1 thumb down. Shrug

My family and I decided to go and try out Pistachio restaurant after we were searching for Mediterranean cuisine and found this place recommended in the internet. We were definitely very satisfied with the food and the cozy atmosphere there. The restaurant specialise in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Our main dish was the Pistachio Mix Grill and Greek Moussaka. They are very excellent. They meats are tender and the saffron rice is very very nice. Later, we try their Black Mussels cooked with garlic and it is just lovely. The owner and chef came out later and chat with us. From our conversation, this former Shangri-La Hotel's chef plus owner really have a great passion for his food. He explained to us about the way he try to cook the food in a healthy manner and also very strict on the quality of the supplies he received. This is definitely the right place to go if you are looking for an authentic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. The prices are are also very reasonable. Personally, I felt eating in a very homely environment. Highly recommended

If you are staying somewhere along Balestier Road or visiting someone in TTS Hospital, this little gem in Zhongshan Mall is a delightful find. If you only have the main course and share a salad at lunchtime the bill would be $20 or so. We had the mussels in cream sauce with garlic and chilli and the Lebanese platter which had delicately spiced basmati with two skewers of nicely marinaded chicken cubes and a side salad. The house salad of baby spinach and finely chopped red peppers and slices of cucumber with a light mayonnaise - may have been yoghurt dressing was nicely refreshing. After we had Mint tea, Turkish coffees and a baklava for desert the bill came up to $64 for two. This is not quite a destination eatery as there is not much ambience since seating is sort of outside the cafe under the escalators. Service is satisfactory. I like it a tad friendlier but it was polite and efficient which is a good start. Next time we go, we will try the mezes and the mixed grill which was presented quite dramatically on three hanging skewers above a bed of rice. The dinner menu is different from lunch. More variety and expect to pay more per head.
5
Had the chicken kebab. Well seasoned and juicy. Came with a nice salad with yoghurt dressing. The accompanying bowl of pilaf rice was just a little dry for me. A bit of gravy would be great but that's probably not authentic...Being greedy, I ordered the baklava with ice cream. I was left scrapping everything off the plate, just short of licking it clean.
5
This is definitely the place to go for Middle Eastern food. My hubby and I went to Pistachio for a second time and were still craving for more. The quality of the food is superb and the price is reasonable. The Chef himself was one hospitable guy who would come out of the kitchen to greet and talk to diners. Thank you Chef Khaled for bringing the authentic flavor of Middle Eastern cuisine into this part of Singapore. We can't wait to try the rest of the menu
5
Had a wonderful meal at the Pistachio Grill (Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill). Chef Khaled's ability to combine healthy food with a contemporary twist of international cuisine and with nutritional goodness - always never fail to please. Food was artistically presented and served with the utmost elegance even for a small-sized restaurant like this.Our friends & I had the most amazing and unforgettable experience dining at Pistachio Grill
5
Met Khaled at the market and was introduced to this little corner place of his. Really nice food and friendly staff. The spaghettl aglio olio with king prawns was fantastic. A mix of Italian and Middle Eastern taste with 2 huge prawns cut into half. The cream base for the black mussels was fantastic. Khaled himself cam to say hello and was presented with 2 complimentary desserts which surprised us. Oh the chocolate lava was so delicious. Was told by him 95% chocolate and 5% flour. Not too sweet, just nice. Will definitely go back and try something else. Thank you Khaled
5
The food is amazing. Khaled worked at the Shangri-la restaurant for years and opened this small, charming and delectable restaurant. You will not be disappointed. The service is great. We had the baba ganoush with pomegranate seeds, humus and the grilled platter for two. The spices he uses are fired up in small batches and grinds so that it flavors the meats. We were treated with the white chocolate lava cake which was just divine. Dark chocolate lava cake wasn't fantastic either. I am definitely going back and bringing all my foodie friends. A must try
