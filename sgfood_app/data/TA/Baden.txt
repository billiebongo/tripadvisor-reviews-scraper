Pleasant bar to chill at, with happy hour till 11pm! However, the cashier made a mistake in the prices and claimed that the price in the menu has not been updated. Nvtl, service is good, beer is great!

A lot of choices in Holland Village. I ended up here once with a big group of friends. The services was OK. The sitting was not too bad. The drinks served cold that's all we wanted.

Haven't been here for a while and the menu seemed to change especially the pork knuckle . I love the old ways of cooking pork knuckles instead of having the sauces made specially on other bowl. I loved to have the sauces of the meat soak with knuckles together . It tasted crispy outside and moisture inside.. somehow it has changed the Chef... ordered the five types sausages and tasted just as great. Happy Hour beer is one for one ! Good value and good ambience . Convenient location at Holland village near to Holland village MRT station. Great place to hangout with friends and cheap beer. One for one .. worth it. Enjoy dining

Went for dinner.Very crowded, and happening location, and not far from MRT.Nice beers and foods!!! We ordered Baden Feast Platter and loved every thing on the plate!! Pork knuckle was crispy and juicy!!! Music slightly loud inside, so we chose to sit outside. :

Met some work colleagues here for dinner before flying out last week and it was a blast! The beer was cold, fresh, and plentiful! Contrary to some of the other reviews on here, I found the service to be fantastic! The wait staff were on their game all night long. And the food!!!! Sausages, sauerkraut, pork, the works... Very good!

I have visited this restaurant few times before and this is the worst experience I ever had. Service is bad, the waiters just cannot be bothered. Ordered sausage platter and have to wait fifteen minutes for a plate of cold sausage. Ordered fries which at least came hot but when we asked for mayonnaise, the waiter says need to pay $2 which we just ignore him (in the end this was not charged). It is such a pity - beer is one for one till 9pm, the restaurant has a lively feel which reminds me of Europe but the service and cold food just makes it bad. Great disappointment. There are much better German restaurants around

They have good and reasonably priced 1 for 1 beer specials which is great but unfortunately the service can be quite bad. I have been here several times and the service has been consistently slow and sub-standard. The last time I went there we were there in a group of 4 and had gone there for drinks. We sat down literally outside the counter and although the place wasn't super busy we waited for more than 10 minutes without anyone coming to give us menus or take our orders. I decided to go up to the staff and told them that we were leaving because we had not received any service at all. I was more shocked at his reaction when he nonchalently said "ok". I will not be going back

Price of the beer was fantastic at happy hour, costing half of what we'd usually pay elsewhere (but still probably more expensive than in Germany).Loved the currywurst, but we got tired of the pork knuckles pretty quickly. Service was slow as they seemed shorthanded, so don't come if you're in a rush

Recommended by my friend, tried the Pork Knucle and sausage very tasty. But Services was average, because the waiter seem a bit rush for taking order, we have not done our order, then he just left. We been calling 5-6 times waiter to order drinks and food. As for the drink, One for One before 9pm a little bit messy, they come for wrong size and create misunderstanding. But overall, this is still recommended

Food is great but service is terrible! We ordered both soup and main course but didn't know that we could upgrade to a set meal. When asked, this guy Bryan said that we didn't ask and a set meal is not recommended. As a waiter/waitress, you should give your customers options to upgrade to a set meal instead of saying that it's optional and not recommended.

This bar peddles ridiculously overpriced beers, has the worst customer service ever, and the food is very disappointing. Basically, this place sucks.

The curry wurst looked different from the typical curry wurst we had from other restaurants but it turned out to be very tasty. The sausages were chopped into smaller pieces and immersed in a plate of delicious curry sauce. The schnitzel is crispy and taste is just right. It would have been perfect if the meat is slightly thicker.Overall I think it's value for money with the good service from the staff. I would strongly recommend to anyone who wish to spend a German evening :

Went to this restaurant last night at around 7pm and it was already starting to get busy. All staff were very friendly and helpful in suggesting things for us to order. What I love about this place is their 1-for-1 pint beers for $10 (5$ each). Overall great food and great beer. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a social atmosphere with music

Service was good and fast. Portions are small for the price that we paid. I had much better German food, it was not really good in Baden in my opinion. At the end we had some misunderstanding with the bill and they sent out this huge guy, who looked like a bouncer at a club. Even if it was our fault with the bill (which we admitted and apologized) it doesn't justify how terribly rude this "manager" was. Terrible rude and screaming at us. And not only at us but at the staff as well. 100% not going back there and not only because of the screaming, but also cause it its just not worth it in general

Got to admit, orders come fast. Food is ok to go through as German food if you have stayed in Asia long enough. If you directly come from Germany, don't expect a lot. Sizes were small (5 WÃ¼rste Platter as well as Baden curry wurst). Brezel half the size of a real one, additionally not fresh, but oven-freshed, quite stale. Yet, if you are craving German food and got some dollars left, you might give it a try. Recommend under certain circumstances. Don't miss the happy hour (two beer for one), because that gave us the guts for one star higher

Been goingbthere for a year now but dont think I'll put a step into the place again. The boss was rude to his staff and brought in take-away pizza! When we asked if that was acceptable practice the boss came over and said arrogantky he was the boss and was having his dinner. The entire table of guests were gorging down the takeaways. The staff is very gracious but work fearfully of the over controlling boss. I can't change the views of every customers but I won't be going there again until there is a change of management

I used to go to this place frequently many years ago when I lived in Singapore. During a visit now I thought I'd come back and enjoy some good German food. Boy has this place changed. First of all, the service staff ignored me for a full 10 minutes before one of them threw a menu in front of me without saying anything. The Erdinger draft arrived swiftly, but that was the only good thing this evening. The three of us ordered Schnitzel, Currywurst and cheese sausages. A photo of the Currywurst is attached to this review. It was tasteless sauce (certainly no curry flavor in there) and a very thin sausage that tasted like cardboard. The Schnitzel was so so and the cheese sausages were hard, overcooked, full of fat and rather tasteless. Prior to coming here, I had tried to call the restaurant to make a reservation - I tried five times at different hours, but nobody bothered to pick up the phone. Bottom line: the only thing you can do here is drink beer. Don't hope for service and don't eat anything. Very sad, because it used to be so good back then..

After been to many places for beer, I think I still like here.They have both the beers I usually drink Heineken and Erdinger..And they usually have happy hour and can mix Erdinger White 7 Dark.But I am a white fan. So it is recommended to go if you are in groups and are Erdinger lover..

Had an opportunity to grab a bite to eat in Singapore and we searched for a little variety. We found it. This is a denizen attempt at a German eatery complete with minimal outdoor seating. Pros include a decent variety of German beers and dishes, a late (9pm) happy hour as well as an extensive local mixed drink selection. Cons, however, outweighs pros in this review. To begin, seating is very limited, so arrive early to dine on site or expect to wait. Second, the waitstaff is two employees, who excel at menu distribution and writing your order down. In their defense, they are advertising for labor, and its necessity is evident. Menu suggestions are limited, if at all, and delays between sitting, ordering and the check were encountered. I ordered the three-sausage variety (beef, pork, chicken or lamb) platter which arrived hot and flavorful. It was accompanied by a potato-ish side and what tasted like sauerkraut. Granted, I was searching for something different and it was edible, but cost was a little high, portions were a little small and the experience a little long. Doubt I will return, but worth the try

Went to here for midweek dinner and a few beers with work colleague and his wife. Food was quite average overall (pork knuckle was quite good while the potatoes were too oily). Erdinger wheat beer on tap which during happy hour is a good deal and served in proper weissbier glasses. What was really annoying was when we were halfway through our meal the staff disrupted our dinner and demanded payment. Their excuse was that happy hour was over and now they have to collect for everything. Very annoying
