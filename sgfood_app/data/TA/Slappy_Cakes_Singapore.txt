Spent my birthday morning here... we had 5 people and ordered 3 bottles of mix. Fun to create your own design. For non-Singqpore people, the waiters seemed hesitant to serve us. Tried the lavender lemonade. Interesting!
5
This a restaurant where you get to make your own food, and it's fun! The price is nice, and you get to have fun while making and enjoying your food!
4
Make your own pancakes right at the table - cost and quality was reasonable and was easy to walk in and get a seat straight away
Service was good and quick
Situated centrally in shopping centre within short distance of hotels
5
My daughter love to cook pancake by herself let alone of making it in some fun ways. She will try to make pictures and wording with the batter. It is fun and delicious pan cake. But other food are just ok.
5
We went here for a 15 man team bonding. Its fun la. I recommend for family with kids tthough. Location taste and creativity is good
5
Opens from 8am so it's perfect for early risers! Make Your Own Pancakes here. Lovely place, and the staff are sweet and wonderful. The buttermilk batter is the best!
4
Fun place for kids as they get to make their very own pancake creations. There are several different batter to choose (buttermilk, peanut butter, chocolate, pandan, whole grain), with a number of sauces/spread and toppings.Other than pancakes, there are other options: salad, steak, pasta and the likes. Not big in variety but it's sufficient. Taste-wise the food is pretty good.Great ambience, great service. Extra point for providing free ice/hot water, free flow, self-service.The bad side is the small space on the table, as most of it is taken up by the frying pan
4
Fun Fun Fun. The deco was simple with a stove in the middle of the table. The kids had a blast making their own pancakes & came up with weird strange shapes and concoction of different pancakes. They had a good breakfast menu consisting of other items of eggs, bacon, sausages etc., as well. We had great fun and would recommend this for a good day out.
4
My children are fussy eaters and pretty much only eat Italian food of junk food. We didn't have the pancakes as I feel that when I'm on holidays I don't need to cook!My girls both had pasta and enjoyed it so much we went back for lunch another day.If we were to visit Sentosa again we would eat here again
1
Avoid this place at all cost. Service is shocking. Only reason I go there is because kids enjoy making pancakes. It we ready to have crap service where waiting time for food takes longer than the titanic been raised from ocean floor. Every experience is a nightmar
5
Make your own pancakes a novel idea. Lots of fillings and for the parents excellent eggs Benedict and scrambled eggs!
4
This is our third visit and the kids love the DIY pancakes. We never get bored of this place as we will always find new pancakes to create! Simple fun and pleasures. Overall a good experience!
1
A great place for the kids- they had fun creating there own pancakes, but service was terrible. We ordered the pancakes and 2 x cooked breakfasts for our family. 1 cooked breakfast came out then 35mins later after everyone else at table had finished eating the other cooked breakfast came out which tasted disgusting- gooey sloppy scrabbled eggs that were cold and probably sitting in the kitchen waited to be bought out the whole 35mins of waiting. Very disappointed With a total of $95 it's a absolute waste with the service we receive
5
Slappy cakes was not only a tonne of fun, but the pancakes were really tasty. Hubby and I came here before heading to universal for the day. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. I think the fun factor helped there though. The lemon curd was also to die for. Will 100% dream about coming back here for more pancake goodnes
3
We come here for breakfast and try their specialty of making our own pancakesWe choose chocolate and buttermilk as our pancake batter and top up with some topping such as banana, choc chips, almond and whipped cream.The idea is quite interesting as we can make and decorate our own pancake right on our dining table and most importantly is quite safe for kids to cook (with parents supervision)
2
We waited 55 minutes for a table when there were plenty of empty tables (check out my pic) They just took forever to be cleaned. They had just two staff looking after the whole dining area (including taking orders). We waited as we had promised the kids but saw loads of people just walk away (and I really wanted to). Management needs to step in and ensure enough staff! I'll think twice before coming back here again which is a shame!
3
Go to slappy cakes only if you want to make your own pancakes. The food is expensive, average at best, and the coffee is bad. The service is also poor. They have a button at each table to call for service, and after pressing it, no one came. We saw our table number highlighted at a board after we pressed the button, but the servers were just hanging around and talking. Also, part of the dining area became a store room. You have stacks of drinks stacked up at one side. Also, a server was drying cutlery in the midst of the dining area, and just about one feet from a diner. Making your own pancakes can be a fun thing to do with your kids, but go there only if you want to do that
4
Shutter buses from clementi, toa payoh and sixth avenue mrt. Unless you're driving, those shutter buses are great! The squeeze bottles of batter is at $8.50 each. We had peanut butter and buttermilk. Toppings are added on for about $1.50-$3 I think. They have things like chocolate chips, Bacon, chocolate spreads, fruits. The photo we took shows strawberries, white choc chips, Bacon bits and pork sausage. 2 bottles were sufficiently filling for 2And it was fun to make the pancakes, especially when it didn't burn that easily~ Would definitely go back.
4
Slappy Cakes is unique restaurant that lets you make your own delicious pancake creation, complete with all kinds of toppings. The tables are set with a “baker” in the middle where you can “slap” on your pancakes and see it cook in front of your very eyes. Kids will love this.This restaurant is located within Resorts World Sentosa near the USS entrance
2
I took my son here for what I hoped would be a quick dinner after a playdate at Fidgets. The restaurant was empty but they sat us in a corner and basically forgot about us the entire time. Whenever I needed something (i.e to order or get the bill), I had to physically get up and walk to the cashier. Food was okay
2
I would not worry about going here! The service was poor as they slapped the batter on our table loudly. It was really expensive too! Don't go to slappy cakes!!!!!!
3
Had pancakes galore. Good mix of things to add to them.
The children loved the cooking of their own special concoctions and a stress free time was had. Service okay, could be a little quicker. Coffee good. Buttermilk pancake mix was also good.
4
It was our first time in Slappy Cakes and it was quite a different experience. You get to make your pancakes yourself, there's a small hot plate in the centre of the table and you can order your batter and toppings/fillings and make them yourself.They have Ala Carte menu too but it's fun to make the pancakes, we had great fun.It's quite a cool place; located in the resort world Sentosa
5
Got a teeny bit overexcited when we came across this place, pancakes are a firm favourite in our house & to find a restaurant where you get to make your own was amazing! It's such a brilliant idea & I wish we had these types of places in the UK. (If they're here I haven't found them) We visited with our 5 year old who loved it, and it's so simple that she could actually join in with the cooking & making. It's a real family friendly place & the staff were helpful - although you only really need them to bring you the pancake elements, you do the rest. I love that there's a little 'ring for service' bell on the table, that was useful. We had peanut butter & butter milk batter which were both great. The bottles make about 4/5 decent sized pancakes & the topping portions are generous too. It was so much fun & would definitely recommend a visit!
5
We were 2 families for 4 each with 2 adults n 2 kids in each Family . We had 4 bottles of batter and loads of toppings along with 2 portions of eggs cooked various style. We paid $70. Per familly which is great esp in sentosa . Super lunch filling Recommended their lavender honey, eggs Benedict with vegies . Loved it .
4
Visited the Turf City branch for dinner during weekends. I know... why pancakes for dinners?? They actually serve other food like all-day breakfast, main courses like chicken chop, fish, lamb too. My kids love the cabonara too. The pancake bottles come in 5 flavours, we took the buttermilk and chocolate. Other flavors include peanut butter, pandan. Each bottle cost $8. Toppings are charged extra ranging from $1.50-$3.00 for both savory (turkey ham..etc) and sweet (whipped cream..etc). The kids had plenty of fun creating their own pancakes. The pan is hot but not sizzling hot so its pretty safe. No oily splatters too. Pancake tastes great. Chocolate is the best.Highly recommended for families with children
4
An interesting family dining experience where you choose your type of pancake batter and some toppings or additions and cook your own pancakes on a hot plate on the table. It was good fun and the pancakes were tasty but I did not find it great value
3
The kids had great fun creating their own pancakes. We didn't try their main courses as we already had lunch before heading there. It was an experience for the kids! Do go there on a non peak period as we had to wait 45 min before getting a table (we ended up going somewhere else for lunch before heading back for the pancakes fun)
4
Main course (dory fish) is good, worth the price. Signature dish is pancake with different taste with different topping and syrup that you can cook on the table by yourself. Water are self service by the bar. Unfortunately, they cannot do exchange the side dish of main course. We wanted to order the lamb, but would like to exchange the rice with potatoes or others, but they cannot
1
Don't bother to try all day breakfast at RWS. Discription written on the menu was not even 50% similar to what is brought to your table. Roasted chicken quesadilla was burn and horribly bitter. Potato soup serve with roasted potato chunk , leek and onion. Nothing was found in the room temperature soup. I suppose that's their way of serving room temperature soup. Oh well. Mushroom scrambles was so dry up and making me wonder if it's cook by a chefs or the service crews.Their service was the worse I had ever experienced. The manager ignore my feedback and simply walk way and chat with the female crew.At least heat up my soup and serve it properly.Not a single service recovery was done and I even need to walk over to them and ask for the bill
3
A cool experience but service was just ok. We walked out wondering why we had paid to make our own food, haha.
5
We loved this little place and ate there twice in a week while on sentosa. The kids loved making their own pancakes and then adding all the toppings etc. it is quite expensive but it is fun.
2
Went in for breakfast before Universal opened, got a table and waited 30-40 minutes whilst everyone around us was served... walked out in disgrace.
5
My Family enjoyed being creative with the shape of the Pancakes. Playing with your food takes on a whole new meaning here. :-)
4
Though it's a lot of fun and the pancakes turn out to be great I personally thought the place was very over-priced, especially the add ons on the menu such as the fruits, cheeses and even syrups were more expensive than I had thought!
2
There's nothing else really for breakfast. The kids will love the amount of choice to add to their pancakes, and the options will satisfy some adults as well. But if you want something a bit more interesting (and honestly, tasty), this is not the place. The Turkey Bacon (never a good choice in the first place, but...) was tasteless, rubbery, and even my 7 year old thought it looked like something out of a kids kitchen play set. Avoid unless you have no choice.
1
The quality is minimal at best and the service is shocking. Visited the one on Sentosa and there was no acknowledgement they got the order wrong but it appeared to be a hilarious joke to all the staff that they had and an inconvenience to the waitress.
2
They insisted that the baked potato was a real potato. But it was sweet potato. I hate sweet potato because of its texture and taste. They insisted that it was potato. I asked for rice instead but they said they couldn't do that. To make up for it they said they'll just bring me a salad. And they brought me a sad excuse for a salad. It was horrible!
5
The first time we went to Slappy Cakes was in Portland, OR, which is about 3 hours drive from where we live. We were so happy to find that Slappy Cakes had a branch in Singapore and since we return every Christmas to visit family, we have eaten at Slappy Cakes every year for the past few years. The food is pretty much the same in the US as in SIngapore except for the toppings where some differ. Our latest visit was at the Universal Studios branch and we ate there before entering the park. Love the food and the fun
4
Came here with some friends and the children. The kids had so much fun as they made the pancakes. Since I don't like pancakes, I could also order food from the menu. The food portions being American are gigantic and greasy - think American diners! The toast is also so big. Tip - can make the Kids share the pancake mix as they didn't finish everything by themselves
4
Came to the Grandstand outlet for supper. Ordered the butter and chocolate batter. Girls figured out how to play straight away, and did lots of fun shapes. Great place to spend some time and have fun. Strongly recommended.
4
It was worth doing once, just for the heck of it. Nothing great or original about the taste to take us back there again. The kids enjoyed the novelty.
5
Amazing concept. Loved the fact you can totally create what you want and cook it yourself. Kids loved it. Tastes were brilliant - the ingredients high quality. The staff were chatty and friendly.
Hope they bring this idea to the UK!
4
near the entrance of Universal studios, one of the few genuine pancake eateries we observed, plenty of choice, fair pricing but rent would be a lot, a nice touch to the area.
3
We stopped at the Slappy Cakes restaurant for a quick lunch. We had just Ceaser's salad, Chicken wrap and mocktails which were all good. The service was quick and the prices moderate. A novelty of the restaurant is that you can bake your pancakes on your table. But we didn't try that
5
Slappy cakes is a great fun idea for everyone to enjoy. A place to enjoy pancakes with family or friends, where you can choose your own flavors and add-ons and then have the fun of making them yourself at your table.  A great concept which was entertaining and filling. A good choice of flavours and also add-ons from healthy to chocolate etc. The staff were excellent, very helpful, friendly and patient. A place that will certainly be visited again
5
We really enjoyed our meals at Slappy Cakes, we visited 3 times while on holiday and every time cooked a different variety of pancake or had a hot breakfast. It was fun to pour the batter out in to different shapes and watch it cook in front of you .This was one of the only restaurants that served hot tea in a pot (sorry) but desperate after 10 days.. The staff were helpful and friendly, there are jugs of free cold water too
4
We walked past and couldn't resist popping in once we'd seen that you make your own pancakes right in front of you on the table hot plate! We couldn't resist giving it a go! You buy a 8oz bottle of mixture which costs $8.50 then you buy your toppings, we got chocolate spread, white chocolate chips and raspberry jam plus a sprite and a beer the total cost was $30 (about Â£15) which we didn't think was bad! The only thing I kinda forgot in the excitement is that I'm crap at making pancakes so they probably weren't the best pancakes but that's all my fault ha! We got about 6-7 small pancakes out of each bottle, we only got one bottle to share as we didn't need loads to eat.The service was spot on, the waitress even put my phone on charge for me as it was dying and I wanted to take more photos! I'd definitely recommend it!
3
Children get to hon their artistic skills when making a pancake. Food was ok. The exception was the carbonara which was great. However service was mediocre as we had to get staff to help clear table. We went in a group of 4 adults and 2 children but were given a small table. However, for a Friday evening, the place was quite empty. Gone are the days for great service
5
Ate at the branch outside universal studios. Loved the choice of pancake batters in squeezy bottles and wide range of sweet and savoury toppings. Great fun to make our own pancakes. Kids and husband both enjoyed making different combinations of pancakes, from strawberries and chocolate chips, to mushrooms fried in the pancakes, as well as making shapes. All round, a great experience which I strongly recommend!Note: I recommend only getting two/three bottles of batter, as we had too much left over after ordering four for 1 adult and 3 kids
5
What a fabulous idea. A table with a hot plate to make your own pancakes. There are different flavoured batter (eg butter milk and chocolate). You choose your own toppings and then off you go and make your own designs. Plenty of food, not expensive and a great experience for all.
5
We decided to have pancakes before entering Universal Studios, and we tried Slappy Cakes pancakes. You get to make your own pancakes on the griddle in front of you. There are many batters to choose from, and you can choose from different toppings to decorate. My son loved creating his own pancakes, and we were able to swirl different patterns into them, or write our names in pancake mixture.Very reasonably priced, and a unique way of having breakfast. Actually they are delicious any time of day.
4
If you have children ages 6 and above, this would be a great place for you to have breakfast or brunch in the weekend. First off, you can choose between 5 pancake batter (Peanut butter, chocolate, whole grain, zucchini and buttermilk). After choose your sweet and savory toppings.Once the food arrive, you can make and cook your own pancakes. Have fun making unique creations
4
We visited the outlet on Sentosa. An expensive but fun way to have pancakes - definitely somewhere that kids will enjoy!It was the first time I'd seen anywhere like this so I enjoyed it. It is quite a small space so only suitable for four to six people. We had four adults and two kids and there were only two tables suitable for that size, but the staff kindly moved us over to the bigger table once it was available
4
We went to the outlet at Sentosa. I did not think that it will be fun but it was. We had lots of fun drawing/making pancakes. The breakfast set that we ordered is not that nice. Just keep to the pancakes and sides. Although it was fun, we felt that it is too expensive for pancakes. For us, only good enough for a one time visit
5
Wow!! Do you love pancakes for breakfast?? Well at this place you have a little hotplate on your table and you get to cook your own...so fun. The idea is to order the batter you want, the fillings and toppings and you just go for it. I loved it!! But, they don't do real cream or ice-cream...just so you know :
5
For a bit of fun, my sister and I went to Slappy Cakes on Sentosa Island for breakfast on our last day. It is a clever concept, a way to make and enjoy your breakfast (though you are bound to have oily hands afterwards - luckily there is a washroom just outside, next door!).We ordered two bottles of batter ($8.50 each) - buttermilk and wholemeal so we could make pictures, with dark and light batter. we went crazy with the side dishes too ($4 each) as we ordered raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and chocolate chips. For savoury we ordered brie cheese, mushrooms, and pork sausages. We also had lemon curd and whipped cream as toppings. The only complaint I had was that they forgot our savoury side dishes (though to e fair we did order a lot!) and the whipped cream and brie cheese didn't taste very fresh, as the brie cheese was crumbly as opposed to creamy and the whipped cream was on the verge of seperation.They supply you with napkins, butter and utensils, though the pancake flipping is a two man job! The batter comes in pipe bottles making it easier to make pictures - we checked out the photos near the counter and ended up making a cat, a snowman, hearts, swirls, butterflies, wrote our names and played noughts and crosses. There is a bit of an art too it, which makes it super fun!Whilst we were there a young boy badly burnt his hand on the hot plate, so dont go there with young children unless you keep close watch of them or order a la carte. For the rest of us though, its a fun experience! It was a out $50 for two people so be prepared to spend if you go all out
4
We took the kids here for dinner and they thought it was fantastic fun!! Got 4 bottles of pancake mixture between 7 of us but it really wasn't enough! After toppings and drinks the bill was over $100 which was expensive for a meal which didn't fill us up' but nevertheless it was fun and something different! Oh and try the lemon curd, it's delicious
3
It's a nice ambiance, friendly staff and quick service.I just really wished they had a wider variety of batter. They only have like 4 or 5 for you to choose from and we chose 3 but 2 were already out... and we were there during lunch. -_-Nonetheless, we enjoyed our lunch there... the service was simply friendly and efficient. =
4
Went to Slappy couple of times; apologies I only sent in my review now!I love the experience at Slappy. First off, you select the batter and ingredients that you would like to have and you'll be charged accordingly to the type of ingredients you've chosen. There are all-day breakfast and drinks like Lavender Lemonade which is excellent in my opinion.Typically I go in 2s or 3s and we usually get the following:- 2 type of batter (buttermilk & wholegrain is good but the others like Peanut Butter and Zucchini are good too)- 2 savory (cheese and mushroom usually)- 2 sweet toppings (blueberries and any nut)Maple syrup are given complementary unless you're opting for 100% maple syrup)Would not recommend getting white choc chip though. As they're technically choc butter and not very good for longer period on the stove.All in all, I really like slappy but it can get expensive especially if you're someone like me who loves to try around with the different ingredients
5
This is a place where you Chose your pancake batter flavour , filings, toppings etc. They bring it to you. and you get to make your own pancake On the stove that's right on your table. My daughter loved it.
3
Slappy Cakes is a restaurant for kids to play with their food. The kids are very entertained by it. This is all you should expect. There is no quality in terms of the food. Afterall, the kids make part of it.
4
The food was OK and the service was functional (albeit probably a bit below what we'd come to expect in Singapore) but the fun of making pancakes with the kids was great.
4
Set my mind on trying this but a little apprehensive about how the pancakes will turn out. In the end, the kids and I all had fun making our own pancakes. The buttermilk batter was good and maple syrup is free. Only added sides of mushroom and pork sausage for myself because the kids like theirs plain with maple syrup. Would like to try the other batters next time
4
If you're too lazy to cook your own meal after walking in Universal Studios for the whole day then skip this place. Otherwise, you can enjoy making your own pancake with different combinations - chocolate, peanut butter, the works. It makes for good conversation piece on who can make the perfect pancake.But fret not as there are other classic menus items including pasta and tortilla wraps and yes they have beer!!! so that even adults can have fun
4
After a day at universal studios on Sentosa we took the kids (teenagers) to Slappy Cakes as it's just opposite. They were keen to make their own pancakes.You order a bottle of flavored pancake mix comes in a squeeze sauce type bottle. 8oz Flavors include, peanut butter, chocolate, buttermilk. These are $8.50sdThen you pick toppings all between $1.50sd to $3.00. Such as choc chips, maple syrup, whipped cream, coconut.The table has a sunken hot plate built into the middle you switch it on they give you a couple of spatulas and away you go making your own pancakes.It was great fun and 2 bottles makes quite a few small pancakes.They also sell drinks like lavender lemonade which was interesting and thyme lemonade kids gave this ago. Also serve beer for the adults.Definitely worth a visit if you are going to Sentosa 
3
We wandered in here when another restaurant we wanted to eat at had a long line...this place was practically empty and we wondered if we were making a mistake. The dinner menu is extremely limited if you're interested in anything other than pancakes. We had pasta bolognese and spaghetti carbonara which was actually pretty good by Singapore standards. We chose chocolate pancakes for dessert. The sides ( extra charge for each )for the pancakes were extremely skimpy in my opinion. Definitely not enough for all the batter you get. Pretty pricey meal for pancakes and pasta.
3
Don't go expecting high end pancakes/crepes and a fine dining experience. Do go expecting the kids to have fun. The fun bit comes from cooking your own pancakes and adding whatever toppings you choose (to buy!) as you pay for everything. The kids can make pancakes in all shapes and sizes and are guaranteed to have fun. Will probably work for a party for children, but would start at age 10, if you want to be able to relax and not worry too much about the inevitable burns in younger kids.
2
A fun 'make it yourself' concept. However, I'm sure after a few visits this novelty would wear off. The food was unspectacular and, perplexingly, after a few hours of being open the restaurant ran out of one of it's main pancake batters. This shock was only surpassed by the poor quality waiting and rudeness of the staff. A thoroughly disappointing outing. Perhaps Slappy Cakea is worth a visit but I know I won't be returning soon
4
A fun concept that's terrific for the kids - just like you've heard, make your own pancakes. We had breakfast with our four-year-old who loved the concept, and it was easy cookin' when she chose chocolate as her badder - and with chocolate chips. I had the traditional pancake breakfast options with bacon and maple syrup - nothing special, taste wise, but still tasty nonetheless. Yup - the price is a bit high for what you get, but see it as both a meal and an activity. The drinks were mediocre, not sure why they didn't try harder with basic tea and coffee. I'm sure we'll return to this place, more for the experience than the food
