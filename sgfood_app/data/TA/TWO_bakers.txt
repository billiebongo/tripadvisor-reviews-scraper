The Food looks better than pictures on menu ..Bakers generous with cookies sampling. Brunch is tasty.
4
We ordered the lemon tart and matcha cake and they were absolutely worth it! However, their brunch was so so. The price is reasonable with no gst.
4
My favourite part of the cafe has to be the laid back vibes. Food was alright, not too bad. Had the truffle omelette, avocado toast, iced latte and the key lime pie. Good honest food but nothing to shout about!
5
This is one of the rare cafes that is a hit in food taste, food and cafe aesthetics, and prompt service which appears when you just need it. Very clean place too.
5
Went here with my Friends for lunch...I had the Beef Bowl and it was absolutely delicious....Cordial Staff .....definitely be back....
3
Staff were busy during lunch period. Was given a shared table despite making reservations in advance. Forget to include eggs in the big breakfast that was ordered.
5
Visited two baker's numerous times and the food never fails me. However the selection of cakes is very little.
5
Was there for coffee and ended up having lunch. I must say the food presentation is superb. The ambience is really good and the staff very patient with us. Recommends us food not just based on price which sadly many others does that to generate revenue. I ordered the Pandan Blueberry Hotcakes and it tasted excellent. Ordered Luncheon Fries too and nothing can go wrong with spam. Matcha Latte as usual is always good.My only regret was not able to order the Unicorn Stacked Hotcakes as it was only available on Sat and Sun only. Oh well, definitely will be heading there again to try it

Went to Two Bakers for lunch on a Saturday. The place was not too crowded and had a very pleasant ambience. The service staff were extremely attentive to our needs and even helped to prepare the cake for my friend's birthday celebration. We ordered the steak and beans as well as the yakiniku with angel hair pasta. Both were excellent. The matcha with red bean cake was also delicious. Highly recommended
4
what attracted me was the tarts variety they got so decided to check it out with a colleague. Bought chope vouchers thus decided to order mains too to try. I had the battered Fish & Chips with passion fruit sauce which I find quite interesting as it's not common. Am surprised to find the passion fruit sauce refreshing & light. Oh yes, the batter looks more like those chicken cutlet than the standard fish & chips batter but i must say, the fish is fresh.Bought 2 tarts (Key Lime & Magnum) home as it's too filling as I'm not super big eater. The Key Lime Tart is not overly sourish but yet you get to taste the sour with a bit of sweetness to it. As for the Magnum, well if you are a chocolate lover, you will love this as it's not too overly sweet.Great place for get-together as well as chill out
4
Loved loved loved the soursop cheesecake, it is something very unique and it was super good! Tried the watermelon cake and the side pastry was something really unique as well.
4
The detail to food wise is great, felt that it is cooked from the heart and reminds me if home. Very immaculate.
4
Came here for NYE lunch with friends and the food was great! A lovely place to hang out. We ordered pancakes with fried chicken, mushroom beef burger, kimchi fried chicken burger and cheese portobello. All were yummy!
5
Two baker's offers good food at reasonable pricing.
Average per pax spend is around 20 with a main course and drinks.
3
Love the decor of the cafe. Service staff were very friendly and helpful when asking for food recommendations.
3
Food looked good on the menu and the servings were quite adequate. However, the taste of the food was failing a little in terms of expectations.
3
Love the scramble egg crepe but the mango crepe cake was way too hard. Overall food was ok, cakes meh.
4
Homely ambience, warm service, good food (desserts!) and at excellent prices. only qualm was the inaccessibility. otherwise will definite come back again
4
Tried the unicorn pancakes, bacon mac and cheese and luncheon fries. Our favourite were the pancakes, especially the pandan flavored ones! Good coffee too!
4
Two Bakers is one of the many unfussy, industrial chic type cafes around - minimalist decor, metal-wood combination furniture, and a concise menu.The service is great - friendly and prompt. We were here for brunch, got the Scrambled Egg Croissant (subbed out salmon for avocado), Truffled Omelette, Iced Salted Caramel Latte, & the Orange-Mint Juice. The food was really good - the maple butter on brioche added a lovely touch to the Omelette plate. The juice could've done with mint in it rather than on top as an add-on, but considering how good everything else was, this was a minor hitch
5
Fantastic food and dessert. Food was served timely and fast. Atmosphere is homely. Surprisingly on Monday afternoon working day, place was fully packed
4
The coffee was fantastic, although quite expensive. A relaxing atmosphere with nice decor. Service was prompt.
3
It's my 2nd visit. The cappuccino and iced latte are decent. I wanted to try something different and had the sour sop cheesecake. It doesn't appeal to me but my hub liked it.
4
Cosy atmosph√®re, casual dining and friendly staff. Cashier was flexible enough to let me order lunch set at 10am.
5
Just a lovely way to spend a quiet morning. Perfect for breakfast with the family. The lemon and key lime tarts are wonderful.
4
It is a cosy place and not crowded at all during public holiday. This allowed me to enjoy brunch, tea and chit chatting with my girlfriends. It was an overall pleasant experience.
4
The coffee was delicious, and so was the breakfast and the cakes. The breakfast was of reasonable size, which left me and my sister still a little hungry after, but we are big eaters anyway. The good thing is that this left us some space for their beautiful desserts
4
went there for their key lime tart and mount fuji. really up to its name, will definitely head back for their tarts but I can't say so about their coffee. Had their Ice Salted Caramel Latte, but there wasn't much caramel or salt.. tasted just like ice latte with ice-cream
4
If you happen to be in town n looking for a nice quiet place to have a lovely brunch then two Bakers is the place. They serve up some really nice dishes n their desserts are a must to try. All like a piece of art to look at. Yummy
3
Made reservation but upon reaching, the place was full. Was advised by staff that waiting time for food is 40 mins and they asked if we are ok to wait. Signature dish/drinks were sold out by 2pm. Disappointing as didnt get to try what we cam from. Other mains were so so but the cakes were good.
3
The Baos were amazing and unique. However the salad was a little too salty for my liking. The service staff were friendly.
4
Both groups of friends I brought there love the truffle infused omelette. Looking at the pretty cakes brighten up my day!
5
I ordered a Mac & Cheese and 88 fries via Deliveroo (a delivery app).OMG!!!!I believe if the food still taste good when it is not hot (pardon me, the delivery was fast but it is nothing compared to food right from the kitchen isn't it) then the food must taste AMAZING if it is hot (if the food is supposed to be hot of course)The Mac & Cheese lifted up my spirit and soul! It is salty but it has five cheeses!!! If it is not salty I am concerned.The fries has this blended mushroom soup looking kind of dip. There is truffle and it is yummy. I am full but satisfied. Thank

I love cafe hopping and this cafe has much to offer. The Cafe has retained much of its character in the old shophouse and has a minimalist approach in its ID concept. The cafe opens daily from 9 a.m. and offers brunch till 5p.m. We had the signature carrot cake and Yuzu tart. The cake is moist and generously prepared with quality ingredients. The Yuzu tart offers an explosion of citrus flavours that is zesty and refreshing. we complete our indulgence with the double shots long black and we are ready to hit the road.I will certainly come back for more ... and very soon
4
Yes, after breakfast we came here for coffee, tarts and cakes. The place is a tad tiny, not a lot of seating. Like the ambience when i was here in the weekday morning 10am+. Had the Yuzu Tart and famous Carrot Cake. I was never a fan of Carrot Cake (except the Chinese version) but this was nicely moist, not too sweet and fresh. The ingredients are fine which makes the eating experience nice. The Yuzu tart a bit overly moist for my preference but still tasty. Coffee is hot which is important to me, and has the umpph when you take it in. Overall, a great first time experience. Will come again
1
Look and feel is nice. Staff is unfriendly in an almost comical manner. At payment I was yelled at i needed to pay at least 20 sgd to pay with my credit card. Sure, id be glad to be inconvienced to protect your margin, then after that you're supposed to pick up your food from a collection counter. With utter disgust one of the shopkeepers brought my food to the table, only to shout at me that this was a self service restaurant and i shouldnt expect my food to be brought to me. Hospitality certainly isnt a trait of two bakers. I wont be back
4
The overall food is nice and affordable..1. sambal prawn risotto is nice and the sambal cream is not too overwhelming for me. The prawn could be fresher.2. The corn fritter and crab cake is nice. There is some spices added in the corn fritter. The crab cake is full of crab meat which tastes really "crabbiful". Nice though..3. The chicken strip side dish consist of about 10 piece of chicken breast strip and deep fry. The flour is not thick and when dip in the Thai chilli sauce, it is delicious.4. The key lime tart is the best of all.. it's neither too sour or too sweet. It is fragrant and the after taste is great. The texture of the tart and the creme is really nice.5. The ondeh eclair is a creative dessert. Taste like ondeh ondeh.. however I feel that the filling it's a bit too hard for my liking and the gula melaka taste covers the whole dessert taste. It's not that it is not tasty, but if you want to taste individual pieces of the dessert, you have to leave the filling last. The pandan taste could be stronger.Overall, I will come back to try their other dishes, cafe ambience is conducive and quiet, price for the dishes is affordable (SGD 54 for 2 person for the above dishes, no GST and service charge
4
The place was great and service was good. The truffle omelette was nice but felt the portobello eggs could have been better seasoned and the sourdough improved. Only tried the dirty chai latte which was very good! Would not mind coming back here especially with a small group of friends as the prices are quite reasonable for well presented and good food in a comfy setting.
4
Redeemed my 1 for 1 mains promo with entertainer app. Ordered the truffle soba and chicken pesto pasta which was really good!! Serving was a little small though but quality is what matters most :) Also ordered the soursop cake which was refreshing and tangy, a perfect sweet ending to the meal!
4
Truffle omelette was decent, salad on the side was delicious, the dressing made it very appetizing. Avocado and ricotta on toast was scrumptious. We were happy with the pandan pancakes as well. The chicken tenders with pancakes was okay, pancakes for that turned out a little dry. Pear pie/tart was delicious. Very nice environment to hang out and catch up with friends.As for the coffee, I would suggest you go to CSHH around the corner on Tyrwhitt. This is after all a patisserie
4
Quaint, tucked away in Jalan Besar area. Lovely place with nice decor. Wide assortment of desserts - very pretty! The food's okay with a lot of brunch options. Would pop by again :)
4
Interesting and varied menu. Desserts were enticing from the display and well-executed but tended to be on the sweet side. Overall a nice vibe and relaxed environment. Staff was always pleasant and quick to respond. Will return!
4
The food ordered were all tasty and the cakes are pretty interesting
We enjoyed the place even though it was not a huge cafe.. suitable to chill..
4
Overall everything was decent. Except when we thought we could have chill the afternoon but large group came in and make the place abit noisier.
3
Visited on a Sunday afternoon for coffee with friends, felt that the drinks and the cakes were reasonably good but the airconditioning was not powerful enough for the whole area. We were seated at the bag and perspiring profusely despite there being a fan (can't be felt) and an aircon unit. Not too sure how the owners can improve this but just thought it would be good to have a cooler environment to chill (
4
We went there last weekend for brunch. I would say the three breakfast we ordered was average, nearby offers better ones, same rating gives to the coffee and hot chocolate.Well, I must give credit to their dessert/pastry from the display counter, we was attracted by its outlook, when we taste, it just melt in our mouth~~~ we ordered 3 and it all taste amazing!!
4
The deconstructed chicken pie was hearty and delicious and creamy! The big breakfast was not bad, but I didn't like the sausage, which tasted plain. Should have stuck to the more interesting fare. The restaurant was airconditioned but felt a little warm (for an airconditioned place). We changed our tables once, and it only got a little cooler. Maybe it is the weather. But my fellow diners didn't mind. Maybe it was just me
4
Visited the cafe on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. Was actually quite appreciative as crowds would mean noise and a less conducive environment to have a slow, extended and relaxed meal. This is probably one of the rare places which does not fall into the category of "the absence of spilling crowds equates to substandard food". I was surprised that Two Bakers excel in both mains and desserts. The Truffle Omelette I had was good and satisfied the egg-lover in me. The Purple Gold and Summer Yuzu both gave surprises and my friend and I were amazed by how well the different flavours which we have never thought of putting together can go well with each other. Will definitely be back to try other mains (e.g. Truffle Soba which we heard the next table exclaiming how good it was) and the rest of the desserts
3
Was not expecting to arrive and the table was not fully ready the table was prepared for four and not five. When we arrived for lunch there were already a few items that were sold out as well which was a bit of a disappointment. The food portions were also on the smaller side as well
2
Came here on a Saturday late morning for some brunch.Ordered the below items:1 x Carrot Cake ($8.50)1 x Mushroom Risotto ($13.80)1 x Long Black ($4.50)1 x Mocha ($6.00)The carrot cake was surprisingly dry and powdery - tasting like it had been left in the open overnight.The mushroom risotto was had an overpowering taste of black pepper which made the risotto overwhelmingly bad and spicy. The rice grains were mushy - probably a sign of being overcooked.The Mocha was still alright, and same as the coffee. Like the other reviewers, it was strong (high robusta?) and the only saving grace which kept me seated in the restaurant.The sugar at the table was presented in little jars - my advice to the owner is to replace this with sugar sachets instead. Come on, your coffee is THAT GOOD - don't disgrace it by having little sugar jars that clumps together under the humid Singapore weather! It is a big turn-off for the coffee enthusiasts who come to your restaurant seeking a good cup of Joe.Pros: This place does not charge GST nor Service tax.Cons: As above.Note:1. You have to spend > $20 before you can use a credit card for payment.2. Food collection is to be done by yourself - you are handed a buzzer upon payment, and then you collect your food from the kitchen counter at the back of the restaurant when the buzzer rings - this system probably makes it feel like you are eating at a food court
4
Nice place for coffee and cakes, though was a bit cramp between tables. Cosy place for small gatherings.
4
Cozy cafe with nice cakes and desserts. Mains offered are quite yummy too! Great ambience and really appreciate the friendly staff who always greet customers with a warm smile!
4
I went for lunch with colleagues. Our orders were placed around 1255pm.When I noticed the next table getting their food ordered after us, I alerted the staff.It turned out the kitchen printer was not working.The two affected tables were offered yummy profiteroles and coffee. That is a nice touch and good service recovery.They could do better with some disarming smiles and a simple apology
3
Staying in the area, we were looking for a place to have a nice breakfast and read about Two bakers, walking by on our way to the station at 11am, we stopped and noticed they weren't open (Who isn't open for breakfast until 11.30) We decided to stop by the next day when they opened at 10am. It was a nice breakfast, quite simple but tasty with fast service, mind you we were the only ones here. Perhaps some more consistent opening hours would serve them well, so if you are planing to go here, check the opening times before stopping by
4
Got to know this cafe on the way back to hotel. Managed to pop by just 30-minute before closing. Cosy small little cafe. Tried the "crispy duck" (if not mistaken), a mille feuille and it was nice. Prefer the cake here than the other cafe one just around the corner. But the hand brewed coffee was just too strong to my liking. Good visit overall
4
A very chilled vibe here, and had been told it was a top coffee spot. I was tempted by a rather yummy lemon tart, which was excellent(!) but sadly was disappointed by the coffee, it was luke warm. I probably should have said something, but I didn't. So I would suggest to ask for a 'hot' coffee, as I felt slightly let down. But good atmosphere, and beautifully laid out venue
5
The range of cakes and sundry desserts look great and taste to match.It is one of the better cafes in the Jalan Besar thriving cafe scene.However the opening hours online and on its doors are wrong. The staff told me they open 11am to 9pm daily except Tuesday. I have gone several times to find it closed until yesterday.Recommended for coffee and cakes
4
Came here for lunch today after exploring the vicinity. It's a popular place and there weren't too many spare tables. We had the truffle soba noodles and one of the bagels with a mix of egg, bacon, tomato etc. All very tasty. Prices seemed reasonable given the quality. Well worth a visit
4
Popped by TWO Bakers to try out this relatively new cafe after lunch. As we entered the cafe, we were greeted by tubs of pineapples tarts ready for sale. The pastry used for the pineapple tarts truly melt in your mouth. It's selling a small tub at $20 and seems like they have garnered quite a following for this popular CNY goodies. We shared a Yuzu Lemon Tart. The pastry was great but the Lemon tart could have been more tangy to be ideal. I had a piccolo latte and it's smooth and nice. I would probably come back for more but would like to visit the rest of the cafes in this laid back neighbourhood first!
5
My first time here, order breakfast menu and hot choco+espresso. The taste of meal is good, especially they brew the coffee, good enough.Using your e-voucher and get 1 extra menu as b1g1.Place is unique since they put all things as it is, feel like warehouse, happening concept for coffee shop recently.Just try..
