Had lunch twice here and the food was unpretentious, cheap and very good!
The lady that owns the place and manages it apparently all alone it extremely friendly and helpful.

The lady boss has decided to end her business for good. She needs to take a long break , I don't know when is the last day of doing business. It's probably end of this month. Please call in advance if you like to try your luck :

The laksa is, in my opinion, one that has: healthy combination, enticing outlook, fragrant and tasty, economic price tag. The only downside is the cafe's location, as it is not fully sheltered from the nearest public transport. One advice is to call or check on their Facebook page for updates before you make your trip there as I find that at times the boss may not operate the cafe out of the blue

This is a small and cosy restaurant located in the Little India vicinity in Singapore. The restaurant serves home cooked vegetarian food. The menu was rather limited but more than adequate and was reasonably priced. The menu offered mainly local food. The food was great and the ambience pleasant. I really had no complaints

Veggie cottage offers a limited black board menu of vegetarian dishes consisting of several mocks meats.I ordered the vegetarian chicken and rice at the suggestion of the owner. I sat down at a table and then was asked across the restaurant to come to the till and pay first. I always this is strange anywhere that claims to be a restaurant. So I returned to my table and from there I started to hear a series of microwave pings.... Sure enough, less than 5 minutes later my food appeared. I'm all for quick service but not if it means my food isn't actually cooked but simply reheated! It makes you think how fresh your food actually is.The food was ok, but sadly lacked any real flavour or wow factor. Overall a disappointment and I certainly wouldn't rush back. Prices are cheap, most meals between $5-$10. There is no wifi available.

Really nice home cook food using fresh ingredients. Prices are reasonable but need to wait as it's a small business run alone or with 1 helper?... not sure. Best is to call and make reservation in advance. tel 67856771, closed on Monday and Sunday only open till 4.30 p

This tiny place offers yummy original food. You might read "fish" and chips on the menu, but it is all veggie based. I loved the pasta and the people working there seem to be really kind, perhaps slow in service. I give an average rating because the place is nothing special, although characteristic. The food takes however 4 stars! Need to go back to try mor

Delightful vegan food for a price close to food court. Veggie Cottage is affordable, peaceful little cafe tucked away in a less than glamorous stretch of Little India. All foods are vegan and great esp. for kids meal as they have many vegan burgers, fries and desserts. Must try spaghetti bolognaise and stream fish rice.Service is a little on the slow side but the quality makes up for it. Great for a quiet lunch time and afternoon tea while once does not need to compete in a rush

This restaurant is situated at a corner of Little india. Was treated to a meal here on my birthday! Was looking forward to the chicken rice but only certain days got. Ate Chicken rice instead! the rice is very fragrant. Pumpkin soup is nice too! We ordered fried oyster mushroom as sides. There was curry powder provided to dip in and it was very nice too! My friend ordered fish and chip and it looked and tasted nice too!There were afew people when we came, but when we left at about 9,we were the only ones. Te elderly lady was very pleasant and took and served us personally, with recommendations and even warned us of the spice level of the green curry I was intending to order at first.Overall the atmosphere is nice and cosy! Will definitely come back again
