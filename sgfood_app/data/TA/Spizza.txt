The good news is they do deliveries (but that service is not as good as Domino’s) and prices are reasonable. The not-so-good news is the pizzas (we ordered 5 different kinds!) and salads are quite meh; certainly not top ten in Singapore.
4
The food we had here was really good, definitely satisfying. We had pizza, pasta and bruschetta and all were great. However, the service was pretty average.
4
We arrived early and the restaurant hadn't opened yet - the staff allowed us to order drinks which was great as we had to wait for some stragglers to turn up.
Good value for money - if you like truffle, try the Quinta pizza!
5
We tried 4 pizza, Quinta, Isabella, Tara and Pamela. All pizzas taste yummy. Waiting time was about 15min. The ingredients were fresh and toppings were generous too. Highly recommend for pizza lovers.
5
We visited on a Saturday morning and there was just one server there running the show... and he did an amazing job keeping us watered and fed, and also helped prep a surprise cake for my Niece! Thank you sir!

it is difficult to find a good pizza place in singapore, but Spizza is not too bad at the end. it is good value for money.. i don't mind go there for a quick dinner

Mea culpa.....I fell for a marketing trick. Having given up on ordering from Spizza ever again, I caved and gave them one last try when they sent me a 'birthday voucher'. Never again!I ordered online before they had even opened, so I knew that it would be a wait but hoped that given that I'd placed my order before the kitchen had even opened, at least there wouldn't be a backlog in the kitchen. Wrong! I received the 'usual phone call' at the scheduled delivery time to say that the 'rider' had just called to say that he was stuck in traffic and that the food would be a little late. I've become accustomed to this, so decided to heat up the oven to reheat the pizza as it always arrives cold. The man at the ned of the phone said that they he 'only works at the call centre' and knows nothing about their service or quality levels. Having lost patience with their incompetence, I called the restaurant to cancel the order. They told me that they knew nothing about the delay and that I should call their call centre. And so it goes....The food eventually arrived, to be fair, not as late or cold as usual. I was pleasantly surprised. The driver was incredibly polite and told me that he had come straight from the restaurant and hadn't encountered any traffic. Clearly, someone forgot to include him in the lie.The food was OK. Pizza was congealed, pasta was still warm, the drinks were nicely chilled. The bruschetta was particularly disappointing though; it should be described as a DIY dish (a plastic container with slices of yesterday's baguette, separate containers of tomato/garlic and a pot of olive oil).Once I'd cleared away the food, I called the call centre to understand why they can't just be honest if the food leaves the restaurant late? Why blame the delivery guy? After an initial dismissive excuse of it being a 'misunderstanding', the call centre blamed the restaurant. Seeing a theme here, I've given up on Spizza, with or without special offers

Pizzas are good! Unfortunately the pasta were dreadful, I throw away after my first bite. The taste stay in my mouth and make me feel like puking... I remembered I love their pasta when I visit the shop. However, it totally changed when I call for delivery. The pasta is so watery like am having soup.
5
Went out for a team lunch with my team and had my first meal at Spizza Club St branch.As we have Halal and Vegan folks in the team, choosing an ideal restaurant to fill our stomach has always been a challenge. Not anymore with Spizza as it takes care of all our different needs.Pizza:Elisa is nice and Quinta is just simply delicious.Pasta:Ravioli is really nice and Spaghetti Mixed Seafood in Tomato sauce is simply AWESOME.In short, was blown away by the food quality. I know many will debate that there're way better pasta or pizza elsewhere, but, this by far has been one of the best I've tasted for a while... Will return for sure
4
My cousin always says that it's the best pizza in Singapore. So when we visited, we tried it for lunch before our flight back home.Spizza definitely has great pizza to compete with other pizza joints in Singapore. I wasn't able to get the name of the pizza my aunt ordered. All I know is that it had prosciutto which is my favorite meat for pizzas.We also had gnocchi. It was ok for me. Nothing spectacular about it
3
This was my 2nd visit to this outlet, noted that the size of the pizza has strunk down significantly. Kind of disappointed. However the tiramisu was still very good.
5
Very good Food at a affordable price for Singapore. Both the pizza and the pasta are great choices here. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
4
Food is excellent. Waiting time for lunch can be improved. Arrived at 12noon. We waited for 30-40mins before our pasta are served.
4
A great place for a pizza, slightly away from the crowds of club street so less noisy, the pizza we were really impressed with , very tasty and great staff
4
Nice pizza, appetisers, pasta. Ambience is good for a friends' gathering to chat and mingle. Service could be improved further.
5
Ambience of the place was relaxing to cater for family. The food was good especially the pizzas. Must Try their Parma ham pizza and anchovies pizza. We ordered a lot for 4 pax and the price was at an affordable rate. Definitely to return again.
2
Drop by for lunch as two of my original picks were closed on Monday. Good menu selection but ultimately fail on delivery. Squid ink tagletini is over cooked,it's seafood sauce very average. Pizza with Parma ham and rucola:very sad looking rucola leaves on top of very large slices of ham. Would prefer some effort to cut the Parma ham into smaller strips. Service was more than acceptable thoug
4
Perfect place for quick lunch, we arrived at 12 noon sharp. The place was already occupied by few people. The pizza's are crisp and served hot. One medium size pizza with one drink is good enough for one person. We enjoyed the deal "$ 12 for one medium size pizza" and one plus one lemon ice tea for drinks, which made the lunch super affordable costing $17 per head. To avoid the waiting time, it is advisable to either pre-book your table or reach after 1.30 Pm types
5
We are relatively new to Singapore and have been searching for a great pizza and on the whole have be greatly disappointed. That was until a Friend recommended Spizza, it is definitely the best we have had.Fresh, tasty toppings, interesting combinations to try and a crispy base which is just delicious.Reasonably priced for Singapore, I have paid a lot more for smaller sizes and no where near as good.I have had the chicken pesto pizza twice and will definitely be going back to try others
3
I came back to the Club St outlet again recently for another lunchtime pizza. At $14 all in it's just a very good deal. This time around the place was a little busier and so it took a longer time to be served. The parma ham also didn't seem quite as fresh, but otherwise all was good. I'm sure I'll be back again
5
A good find. Food was delicious. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. They also do a lunch meue for 12 dollars and 2 for 1 on wine. Definitely recommend this place :)
5
The food is amazing and the staff are really friendly! Very satisfied with the experience! Definitely a go to place for awesome pizza!!
4
I was here for lunch with a friend. She got one of the vegetarian pizza's (which she enjoyed) and I got the Gnocchi. I definitely made the right decision - very nice.
4
Give colleague treat as farewell lunch. The waitress is very attentive and friendly. Pizza taste good using fresh ingredients.
4
Came here today for a pizza at lunchtime: only $12++ for a medium size pizza at lunch! Quality was quite good too and the service was efficient. Worth another visit.
5
Good Food. Nice Pizza. Will be back soon. Very nice service in the Club Street branch. The Philipino waiter is so nice and helpful.
5
One of my favourite pasta haunts. When I think pasta or pizza, Spizza is one of my personal favourites.
5
Great pizza and Italian menu tripped over the place by accident. Very good food and attentive staff. Large potions. Well served. Nice clean Recommended. As could find much open on a Sunday night in the area but this was really good. Nice wine.
4
Nice ambience and convenient location. Very near to telok Ayer MRT. Variety of pizzas are available but seems Base for all pizza are common. We ordered 3 types of pizza and they tasted good. My non vegetarian friends complained that meat is less on pizza. Do try tiramasu cake.
4
Made reservation online (chope.com.sg) for family at 7:30pm.Reached 10 minutes earlier and was urshered to our seat.Great place. Clean and brigjtly lited. No funky or massive cooking smell.Ordered half Rebecca and half Sofia large pizza, carbonara linguine, seafoof tomatoe linguine, ministrone soup, cheese balls and pennecote and tiramisuFamily enjoyed the hospitality, polite friendly waiter serving us.The food for its price is worth the value. Family.enjoyed the atmosphere and food and we did had a splendid time there
5
Been to spizza a few times. First went there on my first visit to Singapore a couple of ago. Visited again last week and again a week later. Food and service was consistent. Delicious pizza, great service.
4
Crispy thin crust pizza, not too big, with fast and friendly service. Napolitano is my favorite. It is a good place for a quick bite around lunch.
For dinner, Club street offers a very large selection of alternatives.
5
Excellent service, and a range of delicious Italian food. Large array of pizzas available, and can takeaway. Desserts include tira misu, panna cotta, and creme brulee. Salads are worth a look too.
5
We had a reservation for 20 people, and it was difficult to get everyone coordinated and head off to the restaurant together. Spizza was very accommodating and friendly with us. The food was also excellent; my friends enjoyed themselves greatly. Thank you Spizza!
5
Pastas, pizza, mushroom soup, burrata, calamari were all awesome. Staff were genuinely friendly. The place has been around for a long time and I forgot how good it is. Will definitely be back!
4
Great service, nice and cheery settings and value for money food. Saw a standee on the table saying $50 and above gets to have a chance to win a trip to Italy, only remember about that after we left, would be nice if the staff mention about it to us. 
5
Struggled to find somewhere open. A place down the road that was closing when it should have been open pointed us in its direction. Smiley speedy service, excellent choice of pizza and pasta. Beer on the expensive side. Busy with a mix of clientele. Open till 10.30 Sunda
5
Our family stopped here on our way to walk around Chinatown and were very happy that we did. We got 3 pizzas and a caesar salad. We loved each pizza that we got, and my husband liked the salad, but the rest of us didn't because we don't care for caesars with a heavy anchovy taste (which I realize is authentic). If you're looking for a good, hand-tossed, wood-fire cooked thin-crust pizza, come here
5
Was there with 3 other friends during lunchtime on a Thursday. Service was so good and we love the thin crust pizzas, specifically Isabella (Parma ham & rocket leave) and Qiunta (Egg & truffle paste) pizzas.Aglio Olio Pasta was also good and everybody enjoyed the food.Wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday, so we brought a cake along. They offered to change the plates and cutlery for us. Thumbs up for the service!
5
We went here on a Sunday night as most places in the area were closed. It wasn't cheap and we weren't sure what to expect. We decided on take away so ordered a pizza and s few sides. The food was actually excellent quality. The pizza was cooked in a traditional wood fired oven and was delicious. Sides also excellent. We were even given cutlery, chilli flakes and Parmesan!! The staff were also very friendly and even gave us seats and glasses of water when we waited!!
4
The pizza produced by Spizza are very tasty and must try drink is lychee juice. Spizza bakes their pizza in wood fired oven so its more delicious
3
An OK restaurant which we frequent purely because of its thin crust pizzas and location (Balmoral Plaza branch).
Minus points for the pool of oil always left on the plate.
3
Good selection of pizzas. Great place for a group catch-up without the fuss. Give the calzone a try!
1
Could be good but not. The food is fine but wine +++ is crazy expensive and the manager wants to sit, chat as if he's a long lost friend...
VERY unlikely to return...
4
A place that serves vegetarian pratha, rice, noodles upto 3am in the morning. As the name suggests it is spicy, rightly to suit Indian taste. Cheese Pratha, maggi goreng, rveg rice, milo dinosaur a must try.
1
I eat here every other month for their fresh tasting food. My favorite is the Margharita pizza with a generous topping of herbs and extra topping if Rucola leaves. Late last night I saw a waiter using his bare hands (no gloves, no things) to handle the raw herbs that was to be placed on the pizza I had ordered. Apparently he was going to do likewise for the Rucola. I think that this is very disgusting habit, and a disrespect to the diners. It is obvious that this restaurant has no ethics on proper preparation of food, or that the waiting staff was angry that I came to order food at 1030pm. They could have just turned me away, not do something disgusting. Is the wait staff trained about food handling and food safety? Why is the wait staff preparing food, instead of the cook? Not eating here again
1
After waiting for one and a half hours (though the nearest Spizza is 10 mins away), I was left waiting for food that was 'never ordered'. I wanted to try an healthy option... unfortunately, I guess it's back to Pizza Hut. Bottom line: Pizza Hut is way better
5
Best wood-fired pizzas in town! I tried a “Katerina” pizza with beef carpaccio, rocket and mozzarella while my partner had the “Elisa” with pesto and olives. Both were delicious and we would definitely return! Generous sizes as well, and fun to wash down with a bottle of reasonably-priced prosecco
1
Had home delivery last night - Bukit Timah area. First time we have tried Spizza. Our usual home delivery (Peperoni) was not taking any more orders....so we branched out to see what other pizza Singapore had to offer. We ordered 2 pizzas.....delivered in 2 hours cold with a soft flacid crust...no joy in that! Ravioli - cold, stuck together and not tasty at all. Waste of $60+. So SPIZZA....you don't get our vote or any future orders
2
Ordered delivery a few times and was shocked at their service. Missing items here and there. This one time they even gave us a salad without the dressing and still had the guts to ask us to drive back down again to pick that up. Never order from them again!!
3
And pizza we got! "Rebecca" pizza was ok, and we got our bellys full. Nothing worth telling home though, as most of the pizza was dough (the fillings filled about a 7 inch radius of a 12 inch pizza). Service was friendly!
3
We went there for diner, the pasta and the pizza was good. But the air con is too cold. It looks like you're eating in a freezer... Next we'll bring a coat !! Food is good that's matter.
4
They do pizzas and pasta... all varieties..all flavours ...all day. Reasonably priced. If you want a pizza whilst in Singapore...then go in. They deliver at home too FYG . Not more to add really
1
Ordered a pizza and lasagne at 9pm last night. At 10:15 phoned to ask how much longer - apparently driver had left.At 10:30 phoned - apparently stuck at previous delivery and with us very soon.At 11:00 phoned again (after trying 4 different numbers (most don't pick up, or take 5 times to answer and then don't phone back)). Said would phone back - didn't so kept trying to phone again.Eventually got through - apparently driver had now dropped food and chef had gone home.They said they would do 2 lasanges. At 11:30 these arrive (via a very apologetic man in taxi and offered for free).Unfortunately the food was inedible. Not sure how they made the lasagne but there was NO pasta in them! and the meat tasted burnt.So overall, waited 2.5hrs for food. What did arrive was inedible, and whole process was a complete shambles
5
We ordered the 20" pizza for $48. The menu says it comes with four toppings, but by toppings they actually mean four different specialty pizza toppings. So one of our toppings was the "Barbara" - Italian minced pork, red onions, olives and mozzarella - then we picked three other choices. Needless to say we were impressed. We were even more impressed when the pizza came and it was delicious. The service was excellent and the tiramisu for dessert was fantastic.We'll definitely be back
1
Takes forever for a pizza if u r requesting for delivery despite promising 60 to 90 min arrival time. From time of dispatch to time at your door was more than 45 min. I can see from the other reviews that I wasn't the first to experience this. If Spizza wants to offer delivery service this issue has to be seriously looked into
1
Service was slow. The manager and pizza chef were grumpy. I can't fault the chef though because he was the only one making ALL the pizzas for ALL the customers. They're short of staff and the grumpy manager is of no help. We asked for some water to balance off the sweet birthday cake. Instead of serving us water with new glasses, their staff just poured into our barely empty iced teas. Too busy or just downright lazy? When I got the bill, I noticed the bill came with a flyer promoting that Standard Chartered Preferred World Mastercard customers are entitled to a discount. Upon seeing my card, the manager felt it was her divine obligation to educate me that my card should have the word "Preferred" on my card to be eligible for a discount. I know my status well and I know I was eligible but insisting on the petty issue of yjr card'd design would just be feeding the troll. We were 12 and obviously she wasn't happy with the business we just gave her company. Love the pizzas but seriously Spizza in Club Street is in need of talent with good customer service
4
I've always considered Spizza as an "in-between" - in between a higer-end fast food joint and a authentic Italian pizza restaurant like Etna or Riccioti. But that is a compliment! Because their service is quick and not-much frills, and their prices are very reasonable, and their pizzas are not bad at all. At Spizza, they name their pizza with Italian female names! I like Sofia (seafood pizza), Isabella (Parma ham, rockets), Pamela (mushroom and cooked ham) and the Olivia (salami, fresh chilli). And the good thing about this place is that they are generous with the condiments (olive oil, chili oil, grated parmesan and chili flakes) as I love to slather my pizza with a copious amount of olive oil and chili flakes!A very Italian way is to have a pizza with a beer or a coke! And that's what I like to do at Spizza
5
And we were here on a quiet Sunday evening. We went to the outlet on East Coast Road, Katong. Ordered Pizza and wine followed by Pannacotta. Had heard about the food here from friends and were not disappointed. We got what we asked for. The service was good as well. The menu is extensive with a choice of pastas and pizzas with a local twist as well. I prefer pizzas with thin crust and thats what they offer. So it went down well with me. The Pannacoat was good but I have had better. All in all, a place I would visit again for my pizza fi
3
I went to Spizza a week ago and order soup, salad and Juliana Pizza. I'm expecting something extra ordinary but it taste just the usual pizza with thin crust. The service is very good though and Pizzaiolo is friendly and greeting every guest that comes in
2
I know how to make my pizza dough, so I have a hard time eating pizza out. To me this is one more fast-food kind of pizza. Nothing special about it.
4
You can find practically any combination you like from the usual hawaiian to the exciting indian insipired pizzas.
5
One of the best Indian food place which you could find. Taste is awesome, and so is the atmosphere. Fine dinning concept. If you are not really an Indian food lover, Spizza got Western, Local, Malay food as well. And the it comes with guaranteed awesome tast
4
The best pizza we have had in Singapore,maybe we need to get out more!. We had a spontanous visit to Spizza in Balmoral Rd. A newish outlet so the decor was clean and fresh, with simple furnishings. Service was prompt, staff were pleasant. We had a wood fired pizza, which had a nice crunchy thin crust, with just enough tasty toppings, asked for extra garlic which we received. Prices were average for Singapore and we would definately return
3
If you like thin pizzas this is your place, the have good taste but still not enough good for my palate. but the way if you are hungry and want a nice pizza go for it, the rest is normal, not much to say about it
5
I have been a customer to this Spizza for a long time and i still dine there often.The pizzass are very nice,thin and crunchy...freshly made and the ingredient also very fresh.They even have a delivery service now which i used it for couple of times...fast delivery,food came still hot and fresh!
1
I dont like to write bad review especially when the core of the business is rather good (pizza here are quite good to me).But the service is becoming non-sense here. I used to order for delivery. Now and for the past 3 times, 3 different things happened that made me cancel the order. First time you have to wait 1 hour and a halfThen you have to wait 2 hour and a half (who order a pizza like buying a flight ticket)Last but not least, now combo (you can see on the flyer) is not for delivery anymore (sorry guys but this is called fake advertising).I am done with you guys - plenty of competitors are doing good pizza too.....Tonight was my last try, you lost one custome
3
We went to spizza in a big group of 10 people. We ordered a variety of pizzas and pastas. While the thin crusted pizza were good, the ravioli and gnochhi were below average. Its a lot more pricier than wine connection in terms of wines and food and wine connection had better food.
4
I go to Spizza, when I want a classical Pizza with thin bread. I usually go to Club Street. The atmosphere is cozy, but the main reason why I go there is the quality and the speed of the Pizza. Sometimes I order online, when I want to watch a movie and have Pizza on Saturday evening.
4
After a long day of travel, sight-seeing, and happy hour, we stopped into Spizza for two of our Italian favorites--ricotta cheese ravioli and caprese salad. The portions were plenty for two people. The salad was fresh, and the ravioli were piping hot with a hearty tomato sauce. Just what we needed! The atmosphere isn't much and the service isn't memorable at all, but for an affordable, cheap meal, look no further than Spizza
3
the pizza is excellent, tasty and at reasonable prices.
desserts are great,too
2
Pizzas were good when it first opened. However, quality has dropped a lot in recent years.
4
Cool concept. Good Pizzas. Spizza and Skinny Pizza is a good choice for thin crust pizzas.
5
The Lasagne is piping hot and terrific, i couldnt help it.. Then I polished off a pizza for good measure.
4
Spizza has an outlet just down the road where we live and therefore has become the default place to grab a bite when we come home late from work. Their pizzas are very good - thin crust and good amount of toppings.
5
This is our fav place for pizza. Try Quinta, pizza with truffles and egg! Very fragrant and tasty. I loved the one with parma ham and vegetables on top too.
2
Just wanted to order a pizza, which are usually quite good. But this time they simply answered delivery time will be between 2 to 3 hours, without feeling ashame...Next time I will order a week in advance.
I did not order.
4
I live near the Club Street restaurant and so far only taken the take-away pizza's. Great value, $21 (1-for-1) for two large pizza's while the renovations are ongoing. So far we've taken the pesto chicken, pepperoni and the parma ham/rocket pizza...very tasty, thin-crust from their "torch" fired oven. (don't know why they keep calling it wood-fired..)Will keep coming back
4
The first thing that struck me as I walked into Spizza was the scent of detergent, but I've never been one to be put off a restaurant because they've cleaned it recently. We had two great pizzas (an Eliza - pesto, pinenuts and cheese, and a Xandra - pineapple, parma ham and onion) that were certainly big enough for us (don't order a large unless you're an enormous gourmand) but unwisely we had starters as well - the pizza plus soup was just a bit too much.Service was prompt, although at six when we arrived they were in the throes of dealing with a massive take-out order - something like eight or ten pizzas to box up - so at busy times you might find your pizza slightly delayed. Late afternoon on a Sunday presented no problems at all, and the staff were attentive and friendly throughout. Will definitely return
1
A bunch of around 10 of us went inside hoping for a fun Saturday evening... we were greeted by a staff who was visibly displeased to see a large crowd... we ignored that and told him we would check with the rest in 2 mins and get back to him... he smirked and tapped hos watch saying your time starts now... I am all for fun people at restaurants... they always enhance the dining experience... but I was stunned at the racial slur... his smirk and indignation was unmistakable... One thing is for sure: None of us is ever entering this place agai
4
highly recommend the seafood pizza- Sofia. generous yummy toppings. nice thin crust
4
Very nice food and good service, families are more then welcome.
best pizza so far in Singapore, nice selection of Italian beers!
4
Neat and Clean! You'll love this restaurant also for sure.
4
If you are looking for a quick but great pizza fix, go down to Spizza at Club street (they have a few outlets in town and also a delivery service),
the pizzas are thin crust and baked in wood-fired oven!
4
My all time fave!
2
innovative names for pizzas. nice flavours but thin crust. not good when you're v hungry
3
Crispy thin crust!
3
Nice space with decent pizzas. The margarita and olive & pesto pizza were good. The Helena (chicken pesto) was poor. Good kids menu. We also tri the Zara (dessert pizza with chocolate, bananas and almond flakes) which was interesting but didn't work as well as I thought it would based on an amazing nutella pizza I have in the south of France
2
pizzas are thin, small and not great at all. we are Italian and we know how pizza should be. Anyway Singapore is a place with great food and you do not need to eat pizza (we went there only because kids wanted a change from Asian food
5
A terrific, family friendly place! I cannot speak of the other locations in Singapore but the Balmoral Plaza location is wonderful. After living for two years in Singapore; we returned to Europe and had not visited the location for more than one year. On a recent trip with family, the staff greeted us with huge smiles and hugs, remembered our usual orders and treated us like returning royalty. The food is solid overall (pizzas are great in my opinion) and inexpensive and itâ€™s the terrific staff that really makes the place stand out.Do yourself a favor and visit Spizza Balmoral Plaza
3
One of the best Italian pizzas. I love the thin & crispy crust and the lasagna. But the last delivery, the service was horrid, came 2 hours late and food was cold.
4
Nice woodfired pizzas. I pronounce it "Spee-Zah". It definitely sounds unappetising when some of my friends call it "A*s Pizza"...
2
Pizzas are too thin for my liking, not v filling
3
I like its thin and crispy crust, ingredient quality better than many youngster new cafe.
1
poor service,poor pizza variety and quality
5
actually there is spizza at kemang, but why can't i find it here..hiks..its an amzing thin pizza, an lots of variation
3
Good value for money. Nice crispy texture and quality ingredients.
5
The pizza names are so confusing
4
Nice crispy base but a bit pricey and delivery service is slow.
4
excellent pizzas !
4
Nice! This will be our new pizza joint! Brick oven pizza with a thin, crispy crust.
4
Love the tomato soup that's perfectly balanced in taste, and margherita pizza...sometimes the most simple things are the ones that come out worong...not here though :)
3
Decent pizzas
5
lurve the pizzas at Balmoral branch
4
One of the better Italian style pizzas.

Great Pizza - all Pizza named after ladies.... hee...

of course the best is still Napoleon Pizza.. "sisters" to senso & la nona outlets. good price for a good pizza !!!
3
Went there for lunch on Saturday and the place looks dead. Pizza is decent though
5
We looove Ursula (pizza generously topped with smoked salmon, spinach, cream cheese, and capers)!!! Yum! :)
5
love the thim crust and the pizza's names.
3
If you're looking for an easy pizza place to go to in Singapore (that's not quite fast food), Spizza is it. The variety is good - we had the Elisa (basil pesto, mozzarella, tomato, black olives, pine kernel, parmesan) and a Laura (4 cheese). The ravioli with ricotta and spinach in tomato sauce is tasty but could have been served much warmer. I just wish the service was as good as the food
5
very hard for us to find nice italian restaurant in singapore but this is the one i recommend.
3
Has my favourite thin crust with anchovies, mushrooms and fresh chili.
3
Light & crispy pizzas...n whole range of fresh greens.
3
One choice: The smoked salmon with spinach. My favourite pizza there! My only complaint is that generally the dough is too soft and flimsy.
4
I love their thin crusted pizza with generous amount of toppings..uhh lala
5
Loved the beef carpaccio pizza!
3
Quality inconsistent
5
best pizza in singapore
3
crispy thin pizza, best in town! love the salami pizza, can't go wrong! for less sinful choice, try the ones that come served with salad ON TOP. unique pizza, avail at spizza only. oh ya, note how they named their pizza - all in female names
5
If I am craving for pizza, this is the place I would go.. not every branch has the same quality. The club street and habour front is better.. the thin crust and the cheese.. yum yum.. n all the dishes on the menu are ladies' name, too bad is not ladies' photo.. hahahaDont miss the bruchetta too if you r a bread person, the garlic n olive oil n tomato.. I am drooling alread
