We ordered set menu. Quantity was good enough for four pax. Black pepper crab was very nice. and bamboo clam is also delicious.
My family enjoyed good food.
5
Great food, especially the chilli crab with mantou. We ordered another serving! Also the fresh baby sotong with chilli and lime, and the signature prawn dish. All in all, a satisfying meal and friendly service too!

Long Beach Dempsey is a wonderful restaurant, and it’s very accessible. The food is fantastic, and given that some Singapore restaurants can be expensive, I think this is moderately priced relative to the quality and service they deliver. I’ll be going back on my next visit to Singapore.

I can't say we are easily impressed with food, but today the food was wonderful, different flavors, spicy, but not too spicy, and very well seasoned. The Black Pepper Crab (S$ 71) is what they are known for and for a good reason, but the razor clams (S$ 16/each) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass Penang style (S$ 41)! Also the fried rice with dried scollops (S$ 18) was light and very good texture. Even the Spinach with Oyster Sauce (S$ 18) was very tasty. Of course a glass of Tiger draft (S$ 6.90) helped to cool the spice :).When eating the Black Pepper Crab, ask for gloves and a pick, as well as a bib to keep from splattering on your clothes! It comes out piping hot.Service was very good, and afterward we asked for a cab, which they called for, and it was here in less than 5 minutes.Definitely, for first timers to Singapore, and most experience dinner

I normally am not a fan of set menu as I like to mix and match my own. I can’t tonight because it is their busiest time of the year hence everyone has to choose a set of dinner from their menu. We chose the SGD348+++ menu and I must say surprisingly we all enjoy our meal very much!!! The food is fresh, well cooked and simply delicious. The dessert is fantastic, grapefruit coconut pudding with fresh mango. Their service despite a full house is impeccable. They change our plate after serving one dish and keep checking on us if we need anything. We will definitely go back again.

The restaurant is not fancy in terms of look, as it is quite simple and not super cosy.Nevertheless the welcome and service is really nice, waiters and waitress are taking care of their customers with attention.The food was delicious, we had sevr’earl plates to share and all of them were tasty. Super fresh seafood, you can trust the place!

Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private rooms and plenty of seats for outside dining . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service !

It was the second time in a week we decided to go for chilli and pepper crab. We went to Holy Crab in Bugis area and was disappointed. Maybe it’s because we always wanted the original taste. So this time, we decided Long Beach since it’s always good. We ordered both pepper and chilli crab and thought they had changed the recipe for the chilli crab as it tasted different. In the end we realized that we were served Thai style chilli crab. For those who are craving for the original chilli crab, please make sure you order the right thing bec they assume you want their most popular Thai style chilli crab. I guess we will have to go back another time to have the original one we have been craving for

To be honest this is our go to destination in Singapore for black pepper crab...it is truly delicious and in fact that’s all we have except for Tiger Beer on tap! Park right out the front and Ideally go next door to Red Dot (see photo) to have a brew or a cocktail first. Sit at a table the garden and listen to the birds - it’s rustic and we love it and we were treated to an approaching thunderstorm yesterday without the rain...bliss

We were told by locals to go and try black pepper crab at this restaurant. We did. The service was good. They even took out the meat from the crab for you. However the most important thing about food is the ingredients. The crab is not great at all. They give you mud crabs which are tasteless. Therefore black pepper, which you can order for hotter or less hot, is the only taste you get from this dish. And the razor cram was overcooked. So all in all the lunch was not so good as expected and it was expensive too.
4
Service was really good! The food was good as well, but quite overpriced in my opinion. Worth a visit when you’re in Singapore.
5
The best pepper crabs in Singapore. We also had the wasabi prawns and Kayla which were superb. A must visit in Singapore
4
Iconic and classic seafood place in Singapore. Claims to be there creator of the black pepper chili crab. Thing is I don't eat sea food but judging by my colleagues, they loved it. Quick service.
4
We were brought here by a local contact & I will make sure I plan a night in this area next time I come back to Singapore. I love how they’ve reused the old British Army Barracks for restaurants & bars. The food here was good & service was excellent. The chilli crab tasted great although you’ve got to enjoy spicy food to manage i
4
We went for the pepper crabs and your can bring your own wine there for a small corkage charge. We had steamed prawns along with a fresh fried fish. Service is friendly and very good. One of our favorite seafood restaurants that has lasted through time.
4
Iconic food does not come cheap in Singapore. At least not crab and seafood.But if you must try crab done Sg style, then there's only Long Beach and Jumbo, cos these are the two popular places to try crab. Some may also include No Signboard and Eng Seng, or some zichar palace at your HDB void deck. But really, when it comes to iconic and signature, only Long Beach and Jumbo should be considered, for tourists and guests from overseas. (cos if you're trublu local, you will either diy at home, which is not difficult; or you will know of some joint somewhere offering cheaper, and perhaps better alternatives)
3
Came here on our last night in Singapore. We wanted to try their black pepper crab. They have a few set banquet which of course all feature either black pepper or chili crab. We've picked one with razor clams (was excellent) and lala rice noodle (I've read that's good). There were quite a few tables around us but somehow everyone's food came before we did.The waitress did warn us that the normal crabs they had at the time were a bit small so was expected that. However, we were a bit disappointed with the black pepper crab. Didn't find the taste that great.We then ordered another type of crab (Scottish wild crab) and cooked it with chili, this dish was excellent. The crab was sweet and the chili sauce was very fragrant. Perfect to dish the fried buns in.The meal was not cheap but at least we had a few good dishes

Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is now having their Alaska Crab yearly promotion in Oct 2017. I had two times already and going to have another 2 rounds next week. This round the promotion has to order a set course for min 4 people. It is good though because we can also enjoy other seafood such as prawn, fish and bamboo clams etc. Why so many times in a month? simply because they have the best Alaska crab in town esp. price is reasonable at SGD88 per kg - 50% compared normal price. You can choose to have white pepper or chilly or 2 flavors separately. My favorite is white pepper flavor. Lastly, Long Beach has the best Restaurant manager called Priscilla. She provides excellent service to me and my guests. We feel like eating at home. Well done Priscilla. Tip: you can upsize with additional cost and it is worth to do that because the bigger the size the better the crab meat.
4
Arranged by our hotel,very busy Saturday night,We sat outside and enjoyed the cooler weather.Due to the very busy night service was a bit slow but understandable . We sat on a couple of beers and watched the action.We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and side dishes and were not disappointed when they arrived. A Large crab with the most magnificent pepper flavour I have tasted plenty of meat and rice
3
Food was fine in my opinion standard fare for Singapore and 8 of us eating but still hurt a bit when I picked up the bill. Charging for the wet towels was cheeky considering gwe ordered and paid for prawns and two crab. Tried to order the crispy duck but a CA's eof sorry sold out which is also a fail in my book. If passing would probably go back but wouldn't bother to make the trip from downtown again, food from a hawker centre as good or better.
4
The food is OK. Average seafood. No choice for vegetarians. The staffs are nice and the service is good. A bit pricey. Went for CNY celebration lunch
1
lol what a joke. You have to pay for the wet napkins that they give you. Crab is messy what do they expect you to do? Use the table cloths?? My boyfriend and I got a bad first impression since they were pushing the most expensive items on us and rushing us to order we should have known better.
4
This place is really casual outdoors (plastic tables on the veranda) but it's a nice spot and very green. There are also indoor tables and private dining rooms that are slightly less casual. The food is standard Singaporean seafood fare, but well done. Quality is excellent. My pet peeve is they can never bring all the food at once even when I ask, they instead bring it when it's ready. The service is average as expected in Singapore. As previous reviewers mention, you'll be charged for everything you touch so if you don't want to pay for the peanuts, don't eat them.
3
Not a bad place if you want to enjoy Chinese seafood in Singapore . This place is very popular with tourists, locals and a favorite place to entertain business visitors to Singapore. Overrated.Pricey, but so is everything else in Singapore. There are many other places equally good if not better and cheaper
5
Have not been here for many years. Husband reminded me of it so I booked a table for a Saturday dinner.We were promptly greeted at the entrance. As we booked for an early time slot, restaurant was quite empty at that time.The staff took our orders very quickly and made good suggestions on what we could order. My son was eager to eat the famous Singapore chili crab with mantou, a kind of fried bun. Supposed to dip buns in the crab gravy, really yummy stuff!We also ordered fried baby squid, prawn fritters, beef rice noodles, fried rice, venison, etc. Food standard is still high compared to last time. The only downside of the restaurant is no sheltered car park. It was drizzling when we reached there so had to look for brollies in the car. Overall it was an enjoyable experience dining at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant as staff were attentive and food was good
4
I can't complain about food quality. One of the best tasting Chinese seafood restaurants out there. No wonder it is always included in the search results of top 10 chili crab in Singapore.I recommend the following dishes: black pepper crab, crispy baby squid, steam grouper in Hong Kong style soy sauce, roast chicken and baby kailan. These were paired with fried rice with tiny fried silver fish. Really nice fresh taste of the steamed fish and nice juicy tender roast chicken.I also can't complain about the individual service of the waiters. Courteous, and attentive. They knew what to do and they were a pleasure to talk to and ask recommendations about the food.However, the kitchen just couldn't cope with the full house of diners. Our food was served one dish at a time. Delivery was much too delayed. Lastly, the steamed grouper came 20 mins after the first item was placed on the table. Diners cannot enjoy their meal if the dishes are served piecemeal.Would have rated this resto 5 stars
4
I have eaten at Long Beach before and wanted to have the crabs on this trip too. I ordered a pepper and a chili crab, and some baby kailin. I was charged S$2.00 for the peanuts that they brought to the table, S$1.80 for the rolls and S$0.60 for the towelettes. In the grand scheme of things not a big deal from a monetary perspective, but on a S$200 tab, give me a break. I guess that's how they stay in business and maintain margins, but it is irksome to see on the bill

Long Beach @ DEMPSEY Located at 25 Dempsey Road. There are many famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore, but Long Beach has to be the top ONE. I make it a point when I have visitors or friends visiting Singapore to take them to Long Beach for there more famous Singapore Chili Crab and black pepper crab and off course for the other scrumptious seafood on offer. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend

Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private room and plenty of seats outside . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service !

Our friends had gone here and recommended it and so we booked through the concierge at our hotel who told us it was upscale casual. It's casual casual with slippers and t-shirts. It's the kind of restaurant that they place food on your table that you haven't ordered and will charge you for it unless you say something. We ordered the chilli crab, med order of prawns, med order of noodles, vegetables and 4 beers and it came to $240 singapore dollars. There is however a restaurant 5 minutes walk away called the Red Dot that has great live music and a good vibe!
5
The meal is bound to be expensive so it's not for those trying to preserve their wallets. However, the food here is really pretty good, especially their seafood choices. Recommended is the chili sauce lala and black pepper crab. Enjoy!
3
Extremely expensive meal. They were full indoors so we had to seat outdoors, but it was extremely hot and stuffy. We did not enjoy the dining experience.
4
The pork ribs are phenomenal! The food is generally nice but a bit on the pricey side. Try to get seating indoors as it can get rather hot and humid outside
4
Had an excellent dinner with four outside and of course enjoyed the pepper/chili crab as main dishes! Also ordered the bamboo scallops which also tasted excellent. And all with great Erdinger hefe weizen. A recommender!
5
We just finished a family dinner here in one of their private rooms, served by a very attentive captain who even took our pepper crab claws away to de-shell for us. For big parties (9 of us), their set menus offer good value, as their a la carte prices are on the high side. The price worked out to about $100/head (including drinks of beer and juice), which by Singapore standards is pretty acceptable for a meal in a good setting of quality dishes comprising the freshest of seafood. The menu comprised lobster, crab, steamed fish, duck, scallops with asparagus, noodles and a dessert. Their seafood dishes were indisputably excellent, to be expected of a restaurant that has built its reputation on seafood. The surprise item that we all wow-ed over were the noodles, cooked in an exquisite duck broth flavoured with cabbage leaves and pumpkin. You leave the restaurant feeling good not just with the food but at the way the restaurant staff have all been trained to thank departing guests as they make their way out, making you feel that you have been a most welcome guest
5
I probably went more to East Coast for seafood but never try it in Dempsey Hill before. The whole place is different from the city centre but full of reminiscences of the colonial times. The first dish of deep fried lobster is so fresh that surprised all of us. Unlike the traditional Cantonese way of preparing seafood, there is always a different spice of south east origin in every dish. Same goes to the pepper crab, fish and others. At the end, there is the noodle with blue swimmer crab. It is so delicious to end of the dinner
5
If you like seafood, this is the place to go to, but make sure to wear a colourful shirt, because it is all about eating with hands... Aprons are available for those who want one. The Pepper Crab and Child Crab are truly excellent dishes, when ordering ask the staff to crack the shells for you if you want to avoid doing this yourself... The crabs are massive, but If you want the really big crabs, order them in advance to avoid disappointment as they sell VERY quickly. The Razor Clams are also excellent as are the prawns and generally other seafood dishes. Great to go in a group and order plenty of beer by the pitcher. The staff are great, friendly and happy to provide fast, efficient service. What a great time we had... One small negative point, catching taxi's from the restaurant is not as easy as you would expect... but gives you a chance to walk off the excellent food you have indulged in!!
4
I usually go to the Long Beach UDMC restaurant so my expectations were high. The food didn't disappoint me, the black pepper crabs were amazing. Whilst waiting for friends to arrive, we had the white bait coated in 7 spices with our beer which was also excellent. Dinner was quite expensive though, S$115 per person.Restaurant is in an old military colonial building and we sat outside on the veranda under a ceiling fan. It was nice but given the choice, I would prefer to be eating by the sea in the East Coast Park.However after dinner, it is possible to visit the Red Dot microbrewery, which is next door
4
Our family's favourite haunt for good seafood. We like most of the dishes especially the black pepper crab and Lala Horfun. It has free parking but remember to make reservations because it is always fully booked. Private rooms are available if you spend above a certain amount.
4
It is a must go for the pepper and chili crab! Razor clams with garlic sauce very good. The drunken are also perfectVery casual atmosphere. Do not go with white clothes as it is not compatible with the crab sauces! Only down side no wine selection. Only cocktail beer or sake Reasonable prices. Cheaper than Newton Circle paid 160$S for one pepper crab, one chili crab, 4 razor clams, some vegetable , two bols of rice , one coconut and one bee
5
Spendy - 258 SGD for a family of 4 - but a classic place for pepper crab and chili crab. A great atmosphere. You can sit inside or out. In a rustic setting. Highly recommended.
5
Have been there several times but the chilli crab always have been the tastiest and never disappointed us. Portion can be big but the friendly waiter always advises you what is best.
5
This very busy seafood restaurant in Dempsey Singapore does the best black pepper crab as well as the better known Chilli crab. Also try to the razor clams in garlic. Best to book as this is really popular. Stays open past midnight.
4
enjoyed the pepper crab, spicy crab, lobster and a plethora of other dishes. Atmosphere was festive, with Chinese-style private dining rooms. More a casual, big group place for celebrations than a place to take your sweetheart for a romantic dinner. If she wants a beer, a bib, and a big crab... then take her :
5
If seafood is your delight you will be well pleased with the Chilli Crab served at this Resteraunt because they are amazing and served by a very friendly staff The place is ideally located on the coast which at night is particularly spectacular by the ships waiting to dock in the background We had been there in 2009 and it was every bit as good in 2017
4
this was one of the best crab place in Singapore.we visited the place for dinner at 8:30pm, but was told big size crabs were all gone. I strongly suggested those looking for big crabs to call and reserve crabs in advance.We ended up ordering 2 small ones (each $55), trying pepper ad chili taste.The pepper one was great but it was less spicy than expected. much appreciated the smell and taste of the dish.The chili one was nice too, but the sauce was slightly more spicy than the other crab restaurant's recipe.service was good and attentive.we were offered aprons and help on cracking the shell when it was a bit difficult to crack the thick shell. Tho the kitchen did cracked on the shell to prepare it for eating before serving (a nice gesture).in terms of price, this place may be slightly more expensive, in a 10% range, comparing to other crab place.but the decent seating environment and the service were all well-justified
4
Had a group dinner on the recommendation of a co-worker so wasn't sure what to expect but it came thru. The debate of chili vs black pepper crab continued on to the next day. (Both good but black pepper was outstanding in my view). Other menu items were very good as well so something for everyone. Service was attentive and everyone had a good time. Definitely worth the trip.
5
The food was very tasty. We were a gathering of 20 and had a private room. The service staff were attentive...from the minute we entered the restaurant (all the staff greeted us along the way to the room!!!) Its a little expensive, but the quality was excellent
4
This place is crazily busy which must mean it is doing something right. The seafood is as fresh as possible. Great variety available at different prices which can reach stratospheric levels if you are not careful. The house special of pepper and salt prawns was absolutely delicious with plump juicy prawns that burst in the mouth. We shared a number of different dishes as one does in Asian restaurants and all were tasty. The service was pretty chaotic and their habit of bringing out dishes one at a time is most disconcerting for group sharing. Curiously they supply tiny paper serviettes which are practically useless, which struck me as bizarre in a.place of quality food. Nevertheless the place was packed on Friday night
5
We had the chill crab and the pepper crab and sweet and sour fish and all three dishes we amazingly nice and their bread was amazing to dip in the sauces. Price is high but so is everything else in Singapore. We paid almost S$350 for the above plush a rice dis and a green dish plus a jug of beer. Overall worth the experienc
5
Chili crab was delicious! Order with fried bread buns and asparagus . Great seafood menu. Not a place for non seafood eaters. Excellent fresh baby coconut
5
Good seafood and a decent option for vegetarian. Friendly service and interesting set menus available at reasonable price
5
 The place is unique in a very nice area in Singapore.When visiting Singapore I always eat there. Food is consistently great. Seafood is always fresh from the tanks in the restaurant - in case wanted, you can feel and touch the food prior to cooking.Place is due to it's performance always full - so I highly recommended to book a table in advanc
5
Extensive menu and delicious food. The crab is a must have both spicy and delicious. It also serves frogs legs. The only negative is that some of the dishes and even the drinks took some time to come. The staff is very friendly and quite helpful. And reasonable pricing
1
Very long wait for the order.Too much MSG in the cooking.We came as a party of 12, waited for over 45mins for the 1st dish. The dishes came 1 by 1 and 2 dishes we ordered were not available , also they ran out of fresh coconuts.Either to say we were very disappointed by the whole experience
4
Had one of the most delicious pepper crab ever. Spicy and delicious. As I was on a business meeting, we were seated with a group in a private box and that helps keeping conversations inside. Beer was served by the Tiger team! Had a 'smoking' good desert afterwards as well
5
We are seated with a cozy corner which has a nice garden view. Food is all good. Baby squid is crispy with dash of sweet sauce. Assorted mushroom with sio pek chye is unique with the taste. Not to say the lala hor fun is its house signature. The crab of course is the most fantastic dish.
5
The service is excellent here. It was our first time eating Chili Crab and some other unusual (for an American) seafood, and everyone was helpful. I prefer the pepper crab to the chili crab (a lot less messy), but both great. I think next time I will ask for pepper crab with a side of the chili sauce to dunk it in
3
Went to Long Beach for Chili crab with a group of 6 friends. The food was good but despite our best efforts the language barrier worked as a disadvantage. We asked several times how many crabs we would get and never were able to understand the answer. Food came out very slowly and one dish at a time to be split between 6 of us. When the crab finally came it was maybe one to 2 crabs torn up in a very soupy stew. Very much wok for very little crab meat. Communication was never adequate and we were stuck entertaining our friends as per how the restaurant wanted to serve us. We had to ask several times for napkins. Not Singapore's best. No offer of bread or rice was ever made / to enjoy the gravy with. But the Tiger Beer women come by frequently
5
Chilli Crab is the national dish of Singapore, and I know why - its fantastic.I can highly recommend Long Beach @ Dempsey as "the place" to get your fix of this soul food in Singapore.The starter courses are great, but don't fill up on them. Move right along to the main attraction. Although its called chilli crab, its not really that hot or spicy.The chilli crab is served with its shell pre-cracked so there is no need to use the nut crackers supplied - go for the claw which contains the best meat, but don't be shy to use the fried sweet buns supplied as a side dish to soak up the sauce. Chilli Crab: 94.00 Singapore Dollars - a bit pricy, but well worth the experience.We did not have space for the pepper crab, but there will definitely be a next time
4
We ordered the black pepper crab, it was a bit spicy but it taste good. The duck was very dry and it looks like left over food from yesterday. Taste awful.
4
We went in a group and were seated outside. Very nice. The food was typical and very tasty. Service was very good.
5
Chili Crabs by the sea in Singapore! We had both the pepper seasoning and the red sauce. I liked the red sauce with the rolls best. My husband liked the pepper version so we were glad we ordered both. We were glad we wore the bibs because this is a messy experience! You have to work for your food. Wear clothes you intend to wash afterwards
4
Brought an overseas visitor here for dinner and he liked the cozy and green location. We ordered black pepper and chilli crabs + fried mantou . We absolutely loved the black pepper crabs and finished these in record time, so we ordered a second plate. The chill crab paled in comparison although it went well with the mantou. I found the chilli crab on the sweet side and too gooey. The steam prawns were fresh and sweet and the fried kailan done to perfection. Overall, a very good enjoyable meal at reasonable prices
5
I love love love the food here. I used to come here when I was a student studying abroad in Singapore in 2009. I just returned for a trip with my husband and friends and was delighted to see (and taste) that the quality of the food remained the same. Great for large groups! Try the Singapore chili crab (make sure to get the bread to dip in the sauce) and the white pepper crab. If your group is large enough, order the garlic mussels and the black pepper crab as well. It's a short distance from the downtown area, but it's easy to get to with a cab or Uber. Highly recommend
5
We had family Easter lunch at Long Beach and it was another great meal. Food was very good - chilli crab was not too sweet with a nice bite, cereal prawns excellent, crispy squid a must. Service was excellent and Toni who served our table would be one of the best I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much effort and all with a wonderful smile. Well done!!
4
I craved Singapore based pepper crab and went here straight from the airport. While the staff were attentive the place definitely had a worn down vibe and a bit touristy without the benefits...a bit pricey and the food was ultimately serviceable but nothing grand to write home about. Go if you are hungry and in the neighborhood but don't make the effort to go if out of the way
5
10 people group in a room and a round table. We ordered many dishes including: Bamboo clams, chili crab and black pepper crab. With many other dishes. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The privacy that room gave us really helped the great atmosphere and we were able to enjoy each other company and the food.
4
Our group decided on seafood dining for our get together and the default recommenation was Long Beach, particularly the one in Dempsey due convenience in parking. I was treated to a great dinner of grilled squid with thick sesame topped sauce (really tender), an enoki mushroom dish, fried rice, a most flavorful black pepper crab which was tasty down to the last morsel and cereal canadian lobster which was sweet and meaty. What made our dinner more pleasant was the most efficient, friendly and courteous wait staff. Commendation for Ted, a cheerful young man who was all over the place helping the tables be served their seafood specialties. The place was packed - inside and out and was told this is normal in this restaurant. Dempseys is about 10 minutes from Orchard Rd, reachable only by taxi/car. The nearest MRT stations (Farrar Rd is one) can be quite a walk
5
Pros- Best black pepper crab for the money- Food overall is great for the price- Beer is cold and perfect after a long day in the Singapore heat- The restaurant sits on an old British military barracks, so the look and feel is original for the island and the entire shopping area sits on a hillConsiderations- Price: Like any place that serves these massive crustacean delights, be ready to pay around $90-100 SGD ($64-70 USD) for one- Location: It's a little off the beaten path, but still super clean, friendly, and where all of the locals eat- Reservations: Make a reservation if you can, because the place can be in full swing on a Friday/Saturday evening
4
authentic restaurant for great seafood. Famous for Chili crab, but also the lobster and the other dishes were great. Service efficient and friendly.
4
Went there with business friends for dinner, The Chili Crab was delicious, the other choice also good.
3
Lacks a bit of flavour. Good wasabi prawns. Chillie Crab was average have eaten better. Razor clams were good. Good tea.
5
Just get the pepper and chilli crab and fried or steamed buns.... yum. My husband and I finished 2 crabs (about $75 each) it was a big meal but worth the tummy stretch!
5
my favourite is the lobster cook 3 ways, black pepper and white pepper crab and order the chilli crab sauce by the side to dip with their special buns.. also the kampong mee goreng.. a must go place when i have client from overseas!
5
The best quality seafood I've ever eaten. This is a seafood lovers paradise. So much to choose from and always great quality. I can't go past the chilli or black pepper crab. A messy, finger licking feast of the best quality crab you will find. Squid, prawns, its all so good. Much pricier than your hawker food, but if your budget can manage it, give yourself a treat
5
Long Beach Dempsey has got to be one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long, long time. It's very much a 'get your hands dirty and stuck in' kind of place. We started with their signature black pepper crab and it was a real treat. Succulent, steaming hot and with just the right amount of spice!We also had the bean curd with chef's sauce, crispy duck, grouper, and durian pudding amongst other things. All of them a delight. The waitron staff are attentive and ensure that your Tiger Beer pitchers are never empty. A wonderful culinary experience. No wonder it's considered a Singapore institution.
4
Went here with a large group (20) and the venue and service were perfect for the occasion. One of our local Singaporean friends ordered a banquet and the food was all really tasty. Chilli crab was pretty good but lacking on the chilli front. Beer was Ice cold
5
Every time I'm in Singapore ,we go out with business friends to LB food is excellent ,pepper crab and lots of other choices. We always sit outside and enjoy the warm evening air ,especially for us Germans in our wintertime ;)This time I forgot my bag at the restaurant and only realized it when I was back my hotel. We have called the management and the manager Priscilla was so kind to grab the bag and stored it until I came for pickup.Awesome !... Tx so much 
4
My father and I met up with a friend of ours while visiting Singapore on vacation. His friend suggested Long Beach so we could try authentic Chili Crab and it was delicious! We struggled a bit with the lack of napkins because of how messy the food was, but eventually one of our servers sensed our despair and showed us the nearby cleaning stations. Thank god! Bibs are a must there so make sure to ask for one and extra wet wipes if need be
5
My absolute favourite and a must! I crave for their food and we went twice in 4 days for dinner! Excellent as always!
4
This was my second visit to this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Friendly staff and very good food. Their Pepper crabs are quite nice and worth the money.
Will be returning on my next trip!
5
The restaurant is pretty large in size with indoor and outdoor seating.
The black pepper crab was simply amazing. A must have if you are in Singapore.
The service is also very good.
Would love to visit again.
4
We ordered chilli crab with mantou it was great. For the fish it was supposed to be steamed grouper but we asked for fried fish with sauce n it turned out not too good thou. The service is good and staffs are very friendly. It's better to call for reservation before you come to the restaurant as it's often full house.
4
We had the set for 5 people, which included lobster cooked in white jade - so delicious, to die for. Crab in spicy tomato base is very delicious and we love the kampong noodles and the dessert is so impressive when carried out with the dry ic

Was taken to this restaurant by a fellow colleague. The food was amazing everything served was cooked perfectly everyone 7 out 7 did not have a dish they did not like. There crab is one of the best dishes to recommend. Will return to this restaurant again next time I come to singapore.

I always go there every time I go to singapore just to eat their Chilli Crab, Mantou and bamboo clams! And yesterday, 1st Of Jan 2017 we had their set menu, everything was good except the fish, it's soso. The beehoon with clam is so goood, tastes like homecooked food. :) the price is also ok :

Very nice casual seafood restaurant with outside seating on the terrace. Dempsey Hill is a trendy part of Singapore with some pretty colonial style bungalows. The restaurant serves great Singaporean (mostly Chinese) dishes with an emphasis on fish and seafood. Must try's are the black pepper crab, the steamed grouper in herbs. The atmosphere is casual and the staff very professional. A good choice for a relaxed meal in a leafy green outdoor setting.

There are more famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore but I like Long Beach for an overall great Chili Crab night out. I love the Chili Crab and fried bread with a few frosty Tigers. It's also convenient from Orchard Road and has plenty of parking. I've taken a lot of visitors to Long Beach and it's always been good
5
We make it a point to go once on every trip to Singapore. We were 6 so we ordered both the Black Pepper and the Chilli Crabs. I loved the Chilli but my son and daughter in law loved the Black Pepper. Hint: Your waiter will remove the meat from the shell if asked. (highly recommended) We all agreed the Royal Razor Clams with Garlic were spectacular for a starter and of course we had Fried Buns (to lap up the chilli sauce) Fried Noodles were perfect and the Fried Kailan with Garlic added to the treat. Draft pitchers of Tiger Beer and coconut / mango jelly to finish the meal. Reservation is a must

I patronize this branch a few times during a calendar year and food and service quality has remained consistent though it does falter when it is especially crowded. Good plus is free parking at Dempsey.

Everything tasted terrible. You get better taste in any coffee shop. Some dishes were just weird - bitter, too salty... The only thing passable was prawns - which were boiled.
5
The seafood was fresh, beautifully cooked and well presented. Everyone in our party thought it was superb.
4
I was there with some business colleagues to get some local seafood. The chili crab was great but for me the pepper crab was awesome. I was surprised by the intense pepper taste. So hot and remarkable! To ease the hot food try the coconut water. It became my favourite beverage at Singapore. The atmosphere was... Ehm... It was really crowdy and the plastic chairs don't feel comfortable. Anyway: if you love seafood, go there!

Long Beach seafood is one of the famous Singapore seafood chain. This one is located in the Dempsey park which makes it more convenient than the original on the south coast. Food is good and the location is nice. We enjoyed our chili and pepper crabs
4
We went to the Long Beach Seafood branch at Dempsey this week. The food was surprisingly reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Pepper crab was S$63 per kilo and beers were just over S$7 each (330ml cans of Heineken). The total bill for 3 persons with more than enough to eat was around S$220. Really not bad. The service was decent, and the waitress cautioned us against ordering too much instead of pushing extra on us. Atmosphere isn't fabulous but it's OK. Probably a much better deal than the tourist traps along Clarke Quay or Boat Quay
5
Its interesting to read the extremes of reviews for this place. I really liked it. Having visited Singapore a few times, I haven't yet found a better chili crab - I guess for my taste. The black pepper crab isn't as good as I have found elsewhere, but I go here to sit outside and eat crab, sauce and buns. It simply doesn't get any more complicated than that. I've not noticed the prices being particularly high and the service is invisible - its just about the chili crab
1
Made a reservation for a business group but we were seated under a fan at dusk with bright lights which attracted all sorts of bugs and we could not keep them out of our hair or drinks and so we abandoned all thought of eating here, also they offered one price for locals and a far higher price for non-locals and so would never return here agai

To eat crab and really enjoy it you have to get down and dirty. There's no way to not use your fingers. Without a proper protective bib you will ruin or at least stain whatever you happen to be wearing. Bibs are thoughtfully provided and discreetly tied around your neck here at Long Beach. And they are very necessary since you will want to get down and dirty with these crabs. The two kinds of crab we tried were the chili crab and the pepper crab, and I would recommend trying both. Sometimes chili crab can be so spicy that you miss the flavor of the succulent meat. I thought they got the spice just right here since it was spicy, but not so spicy that you didn't appreciate the high-quality of the crab. Both were delicious. A fresh shrimp starter was also delicious. The seafood is kept in gigantic tanks in the restaurant so freshness is guaranteed. A noodle dish we ordered late in the game was not quite on the same level. However, you come here to eat seafood not noodles. The restaurant is a bit out-of-the-way but taxis are very reasonable in Singapore. I think chili crab is a must to try here and this would be a great place to do it. Wash it down with your beer of choice. On a sidenote don't bother with the Singapore sling. I think it tastes like chewed bubblegum.

We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend and aware it would be expensive. We specifically wanted to try the Chilli Crab and the black pepper one but it was hard to judge how expensive these would be from the menu. The menu is very long and none of the set menus included both of these for only two people. We explained to our waiter and he said he would bring us two small crabs one of each type, we also ordered a rice dish, a vegetable side and some buns for the crab. For a drink we had a pitcher of beer. The total bill came to around €140 which was ok given we had been warned about the expense and had ordered two expensive dishes. Both crab dishes were nice but if you only get one the black pepper one was the best for both of us. On the whole we really enjoyed our meal. It looked like a place that was full of both expats and locals rather than tourists so a lot of repeat business. Given the chance I'd go back too
5
Excellent chilli crab. Good value with excellent service. We opted for a set menu with a couple of extra dishes which was a good way to have a selection of what is on offer
5
Hands down the best crab experience you can have in Singapore. If it gets better than this, you might have to revisit your standards. Wasabi prawn, Alaskan black pepper King crab or just the traditional Singapore style, served with ice cold Singaporean Tiger beer and staff that will make you want to go back two days later (just because you might still be to full to eat on the next day). MUST-TR

We read the previous reviews & were looking forward to dining here. What a disappointment. The restaurant is very tired looking with dowdy tablecloths, no napkins provided, plastic plates and some of the worst wait staff we have ever experienced. We chose a 5 course set menu for 4 of us and dishes were plonked down on the table in rapid succession, regardless of whether we had finished a course or not. The miserable waitress splashed us with sauces as she dished up & we had to use the tablecloth to cover our clothes as best we could. The food was poorly presented and whilst the razor clams and pepper crab were tasty, the rest of it was bland and tasteless. They rushed us through all 5 courses within 45 minutes. This was truely the worst dinner we have ever experienced.
5
I love the food here. From the soup all the way to dessert. Each dish was well executed - taste, presentation. The lobster dish with cereal was worth the extra calories. The chili crab is as I remember how chili crab should be made. The black pepper crab was rightly named Famous Black Pepper Crab :) The steamed fish was so tender, it just melted in the mouth. Even the roast chicken got raves from our dinner guests. Definitely will be back
5
This was one of the best seafood meals I have ever had in my life. Along with Restaurant Andre (where I ate during my last visit) this is my favorite place to eat in Singapore.We skipped drinks because we had just come from the rooftop bar at MBS and ordered the food straightaway. We ordered one of their signature set menus.The first course was Steamed Live Scottish Royal Razor Clam with Minced Garlic & Vermicelli and it was my joint-favorite dish of the night. It was followed by their signature dish of Pepper Crabs which was really really good and a close second in terms of taste and flavor for me. This was followed by Fried Leek Flower with dried scallop and olives which was average, I didn't really care for the leek flower. This was followed by my joint favorite dish of the night - Deep Fried Flat Rice Noodleswith ‘La La King’. The deep fried noodles gave the dish the perfect crunch and I just couldn't stop eating. Dessert was Rose Jelly Coconut Cream which was decent but didn't come close to the awesome dishes we had eaten earlier
4
Three of us ordered 1.2kg black pepper crab, kailan veg with garlic, deep fried calamari, and cereal prawns. All the dishes were very good with the crab being awesome. I recommend to get a plate of buns (fried or steamed) and ask the waiters to bring some extra Chili Crab sauce for 'dipping'. The black proper crab is a little more spicy and assertive on your tongue, whereas the chili crab is a little sweeter - I prefer the former. The meal came to about SGD $220 which is reasonable given the items. Be wary of them pushing their set menu which is a lot of food for about $120-130/head. Overall, one of the best crab spots in Singapore. The Dempsey area is great with lots of other dining and beverage options.
5
We had a good talk with the manager on the choice of the menu and she recommended us the set dinner and was happy to accept alterations to it, extremely service oriented. The menu for 6, though 4 of us were Europeans, was more than enough, had to bring doggy bags
4
I usually bring overseas guests to this place as they normally stay around Orchard Road. The old colonial buildings are always a conversation piece.The chilli and pepper crabs are always well received by my guests. I must add that they are actually fantastic and spiciness tweaked to guests preference! The service is also great....maybe since I am there often. And they serve my favourite Erdinger beer
4
The set dinner menu was excellent for a table of 10 and we could not even finish it all! Had to 'doggie bag' the left overs.The ambience was great and what was more excellent, was the attention being paid to the us by the service staff and especially one of the staff - Shirley Sun. She was a great and pleasant host to us all! She was quick and pre emptive to know our needs and wants which she never failed to deliver within a prompt amount of time.The food was good, not excellent but enough to satisfy our love for chilli crabs!I will visit here again with my family
4
Myself and son visited this place for lunch today. We ordered the following :-1) Margarita- the cocktail was just about average.2) Pepper Crab- this was awesome, the best part was that they shelled the same on request. Eating it without all the effort was superb. Fresh crab, succulent meat. Spice was just perfect and recommend for those who enjoy pepper and spice.3) Chilli Prawns/Shrimps- the chilli sauce or gravy and the perfectly cooked fresh Prawns are an awesome combination. Dip the hot, soft and really soft buns into the gravy and it is paradise.4) Veg/mushroom noodles- was just average nothing to rave about. The service was attentive and good. Prices are almost fine dining prices. Enjoyable experience
5
For the best seafood in SINGAPORE if not the world! Nothing like Alaskan King Crab flown in and marinated in delicious black pepper. What an amazing team dinner!
5
Expensive yes, however the world famous Singaporean Chilli Crabs do not taste or served better elsewhere. It's a must try if you want the real thing.
5
Stone crabs and tiger beer a winning combination at Long Beach Restaurant. Dine outdoors on the lovely porch and enjoy! I am in Singapore ever year for business and always make it here -- my 3rd trip!
3
Long beach has many branches but this one at Dempsey is my favourite. Easy parking, huge with lots of private rooms. Seafood here always fresh and great place for overseas guests who wanna try chilli crab or pepper crab!
4
As one of the most famous and expensive (relatively speaking) restaurants that serve pepper or chili crab, Long Beach has a big reputation to live up to...and it did deliver. We tried both the chili and black pepper crab which were both excellent. Would also highly recommend the fried prawns prepared using their 'house special' style as well as the seafood fried rice. While we didn't try the set menu options they seemed to offer decent value given the range of dishes it allows to sample. Restaurant offers also a range of other seafood dishes. Given its reputation the place was packed and reservations are required.
5
Be realistic about what you're looking for, you want a place that does seafood (especially crab) and does it well.We normally don't do set menus but the S$148++ menu had what we wanted after reading reviews, the Black pepper crab that this company 'pioneered' and steamed live razor clams. Easy.The razor clams came out in individual serves, surrounded by a fragrant flavourful broth, and a garlicky vermicelli with sweet clam meat. Delicious. The pepper crab was just as expected, peppery goodness with lots of sweet mud crab meat. Don't be shy to lick your fingers. When the staff offer to pick the claw meat out for you, take up the offer. It ended up being half a crab each person (4 pieces each).We didn't really expect much from the next dishes but the fried leek flower with dried scallop and olive was a good taste bud refresher after the crab, followed by a bland looking but very tasteful deep fried flat noodle dish with clams. Also a theatrical dessert of rose jelly coconut cream, dry-ice drama and all. Not overly sweet, by refreshingWe went on a weekday lunch after an easy simple booking via website and prompt confirmation via email the day before. It wasn't busy at 1pm, the staff were absolutely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was casual but the service was a notch above, dishes flowed seamlessly and the wait staff were keeping tab on our progress to ensure this (at a distance of course). Some reviewers complained about the cost but expecting to pay rock bottom prices for seafood just bc you can get a $4 meal at a hawker centre in this country is unreasonable, the price was comparable to any decent mud crab/live seafood restaurant in other parts of the world. Also, I don't understand why you would give a bad review based on your definition of what lobster should taste like at a restaurant most people choose for the crab. We walked from the Tanglin gate of the botanic gardens, 20 minutes in midday heat but next time we'll use uber, the Dempsey hill area has lots of little roads leading to other retail outlets so you could end up walking around a bit to find Long beach at the back
5
Most people told me about this place for chili crab and pepper crab. But I was warned that it was for "tourists". So I had mixed feelings but I still went over. I went for salty egg sauce crab, some green and noodles Hong Kong way. Wow absolutely fabulous, so delicious. Amazing taste whatever you take. Extraordinary! Plus the setting is great, old colonial house on Dempsey road, under the palms, in the green. Loved it
3
Good and convenient location near Orchard area. Nice environment away from the city with ample parking spaces. The place is crowded even during weekdays because of business dinners. If you plan to dine here advance booking is highly recommended.Food wise it is nothing to shout about. We had the usual chilli and pepper crab and tasted just like those in other restaurants. If you like the chilli gravy to dip the fried buns in, the chilli crab does come with a lot of gravy. Taste of steam fish is over powered by the spicy sauce. Sauce of the clam dish tasted just like that of chilli crab even though the waitress said it has sambal added. The silver fish fried rice was good though; very well fried with a little bit of crunch from the silver fish.Service was good even though you could tell they were struggling to manage. You can see diners getting impatient waiting for their dessert and bills toward the end of the night.Overall a good place for a business dinner but not for a family meal where you expect something special
5
It's been a long time since I ate at Long Beach Seafood. It's been a household name for the longest time. I was not too optimistic when I entered the restaurant because the interior looked jaded. I was wondering if the food and staff will be jaded as well. After my friends decided on what to have for lunch, we placed our orders-A 3.5kg Blue Alaskan crab cooked both ways-Chilli and white pepper, Geoduck sashimi, Golden Line Lobster, Fish Maw soup and veggies.The manager told us that there were only two Blue Alaskan crab and we took on of it. When the crab arrived we asked if they could de-shell it for us. The staff was more then willing and we were happy to hear that. Not only did they de-shell it they also played it nicely and we were impressed. When we tasted it-it was OMG! One of the best chilli crab we ever had, the meat was sweet and tender to the bite and the sauce was top notch bursting with flavors or the spices and chilies. Next can the white pepper crab and man it took it to another level! The white pepper sauce had a Nic buttery taste to it as we dipped the crabmeat into it and into our mouths. My friend who always had a judgement for most foods was speechless! I enjoyed that moment. Next came the Geoduck it was sweet and crunchy as a sashimi. They also told us to dip the other part of the geoduck into the double boiled stock to remove the smell. And it tasted so good but way better then abalone. Mind blowing! The lobster was good too and fish maw soup was delicious. Overall we had an excellent lunch and the seafood was top notch in terms of flavors and freshness. A must visit if you ever come to Singapore
3
Service very good and being new to the local seafood scene lots of help with ordering and recommendations. Chili and pepper crab very good as were the razor clams. Only observation is that is really is a very casual dining experience but at a high price point. Mainly catering to the expat and tourist crowd so lacked that local feel
5
The best and biggest Sri Lankan pepper crab ever. 2kg for 2 person to share. Steamed razor clam from Scotland. Stir fried Baby kai lan with crispy salted fish and their signature crispy tofu. Full with Great satisfaction!
4
I highly recommend the chili and peper crab. Good service and nice atmosphere. Although located in the center of Singapore, you are around nature.
2
If you want to be sad about how to degrade a decent lobster go there. Only the black peper crab is interresting . Service is at rush and place has no interrest . One time largely enough .
3
Open restaurant with private dining rooms available. Food is good and delightful. Winelist is rather limited. Service is above average.
4
Cant use words to describe how delicious of the food. You can try different crabs in singapore, this one with black pepper is highly recommended for those who love spicy.
5
The food is really amazing, as its freshly prepared and extremely delicious. We did have a small issue with the sambal chili used (Because it smelt wierd on the bass) but overall the experience is really amazing. The staff are also attentive and friendly, making the atmosphere really friendly
4
wow, this was awesome. messy, spicy crab but so worth it. we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer. service was great. didn't seem like a touristy place at all. my only complaint is how expensive it is. the crab and all the sides we had were great, but I wish it could have been a more reasonable price. oh well, everything in SG is expensive. I'd go back
5
Had dinner with friends and family last night. We enjoyed the Chilli Crab most with the Mantou or Chinese fried buns compared to the Black Pepper . Cereal Live prawn was so-so. A different taste from your usual "Zhi Char" stall. You have an option to have this dish with or without the shell of the prawns. We tried the one without prawn shell as we were lazy to peel them. The deep fried baby squid was yummy . My all time favourite dish when dinning at Long Beach Dempsey. Worth trying the Beancurd dish with Chef special sauce . Many thanks especially to Assistant Manager William and his team Man Yanyan who always takes good care of my family and friends . Service was excellent even though the restaurant was running full house yesterday . Remember to book table in advance to avoid disappointment especially the weekends. Private rooms are available from min spending of S$600 onwards ..
4
Thinking about seafoods at good restaurant at weekend in Singapore without a prior booking, forget it as there's always a long que at fully booked ones! I was lucky to have one table for at this rest. one week ago. The geo duck was fresh and great for shasimi, the black peper crab is the specility of the chain since its early day and still keeping to its fame! Tip is that you should book a few days ahead for weeken to get an indoor table and order everything you want from begining or wait for quite a time as it's too crowded! Overall it's worth the price
4
Was there for a business dinner and we started with deep fried prawn which is well seasoned. Next was cili and black pepper crab. The crab was big and I had the privilege of eating the claws. Personally for me black pepper crab taste better despite its more spicy. Steam fish with cili is okay and would prefer just plain steam. The scallop was soft and tender. The steam clam was cooked perfectly. The only let down was the fried rice which has not much taste. That was the only dish that was left nearly untouched. Overall it was a nice seafood experience and would recommend those who loves fresh seafoo
4
We went for dinner as recommended by friends.
The staff that attended us was friendly & attentive, however the food was just average.
5
Not many words required. Just go. Order the black pepper crab. It's simply delicious. Messy. But delicious. Don't bother with napkins. Get stuck in and just wash your hands in the basins later. Enjoy.
5
ScrubySnacks loves seafood and Long Beach did not disappoint at all. Every single thing we ordered was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. As per usual, we over ordered but spent many hours simply grazing and enjoying the wonderful vibrant atmosphere of the restaurant and fantastic service from their chirpy and entertaining staff. Highlights were definitely the steamed crab and pepper crab. The very enthusiastic waitress even helped to crack the claws open for us which made it even more enjoyable. The crispy mini octopus was also deliciously sweet and moorish. If you are in Singapore and looking for the very best seafood, ScrubySnacks would highly recommend a visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey. Cannot wait to return, next time with elasticated pants. And don't forget to wear the bibs as things can get a little messy, but don't worry, it's all part of the fun and experience.
5
We went on a warm evening, and glad we had a ceiling fan at our table. David Ng, assistant manager, really made some great recommendations. We simply had bamboo clams, Hongkong style steam Golden Phoenix fish, mushroom and vegetables. David shared that Long Beach has the exclusive Golden Phoenix fish in Singapore, all imported from Malaysia highlands. I was skeptical as this is a fresh water fish, but it really tasted very good. Will be back
5
We had dinner in this place in our second day in Singapore. A good friend of mine invited us there to taste Singapore as the locals do. The experience as great and the price very good. We had crab, prawns, soup, snacks and all very nice and nice taste!i recommend this place for good food and value!thanks for everything Mari
3
We dined on a Tuesday night but it felt like a weekend since all the tables were full and the place was very busy. We had some issues at the start with a server who didn`t understand English was was quite surprising since the place is so busy with ex-pats and foreign visitors. We tried many dishes and some were great - the Scottsh razor clams, Black Pepper and Chilli crab for example. Others like the steamed fish and prawns were fairly average. The steamed fish had been cut up away from the table and seemed to have been a rushed job since it full of bones. Service was slow throughout the night which was a little understandable with it being so busy. Overall pleasant evening but nothing to get over excited about
5
This is the place to visit if you want to try the local way of cooking the Crab Dish. Try the Chiili Crabs with buns or the Black Pepper Crab if you like spicy food . For children or adults that do not take spicy food , you could try the mouth watering salted-egg crab. The restaurant also served delicious seafood cuisine cooked mostly the Cantonese style. The restaurant is set in a exquisite location -Dempsey where many other restaurant and cafes are located too . Nearby you could also visit quite a few furniture gallery which sell very nice wooden items . Enjoy
5
There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore. Our family has visited the various shops of the various brands. Long beach at Dempsey Hill is top in our list. A bit further away from city centre but it is worth to spend the time on the trave
4
The Mecca for sea food lovers with the black pepper crab a must try! Loved it! The chilli crab palors before it. A special mention of the Singapore prawn curry, I loved it so much I bought loads of the curry paste to carry back with me. The place though has a peculiar smell but it is probably attributed to the sea food holding tanks which makes the decor of the restaurant.
4
Dempsey hill with all the restaurants, pubs and clubs is a very nice place to visit. During our last visit in Singapore we went to the Long Beach restaurant. The food was very good. We had the famous chili crab and several local dishes. We enjoyed it very much. Prices were also quite reasonable. Also for the beers and wine. Wine and beers can be very expensive in Singapore restaurants
3
Great place to experience the Singaporean cuisine away from the touristy track. We ordered the chilli Crab, amongst other specialties. The food was excellent but for some reason they are stingy on the hand towels for such a messy meal. It's well priced
5
Great food, fast service. A must for any traveller to Singapore. The seafood is excellent and a nice setting at Dempsey Hill
4
The name LONG BEACH has been a Singapore icon since it began in all humility on a sandy beach by the lapping tide in Bedok, long long ago circa 1970's. The original LONG BEACH was run by a couple who served up the most delicious chilli crab EVER! Today there are several outlets and this one in Dempsey is but one. It was my son's birthday and his dear wife organised (and paid for) our family dinner there. We got a private room, not a mean feat, (the lady has clout!)The food was delicious and a good meal was had by all. They have some children play equipment downstairs, should there be a need to entertain the little ones.Uber may be a good idea for carpark spaces are filled up fast
4
Another place we visited recommended by our friends. A bit crowded when we came, but our order came fast somehow. The chili crabs were really great, especially the black pepper. My wife and I ate so much that we were too full to move. Thankful for the waiter's (Adam if not wrong and he was just wonderful with his service) for his constant refills of water and suggesting the ice cream as dessert. Kind of expensive but we think it was worth it
4
We always try different chili crab restaurant every time we go to Singapore and so far, this is the best. We went with our friends, and forgot to tell them to serve the fried rice together with the chili crab and everything, not in the end (it's their culture to eat the cheap food in the end)
4
If you are new in town, check out Damsey hill and definately make a visit to Long Beach for their chilli crabs. Sure the place is a little pricey compace to some other places in town, but Once you taste that thick, glorious gravy with soft fried buns, you'll know it was worth it. They have some set meals which works out quite worth it for group dining as well
4
Early Saturday evening managed to secure a table for four even though we had not bookedOrdered the signature prawns, I really liked, but the family were not that impressedThe Black pepper Crab was a little slow in arriving bit worth the wait.Don't know why we have been before as just around the corner
4
Long Beach is a well establish local seafood restaurant and their Dempsey location is designed to be more upscale than their original place. The service is good and the location is easy to get to in the city. We had wonderful pepper crab which is my favourite dish. We also had a very good fried pomfret fish. Good place for local seafood when you visit Singapore. I actually prefer it to their beach location
3
So busy we hardly saw our waiter, and they had no time to explain things on the menu. Just told us what we should order. The chili sauce was too sweet for me, and the crabs we got had no roe or innards of any kind, so they were missing the best part. Way expensive for what you get
4
@TheKuoKnowsMany people will say there are only two names worth considering for the famous Singapore Chillie Crab. The truth is there are many.But my favourite is probably one of the two popular names, namely, Long Beach @ Dempsey.There are several Long Beach outlets. For some, the Dempsey outlet might not be as scenic as its more popular East Coast Seafood Centre. But it can be a lot easier to get to by public transport.Reserving a table ahead of time is recommended, especially at weekends. It can even be a good idea to book a couple of days in advance, if you prefer to dine in the comfort of air-conditioning.Long Beach's offering is quite extensive. But I generally stick with the set menus, which is more than adequate. The portions are generous to a fault. So a set meal for two should feed three quite comfortably. If not, just add an extra dish. I recommend the Coffee Ribs!Perhaps the toughest choice is whether to opt for the Chillie or the Black Pepper Crab. It really comes down to personal choice. For me, it always has to be the Chillie Crab, complemented with a portion of Man Tou to soak up the sauce.Long Beach is a credit to Singapore eateries. I have never been disappointed. I have never found the service wanting. I have never left the restaurant hungry! But I do always long to go back for more
5
Visit Long Beach @ Dempsey at the recommendation of my hotel concierge. Very nice and not too expensive. Food was great and staff was awesome.
5
We enjoyed a business dinner here and had a lovely experience in a private room. Fresh seafood in a variety of preparations, including a beautiful whole fish prepared to perfection.
5
We went there after a long day in the meeting and by 8pm they were full. Good that we have reservations. Of course Singapore is famous for their huge chilli crabs but this place also serve white peper crabs. Maybe for me chilli crab is now common, I kind of like the pepper crab more. It comes with additional white pepper sauce for those who likes the strong pepper aroma. My colleague who is vegetarian had to watch all those shell cracking but he insisted that his fried rice and shitake mushroom with beancurd were all very tasty too. The meal is supposed to end with a great dessert in durian pudding but unfortunately they ran out of it and we had to go with the mango pudding, which was good but you know, its not the king of fruit
5
Been to this branch of the franchise several times and always find it a hit due to the Dempsey Road 'upscale' dining location. Nice place to bring family and overseas friends to have seafood, get your hands dirty over chilli crabs and other yummy seafood. Can set you back quite a bit depending on what seafood you order and recommend to make reservations if you are going over the weekends but definitely a great dining experience.
4
I visited this restaurant with a group of colleagues as a special occasion. We had an excellent meal, with various dishes, including their signature Chili Crab. Each dish was well prepared and well presented. In the end, we had more food that we really needed, with the result that most of us ate too much. The ice cream and red bean sauce that came at the end of the meal actually helped overcome the feeling of "fullness". The only potential damper on the evening was the fact that the restaurant refused to call cabs for us when we were ready to leave
4
All I can say is they serve the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore hands down! The place can get real busy but it will definitely be worth the wait. Big plus for me was the Filipina who manages the table bookings. She got us a table inside where it was cooler.
4
Booked a private room as it was night out with colleagues. First time here, and I was very impressed with the quality of food. I would suggest booking a table outdoors if you enjoy the tropical weather.Try the Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Lobster salad!Downside though, the service was sort of disoriented as the dishes that were supposed to be appetizers came out late while the crabs came first. We were a group of 15 though, so I am not sure if it is the usual occurrence or a fluke. Nonetheless, the food was definitely worth it
3
..this is the place. I'm not a big fan of spicy food but the crab, fish and seafood we ate here was very tasty. Only downside is it's messy eating and lack of napkins so up and down to wash hands. Service was a little slow at times. Beer by the pitcher was good
4
Delicious: chilli crab (spicy yet subtle and not over-powering), deep fried baby squid, pork ribs. Nice touches: bibs and crab shells unusually well pre-cracked that further cracking was not need to get to the contents. Efficient and responsive service; perhaps being a weekend and not full helped. Pricey; as expected for fresh seafood

Friday night out with business colleagues. Food was good, not great. Service was just ok......prefer Jumbo Seafood, waitress not as helpful as we would have expected, but still overall fair to good experience. Don't think I will go back to this location.....just too many good rests in Singapore that act like they want my business
4
A good place for some authentic Chinese seafood a good menu that caters for all types. we were there for a quick business lunch. Good selection good service and the food experience and tastes were wonderful. Spend some time and try the menu.
4
Nice food, great service...what else can you expect? chilly crab is the best, and the shrimps with garlic lol....recomended
4
This place runs like a well-oiled machine. Good service, good food with the white pepper crab a standout. I have no idea about the cost because one of our group picked up the bill.
4
Was craving for razor clam and theirs are great, yummy. The crispy squid and tofu also yummy. The crab is ok, nothing special, same with all chilli crab. In overall its a good seafood restaurant, but reservation is highly recommended as its so crowded even at 6p
4
We had one of the set and overall the dishes are good. We had crabs cooked 3 different ways - chilli, black pepper and salted eggyork. The fish was fresh and the steamed prawns is cooked just right and juicy...just a little small for my likingRoasted chicken is good, aromaticThe fried rice (with small little fish on top) looked bland but packed quite a bit of flavor and I think there are small crunchy salted bits of fish in it tooFish maw soup was very watery, although not lacking in flavor.Had also the 4 combination starter - too salty for one dish and they are all fried, this is the lowest in my list from the meal.Veg with 3 eggs came very soupy, and I loved the soup!The stir fry veg with garlic is quite the standard fareI opted for their signature durian pudding for dessert. It is quite thick with bits of the fruit, but it was below my expectation as it doesn't give me the omph I was looking for.There was a big waiting gap between the crab and the rest of the dishes. Our plates got piled up very quickly with crab shell, but after a while the service staff got around quickly replacing them.Overall, the meal was very good as the +s are more than the misses.Will return

Good tofu, great pepper crab, but make sure they take the crab meat out of the shell because they will do a better cleaner job than you can! Get a table in front of the crab tanks for atmosphere. The rooms on the far side are lifeless and AC is too cold. Parking is easy outside. Im not sure the set menu is good value, we felt quite hussled into ordering it. Service is excellent
1
1st bottle of wine....not available....2nd not also...third time lucky. All the plastic chairs are dirty. Not what I expected from an apparently first class seafood restaurant. Very dated.....the people who own this restaurant need to think about the mouse analogy. Going back for the same piece of cheese that is not there. Could be so much better. Absolute rip off. Ordered a margarita and it was pathetic! How much do you want to cheat people. Great setting.....but crap

We hope this place is merely resting on past laurels, and hasn’t always served food this undistinguished and pricey. It’s not that the quality of the food is bad - it’s fresh seafood after all so how badly can you mangle it? — but the prices are stratospheric and the portions small. The pepper crab is the signature dish and for $50 for a medium portion, there was not much of it. (It’s brought from Sri Lanka.) A small side dish of a few pieces of broccoli was $12. The ambience is nothing special - a bit chaotic actually (which wouldn’t have bothered us if the food were more memorable). It seems to attract wealthy residents and people on expense accounts (for whom $200/four not including alcohol is normal) and tourists - who think they’re going to get something special (that was us). Give it a miss. There is much better food to be had in Singapore

It was a business dinner and we were allocated 2 private rooms with a great view of the greenery behind Long Beach @ Dempsey. Our VIPs from Europe and UK were very pleased with this view as we sip beers and discuss about various matters.Having been to Long Beach @ Dempsey for many times, it seems dishes served to private rooms are of higher quality in terms of flavor and decoration. At least, this time round, the food was excellent and our visitors very much enjoyed their meal to the last piece.The captains were attentive with our requests. They paid good attention to our VIPs, for example, servicing them with apron when the ever famous chili crab dish was served. Of course, they never forget us too! Fully pleased with the services.We will continue to recommend this place for Business Dinners if VIPs are interested in excellent seafood and peaceful greenery
4
The seafood is still good as before. I personally still enjoy the chill crab, still creamy and go very well dipping it with bread. If you want it spicy, you will be disappointed as it is not spicy. But the black pepper crab are more spicy than the chilli crab. The Thai style squid are chewy and with the Thai chilli sauce on it are not over power and the cabbage goes along well too. The bamboo clam cook with the garlic are well cook too.Average price if you want Crab, Prawn, Fish and squid are between S$60-90/perso
5
Long beach is ideal place for Chinese sea food lovers and a great hangout place for team and group dinners with quality beer and wine. We ordered lobsters and crab and it was awesome.
4
Chilli crab, pepper crab, clams with garlic to start! Fabulous! Don't forget to try the bread for dipping! We were lucky to visit with friends that helped us choose the best options!
3
A crowded restaurant with a few branches in Singapore. Famous for their crabs. The famous chili crab is abit too spicy. Slight expensive
5
Great food, good service. several choices of dining areas, indoors, outdoors, private rooms with AC. Book in advance. You can bring your own wine or sake. True Singapore Crab dishes.
4
This is one of my favorite seafood restaurant in Singapore, they serve the best crab. But my favorite is razor clam steam with garlic and the canadian live oyster. They have live alaskan crab woow
4
Had a family gathering with delicious food ! Have the Singapore chili crab - great sauce, remember to order the steam and fried bread to scoop up the gravy !! Black pepper crab - crab so fresh n well cooked. Try the cereal prawns - one of the best with so fine cereal crumbs n tasty fresh prawns. The service was prompt and efficient too. We will be back 
4
This is the place that we hold our Chinese reunion dinner@Chinese New Year Eve....Black pepper chilli crabs were as good as expected....they added new dishes into their menu....wasabi prawns and fried hor fun was real special and tasted really good....The atmosphere was nice and good attentive service....We will come back again next year....
3
I was looking forward to a great meal but was utterly disappointed. Lohei was not nice. The baby abalone, in place of salmon,tasted fishy. The bamboo clams were ok. The cereal baby lobsters were a bit too salty. The black pepper crab were too spicy. The clams were to appetizing. The fried rice tasted bland. Only saving grace was the dessert. I don't know what happen to them. Last year, I was still enjoying. Even their fried rice were tasty. It's a great disappointment for a place so well known and so pricey,

I was looking forward to try the black pepper crab and chilli crab as it was recommended to definitely try in singapore. My boyfriend was looking on tripadvisor and we wanted to go to the main restaurant but there was no table, our concierge recommended another closer to the hotel, but same company, so we booked. First of all they wanted to sit us, at the washing area, looked horrible, smelled bad, obviously I told them Im not gonna sit there...The restaurant is not cheap, and I was ready to pay for excellent food, and restaurant, but not on plastic chairs, watching the dishwashers gumboots and the cleaning process during my dinner. Not to mention, we dressed up nicely. They asked us to wait, the lady was not really helpful, after 10min we got a nice table. I was ready to forget the bad start, but.. The staff was NOT kind at all, it was around 8:30 pm, felt like they want to go home so much, waiting for the shift to finish. Nobody spoke proper english, at least those who were in contact with us. The crab was ok, but nothing amasing. At the end we paid about 150 EUR for 2 pax ( dinner and drink). Did not worse the mone
5
Had an amazing meal at long beach. Black pepper crab was so intense in flavour & the chilli crab was lovely and rich, it was such a shame to have to leave the rest of the sauce! We also had the whole peeking duck which I highly recommend. Having the skin taken off & rolled up into pancakes at our table then having the meet brought back stir fried over crispy noodles was one of the most memorable and tasty meals of my trip
4
Very tasty and delicious seafood. Great location, across from the Botanical Gardens. Nicely located in greenery with various bars walking distance for after meal drinks. Fast service. Definitely a genuine taste of Singapore.
5
Freshly made seafood some even taken live from the tanks, fast service that brings you the food in twenty minutes even long taking food like crab. Surely one of the best seafood restraints in Singapore and I encourage them to put out more branches
5
The Long Beach restaurant is still the best place for Chili crab or black pepper. Big portion, service is good and fun.
very fresh sea food. A great place to bring your oversea visitors .
4
Went there with visitors from Europe, did not expect much but was happily surprised. Nice service compared to jumbo, good crabs + rice + veggies + fish.
Only downturn... Very expensive... SGD110/head...
4
A staple with my family. Black pepper and chilli crabs are really good. Probably only in Singapore. Fried baby squid and belacan clams also v delicious. I particularly enjoy the thick and fragrant sauces. We had three 2 kg crabs. Huge and meaty. S$78 per kg. Very enjoyable
5
Basically, we echo what other reviews have already mentioned. If money is not an object, do go for a treat. Between my wife and I, we ordered 800g of Black pepper crab, deep fried fish (Yaw cham soon hock), mushroom and vegetable tofu and two drinks. It was S$168. It was pricey but the crab was the best we have eaten. What was surprising was the fish! It was so well done and tasty. Soft and fluffy with a simple but yummy soya like sauce. Overall, it was a real foodie experience. Unfortunately, there were no razor clams that day. A real disappointment. To be honest I have not tried others like Jumbo or many other places but I will definitely go on a foodie hunt next time we are back in Singapore. You might want to try their set menu which cost somewhat similar but you get desert. You might want to ask how much crap you get

Must have when in Singapore, Chilli Crab.Jumbo is fully reserved one week ahead, so no choice, we have to settle for Long Beach. This is our second time here after a year.We book table inside (Aircond) but when arrived was told no table inside so have to sit non Aircond table outside. Since they are packed all the time, its take it or leave it.As tourist, well, we have no choice!We order Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Fried Kangkung.Chilli Crab is good but not as good as before. Standard has drop. Black Pepper Crab is spicy but nice. Well, the meal cost SGD 305 (with GST) inclusive of Chinese tea and desserts, rather expensive! But it satisfied our Chilli Crab crave :-

We orignally were heading top Jumbo on Dempsey Hill but was convinced to try Long Beach for pepper crab. As it's the first time we've been to Long Beach we ordered the set menu with pepper crab. Wife was really happy with the food, where each dish was quite good and the flow was commendable. Started with steamed razor clam with minced garlic. Clam itself was fresh but a bit ordinary. It was however the garlic, shallots and soy souce that was memorable. Light and not to salty or pungent. Pepper crab was a bit spicey but better than Jumbo's. Ordered a mud crab, slightly smaller than what I would have like, where the crab meat filled the shell and was very moist. The noodles with clams was very nice too. Even the vegetable dish was a treat. All in all, I think we polished off everything served. A bit pricey but both my wife and I agreed when we're around Dempsey Hill we'd be going back to Long Beach over Jumbo in the future. Location is a bit of a problem as you need a taxi to get there and back. We asked the restaurant to call a cab for us, which worked out well. Could improve on the furniture and interior though as everything looked a bit worn. Other eateries on Dempsey Hill have a flasher look but less patrons. Couldn't hurt to update the presentation.

The interior in seafood restaurants in Singapore is generally not what you normally associate with fine dining. You sit on plastic chairs and you can forget about white linen. But no big deal – you go there to enjoy the crabs and eating them is a messy affair.Long Beach claims that they are “creator of the original and the best pepper crab of Singapore”. I am personally a big pepper crab fan but I don´t take tag lines like that for granted without my own research.As expat living in Singapore I have done thorough investigations across the island in my search for Singapore´s best papper crabs. My conclusion: the pepper crabs in Long Beach really are the best in Singapore. They are juicy, spicy and deliciously prepared.Case closed.In addition, Long Beach is a nice and an easy accessible place. Book table, take your time and enjoy your food.Not all seafood places in Singapore have the same attitude
5
We only had one night in Singapore on a stop over. We made reservations after we were recommended it by a friend from Singapore and we're glad that we did as this place is very busy. We went for the set menu and tried the razor clams, noodles la la and black pepper crab. It was all delicious...if not a little messy to eat! Would highly recommend, not too expensive. 148 dollars for 2 people set menu which was more than enough food. Full of locals and ex-pats, a taxi is needed to get there
4
Long Beach @ Dempsey is really easy to get to but do make sure you book as it does get very busy especially weekends and holidays. You can either request to sit out doors or inside the restaurant. Evenings in Singapore are pleasant so it's not a problem. I love the chilli crab so that's always one dish I order
4
I have been here a couple of times with my colleagues. Food wise it's slightly better than it's next door seafood neighbor. Their floor staff is always on the ball, ensuring you get what you wanted. Best to make reservation before heading there, opt for private room if you are spending more SGD600 per table. Private room able to combine if you have more than 1 table
4
I had the chili crab and it's as good as my taste buds expected . They say it's more known for black pepper crab but didn't have a chance to try it . The mango sago was just ok but bonus points on presentation . The crispy kangkong with cuttlefish was average ... I wish I had the baby kailan instead . I'll rate the resto 3.5 stars but rounded up since I put more weight on the delicious crab over the other average dishes and average service.
3
Came here at the suggestion of local friends to taste chilli crab. It was good, but not great. Better the pepper crab. Both priced at SGD 72. Also interesting is the razor clam, huge but overpriced at SGD 16 EACH. With some house prawns (SGD 30) and some side dishes, plus 5 Tiger beer, the bill was SGD 400, IMHO a bit excessive considering the cheap setting, paper napkins and basic level of service.Be careful not to take a table at the far end of the terrace or you might end up spending the evening listening to the karaoke next door..
4
Making the trip to Dempsey Road, near Holland Village is worth your taxi fare. Being welcomed by all staff at the front door and being ushered into the Restaurant surrounded by large glass tanks brimming with fresh and very active seafood.The initial "wow" was tempered by the extensive range of extremely fresh crabs, lobsters, fish plus anything else you can name. The sight of large live Alaskan Crabs is worth a visit without even looking at the extensive range of other seafood.Oysters - some of the best I have ever had and this comes from someone who lives on the Western Australian coast!The staff were attentive without being "in your face" and they had as much fun as we did over an enjoyable luncheon.Food prices very reasonable but, as usual, alcohol was expensive and no shock as this seems to be the practice - charge maximum dollars for alcoholic drinks.The visit to Long Beach was well worth it - great meal, great venue and away from the normal hustle and bustle of the city centre. Try it you will not be disappointed.
4
We came here with 9 people and had a private room. We got one of the 10 course dinners,more at least it seemed like ten courses. We had both the chili and pepper crab. Both were excellent. The other food was also quite good. The pudding dessert had a great presentAtion due to the dry ice. All of us were extremely satisfied.
4
I was taken here by people in the know. This is not fine dining, its rough and ready with plastic chairs. Service is fun and on it, really enjoyed the banter, although not completely sure anyone knew what was going on. So, we had some starters and then the main event which was Chili and Black Pepper crab. Strangely do eat the Chili crab first as the Black Pepper leaves your mouth numb. Fortunately some local noodle dish took away some of the numbness. My friends ordered some kind of fried buns which went in the Chili sauce and added to the yumminess of the whole experience. Cheap Plum Saki which was lovely, some good service and the night was made, The crabs were properly cracked and cooked, everything was very tasty, and there is a plethora of taps to wash up after right outside the door, bibs to protect clothes from splashes of the various sauces. Worth a try, great vibe and you have options to sit in or outside (depending on the Haze and the Heat
5
I remember coming to this restaurant as a kid, another time a few years ago with a friend, and now by choice. Their back pepper crabs is just something that will bring you back to this restaurant every time you are in town. It is made with such an incredible recipe that i could not find anywhere else in the whole world. You will never regret coming to this place even if this was the only thing you will order.The seating areas isn't the best in town but the food is definitely is without no doubt. just try to make sure you book in advance because showing up without a booking might disappoint you as it is always a full house although they have over a crazy number of table
4
Strictly speaking, there is one more restaurant that serves equally good pepper crab. That is Keng Eng Kee. But Long Beach is consistent. KEK is perhaps 80% of the time.Coming back to Long Beach, yes, This is the signature dish that you must try. Of course it has other good food, but those are merely good, not outstanding.Chili crab? I think Jumbo at Dempsey Hill does it better
5
Wonderful seafood! You won't be disappointed by the food, although I wish it would all come at once and not bring out the vegetable dish when we have almost finished eating everything else!The staff were very welcoming in this occasion and it was great that they shelled the crab for us. Note you get charged 30c for each towelettes you use and $2 for a plate of peanuts that you did not order, and they automatically add 10% service charge, but if you know this in advance then there are no surprises!You cannot beat the seafood here.... I will be back next time I am in Singapore for my next visit
4
I try to make it to Long Beach on every trip to Singapore - at least one time and more if I have the time. It is outstanding. Get the buns to smoother in the chili sauce - YUM! Service can be slow and inattentive (as they are busy) the place isn't that nice, but the crab is great - just go enjoy
5
Great food at a great location with great service, and with a little bit of history. There is a lot on the menu to choose from, and it's hard to go wrong. This is a place you want to put on your "must do" list for Singapore, not just for good food, but for the atmosphere. Outstanding seafood. The pepper crab, the shrimp and the sweet/sour fish were excellent. Sitting outside on the veranda in the evening, with the overhead fans going, and a slight cool evening breeze made this seem like a throwback to the old colonial days. (Probably a lot better food today than then, however.) The (relative) cool of the evening made veranda dining a pleasure. And they serve ice cold beer well: in refrigerated mugs. There's nothing like having an ice cold beer on the veranda on a warm evening, while waiting for an outstanding meal
4
We ate twice here during June and August. The fresh coconut juice, salt and pepper prawns, lobster, black pepper crab and chilli crab are all exellent. The atmosphere in the clearly very popular and busy restaurant is very lively. We all thouroughly enjoyed the food. Service seems rather brusque, but the restauant was extremely busy on both occasions. One one occasion we were billed for peanuts we did not have whichwa quickly corrected although with no apology and why in this quite expensive establishment do they charge for hand wipes, essential if you are eating the crab
3
it's my 2nd time visiting long beach. the restaurant here is not as fancy as the one in east coast. but the pepper grab is still star of the whole meal. crab is large and with lots of fresh meats. it cooks perfectly with super matches with pepper.mango dessert is another icon of this restaurant, but more on visual effect than flavor itself.
5
Long Beach is absolutely one of the best restaurants after hours of business negotiations. The noisy and busy atmosphere, the beer jug and the job with the crabs keeps your discussions not just in business but helps to get everyone relaxed. You can watch how the experienced waiter pulls the crab apart, don't even try to do it yourself. You are able to watch the fishes to swim in the aquarium which shows how fresh the food actually is. The service, well, don't expect too much of it because the restaurant is full of local people and the waiters are busy to serve those who are loud enough to get the attention. Some junior waiters don't even understand a word of English. Anyway we got very good service and good recommendations also about what to eat. Our menu was meant to 3-4 persons and it costed just some 250 SGD. A jug of Tiger Beer was 27 SGD. We were happy and will go definitely back.
5
The nasi goreng was excellent. So simple yet so good. Love the silverfish and the bean sprouts. The crunchiness was just right with the right amount of sodium that left me wanting for more.The fried kailan with garlic was amazingly perfect. It was soft and crunchy at the same time. Perfect texture. Not salty, not overfried. The cook really knew how to make fried kailan.Chilli crab was delicious. The gravy was cooked to perfection. I should have asked for a recipe
1
Wow, expected a lot based on reviews. Place is 100% packed, but service is very poor. We waited and waited for service. Not coming back, ever. Need to at least be friendly, maybe because we are western family? Sorry for coming here, what a let down.
4
Wonderful local Singapore fare. Had some fresh coconut juice to start then some amazing black pepper crab, chili crab, prawns, and local chicken. Veggies were amazing as well. Lovely dessert of a yam soup and fresh fruit. Make reservations as it gets packed. Sat outside and the breeze was wonderful. Plan on using your hands and being ok with that. Makes eating much easier so if you're "above" that sort of thing this isn't for you. Plenty of water bowls and wipes. Very attentive service and great food.
5
Great Place a bit out of the center. Here they serve seafood from around the world, also Norwegian crabs :). This is one high end place with stiff prices. But really worth a visit. Here one should try their speisalitet Pepper crab and chilli crab. Prepare for a delicious taste experience. But that said, this is not for everyone's wallet
5
The Dempsey area is a bar and restaurant complex that contains many options. Long Beach is a definite highlight. Although it is hot they offer al fresco dining on the veranda, an inside area and private rooms. How much you like your chilli may determine whether you choose to sit outside.The menu is long and varied. You come here for the crabs of course but our starters of crispy mini-squid, razor clams and sesame prawns were fantastic.We had two crab dishes - in chilli sauce and pepper. You get plastic gloves and a bib to eat this course and you have to dive in with your fingers. The crab claws are as big as your thumb and index finger, meaty and delicious. Both dishes were amazing but for me the pepper crab just edged it - all washed down with ice cold Tiger beer. A great sign that so many Singaporeans eat here, although service may be a bit rough and ready for some! I loved i
5
Pepper, White, etc. The outdoor and porch dining is also a plus! The stinky pudding is another thing. A MUST GO destination in Singapore.
4
Really nice chinese cousine. Very rich menu and fantastic sea food. One of the best crabs in Singapore that I tasted. Service also very fast and professional.
Place to go back.
5
Excellent seafood restaurant on Dempsey Road. Try their freshly boiled king prawns and pepper crab. Delicious.
5
Our concierge recommended this restaurant. It did not disappoint. Delicious food, friendly, helpful staff and coeliac friendly. Whole mud crab for $72. The place was full of locals and the food very fresh. Definitely recommended.
5
A big thumbs up for the service and food. First of all, surroundings fantastic. Restaurant set among old colonial buildings in Orchard area. Though a bit remote to reach without a car but a great place to visit to have a totally different feel . Food is super delicious . Crabs are really fresh and cooked to the right texture and taste. A must try is the black pepper crab and the salted egg crab. Though slightly pricey, but it is still worth it. Recommended strongly especially for a great family day out
4
We had chilli crab, chilli squid with convolvulus (kangkong),clams with hor fun noodles, deep fried marinated baby squid, a special bread (fried man you) to go with the chilli crab sauce and bamboo clams with garlic. My friend ordered the dishes and she is very familiar with the restaurant. Service was average. They tried to give us someone else's dish and we had to remind them about one of our dishes.The food was generally delicious. The dishes were not garnished or presented in an attractive fashion. You can byo wine. Seating includes air conditioned area indoors and al fresco outdoors. The tables are packed closely together. Restaurant is small and it is fairly noisy. Little ambience. Worth going for the seafood itself especially the crab which was meaty. They serve a large variety of crabs, some of which are air flown in from overseas eg Canad
5
You can't visit Singapore without trying the Chilli Crabs and the best place to get them is Long Beach at Dempsy Hill. I have had them at other places in Singapore but this tops them all. And while you're at it get an order of the razor clams as an appetizer
4
We asked the concierge of our hotel where we could get the best Crab in Singapore. Long Beach Dempsey was the recommendation and we were not disappointed. Not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded!Bustling, full of locals and whilst the service is no fuss the wait staff were happy to take time out to explain the dishes. They took pleasure in your curiosity and enjoyment.Exceptional value for money
3
I have celiac disease and wasn't able to get clear explanations of which dishes are gluten-free or can be prepared that way. I took my chances on chili crab (the server said it had no soy sauce) and greatly enjoyed it. I didn't find much else I could safely eat
4
first time come to this restaurant, we ordered a dinner set for 10ppl, size is big enough, indeed we can't finish all dishes. Black pepper crab is hot and spicy, taste fresh. Curry crab come with fried buns, dip curry, u really want to eat your all fingers. Staff are good service and very sincere. Worth to come with your business partners
4
all was great. We visit the place every year with my family. I can't wait to get back , next year, hopefully. I reccomend 100%
5
Chilli crab is a must......dose the sauce with the steam bum. Main dish will feed 3-4 easily. Great atmosphere (outside is better). Service is fast and pacey. An icon to always visit.
5
Got a set meal with lobster and Black Pepper crab the food was delicious and the crab went well with the Erdinger beer. Good atmosphere and service will definitely come back when Income back to Singapore.
5
This is a must while visiting Singapore, the seafood is prepared in an unique way-tasty, elegant, not sparing products, simply delicious
5
I was invited for Sunday lunch here. Exceptional seafood including sharks fin soup. The chilli crab was mouthwateringly delish and I'm not normally a crab fan.
1
When we arrived we stood around to be seated and no one seemed very interested. We were put at a table at the entrance which was windy and unpleasant. The service was shocking. Our food was cold and not at all pleasant. Onto the bill they added extra costs for the peanuts that were on the table and 2 dollars each for paper serviettes. It really was a dreadful experience after having been recommended to us
3
We had 3 tables of 10 and ordered a set dinner. The giant clams, pepper crabs and roast chicken were good. Fish, fried rice and mango dessert were ok. Service is mostly fine too. Like some restaurants and coffee shops, the beer is outsourced to a 3rd party and you have these grouchy ladies hawking and serving beer. Near the end of our dinner we stopped the flow of beer which kept coming, since these ladies probably earn commission. Despite our stop instructions , they kept giving us jugs of beer and refused to take them back. Rather annoying. Before we got the bill, we had to speak to the manager to cancel the untouched jug
5
Looking for great crabs to match your wine? Long Beach at Dempsey is super highly recommended...we ordered crabs that were prepared in 2 different ways. Most people would order the famous Chilli crabs with mantou(buns that are either steamed or fried), but what we ordered are crabs cooked in white pepper and the other one with salted egg...it is a "must try"...we paired it with a great French white..Puligny-Montrachet...what perfect pair...another highlight is their unforgettable Crispy Duck paired with great red wine...it so crispy that you can also chew its bones..no exaggeration... I can go on and on and on...the best thing to do is just visit Long Beach at Dempsey especially when you have foreign guests. You'll never go wrong. Bon Appetit
5
Even though Singapore is famous for Chilli crab ... the pepper crab at Long Beach was awesome .... I think better than the Chilli Crab. We ordered the Pepper Crab and the prawns with chilli crab sauce. Both great but the enjoyed the spicy pepper crab more. Must do. Open till late. One of the few place in Singapore
4
This is our favorite restaurant for my family reunion dinner every year for the past 3 years. The food was fantastic on every dishes. Black pepper crabs is a must and never fails us with its consistant quality.The service was good as we were lucky to book a VIP room. The fish and other seafood were very fresh and of course the main lo hei dish also very good!
4
Recommended for sea food lovers, others find some other place. Crab is the specialty, prawns were good, rice and tofu okay. In January the weather holding, outdoor ambiance is great.
5
We went there twice during our trip, recommended by our local friends. The service is great. They are honest with weighing the market price seafood. All dishes are tasty. We like the Razor clams with garlic. The prawns in herbal soup is also good.
4
well, if its your first time in singaporeor the first time you about to try the chilli crab, it is a go to place for you..I like the blackpepper crab better than the chilli crab but always love the fried bun that comes along with it tho'..Overall food was great..I dont know about the pricewise because I didnt pay, LOL...But worth to try if you come in a big group
4
They have package menu which we took for 5 pax. Cost slight above S$300++ and what we got was prawns, steamed tilapia, roast chicken, a mushroom & veggie dish (i thought this was really good) in some white broth, 2 large chilli crabs with fried mantou, a plate of fried rice and a bowl of yam like dessert. Had a pretty enjoyable meal but would expect a better fish than a Tilapia which they gave us an option to upgrade it to a promfret at a price. We declined so didn't find out how much. Not sure if this is a reasonable price in Singapore but coming from across the border, I thought it was pretty expensive
4
I have eaten Long Beach for a long time. It's always best to have a proper master head chef in the kitchen. I come here once a week for dinner, sometimes more often. The crab quality is usually excellent, whether chilli or black pepper. They have other great dishes, and some seasonal ones too. Call to book in advance, else you will be disappointed as they are usually fully booked.
4
I have always liked Long Beach Seafood @ Dempsey. Be forewarned, if you can get out of Long Beach for under $60 per person you have not experienced their black pepper crab or chili crab-and you definitely haven't washed it all down with a beer. I suggest going at lunch as they actually remove the entire crab from the shell. I also like to sit outside on the veranda. This is always an experience. One recommendation--bring your own napkins, towels, and/or go into the restroom and grab a stack of paper towels. These are seriously messy dishes and the restaurant will provide the equivalent of a tissue and wetnap for the end of the meal. BTW-- Long Beach is much preferred to No Signboard and several locals highly recommended Hua Yu Wee on the East Cost for crab which I did not get to

Scrummy delicious food. Beautiful octopus to start, seriously tasty white fish (can't remember the name), and to crown it all a wonderful red chilli crab and a a white pepper crab. We also had some chicken, vegetables, rice etc. Dessert was a mango pudding in a smoking glass which was a real treat too. Just wonderful. The taste, the quality, the quantity - all fabulous. Will be returning to try the black pepper crab too. The service was excellent, many waiting staff and the food came pretty quickly so not too much waiting. A good selection of wines also.Definitely worth a try

I've lived in Singapore for 2.5 years and went on a crab quest (self-assigned) to crown a champion for all preparations of crabs. After extensive (and extremely pleasurable) research, I can say with surety (after 4 visits to be sure of consistency) that the black pepper crab at Long Beach Dempsey is the best in the land.If you want a monster crab (2 kgs or larger), call ahead and reserve the crab when you reserve the table. Otherwise, the crabs will more likely be in the 1 kg range, which is still quite large. Generally, I prefer sitting inside because it can still be pretty hot outside at night.Unfortunately, the fried buns, a Singapore crab staple, are only OK, but you don't really need them with black pepper crab.Other side dishes are great too, but the star attraction is the incredible black pepper crab

Our friends came from Hawaii which is known for its fresh seafood - but they were completely in awe of the freshness and variety of the seafood we ate at Longbeach. Call ahead and order some of the dishes you like - the Razor Clams, A Steamed whole Fish, Black Pepper Crabs...to name a few!Reservations are a must. And they have big private rooms too. Friendly staff and a bustling place

hi i was dragged by my friends here at Long Beach dempsey hill last September...enjoyed the Chili Crab and the freshness of Lobsters..if you feel bored on weekends and feel like eating anything from the sea., Long Beach is the best place at Dempsey Hill..Well Don
4
The chilli crab here is to die for.....just super along with the fried bread rolls. Their fried rice is a must have and the chef's special prawns too. This is the BEST place for chilli crab so don't try any other place.
4
I had my first chili crab @ Long Beach, was finger-licking good.
But what's better were their drunk shrimp soup and coffee pork!!!!
Would love to go back if i am in Singapore.
3
Drunken prawns in a herbal soup broth and bamboo calms is to die for. The warm herbal broth was delicious,. I strongly recommend this to any first-time diners to Long Beach! Disappointed with long beach's seafood at Dempsey. Somehow i think the outlet at east coast is better. The chilli crabs we had didn't seem very fresh, and the sauce was all watery. Black pepper crab was the star of the night. It seems like its targeting more for tourists, Service is so so, fish soup, yes it taste good but very expense.For a restaurant that pride itself with seafood and crab.The crab meat was not firm at all and its claw meat was not body fill,for the price we paid it was robbery on Dempsey road
3
We had black peppered crab of which the black pepper was so overpowering that we could only feel the texture of the crab meat but not its freshness. The fried clams was only fried with black bean sauce which gave it a monotonous taste. Normally,clams are fried with black beans and chilies to give it some layering in the taste. However, the restaurant was still jammed packed with local families and expatriates. I think people go there for reminiscences on good time with families and friends more than for the taste of the food
4
It's always easy to be positive when someone else pays, which was the case for this visit. That said, we enjoyed our evening very much. We were a large group (9) in a private room. After the appetizers we moved on to chili crab which was delicious. The accompanying sauce was quite thick and tasty. The large prawns were really very good. We also had a chicken dish and fish, both of which were good. The small bowl of fried rice nicely completed the main part of the meal. Desert was presented in a small bowl placed on top of a larger bowl of green liquid with dry ice so that frosty vapors were pluming from around the mango custard. Quite well presented and fun.I understood that the cost was around S$100 per person including plenty of Tiger beers.Definitely worth a visit, even at one's own expense
3
Went there for both chilli and pepper crabs. Chilli crabs taste good but pepper crabs are disappointing! It is too oily and wet! Need to review this dish or it is losing customers to Jumbo! In fact, I brought a group of six last week to Jumbo instead of Long Beach
5
Serving 500 pax every night, this restaurant is pumping out crab dishes left, right and centre. It's busy, but the service is fast and friendly. We picked this crab restaurant over the others because they will shell it for you- meaning it's not as messy as usual! Lazy, perhaps, but worth it as I don't like eating crab to feel like a work out. The manager showed off the Alaskan crabs (at $800SG a pop), but we settled on a Sri Lankan version. Worth a visit- it's not fancy, but it's a lot of fun.

I decided to celebrate a birthday at this venue and selected their “newly created dishes menu, ” Set Menu C. This entitled me and my guests to a private dining room.The room, situated at the end of a long walk through the restaurant, was small, simple in decor, carpeted, sufficiently cold and had good lighting; with thin sliding doors and walls, so that the noise from guests in the other rooms was very audible. Service was attentive and efficient. Below is the list of dishes that came in descending order:Long Sheng live lobster: Each person was served half portions; the lobsters covered in buttery batter. Meaty and rich and had quite tasty flavors. Chili Crab. Crabs in generous amount of tasty tomato-based sauce with the aromas of curry leaves, flavorful and very nice with two plates of fried buns to lap up the chili crab sauce. Buns are additional at $5.50 each plate. Live Prawns in Japanese Sake. We found the presentation unappetizing, looking like the prawns were simply tossed on the plate. The prawns, medium-sized bordering on small, were over cooked, the flesh sticking to the prawn shells.Famous Pepper crab, hot and peppery. One of their signature dishes and a favorite.Steam Live Sea Bass in Lemon Thai style. The fish was very fresh and the meat firm. Strong lemon flavors which I found refreshing. La La King with dried shrimps and chili padi: was a ‘small dish’ in terms both of edible quantity of meat and clams for 10 persons. The sauce tasted similar to the chili crab sauce minus the curry leaves, and the clams tasted fresh.Handmade Bean curd with Chef’s Sauce. The dish was nicely presented, but there wasn’t that Wow! factor to make it outstanding. The sauce was thin and gooey, and wasn’t tasty. A dish that could be missed or skipped.Crispy Duck. We had a huge fat duck, plenty of meat and crispy bits. Fried to perfection. The meat was not dry or too saltish.Country style Brown rice noodles: We found this very saltish. It was compounded by the salted dried shrimps bits making it even more saltish! Not many of us could finish the portions we had.Desert Mango pudding was served individually. It caused a stir because of the presentation in glass vessels containing dry ice in green water, billowing white smoke as the dish was laid on the table! However, the pudding itself was a huge disappointment. Dry and too firm in texture for a pudding. The taste was unremarkable. It was a struggle to finish our deserts!The two plates of appetizers were charged $6.00. Because we had 11 persons and needed an additional lobster, there was an addition of $56.00 for this. The Set Menu C was packaged at $768.00 ++. There are also charges for tea and towel with the usual Service Charge and GST.Generally, a pretty heavy meal, with six out of eight on sea food dishes. I would prefer next time, to go with an ala carte order. There are other sea food dishes in their menu that have been time tested and found to be favorites. This menu could do with a vegetable component and some of the dishes in this new “ Set menu C.” needs, in my opinion, further work to improve on.

Slightly smoky like it was off the BBQ added a delicious layer of flavour. Their special prawns were also excellent, eat the shells and even the heads if you are game! Loved it but beware of the price ++ as this adds plenty to the cost
2
I never like giving negative reviews but I think it is important for those thinking of having a meal at this place to save their money and time especially as there are so many better and cheaper restaurants to pick from. The food was just there, the service was poor and focused mostly on getting us fed and out in the shortest time. I really advise thinking twice about going to the Long Beach. We got a definite feeling because we weren't locals we weren't really welcomed. As for the chili crab, you will do much better for far cheaper at just about any Hawker stand
5
As per my title....the Black Pepper Crab is simply amazing.
Word of warning. This restaurant is very basic (albeit great food). And bring lots and lots of your own wet wipes and napkins because you will need them.
4
Love the chilli and pepper crab! Fried baby squids is excellent with beer!
Dislike the queue if you have no reservation.
4
Having eaten at quite a few famous crab restaurants in SGP, i have picked the Long Beach Dempsey's Chilli and Pepper crab dishes as the best among those i have tried.Their 'house special Prawns' is a must try and so is the garlic baby kailan.The presentation of the Mango and Durian puddings looks better than they taste, even with them tasting pretty decent.Def will go again..Visited this place like a 100 times with the most recent being in Aug 2014
2
If chilli crab is the national dish of Singapore then Long Beach is guilty of unpatriotic acts against the state. At least the crab was super fresh but the dish was quite disappointing. The crab was served covered in a sweetish-chilli-egg sauce which was poorly executed. I think success has ruined this restaurant. I have had much better chilli crab at small hawker stalls and even from my own kitchen. My recommendation is give this restaurant a miss
4
The food is quite good - especially the chili crab and black pepper crab, but frankly the leading seafood houses (eg. Long Beach, Jumbo, No Signboard, etc) are exploiting their fame (busloads of tourists or vans full of visiting businessmen descend on them!) to charge very high prices. You can have as good seafood at much lower prices at more out-of-way eateries
4
The food was great as always but what was surprising was the exceptional service . We were not looking forward to this meal as the last time we were here the service was horrendous . Something must have happened bec the service was faultless. Water n tea glasses were topped up without having to ask for it . Plates were changed between courses. They even offered to peel the crab shells for us ! What a breath of fresh service air !! Well Done Long Beach !
5
Great Seafood Restaurant. The best chili and black pepper crab we had in a long time. All the other dishes we had been all very tasty and yummy. If you are in Singapore it is a must that you try this restaurant out for their great seafood
2
I went to this restaurant with my wife on 12/9 . (Table 18 ) we ordered a fixed price menu S$ 138 for 2 persons . We were told by waitress Ms Liao Gun Hui that fixed menu crab is usual weighted 1 Kg but tonight no 1 Kg crab is available . We were told to pay additional S$ 30 for a bigger crab which weighted 1.2Kg . I refused and talked to the Service Manager . She immediately apologized and told us 1 Kg crabs just arrived at the restaurant and is now available at no extra cost . All happened within 3 minutes ! I suggested to the manager to remove the fixed price menu because it is not right for waitress to increase fixed price menu as she likes. I certainly would not pay extra $10 in McDonald for a fixed price meal. Be careful with this restaurant . For me , I will not go back to Long Beach because there are plenty of good and honest restaurants in Singapore .
4
We had dinner there in late August and we went there for their famous crab of course.The black pepper crab and the red chilli crab were indeed superb, as was the service. We made a reservation for 6 persons but were 10 persons in the end. Even the restaurant was fully booked, they arranged a bigger table for us in no time and service was always friendly and attentive. Though the crabs were really big and succulent, I feel the price was a bit hefty (around 1200 Singapore Dollar). I had excellent crab in a less exclusive setting at much lower prices in Singapore before. Also it was a bit of a let-down that they did not serve stingray, which is a real delicacy in Singapore.Nothing bad about the food or service, but next time I will probaly go to a less exclusive place enjoying similar excellent crab (and stingray!)
5
As a group of six persons we enjoyed their chill crab and pepper crab tremendously. Finger licking good. Also their puddings and jellies for desert, especially the durian one, delicious. Friendly and helpful service personnel, especially when it comes to help us cracking the crabs open. The atmosphere is laid back but attentive service staff who doesnâ€™t mind going the extra mile. Definitely a place to go back to and enjoy more sea food
5
Outstanding service with a smile. The presentation of food aand assistance from servers was great. Worth a repeat!
5
We had chili crabs and pepper crabs at a business dinner. The crab was great. Very good prawn chow fun as well. If the weather is good be sure to sit outside. I like this place.
4
We went here for dinner after a business project and was very impressed. We had chili crab (really good), black pepper crab (really, really good) fresh prawns, some coffee pork dish and some veggies ... everything was really quite excellent!
5
Crabs, prawns, fish... what's not to like? The best black pepper crabs I've had in my life was at this seafood restaurant. It's finger licking delicious! The atmosphere is nice and laid back. The choice of food is wonderful. I'll definitely be coming back here.
5
I went in this restaurant with Colleagues. Our Host ordered for us traditional Singaporean food : Prawns, prawn cake and many other dishes. One outstanding was the Black pepper Crab !!!
It is tasty, spicy but not too much, and kept all the Crab taste
5
Great place for chilli and black pepper crabs and other Singaporean delights. The food is delicious. Some of the wait staff may not be the friendliest, but worth going.
4
Singapore's famous Chilli crab is something you have to indulge in. It is spicy, it is messy, it isn't the cheapest meal out but it is worth every dollar, especially here at Longbeach @ Dempsey, a wonderfully transformed colonial building in lush surrounds. A great laid back spot to watch the live crab tanks, enjoy some cold Tigers and mop up Chilli crab goodness with delicious, sweet fried buns.
4
This place was so good I went twice in 5 days. Originally taken as a guest of a local, we ordered the house specialty prawn (excellent dish), pork ribs and the famous black pepper crab. All meals were excellent but the crab lived up to the reputation... Went well with a nice cold jug of tiger.Atmosphere is very casual and relaxed and perfect for a warm evening - will be back.
4
The black pepper crabs and chilli crabs were excellent. Be sure to order the buns to soak up the generous amount of gravy that comes with the chilli crab. It gets crowded during dinner on weekends and it would be advisable to make a reservation. Pricey but superbly done and fresh.
4
Long Beach@Dempsey is one of my favorite restaurants to entertain my overseas friends. This restaurant is very popular among locals and tourists and best to make reservation. It gets really busy during dinner time so be prepared to wait for a table, for walk in customers.I always order black pepper crabs which Long Beach is well known for. A few of my favorite and familiar local dishes are : fried sambal kang kong, roasted chicken, Fried beancurd, sauteed prawns with salted eggs and baby squids.
4
The seafood is very tasty and well priced. Service is courteous and prompt. However the setup is very low key - plastic chairs, no bib for covering the shirt etc. If you want tasty good definitely try this.
4
Nice seafood and ambience. Try the pepper crab. The service was good and they even tried to remove the shells from the crabs for you even if the place was crowded.
5
We generally visit Long Beach at East Coast Seafood centre but thought that we would try a different outlet on this occasion. The venue is very interesting - an old army barracks. We sat on the verandah which was very pleasant. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed it very much indeed.
4
This is actually the second choice by my sis when we visited her. Jambo is her first choice but it's fully book, all the branches!Ordered Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roast Chicken, Beancurb and lala noodles. Crab is big (1kg or so). Very good. Roast chicken is good too! In general, good food.Remember to order dumpling to soak up the chili crab'a sauces!Service wise is good as well. Reservation is a must as this is also popular place
4
Having visited Singapore many times and not had a chance to try this must have experience I made sure to tell my friends to put in our must do list this time!!! The toss up was between Jumbo and Long Beach with many friends being either fans of one or the other ….. The one we went to in the end was Long Beach … the Dempsey branch as both Jumbo and Long Beach have multiple branches ….. The Dempsey area in general has really developed into a great area with eateries and cafes bustling throughout the day and the night. The two must have dishes the Chilli Crab with the fried Bread and the Pepper Crab we ordered of course with extra pepper sauce on the side (which you have to order separately to dip the crab in for the full experience). Apart from these two dishes we ordered the butter prawns and the steamed sea bass in soy sauce. The place itself is one of those mass production eateries which have a formula and do large turn arounds and fast service …… The food started to arrive pretty fast and we put on our bib's and picked up the crab cracking utensils and got to work !!!! The Chili Crabs and Butter Prawns came first …. the Pawns were really good and hit the spot …. the Chili crab a bit Challenging to get to the meat for a first timer but once you did was definitely worth the effort. The Fried bun with the Chili sauce was also really really good ….. The Pepper Crab ( we ordered the black pepper …there is also white pepper crab which is supposedly also pretty good) which came had a completely different flavor and the friends kept asking which I liked better …. my answer was i liked the variety both were excellent and the combination was amazing ….. the steamed sea bass with soy sauce was also good but both the crabs being the hands down winners ….. A definitely must do experience in Singapore!!!

NIce setting in Dempsey Road. There's a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. Here's what we ordered:1. Steamed Soon Hock - Well prepared and fresh2. Sri Lankan crab - Full and well prepared3. Half chicken - Well prepared4. Poach prawns - Fresh and well preparedCombined this with gracious service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng:1. We were initially allotted a table in a tight space. She moved us to a bigger table when it became available.2. Due to misunderstanding, she allowed us to change our initial order without any fush. Most other places would simply say "Already prepared".3. Other staff members are attentive and gracious. Perhaps because of their prominent name tags which provide them with an identity and pride in their work.Overall a great experience. We spent $380 for a party of 5 adults and 2 kids. Would say it is value for money. If the management is reading this, please pass on the compliments to Jenny Cheng and her team
4
From the iconic east cost place, the Dempsey venue has not lost its original character. chili crab is excellent, the black pepper one also. The diner experience is worht a visit, located on the hills, the outdoor sitting is a lovely experience, perfect for family and friends.A must do visit, to go back to without hesitation
4
First of all i have to admit i am a little biased as black pepper crab is probably my most favourite dish in Singapore, so most trips for me are excellent. However I have been to long beach many times, at both Dempsey and at the East Coast, and its definitely one of my top choices! Boasted as the 'creators' of the black pepper crab they certainly never disappoint! Its spicy and fresh and always makes for an awesome, fun (and often rather messy) evening dinner. I highly recommend you give it a try and I will certainly continue to keep coming back
4
Long Beach is located at Dempsey Hill which was previously the old British Army Barrack. This place is huge with many restaurants to choose from. I particularly like the Black Pepper Crab and Chilly Crab... This is somewhat an achievement for me as I don't usually take crab... :
5
This branch is quite huge. Being in Singapore means having black pepper crab and I was absolutely satisfied. The crab was fresh and meaty and had just enough pepper sauce on it. It was on the dry side but finger-lickin' good! The prawns and the steamed fish were equally fresh and flavorful. The claypot enoki mushroom and cabbage was clean to the taste. For dessert, we had sweet yam paste with ginko nuts, which for me was a little bit too thick. We washed everything down with refreshing Thai coconut juice. Service was exemplary. Will definitely be back! Tip: There'a a playground where kids could have fun while waiting for the food
4
Having the famous Singapore black pepper crab at thus restaurant is a must. This venue has a vast array of seafood and all of it is very good. Prices are not the cheapest but the quality is worth it.
4
The food and the service is great. The black pepper/chilli crab is delicious. I visit this institution almost every time we visit Singapore.
5
Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly! The 2 of us arrived without a reservation but was given a table for 90 minutes. Fair enough.. Food was amazing and worth the rushed experience :)
4
Celebrated a loved one's birthday last night at this popular seafood restaurant with some close friends. Gotten a private room that allow us to truly enjoy our dinner without any qualm of disturbing others or being disturbed.Wanted to have both the popular black pepper and chilli crab at the same time, the manager was able to make recommendation that allow us to order the set menu with some changes (with minimal additional cost due to my selection of dishes) to suit our taste bud. Both choices of crabs were delicious and the roasted peking duck was good too especially when they prepared the meat in their recommended cooking style.All of us have totally enjoyed the food and the evening of celebration and catching up.Will definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good food, good ambiance and good service.
4
May Linn was our amazing server here. Friendly and welcoming. The food especially the black pepper crab was amazing. We also had the crispy duck which was equally outstanding. The restaurant was busy but we got seated within 5 minutes. Amazing experience and right in the centre of Singapore
5
Excellent 'genuine' seafood from a big chain brand, albeit still easy for tourists to enjoy. Food cooked very well, not just the seafood but the other meat/vegetable dishes as well (which is a good test of the overall quality of the kitchen). The other big chains esp Jumbo are tourist traps with poor food, rude service as they expect most of their guests to not come back. Many locals in contrast come to this branch
4
Our friends told we had to go for Pepper crab when staying in Singapore. Based on Trip Advisor and the hotel we reserved dinner for two at the Long Beach. The food was great! The pepper crab was delicious along with asparagus and fried rice. I wish we had bread to soak up the sauce. The only negative was the service was a bit pushy for us to order more dishes than we could eat. There are better set up for groups of four or more. Still, I would go back.
4
Local expat recommended this place, and it is absolutely worth it! We did not have a reservation, but got a table by ourselves on a separate terrace, and still decent service. We had the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab and plenty of beer. Great taste and great fun. Kids played around us and the night was great. Bring your own napkins!!
3
Family of 5 went to try again, but, it has become more expensive this time round.We had:-1) Chilli Crab And Pepper Crab...The pepper was better Than The Chilli.2) Kai Lan Veggie...Nicely Done.3) Frog Legs - Fried With Chilli And Garlic...Portions Were Small.4) Beef Stew...Beef Was Very Tender.5) Fried Rice.On the whole, it was nice, especially the Beef Stew. The Chilli Crab was a bit of a disappointment. Service was good. Even though we had to request for drinks more than once. It saw a full house the evening we went
4
It was my best place I ate a very good crab in Singapore @ Long Beach 'Dempsey' & among the South East Region!I really enjoyed the place.Very well known / Famous place !!The service is quiet good and followed within time but sets order by order!Anyway I really enjoyed eating my Crab from Sri Lanka 
4
Big crab, if seafood is your thing, then this place is somewhere to visit. The live crabs and fish are really interesting and entertainment for the kids. Very busy, Book in Advance!
4
The Sri Lanka peper crabs are just excellent. The location is nice : the large terrace is quiet. This iconic restaurant is quit expensive. Try it if you can afford it.
3
I was told pepper crab originated here. It wasn't as good as the other place in terms of taste. The crab we had wasn't fresh.
Other dishes were alright but the food in general was overpriced!
3
Went with a few friends and for starters we had the prawn and chicken dishes. The prawn was great, good size and well seasoned. There was nothing special about the chicken. For mains we had pepper crab, chilli crab, spicy steamed fish and a mushroom dish. The pepper crab was outstanding and everything else was good except the chilli crab which was very average and I thought sweet rather than chilli. The bill for 5 of us was just over sd1000 incl a few jugs of beer.
4
A friend who had lived in Singapore suggested this place to us. And what an experience! We had pepper crab, which was divine and baby squid which was amazing! Coming from a country where seafood is plentiful I was skeptical about the outcome but this place really rocks. The restaurant was fully booked as people were still celebrating chinese new year but service was impeccable. Try to get in early to enjoy the scenery as well and avoid the queues.
1
We booked a table for 8.30pm on Saturday and would you believe they ran out of crabs by then?! When we were being seated, they told us "we have run out of Sri Lankan crabs", implying there were other shellfish but when we were ordering, they didn't have anything at all, not even lobster! If we had known there was no shellfish, we would have gone somewhere else
5
I've been a follower of this Long Beach branch since its heydays at Marina South. I will not go to another restaurant for seafood unless I have no choice. Their signature dish is the black pepper and chili crab. Their latest creation of soft and crispy hor fun is great
4
going to Long Beach is one of the must-do things for any visitor to Singapore. there is also another brand but this is convenient since it's in town.the chilli crab and pepper crab are both amazing. something that every visitor has eaten. and must eat. apart form other dishes, these are the 2 that I order every time I go there.if you haven't visited long beach, then I suggest you do so - you will not regret it
4
Been craving for chili crab with mantou so had to come and eat here. As usual place is full packed because it's CNY week and i think also the reason why their crabs this time were smaller. We also ordered the pepper club and the cereal prawn. I would say, my craving was satisfied. Had a cool white wine that went with it
4
A friend took me to this restaurant to have lunch this afternoon while I am visiting Singapore. Good food being served there. Very authentic. I went there in the evening with my wife in the evening in the same day. We has deep fried oyster and lobster. Very well prepared food. If there are four of you, I would suggest ordering a crab dish. A lot of visitors around is ordered this dish but since there were just two of us, we ordered lobster
4
This long established seafood restaurant has this outlet in an old colonial style bungalow opposite the Botanic Gardens. There is live seafood displayed in water tanks. All seafood dishes are nice, particularly the famous Chilli Crab--a must try !
4
A friend introduced me to Long Beach and I recently visited with colleagues. I'd been building it up all day and the food and staff didn't disappoint.We started with the geoduck clam sashimi and soup bowl, followed by mango chili grouper (which would be my last meal on earth), chilli crab & black pepper crab. All were out of this world. Only downside was the noodle dish which was a little gluey. Staff were very attentive and friendly without being pushy.That being said, it was pricey and we'd probably be a bit more reserved on the next visit
4
Disappointed by our visit to Jumbo the very first evening me and my hubby decided to try out probably one of their biggest rivals before we leave. Eventually got the chance today on our final day here and we are so pleased that we did. The staff were very friendly and proactive making suggestions being very flexible so we ended up with a set meal for two with chilli crab instead of black pepper and additional buns for dipping :)) the crab was really good and my hubby's favourite was the noodle which can't remember the name. Dessert came out with really cool presentation and we both stuffed n couldn't finish it all as it was a big meal probably enough for 3! Overall very good dining experience and would highly recommend. However there is always room for improvement...such as offering some bigger napkins to cover the front...also the ladies needs some serious refurbishment!
1
In a country full of great restaurants - this one helps to bring down the standard. I am a single business traveller that's been in Singapore for two weeks and have been impressed every day but at the Long Beach at Dempsey. The only thing worse than the Chilli Crab was the service. No follow up by the waitstaff - the Captain had to take my order. I sat for nearly 20 mins before someone asked if I would like my check - no interest in whether I'd be interested in dessert. A true disappointment.
5
Had a recommendation from a friend from Singapore that when in Singapore we should all go to Long Beach Restaurant at Dempsey. Well we did and as there was 6 of us we all fought it all to get as much of the Black Pepper Crab as we could. yea it was GOOD. Very Peppery but isn't that how it was meant to be. Great Service, cold drinks, good food, and restaurant was packed (which always tells you something) What more could you ask for
4
Nothing to complain about, brilliant service quality Chinese food beautifully prepared and, when you order fish such as Sea Bass you see it whole cooked prior to it being shared out in bowls for each diner. We were six plus a toddler. Beers plus softs plus a bottle of ok wine plus food service and gst 300 dollars. Good I'd say
4
What a difference getting a private room makes! We had a party of 10 this time, and the service in an air conditioned room was exceptional. Food is perfect, as always, prooer crab to die for, and the rest to match. There was a snag with the restaurant running out of bibs, but they came to the rescue with some linen towels that perfectly protected our light shirts from flying cracked crab parts
5
What a spread of sea food. From Jeo duck to alaskan crabs. You take a fixed meal and you are served with a whole spread. Dont miss the black pepper crab, it was out standing. Oh don't forget the mango pudding with the dry ice smoke. What an effect. Over all an excellent. Good meal not to forget.
3
Can't go wrong with chili prawns, pepper crab, steamed garoupa and a great outdoor table and beer on a Saturday night. Love the fact that they peel and shell the fish for you so you don't even have to get messy as before. Only thing, can they ask servers who are obviously sick to stay home, instead of hacking their germs into my food as they prep it? Is that too much to ask in a civilized Sngapore
4
I enjoyed dinner with nine Chinese colleagues at an outdoor table. The staff did a good job accomodating a few last-minute friends joining us. The food was served family style and we had a great time. We had one of the multi-course prix fixe menus, along with a few additions. Black pepper and white pepper crab, fish, noodles, rice and veggies - all presented well and very flavorable. Enjoyed coconut juice served in the coconut
4
The crab was extremely fresh, cooked to perfection with tasty sauce.
Tip: Be sure to ask for the weight of the crab before you order, as the price is market price set for that day. Otherwise it could become expensive.
4
Chili crab was great! One tip would be to go all out and use your hands! Ask for a bib as it can get messy. Also had the beef with chili which was very good too.

It is about 10 years since we left Singapore and moved to Europe, and we have missed the chilli crab and black pepper crab at Long Beach, their Dempsey location being new to us.We had a chance to revisit it tonight and it was wonderful.Peppery, tangy, buttery and spicy, rich flavours that cover your taste buds, hands and chin, with rice buns to soak up the sauce on the chilli crab, balanced with various Chinese greens and all washed down with a jug of Tiger beer ... Bliss !I specially brought a shirt of many colours to handle the inevitable splashes, but the staff kindly provided us with large bibs.Service was attentive and helpful, and the area which was the old army barracks when we lived here, has been transformed into a host of different restaurants and food types for all tastes and budgets.It was even better than we remembered

OMG, the chili crab and pepper crab here were absolutely amazing. Fantastic. I could have eaten every meal at this restaurant. My h travels on business to Singapore - and his Chinese speaking work colleagues took us here for dinner. Dempsey is a great little area full of busy restaurants, fun to walk around. There was quite a line at the restaurant - luckily for us, the colleagues got there well ahead of us. And ordered. I don't know what they put in their chili crab but it was addictive. Totally addictive. I wish I could make that at home. Black pepper crab was also great. We had the spare ribs which were very flavorful and had a beautiful texture. One of our hosts ordered a whole coconut as a drink - which seemed unusual but was actually pretty tasty. Just be careful to get the right utensil to dig out the coconut - or you might end up wearing the coconut milk

Every few years we visit Singapore and this place is always on our list. It never fails to deliver the best Sri Lankan Popular Chilli Crab dish with bread--over 1kg for S$68. You don't need anything else---well maybe a Tiger Beer or two!!!!!! Sit inside in the air-conditioning

My husband travels to singapore frequently, so when I got the opportunity to join him he said we had to come to Long Beach Seafood on Dempsey Road for the black pepper crab. I really loved the area around the restaurant and the food was really amazing. The seafood is so fresh it's swimming in tanks before you order it. Was quite busy on a Thursday night, and reservations are highly recommended, although we found that the locals were given priority over everyone else regardless of reservation or not. When we were sat it was at a very odd table in the corner by the front door, and we waited over 45 min for someone to come over to take our food order. We flagged down the hostess, who was very apologetic, and she got someone to come over and take our order right away. Despite this, I think the locale and the food were well worth the wait

Was there with my colleagues from all over the world (26 of us) last night. Service and food was good, but a bit pricey especially the drinks and beers. The seafood was freshRecommended dishes and my favourite were:-1. The steamed live prawn2. The steamed live spring water golden phoenix Fish in Sintang style3. Famous Black Pepper crab - crab was fresh, but i didnt like the strong pepper taste4. Fried you-tiao with fresh crab meat and minced live prawn5. Supreme roast chicke

Good:-Staff are professional & helpful!-Staff do not upsell.-Outdoor seating is good, despite the heat.-The annex has ample sitting space.Bad:-Main entrance has limited aircon tables.-Not possible to accept last minute reservations, due to high traffic.-10% rebates given if you are a member

As a huge seafood lover I was dying to try the famous crab on offer at Long Beach. I was not completely disappointed but not overly enthralled either. Inviting some friends visiting from Sydney to dine with us we reserved a table outside. On arrival we were greeted by a cacophony of noise from the incredibly crowded dining room and were relieved to escape to the relative calm of the outdoor seating. Once we were able to locate a waitress we ordered a staggering amount of dishes (we were all super starving). Crab, lobster, prawns and other sea dwelling delights were ordered in abundance. It was probably a good thing we did order so much as from that point on all the serving staff seemed to disappear. We would have had a tough time requesting any more dishes. Anyway, on to the important bit...the food. Some dishes were borderline delicious others a little more mediocre. Stand outs included the famous black chilli crab and wasabi prawn. To be perfectly honest though I have had much better.All in all Long Beach at Dempsey definitely has an air of mass production and tourism about it and the service leaves a lot to be desired! I would eat there again but I believe this restaurant may have had it's hey day
5
This was a recommendation from someone who eats here regularly. Thank you so much. Get a cab and visit when in Singapore or if like us you are on a stopover between flights. Chilli Crab and Black pepper crab to die for. The wine list is not bad and if you are staying in a Singapore hotel will seem like a bargain. Will stopover again

Very typical restaurant well located in Dempsey Hill. Very convenient place as you can find a lot of bars in the same quarter to go after dinner. The pepper crab is just perfect and you have a lot of choice of dishes. The service is very typical too and it's sometimes difficult to be understood if you don't speak Chinese.
3
We couldn't reserve a table with the competitor as they were full (on a Monday night) however this restaurant was recomemded to us and they weren't full, maybe 50% full. The pepper crab, spinach and tri egg dish, seafood noodle were all very tasty and the price was reasonable. However the service was pushy when taking our order and then at times slow when we needed more tea and napkins for the messy (but delicious) crab. I felt more like we were in a process to be fed rather than out for casual / relaxed meal with friends. I would return as the food was good but I'd be firmer with the staff to ensure we weren't "proccesed" but rather served and indulged.
5
It may not be possible to get to eastcoast all the time. Dempsey is turning into an upmarket wine and dine area. Long beach keeps it's menu at affordable prices similiar to it's eastcoast branch. The food is excellent. Outdoor seating is nice but there isn't really a view. The restaurant is very popular with tourists, business visitors and locals. Reservations are highly recommended. For those of you who enjoy Durian, there is a Durian stall near the open car park near the entrance of Dempsey road.
2
Don't fall for this one - despite the concierge's best efforts to convince me that locals still come here, my insticts told me otherwise. Should've gone with the gut as the food was mediocre and service even worse. Have a feeling that chili crab can be had at a better value and quality elsewhere. Anywhere but Long Beach @ Dempsey!
3
Comveniently located at dempsey so you don't have to go all the way to east coast to eat the same thing. Crowded on a thursday evening, so business is bustlingWe ordered a set menu as there were 20 of us. Started with bamboo clams with a good amount of garlic. Then there was fried fish with sweet sour gravy, average stuff. The crispy skin chicken is usually popular. Then the main event, pepper crabs, which were good. The carbs was spicy malay noodles mee goreng, which was tastyOverall it was ok, as it's so mass produced these days as it's tough to rate such a joint as exceptiona
5
The restaurant was very busy but the staff were helpful and efficient. We didn't have a clue what to order having recently arrived in Singapore but the waiter (Jeff) helped us and we a lovely meal and memorable evening out - we have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant
4
Good restautrant and great variety of Seafood including Fish through to Alaskian King Crab..Reasonable price as wellFound sitting inside a little noisey so would suggest you sit outside if you want volume at a normal level.If you want the Private rooms make sure you boook in advance as we missed ou
4
Plenty of other food to choose if Crabs not your thing, but they do have one of the best in Singapore. They also will crack the crabs and get the meat out to save you the hassle. But the taste of either Black Pepper or Chili is a Singapore must try. I've tried it in other countries and it is still better in Singapore.Fried rice was a bit on the greasy side. But the fried green beans are fabulous! Reservations are needed for dinner any night of the week, lunch is easier to go in without a reservation
4
It was an adhoc decision to try out the chilli crab at Long Beach. There were no tables available when we reached there and we had to wait for about 25mins or so for our table, we were a bit agitated at first due to the long wait. However the moment we were seated, the service was excellent, we were approached by this lady call May Lim to order and she's so considerate to ensure we don't over order since there were only 4 of us. We ordered the famous chilli Sri Lankan crab, deep fried squid, stir fry baby kailan and a simple fried rice. The chlli crab was excellent! It's my first time tasting Singaporean chilli crab and it's really really delicious and the crab meat was solid, perfect dish to go with the fried mantou. Even the deep fried squid was really good too. The supervisor May Lim will check with us whether the food is good and ensure everything is ok, very good service indeed. Will definitely recommend people to try out this place

If you want to have a good selection of seafood with a decent quality in Singapore, choose this restaurant. We really enjoyed it for the second time now, especially the crabs (chilly and black pepper) . It's nice to sit outside, do not have to suffer from air condition. Service is good, prices I guess average for restaurants in Singapore, but the food is really worth it
1
Air conditioned restaurant filled with smoking incense. Huge turn off. Food was not cheap, but standard was somewhat above average. Nothing to shout about though.
5
This is a must visit while you are in Singapore - the Pepper Crab and Chili Crab are simply the best here. Service is a whirlwind but efficient. This place just does it right. Feel free to put on the cheesy apron and dig in!
3
Went to this highly rated establishment, and as the crabs were tasty, we couldn't get service once our dishes were delivered. We asked for extra napkins as the dishes are quite messy, and she acknowledged with a nod but that was the last we saw of her. They neglect to tell tourists that EVERYTHING is EXTRA as we found out when the bill arrived. The dish of peanuts they bring when you sit down, the wet napkins they give you, and the bread with the crab dishes are all unexpected charges! Then we find out that there is a sink with paper towels in the middle of the restaurant outside that regulars are obviously aware of, but no, we ask for extra napkins and get charged! If I'm paying that much for the crabs, I at least expect better service.
3
We thought we would try Long Beach as we had been in Jumbo the week before and wanted to try a different seafood restaurant. But we were disappointed in the food. The seafood hor fun that we ordered arrived in a lump and look very unappetising and didn't taste any better. The sharksfin soup was missing the sharksfin! Most of the food that we ordered was of a poor quality and the service was also rather poor. If you are thinking of having seafood in the Dempsey area I would suggest that you go to Jumbo and give Long Beach a miss as they are more expensive and the food quality is poor
2
It was a family dinner for 8 adults and 3 children celebrating father-in-law's birthday.Chose this place as it was well-known for their seafood. We had a room but it was poorly maintained and rather cramped.Cutlery was not thoroughly cleaned with stains on almost all the pieces we were given. Terrible ...We ordered a set which costs more than a $1K but the fish was undercooked and had to be returned for 'additional rework'.Other dishes were ok but certainly not fantastic for the price paid. The overall experience is mediocre in terms of service. Certainly not somewhere we will patronize again.
4
Went there just before the New Year as we had visitors from Oregon. We have been to Long Beach Dempsey at least 5-6 times in 2012 and the food has never disappointed. We also like the more laid-back feel of the entire Dempsey area, an area we frequent constantly.Black-Pepper Crab : Finger Licking GoodBamboo Clams in Garlic : AwesomeSteam Prawns : Very fresh, hence the lack of need for any condimentsCuttlefish Dough Fritters : A little greasy, but was goodFried Noodles : Good flavorFresh Mangoes for Dessert : Wolfed down in a blink of an eyeNo visit to Singapore is complete without a Singapore Seafood Meal, and Long Beach is the place we will always take our guests to
5
If Moliere is correctly quoted by Samy, the South Indian eatery nest door ( see reviews) he probably was thinking of the Black Pepper Crab at Long Beach. They claim to have invented the dish, but if that is a stretch they certainly did perfect it. This is one of Singapore's iconic dishes, deservedly so. I come here for crab and only Black PepperbCrab. No starters, no side dishes, just delectable crab washed down with a jug or two of Tiger.Come here, or to the original location at East Coast Parkway. You'll be thankful you did
4
I usually went to other seafood restaurant in East Coast or No Sign Board in Singapore.Latest trip to Singapore about 10 days ago, had a group dinner with colleagues at Singapore office after company business meeting. Haven't heard of this previously, but it was worthwhile visit if you are a big fan for famous Singaporean black pepper crab or curry crab.I have to say it was a finger licking great meal that I would surely visit again :-

 My husband and I love to eat out regularly and we know when the food is superb, good or simply bad. Upon our arrival, with reservations, we were given a huge table for six and seated next to the glass wall which we could physically see our neighbors eating and vice versa. The lady who took care of our table did not know english so it was quite frustrating to get around with the different items on the menu. We finally settled for simpler items, prawns and fish. The prawns came in first very nicely presented and large but the taste was terrible. It seemed it was boiled in sea water and rather raw. The sauce that accompanied it was not too bad to relieve the after taste of the sea water. When the fish came in, we had requested a fried red snapper, it looked like a small fried coy!! This was even worse. My husband just had a few bites of this and had to leave it as it was full of tiny bones. To drink, my husband had a coke and I had a glass of wine. You can't go wrong here but to pay the price for a bad glass of wine surely hurts. The cost in wine was 19.00 for a glass!! The cost of the overall dinner was $128.65!! A big ripoff for what we got. We are used to pay on occasions $400 for two with no regrets if the food was exceptionally good. So the price for dinner is not an issue for us. There are no napkins on the tables to be seem. They only give you wipes and no utensils. You basically eat with your hands if you do not know how to eat with chop sticks and if you run out of wipes and ask for more, you are charged for it!! For sure we will not return. The prices for the food and ambience is not worth it. The only good thing to remember was that they were able to call a taxi for us and this came very fast. We did not have to wait to leave!! Thank God and good riddence.

We had an absolutely fantastic meal at Long Beach. From the soup - crab sweet corn - to the honey chilli chicken and everything else we ate - it was just fantastic Special mention to the pepper crabs and the oysters. Oh my god ! The next time I am in Singapore, I know where my first meal will be !
5
It is the large deck that largely makes this Seafood eatery better than its nemesis inside. The seafood is equally good, and the seating choices are more varied. Try the salted fish fried rice.
4
Crab was Outstanding, as were the noodles and vegetables. Paired with some Tiger, it was a perfect meal.
4
A jug of tiger beer? A few crabs? And a nice relaxed balcony. What more can you ask for?We ordered 2 crabs, a black pepper and a chilli. Both were amazing, the vote was split but best vote went to the black pepper. We almost ordered the Alaskan king crab (deadliest catch style) but at $600 we decided otherwise. also had some bok choy, prawns and some donut bread things that went very well with the chilli crab sauce. No one was hungry afterward, always a good sign for a crab house. A must do for seafood eaters when visiting Singapore.
4
Can't really comment on any other dishes than the grab in black or white pepper sauce or with chilli but that has been my reason to re-visit the place for many times.Imported grab is quite expensive but since the visits have only been on special occasions, it has been worth the money.The service is propably not the most efficient and despite always reserving in before hand the reservations have been lost or not in particular section of the restaurant (on patio) but usually the confusion has been solved and the over all experience has been good
4
This place is an Esau one to access without suffering the heavy traffic jams towards the East Coast, and food is as good. And food can be very spicy too, for those who love chilli crab and pepper crab and the likes, this place does meet expectations. The area at Dempsey hill makes it a pleasant venue to have dinner and move afterwards to another place for a drink and perhaps a bit of live music.The sits outside on the balcony are pleasant, no air con however served by fans. It is perhaps a better location than inside, as you feel the age of the place much more

We went to Dempsey Hill to try the seafood at Long Beach. First, we didn't make any reservation so we had to wait a while; also, without the reservation, I guess, we didn't get to have the good tables. They placed us in the lower 'deck', where lighting was poor. Furthermore, behind our table were what looked to be storage for dirty plates... it marred the already dark ambiance. We ordered the popular dishes - black pepper crabs, buttered prawns, fried kangkong with cuttlefish. While we waited for the food, they handed out a small of peanuts which was not bad at all. When the food came, they looked lovely (sadly, twas just dark for me). The black pepper crabs were huge, but I have tasted better versions. The buttered prawns tasted really fresh. The kangkong with cuttlefish was very spicy; I would suggest you avoid this unless you are really used to 'hot' and spicy dishes. The staff were attentive. All in all, I had hoped they kept their standards by maintaining the same bright environment all through the eating areas. It would have made a lot of difference in our dining experience.As tourists, we came to Dempsey Hill via the taxi; after dinner, we found out twas quite hard to get a ride back to the hotel, so we walked down the road to where Dempsey road exits. There we saw a small stand near a wide parking space. here was a man whose only trade was to serve durian fruit. As we were curious, we sat down one of the stools and ordered for a sweet durian fruit (you can choose sweet, bitter sweet and bitter)... it tasted really good! it didn't have a strong smell (the taxi driver told us, the riper, the less odor), and the man offered disposable hand gloves! I would suggest you end your seafood dinner with this fresh sweet treat

When we visit Long beach@ Dempsey i was a little bit disappointed because i am expecting that the food was really excellent. since it was my friend who recommend me to come to this place. so from bukit timah we drove here to Dempsey. they're popular of Black pepper crab, but that night i just want to have a prawns,chicken and the noodles.. the food presentation was ok, the staff is a little bit snobbish but its ok because it was busy at that time. so here it goes when we are about to eat the food i was shock and confused about the food that we order. Do we order food or MSG? all the food is full of MSG. we couldn't even finished our food.i need to drink a lot of water to clear my whole mouth and throat. but still the after taste of the MSG is still there. it lingers into my system. I think i should listen to my friend that i should try the Crab only
4
I had the best crab this trip, I can't get enough of the chili crab with mantou that you dip in the gravy, the cereal prawn is the best! With white wine, our meal is the best. It is so much better that they renovated and we were given a table outside.. Nice ambiance.
5
Do you want to try to eat a huge crub? well this is the right place!1kg crab for few euros. We went there in 7 people. we ordered 5 king crab, 2 portions of prawns, 3 portions of oysters, wine, beers, dessert. In total we spent around 60â‚¬ each. Not cheap, but if we would have eat the same in europe the price would have been at least the double
5
Hosted a party of eight to a wonderful seafood dinner. The chili and black pepper crabs were plump and sweet. The frog legs perfectly spiced with a touch of garlic and the sea bass steamed in Thai seasoning melted in your mouth. Staff very attentative with ice cold mugs for the Tiger beer. Outstandin
4
Sat out side on a balmy evening. Very attentive staff who managed our large group well. Good chilli crab and a variety of spicy chicken dishes and accompaniments. Mid range for prices for food and alcoholic drinks. An enjoyable evening.
5
The whole package is simply excellent. The food, service and location are reason why its for me the best crab restaurant in Singapore. There might be better place for the food somewhere at a street place, but the location and the staff cannot be beaten. Very recommendable
4
Dempsey is a fun location to visit for a drink and Longbeach the perfect place for dinner with family or friends. Promises a fun night out! Drinking beer, eating chilli crab... A wonderful summer night. The recommended special prawns were tasty, the vegetables pleasing and the chilli crab a standout. Great dining experience
4
This is a seafood restaurant about 10 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road. It specialises in mudcrab, with chili or black pepper. Make a booking and get there before 6.00pm as it is very popular with the locals. It is not a food hall place so please dress respectably. It standards and quality are way above places like Newton Circus which is living off its tired old reputation for seafood. Dont waste your time going there.It has a mainly outdoors setting and you would think you were in a national park as it is so quiet.The seafood was delectable and we concentrated on the chili and black pepper mudcrab dishes.You wont be disappointed
4
Menu includes lobster, Live Tiger Sea Mantis with Spicy Salt and Pepper, Live Drunken Prawns with Brandy & Herbal Soup, BBQ Live Nilotica Red Fish, Renowned Crispy Duck, Claypot Live Marble Goby and best of all is the crab dish which is served in many varieties including the popular chilli crab
5
We headed over to Dempsey Hill for some famous Singaporean Crab. Dempsey Hill is basically a village of sorts filled with restaurants, a few bars, and some shops catering to expats. We heard that the Long Beach Restaurant served up “the original and the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore”. How could we go wrong? We ordered that along with a couple side dishes. Their Black Pepper Crab was phenomenal!! So spicy, so messy, and perfectly proportioned! I highly recommend this place. http://www.internationalnabers.com/2012/05/25/great-beers-found-in-singapore

This was my favourite restaurant when I worked in Singapore a few years ago. At that time it was in Marina Bay, now it has moved to Dempsey Road. It didn't disappoint. The friendly staff, excellent service and brilliant food were all in evidence as they had been previously
1
It was last Saturday night at around 11pm , we were a group 12 people. We ordered sizzling beancurd which was prepared differently from the usual style. The cereal prawns were stale. The steam fish was served overwhelmingly with garlic.We also ordered pepper crab, keow teow and 2 other dishes. For desserts we ordered pudding which tasted very ordinary. Overall, it was a bad experience and will not return to Long Beach which was our favorite seafood restaurant earlier. The quality and standard dropped drastically. Very disappointing...
4
The bet is on. Longbeach or Jumbo serves the best pepper crabs? Either way, customers WIN. Long Beach has a more laxed feel when you eat as its dining areas are in the main aircon restaurant, on the verandah (outdoor but with a roof) or just below the verandah (outdoor in brollies). Going to dinner give your guests a feel of working up an appetite as they climb up the little hill of about 30 steps. Thanks

We had been told to have Chilli Crab when in Singapore. Long Beach @ Dempsy was quite close to our hotel and reception recommended it as being good sea food. We were not disappointed. It is a very busy atmospheric restaurant and we thankfully booked before we went. They did say they only had garden tables left but when we arrived we were offered a table indoors which we decided to take. The service was excellent and the waitress very kindly helped us with the menu, which we found rather confusing. She gave suggestions and made sure that we didn't over order, which is so easy when you are not sure of portion sizes. All the sea food is completely fresh coming out of tanks. We had the house speciality prawns, suger pea shoots in garlic followed by the Chilli Crab and fried buns, a kind of sweet bread. We drank bear because the wine was too expensive
4
Nice informal setting in which to kick back. Good food, efficient but not terribly friendly service. Chili crab the star!
5
If your in the mood for seefod and want to try Chilli Crab (or Black Pepper Crab) this would be the place I'd recommend.
5
Caters well to non-seafood eaters, vegetarians , worth a visit.
5
Best black pepper crab in Singapore. Lovely sitting in the garden. We go back time and time again.
4
Good location, pretty good prices. They also do the crabs for you if you want.

We came for a professional dinner. The Chinese maid had inaudible English. She gave advices on our menu, changing it five times without we requested it. At the end, for 6 persons, the bill amount was 1100 SGP dollars. They charged napkins, deserts separately from menu and so on... INSAN
1
We were group of 7-8 colleagues, who dine at this restaurant last night 21st Feb. We had the most "horrific" time when the bill was presented. The Manager who took the order had the tendency of making the customer to pay a fortunate for a food that is so common in singapore. we were recommended a set menu for 6-7, with about 10 dish (that no one on this planet) could finish or eat, and we ended up with a big bill and waste of lots of food. perhaps this restaurants does not appreciate the wastage of food, but one should never recommend to "customers" who are not singaporean or local a list of food that is so costly. we had to pay SGD1111 for 6 people! They even charged us for wet towels, and SGD6 for diet coke! What a rip off. Take my pick, i have lived in singapore for 3 years and this is the first time i have had a bad time in a seafood restaurant. And this will be the FIRST and the LAST time we will go there. The Manager of the restaurant was not helpful, he did not even explain how we ended up with such a big bill. The FOOD was normal and i am 100% sure i could have got better in another place for a less amount of money we had to pay. Take our advise, never go to this place, you will have a big hole in your pocket and a shock to your system

We lived in Singapore 35 years ago and Singapore Chilli Crab was an all-time favourite that has now traveled the globe. In recent years the dish has become overshadowed by the salt and pepper crab and other varieties but if you want to try the traditional masterpiece--this is the place to come. Ask for the Sri Lankan crab --about $58 Sing--and a serve of the steamed bread---that's all you'll need with a Tiger Beer--heaven!!!!!! The Dempsey Road location is 5 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road, so you don't have to venture out to the East Coast
1
I went there for my family to taste their chilli and pepper crabs. When we arrived at 8.30pm on a Saturday night, we were told that the only available crab was teh Alaskan one, which is 400 SG$/kilo!!! What a joke. They told us the Sri Lanka cran would arrive during teh night, so we insisted to stay. After a million back and forth discussions with the staff, we finally were made aware that the crab would be delivered and we could have it. In the mean time, other people had to order the super expensive crab. The quality of the service was very poor. They made many mistakes in the order and the ladies giving away napkins and changing plates could not care less!!! I was very disappointed as I went there many times with an excellent experience. This time it was terrible!! Would not go there anymor

Long Beach @ Dempsey located at quiet place but when you enter inside it is quite crowded. Menu offers excellent seafood Singaporean delicacies. The one we tested was Singaporean crab curry alongwith Tiger beer. You can sit outside or book an independent room for small group. The service is very prompt and friendly. Overall wonderful dining experience in Singapore
4
First time visiting this restuarant and we tried a variety of differnt Chinese dishes which were good, but the black pepper crab was outstanding and highly recommended. Will definately come back again.
4
Having been away for more than 8 years, I am glad to see that the food here is still very good. Portions are large and the service staff are wonderful about advising you on how much to order (or in my case, not order). Restaurant is in a good location with indoor and outdoor seating. They do accept reservations, which is necessary, especially on Friday evenings and the weekends. Service is good and it is obvious the servers have been well trained to wait patiently on customers. However when the restaurant gets crowded, then service tends to be spread a bit thin

We just got back from having a great evening. We were two couples dining. My husband had been here before with business associates. We had the drunken prawns, black pepper crab (2) and order of fried rice with prawn, a bottle of wine and 2 beers and it was $122 Singapore dollars per couple. The staff was extremely nice and we learned that the rice or noodle is always brought at the end of the meal. The crab is very messy to eat and we knew this so we brought a hand towel from our hotel for each person. They don't give you napkins like we are used to, but they brought us plenty of wet naps and finger bowls. If you request they will do the "live" drunken prawns at your table. There are lots of fish tanks in the restaurant. The flavor of the black pepper crab was delicious. It had a smoked bbq flavor to it. And we all got plenty messy. But, that added to the flavor of the evening!This was a meal not for prissies!! We all had dark "gunk" under our fingernails. I would return as it was just a really great dining experience. Fun was had by one and all
4
Dempsey is a great dining spot in Singapore and there are quite a number of restaurants here. We came here for a seafood lunch and our choice is Long Beach @ Dempsey.My favourite food here is the Black Pepper Crab, Claypot Rice Noodles with Crab and Lobster with cereal.Its a great dining place, lots of greenery and trees in Dempsey. Feel a world apart from the concrete jungle of Singapore !
3
The restaurant was up a hill, not easy to find, even for a local taxicab driver. I had chili crab which was quite tasty but nothing extraordinary to justify the expensive cost. The service was brisk but unfriendly. If you get there by taxi, you might have to ask the restaurant people to call for the taxi and prepare to wait
4
The Crab here is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted on the IslandAmbience is ok - view of Holland road in the backgroundYou have to be careful as they try and sell you too big a portion of crab.. and it is fairly pricey.. but it tastes so good...Service from the waitresses is bizarre - they just dont seem to care too much and couldnt care less that your there really - quite snotty and we dont really care attitude.. but that was my and my friends impressions but it didnt really spoil the food (reminded me of China town in Sydney!)Tables/quality is very average - just a notch up from Hawkerish.. not classyBut despite all this the food was great and that is what we went for.. so I'm giving this place 4/5 and it would get 10/10 on Food
3
The location on Dempsey Hill is a nice one, surrounded by greenery and opposite the Botanical Gardens. The place is huge and usually crowded, so do not expect a quiet dinner time. We had one of the private rooms and privacy is restricted to the visual partition of the rooms. We had 3 noisy groups surrounding us and the noise level was the same as if they had just partied in our room. The food is OK lah, the best dish served being the deep fried snapper with mango chilli sauce. The rest of the dishes was just good but nothing special. One last advise, stay with beer for your dinner, the wine list reads nice, the wine is neither stored properly, nor being served at the right temperature nor does the staff know what wine is
3
We are very glad to have come here, highly recommended by a local. Had the wonderful Chili Crab, with amazing vegetables and crab rice. Delicious!However, the service was so bad, that it nearly ruined our experience. What's up with no napkins???? Everyone gets a wet wipe, and that's it, you are on your own. The problem is that you eat everything with your hands, and all foods are sauce based, so you do the math.I looked over at other tables in the crowded restaurant, and everyone was licking their fingers trying to cope with the absence of the civilized napkin.

Really, really enjoyed the food! All was fresh and excellent and we had quite a variety of dishes. Mostly seafood. Drink service was attentive. Food delivered to table as it became ready, a little dis-orienting for people used to typical US service (appetizers then entree). This was the best tasting, best quality food I had while I was in Singapore

I really do not understand the other reviews complaining on the service, because I was more or less drowning in their very polite service. Almost as much as it stressed me a bit.. I had chilli crab, which was good, but perhaps not as exciting as I had expected. The best part of the meal was the baby cabbage steamed in lots of garlic. I am not convinced that I will go back here, cause I have tasted better food a lot cheaper in this city

Good food, esp. black pepper crab. However more than once I've booked tables only to find no booking when I arrive. Distracted service.

Not THE best chilli crab I've ever had, but still quite good....

No big deal. But nice 'ambience' with the usual tanks in the background

I was keen to try some Chili Crab in Singapore and was recommended to try here. Wrong choice. The staff weren't that interested in whether I was there or not. Apart from plonking some peanuts and napkin on the table (which was later charged to me) no one took my order for food or drink for 20 minutes, and the crab took another half hour to arrive. I don't know what Chili Crab is supposed to be, but the 'hero' of the dish ie the crab was lost in a mass of chili sauce. Picking your way through the crab to get some tasty morsels was messy ( I needed another 4 napkins to keep cleaning my hands) and the crab's flavour was bland. The chili sauce was too sweet, and not enough heat to even raise some sweat on the brow. I had to go back into town and grab an icecream sandwich to console myself

Probably one of THE places to go in Singapore for Seafood. It has the feeling its been established quite a while, more Raffles than Clarke Quay. Enormous, yes, faded yes, authentic, yes, crowded yes (reserve!), expensive (can be). Crabs are the the speciality and flown in fresh from around the world so not exactly ecologically sound.Ten minutes by taxi from Orchard outside the rush

This was my second visit to Long Beach (last one being in August 2010) and I was not disappointed. I came for the Chili Crab & the Black Pepper Crab and I've decided I like the Black Pepper Crab better. The crabmeat was so sweet and not over powered by the seasoning

I was in Singapore hosting some customers and was recommended this place as a good place to take them. That was a great recommendation. This place is great!Since we had a group of 10 people I booked a table and ordered a set menu in advance (lucky we did too, as people were queuing to get in). Our menu included Bamboo Clams, Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roasted Chicken, Fish (not sure what type), Tofu, Noodles, Fruit (and perhaps something else) and it worked out at about S$80 a head (including quite a few beers - buy the big tiger draughts). I think that was a bargain. The food was great, especially the black pepper crab. The atmosphere is really nice, and eating there in a group is actually a lot of fun with the rotating table. My one criticism was that service got slower as the night went on. But to be honest we were having a nice time so it wasn't a big problem. I thoroughly recommend this place, and next time I am in Singapore I will check out one of the other branches of Long Beach

Before I start, I am asian and have eaten all over so my standards for what I expect aren't that high! I went to a long beach restaurant, waited 10 minutes to be seated and then 10 mins after ordering was told they were out of crab and I'd have to wait 1 hour before they could get some!I told them I'd wait but to bring out the rest of the dishes I'd ordered, after all I'd come all the way to try the black pepper and chilli crab. Another 10 minutes later, I was told I might have to wait 2 hours so I decided to pack up and leave. The staff were courteous, picked the bill off my table and crossed my orders out.They told me to head to the east coast store, so off I went in a taxi. On arrival, I found that they had called in advance to tell them to charge me for the drinks (all $6 worth!) from the last place!Service was slow, and not courteous for the rest of the meal.Overall, the food is pretty good, the black pepper crab is special but the chilli crab is no better than any other place on the east coast.I would highly recommend NOT ever going to this place
