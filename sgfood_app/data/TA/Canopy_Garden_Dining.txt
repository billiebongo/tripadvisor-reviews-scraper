We are a big group of adults and kids and dogs. We sat outdoors and the fans were great at cooling us down. Waiter got some of our orders wrong, but we are a big group. Food was decent. We'll definitely be back!
4
relaxed dog friendly venue serving good food at acceptable prices. perfect weekend brunch location for everyone
5
Comfortable environment and attentive staffs, perfect for weekend brunch if you prefer somewhere tranquil and quiet with beautiful scenery.
5
Lovely environment in the midst of Bishan park. Easily accessible from the car park too. Food is nice.
4
Sunday afternoon revising at #CanopyGardenDining. The outdoor area has very nice ambience surrounded by lush greenery in the middle of BishanPark
3
Perhaps it was a different dish we tried from the menu. The pan-seared salmon on mash in a vegetable broth was tasty comfort food. The ala-carte coffee was good. Service was more friendly and prompt than our weekday experience. Great brunch place.
4
We just booked at the last minute and we were still accommodated well. The ambiance was perfect after a rain in the evening. Best of all, the food was superbly delicious. I would recommend it.
3
We went here for a family brunch, and ordered 2 big breakfast and 1 butter croissants with chicken & egg. The food were quite good but not too special, the croissants with chicken was little bit too plain to my liking. The fresh orange juices were sour, so not too nice to drink - and the persons at the cashier said nothing when I told them about the quality of their fresh orange juices. Ambience is quite nice, but price is too high for the quality of foods and services provided.
4
Had lunch with a number of business associates. Not too crowded being a weekday and mostly couples and families. Set lunch was good value. Had the fish which was good. A little out of the way though. Not really accessible without a car. Imagine it would be nicer in the evenings
3
We had breakfast there with young children. The service was average as they did their task...not the fastest service but they do their job. Food was a bit disappointing though..Pancake was just one big pancake with one scoop of ice cream and the classic egg benedict was rather bland for 2 of us in the group. Their stir fry mushrooms were also a little bland. However the place is nice as it is situated in a garden setjting and many famies opted to sit outdoors to enjoy the good weather
3
The restaurant has a nice ambience - it is located in the park. The dishes was ok but prices steep. Portions are small.
4
This time I would like to recommend the waffle with ice cream. The waffle is light, crunchy on the outside but moist in the inside. Definitely the perfect way to laze around with your furry kid by your side.
3
Wanted to try out the food places in Bishan Park and this cafe was available on Chope. Food was average cafe-fare, I liked the bright and comfortable setting which was not too noisy, this is a nicefamily friendly place to chill during the weekends.
4
Awesome and good and wonderful to be hanging at my regular hangout! Wish for better promo on booze...
4
The location of the restaurant is in a park so it has a great scenery to have brunch at. however food are so so only.
5
Service is good and food served was fast.
Ambience is relaxing though with kids/infant around can be rather noisy.
4
The menu was improved and there were more selection varieties. The fries were yummy as usual and its pet friendly policy was commendable.
3
had a dinner with a good friend on friday night. my friend was late and it was raining outside. no water was served until my friend arrived. staff was basically cold and unfriendly. ordered the wagyu beef burger, patty was dry, doesn't taste like wagyu really. the only saving grace was the truffle fries. brownie and vanilla ice-cream was pretty good, gotta give them that. could really be good with better service
3
My girlfriends and I visited Canopy a couple of days back to celebrate our annnual gathering and one of the girlâ€™s belated birthday. Canopy was a convenient place for all of us since we stay in the North area. The food was satisfactory, perhaps I thought I would have expected more given that the ambience seemed to exude a certain sense of class. However, my bolegnese pasta was rather salty and left me feeling very thirsty. Service was pretty decent, although they seemed very keen on clearing the table as soon as possible. It almost felt very rushed. Overall, being in a somewhat quiet place which was convenient for my girlfriends and I, it was a pleasant experience, but perhaps could provide better experience for customer.
4
First try at Canopy. Nice to walk through the park first. Both my friend and I took pasta. Was good, both pastas were nice but not amazing.Service was acceptable but could be better. Sometimes check at the table whether anything extra is needed would be nice. Refill the ice water without having to ask would be nice too.The lemonade tastes great btw. Not too sweet.
4
Overall experience was good. Free kids meal with every main course ordered. Nice place for gathering. Air conditioning was not working very well during date of visit.
3
Food was good... but generally pricey. The burger was $19..... not too hard to find. It's just in Bishan Park
4
Place is nice and pet friendly but doesn’t serve for for pets which will not be my first choice for bringing pets back. But a great place to mingle with friends.
4
staff were very welcoming and me & wife had a wonderful brunch. lady incharge also gave a nice surprise when she gave my wife a slice of cake with a candle for her birthday. well done.
4
A nice and cool chilling environment, great to hang out with friends over wine and some food in the evening.
4
Food is generally nice but my order of lamb rib wet rice has the gamey taste. Went on a Sunday thus would be slightly more crowded with kids and pets but overall the ambience is wonderful.
5
Must try the carbonara. It’s the best I’ve ever tasted! The mushroom soup is alright. Not very soupy as I wish it would be.
4
Not the first time visiting canopy however I think there’s not much difference or changes of the food over the year. Coffee was good.
4
Love the ambience among the lush greenery! The staff were attentive, constantly replenishing water and allowed us to enjoy our afternoon break at our own pace. Exactly what we needed - a breather from bustling city life! For that, it deserves a 4-Star because the food is really not worth a mention.
3
Gone there for brunch @11am. Waited quite awhile to have our orders taken. While we were eating, one of the staff was clearing a table beside us & sprayed cleaning detergents directly onto the table but towards our direction. He should know that this will cause vapours to be dispersed onto our food!
4
Still the airy nice environment filled with attentive staff who were always round the corner. Extremely pet friendly place makes it a clear winner for any outdoor dining.
4
Went there for team dinner. We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere was good. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. Will consider going back for team dinner again.
4
Foods was great especially mussels in white wine, I wish more though. Great ambiance, ideal place for gathering and without much of noise.
3
Canopy Garden Dining is only suitable for casual and family gathering. It is not ideal for having serious meeting/ discussion with corporate clients as it is just too noisy and tables are placed too close to each other.
3
Located within Bishan Park really helps bring out the lush and green feel, adding ambience points for brunch. However food was pricey and below expectations
4
Canopy provides a value for money 3 course set lunch. I had the mushroom soup, lobster pomodore and a coffee. Food has been consistent and this is my go to place for a reasonably priced set lunch. Food is consistent.
4
we chose canopy as we wanted to bring our dog along and was prepared for a hot lunch but was surprised that it was quite cooling with a cloudy day and the blower switched on.service and food wise was excellent. portions are great, keep it up! their wkday set lunch is a steal at $23.80++ since it included a normal sized salad, main and black coffee. Typical main course range from $16-21. hence the set lunch is very worthwhile.we ordered a set and a bangers and mash and found it hard to finish all the food. :)our bichon can sit on the chair only if we placed our own towel on the chair....thats ok...and they provide dog bowls in case yr dog is thirsty.we enjoyed our time there
4
It was an enjoyable Saturday morning, we booked the Canopy bcoz of their good food and our GFs birthday. We absolutely loved the Chicken Parmegiana and the Lobster Pasta. Service was good, and we ordered a pancake w fruits dessert as her Bday Cake! It was delish as well. Will definately go Back again for more !!
3
Key appeal to me was the venue. It is located at Bishan Park and just a short walk from the car park. Setting of the restaurant was casual and there were many with family or friends. Acoustic if the place was not great though (seated indoor). Food was average overall. The carbonara and the bacon pizza wasnâ€™t too bad though.
3
Somewhat eclectic menu. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her order of eggs benedict, which came with gammon ham and some greens. My order of bomba paella rice al nero was served with a chicken cutlet-- unusual combination, but is fairly ok; would've preferred some more seasoning either in the rice or in the chicken. Service is above average-- warm and accommodating. The bathrooms are clean too. Quite recommendable to people looking for a gathering place in this area of Singapore
4
It's always nice to head down to Canopy for Brunch. With the good music and food and lots of beautiful furry pets surround you, what other ways would you spend your Sunday?
4
Service waiters especially the male are attentive to children and cater to their needs. We have been back twice as children remembers. Please continue this standard and keep it up.
4
Nice place to chill and relax. Second time here for Sunday brunch and I’ll definitely be back again. It’s a dog friendly cafe too!
4
Nice place for family to dine in for lazy weekend morning. Tried the eggs benedict and its nicely done.
4
Restaurant is located within Bishan Park. Accessible by car and bus. Tried the executive lunch promotion which includes salad/soup, a main course and a drink. Reasonably priced at $23.80++. Food was good. A good lunch experience!
4
Its a cosy dining place! With friendly staff to suggest their menu and new ones.
The food is yummy and my teenagers love it too!
3
Went with 9 people and after booking there was no table for us ready. The food is an interesting mix of cultures. Strange combinations. I had a smoked duck salad that was an entree but tiny. Only 2 choices of white wine by the bottle. Reasonable pricing. Service average. Location and views are wonderful. Stick to breakfast I think.
4
Back to satisfy my craving for their signature date pudding. Still as good as before with its sweetness counterbalances by the vanilla ice-cream and strawberry slices.There is an executive 3-course set lunch promotion for a short period which is indeed good value for money. The alfresco dining is very conducive on a cool day where one can breathe fresh air and admire the scenic park views naturally
4
Nice dining experience in a beautiful green setting of Bishan park. Love the ease of parking. Good food and service.
1
When we arrived there was no one at the door and we had to enter the restaurant to ask for seats. The place is huge and there's only 3 staff, 1 serving, 1 in kitchen, 1 at the bar. We asked the waitress if we could use the chope vouchers and she said yes, without any other clarification. She took our orders, a set lunch (salad, meal and 1 drink) and a sandwich. Only after serving us the same waitress mention that the voucher is not valid for the set meal. As a result we had to split our orders and end up spending $70 ($50 voucher and $20 top up). We also only got a small salad as part of the meal but charged as a full salad price. This is disgusting, cheating behavior that demeans the purpose of Chope and we will not visit this restaurant again and also have doubts over using Chope. The first time we use Chope and we are scarred
4
3rd visit to Canopy and experience has been good though it can be noisy if with young kids. Staff is attentive and food is good though price may be overpriced.
Like the ambience and surrounding and will visit again.
5
Always enjoyed the pork chop which is huge on a bed of potato mash and a big bouquet of broccoli. The beef cheeks melt in your mouth and substantial. Value for money.
4
The food was good and the ambience was comfortable.
Except for some guest at the next table was pretty loud.
4
Very nice environment for good breakfast with families friends. The waffle is nice. The staff is alert too
4
We had an enjoyable evening at Canopy on 4.9.17. The ambience was good. Service was pleasing. "Ace" was friendly and warm. Servers had genuine smile on them. Our only complain is we did not have enough of the good time. ^^Will come again and will recommend to others. Thank you for making the dining experience great.
3
The food wasn't very fantastic. Service wasn't attentive, no one came to clear the empty soup bowls. Waited long time for my pasta but was there catching up with friend so didn't bother me much. But table was filled with empty plates when we are done and for a very long time. No one came to clear them
3
Had a short walk to through Bishan park before dinner st this restaurant. Chose to sit outside to cool off but towards dusk, found too many mosquitoes teeming around. Changed to indoor after nudging the staff 3 times to find us seats indoors. Food was mediocre- the standard pasta/pizza/ burgers fare. Decent and somewhat tasty. A good option after a good walk through the park with the famil
4
As the title of my review went, had another satisfying lunch at the Canopy. It was a cool Sunday morning and when I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted by a huge jar of ice water - the waitress remembered that I love ice water. Food was lovely as usual - I had angus beef burger with fries. Fries were so satisfying that they remained crunchy till the last bit. Looking forward to my next meal at Canopy
2
All the way took taxi with my Italian friend to Canopy, was disappointed with the bland Egg Benedict. Not enough Hollandaise sause. Sauce was too thick n no salt. Poach egg was too wet n soaked d bread. The sautee muchroom was also bland and rubbery. We had no choice to ask for KETCHUP...haizzz. A professional chef always Taste, Taste, Taste his food for seasoning or flavor before serving to customer
4
Liked the relaxing ambience here very much, so came back to taste test other foods. If you are going to order more than one course, you must definitely go for their Executive Set Lunch which is more economical then. The Catalan Wilted Spinach was filled with an awesome amount of very fresh pine nuts and walnuts although I don't mind if they can be a little more generous with their sherry soaked raisins. I asked the waitress what was the difference between the Eggs Benedict Grande and their Eggs Benedict Classic and she said that the difference is that the Grande has the serrano ham which is more expensive than the Classic's honey baked ham. The Grande is not bad but perhaps cos I am not used to the tomato sofrito that was added, that was why I don't quite like this dish. They are very generous with the sautÃ©ed mushrooms and greens. In fact, cos I have had the spinach earlier, that was why I can't finish the mushrooms & greens served although they were delicious and fresh. The set ended with a cup of tea and I enjoyed my meal. As usual, service is good. Wheelchair accessible place with clean wheelchair toilet. Pets allowed outside restaurant too
5
Had our brunch there the first time and everything was great! Especially their service, will visit there again!
4
Food is good and its pretty kids friendly as it is not too squeezy in terms of table arrangement therefore when my kids walk around, they are not worried of bumping into another table. They are also able to run about at the bishop park.
5
Tried a few dishes, loved their pizzas and cabonara. Lovely place for gathering, has both outdoor and indoor seatings.
5
Love the beautifulambience. Food and wine was good. And this place stays open till late! Will be here again!
4
Had to sit outdoors because that's where the TV is so has to endure the 2nd hand smoke from other patrons. Service at times were slow due to the large crowd. Other than these, everything else was excellent
3
Chope apps is great. However dining experienxe let down. Waiters/waitresses avoid eye contact and left waiting akwardly. Need to signal many times to place orders and requests for serving plates. Not even peak hours. Embarrassed to bring guests to this over rated place
4
Great little spot with a true European feel in the middle of the park. Excellent food, we had a platter of mixed starters, the crispy pork belly, beef burger, steak and pizza, my young son had the carbonara. Staff are friendly and service is good. Would I go back, yes, itâ€™s a great spot
4
Nice ambience ...was told that theres oni outdoor seatin due to an event tat day, was expectin it to b v warm...but they gave us a table with the "fan/cooler" just nex to us...was thoughtful of them as i have 2toddlers with us. food was great ..service not too bad...not as slow as what reviews mentioned..probably a new group of serving staff...will b back thr again
5
Went with hubby for a decent dinner, overall good experience. Price is reasonable especially for cod fish. But truffle fries can be better with truffles flakes.
3
Back again for dinning. Had cod fish this time round and is nice. Ambience is nice but if crowded he place is a bit warm and ventilation can be improved
4
Service rendered was pleasant but seats given was too squeezy when there is so many empty seats around. ):
5
Cozy place for small gathering. Nice ambience and food is good as well. Staff are attentive to our needs.
3
Redemption vouchers should include happy hour orders. Ordered food for 2 and had 2 beers during happy hours.
2
The seating indoors is too noisy due to the bad acoustics. The fried chicken thigh in my espanol bomba rice was too dry and bland. The squid ink bomba rice was nothing special too. We tried the the beef cheek bourguignon but it was too greasy and the sweet potato hash could have better as a mash instead of cubes swimming in the grease. Second time in this restaurant. It was better on a weekday when it was less crowded.
4
Have been coming here for gatherings with friends primarily for drinks, however decided to start early one evening and decided to have dinner as well.We tried the pastas, buffalo wings, truffle fries... all were good! The only slight disappointment was the bacon pizza as the crust was thicker than expected and soggy. Drinks were as usual - they do have an extensive menu. While the total bill wasn't cheap - about 200+ for 5pax - we're likely to stick with this gathering location.
4
I went in the evening this time and I was quite impressed by the nice ambience and the good selection of music. You can totally relax in the nice atmosphere. The truffle fries is a must try. If I am not wrong, the truffle fries are not available in the morning/brunch menu. What I think is lacking is the staff at the outdoor space. During that period while I was dining, I hardly see any staff at the outdoor space
5
Had planned a birthday surprise for a friend and the staff contacted me beforehand to discuss the logistics of it simply based on a remark that I had left in the reservation enquiry! It made the surprise a total success and we all had a good time there.What helped manage our expectations was also reading the reviews online beforehand so we were aware that a slight wait would be necessary. Didn't have to wait that long though since the staff were always ready to help us within the shortest time possible
1
food standard drop a lot as compared to last time. menu variety become very limited with not much choices, price goes up instead.service was inefficient and bad. takes very long for orders to be taken , ask for ice water but nobody serve us. food served without cutlery. ask for condiment but takes very long to come. overall very bad experience, will NOT visit again
3
We dined here over the weekend with 2 kids and 1 chihuahua. We'd usually go to Robertson Quay for pet friendly brunches and it was nice to be somewhere green and leafy with places for the kids and dog to explore. I ordered the crab pasta which was one of the chef's recommendations but isn't something I'd come back for - there were bits of shell, the crab is bitty and not very fresh, and the pasta is out of a packet. I still rate this as a 4 because it's a nice change from the places in Robertson Quay (i.e. it's not about the booze and it's nice to have a little walk after brunch) - I'd return to give the food another chance
5
Lovely sunlit interior, extremely prompt service staff, food arrived quite fast too. We ordered a pot of tea each and the eggs benedict. Food was not too bad, I would have preferred my poached egg yolks more runny but that's a personal preference. Ambience was lovely, I really liked that it was pretty quiet until a large group of >10 arrived with kids and the place turned rather noisy I couldn't really hear my own conversation. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience.
4
Located in bishan park. Had the beef cheek benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the beef cheeks were so soft and flavourful.
4
Canopy never fails on its pet-friendly policy. Big or small furry kids, all will be welcomed. One aspect in service which may require more polishing is that the staff tens to "hide" in the aircon area and obliviously to the outdoor customers needing their service.
2
Food was just ok but expensive, very noisy place. Staff was ok and welcoming. We ordered at the same time but not all dishes arrived together. Won't go there.
3
Nice Green Oasis in a Park. Good location for a break. Good food choice however downside is that taste wise is not the best fabulous you would expect.
4
This place is a great gathering place for families and Friends on weekends , the ambience was real good. We ordered the cantana salad and clam chowder and both turn out to be really good.
3
Foods not serve in order...one of the main course was serve before the starters. But nice atmosphere.
3
The service was a little lacking probably due to a weekend. They forgot one of our orders even prompting for one hour
5
Been to Canopy during the day but wasn't impressed. This time we went for dinner and food is so much better!!!
4
Been a few times, never disappoint me. Food and drinks is great. Good service and nice place to hang out with friends and family.
3
We have been to Bishan Park many times but never have a chance to dine there although we wanted to. It was a place that looks so entirely relaxing, a place for a cup of tea and a book to read while admiring the surrounding park. Finally there for lunch with my mum. We ordered the Crabmeat Aglio Olio and Espanol Bombay Rice as recommended by the waitress as we want to share. Noting that the Aglio Olio was stated as spicy, we asked for it to be made extra spicy. The dish was served tasty but not spicy at alleven though we can see pieces of red chillies! The waitress confirmed that instructions were passed on!? The squid ink bomba rice topped with sunny side up egg and mentaiko mayo was very oily but the lifesaver was the fried chicken thigh that came with the dish was absolutely delicious with its crispy skin. Finally their signature dessert of Sticky Date Pudding served with Gula Melaka Butterscotch & Vanilla ice cream was an absolute MUST-TRY. The smell of the Gula Melaka is so good that I was already salivating even before trying. This dessert is a tat sweet though. Service is not bad. It's a wheelchair friendly place with a spacious and clean wheelchair toilet. Pets are allowed if you sit outside the restaurant
4
Most foods we ordered are nice. There's a pork belly pasta, kind of a fusion, more like Italian Bak-cho Mee, not something I'll order again.
Service is good generally.
A conducive dining place for small gp gathering.
5
The Ambiance is really good, staffs are friendly too!
Good food and beer! never goes wrong.
Will visit again!
4
Good ambience. Pet friendly. Food can be better and service is not too bad. Just got to wait for quite some time to be seated, but food are service are quite fast
4
Service was good esp from the male service staff. Only thing was the amount of flies and ants at the outdoor seating area which was a bit of a downer
3
Like the atmosphere more than the food...feels great being in the outdoor amist the plants and flowers.
4
Good location with ample parking. Choice for both indoor and outdoors. Food selection was good. Drinks were awesome.
4
I went to Canopy again and ordered their angus burger. The food was tasty and the fries were surprisingly delicious. Attentive and polite staff. Price a little on the high side.
3
Dinning in the garden concept is nice, but ventilation should improve, a bit warm, especially the restaurant placed a lot of tables and chairs. If crowded, it will be very uncomfortable. Food and service are ok
4
Great ambiance and a peaceful place to have have a good meal/cocktail away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Dog friendly and regular special promotions.
3
It was raining on Sunday morning, we were sit at the side By the window. The staff was doing cleaning and wiping the window right beside us while we were enjoying the egg Benedict and macchiato. Not bothering with it but just uncomfortable with it.
4
Easily accessible; price range is reasonable. Good for families and friends to have their gatherings. Pets friendly too.
4
The portions a little smaller especially the amount of lobster meat in the lobster pomodoro. Kids enjoyed the easter egg hunt.
4
Going to Canopy is always a pleasant experience with the good food and service. However it could be pricey and may not be your every weekend kind of experience, unless of course when you're super wealthy.
5
It was a beautiful day, good service, and food. N especially loved the outdoor seating. Greenery N quiet atmosphere was great.
3
Had dinner with 5 other families. The ambience was relaxing amidst lush greenery as it is located within AMK-Bishan. The food was alright, though easily forgettable.. quite average. We thought it was over-priced though. Would think twice about returning.
3
I visited Canopy last Saturday and ordered a set of egg benedicts as well as a plate of crabmeat aglio olio, with a little additional spice as I love spicy food. I am a big fan of Aglio Olio and would usually ask for extra spice whenever I order aglio olio in other restaurants. Egg benedicts was quite ordinary. Aglio Olio was EXTREMELY SPICY. I've never eaten such a a spicy bowl of aglio olio in my entire life. Even when I cook it on my own, I usually add a maximum of 3 chilli padi for a normal portion bowl of aglio olio. That was my level of spicy. This one was maybe double the amount of chilli padis or even more! It spoils the taste of the aglio olio. Not sure if the chef was in a bad mood on that day to entertain my extra spice so he threw in damn a lot of chilli padi or?! I did not ask for a new bowl as I did really ask for it to be cooked with a little additional spice. I just thought that the chef would have a better gauge on the spiciness level if I only asked for a little bit more spicy. I had a hard time digging out all the chilli padi, and I werent kidding but the amount of chilli sits on almost 1/4 of the bowl. That was the amount of chilli that was used to cook that meal. (I took a photo of it) Despite removing all the chilli padi, My throat and stomach was burning so bad from the spiciness and I had to calm it down with a cup of iced mocha. Even then I was perspiring so badly and took 15 mins to finally calm down..
2
Nice location but the food and service for Sunday brunch was dismal. Reserbed a table at 10.30am, seated on time and proceeded to order the burger, pancake (note, the menu stated pancakes but it is just 1 giant pancake) and "eggs royal". Food came out in drips and drap, first the burger, then a 10 minute wait for the pancake and another 10 minute wait for the eggs. By the time the Mrs's eggs arrived my burger was frozen! Burger was dry (could be cause it was cold by the time I dug into it), mushrooms had no taste, butter was served from the peel top single serve packets, syrup and ketchup was served in plastic cups, pancake was fluffy but dry. The eggs though, were pretty good. All in all, food was borderline average and tje service wasnt there (no explanations were given by any of the staff either). Kudos to the runner though, literally the only one out of the whole service crew who had a smile on his face.
4
Came in with some friends after a morn pet event nearby. Had some food and drinks which weren't too bad and sat around for quite a bit more coz of the really beautiful greenery surrounding this restaurant. An ideal place even for a solo traveller to walk in, sit back and relax
4
First time here and very impressed. You can sit indoors or out and as its surrounded by high trees and vegetation you can forget the urban concrete jungle for a while. The food was well cooked and presented if a little pricey. The pork chop was excellent and the seared salmon good as well. Well worth the effort to get there.
5
The restaurant is very nice. The staff are very accomodating. The food are great though it is pricey. I have been here several times and they continue to improve their menu. It was a great dining for us with our friends and kids. We were a big group but was still accomodated. It is located in a very nice park so you could walk around after dining
4
Desserts were not bad. Cod was well done too, nice marinade. Best thing was the location in the leafy park.
5
Very nice n quiet surrounding, within the park. Food was good and serve fast, polite and friendly staffs. Loves the german sausages platter, although portion was big.
4
Nice atmosphere which allows you to converse with friends. Food was pretty good. Location within the park, similar to what you have in botanic gardens. Would appreciate if the staffs are a bit more attentive in refilling water.
2
Food was sadly disappointing, but ambience was good.
Overall not so good considering the price paid. Not worth it unless you can call $150 spare change
5
Nice ambience for Valentine day, food is good and staff are friendly. The venue is deco with valentine day theme. Toilet is clean.
5
The place was good with nice atmosphere and good food. The greenery around makes it look beautiful. Nice place for taking pictures
5
The food was great especially the soup and dessert. Love the lava cake with coconut ice cream and the soup was marvellous.
5
Awesome and beautiful place for outdoor chill dining and catch up with friends. Definitely would come again. Thank you :)
5
Good food, great ambience perfect environment in the middle of AMK-Bishan park. Portion of the vegetable dish could be slightly lesser? As we were filled up even before the entree dish. Plating leaves much more to be desired but the dishes tastes alot better than it looks. Overall a good experience.
1
My guests ordered a set dinner, which consisted of a main course, soft drinks and a dessert. The waitor did not even bother to ask which soft drinks or dessert, and the worst part is that they actually forgot to serve the soft drink and dessert. Horrible Service that's very unprofessional
4
A short walk from the carpark led us to a small diner/café in Bishan park. Nice layout. Great service! Delicious food! Noisy run-around children at the next table almost spoiled our dinner time but thankfully, the party of 7 left before our food was served.
4
Ideally located. Nice ambience to dine in nature setting. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are friendly too.
5
Lovely Catalan Spanich & affordable set lunch served by attentive and friendly staff !!!
Would drop by again soon!
4
Nice restaurant set in the middle of Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park. Ambience is nice and the service staff are friendly.
We had a pizza and the sampler platter which were good.
Might consider coming back for drinks and snacks next time.
4
Good Ambience with indoor and outdoor sitting. The food was very good especially the Wagyu beef burger. The burger was quite pricey though. Ideal for gatherings with friends and family.
5
Loved the ambience of the place. Food arrived promptly and it was all very satisfying. My folks loved the salmon! Although I felt mushroom burger could have a bit more OMPH.. maybe the buns need a bit of toasting so it has more crunch to it. Service was excellent, staff were efficient and polite. My parents and I had a really good time here :
5
Its been our 3rd year running now that we have chosen to celebrate my wife's birthday at Canopy. Actual day was 19th and we went on 21st. Been receiving complimentary slice of cake on our last 2 visits, but wife decided to keep mum this time. Nevertheless we enjoy the good food, friendly and warm service from them always.
3
We love the ambience. The food is below par. Here's our order:Mushroom Burger ($15++)Unintegrated burger. Mushroom Swiss from BK Tastes better. Corn Beef Hash ($12++) adding sunny side up ($3++) and toast ($3++). Add on pricing are ridiculous. $3 for an egg???! Corn beef hash is has no other taste but salt. Latte ($5++) a home Nespresso machine will give the same effect and taste. Flat white ($5++) a little latte art earns some brownie points. Total bill: $50 I think we will return only for the ambience. Food wise, no.

The food I had (agilo olio) was really good! Tasted really different from most aglio olio served everywhere else. Had a really unique taste. Ambience was lovely too. Price is slightly on the steep side, but I guess you pay what you get! Oh yes, service was pretty much on the slow side though during the time I paid the dining place a visit

Good food on new year eve . Crowd seem to be well manage on the eve of PH which is pretty well done . Doesn't compromise the quality of the food too except that the mains portion served on that day , slow cooked duck was pretty disappointing due to its pathetic portion .
4
This was the second time dining here. Very comfortable dining at this restaurant, relaxing and the wine and champagne is really good. Definitely will visit again and recommend to more friends.
3
where is the Christmas tree? We didn't realize is the Christmas Eve...but just a normal day in café/restaurant..
3
Do not expect too much on Food, taste is average which you can cook at home . However it's a nice place If you want to spend a lazy afternoon or have coffee/tea to catch up with Friend.
4
good ambience and nice food and awesome company. it was nice to walk around the park after that too.
4
It was the perfect Sunday brunch w/ family on a special day. We all enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food. Wasn't my 1st time there, but 1st for the rest, they just loved it. Relaxing place 😃
5
Food was great, pricing was re seasonable. Service staff are very courteous and polite and engages in conversations on food. Good explaination of wine, would definitely be back here again.

My family are regulars at Canopy. At our last visit, while waiting for a table, I checked with a waiter if we could occupy an empty table. He said it was ok so we moved towards the table. At this point, the Manager (Ang Moh chap) stepped in and said " you wait here... don't teach me how to run my restaurant..." I was shocked by his tone. Since I was a regular at the restaurant, my family and I are surprised he had shown such an negative attitude. It ruined our evening.I promised myself that I will never return to Canopy. No one deserves to be treated with such rudeness

We had used a gift voucher. While I understand certain conditions that come with it, there should be flexibility if customer wants to top up the difference in price. On the food, the salmon came raw and the burger was mediocre. Can give this restaurant a miss
5
Organised a gathering with my friends on Sunday morning. Had to make 2 reservations due to the fact that we have over 15 people, and the restaurant only allowed reservations of up to 8 people. Nevertheless they very kindly accommodated us, and even helped us add more tables when more than the expected number of people arrived. No fuss no hassle at all. Food was great, slightly on the pricey side but the ambience made up for it. Coffee was more than decent. Free parking nearby. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a Sunday morning, as compared to my previous experiences at the place
4
A must go to place whenever I bring my pet shiba inu to the dog run. Canopy serves a wide selection of western cuisines. I love its beef burger most. The staff there serve with big smiles which makes the dining experience very comfortable. The most important aspect of this place is that it is super pet friendly. No pet will be rejected at its premises. I like Canopy for its easy and relaxing environment. Try going for brunch or dinner and you will feel differently there! The only suggestion I have for Canopy would be to consider credit card discounts as meals there are not cheap. :
3
Alternative decent place for business discussion . Easy parking makes it an ideal place for a busy weekday lunch meeting venue. Food was pretty good too.
4
Great atmosphere, great food.
Great gathering place for family members and friends.
I hope they could be able to write wordings on the cake.

This is my 5th visit. The set lunch menu is price worthy and good quality. With Good service. Will try the dinner menu.
4
Has been a regular at this restaurance for years. Food remains delicious but do note that there is not a lot of variety. For diners who are constantly looking for different menus this might not suit them as after a few sessions you might get bored with the food be it breafast, lunch or dinner menu. However what keeps me coming back is the nice ambience (quiet and romantic at night either indoor or outdoor). Breakfast or Brunch hours on weekends tend to be a bit noisy, sometimes to an unbearable extent when the place is crowded with diners all speaking loudly. There were few occasions I had to go over to another rstn opp this place the moment I stepped in as it was really too noisy to dine in comfort.Nevertheless the food is still tasty. The Happy Hours offer for beer is really value for money at about $12 (original S$28) if you order before 8pm on weekday nights. Very large glass of beer and there were a lot of varieties (type). Do note the prices quite be pricey depending on what you order. I was dining with total of 5 pax ordering 4 main courses, 1 set dinner, 1 fried sampler to share, 2 beers and 2 cup of ice cream the bill came to S$271
3
Great place to have a gathering in terms of the atmosphere and space, plus it's strategic location amidst the green. However, food wasn't fantastic. Not that great a variety. Not much flexibility in terms of their lunch sets as well, couldn't add ice to our included drink.
4
We went over for Sunday brunch and it was crowded. Told to sit outdoors and loved the surroundings. Service level was good.My only disappointment was the food served was not warm. It was at room temperature so I wonder how long ago it was cooked. My husband's food was warm though.Apart from that, you pay $7 to 8 for juices which was expensive to me for a cafe at Bishan park
4
I'm very pleased that the staff at Canopy took notice of the note I had included in my Chope reservation, and provided my mom w a surprise birthday cake, although we were planning to leave already. Place is quite noisy though, so we did not want to stay for long
3
Short walk from car park. Fairly spacious dining area. Weekday 2 course set lunch $18 for soup and choice of main course for my husband. I chose beef cheeks with egg Benedict. Food is ok but we didn't quite like the spice/ seasoning used for both food items. The coffee and cake add on for $6.50 was enjoyable though.
4
We are staying at Bishan St.22 in past 3years ago, the Restaurant just opposite our Apartment very near just a few minutes will reach the place.. sometimes we will have a dinner there when we lazy to go out.. very beautiful place feel like dine in the Garden, natural park, we like the ambience over there. They open for breakfast, Lunch & Dinner, during weekend will be fully booked. Good recommend for chill up or dining in the natural Garden.
5
Meal: 4/5. We had arugula salad and sausage sampler (this was during Oktoberfest period). Servings were well portioned. Atmosphere: 4/5. We went in the evening. Nice ambiance. We noticed that there were lots of patrons going here with their pet dogs. Best time to go: Perhaps morning brunch and early evening light supper.Service: 4/5.
4
loved the salmon, goes really well overall except the peas were a little bitter for some reason. the skin was very nicely crisp this time. cold pressed juices are a bit more ex here. service was noticeably better this time.
5
Loved the food and the ambiance at Canopy (:
It's a great place to relax and have gatherings with friends.
3
Food was average. Drink list was good with lots of variety. However, after 2 bottle of wines, we were thirsty & we were upset that the refill of ice water is chargeable at $1 each!
3
Good Food Good Ambience
Good for friends catch up
Located at Bishan Park, have a walk after a meal.
Good for family meal
5
Celebrating friend's birthday, kid friendly, brought 1 year old, 2 year old and 4 year old along without problems.
4
Everyone was really attentive. Weekday dinner set was good value for money. Had a great dining experience.
4
It was our family's first time dining at this restaurant. The truffle fries, angus beef and pork rack was so good! The staff was also friendly.
5
Went canopy twice for friends gathering and it is one of the few places in Singapore which allows pets and a dog park nearby. Food is great!
4
The food in itself was quite good, but the prices are too expensive for the size of the servings they offer. Prices should certainly be inclusive of service and GST. I always find it tacky to read at the bottom of the menu "prices subject to 10% service charge and 7% GST". The location is very nice but sadly they reserve the best part of the outdoor seating for smokers. This is a park. It should be all non-smoking! Service is very nice and quick. Get rid of the smoking section, make prices all inclusive at their current levels and increase the size of the servings and I will go back
5
Nice environment. However the staff might be New. Showed my staff pass to have discount but the Indian staff without checking with superior, immediately told me no discount untill I told him to check with his superior first before commenting no. Nevertheless the overall is grea
5
Loved the ambience and friendly staff! Eggs benedict is a must try! Affordable price and large servings!
5
Nice ambience but there were some ants that dropped on to the table from the leafs . Staff was friendly and helpful. Excellent !
2
Located in bishan park, an ideal venue for casual meals with family/friends after a walk. However, food is less than average for its price. Iced latte was diluted, mushroom soup is so normal and breakfast dishes can be given a little more effort.
4
Staffs are attentive and friendly. Foods served very fast to our table. Really like the ambience in this restaurant.
4
The food was good if not great, the drinks pleasant, but the ambience, simplicity of decor, and service make Canopy well worth a visit.
Take a stroll through the park, then chill here with a cold one.
Lovely.
5
It was rather a pleasant change with Canopy. More food varieties and food were rather good and pricing wise is alright too! Just that there were quite a number of waiters, service was rather slow.
5
Went by at 4pm on a weekday afternoon. Decent happy hour wines at $39 a bottle, and had a really good cheese platter (one of the best I have ever had), that came with five soft cheeses (haha, Asian tastebuds), some dried fruits, some pesto sauce, some hummus and really nice bread that was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Wish I had more weekday afternoons free! Oh yeah, and we brought our puppy along since it is pet-friendly. :
2
We found crab shells in their pasta and the dishes are generally overpriced. A glass of mixed fruit juice costs SGD14. The service is slow with the number of staff they have. When we asked for salt and pepper, we could hear staff saying loudly in the background, "what for!?"The ambience was good being in Bishan park with lush greenery
5
I have been to Canopy several times already because I live nearby and it is just so convenient to go to especially when I am celebrating something of importance as it is just a stone throw's away. Plus, the fact that it is located in the middle of Bishan Park, you can walk around after good dining experience.The Restaurant got a very nice interiors, very classy. You won't mind having dates here as it is very nice place to have chit chats. It can just be a bit loud depending on the other guests who are dining at the moment you are there (especially if there are lots of children, or friends in celebratory mood). The food, I have no particular suggestion, but I'd say all are worth the try. Steaks, Pork Rack, Fish dish, and Pastas are recommendable. Some items are a bit over priced I think, nevertheless, most are reasonably priced. Wines are a bit expensive.I have encountered one rude server when I was there one time, but it is unfair to base my review on just one encounter because all other times that I've been there, the experience is pleasant. A special shout out to the lady manager who is very nice and accomodating.Overall, It was a great experience.Located 3 Bus stops away from Bishan MRT (Red and Yellow Line), Marymount MRT (Yellow Line) and Ang Mo Kio MRT (Red Line). And you have to walk inside the park after alighting the bus. Google out the location and go explore it yourself and see for yourself this beauty tucked within the beautiful Bishan Park
4
The outside seating area is dog friendly. Well behaved dogs welcome. Had a brunch for four which was served quickly and efficiently by a very good team of waiters. Prices all good. The flat white coffee and the iced lattes were excellent. The Beef cheek Benedict was very good. Proper Hollandaise sauce and succulent, very rich beef. Not for those who shy away from fat. A slightly acidic accompaniment to cut through the richness would make it a superb meal. The Eggs Benedict Grande was excellent as were the mixed grill breakfast. All ingredients were of good quality with fresh grilled mushrooms, good bacon and more than acceptable sausages.Great park for a walk around afterwards to get the digestion going
4
Pretty good choices of food and they have renovated with better seating :) Wheelchair and kids friendly. The outdoor seatings has a huge screen showing soccer matches. Great for the guys.
3
food was pretty average, could do with more variety on the menu. they are crowded during weekends and service staff tend to be short handed. I definitely like their classy interior which makes the dining experience comfortable and warm.
4
My friends and i enjoyed ourselves at Canopy. The service staff were very friendly, the food came promptly and everything was cooked very well. Would go back
4
Good service and cared to arrange tables to accommodate my party
Chicken on waffles can be more seasoned. Need more heat or acidity
4
We came because of a promotion so for that price, the food and ambience was lovely. Great place to bring if you have pets too!
3
This restaurant was chosen as it was located within the park and dogs were allowed. All the staff were not accommodating. They reserved more energy in telling us dog can't do this.. Dogs not allowed to drink from takeaway containers etc rather than do their service like topping our water glasses. Don't hire staff who are not dog friendly.
4
Love that it's dog friendly. Brunch food is better than the dinner food - recommend the mushroom toast. Service has always been friendly. Avoid the mojito because I've spotted rotten mint leaves in mine. Choose outdoor seats if you can take the heat (there are giant cooler fans) because the interior is extremely noisy on busy days - it's glass walled so i guess noise bounces off the walls.
4
The cafe is located in the midst of Bishan Park. Perfect place to enjoy your meals listening to the sounds of nature and feeling relaxed in the greenery environment.I took a three course dinner started with smoked duck salad as appetiser, main course of Sakura chicken and ended with red date pudding, my all-time favourite dessert.
4
We got a table inside the restaurant which is nice & cool in hot & humid Singapore.Was pleasantly surprised with the meat dishes we ordered. The ribeye steak was tasty & fresh. The Lamb was well charred on the outside and the Pork rack was juicy. The lobster pasta & cabonara were good too and quite a decent portion
4
It's fairly big place compared to corner stoner,,great selection of wines and food too. They have a sports bar at the back that's the smoking area. The food is quite good too. Many brought their families and even dogs to this place. Very animal and babies friendly
5
Love the eggs benedict at Canopy.
Good ambience & they have a new item called the beef cheek eggs benedict which we tried and was really good.
4
Contrary to the many bad reviews, we had wonderful dinning experience. Was seated within 10 mins. Order taken shortly n food was served within half an hour! Portion was generous n taste was good. Thanks to the super generous 50.38% discount off the bill !!!
1
The Angus burger was burnt and dry , coffee tasted so diluted. Service was not bad, ambience good.
Overall was rather disappointing.
4
The AL fresco dining area is great for dogs and it's under a shady area. Food served was great and delicious. Located in bishan park which makes it convenient for dog owners.
1
Lousy service! Take a long while to take orders after several request. Asked for lychee martini but served without lychee. Found extra items from the bills!
5
We ordered two mains and a side of truffle fries. The fries were superbly done and our mains were impressive too. With the entertainer, it cost us only 50 bucks and was worth it. We'll be back!
3
Recently had dinner here with the family. It's a pet-friendly place in a beautiful garden setting and a gem that way for residents of Ang Mo Kio. Unfortunately service was sub-par, I guess a chronic problem with many places throughout the island these days. Most disappointing, vegetarian items on the menu were not available as early as 7pm on a Saturday night! That is poor planning on the part of the kitchen management. The goat cheese salad was decent but the dressing was missing finesse and sweetness. Onion rings used cheap onions and were soggy in minutes. My glass of wine was never delivered, though the waiter did finally offer to bring it at no cost when he realised I had never received it. Dessert was delivered in stages and that too after reminding waiters
1
We made dinner reservations at 8pm. Arrived there 8pm sharp and waited outside the restaurant door to be seated. We were the first in line. After 10 mins, there were still no sight of any service staff. We were thinking that they might have a lack of staff so it's understandable that they might be too busy to see that we're outside the door. So we went into the restaurant but stood near the entrance and waited. The lady supervisor approached us and we mentioned that we have reservations at 8pm. She said okay, went pass us, out the door and started serving other customers. She brought them in, settled them down, before remembering that "oh ya they're still standing there". We stood there like idiots staring at her bring in 3 diff groups of people in. Is it the restaurant have a hidden policy to make customers who made reservations, look like idiots waiting there? Hmmm guess you'll have to ask them. What I'm trying to say is, there's a reason why customers make reservations, so that they can beat the queue and get the seats first. And even if I didn't make any reservations, I don't see why she can serve others behind me first, when we're the first in line? Is it because we so kanchiong, went in even tho it says wait to be seated? So she want to show us who's the boss here and that kanchiong will not give you any advantage? I really can't comprehend her behaviour. You can argue that she's preparing your reserved table for you so she serve other ppl first. But hello, she brought us to this table with no "reserved" tag and it just look like a walk in table. Not to mention that there's only two ppl eating. How long do you need to prepare the table? Moving on, the food was a major disappointment. We had wagyu beef burger, lobster pasta, Shirley temple & sticky date pudding. Burger was tasteless and the Shirley temple was just awful. Lobster pasta was just below average but when compared to the burger, it's like heaven on earth. You order alr then you will understand lah. I don't have very good vocab to describe terrible food. The only thing that I can compliment about is their vanilla ice cream which comes with the sticky pudding. The sticky pudding also CMI. But I think their ice cream is from Haagen Dazs so no surprise that it will obviously stand out. LOL. We also found like a small little fly in the shirley temple in the middle of meal. We can't confirm that if it died at the hands of the bartender or just decided to commit suicide in the drink when it's on our table. So can't really put the blame anywhere, just suay lor. But have to really agree that they have good location and atmosphere in the restaurant. Well played. The payment was fast and smooth bcos aiya got money take, confirm fast what LOL. All in all, really not worth lor I think. It's like $35 for the wagyu beef burger then also not nice. Some more treat you like circus animal stand there, other diners see you like entertainment. I legit don't recommend unless you eat glass grow up, like to be treated like transparent or you have got a lot of money to waste on tasteless food. Can try going when they got promo, like 50.39% schooling promo which I did. But still regret ah, but also no choice cause I cheapo, want cheap but want good. But imagine the not cheapo ppl going this place to eat and paying the full amount for this type of meal and treatment

The restaurant is located middle of the bishan park so its very quiet and it has great atmosphere. Food quality is not bad and price is quite reasonable. However the service is so slow. Food wasnt served until we requested for a bill. Restaurant needs to improve on their service.

I went to this Canopy garden at Bishan with my family after my interesting morning walk at the Tree top in Macritchie reservoir. Upon arrival we were ushered to a table. When we were ready to order our food, a 'sour faced' staff came to take our orders and left. We ordered 2 soft drinks and a ice coffee together with our main dishes. About 15minutes later, we were served with 1 soft drink and a ice coffee. We told the staff immediately that there was 1 soft drink short that was not served. She replied, OK she will checked. Another 10minutes later, we told another staff that we have yet to get our soft drink serve. He went and nothing appears for the next 10minutes. Another 5 minutes passed, our food was served. We told her again that we have yet to get our drink served, she left and our drink didn't appear after another 10minutes. We caught another staff and requested for salt & pepper and chilli sauce, he said yes but never returned. We have almost finished our food and our soft drink still was not served, that is already more than 45minutes of waiting. I began losing my patience, I went to the bar counter and told another staff wearing a different uniform that I have a drink not served. She replied me and asked me to return to my seat. I observed she did not even instruct the counter staff to quickly dispense the soft drink (a normal Sprite), I waited to see what will happen next, she angrily asked me to return to my seat. I left the counter and return to my seat. Another 5minutes passed, she appeared outside the seating area and without my drink in her hand. She noticed me and then instructed another staff to go to the counter and get our missing drink. That is where I lost my cool and shouted at her to cancel my drink and send me the bill. With no apologies from her she argued with me and 5minutes later presented our bill. Another 3-4minutes later another staff presented us another bill. The staff is so quick to bill the customer, but so slow in responding the needs of the customers. The service is so bad that I will never consider another visit. The service is my worst experience

Was our second time celebrating a Birthday at Canopy. Must say it was a another happy and satisfying celebration dinner we had. Good food, happy and satisfying company attended by a group of friendly helpful staffs. Keep it up.
5
situated in the beautiful bishan amk park. this is an excellent place for brunch and afternoon tea. bring your kids along and they can play in the park while i had my meals.
3
Burger is quite nice but portion too small. Value for money if use Entertainer deal. So would encourage people to get the Entertainer deal before going.
4
Celebrated a cosy birthday dinner and it felt perfect. Good food quality, reasonable portions and creative cuisine.
3
Disappointed with my experience! The pasta was bland & lacking in oomph. The price for the fruit juices was exorbitant for basic ingredients...daylight robbery!
3
Had to wait quite a while for the main course. Also, the main course were served to my 2 other friends while it took another 15 mins for mine to be served. My food was the same as one of my friends. Had to rush to catch up ...
4
Good location. Nice area to go for a walk and let little ones run around. Good food. Relaxed setting.
3
Good ambience for couples but also great for family and friends gatherings! Mains variety are limited but we are satisfied with pork rack and truffle fries. Service team could be better thoug
2
We came on a late Saturday morning when it was not crowded. However, we had to wait for half and hour for the food. The service was very slow! I won't come again as the food was so-so
2
A pity this is a nice restaurant but food quality was disappointing. We had the egg benedict and bangers and mash which were nothing to be existed about.It was also hard to get the attention of staff and we were not the only guests who got a little frustrated trying to get someone's attention and waiting for our bill
5
Excellent staffs.
Very accommodative.
The food was amazing and the environment was just perfect to celebrate my Dad's birthday.
2
the moment we reached. No one bother to come over to and help to to proceed to the reserved table. We stand there one of the witress saw us while taking order and saw us. After taking order from customer she didn't even bother to entertain us. This is worst impression we had as compared to other visit we had 1 yr back.
4
Good food with a good price tag, plus it's dog friendly too. However, the smoothies are the same price as a main course, we found that absurd since it's not even alcoholic. Nevertheless, we are bound to revisit Canopy again anytime.
3
maybe it's PH ... maybe it's peak hours ... arrived 15mins earlier than my reservation time ... took them quite a while to take order, a bit of effort to get their attention. food was served rather fast not the drinks. getting the bill was another pain ... we left just before 12pm after an hour there ..

Hi! Need to raise out my frustrating experience with Canopy yesterday. We've reserved for dining at Canopy for the main reason that we ran out of coffee at home, so we decided to have brunch outside instead. We were looking forward to dine at Canopy as it will be our first time and the place looks cosy. We woke up the kids and my whole family took a cab from woodlands to canopy excitedly. Once seated there, it took at least 15 minutes before someone actually approached us. And to our horror, informing us that drinks like coffee and tea or juices will be served after 45 minutes... We right away left the place, very disappointed
3
had the most expensive item on the menu - beef tenderloin & lamb shanks. awesome quality food. however water had to be requested. dining space was confined - too close for comfort from next tables. when payment comes, the same big size lady who served us for a couple of times before still gave the same far from expectations service attitude. even if we were going to utilize any promo we are still good customers. probably not going back again. far too expensive food though quality is there. can easily find alternatives elsewhere with much desired service which can make our day brighter. and too noisy and echo-y for a cozy night. recommend a day visit or off peak
2
Went with my colleagues and most of us ordered their executive set lunch. Had to wait for almost 40 mins before our food arrive. The set lunch allows us to order ANY coffee, tea, or soft drinks by adding on $3. After order was placed for iced mocha and ice coffee, the waitress came back and said iced coffee needs to add on $2. And mocha another $1 on top of the $3. The management need to either change the menu or accept their commitment to customers.
3
For some reason, I was under the impression that the food ws Canopy was really good. So, it was to both my wife's and my disappointment when we tasted the Smoked Duck Salad, Canopy Burger and Salmon Broth. Uninteresting presentation, average taste, and definitely overpriced. Even though we were using the entertainer app for 1-for-1, we felt it wasn't really worth the money
3
Cod fish and pork was not bad. But they said truffle mash. It wasnt. Unfortunately, their lamb rack was rather disappointing. Tough and overdone.Don't order the cauliflower. It's really just cauliflowerService was quite slow, but they'll com

I never realize that a heartland park area restaurant could offer this level of cosy ambiance, fine dining.I saw this restaurant on the internet and I was surprised to see this being located in the outer skirts of Ang Mo Kio and Bishan. When I was on the internet, I did not read the specs of this restaurant carefully. I took it as a normal cafe where I can settle down for a good drink and some extraordinary desserts. But I went there, the restaurant was more into fine dining. Basically more on entree sides and I was amazed of their liquor collections. I did not expect this in a park.We walked in without any reservations about 4.45pm local time. The crowd started to come in after 5.30pm. I felt that their desserts were nothing special. I can get their desserts anywhere else. I could tell their food was mouth-watering. But since it was early evening and I am not into heavy dinners, my friend and I settled down for drinks. I took the Singapore Sling. It was awesome and I enjoyed my drink. I had a good chat with my friend and we will definitely return for more drinks!tI do not recommend this restaurant for children. This is a kind of place where adults will like to sit down and chill.I don't think I will like to have the children running around or making noises.The ambience was cosy and clean. The staff was friendly but their response time to attend to us is a little slow. Maybe there wasn't a staff overlooking the floor when we stepped in.The outdoor area was attracting us but the weather made us not to sit there. People were bring their pets and this was even more nice to sea. With the glass walls, we could enjoy the park, the nature, the sights. With a good drink on the hand, just right temperature, we could enjoy our Sunday evening
5
Service was beyond my expectations. Friendly and very accommodating as my 3 children can be rather picky.
I shall be returning on my next visit.

My husband and I decided to have supper last night at Canopy.
We walked in without reservations and were pleasantly surprised by the warm service.
The food arrived after a short wait. It was well-plated and delicious.
Overall very nice supper experience.
4
The Beef Cheek main course was delicious. I like the duck salad, apple crumble too. The free flow of warm water and the offer to loan me an umbrella makes the difference, it completes the thoughtful hospitality of Canopy.
5
Food was good and great ambience! Relaxing setting in the park. However food choices were slightly limited.
4
We ordered the Lobster Pomodoro (rate 4/5) , grilled breakfast(3/5) & fries(2.5/5).. Earl Grey tea was good (4/5)
1
I told the floor manager I having 6 guess and request for a join table. He says is not allow inside the bar area. Which in face during my last visit when we have 8 of us they do that for me.After that when food is served and we have no space to place the food order, the server just pass the food to our hand and letting us handle the plates by ourselves.We order coffee and so forgotten till we remind them and they forget or pork ribs order...
1
It was father's day and my son and i decided to treat my husband for dinner at canopy. I reached there at 8.30pm and ordered our food. The food was served promptly. We were talking and enjoying our dinner when suddenly at 9.20pm, the bill was given to us. I know the restaurant closes at 10.30pm. We were shocked the manager said that's the way but we can still sit and if we want can still order. I'm not sure what nonsense was that. We left after paying the bill
3
There is outdoor seating and indoor seating. In Singapore, weather is either too hot to sit outside or there is the threat of a sudden rain in addition to insects given the location so I strongly recommend indoor seating. We were a group of 13 so we made sure we secured a reservation in advance. Food is only so-so and the price is a little on the high side
2
Been here a couple of times and generally had good experiences. However, quite disappointed this time round. Asked for water and it never came. We ended up getting it, including refilling twice ourselves. The crab aglio olio was nice, bangers and mash was a decent portion. But the mushroom burger really needs some work. It was shockingly small, perhaps about 6-7cm across and only came with some fries. The whole plate was basically half empty and looked really pathetic. Staff are hit and miss i guess. A guy staff was friendlier and looked busy. The female staff, i am sorry to say, just looked pissed off with no smiles, including one who saw us walk through the door and instead of bringing us to a table, completely looked away. Canopy actually has a very nice setting. Pity about the experience.
2
Food was mediocre and service was lacklustre at best.We stood at the entrance for a while before someone acknowledged our presence.Honestly, we only went because of the Entertainer voucher but guessed we did not read the fine prints well enough. The 2 entrees we ordered were the Canopy Cheese Burger and the Breakfast Grill (usual breakfast fry up with sausages, choice of eggs, a slice of bread, salad, etc). At payment, we were informed that the Entertainer voucher is only valid for entrees listed under "Main Course" in the menu, which does not include the Breakfast Grill. Most people will consider the Breakfast Grill as a 'main course', but our bad since we did not peruse the menu hard enough. So fellow Entertainer voucher users- please take note.Even if we did get to utilise the Entertainer voucher, it would be our first and last visit to the restaurant

Wife and I came for brunch. Eggs Benedict Grande was superb but both of us didn't quite like the Buttermilk Pancakes.
Ambience was excellent. Definitely a place to chill and relax on a weekend.

quick to serve, attentive to our table and requests. wonderful meal we had there and highly recommended!

Poor customer service.
We have to remind waitress time and time for plain water and bill.
Plain water was still not served in the end.
Long waiting time for our food, beverage and bill

So far I've been here twice: once for brunch on my mother's birthday and another for dinner with my family. The brunch was a totally positive experience. My mother is rather picky but she loved the cafe latte and food. The waitress was super friendly and when she found out that it was my mother's birthday, gave my mother a choice of complimentary brownie or cheesecake! She successfully help me make my mother feel special.Having brunch at the Canopy is like having your meal in an airconditioned garden too. I like the glass walls that allows you to see the foliage in the park. The dinner experience was good but not as perfect. The staff was not as attentive. We were not told that the cauliflower dish we ordered was unavailable until we enquired about why it was taking so long to be served. However the quality of the food was good.

Operation manager completely saved our date at this establishment. The chef was unprepared to offer me a vegetarian alternative, to which I was very disappointed. I have visited hundreds of establishments and never had an issue getting a vegetarian meal. Here was the first time I was shocked to ask for bacon and sausage to be swapped, where the chef refused! I would like to forward my high praises to the manager for making the experience memorable. But the chef really needs to re-establish his team work and client pleasing attitude. It would have cost nothing to swap tomatoes for sausages

The water was not served without having to request for it twice. The three smoothies were very much iced n diluted and do not warrant such a high price tag of 14 when even boost can do much better. BlueBerry pancake with ice cream was overdone and tough, ice cream was 1/3 melted when it arrived. Mushrooms were badly done for both eggs benedict and mushroom omelette. Generally felt dissatisfied

If you are looking for somewhere to take the dogs for a walk on Sunday morning (or any day for that matter) and want to include a stop for a coffee or breakfast or brunch, then the Canopy at Bishan park is absolutely perfect. We had a relaxing Sunday brunch with our 2 dogs. the restaurant has an air conditioned indoor area and a really pleasant outdoor area that is pet friendly, with shade provided by tropical feeling bamboo and other leaves on the gazebo type roof lattice with fans for additional cooling if desired. The outdoor area extends further in to a cozy bar area that is also part of the restaurant. This is a really nice area nestled in the outdoor section if the restaurant to enjoy a quiet read and a drink or a chat with friends. We had the special Grande Eggs Benedict with fresh orange juice (that was beautiful - creamy freshly squeezed and served with ice in a large mug/jar) and a latte for me and cappuccino for her. Coffees arrived quickly and the eggs not long after that. The food was very good, not too much, just the right temperature and the poached eggs were just like they rave about on that TV show "Master Chef". The restaurant is really quite unique as it is in the middle of Bishan Park, a large beautiful park in the centre of Singapore. The roof is actually covered in plants and flowers and the whole area just blends in so well with the nature around it that it feels welcoming, eco-friendly and just somewhere you want to go in and see as it is so different and special. The kids will like ti too, the menu has children options and the make their own cakes and breads inside and for the big people, a wide range of beers and other refreshments available with their own wine cellar in the restaurant to choose from

Canopy has a nice ambiance and the staff are attentive and accommodating. The restaurant is dog friendly. Food was good. Service was a little slow but to be fair it was a pretty busy day and we didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive.
4
There are a lot of choices in terms of food and drinks for brunch in this restaurant. The ambiance is very nice and guests have the option to dine inside the restaurant or opt for the table outside. It is located in the middle of AMK-Bishan park. The service is very nice even though at times when it is really crowded, it would take some time for the food to be brought to your table even with the drinks. Overall, the place is really nice to dine in

We had breakfast at the Canopy and the food was great. They serve western breakfast and the price is mid-range. The retaurant is clean with a choice of indoor air conditioning or outdoor dining and is nicely set in the park with short walking distance from the car park. A good choice to pamper ourselves after a walk/jog at the park
4
Food was good esp crab aglio. Indian manager was attentive and showed great initiative. Superb service i must say. Attentive and there was the personal touch. Justified my dinner choice for the night.
4
Enjoyed the Baked Black Cod - the asparagus was of the right texture, with bite and not too soft. Cod in teriyaki sauce has a balanced taste. The lobster promodero was al dente and tomato base was tangy. Enjoyed the prompt service too.
5
Big portion of grilled breakfast though ex. Great atmosphere chatting with friends. Will come back again!
4
Upon arrival, was greeted in a friendly manner. Requests were handled in a professional & quick manner. The ambience is fantastic. Service staff very attentive throughout dinner. Food however was mediocre. That is something they need to look into, especially flavours.
4
Food was great with nice ambience. . The wine came a bit slow and i had to ask twice before it came. But overall experience was pleasant. We will definitely come again..
5
Though it's somewhere in the park, the atmosphere inside the restaurant was great and peaceful, food is good & valuable for money!
4
mains - fried chicken w tomato & cheese was delicious being the perfect combo. topped w yummy fries, crisp outside, soft inside. $19++mains - pan seared salmon is a healthy & pleasantly surprising dish w soup base full of veggies & mashed potato. $21++drinks - iced mocha coffee flavor pales in comparison to what other cafÃ©s can offer.
3
The food was great. All the mains that we ordered were delicious! However, service was average. The waiters did not bother to refill our water and we had to constantly ask them to do so even though the restaurant only had a few tables that was occupied. Most times they were just standing around. The ambience was good. Overall, I would go back again because of the food and the ambience, but service can definitely be improved
4
Had the rack of pork. Pork is a difficult meat to get right and Canopy has done it just right! It's remains a great place to meet, being situated in the very pleasant Bishan Park. The restaurant can get a bit noisy though. And its on the pricey side
4
The setting was lovely - luscious greenery, clean looks. The Yorkshire pork rack was very good, although a tad undersized. I would not order the ribeye again - although it was the most expensive on the menu ($34), it was quite ordinary in taste. The dessert - sticky date pudding - was out of this world. I would go back just for this.
5
Arriving late due to pouring rain and bad traffic, staff were still smiling to greet my party of 5. Cheerful, helpful and excellent services. Food is unique and delicious
5
Excellent customer service. Food is delicious too. Would be really nice if they can allow us to place my small dog on a stool or chair

GREAT DINING EXPERIENCE....
It was our first time to visit after its renovation. The ambience was great, fresh looking dining place. My friends and my wife is satisfied with all the food. We can't wait to dine here again. Keep it up.
2
Me and my wife reached the restaurant at 7 pm, and we finished at 9.15 pm...I mean, I don't mind having a slow and relaxing dinner, especially in the middle of Bishan Park (which is a nice place to be, I must say). But I think there are room for improvements on how they should manage the waiting time between serving the meals. I waited for an hour to get my main dish, in fact my wife has already finished hers when mine finally arrived. I almost snapped when the service staff asked me after 45 minutes "Did you ordered the fish, sir?". I think if they are uncertain of what I have ordered, they shouldn't wait for so long to clarify.To be honest, the beef wellington was nice, and the barramundi was nicely cooked. So the quality of the food was fine. But sometimes, the service really makes a difference. They did apologized to me at the end of the dinner, but perhaps I was just not impressed with the service quality

Had a little catch-up session at Canopy. Some of them have been here before and recommended going down.Ambience was amazing, it was very comfortable indoors and even during a dinner peak hour, it wasn't too rowdy or noisy. We loved it. Beautiful place to chill, like a Dempsey Hill in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park! Pet friendly in their outdoor setting.Food was delicious. Had the Baked Black Cod, and i would recommend it to my friends. Also ordered the Sakura Chicken, Aglio Olio, Carbonara and Truffle Fries; all equally amazing dishes with the exception of the fries.. we just felt that it was a tad bit more like normal fries.Other than that, we had a great time. We'll be back
4
This is a little gem in the center of Bishan Park. The eggs benedict is fantastic. Service was a little slower on a weekend but the waitress was so kind and helpful. It has a kids menu too. Will be returning again and have eaten here twice now
5
It was a very quiet Sunday evening where we had our dinner. Ambience was just right and the waiter was extremely polite. The Japanese platter and pork steak was extremely well done. Latte and hazelnut coffee was just right, not over the top nor too burnt. Price wise it's also pretty decent, particularly it being situated in a lovely Park setting. Definitely would recommend you a visit
1
I couldn't believe the food that I have tasted the first time and went back to validate the 2nd visit after 2 months.I was affirmed that it serves a rather bad quality of food. A few of the signature dishes didn't taste well either. Besides the ambience due to the location, there is nothing that worth a visit.I have to sent the beef back to the kitchen as it was tough and salty. Though they tried and apologised but I couldn't accept that a decent restaurant serves such quality of food. It is such a waste and I hope the owner understands where is the problem before it is too late.Well if you are just going for a beer or 2, by all means but if you are looking for food, Forget it. Not until they have changed their Chefs and Menu
4
If you are hunting for a place for meals and tea where it is family kids friendly or possibly business deals to be strike, look no further than the Canopy. Great food, attentive staff, superb ambience. The lush greens will calm your nerves and cool your blood pressure amidst the busyness of lives.
1
it rained during our visit and the restaurant didn't do anything and didn't even provide shelter for us to wait at. We were left to fend for ourselves and no alternatives were given to us.
4
Pleasantly situated in a park, with indoor and alfresco dining. We had the beef cheek, pork steak and carbonara - all were very good. The service was fast and friendly and it was reasonably good value.
4
Our regular place to have breakfast on weekends at bishan park. Place looks nice after renovation. Always ordered egg benedict and crab pasta, our favorite!! Outdoor eating place is pet friendly too.
3
Nice environment. Had the set lunch which was good value for money. However soup was cool by the time it was served.

My wife and I came to Canopy about a year ago after winning a voucher. We love the food and ambiance. Hence, we decided to have our Christmas Eve dinner here. It was a cooling evening and even thou I did not make an indoor reservation, the outdoor dining area was pretty cooling and the Christmas songs playing in the background and the decorations gave it a festive feel. The food was delicious. The only issue we had was that the man sitting behind my wife kept bad- mouthing his colleagues at the top of his voice. Being the season of caring and sharing, his loud screeching voice and his negative topics spoken in Chinese and Chinese Dialect spoilt the atmosphere. More than once, I had the thought if the restaurant staff should approach him to ask him to speak softly and not disturb the rest of us. I always have the feeling that restaurants in Singapore have not done enough to ensure that such guests do not disturb the other guests. I would have given 4 out of 5 for everything if not for this 1 man. But on a positive note, we would still come back to Canopy for occasions such as Valentines Day, our anniversary and days like these. Overall, we both like the place for the food and atmosphere
5
One of the best dining place in the park. Located in the north side of Singapore. Be close to nature, yes u will get some mosquito bite if u dine outdoor, so i suggest tt indoor is a better option. Comfy seats w aircon. But if u love nature soooo much like me, take the outdoor seats. Dining with fresh air and with plants around, u will definitely love the place a lot ! Not forgetting to take a slow walk in the park after ur meal, mcdonald is jus a distance away if u r missing ur mc flurry ice cream ! Oh ya, this resuturant welcomes pets ^
1
Ambience was good.Coffee was good.The rest is terrible! I went with group of friends and nobody like their food. It's THAT BAD.To add to the bad taste, the service was super slow.I will never come back again

The restaurant is nicely appointed and set in a very relaxing environment that is great for a dinner with close friends, or even a romantic date (as long as your date does not mind the occasional barking due to the proximity to dog areas). Made a reservation via Chope and getting seated was fuss free. The menu is extensive, with pizzas, pastas and mains like Beef Bourguignon and Yorkshire Pork Rack.For my group of 4 at dinner, we ordered 1 Sakura Chicken (friend's comment - delicious!), mushroom soup (did not ask for comment) and 3 Yorkshire Pork Racks.A minor disappointment happened right here with the pork racks. Only 1 was served and the other 2 were not looking like they were appearing, so we checked with the staff. The staff came back to us to say that the pork racks were 'on the way'. From there, we waited long enough for them to have cooked the pork racks from scratch so they definitely forgot the 2 other pork racks. Would have been great if the dishes were served together, but mistakes do happen. Would have loved if we were told that the dishes were missed out but understand that some customers may throw a fit right then and there if this was mentioned.When my pork rack finally came out, it was tender, and delicious. The lovely layer of fat was very scrumptious and the mashed potatoes were creamy and had me lapping up every last bit of it. The pork rack was easy to handle, and did I say it was delicious? However, I do have to bring up something less than ideal about the pork rack. I believe that they might have been rushing to serve the pork rack due to having forgotten it prior, so the meat was actually rather pink in the middle. I chose not to sent the food back to the kitchen and I do think this was an exception to the norm, so this should not discourage you from ordering the pork rack.All in, this was worth a visit and you should drop by. Just tell them to pay attention to the pork if you are squeamish about blood

Canopy has so much potential as a brunch spot, it was just a shame the food and coffee were cold by the time they got to us (we were sat right next to the barista and kitchen!)However had the food/coffee been warm, it would have been delicious. The atmosphere is good but they should have more staff to cope with customers
4
Had a fantastic get-together with 2 very good friends & our babies. Service was excellent.Will definitely return.  
5
I've been to Canopy before their renovation and back afterwards, the new wall windows and high ceiling really adds to the dining in the Park experience! Their food has always been consistent and delicious, I love their deserts (save some space for it!) Overrall its a great place for a date and for weekend brunches
4
The place is much spacious and comfortable after the renovation. More items may be added to the menu for a wider variety.
4
Give it a go if you haven't already. Not overwhelming in food portion size. Good prices. Quality drinks.
5
Customer service was good, food is good too. Beautiful place, perfect place if guys wanna impress their date. Afterwhich you can take a scroll at bishan park which is just outside though it can be a little stuffy at the park.

I receive total of 12 calls of confirmation even when i have confirmed my RSV,the automated calls keep coming when am already online the 1st time.

Nice experience! We use entertainer voucher one for one, 30 for two person with two dishes and drink. Very nice! Fast speed and good service!
4
Great place for Team gathering. Group of 15 people in open space in bar area. Happy hour and finger food is fantastic. Very relaxing ambient with big screen TV

Ate lunch here as a family with our dog after having visited the nearby Bishan dog run. Sat outside on the terrace where dogs are allowed, nice atmosphere and decor. Good easy music, not too loud.Had the brunch menu. Service was fine, efficient and reasonably prompt, but not overwhelmingly friendly.My daughter had the kids spaghetti bolognaise, which was excellent. Very tasty and fresh. She also had a glass of milk (a bit on the pricey side at 4sgd for a small glass)We had two of the egg dishes from the menu. My husband's poached egg on smoked salmon muffin was good, my poached eggs on artichoke hearts was less special, sour taste from the artichoke pieces (not a whole heart) and the vinegary hollandaise sauce. I would probably choose something else next time.Dog friendly generally, there is a nice shaded terrace where you can sit with your dog. One point of improvement - they do not provide dog water bowl
3
Had brunch with family here. Newly renovated outlook is refreshing and less cluttered. They have moved the bar area to the back rather than at the front. It's more spacious now. 1 thing.. They have to look into is the food/ingredients used. Not fantastic on the food. But what can you asked for when the price is so cheap... I'll only asked for freshness. Nothing else. Do look into having better coffee please?
4
The duck pizza was average. Atmosphere was a little ruined since they sat us down at beside a side door. There was a child that kept coming in and out. Additionally, that door is also used by the servers when they need to serve the food outside and it was rather disturbing. Besides that, the overall experience was good. The servers were extremely friendly :)

First I must compliment the manager, Simson, for being polite and professional. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about our experience at the restaurant.I reserved dinner for 3 at 7pm, when we arrived at 6:45pm, a staff, without asking for my name and reservation time brought us into the restaurant but left us standing in the middle of the restaurant for a while, while he went to figure out my reservation.I asked a question about a particular dish on the menu, the waiter said he doesn't know went to ask the manager over to explain. It's a small menu of main dish but the waiter does not seem to know much about what the restaurant was serving. We ordered our food and specifically told the waitress we are sharing. When our food came, the waitress who was serving us did not bring extra plates and we have to call her again to request for the plates.We ordered 2 clam chowder soup, Pork Rack, Ribeye Steak and a bowl of Broccoli. The clam chowder soup was a complete disappointment. It tasted like mushroom soup with tiny clams. the Pork Rack was tasty and was the only dish that night that we felt was ok. The biggest disappointment was the steak which I ordered for medium done, the steak came rare. The steak looked like the beef has just been taken out from the fridge and grilled for a short while, everything you expect from a $34 steak is not done properly. I felt a western food stall in a hawker center can do a better job than this restaurant. The manager was kind enough to accede to my request to cancel the steak and replace with a pizza.Overall, I think Canopy is good for some drinks and tappas but don't expect anything close to what a restaurant should offer in terms of food and service.Vincen

Service was bad and slow. Very different from previous visit (prior to renovation). Ordered ice mocha but it is still warm when serve. Have to ask for ice cube instead.
3
hope that the smoked duck pizza can be improved. However we love the warm goat salad and prawn paste wings still not bad
5
My friends had the cod which was fantastic, literally melted in the mouth. I ordered a medium rare steak which came almost medium done or well done. I asked for a change and the second steak was much closer to my preference.

I went there with my family for lunch over the weekend. As we walked from the calm and serene environment of bishan park into the restaurant, we were taken aback by the din that we were confronted with. The acoustics of this place may have amplified the noise in the room, and this made the dining experience an unpleasant one.The food was pretty bad in my opinion. Items on the menu that were recommended by the Chef disappointed my taste buds. The crab aglio olio had an odd flavour to it. The salmon dish lacked any flavour. The eggs Benedict were sub par. Overall, the food and the ambience were not worth the price. I would not recommend this place to anyone.  
4
The pizza I find it was relatively good, the lobster pomodoro and carbonara was below expected taste. We were expecting a better sensation. The ambience was a little noisy partially due to private event, staff are focusing on them hence when serving pasta they did not provide serviettes or spoons.  
2
My bad experience started right at the door. I waited to be seated, per the sign, but no one noticed us standing there for good few minutes. I had to walk up to them. Through my meal I noticed some staff chatting to some customers like old friends, while some others struggled to get their attention. Food might be good but the whole experience affected my appetite.
2
The ambiance and setting of Canopy are terrific but it is a shame that this is not matched by the food and beverage standards. We (four pax) had brunch and each meal was disappointing. Bland, under cooked and missing key ingredients were just some of the comments made by our party. The coffee was also ordinary with the flat white and latte being identical to the cappuccino. 
5
The restaurant is spaciousness located near Bishan Park and there is ample car park for drivers. Getting there to the restaurant as the transportation is high accessible there.The wait staff are generally polite, courteous and helpful to recommend n assist you in your food choice. Average is about $15-$23 for the main course and I will give a thumb up for the quality, presentation and portion of the food served. It has an alfresco setting just outside the restaurant and I really like the chillout ambience created at the bar counter for customers to catch up with friends over a drink or watch a game of soccer
3
Most of the staff don't really attend to the customers, be it those at the door, those sitting down on the table. Unless you call them out specifically, otherwise they will just ignore you even with eye contact. I think restaurants like this shouldn't charge service charge, unless they can provide a service.
4
We were impressed by the decor and I love ambience of the restaurant. feels like you're dining in greenhouse with the glass panels all around. I like the walk-in wine cellar that is in full view of the diners and boast a large selection of wines. The food was above average. We tried the eggs benedict and a crunchy toast with ice cream. Lovely flavours! The chef made his rounds and chatted politely with the diners, seeking their opinions on how his dishes fared. Good location with parking close by
