Went with a Work group for dinner. Food was authentic, mostly Balinese. Lush green environment. Service is absolutely fantastic! Housed in a nice bungalow, done up to offer a very nice ambience for dinner.

It's a nice little restaurant and the service is also good. Very interesting place, with the close down of wine co, this place becomes the only place at that area for good drinks and food.

Lovely and value for money. Very nice Colonial feel in the gardens. The Prime Rib is worth the dollars. Staff is friendly and unpretentious.

Just had a pre-Christmas celebration with my family and decided to try out on their Royale Prime Rib again. Ordered 2 portions, medium and medium rare!! One Wagyu DRump and a 4 course (Ribeye) to savour all their steak selection. The steaks were all done according to their requests, juicy and nice. Ordered a Prosecco and a Petit Verdot. Highly recommend to small families who enjoy nice meat and good wine

Went with a friend for a few beers in the bar at the NUSS club and was reminded of the "British Club" influence on the establishments of years gone by. Great drinks selection in the upstairs bar, especially the single malt whiskies, at extremely low prices (for Singapore) and delicious food served on the terrace (my friend and I shared a German style pork knuckle with grilled foie gras as a starter)I heard the place is closing soon so maybe it is worth a visit if you get the chanc

This place is open to both NUSS members and non-members (latter pay 10% more on the prices for absence of membership). Nonetheless, prices are reasonable for the quality served.Ambience Nice environment for couple dates or group gatherings. Indoors for those who need air-conditioning, and outdoors for those who enjoy being surrounded by greenery. Food and WineA good selection of western and Italian cuisine, and options fit nicely with your personal choice of wines or liquor. They do serve cocktails too, and non-alcoholic selections, as well as hot beverages. On food, I enjoyed the Lobster and Prawn bisque soup + Duck Confit which had a very nice skin crust yet the flesh of the duck was tender and not dry. For dessert... (which was one of the best I've come across) is the Cempedak CrÃ¨me Brulee (its a French dessert dish with Asian tropical fruit flavour)LocationUnless you have someone who knows the place and has a car, otherwise it can be quite frustrating. Even by taxi is not a sure-find because the location is very deeply set within the compounds...

We were lucky to be brought for dinner to this restaurants by local friends. What a wonderful restaurant. The food is very good, service is perfect and the setting is very good also. Our special dietary needs were taken care of and eveyone's dishes turned out to be tasty and well prepared. we recommend highly

On one of my free evenings, we met up with an old friend and his wife who brought us to Nuss Bukit Timah Guild House which is located in the campus of NUS. Surprisingly, the food was good. We ate al fresco and had a nice time chatting away while savoring the food. I had their ribs while my wife took the cod. The place was almost full and so we decided to have our dinner outside. That turned out to be the right choice. The weather was not that balmy and their was a slight breeze. Service was a bit slow and the orders trickled in one at a time. All in all, a nice choice to spend a pleasant evening

Love this place. If it is not raining, sit outside. No mozzies as they fumigate it quite well. on weekends, there is a two man band. Great music else listening to the crickets at night is awesome.Food quality is good too! And service is good. The price is reasobnable, so book in advance

The service may be a little slow but the menu is full of lovely dishes. Have never had a disappointing meal. A good place for a cosy conversation and if you don't mind the humidity, sitting outdoors is quite idyllic, but be prepared to be ignored by the service staff
