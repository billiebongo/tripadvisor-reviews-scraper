This branch of Billy bombers has closed down. Used to go there for family meals. Love the food. Love the music. My wife loves their chocolate smoothies!

This restaurant has very nice vintage deco and comfortable seats. Great for family and friends who want to celebrate any occasion. The teenagers love this place and the western food here is great.

i should give credit to this restaurant. The food is great especially the ribs and salad. Wedges were nice too! It was a few months ago when i visit this restaurant and i was starving! Portion of food is just nice for one but i ordered slight more dishes to share with my man. We were very full and price is around 60++, considered affordable.Staff were friendly and service is prompt. I'll definitely revisit
