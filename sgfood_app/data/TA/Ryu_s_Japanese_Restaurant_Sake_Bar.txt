I had a great dinner at Ryu’s japanese restaurant. It’s not overcrowded, the service and food were excellent!
4
Nice ambience. Ordered the steamed snapper set and it was a moderate fare. I particularly liked the jelly dessert.
4
Ordered the Christmas set that came in an afternoon tea-like setting. Good variety and almost everything was delicious!
4
Puffer fish was fresh and nice variety of ways of cooking the puffer fish. Skilled cook and should be safe as this is the second time I have dined here. Free flow of sake during happy hour was worth it for the price.

Every Omakase dishes come beautifully presented and quality of food is top notch. Mouth watering beef with very fresh sashimi. Wide sake selection and the staff there is always willing to share some sake knowledge if you ask. The service crew is attentive to us, making sure to serve the next dish when we are done without being intrusive. Had a real wonderful dinning experienc
3
Good points about this restaurant:- Sake selection at reasonable price and various tasting quantities - Friendly staff which is uncommon in Singapore Negative points:- Common food, nothing special while the quantity for the sashimi was far too little: no value for money- Environment/location not good: feeling like in the hall of a shopping mall with echoes, no windows and too little spaces. Not comfortable for dinner but ok maybe for a quick/cheap lunch

I had dinner for the first time at Ryu’s at Capitol Piazza. I did not know what to expect and I was indeed very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Ryu’s signature set for 2. Courses were served mostly delicately. Food tasted good and looked good as well. Sashimi was very fresh. Staff and chef were very friendly. I enjoyed the evening there.
4
The Christmas signature course was well presented. The portions might look small but it’s quite filling once you’ve completed it. The restaurant has a relatively quiet atmosphere and is good for dinner conversations. Staff were well-mannered and friendly. They have an assortment of sake for you to order as well. For 2 pax, it’ll probably be $150 and up. Might try the omakase course one day too.

Ryu's is opened by Chef Hiro who hails from a family of chefs and restaurateurs. A unusual items are the al dente Organic Thin Wheat Udon; and the Fuji water, literally from Mount Fuji, served as water and also used in the making of green tea and a dessert jelly. The chef taught me how to pair the Akami lean cut of Tuna with the fragrant Shiso flowers; I'd always thought they were just decor. I love the fluffy and piping-hot Hokkaido rice, delicious with the fall-off-the-bone tender Iberian pork ribs and a delicate Daikon stewed in a sweet miso sauce. Well paired with a flask of the clean tasting and rounded acidity of the limited autumn edition of Rumiko no Sake. The atmosphere is intimate; best to sit at the counter to interact with the chef
4
I like the ambient, very quiet n relax. Service really good. Staff very attentive, give good suggestion, and also generous to offer us complementary appertier n dessert though these items are for set that we didn’t order. Food is quality, love the stew pork, sweet potatoe tempura and the sashimi. Sake wide range of selection. Will like to come back for the Omakase set.
4
The food was of high quality (fresh meats) and I enjoyed my meal. The ambience was nice - you get a quiet corner to yourself. The service was excellent as well
4
This is not your run of the mill sushi bar. The sushi chef is an artist. If you are looking for typical rolls and standardize menu, this is probably not the place for you.
5
awesome, very nice place to visit. Staff are very observant. Bar seat is amazing as you can see the chef show his skills.
5
Service was fabulous, personal attention to details. Totally enjoyable experience there with great food!
3
Good wide selection, decent value for money sets. Slightly gimmicky presentation if you are into the little touches. Call out for the great service and sake recommedations! Look out for sake 'on tap', something I haven't heard of till his visit.
5
Been here a few times, each time a happy customer and extremely satisfied! The Chef, who speaks little english, is also extremely hospitable and always makes it a point to come by to say hello and welcome!My family love the superb braised pork dish as well as their fresh sashimi. Always wonderful.If with 2 or more diners, I would recommend their set for 2, plus something from their Tsukiji Market special menu. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do each time!

Was introduced by my son to Japanese Sushimi at this restaurant. We liked some of it, the whiter lighter fish but not too keen on the tuna. Apparently, the fish served in this restaurant is delivered fresh from the fish markets in Japan.It was obviously of high quality with a very high quality price. The service was adequate but not exceptional hence the loss of 1 rating abov

Stumbled across Ryu’s and after coming in with zero expectations we were genuinely surprised and happy with the food. Firstly the staff were excellent, we were warmly greeted and although the Restaurant looked busy we were quickly shown two seats at the bar. Although we only stopped off for a drink and a few snacks the quality of the food was very good. We ordered some grilled lamb and chicken which was juicy and not overly slathered in sauce so as to lose the flavour of the meat. The seafood tempura was cooked in a delicate batter that wasn’t too soft and had a little crunch to give the prawns a nice texture. We also ordered a side of fried chicken and I have to say the size of the portion was quite big. The chicken it self was cooked very well with the meat tender and juicy inside, although the batter could have been a little crispier. The meal came with a cold carrot soup covered in a miso paste, that was surprisingly tasty as the miso added ‘pops’ of flavour to the carrot soup whenever you bit into the flecks of paste. Overall the service and food was great, but the ambiance of the restaurant (tucked inside the Capitol Theatre auditorium) wasn’t great and the price was a little higher than I think it should have been. But overall not bad and I think we might try coming back to sample the sake and maybe some other dishes.

this was a very bad dining experience in this restaurant. we ordered the set , but all food is not good and the tap sake also so bad. just passed 9pm, they told us they closed and try to ask us leave. i definitely wont go there again
4
Unlike any other Japanese restaurants I've been to. Service is excellent, we all got a bowl of cold carrot soup to start off with along with warm towel. Ordered their signature box chirashi which you can even make your own sushi rolls with seaweed provided. They also offer variety of sets ard $128++ or more for 2 pax inclusive of premium green tea and dessert. Would say price range is on the high side, but you get quite a cool experience with fresh ingredients. Good for celebrating an occasion.
1
Ordered the one of the recommended set.. the stewed pork rib tastes like the opened can type and the fried fish meat is so hard is like eating chicken!. We pay about sgd100 per person for this!..
5
I visited the restaurant for Sunday lunch with my family and Boyfriend, in celebration of my birthday and I've got to say that the restaurant was really awesome! The food was fresh, awesome and interesting concept! Great customer service as well. Highly recommended!
3
Very small place, very comfortable, excellent service. Did the usual sushi (which was nice), sashimi tasting (also nice), tempura (I wasn't enthusiastic about). One feature of Ryu's is the sake tasting: you should definitely go for that. Ideal place for relaxing.
4
It's for a birthday celebration together as a couple. Very impressive atmosphere and ambience. Recommended for a romantic setting.
5
Did lunch at Ryu. Attentive service and good recommendations in terms of foo choices and sake pairing with food ordered.
5
We were looking for a new place to try and Ryu came highly recommended. It didn't disappoint. The food and service were impecable. The way the food was presented was thoughtful and the service staff took the effort to explain everything. Do not skip the sake, that was another highlight of the dinner. However, do not expect the prices to be low. This level of quality does not commensurate with cheap
3
Had their "Best of Ryu" lunch set for two last Thursday. The course included appetizers, tempura platter, Wagyu beef, Iberian pork ribs, fish and desserts. Except for the succulent and very tasty pork ribs the rest of the food was generally average. I must try some of their ala carte dishes before making a final rating of the restaurant but I must say I was impress by the quality of the service and I liked the ambiance of the place
2
My hubby and me went for lunch on 9th july. We had the Kaisendon set and Okamochi box set. Food was a disappointment. The sashimi slices were thin and small. They charge me $5 for green tea and $2 for warm water. Will not go back again. I do not think they can make it
4
First visit. Had their signature okamochi box - one drawer had mixed chopped sashimi on rice while the other grilled chicken pieces. Also tried their tempura which had unusual batter. Enjoyed the thin udon and the sale was refreshing. Overall nothing too fancy but great quality.
5
I have yet to come across sashimi in Singapore that is as fresh as this place. The open bar table concept also allows us to see the Japanese chef meticulously slicing sashimi and hand grinding the wasabi. They also gave us complimentary starter soups to try, and extra sashimi to go with what we ordered so we wouldn't miss out! The wait staff himself also spoke Japanese and so, after taking our orders, nothing was lost in translation when passing our orders on to the kitchen. I can't wait to come back! (
5
The chef made the effort to interact with guests. The staff provided personal and attentive service. Much appreciated.
The drinking place opposite should be moved outdoor by the landlord. Its patron's noise disturbed the otherwise tranquil setting at Ryu's.
3
The iberican pork is very tender & nice but the raddish that comes with it is very salty so much go with rice. Terrayaki chicken is normal, some of the skin was burnt not nicely cooked.
5
We loved the ambience and it reminded us of when we were in Japan. Service was great as well and the food was delicious and portions definitely enough. Highly recommend!
3
I can't really comment much since i'm a picky diner which don't take raw. But I must say the stew Iberian pork was super tender and tasty.
5
Food and service were great. Order the best of Ryu if you can't decide what to order. Portions may be small for some.
4
We decided to try out lunch at Ryu on Sat after reading some reviews. Ambience was nice & cozy. My hubby had the Okamochi Bara Chirashi-Sushi set ($45) that came in a nice wooden box with drawers. The top drawer had grilled chicken & soy sauce seaweed & salad. Bottom drawer was the chirashi. It also came with 2 sheet of seaweed where you can roll the chirashi into sushi. I had the steam boiled red snapper set (Nizakana set) ($25) which was very good too. There were also various other sets like the grilled chicken set & tendon set that look equally yummy! The sets all came with rice, miso soup pickles & dessert. The dessert was a very delightful mizu shingen mochi with caramel sauce. Overall we enjoyed our lunch experience & look forward to returning to try other dishes
4
The lberican pork very delicious and very tender but very small portion.The Udon also very nice my grandson 4yrs old like so much he can finish the whole bowl.Great Quality food but quite expensive.1 bowl of white rice $5.i will be coming back to this place i think i will try the signature set it look so nice.Service very good

Went for dinner at Ryu's, and we ordered the "Ryu's signature set for 2 pax" with an add-on of the Stewed Iberian Pork.We were, first, served the Tsunami Tree, which consisted of 8 mini appetisers that were beautifully crafted. However, we felt that one of the appetisers (some cheese-based item) was bad. It could be a biased view, as we are not great fans of cheese. But the other items were great.Second, we were then served the Tempura Moriawase. It is touted as the best-selling tempura platter. The prawns and vegetables felt fresh and was coated with a light batter. Just to note that, the tempura will leave some oil at your lips after almost every bite.Third, we were then served the Stewed Iberian Pork. This was definitely one of the best dishes of the evening. The meat was really tender and the flavour was just nice. Perfect dish! I will highly recommend this dish. Finally, we were served the star of the menu, which is the Okamochi Box. This three-drawers box contain (1) grilled chicken, (2) sashimi slices of various fishes, flown in from Tsukiji Market, together with sushi rice, roes, and marinated mushrooms, and (3) 2 seaweed sheets for you to make your own handroll. Importantly, the sashimi slices were fresh. However, we felt they could have provided additional seaweed sheets. One per pax wasn't enough. They also lacked the human touch, as none of them noticed that we were having difficulty dealing with the DIY handroll.Dessert was the raindrop cake, which tasted as it should be. Nice! If you want, you can have sake during your meal, or just enjoy the sake at their sake bar.On a whole, an OK experience, but if you really want a better Japanese experience (both in terms of food and service), there are better places to go to
5
The quality of the food was amazing especially the grilled Wagyu A5 beef. I loved how the chef took time to design the appearance of the dishes. Each was designed delicately.The Karaage chicken was quite a big portion yet juicy and I loved the Iberian Pork Kushiyaki.Definitely will be coming back to this place

We had a great dining night today at Ryu's. Having known Yukasan when I visited the sake bar in another afternoon, I was drawn first by the awesome service provided and the detailed explanation of the good food offered at the restaurant. I decided to come back for dinner along with friends. Without a clue on what to order and to really test the Chef, we decided to go Omakase with a medium bodied aged daiginjo. First course was dashi soup. Fragrant and light, I like the way it prepared the palate for the later courses. Next I had shellfish while my friends had marinated deep fried fish as appetiser. Next course for me was a generously coated pork ribs in a well reduced and slightly sweet sake sauce which was Super tender and fall apart at the touch of the fork. My friends had the tuna, bream and flounder sashimi. It's great to see Chef Hiro grating the fresh wasabi on the sharkskin. Next up was the A5 Miyazaki beef. Well cooked, melts in the mouth and the Accompanying veg were excellent. I loved the pumpkin and asparagus best. Then we were served chicken ball;pork and lamb skewers. The chicken ball n pork rock with my senses, but the lamb wasn't something I fancy too much. The texture is tough and taste of the lamb is slightly bland for my liking. The yuzu pepper however did lifted the taste a bit. And then cold Organic thin udon was served before ending off with Japanese melon and Mount Fuji water jelly. Nice touches. And all that for only $100! Very reasonable price in addition to Hirosan and Yukasan excellent service. Loved this place 
5
Every dish is excellently prepared. The menu is not the usual fare you would find in a typical Japanease restaurant.
5
Chanced upon this restaurant while shopping and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food served. The wagyu was amazing and our dessert from the set meal was great. It's on the expensive side but value for money for the quality of food served.
5
It's our 1st time to ryu's. The service staff is very attentive and gave us a brief of each item served.
The food presentation is creative and quality of food is fresh.
5
Dined here last night & chose the above set with an extra wagyu plus sake & green tea. All in spent about $240 for 2 pax.
Melanie, Mark & Patrick looked after us well & every item was described to us. Food was amazing.
3
Decided to try the set lunch here today. Just $15++ for a starter, some tempura udon and a small dessert. All quite tasty and friendly service. Might be worth another visit.
3
Interesting concept of food, with the chirashi served in a drawer-box. Felt that there was too little sashimi though. My box only had cubes of tuna and yellowtail, even though the menu indicated that there was supposed to be shrimp and scallop too. Not sure if this was because it was the chinese new year period and they had just reopened after the break. Would have appreciated if they informed us when we ordered, or at least offered to lower the price. Also, paid $2 for supposedly premium water when all we asked for was "warm water"
4
Had the set menu. The pork ribs was awesome. The Wagyu beef also very good. The tempura was very average. But overall good food at a reasonable price. Also on hand is a good sake selection. Service can be slow so plan accordingly. Surrounds are very nice so good to take an amble in the small piazza

In a city already oversaturated with Japanese restaurants, not all of them authentic, I was prepared to dismiss Ryu as just another "Japanese restaurant in the mall". I was just passing by. I wasn't even hungry, when I noticed the handwritten menu in Japanese listing seasonal items. This is always a good sign - either the owner is really nihonjin, or actually knows what the menu of a REAL Japanese restaurant is supposed to look and read like! The pleasant maitre-d' came out to greet me (so unusual in Singapore where most waiters are catatonic) and chatted amiably, asking me what I felt like. I said I wasn't that hungry, but I had to kill time before an event. She proceeded to suggest light samplings from their menu. Singapore service staff are usually awful, even at expensive fine dining restaurants. Impressed by her sensitivity, articulation and bilingualism (English/Japanese), I sat at the bar. I got some sushi and tempura wild mushrooms. The chef suggested a sake to my liking. I'm starting to feel like I'm really in Japan, not Singapore, just from the human interaction! All the other waiters were really super polished, quiet, and refined. Water from Mt Fuji was lovingly decanted in my glass and silently refilled every time. Everyone was informal, friendly, but competent. Yes, this is the way it should be! You should be respected, and the food, the water, and even the cups and plates should be respected. Learn, Singapore waiters, learn! I'm really sick and tired of hyper expensive restaurants in Singapore that - for all their investment in food, marketing and decor - completely fail to deliver on service and wait staff - that critical "last mile". My light meal was delicious and came with some unexpected, tiny add-ons (a creamy potage, a jelly with kinako and kuromitsu syrup). You know you're in a good place when not only do they have a good inventory of sake, but they also make sure to serve it in beautiful, postmodern-looking sake vessels and cups. Nothing is thoughtless here. I told the chef this was the best "user experience" I've had in Singapore for a long time in the fine dining scene and certainly plan to tell everyone to try it. As someone who is familiar with fancy watering holes in Japan, Ryu met all my expectations
5
I have always go to Ryu's for dinner - always their dinner set plus some a la carte. They never fail to amaze my taste bud every time. Sitting on the counter and seeing how my sashimi was being cut and slice with precision; that's the feeling of Japanese culture in essence. Everything was treated with utmost respect and care.Makes me appreciate my dinner even more and of course, speaking a little Japanese helps brighten everyone's evening. Definitely a go-to place for special date night, occasions, celebration. Kepp up the good work!
4
The layout is very nice.. the staff service is always with a smile.. the most important is the food. Fresh and delicious. Would recommend to anyone who likes Japanese food.. to try this place. Value for money.. I would come back again with the wife.. She enjoyed it as well. Booking in advance is recommended
5
The stew Iberian pork was tasty & super tender. The bone just slides out from the meat! The meal came with a cold appetiser soup which was flavourful and refreshing. The staff were also friendly and attentive 👍🏻
4
The restaurant is tuck in a private and quiet corner of the refurbished Capitol building. Food was fresh and well prepared. Everything was carefully thought thru and prepared with clear intention to bring out the best natural flavour of its ingredients.
5
Make your own maki roll is a must! Staff was attentive and excellent and I never knew green tea could be so good.
4
Very good food. Small portion and on the pricey end. What they lack in portion and definitely make it up with taste.
Many stars to their wagyu beef and ryu pork ribs.
5
Delicious seasonal foods. Best sake selection and pairing. Very nice and professional staffs. Reasonable price. What can I ask more?
4
I just celebrated my birthday here with my family and it was definitely something different from the usual dinners we had. The staff were on the ball and were ready to serve us at every juncture. The only issue i felt was that the raw fish was a tad bit too salty. Other than that, it was wonderful. The sake was on 1-for-1 offer so we enjoyed that really much
5
Ordered the set meal for our family of 5 so we could try various dishes. This was definitely a splurge meal as we were treating our parents who had flown in to Singapore. The quality of the ingredients is apparent in every dish. The meal started with a tasty fish stew followed by thin slices of wagyu beef dipped in a soya-pepper sauce. The tempura platter was remarkable for the lightness of the batter coating the shrimps and vegetables. The pork ribs in a sweet teriyaki sauce were melt-in-your mouth tender. The fried tofu and mushroom dish rounded out a really tasty meal. Would definitely go back for a special occasion or when important guests are in town.
3
Food: nothing to shout about, no doubt the ingredient is fresh Service: friendly staff, the chef is very nice and patience (he will try his very best to explain each dish with you in English, I like his smile *wink)Value: I think is abit over price ( we order 2 set meals - appetiser, meat, tempura, noodles/ 3 pieces of sushi, soup and dessert plus a glass of beer (they charged for warm water) = slightly below $220 with gst.Atmosphere: 2.5/
3
Visited the restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday and to try this new place. We went ala-carte as well as ordered from the sets. Asahi beer was reasonably priced at $8++.Located at Capitol Theatre, and easily accessible via City Hall MRT.Ordered the tendon set (@$25++) and it came with complimentary cold soup, some odd tasting pickles, a tiny cup of miso soup and small dessert. There were two large prawns, brinjal, squid, pumpkin, sweet potato and sea eel tempura in the tendon set. The ala-carte grilled chicken marinated in miso (@$12++) and Boiled Radish with Miso sauce and stewed Iberian Pork (@$17++) were actually rather nice. The portion of iberian pork was pretty generous.Ala-carte prices were reasonable as long as you know what to order
4
we tried the tempura and sakana nitsuke and stewed beef sets, they were all delicious. highlight was the bara chirashi, with 2 pieces of nori for you to try your hand at rolling your own sushi.Although Capitol Piazza seems more like a place for drinks than food, Ryu is a tasty and hearty option
4
A friend treated me to lunch for my birthday at the restaurant. I immediately noticed the great service, very helpful and attentive chef. The food was good and tea was exceptionally good.
5
There are many Japanese restaurants, but this place serves high quality hot sake. It's amazing how the flavor changes depending on the temperature. They own a Sake Izakaya in Kanda, Tokyo, and I would say that they provide the same quality for their warm-sake.
1
A complete disaster is what I would call our meal here. From the point when we sat down and staff were hanging around, behaving lost - we should have known then that we were in for a bad night. We had a big group, and we were told that they had insufficient menus to go around, so we had a grand total of 5 menus. No drink orders were taken as we waited for our other guests.Staff did not seem to know what to do, what to say or what their food was about. The food - firstly, let me state up front that we did not order their omakase menus - so perhaps the food there is a little better. We all had various items from their special sets. None of them were good, portions were tiny and we could easily have gotten better food from any regular Japanese food chain in SIngapore. Staff were not trained on how to place the dishes and things were being plonked on to the table haphazardly. In fact everything was haphazard- the food was being served slowly and irregularly , so we would get batches of food for some people while other people only started getting their food when the rest were done. Their ice Water, which was supposedly special, is chargeable at $2 per person, and no tap water can be served. That is their policy, which did not make this night any better.This is a very small restaurant and the nervousness and idle fidgeting of the staff can be felt very evidently and simply added to the bad night
4
Overall I was very pleased with the food and service here, just that the single wait staff required a bit of prompting to refill our tea. But the food was superb. We ordered a chirashi set and 2 tendon sets, and both met our expectations. The chirashi featured really fresh seafood cubes and grilled chicken, and it was fun making our own maki with the nori sheets provided. The tendon sets were also great with the tempura crispy, not greasy or oily. The sets also came with warabi mochi as dessert, which was very tasty but the portions were a bit too small.
5
I brought my partner to Ryu's for a birthday dinner surprise which the restaurant gladly helped to plan. Happy, satisfied and memorable experience for both of us! - easy booking on Chope- staff called in advance to confirm booking, introduce the menu and take any special orders- staff even took initiative to ask if I wanted to pre-order a birthday tiramisu dessert - the place was packed with regulars and Japanese the night we visited- cozy design with great relax ambience, located at a corner of the Capitol Piazza - staff arranged the best counter seats for us, right in front of the chef- we ordered the Omakase set and the Anko Nabe- we're no sake drinkers but we ordered the umeishu soda which was totally refreshing - though the dishes were served slower than expected, but the quality was top notch and worth the wait - display was exquisite, the sashimi was very fresh- much details and steps put into making the Anko Nabe - the miso is a special home-made one with blends of three different beans, a taste you find nowhere else- at the end of all the courses, the rice was put into the special miso soup, it absorbed all the essence and instantly became a simple but delightful and delicious dish which we slurped down in minutes - chef made several friendly attempts to explain to us the food we had even though he is not fluent in English. The staff were also ready to translate and explain to us- may seem pricey especially for those who are not familiar with Omakase dining, but I'd still strongly recommend Ryu's- certainly worth it for the special occasion - everyone else seated around us were also full of praises for the authentic food served - will definitely return to try the Okamochi box, unique only to Ryu's
5
Visited ryu's Japanese restaurant at Capitol plazza with my Wife for a pre Valentine's Day dinner. We opted for the anko nabe ($120 per set including appetiser, three miso base, angler fish - aspeciality winter dish of the Ibaraki prefecture, fish liver, Japanese vegetables , rice made into Zosui with remaining soup base and dessert). We also order an ala carte tempura as my Wife mentioned that one of their Chef used to work with a famous tempura restaurant in Japan. The food didn't disappoint, the tempura was crisp but not too heavy on the batter. The steamboat 3 miso base soup is amazingly tasty and the angler fish(with chewy collagen like texture) and the fish liver are equally good. The steamboat was prepared fresh by the Japanese Chef right in front of us and the servings (4 rounds) was served to us by the Chef. Though the service is rather slow but we can understand as there are many regular customers and we can see that the Chef is preparing the food with his heart and each dish out of his Chef table is a work of art. The service staffs are polite, attentive without intruding diners privacy. We didn't try the Valentine day set which comprise of the beautifully arranged okamochi box as my Wife is not able to take sashimi temporarily. But we are very sure that we will be back for more!The bill came up to around $190 for two of us including my large Kirin beer. We were both full and happy when we left the restaurant.

We came here for dinner on a weekday and ordered the "Power" course. The food was average at best, but average is really not going to cut it at the kind of prices this restaurant is charging. To be clear, its not just that the taste was average but the dishes they served were boring as well. Service was also an issue. Its not that the staff were rude or anything like that; they were just not well trained. Half the time they didn't know what they were supposed to do or who was supposed to do it. In addition, the timing of the dishes were very sporadic, some dishes took too long and some came too fast. There are many better choices for Japanese food at this price range in Singapore

This is a visit once only Japanese restaurant. Ignore all the so-called professional food bloggers who highly recommend this joint. My partner and I visited this restaurant on the recommendation of a famous Singapore blogger and ordered the omakase menu which the blogger nicely negotiated with Ryus. All I can say is: IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE DISASTER.The food presentation was decent but nothing to mention. The sashimi which the restaurant claims comes fresh from Tsukiji Market was such a huge disappointment = it was warm and in my personal opinion - nothing close to being fresh. All the different types of fish were stored in a single wooden box which was kept outside in the open for quite a long period of time (meaning more than 20 minutes) and by the time the fish got into my mouth, it was warm and distasteful. The chef didn't even bother to close the box and there were 2 food flies circling above the fish. Sigh.This restaurant is highly recommended because it serves monkfish/sea devil - Anko Nabe. We were served this "speciality" as part of the omakase menu and I must say I've never consumed fish cooked so bad. The sauce/seasoning was TASTELESS and the fish was just fish. The texture was chunky but you can't taste nothing. The only little taste I managed to get was bitterness in some parts of the fish. My partner and I had less than a small bowl each of the Anko Nabe and wasted the rest of it. TERRIBLE.This restaurant is NOT worth a try. We paid $125 nett per pax and had little value. Don't waste your time
4
Though the prices aren't exactly friendly to the wallet, it is a great place to indulge oneself if you are into Japanese food! I love the presentation of the food that we ordered; could tell that the chef takes a lot of pride in his culinary skills. Ask to sit at the counter as it is such an enjoyable time just watching what you will be served in preparation

My friend and I were sauntering leisurely on the ground floor, Capitol Piazza when we chanced upon Ryu’s Restaurant (20 Nov 15) and started a friendly conversation with the female staff stationed at the restaurant entrance. As the Kanji name Ryu (Willow) conjured up for us a breezy countryside landscape, we decided to try out the food. We were glad there wasn’t any big lunchtime-crowd then.We ordered the Ten-Don and the Red Snapper-Nitsuke Sets (both nicely-priced); each set was accompanied by a potato broth-soup and two other pickles (Japanese-style) - all colourfully and artistically prepared and tastefully presented on the tray. We noted that the chefs behind the counter were neatly and professionally apparelled; and all had their hair tied in a pony-tail (like a ninja): very interesting, veritably something unusual. The food really tasted good; and the ever-sociable staff were able to share with us the uses and intricacies of the Japanese utensils and cutlery placed at the bar-counter, when we asked. Very enlightening for us indeed!We thought the food portions were just sufficient for lunch; however, most of the menu items appeared to be rather high-priced generally. I suppose to some diners, it would be attractive pricing, for the great taste, elaborateness and authenticity of the food.However, the restaurant setting, layout and decor was truly very Japanese; generally, it was a very pleasant and relaxing ambience and atmosphere over-all. The wall artworks including a hanging kimono provided a good back-drop for patrons who might wish to take pictures inside.Although the place (not to be confused with its namesake ‘Dragon’ located at Orchard Road) was also known for its wide variety of sake in-store, we did not venture to try any, as we were not able to appreciate it.Conclusion: A cosy casual place to relax and enjoy some authentic Japanese dishes
