Went there on 19th December for the Breakfast and this place reminds me of visiting any caf'e in italy .
4
It was surprising to find a reasonably priced coffee shop in this impressive hotel. The young lady serving us was in training but was most helpful.
4
Came in for coffee in the morning. Although the queue was long but the service was quite fast. They had my coffee order perfect, exactly as I wanted it and done the right way (the espresso was pulled at the right time and temperature).
5
Whenever you are in Singapore and want to treat you with delicious sweets go to the Sweet Spot. Nothing will beat their world class pastries and cakes.
4
At 7pm they all the pastries are buy 1 free 1. They have a good cinnamon roll and itâ€™s only cost u $2.
4
If staying at MBS this is a great spot to pick up a coffee, light breakfast or done delicious cakes.
It's casual but just needs to be twice the size considering the number of people here during peak times.
5
Excellent way to start the day! Coffee is great. They will make changes to the menu on request, little extra pay for the effort. Fresh fruits and juices. What more would you like to start the day?
5
Coffee, smoothies & fresh baked sweets. We have been here numerous times & the service & quality are always consisten
5
We stopped here for coffee and cake after a tour of the building. What a treasure it was. The coffee was great but the cakes and biscuits were even better. I wish I could have eaten more. If you have a sweet tooth and find yourself in Singapore this place is well worth a visit
5
A perfect little place for a quick coffee and a huge selection of sweets and breads to compliment. Baristas are friendly and patient with those having trouble deciding. I found it amusing that the baristas were a bit shocked that I just wanted my coffee black. I have visited MBS twice and always find myself stopping in to the SweetSpo
5
We went there for coffe and a snack. Loved it so much we bought some more to take to the room to enjoy with a champagne. Great range of cakes and pastries. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Quick service. Most affordable food in the hotel. They have great almond pastry, egg salad sandwich, chai latte, pizza and banana muffin.
4
This is a good spot to stop for a coffee and pastry on the way out for the day. Limited seating. The pastries and desserts were good and they offer smoothies, as well as espresso coffees.
5
First place I visit every time I'm in Singapore.
Lovely cakes, good juices, tasty macaroons, rich sandwiches and very friendly service.
5
It was the only place we brought food at when we stayed at the Hotel. Its expensive but we just brought a few pastries for lunch and shared. It was busy and they had run out of a few of the cakes but were told a top up was on the way. Small store with a few seats otherwise it caters for more grab and go. Worth a stop to have a look at the pretty cakes
4
This place is in the lobby of Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, just after you walk in the front door to that Tower. It has sandwiches, coffee/tea drinks and of course sweets.Lots of tempting choices. I went for macaroons which were great. Not overly priced, good fast friendly service even in spite of how busy it is
5
Um, hello! Who wouldn't be happy with a great cup of coffee or flavourful latte? We're typically Starbucks people but I gotta say I've become quite additicted to their frothy latte's (truthfully there is going to be some serious withdrawal when we go home). SweetSpot is found convieniently across from tower three elevators at Marina Bay Sands. One of our favourite treats here in Singpore has been Macaroons, the selection at SweetSpot is excellent! And in 5 days of being here we have not had a single grumpy staff member, they have been so pleasant probably guilty of contributing to the addiction. If you are at Marina Bay Sands it is a perfect stop for your caffeine & sweets
4
Went to the outlet after 9am on the second day told by the staff that the chef will make the sandwiches at 9am, and there already small crowd ordering their breakfast or morning coffee. Ordered two turkey sandwiches and two cappuccinos. The sandwiches had many suprises once you bite on it. The cappuccino is not bad.The third day, went there before 9am to order blueberry scones, croissant with butter and two cappuccinos. It is not bad as well
3
Good range of pastries, cakes and macaroons. Find the cakes too sweet for my liking. Price is what you would expect of a hotel bakery. Usually grab a breakfast takeaway when I am in the bayfront area. Love the ham and cheese croissant especially if it's heated up. A bit disappointed that they seem to use Bon Cafe coffee beans for their coffee. Would have been a better experience if they choose one of the many locally roasted coffees from ththe independent cafes like those from Nylon, Papa Paletha, Common man coffee roasters amongst others
4
Found this place in the lobby of Marina bay sands hotel and it stood out as the display of sandwiches, macaroons and cakes etc looked so appetising. I got a the away but there us seating. It was really busy which proves its popularity . I had the Matcha Ind cake which tasted great 
4
Great shop for a quick breakfast or a coffee while staying or exploring the marina bay sands! Friendly staff and you can charge the bill to your room so no need to bring cash!
5
SweetSpot is ideal for a quick breakfast as well as for afternoon high tea; as also for anytime snacking. The preparations are delicious.
4
If travelling from NZ or OZ order a large Latte in a small cup for a coffee with a decent taste. Service was always good.
5
Rather than eating with the masses at breakfast in Marina Bay Sands pop in here for some tasty toast and coffee. Lovely fresh juice and tasty looking pasteries.
4
Probably the only place to get a good cup of coffee and a pastry in the lobby of the hotel. The coffee was good, and the pastries were tasty.
5
DO NOT MISS THIS, you will not be disappointed. So much to choose from, so little time. Excellent desert menu, cakes, macaroons and chocolates, They also have oven artisan breads and pastries. As well as excellent coffee and tea!
5
I was Starving so ordered a Mixed berry Smoothie a Special Green smoothie & an Almond crossiant; they were Amazingggg. The Staff are very Friendly, Helpful & Kind
4
The selection of cakes and pastries is very good. There is small area for dining there, but you can take away as well. We had a nice strawberry pastry that we took with us and it was very tasty. There are also choices of some sandwiches, but the best is the pastries. Located on the lobby floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and easy to find. Worth the visit for a nice coffee and pastry to take a rest before going to the Gardens by the Bay or on your way to the MRT station
5
I stayed in Marina Bay and usually don't really eat much in the morning. Everyday I had their fresh orange juice and coffee, sometimes with a pastry, such as savory croissant or muffin. They have a really nice bakery, interesting choices of beverage and a stylish decor. Was amazed with their chocolate eggs decoration during Easter time. Highly recommended for a quick bite or light breakfasts.
5
SweetSpot is located in the foyer of The Marina Bay Sands Hotel near Tower 3. It provides a huge range of delictable sweets as the name suggests. In addition it does crossaints both savoury and sweet. It also does great coffee. They also do great sandwiches. All of the offerings are at a very reasonable price. It is therefore suitable for a light breakfast or lunch or for simple indulgance! The fruit drinks are also great
4
This dessert and coffee place located on the ground floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is great. The desserts and coffees are a real treat and the service is great.
5
Great service, excellent coffee and sweets. Good value for what is here. If you just feel like a sandwich or cake this is the best.
5
Good place to get coffee & a cake to have with the coffee. Make a great turkey sandwich & selection of cakes makes choices hard
3
Bit busy place near to the Tower 3 path of the Marina Bay Sands. Coffee was great, but the cakes were bit overpriced.
5
After wearing out our feet, and needing a proper Italian style coffee fix here we are. The biggest surprise is not the coffee or wifi BUT the affordable pastries. The aroma of these pastries and taste are incredible!
5
All we want for breakfast is coffee and pain au chocolat so this suited us very well, rather than paying 28 S$ each for breakfast in the MBS. Service was quick. Prices were reasonable.
4
Good coffee and open early this little place is handy, efficient and reasonable value for money. No sandwiches until 9 am. Not even at 5 to 9.
4
Craving for sweet stuff, here's the place. From mousse cake to rich chocolate flavours to a basic cream slice, all within reach and u be spoilt for choice while standing at the counter.
4
Coffee! Enough said for those who understand coffee! It Ivan be difficult to find and the cakes are great too
4
The cakes and pastries available here are divine and reasonably priced to have with your coffee and the choices are endless. The service could be improved as all sales must go through a centralised spot even though you are originally served by another attendant - found this a bit bizarre and a little slow. Also the stools are really uncomfortable and we quickly moved onto the Rise Lounge which was way better
5
Holy ****, the pastrami sandwich at this place is seriously the best sandwich I have ever had. If you have the chance go and get it, it is insanely tasty.
5
The pastries here were very fresh and delicious! The staff were very friendly and efficient too. Great place for coffee and a snack.
5
There is a good selection of cakes and sweets, We had a flourless cake and it was really nice. I also had a latte and it was at a good standard.
4
Came for breakfast while staying at MBS
Very inviting staff. Pastry was amazing i had the 3 cheese roll and raspberry danish. Coffee was good
5
This pastry and coffee shop in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was fabulous. We are almond croissants both mornings with cappuccinos. The cost was very reasonable! The shop offers a variety of pastries and beverages throughout the day. All are high quality.
5
I have a good time eating lunch even this small space around the Tower 3 of marina Bay Sands Hotel. SweetSpot is literally designed as a grab and go counter but still accommodating a dine-in customer as we experienced. The staff from floor personnel to supervisors and manager are very friendly and hospitable. Sandwiches/breads and coffee are unique and with originality
5
I love the bread and cakes here! Place are small but lots to things to offer! And thank you Erdy for doing a great service and best coffee! Highly recommended! Best place to do breakfast! Both hotel side and convention center side! Sure will back again
5
Located in the shoppes marina sands mall in front of the ce la vi lounge ground desk, it's this great bakery where you can buy delicious sweets in a nice prices.There was promotion 1 on 1 so we had a great time half way to eat dinner
3
Several things about this place are a bit offputting. First, it's in Marina Bay Sands so you do expect it to be a little bit luxe. If that's what you're thinking, then you're in for a disappointment.There are no proper chairs here - mostly just stools. And high tables. And they serve food on plastic plates and forks. Considering how the prices are not really cheap, you do expect proper flatware (if not silver) and china.The desserts that I tried were no big deal. I ordered a chocolate cake (forgot what it's called but it was highly recommended by the server who was very impatient with his replies as to which cakes are considered the best) and some chocolate pieces (at 3 dollars a piece, you do expect them to be special) but all were just average. Not bad - just average.Well, to be fair to the aforementioned server, maybe he was tired. And that's another story: I noticed that they can get quite packed and when that happens, there is no system for dealing with orders. It's pretty random so you may actually end up a bit peeved if you are first to arrive at the display counter expecting to be attended to first and someone else who arrives later gets helped ahead of you, which actually happened to me. But again, I blame it on a lack of system. They are a bit disorganised.Later, the server tried to make up for what happened to me by apologising and making small talk. It was a valiant effort on his part and I do appreciate the gesture on hindsight but at that moment I was just feeling irritated with the whole set up.I'm not totally giving up on this place though. I'll try one last dessert just to check if there really is something special in this place
4
For those staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, this might be a really good option for breakfast. Instead of paying 40/50SGD for breakfast buffets and menus that some other restaurants at the hotel have, you can have a much cheaper one - and still delicious! It's right in front of the elevators of Tower 3, but it's pretty close to the other towers as well.The croissants are good, as well as the coffee. They also have fresh fruit, juices, muesli, yogurt, and a big variety of pastries. From 9:30am they also make sandwiches
5
Great open cafÃ© within the reception hall of Marina Bay Sands. Great for a coffee and a delicious piece of cake or a biscuit. Staff was extremely polite and helpful!
5
If you want to buy any birthday cake, I will strongly recommend you to purchase their Signature Chocolate Cake!
5
the perfect hidden place in the city. The place is pretty much medium size, the interior is perfectly classic and the taste of the dessert is amazing, kinda plate-licking lol.
5
I went there 3 time sin 2 days, that should be enough! Everything is outstanding, from the service to the drinks to the cakes, just outstanding!
4
Visited SweetSpot with my family & everything looks so tantalising! Service quick & efficient with tasty food. Wayne, the gentleman who served us, remembered our order & names the following day! Would recommend SweetSpot!
4
We had joined Sands Rewards Lifestyle Club as we were staying in the MBS Hotel, this entitled us to complimentary coffee at SweetSpot. Must say the coffee was nice but the buns, croissants and danish were delicious. You might say we had a wonderful breakfast.
4
Stopped by a number of times for desert following dinner or afternoon tea. Great selection and the cakes were delicious!
4
I had a lovely afternoon cake here, Fresh and tasty, although my Tea was served in a paper cup which does nothing for the flavour. For the price you would think that eat in customers would have china cups.
4
We stayed at the MBS for a few days and kept coming back to this spot for their delicious pastries, juices and cakes. Simply superb! I especially love their freshly squeezed orange juice, so refreshing in the morning. Highly recommended. Will definitely come back here again
4
I just stopped here for a quick sandwich. The service was great, friendly and polite. The food range is amazing, but I just had a sandwich which was plentiful, tasty and did not fall apart when y tried to eat it. Very pleasant cafe type establishment in Marina bay sands, and very affordable
4
Love their pastries especially the berries tarts/cake. chocolate is great too with a cup of nice cofffee.
4
The chocolates are pricey but well made. (S$3 each) Good flavours (we had raspberry and dark chocolate and hazelnut and milk chocolate). Good for a final sweet treat before bed as they're open until 10pm.
5
Fantastic range of of quick bites and beverages.
Staff is always friendly and welcoming.
A "must visit" outlet if you are visiting MBS.
5
This is a very good place with excellent food and prices were very good . Great place for a quick lunch before exploring more
4
Want a special treat, good variety of sweet cakes,chocolate treats, muffins, coffee and cold drinks. Sandwiches can be ordered with large amount of fillings. Eat in or takeaway. Found inside foyer of Marina Bay Sands hotel.
5
This small cafe just opposites to the Tower 3 lift lobby, the quality of food & service is the best place to my morning escape & refresh, must try their home made sandwich plus a cup of coffeeðŸ˜€
3
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights and 4 days in Tower 3, so just outside our elevator was the SweetSpot store. We came here every morning for coffee (approx $4.50-5 for a small) and an egg tart ($2.00 for one) as it was the closest and only place nearby for something quick. At night time after 7pm they had promotions for 2 for 1 on the egg tart so I believe it might be for most pastries as they try to get rid of it before close.We also got our evening fresh squeezed juices ($7.00 Canadian) and my chai tea latte (small for $7.00 Canadian). I've never paid that much for a latte before but then again, we're staying at the Marina Bay Sands for $550 Canadian a night so what should I really expect? They have lots of pastries here such as macaroons, cakes, cupcakes, croissants, etc. We only really went here because it was convenient but you won't see "Singapore" foods by going here if your looking for anything cultural.
4
In lobby of tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and easy to find. Simple alternative to expensive breakfast if all you need is coffee or tea and maybe a pastry (in morning) or a sandwich (at lunch time). Not much seating, but nicely decorated, service is fast, and prices are reasonable for the area
5
We got most of our coffee here. Tasted great everytime. We tried some of the beautiful sweets and breads and enjoyed all of them. Great place to grab and go, seating is limited. Fairly good value for money as well. Great for a light breakfast or snack. Good quality food and coffe
4
You have to get up early to beat the crowds of Asian guests who buy a tea and pastry for breakfast as they can not afford the hotels breakfast. By 9am the place is swamped and could be at least 100% larger. But the coffee is great, lots of pastry on offer and at good prices compared to the rest of the hotel complex.
5
This place is amazing, we got the American cheesecake, snickers cake, & chocolate croissant. Such a nice afternoon treat.
5
Every morning we had coffee, croissant, sandwich , and cake.
All delicious bakery and pastries.
The soy latte is delicious .
5
We had the New York cheesecake, some macaroons, some type of coffee cake and a cookie. All were spectacular.
5
Stayed in tower 3 for one night and couldn't resist when passing by. The lovely lady from the service made our experience even better. We loved the cakes she helped us to choose. Great service, thank you!
4
Had gone to visit the Marina Bay Sands hotel and found this corner of unadulterated luxury. My wife went to heaven and back! Expensive but worth a visit.
5
Great place to grab a quick bite, coffee, dessert. Also great to grab and walk outside to the marina bay park and gardens for a picnic.
5
This place is for snacks and sandwiches...and is very reasonably priced...and delivery very fast as well....great chocolates!
5
The family had a great and delicious breakfast !! Had the almond croissant, lemon scone, blue berry muffin, cheese buns, blue cheese buns.. yummy
5
Great service and great food the cakes were excellent and the Croque-croissant
outstanding, the best in Singapore and world class level.
There is a great selection of high quality juices I had the pear one it was outstanding.
5
We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and it was perfect for breakfast/snacks on the go or take to our room. We had bagels for brunch and pastries in the morning and afternoon and they were sublime. The staff were so kind and always accommodating to my husbands fussy requests. The coffee was also pretty damn good too! This was a regular stop during our stay at the Marina Bay Sands (probably why the staff remembered us too!) but would definitely recommend to others
5
The sweets, the sandwiches, the beverages, juice & bonafide American coffee with cream, Americanos..heaven. Open from early until 10pm. If you are staying @ Marina Bay Sands this is a no brainer for those on the run.
4
Fast , friendly service and easy to find in the lobby of Tower 3 . I think it is the only "grab and go" at Marina Bay Sands.
5
Excellent and great taste, love the bread and cakes and most pastries . Especially the blueberry muffin
5
Delicious, delightful, delectable, mark the Sweetspot as your destination detour, the best place to Stop. The aroma of the coffee, the tantalising treats, this is your best place to do a meet and greet.
4
For all the chocolate lovers - you must try the Chocolate Paradigm. It's one of the best treat I've ever tasted. It melts in your mouth and will give you that "feel good" experience.
4
Amazing desserts. The only downside is that very few sitting spaces so we had to wait quite long for space to free and be able to sit and it our dessert there.
5
Always treat my self to their coffee and pastries when I am there. Pastries are always freshly made and coffee is actually decent. Staff are friendly and it's always nice that they remember your name when you go back in.
4
Not the place for long elegant dinning, grab what you want and wander over to the gardens by the bay and enjoy. Great range of dessert and small range of savory.
5
had awesome display and variety of very naughty desserts and nice sandwhiches the staff were very friendly and it was no trouble to get it organised in take away dish to take back to room open quite late as well just in case you have late sweet craving
5
Love this place and the prices are surprisingly affordable. Great place to grab a quick bite or to take back to the room or eat at the waterfront. Very convenient and the customer service is very good with a smile keep up the great work
5
love their croissants,.so buttery,flaky and simply define.. excellent service, staff are so friendly and nice. warm and ,cozy ambience
5
I love the cakes and drinks here. The price also offers great value for money. Lovely staff and would definitely recommend!

Multi purpose cafe located at the MBS Convention Centre. We had Beers here about 6pm after a long first day at our conference at the beginning of March. A little surprised it was open but beers were welcomed. Not great surroundings, open and sparse.
5
The best place I have found for breakfast in Singapore. I have enjoyed a salmon wrap, a raspberry tart and a cream slice. The staff is friendly and the food is really good. The coffee is ok. Nice atmosphere and good value for money.
4
it is a good place it sit for a small snack or so the coffee is nice as well the small snacks they have so if you hungry and do not have much time it is nice place to go.
4
For me, a skinny vanilla latte and a gorgeous fresh pastry from the Sweet Spot was more than enough to se me up until an evening meal. A great alternative to a big sit-down breakfast. I've visited this location over the past three years and the staff are unfailingly friendly and professional
4
if your accomodation in MBS does not come with meals then this is the spot for you. This bakery/coffee bar has all what my heart desires good bread and very good cup of cappuccino. We frequented this spot every day during our Singapore Swing and i will very much miss this spot until we meet again
4
SweetSpot is an outlet inside Marina Bay Sands. Highly recommended to those who do not have inclusive breakfast with the room rate or to the walk-ins who would like to have an simple light breakfast.LOCATIONEasy access from tower 3 MBS.MENUSweetSpot offers a large selection of pastry, bread, cakes and coffee.According to my wife the coffee has a strong and consistent aroma, they are using BoncafÃƒÂ©, a local supplier who lately has been merged with Segafredo. Soft drinks, mineral waters, fresh juices are also available on the counter.From later morning onward a small selection of sandwiches is available.SERVICEStaff is very kind and generally professional. In our case Jerry, one bartender, returned 20 cents because he overcharged us with 1 marmalade. Honest since we did not realize it and already paid the bill.ENVIRONMENTI do not like the environment of SweetSpot. Only 3 high tables plus a bar with 4 stools. Definitely too less for the number of clients. If you are planing to consume your meal at SweetSpot, be prepare to eat standing.PRICEReasonable price. Value for money there even if most of the equipment is mono-use, from coffee paper-cups to plastic plates to wooden stirrer. Not really environmental friendly as not high style for the price paid
4
We stopped by SweetSpot for morning tea just before we checked out of Marina Bay. Everything inside the counter looked amazing - it was very hard to choose what we wanted!My sister and I had a coffee, a green tea (which came in a take away cup), a salted caramel tart and a New York cheesecake. It's a touch on the pricey side ($9) for each cake/ sweet, but they tasted delicious, had incredibly fresh fruit, and were delicate pretty pieces!! Be warmed, there isn't a lot of seating inside, but if need be you can always take your food/ drinks upstairs to your hotel room at Marina! Well worth the visit
4
We ordered drinks only - root beer for hubby which he loved and chai latte tea for me which I found interesting. I'm used to Starbucks' and coffee bean's chai so at first I thought sweetspots' chai was bland but after a few sips I liked it too because it tastes more organic as if you can taste the herbs unlike the commercialized ones with lots of sugar. The cafe is in MBS so it's a bit crowded when there are a lot of people in MBS. Also, the chairs are all bar stools so not very comfortable to stay in for long periods of time.
4
Pricey for coffee & sweets but not that unexpected as it's in the Marina Bay Sands lobby. That being said it was delicious & the staff were super friendly. There's not much seating so be prepared to share a table with strangers.
4
My husband and I needed a pick-me-up while walking around Singapore, and this hit the spot. Great iced lattes!
5
Popped in for a quick breakfast while going around Singapore. Was not disappointed. The iced mocha was incredible and the raspberry danish did not disappoint. Great little atmosphere for a quick bite and chat. Definitely will return.
3
Bland food. Poor choices. Expensive. Better option than the hotel Buffett though. $43 for four to eat breakfast. $48 each at buffet.
3
The place was convenient and offered simple breakfast items at a much better price than the hotel buffet.
4
Good choice of buns, sandwiches and drinks but quite expensive compared to UK prices. Try the lychee Danish and the tomato rolls. The cheese roll was too sweet
5
I must have gotten exhausted swimming in the pool and walking thorough the shops, but I really worked up an appetite and craved something sweet. It was very convenient in the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and I got it boxed and took it to my room. I never dreamed that I could get handmade chocolate delights, let alone one named after the Snickers Bar. My oh my was it good...to the last bite. My husband had the fresh berry cheesecake which was light but delicioso
4
The outlet serves good food and drinks, and it's a very good alternative (the only, actually) to the MBS' super-expensive breakfast. The only issue of SweetSpot is that there are not many places to sit and in the morning, for breakfast (obviously), it's quite crowded. Plus, there are only high chairs (like bar stools), so if you have young children, it's not the perfect option.If the outlet added more tables and real chairs, it would become perfect
5
Maybe we have been lucky but we felt the coffee was excellent. As well as the pastries, tried the almond croissant, mielle fieule and chocolate ÃƒÂ©clair during our stay at MBS. This place had the best service out of all the places we experienced at MBS
2
MBS hotel is expensive and when you pay over USD$5 for a coffee that is like milky water like what you get from Starbucks it makes me mad ... but I kept going back everyday for the whole week as their Coconut & Mango Muffin's (SGD$3.20) are the bomb!! Yummo. Suh Fan if you made my last coffee last Friday (4/4) you started to get close how real coffee should be made
5
I got my morning coffee here everyday during my stay. Service was fast and polite. Probably the best experience of my stay.
5
They have great lattes and teas! Wonderful macaroons. Fresh and delicious cupcakes and cookies! Friendly staff.
5
Mouth watering good!! I was a perfect sweet pick me up conveniently located downstairs.. my only gripe... it closed at 10pm :)
4
Was a great drop of coffee and had some yummy Danishes to savour! Went here on two occasions while at marina bay sands. Good, fast service!
4
We took coffee from here a couple of times during our stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. It is more of a cake shop so seating is limited. But the coffee was produced well.
5
Ate breakfast there every morning. Good coffee and delicious breads and croissants. Haven't tried and pastries but they look good too.
5
Located in the lobby of tower 3 so it was easy access to get a good coffee and a croissant in the morning. The line up for pastries the rest of the day and at night, is a testament to how yummy they are.
3
Ok, we coffee drinkers need our nice cup of char in the morning, it has to be hot, strong for most of us & full of flavour, well here you will get one out of 3. It was Hot flavourless even after asking for a double shot & the getting another shot on top. Worst of all it cost an arm & a leg, avoid at all cost
4
Located in a small corner of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this non-descript, simple-looking deli cafe actually concealed the best pastries. We attacked the counter filled with wide array of pastries on display the moment we entered, and grabbed a seat to share the various delectable cakes we'd selected.The above two were our very favorites, and were highly recommended by various friends and reviews as well. First, the Dark Chocolate Orange cake - the pastry itself was moist and buttery soft, sandwiched with dreamy chocolate mousse, and filled the mouth with aroma of dark chocolate and tangy fragrance of orange - hitting the right spots in all manners indeed.Then we had the Raspberry Earl Grey cake - another wonderful creation of sour-sweetness infused with rich tea flavor - a lovely fusion of fruits and the slightly ashy tinge of Earl Grey. Simply divine, had our senses dancing with delight.I had a tea too - oh, don't be fooled by its tacky paper-cup appearance - SweetSpot serves TWG teabags, in very limited flavors though.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/tea-at-sweet-spot-bakery-and-cafe-mbs.htm
5
I went there twice - the first time, my cappucino was fantastic but the second time I ordered a caramel latte and it tasted like warm milk. Was a little disappointed with my coffee but the cakes/sweets were yum! I definitely will come back just for the sweets
4
Bought a couple of cakes here and they were really nice. Even enjoyed the hot chocolate but I thought that $6 for a small was a bit expensive. Location and convenience for your sweet tooth fix is ideal.
2
I love their coffee. The display of their desserts was fabulous, but I was just disappointed with the taste. Macaroons were hard, croissants were dry. I won't go back for desserts again.
5
We bought yogurts, croissants, butter and jam so we could breakfast cheaply at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel as the hotel breakfasts were very expensive and not especially good. The croissants were huge and very delicious. Great service and lovely food.
5
THis was situated in the marina bay sands hotel. It has great cookies. cakes, ice chocolates and fantastic coffee. Mohan was a great staff member - extremely efficient and friendly.
4
Looking for a quick breakfast? Grab a couple of the cheese buns (with cream cheese on the inside) and a large baguette. Ask for some jam and it makes a lovely breakfast!
4
The outlet at the MBS Shoppes sells a delicious selection of toasted sandwiches, although on the pricey end. The coffee is great. The outlet at the MBS hotel sells only ready-made food, i.e. no cooks.
4
Good choice of buns, sandwiches and drinks but quite expensive compared to UK prices. Try the lychee Danish and the tomato rolls. The cheese roll was too sweet
4
OMG the pastries are amazing...not so much the coffees. Given that this is Singapore which isn't renowned for great coffees - the pastries was by far worth the tolerable coffee that goes with it.
3
Every time I passed this bakery that was just across from our room elevators my tongue got closer to the floor. Finally I could resist no longer. I made my purchases in 2's for my traveling companion and myself. Each time I selected 2 of an item I was told to pick a third item at no additional charge - buy 2 get 1 free. Unfortunately the taste and texture did not live up to my expectations, nor those of my traveling companion
5
YUM! Amazing cakes and design. It is like eating a piece of artwork made from skilled bakers. Located inside Marina Bay Sands this bakery is a chocolate/cake lovers heaven. Definitely worth a visit, make sure you aren't full so you can sample more bakery items.Amongst all the baked items I ate the Almond Croissant was by far the most amazing and very naughty
