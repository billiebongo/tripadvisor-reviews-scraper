Restaurant never dissapoints me or my family or friends whenever iam there. It serves chinese cruisines. Not only are the foods nice but foods are served promptly after you have ordered. Recommended for dinner definately.

We tried their extended promotion of 2kilos chili crab for $88 and it was amazing! One of the best chili crab I tasted üòãüòãüòã fried bun is always a perfect match together with bottles of beer üëèüëèüëè
Lala, sambal fish are also a MUST üëçüèª

The chili crab is better this time round although they can be more generous with the gravy. The buns are consistent and great. Although they said they would try to get crabs with roe, it didn't happen. Go early if you want crab roe in your chili crab I guess? The place is hard to park and pretty noisy. No aircon

Stumbled on this place by accident but what a happy accident! We had a great lunch, very tasty even for our limited western pallets.The staff were very attentive and friendly and helped us to make our choices from the menu.Setting and decor were simple as you'd expect away from the cbd but that didn't affect the food. Great flavours.We also found it very affordable for us at $20 for 2 including alcohol free drinks. Shame I was driving a motor bike, would have loved a Tiger with my lunch!

We have not been to this place for 2-3yrs, but were pleasantly surprised the standard is still the same, good food and tasty. The HarCheong Kai is really the best in around and the portion os considered big.We did not try the crabs this time but they do not have any crab promotion currently.Will try again next time
4
The only surprise I had here is that the Menu had no prices. This is not quite something we are used to in Singapore. Nonetheless, they are v reasonable.At point of ordering, pls check quantity/size of dish and price.Also, arrive at 6pm (no later) if you have no reservations. Those who came at 645pm were waiting for tables. For large groups, i recommend reservations lest everyone gets impatient. Carpark is also an issue after 630pm. Food is really good! prawn paste chicken is amazing, and the hotplate beef was tender and sweet!

This restaurant is very popular because of its good food and reasonable pricing. Come early or else you won't get a table. This place is always crowded and busy during weekend dinner time. Dispense with dining etiquette and just have a great time eating. Now it's time to write about the food we ate. We were recommended the fried sea food beehoon which is one of their signature dishes. It was disappointing as the taste was bland and not apettising. It is difficult to fry broccoli with garlic only and produce a great dish. They did this well and the dish is full of 'wok hei" and the broccoli was tender and tasty. The sambal fish head curry has the perfect sour taste to make it desirable. The onion omelette was almost perfectly done with some parts of the egg a little running. The fried kailan was average. The claypot vegetarian tofu was another dish which was loved by us. The best dish of the night was the fried prawn paste chicken. Much better than any fired chicken from any fast food place. The place is suppose to be great for crabs but we did not order any.Do come for the food. Great food but can be warm on a hot evening as it is not air conditioned.Good for a return trip

Ban Leong Wah Hoe Seafood Restaurant is practically an institution with its 30-year history, and the pedigree shows in the cooking - simple old school style but done well. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m surprised it took me so long to discover this place!What impressed me the most was how value for money the whole dining experience was. For just $88, you get chili crab that can easily feed 6 adults or more comfortably. The sauce could have been slightly more robust but I loved how generous they were with the eggs in it. And most importantly, the crabs were so fresh and were so tender and succulent. This is not always the case elsewhere and you often find such dishes with the crab meat overcooked.The fried Mee Sua was a real standout and even came with quail eggs. The claypot beancurd was well done and chock full of ingredients. The prawn paste chicken was nicely done too.The portions here are really generous. With the complimentary fried rice and 5x$10 vouchers that you can pre-purchase for just $5, this place is hard to beat for value and quality

We went for the chilli crab offer - 2kg for $88. It is very fresh and 2kg has about 4 crabs for our plate. Lots of gravy but feels that it's lacking a bit in amount egg. On the whole, the crab dish is sumptuous and especially good with the mantou. We added on prawn paste chicken, deep fried squid and stir fried spinach. The prawn paste chicken is delicious too. Deep fried squid is nicely done, not overly cooked that it become too hard. However the vegetable is disappointing. By the way, their sambal chilli is good. :)

This is the place to go for the chilli crab, buns and fried mee sua last time. Typical zhe char store and reasonably priced. The only issue is that the chilli crab is sometimes inconsistent, the meat can be old and tough. So choose your crab wisely, don't leave it to them to do it for you. Parking is difficult in this area. They probably need to do some mosquito control around their area as we have never failed to get bitten. Do note the crab is of seasonal pricing, so don't get a bill shock without checking the price per kg before ordering any

It's a must to go to this restaurant.
The prawn paste chicken, samba fish, chilli crab, fried new sua, and LA LA is a must eat. Awesome üòã
5
The food here is the best! Its a must eat every time I'm in Singapore. Especially the Chilli Crab and Prawn Paste Chicken!
5
Chilli crab portion was generous, fried chicken wings are highly recommended!
The restaurant atmosphere was bustling and lively, tend to be most crowded among food places in the neighbourhood.
5
Having tried many different, chili crabs, I found the one at Ban Leong to be the most delicious and the best value. I would only eat chilli crab here with my friends and family and I highly recommend anyone to visit this one.
5
This is a must visit local restaurant where their famous dishes include chicken wings, chili and black pepper crabs, just to name a few. This is a place where the local people and even chefs highly recommend, can't miss it at all!
5
Love the variety of dishes offered, the friendly atmosphere and do try the crab dishes, absolutely my favourite! Brought my expat friends and all loved it! Keep up the good work!
5
Spacious setting with loads of selection from the usual fanfare of local delicacies! Had a great time with my friends whilst the food was served quickly with high quality.
5
Visited the place because of their Chilli Crab challenge. Fat crabs! Personally love the mee goreng but all the zi char is great. Go for lunch if you want zero waiting time and even more personalised service.
5
Last visit was 10 years ago after moving to NZ. The quality of the foods remains the same excellent standard. We have 2 crabs and lot of foods and the cost of the dinner is reasonable. Will come back again and highly recommended

Tasted the best shrimp paste chicken last night. It was so well flavoured that it still tasted great even when its cold.Price are reasonably priced for all the dishes so that you can feed a whole village without burning a hole in your pocket.Service was excellent there also as the staffs there are still attentive to your needs even when the place is packed

I'm giving 3 stars because though the food is generally tasty. The CNY dish Lou-Hei is a HUGE disappointment.
Who would have imagined in lieu of raw fish slices, you get fried ikan billies?
Enough said. I've no mood to write further.
4
This is great big groups kopitiam gathering
We tried the pepper crabs, butter prawns, steam fish, fried chicken, crispy baby octopus, fried toufu, venison hotplate, fried veg and few rounds along wif lime juice
Only cost $40 per pax.
Value for $$

Pretty reliable place for a Zhichar dinner... the famous Mee Sua dish was however slightly cold when it arrived which took away the enjoyment a little.

i love love their suckling pig which u must call to order in advance.
beside that will b chilli crabs, la la, fried baby squids and many more. been visiting this place for years. the food quality rremained the same (good).

As a visitor to Singapore, I've been here twice having been introduced to Ban Leong by family.The food is excellent and clearly the locals think so too! A western tourist might be put off by the plastic chairs, basic interior, but this is quite normal for local dining. Completely not pretentious!We started with prawn roll, fried baby squid and ohtak roll. The latter of the three was ok, but first two were excellent.We followed up with fantastic and authentic chilli crab (not too spicy and messy eating as always!), accompanied by excellent salt fish rice, mee goring (nice spicy heat) and vegetables.We finished with 'or nee' (a local dialect 'teo chew' dessert).This venue is well worth a visit
5
This place has undoubtedly the BEST Chilli Crab in Singapore. The buns are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the crab fresh and the sauce oh so delicious. If you want to try authentic Chilli Crab, you HAVE to come here to give it a go. Trust me... I've been to the most expensive places like Jumbo and No Signboard, I've also been to the local places like East Coast Lagoon Food Village. This is by FAR... The best one.

I chanced upon this restaurant many years ago, since then I would visit occasionally to enjoy the food. The restaurant claim to have very good chill crab, and qualify for a connoisseur award some years back. But I think they have managed to keep their quality as good even today.The place has a classic local coffeeshop feel, like those from the 1980's, and many a times one can find many people in groups, big and small, coming to this restaurant to order the signature dish: chili crab.I would not pick its best, but go for simple dishes such as stir-fried lettuce in onion, prawn paste chicken drumlet and drunken prawns in Chinese herbal soup. The last dish is as good as two dishes : Herbal soup and well cooked fresh prawns. But the dishes have not failed to impress me

This restaurant is famous for the crab and it doesn't disappoint on that matter. The chilli crab is huge and tasty (we ordered 1.3 kg crab size), so does the schezuan chicken. But other dishes such as sambal kangkong and tofu with prawn are not too nice & tasty. Pricing for the crab is not cheap, at S$ 60 per kg, and what really disppoint is they originally tried to charge us 1.5 kg of crab even though we ordered 1.3 kg, without confirming with us first. In the end they agreed to charge us 1.3 kg only after long debate.
4
We were brought here by a local and were provided with a huge banquet including some of the largest mud crabs I had ever seen. Both the Chilli crab and Pepper crab were the highlights of our trip to Singapore. The many other dishes we tried at this restaurant were also delicious. The restaurant was not fancy and the service was a little perfunctory however, this place is a great alternative to the many of the fine dining experiences available in Singapore

If you are looking to eat big crabs, with claws bigger than a drumstick, this is the place. NOt the easiest place to find for tourist but you can always call to book, uber there to collect and take it back to your hotel to salvage. It works for me. P.S. Getting more and more ex though. It was around $30/kg but the last time (oct 16) i went, if i did my math right, is around $60/kg now

Clams full of mud. Staff was rude and they were not apologetic, disappeared after I made the complaint, argued that dirt in the food is unavoidable. Avoid at all costs.
5
The parking here is often a night mare, it's hard to find parking. However the food is cheap and good, u can also bring your own booze, I like the chili drab and pig liver fried bee hoon, very special, got wok hei.
5
One of the best catch! Reasonable price & tasty food! Thumbs up for their fried mee-sua too! Will definitely be back for more!
5
a no brainer !!!
went there with the entire family
excellent food
great advise
quick service
we did not have seafood of fish though but their porc, beef and chicken were excellent
same as noodles and rice dish
4
We could not try the chili crab but the steamed ginger and shallot crab was excellent. The sweet and sour fish, stir-fried spinach and fried rice were also excellent. A very good no-fuss place in that area.
5
Though it is difficult to find parking especially during the weekend, it did not mar our dinner experience. According to a few reviews, the har cheong kai (prawn paste chicken) was highly recommended as it is their specialty dish. It came out fast and furious and did not disappoint with its crispy exterior and juicy meat. The lala was good and a little spicy. The seafood mee sua was done just right. The spinach was just a tad salty but that could be because we did not have plain white rice. The steamed fish at $28 was nice and tender. According to the waitress, they buy their own seafood direct which is why they are able to sell them at a lower price. Heard from a friend that their black pepper crabs are solid. Will leave that for our next visit. We ordered cold chrysanthemum tea and it came in a pot which was refillable. At $1.20 per person, very reasonably priced. What we liked as well was the fact that they actually asked if we wanted the pickles and wet tissue so you have a choice. Will definitely be back.

Had a management dinner at ban Leong Wah hoe just, like always the Chilli crabs and pepper crabs never fail to please. The best pepper crabs in town , some may love the Chilli crabs more, but both are just succulent , finish them with some beer and it's just heavenly. U will definitely appreciate the cooking and no frills presentation 
5
I've been dining at Wah Hoe Seafood for the past 20 odd years. My favorite dishes are the prawn paste chicken wings, hot plate deer meat and black pepper crab. If you're planning to visit them over the weekend, be sure to make a reservation. It gets really crowded
5
A colleague chose this place for a couple of overseas colleagues to try out Cze Char. We ordered sambal kangkong, clams, crabs (Chilli & Black Pepper), Beef stirred fried with Spring Onions and Oyster Omelet. Everyone enjoyed the food. For this round, Black Pepper is better than Chilli

Located in the Ang Mo Kio area next to the jungled water catchment, more or less in the middle of the island. A taxi from Chinatown took about 20 minutes. The local atmosphere is a nice change of scene from the sterility of the downtown. The restaurant has that cheap and cheerful vibe of the plastic tables and stools variety. Looks clean and the service is fast. Every dish tasted good and the chilli crab was awesome. We had a lot of food plus beer which averaged out at about S$38 per head, so fairly good value for Singapore
