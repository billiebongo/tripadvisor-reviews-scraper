We bought a whole lot of cakes for a party and we're delighted at the rich and full flavour. Great presentation too! Not to be missed!

My partner bought this for my mum's birthday. While fattening, it is actually rather tasty. We picked this up from the middle of a normal looking neighbourhood and Ciel stood out from the rest with strong exterior decor.
Do try the cakes there!

An unexpectedly classy cafe in a public housing area. Cakes are average but they put a lot of attention on the packaging and presentation. Impressive!

Located in a heartland area, this cafe stands out with its exterior design. I would recommend the ice latte, brownie and cheesecake. They have a selection of cakes and beverages and the prices are not too expensive. They have seats inside and outside the cafe.

The cafe is located under a HDB block, so is accessible and easy to find. The shop have wide range of cake choices. An outstanding cafe in HDB area. But taste so so, not wow. Design not bad

Ciel is a reliable patisserie that produces wonderful cakes in an Hougang neighbourhood worthy of a French trained patissier. I love the strawberry shortcake, while it's tiramisu is equivalent to Pete's Place at Grand Hyatt and in many restaurants in Italy. I did not taste any gelatine which lowers the cost and quality. Another nice dessert is the bombe if you love chocolate. I wish they can offer some savoury pastries to offset the sweets offered in this delightful place.

Cakes, tarts , tea, coffee, staffs' service are all superb I have been a fan since they open about 3 years ago. Standard of cakes haven't change since then, as good as it was before! As a student, it is affordable and a great place for me to chill, hangout or even catch up with old friends. The staffs are welcoming, polite and really friendly. Here's a list of things that I would really recommend!1. Strawberry shortcake : best seller over there, freshly baked (you can literally taste the fresh strawberries) - in my opinion, it goes really well with their sparkling strawberries tea2. Bombe : dark chocolate cake with blueberries- for huge fans of chocolate3. Fraiché : strawberry tart (there's a pechê tart but I'm a fan of strawberries) the custard and the berries are so good together!4. Chocolate caramel tart : It's so so so good!!!!! Chocolate and caramel at the bottomed of the tart!5. Lemon Meringue tart: meringue and lemon custard at the bottom, they both go well together !6. Quiche: they have different filling. On certain days, ham only , other days ham and mushroom, or even ham and onion! Savory and I just love the crust and everything in it!7. Sel : dark chocolate layer with a salted buttery layer cake. It's on days when you need that dark chocolate + salty crave , unique taste. I love how well it goes together!Tea: Bohemian raspberry, sparkling strawberries and dancing flowers are my favourite teasCoffee: ice latté are so refreshin

We went on a Saturday around 3pm to celebrate a friend's birthday. It's not a big place but glad that there's no crowd. We ordered 3 desserts based on their recommendation.1) Strawberry shortcake. The cream is nice. 2) Lemon Meringue Tart. Tasty to eat the cream, lemon and tart together at one go.3) Bombe (Chocolate mousse with blueberry). It didn't look nice compared to other cakes but we love the chocolate and the blueberries. Must order.It's a small cozy and homely place. We didn't try out the teas and coffees. I saw a capsule machine for the coffee, so we were not keen to try out the coffee. There's free water available. I requested for a candle for the shortcake and the staff was friendly to assist.A great place for cakes.
