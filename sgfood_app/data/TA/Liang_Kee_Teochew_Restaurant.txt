Love their cold crabs. Service is prompt and attentive. Great teochew food. Will return for more! We could not try many dishes as there were too few of us.

We found out that the former Liang Kee has closed and was bought over by a PRC gentleman who retained its cuisine, chefs and employees, operating under the name of "Orchid Seafood Restaurant: at the same address. We enjoyed the cold crabs, Teochew braised duck and home-made pumpkin yam paste. but not the crispy golden dragon chicken (only its skin but not its meat). The service was quick and efficient. The PRC owner was courteous and helpful. Will return in the near future

This unassuming restaurant at public housing block in an old neighbourhood is simply done up but the quality of its food can rival the posh restaurants in the city centre. Serving simple yet tasty dishes at very reasonable prices and with no service charge, their signature homestyle cabbage rice is a must-have. Service is warm and efficient. Truly a hidden gem deserving of more attention

This place is rather non-descript and looks rather much like a high-class coffeeshop with air-con and table-cloth adorning the table top. It has a very casual and laid-back feel, but it was brightly lit and soothed by the green-ness of the restaurant. There was no service charge despite the friendly service.After ordering a pot of hot tea, we had the Braised Duck served to us - cut finely in thin slices, tender and soft in flesh; the gravy was not too salty or thick. It was delicious, I just wondered why the fried beancurd (tau kwa) wasn't ordered because usually the braised duck comes together with beancurd.Next, the Deep Fried Prawn Rolls - I had initially thought it was the "Ngor Hiang" from the looks of it, but one crispy bite into the delicacy told me I was way wrong. The sweet palatable flavor of the prawn was unmistakable, and rather strong. It was not oily (amazingly) but was crispy and the rest just melted into the mouth deliciously.Then we had the Prawns with Garlic Chives - the gravy tasted like pork / chicken broth. The garlic chives were soft and easy to chew, with a refreshing overture. The prawns were bouncy with freshness and its juicy flavor was notably scrumtious. Mushroom slices enhanced the overall flavor.For more detailed information or photos, please feel free to drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/dinner-at-liang-kee-teochew-restaurant.htm

I have dined at the original Liang Kee near Ellenborough market many years ago, and found the food today as good. For a party of 4 we decided to go for the set meal, which included a steamed pomfret, sambal crayfish, braised duck, stire fried vegetable, cabbage rice and winter melon soup. Every disc was delicious and well prepared. The steam fish was very fresh, meaty, firm yet tender. The crayfish comes in generous portion and the sambal was tasty and not too spicy. The soft and thin slices of braised duck were one of the best I have eaten. The meal was wrapped up with Orh Nee as desert plus fresh fruits. Service here is excellent too, highly recommended for Teochew foodies
