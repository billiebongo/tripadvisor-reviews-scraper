Love the place with good Cantonese and Malaysian style. Hokkien mee is really good. Malaysian style very authentic. The right dark sauce and lard! Mee Hoon prawn was also very good. Just the amount of oil...not too much. The steamed fish was fresh and the deep fried pig intestine was also very good. Vege 4 Heavenly Kings with sambal also very Malaysian. Authentic and really good. Reasonably priced and excellent service. The mango pomelo was excellent. Should try at least once

Gathered at Food T Us for dinner with travel buddies. Bottom line: no scraps left to tau pau. Food pretty tasty however having lived in KL their black Hokkien mee was not what others say it was. Not bad but couldn’t satisfy Malaysian friends Malaysian palates There are a few restaurants in Johor that come closer to the ‘real thing’. This one whole not bad a little way to go to be on par with the real KL noodles in, where else .... KL. This Resturant pretty good though and worth the trek over to Farrer Road.

Had the most amazing dinner last night at Food R Us, the food was superb and service was excellent! This resaurant was highly recommended to us by local friends and didn't disappoint. Unfortunately, I didn't get more photos... this is just a snapshot of the feast we enjoyed

This Chinese restaurant is set within the housing estate at Farrer Road. They accept reservations for table booking and service is excellent. We ordered the roasted Char Siew, fried chicken, fried pork knuckles, Yuan Yang noodles, KL noodles (with lots of fried pork lard!), Steamed Tapah fish. Very good experience and will be back!

We came for dinner. Clean, modern, nice atmosphere. The staff are happy and friendly, which improves the whole experience. It's the food that marks it out; sweet and sour fish wasn't cloyingly sweet; the 'kai lan two ways' was original and a triumph ; the aubergine with chicken Floss was superb, and the stuffed yam ring was my favourite. Very popular, and much nicer than its heavily - reviewed neighbour.

The best Hokkien mee in Singapore. Black Kuala Lumpur style one. U need to wait for 30 minutes for them to braise the pork lards into the mee. A lot of pork lards. But the taste when it out. Damn!!!U must try the BBQ pork (Char Siew) also. Delicate delicacy. Nice to stumble upon such nice food. 100% going back

Friend recommended this place for CNY gathering. Since then, have gone back at least twice. Quality of food has not disappointed. Well known for their char siew, pork knuckle and the kl hokkien mee. Have learnt to call ahead to 'chope' the char siew in case they run out of it !

We had our company CNY dinner and loh hei at this restaurant last night. The food was above average. We had the usual 8 course CNY set menu, but the 3 dishes which stood out for me were :1) Stuffed fish maw soup - i usally take fish maw as it is, never seen it stuffed before. And it added another layer of texture to it.2) Pineapple prawns - interesting combination, fresh prawns with a slightly sweet/sour after taste of pineapple. A deviation from the usual cereal or salted egg yolk.3) Lotus wrapped rice - i'm not a fan of lotus wrapped anything but their preparation method (mixture of glutinous rice with brown rice) made it more fragrant and moist. Too bad it came towards the tail end of dinner and most of us were already full.Accessibility is not an issue as it is next to Farrer MRT and there are plenty of parking lots on the first floor too.Overall a nice cosy restaurant suitable for any occasion. I would drop by again if i'm around the area

We've eaten here a few times. The Malaysian style caramelized dark "char siew" was excellent - preorder if you must have it as it tends to run out. We did when we reserved our table for dinner and was told we got the last order. The Kuala Lumpur style black Hokkien "mee" (noodles) were excellent as always. They ran out of pork liver - pity, one of our favorites. Fish slices with ginger and spring onions and "4 spicy vegetables" - eggplant, okra (ladies fingers), long bean and "petai" (local "stinky beans") - were all great. Only dish that disappointed was the oyster egg. We usually order more or less the same dishes whenever we visit - we have our favorites and they were almost always excellent, so could not comment on the rest of the cooking . Being close to Chinese New Year, they also had cookies and other goodies for sale, sourced "home baked" from Malaysia too. Quite good.
