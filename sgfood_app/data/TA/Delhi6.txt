Most disappointed with poor quality dosa and idlis this morning. Such a waste of money and time. Please avoid this place.

This restaurant has never disappointed anytime you go. Great menu and good street food. Good service.

Several visits to this restaurant and not once disappointed. Food is tasty and freshly prepared...
Good for breakfast, lunch and dinner
5
Greeted by a polite staff. Great northern Indian cuisine. Butter chicken is a must try'! First choice for my partner and I when it comes to where to have our dinner or lunch.

We had just gotten to the Village Hotel Katong and walked into the shopping mall under it. Diesel6 had a prime location and an interesting message board. We had Kingfisher beer, red and white wine, Mutton Rogan, Popeye Sailor (vegetarian), Mutton Skewers, Onion and Garlic Kulchas. Big plates, great food, attentive waitstaff
4
Situated below the Village hotel in Katong this place doesn't look much, typical shopping centre restaurant but the food was great. Lots of vegetarian dishes and chicken or lamb, kebabs seem to be a speciality. Loved the taste and it felt like a genuine Indian restaurant. Service very efficient too. We walked past on the way to a supermarket and the place was empty, grabbed a seat on our return and within minutes there was not a spare table. They seem to do deliveries also

Delhi6 Katong now has very good lunch sets (weekdays only, I think), vegetarian for $9.90 nett, the chicken and fish sets slightly more. Been there twice now and very satisfied both times. The affable waiters usher you to the table and wait patiently for you to order. Water is provided and a fruit drink too. Delicious pappadam with mint and chilli dips, cut small onions are served as appetizer. Each set is generous and very filling, the tandoori chicken tender and falling nicely off the bone, yellow dhal and a mixed fried vegetable, fresh cucumber and carrot, come in the platter while the basmati rice and one plain naan is more than enough for normal appetites. The vegetarian set features two grilled paneer cubes, didn't try the fish set so can't comment. Dessert is also served, fried dough in syrup, not too sweet, good.Decor is pleasing and environment calm and quiet.Hope they maintain this high standard of food and service and I'll be their frequent customer

I stayed at Village Hotel in Aug'17, I was in Singapore for 2 weeks, as an Indian food lover, one of my first task was to explore Indian restaurants nearby. On day one i found Delhi6, right in the same location of the hotel. And guess what, i didn't have to explore any more. The place was very convenient for me. They had good variety of food option.. and tastes good. Give it a try and you would like it.
4
Small space , however the takeaway service seemed to be a roaring success, this restaurant was a welcomed find as it was part of a shopping arcade below the hotel we were stay at in Katong.After a day sightseeing we opt for this restaurant, we ordered the Mushrooms Kebabs, Palak Paneer, a Mango Lassi, and a beer plus rice all delicious will return
4
Nice place to have a tasty northern Indian meal. The spices used for seasoning was just right. The chicken and fish didn't taste like plain meat. it was juicy and tasty. Will come again. Friendly waiting staff too
5
I love this place, its my local Indian takeout and they cook all their meat in the tandoor. The flavour is amazing.
5
I found this as the best Indian restaurant out of many on east coast road,. Had ordered roti, methi malai paneer , mixed veg n dal. All the dishes were yummy. Highly recommended
5
Great food. Full of flavour and good portions. This is my third visit and it did not disappoint again!
5
Amazing authentic food served by the best personal weâ€˜ve seen this year! Extremely attentive and more then happy to give you great recommendations. The food itself is amazingly well done and presented in style - it will be hard to find equally tasty meals at this price anywhere close!Loved it and look forward to my next visit!
1
lamb chop had a pungent smell, wife complained to mgt but was told its due yo mustard oil marination.ordered my usual fav chicken butter tikka masala but was totally let down. gone was the aromatic and savoury gravy. instead we were presented with ordinary tasting dish. eggplant curry was also too oily and heavy this time.dont know what has happenedthis used to be my favourite indian restaurant in east coastreally hope they bring back the standardsand yes.... drafted beer too
1
I decided to visit this restaurant based on reviews. Ordered the boneless lamb from the menu but it was full of bones, that says it all. Biriyani was poor, most of the food was left untouched. Paid close to 80 SGD. It's not worth half that and that is being kind. Won't be visiting again next time in Singapore
1
As I was working at home I wanted to treat myself to nice curry. After looking up the reviews I decided to go for dehli 6. I ordered mutton Rogan Josh. What a disappointment. The curry was full of bones. Even the gravy had bits of bones in it. I felt incredibly cheated as the curry is not cheap. Will never ever have their food again!!
4
Very quiet, little restaurant below the Village Hotel katong. We were there for breakfast. quick and neat service. Food was tastier too. would definitely recommend to people try it. I didn't know about this place until the third day of my stay, so would recommend the owners of this place to advertise their presence at Village Hotel Katong
4
I stayed at the Village Hotel Katong, the hotel a floor above Delhi 6 and was happy to find this restaurant nearby. I ordered takeaway my last night in Singapore and found the prices reasonable. The food was good and the service was seriously, outstanding - quick, honest and each person I spoke with seemed to sincerely appreciate my business. If I return to the area, I will definitely return
3
Food was above average
Ambience was ok
Staff were polite and quick service
Small place
$$ dinner for 2 ( includes 2 breads 1 biryani and 1 veg curry)
3
When we were dining there on a weekday, it was only one table.... our table...
Service is quick and good.
Not much about ambience.
Food is slightly above average.
5
We ordered for a home Delivery through Foodpanda, and this place served us the most delicious Mutton Biryani ever. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste and freshness of my food. Thumbs Up.
4
We liked the food served at this establishment. But, the prices are quite high for what you get. Perhaps this is just typical of Singapore, which seems expensive to me.
4
Went for dinner to celebrate my Wife birthday, surprised to restaurant is so small but there were only one other table which was occupied so didn't feel cramped.Chef was welcoming to customise the dishes. Appetiser of Tandoori chicken and Veg cutlet was delicious and fresh. For mains, Chicken and Paneer dishes were okish but Prawn curry was excellent, had such good one after a Long time. Choice of dessert was mediocre. Service was prompt and polite, overall a good choice
5
Shared with us the recipe of their drinks and food and also gd service even though we could not make our mind with the bookings thks kumar we are coming again kumar on the 15/11/16 at 6.30pm again for the birthday party we have already book our tables see u kumar on tuesday
5
Deli 6 .. The best ever restaurant I have seen in Singapore .. If you are serious about Indian food and non veg food just visit here and order anything from menu card .. They will not disappoint you .. Been here almost in my every visit to Singapore with friends and family and everybody says "wow " .. Katong is like heave for foodies and deli 6 adds the best destination for sure .. Try tikka and mango lassie .. The best even better than any Indian hotel back in India .. Just walk in and enjoy your food
5
I go here every time I come to Singapore. In fact, I frequently stay in the hotel right above the shopping mall in which Delhi 6 is located just so I can eat there whenever I want. The food is fresh and vibrant, and they offer a wide vegetarian selection. Its a small joint, but comfortable enough, and the management is friendly and helpful. I forgot my laptop once, and the manager tracked me down in the supermarket nearby to return it
2
Business behavior is a bit tricky. On coupon, it says free flow and does mention 5-8pm (but we didn't pay attention, our fault). We arrived at 7pm (during phone booking, they didn't mention that 8pm thing either!), started to order food. No one reminded us that order would be stopped by 8pm. So the food came, one plate of chicken, one plate of vegetables, no biryani as promised in the deal. But we were not fussy about it since we thought we could ask for next round. It was quite busy during that hour and we couldn't get waiter's attention even our table was empty for a while. Until around 8:03pm, the waiter came, picking up the empty plates. We asked for another round, and were told sorry the coupon hour was finished. But for the sake of courtesy, they would give us biryani rice....Disappointed. When we were about to leave the restaurant, we did complain to the manager and his attitude was " yeah, it is a busy time' without sincere apologize. Won't recommend
3
Had a family lunch here for three of us. Restaurant is in a shopping mall in a bright and airy space. Service was attentive and the food was very good. Chicken kebabs were great and very moist and tasty and reasonable at 12 dollars. Lamb kebabs were dry and portion was very small and very poor value indeed at 16 dollars. If you go avoid this. Nan bread was great as was rice. We would go again and choose more carefully next time.
3
We ordered the kebab platter which was good esp the mutton/chicken. Chicken biryani was v avg though, more of ghee+rice. Ambience is avg, it's in a small mall. Seemed busy with lot of takeaways.
4
Very tasty Indian food, good variety of dishes. Reasonably priced. Efficient and friendly service. Nice decoration as well. One point less for the atmosphere (located in a shopping mall). Plenty of parking available on the parking in front of the mall.
3
Actually the food was quite good. However, i can only agree that the portions are too small for the prices.
3
I cannot give a complete feedback of their menu as me and my friend purchased a Groupon Coupon for free flow of Kebabs and Biryani with 5 beers for 50 SGD. Ravi and Muthu welcomed us and immediately gave us plain water and roasted papads. Place was empty considering it was 6:30 PM on a Friday. But that doesn't mattered to us. We had our place of tranquility. We started with the non-vegetarian kebab which was really great, went along well with Stella Artois and San Miguel. Followed by Vegetarian Kebab platter and again Non-Veg. Kebabs tasted real good and were hot from the oven. We still had place for Chicken Biryani was it was mentioned in the coupon. It did disappoint us in many ways. I cannot say it was Biryani at all. It was very bland and chicken looked like steamed one forcibly mixed with rice. But we decided to let it go. We went there second time, as my friend Sandeep Reddy told me that he got a Discount Voucher of 8 SGD. So, there we go - 2 crazy Indians again to the same place -- same food and this time it was only Mr. San Miguels. We learnt our lesson and didn't order Biryani. So, great experience.I can say Value for Money with the Groupon Coupon. Definitely a thing to try with the coupon
1
We visited this place in March 2016. Upon arrival a voucher with the value of 50 SGD was presented and I asked if this was accepted here. The leader said yes and took the voucher. Somewhat surprised, we decided after all to eat there. When the check arrived with no voucher refund, I asked if this was correct. Yes, was the answer. I reminded the waiter of the voucher and got a new check. This had to be paid in the office where the leader offered no excuse, only shoutings to his subordinates. The food was OK, but rather pricey, even with the deduction
5
We haven't yet visited this place, but have got the food home delivered on a number of occasions.The food is easily the best north Indian grub that we have had in Singapore. They also offer interesting variety in their menu(like olive naans etc). If you are looking for good north Indian food, try this place once
5
Awesome Indian food . All varieties of kababs. Value for money. Visited twice in 4 days. Dine in and take away options available . Mango Lassi was great . Location vise close to East coast and approx 15 min drive from airport . Hospitable and multilingual staff. Will surely visit again when in Singapore 
4
Had the lamb briyani last evening and also a side of tandoori chicken. The lamb was meltingly tender and flavourful. The basmati rice was very well cooked and bursting with flavour with every bite. I love my food spicy so I think this spice level was excellent. My 4 year old loved it as well although he did keep asking to have a drink. The tandoori was also flavourful but could have been a little more spicy.
5
It wasn't my first time at Delhi 6 but have to say that the kebabs are always brilliant. The personalized service an added asset, always feels good to go back when people remember you and your preferences. The quality is consistently superior giving me a taste of Indian food in India which says a lot. Having lived here for 19 years, this is the first restaurant of Indian origin that takes me home. Need I say more?
3
The restaurant is in the mall, bit difficult to find. We had gone with family for dinner. The food quantity was bit on lesser side. The taste was just about "ok", however no major concerns as the food was priced accordingly. The overall service was good
4
One of my favorite Indian restaurants in East side of city. Order from tablet with pics...go for meat and veg starters esp tandoori. Yummy nans to go and long grain rice briyani. Parking is easy and shop at Ntuc supermarket too next door.
5
Truly north indian cuisine - excellent menu and very well prepared dishes. We are big fans of the mutton galouti kebab and the ghost biryani.
4
This restaurant is located on the lower level of the Village Katong Hotel. Its small tucked away in one corner of the basement in the building but themenu and the food and the service is very good. Enjoyed our Indian meal thoroughly
4
I went to Delhi6 restaurant in april. the food is very tasty. their non veg dishes are superb. Staff is also very nice. Even though its not that spacious the food made for it.
4
For a shopping centre restaurant, this was great. Lovely decor, attentive staff and fresh and delicious food. Very reasonably priced. All three of us enjoyed our food. Definitely above average Indian.
4
Great North Indian food, very good value for money. I found the taste at the Republic Plaza outlet better than Katong outlet. The chefs are different.
2
We had ordered a biryani for take away and had a horrible experience with the staff. First of all, they did not serve me all that was mentioned on the menu. The biryani comes with dahi, papad and chutney.. They had only given me very little dahi ( enough for one person) , when I had ordered two big portions of biryani. The papad and chutney was not there. When asked they reluctantly gave us papad but said we don't give chutney and this is all that is. I told them that its mentioned on their menu and the guy (a bald guy) was really rude. I told them to change the menu if they don't want to provide it and he rudely said yes we will change the menu just for you. The lady also seemed very unfriendly. He literally ruined my entire afternoon. I would never wanna go there again. This is NOT how you treat your customers
3
Came across Delhi 6 when a colleague mentioned the outlet at Republic Plaza and looked them up. Found out that they have an outlet at Katong and decided to visit.First Impression: Tiny little place and good decor! Was excited to check out the food (as the menu and the website looked pretty good)Staff seems a little lazy and in shut down mode (although we went at peak dinner time)Food isnt something that blew my socks off at all. The mutton was well cooked but the gravy was watery and lacked flavours. The biryani is a tiny portion served ina little ceramic jar. For the price, its not worth it. Def a little pricey compared to its other counterparts in the area (which is okay if its worth it) but unfortunately it misses the mark.The menu is great but I'd now be a little hesitant in trying other dishes - cause they just seem to lack the flavour that will want you to ask for more.Definitely need to do better, loads of scope to improve
2
Recently I happened to dine at Delhi 6 for dinner with my family and had a terrible experience. The restaurant was quite small but neat and impressive. So I thought it will a good place to dine north Indian varieties. But it was quite opposite. I made a reservation two days before my visit but at the spot i had no reserved table under my name. Somehow we sat and decided to order.The orders were placed using tablet, quite appreciative .First we ordered was a Tandoori chicken. The marinated chicken was not cooked well. The serving portion was little. The staff were also lacking a prompt service. At one stage the naan I ordered was so rubbery than parotta.Mutton Briyani was served in a porcelain vessel size of the Indian pickle jar. If you had tasted mutton briyani in many places you will feel whether it was the same or some curry rice. The rice was over cooked hardly with 1 or 2 mutton pieces. I do cook mutton briyani well at home, tried at many restaurants throughout Singapore but it was the worst briyani I had ever tasted. No Raita for the briyani.The bill was S $90 with10% GST and service tax. Totally it was not worthy for the money I paid and for my craving appetite. I was highly disappointed with the dining and promised never to look back
5
We were staying at the Village Hotel Katong and were so lucky to have this fine Indian restaurant situated under our hotel.Wow the food was amazing, the staff lovely and service great. We are a family of 7 and enjoyed 3 yummy dinners whilst staying at the hotel for a week. I would highly recommend this to anybody staying in Singapore, it's worth the drive from the city to eat there.Definitely the best Indian food we have eaten, thanks :
4
Loved the ability to order at the table via the iPod. Didn't notice that at first. Great food, rapid service.
5
One of the best north indian thalis..
Great place to hang out in CBD..
Wide variety of north indian dishes..
4
Very yummy Indian food for reasonable price. The serving people were very warm and service was very prompt.
1
Very rarely do I ever write a review - in this case, having seen the last review of Delhi6 I felt it deserved a follow up. Having also experienced the worst behaviour from their wait staff I demanded the contact details of the owner / manager (Mr Rahul), which was only given to me after I threaten to contact the police due to their appalling behaviour. What's most unfortunate Mr Rahul could care less about his customers and rather appear apologetic to resolve the situation (which would simply put the complaint to a close), it is also apparent that he attacks his customers by making up lies! Very sad to see!Enter this restaurant with great caution!
1
Disappointing to experience such rude and hostile service. Extremely unaccommodating and the arrogance of the staff baffles me!! There are plenty of other excellent options for Indian cuisine in the East Coast of Singapore - that won't put you through the unpleasantry of horrible service
4
Went to have lunch here today and it was a delight to have authentic Indian food here .i had a North Indian thali and it's wasn't disappointing at all . This outlet is located at raffles plaza and is ideal for lunch . Service is quick and food quality very good
5
HI, as per title i can literally say that it was the closest you can have in singapore thats actually taste like indian. i mean i will still say its only 7 out of 10 if i have to scale it in compare to what i used to have in Delhi but its not bad and as its not cheap then 2-3 times a month is not a bad idea, like impress your date with some nice indian food or taking your family to taste something exotic from local food. you can also have a wine if you like but i think kabab is a must try actually everything is nice, so give it a hit, i think you people will like it too
3
Delhi 6 as the name suggests gives the essence of delhi but only on the walls of the small restuarant. Food still is just average. Malai chicken tikka is a muat try and is fabulous. A bit on the upper side of the budget and not exactly value for money.Average price for 2 around 80-100 $. Including 2 starters, 2 main course gravies and chappatis.
4
I'm not sure whether the food is authentic but it's delicious. Delhi6 serves many variety of kebabs, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This is ideal for groups that have vegetarian and non-vegetarian members who will be dining together.The Malai Broccoli has a delicious seasoning and coupled with the roasted charred taste, will give you taste bud a kick. The chicken in the Murg Tikka Butter Masala is very tender and goes really well with the naan and parantha. I'm not sure but I don't think many Indian restaurants in Singapore serves parantha. The Mulani Barrah Kebab and Dal are also delicious. Overall, a satisfying meal
1
I went to the branch at Republic plaza at raffles place with a group of colleagues. All of us ordered food at the same time, my colleagues all received their food and I was still waiting endlessly for my food after twenty minutes! This is unacceptable. I went to the counter and was advised rudely by the lady at the counter that I should not be standing near the counter. I never got my food after thirty minutes and my colleagues were all done with their lunch. I decided to ask for a refund and was met with poor attitude from the cashier. I will never go to this restaurant again. Lousy service and poor service recovery
5
Went to Singapore on holiday with family, was looking for good Indian vegetarian restaurant, our hotel concierge recommended this place must say excellent choice, good variety, & delicious vegetarian food, must try kumbh kebab,will highly recommend this place for Indian food
5
Excellent food for the price you pay, tho I feel that the quantity is a little extra, the staff is extremely attentive and polite.
Great experience overall
4
Nice unique menu. Very quiet location. I am vegetarian and was happy with the choices though limited.
4
Having wanted to try the place out after having crossed it many times, finally we decided to indulge one of the evenings. Their rolls are their speciality and they only serve them during specific hours - so please call ahead to avoid disappointment! The quality of their dishes was really good and service was efficient. The only reason why this doesnt get a 5 for me was that I was surprised at their pricing - this isnt a fine dining restaurant in prime location but pricing was definitely prime location demanding. All said and done, I will be going back if wanting to eat good indian food without making a huge effort in terms of travel given proximity to where I stay and the convenience of being able to knock off a few chores on the list as well. The rolls on a takeaway night are another reason that I will be going back
3
It is very surprising that this restaurant does not have any drinks menu. I mean they do have ususal lassi and cola stuff but no cocktails or mocktails and only beer is served. Starters are very good. Portions and taste is very good but the main course requires improvement. I being from Delhi itself knows exactly how the butter chicken tastes back home. I tried few other main course options as we went to this restaurant a few times since it is just opposite to my home but like every time good starters but disappointing main course
4
Food was good, slightly pricey but worth paying for it. The restaurant is pretty small, with tables & chairs very close to one another. Service was good, and the food was served pretty quickly. Menu has vegetarian meals as well. Tips: Parents with active children (like myself) should take extra care because the water glasses, plates & cutlery are set up neatly on all tables. There is a high possibility of them knocking over the breakable glassware due to space constraint.
4
I went for lunch to their new branch (opened a month ago) at Republic Plaza in the CBD. There are some differences when compared to their Katong branch.First off, the food was good, not pricey and the staff were friendly. Service with a smile. The menu is fairly varied and they are happy to accommodate any special requests you may have.I'm a good eater, but found the quantities given quite large. I was unable to finish the rice quantity in their set meal.At this location, due to building regulations, they cannot have a proper tandoor or an open fire kitchen so all food is cooked electrically. Changes the taste somewhat, but not much. They also cannot stay open beyond 8pm.Well worth a visit
4
Its got decent food with an extra touch of spices, which Indian food is all about. The place is small and open, which sometimes did not worked as isolation is not there. But if your taste buds are craving for some spicy Indian sizzlers, go for a visi
5
I was pleasantly surprised to discover authentic Lucknawi kebabs in a place like Singapore, I endorse the taste and quality of their kebabs as I belong to the city of nawabs " Lucknow". The selection is large by overseas standards. Overall a good experience I strongly recommend it a must visit..
5
While the food is good the extra star is for introducing some dishes like Gaulati Kebab & Roomali Roti to the Singapore Culinary scene which were hitherto available only in few high end Indian Fine dining restaurants. We also had Dal Makhani, Pudina Parantha & Moong Dal halwa which were good along with aloo corn chaat & Masala Tea which were ok. The menu has one of the widest collection of kebabs I have seen in Singapore. Its a small place inside a mall and the ambience & service are nice
5
Been visiting for last 3 months, the food is excellent; the kebabs are to die for. No longer miss Delhi's food!
Highly recommended.
5
Awesome food..undoubtedly the best I've had in any of the restaurants during the trip. Would suggest everyone to visit and I personally would be coming back the next time I'm here....Delhi6 Rockz
5
The best kebabs in Singapore. Would love to go back again.
I would highly recommend the lamb chops, seekh kebab & Malai broccoli.
5
Delhi 6 is a fabulous place with wonderful ambience and great food. This is the best place for kebabs as and biryani within Singapore as it gives a true Indian flavour. Its main course is also very good. The prices are also reasonable. I will like to come again
1
We are vegetarians; soup was so horrible we Cudnt take even a sip.. Starter was full of oil and Cudnt identify the taste. Veg gravy was just bad no flavor or taste. Won't recommend this place for vegetarians.
5
Visited on a business trip whilst staying in a nearby hotelBest Indian kebabs I have hever had ( Barrah Kebab & Malai Tikka ) followed by Rogan Josh & Baked Yoghurt, whole experience was just wow, well done chef & D6 will be back very soon - Thank yo
3
After rave reviews ...we went there for a late lunch...very lazy ppl started off on a good note that got over friendly and after giving menu said a no of dishes were not available....so finally we compromised on whatever they served.Food was great so we considered it to be just a bad day....so I went the next day again with a friend ...again food was good but service was lousy.So we thought of ordering instead of going in and finally the food that we did a take away was good but in such small portions that we gave up on the thought of ever going there
5
I was on a holiday to Singapore and had a sudden craving for kebabs and the typical North Indian food. My friends studying there decided to take me out for dinner to Delhi 6. The Burrah Kebab was absolutely amazing and is a must try. Haven't had something like that even in India. It took some time for the food to come, but I guess best things come to those who wait! Overall a very very good experience. Definitely going back there on my next vacation!!!!
5
I have been eating at restaurants claiming to serve Mughlai/NWFP cuisine for many years across the globe but this place was a very palatable surprise. Most of these places serve commercial, run of the mill food without knowing much about the history of the food or the right way to prepare it. My visit to Delhi 6 left me with wanting more. I experimented with both Veg and Non Veg items on the menu and the food, the service and the attention to details were outstanding
4
Best kebabs I have had in Singapore so far (been here nearly 3 years). Good service, they were prepared to do a little extra for us as we had children (not as spicy) Kids would like to give it a 5... The Mrs a 3.5 as she is a vegetarian and believes this is for meat lovers... Therefore I went with 4.
5
Some of the most amazing Kebabs that one can find in Singapore. Loved the Burra kebabs, Dal Makhani n Butter Chicken. Was here on its first day and since visiting almost every Saturday. Fantastic team 😊
5
Loved this place. Everything we ate was amazing. Would definitely recommend trying their lamb kebabs - so tender!
5
Dear Food Lovers
I strongly recommend to try different types of Kebabs @ Delhi 6.
Specially - Murg Achari Tikka, Chandi Murg Tikka and also special Masala fresh lime soda.
Next time I will try their Biryanais and Curries.
Regards
Jack
5
Loved the kebabs and the food. A real treat for someone who wants to venture into authentic Indian food.
5
Loved the kebabs at Delhi 6, especially the Tangri kebab. Authentic food and great service. Will definitely be back!
4
A newly opened Gem - a place worth going too- the best Romali roti- and kebabs in town- will try the Biryani and curry next time!
5
After trying quite a few "Indian" restaurants and failing miserably to satisfy myself in getting authentic Indian food..I tried Delhi 6 yesterday (which was my B'day) and the food was amazing..the Chandi Murg tikka, Butter Chicken and best of the lot the Gulkand Gulab jamun ...You made my day...After i made the payment, I was told by one of the staff member that I should have told them in advance that its my bday and my first visit..I could have got some complimentary stuff too .. I hope I can ask for the same on my next visit :PGood job guys..Keep up the good work.
4
We visited Delhi 6 with very low expectations and were pleasantly surprised by the authentic and aroma-rich Indian food we treated ourselves to! Their kebabs are best in the business! They don't have an exhaustive menu but whatever they serve leaves you wanting more! Besides the juicy and tender kebabs, I strongly recommend their unique pesto nans and spinach romali rotis! The bowl-shaped plates certainly needs a second thought as it was quite inconvenient to handle the rotis with gravy accompaniments. Overall a lip-smacking experience and I will certainly pay this place a few more visits
5
I have eaten around the world and I can say this was easily one of the best Kabab meal that I have eaten outside of India. The Kababs were juicy and nicely marinated and the Curries were flavorful. Nothing in the spices was overpowering.The food took just a bit longer to arrive, but I guess there is no quick way to Tandoori cooking. Service was friendly and attentive. I will definitely eat here in my next visit to Singapore
1
I normally won't write bad reviews, unless I have had a terrible experience, and a meal in this restaurant probably right up there (or down there !!)- When you turn up, all the staff avoid eye contact, incase you decide to come in and eat!! They are either busy cleaning the counter, or doing some mysterious activity on the till, while the customer waits at the door waiting to be seated and getting more frustrated by the minute- The guy who took our order did not have a clue either about the menu (A simple query like "is this dish dry or does it come in a sauce?" could not be answered), or the language which we were speaking, which admittedly, being English, might be slightly foreign !!- After taking help from another staff to place our menu the food finally arrived, and I must admit, the kebabs looked good- However the first kebab which was tried had human hair in it (YUCK); we should have got up and left at that time, but the staff was polite enough to apologise and change the entire platter- While still eating my kebabs as started, the waiter started clearing the table and serving main course (including clearing the starter dish that I was still eating!!) basic skills like (wait till the customer finished his starter before removing the dish and serving main course) do not seem to exist in this place- The other funny thing bat this place is that the dinner plates are not flat (they are kind of a shallow bowl) - so any curry you put in yr plate (which being Indian cuisine is unavoidable) rolls down to the centre of the plate and you end up having a curry mixture instead of individual dishesAnd it is not cheap!!Avoid as both the service and hygiene standards in the kitchen are questionable
