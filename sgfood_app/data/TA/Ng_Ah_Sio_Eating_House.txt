The dishes 肉骨茶is one of the best produced by this restaurant. All dishes are very yummy and fresh. The taste are so unique and the after taste is beautiful. The services is very good too. The restaurant is crowed and very clean.

The soup is over power with pepper which kills the taste of a good bak kut teh. The price is also slightly expensive.
Not my type of BKT

Have always wanted to try Singapore famous Bah Kut Teh. LIterally means Pork Spare Rib Tea. This time friends brought me to Ng ah Sio bah Kut Teh at Tanjong Katng Area. Their sitting is just wooden table and stool. The Bah Kut teh was great, with its peppery flavor and tender spare ribs. We also had tofu, vegatable, rice that came with it The tea served was also very tasty. Best of all, they also sells it in powder form that you can bring home for home cook, I got their bah kut teh and tea that I am still enjoying till now

My family loves to buy take-away bak kuk teh from this Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh Katong outlet @ Tanjong Katong Road.For SGD8.50 you get delicious strips of 1 tender premium spare & 1 pork ribs combo, which pairs beautifully with their dark broth which is infused with spicy seasoning and hearty herbal flavourings.We cannot get enough of their peppery goodness, and they kindly indulge our request for extra soup.You can get rice or fried dough fritters (you tiao) to accompany this Singaporean heritage dish.My mum also enjoys their vegetables such as blanched lettuce or blanched xiao bai chai. Highly recommended for a hearty bowl of pork rib soup, especially during cold rainy days.They are part of the JUMBO Group (including the famous JUMBO Seafood), and hence we are assured of consistent and very good quality Teochew Style bak kuk teh

This is no doubt one of the very best Bak Kut Teh served in Singapore. U will love the peppery clear soup base. Unlike those dark herb base soup which tense to have a strong herb smell. I will definitely prefer this traditional peppery soup. Price was reasonable too. A must try in Singapore.

I didn't realise Ng Ah Sio Eating House of Tanjong Katong Road is different from Ng Ah Sio Rangoon Road, until now, although I believe both serve similar food.Two friends and I decided to purchase a Groupon voucher to try out the Tanjong Katong shop. Besides the signature bak kut teh, we had pigs liver, small intestine, pigs trotters, braised peanuts and pickled vegetables - we really pigged out! I found all the dishes - except the bak kut teh - were all very good. The small intestine was worth a mention as it was nicely soft and well cleaned. The bak kut teh was actually a disappointment as it was lacking in flavour and the meat was not cooked long enough. Also it was mingy - with only 2 thin pork ribs in each bowl. We ordered tea to share. THe tea cups were annoyingly small, so you need to top it up after every sip and you also need to top up the kettle very often.It is a typical Chinese coffee shop set up with no frills, although there is some airconditioning. The bench and stools were very uncomfortable, not some place where you want to spend any longer than needed.We were there for an hour duirng which time there was no offer of top up of soup, not until we were about to leave. Service was non existent

For those who don't know much about pork ribs soup eating, imagine a delicious peppery broth with chunky meaty pork ribs floating in it. If that sounds good to you, then this is the place for you.In addition to lots of greens, sides, including pickled vegies, boiled peanuts, mushrooms, pickled eggs etc, there is also intestines, stomach, trotters and lots of other delicious pork products.There is no alcohol served here, so its a quick hot dinner with a tea or a lime juice, then on your way..Its a taste sensation
