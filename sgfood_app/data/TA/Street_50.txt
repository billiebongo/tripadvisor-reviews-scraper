Was there to try out the Indomie Special after seeing videos of it. The food was average. Cleanliness can be maintained better.
4
variety was ok. seafood on ice, diy rojak, otak, sambah prawns were good! satay meat is a bit tough.
gado gado rice is too hard for my liking. rest of the food is just ok
1
Overpriced less than average food. Lamb pilaf was dry. Grilled oysters were shrunken and dried. Very disappointing.
2
Forgettable. Had an absolutely underwhelming meal with a few good friends. We ordered 5 dishes from the ala carte menu and we found everything to be sub-par.
5
Excellent choice for an hour lunch. Sufficient selection of lunch sets. Awesome free flow of appetizers and desserts. Most important the staffs were so polite. We feel so at home!
4
Very affordable rate n no regrets. Will comeback again to try the live barbeque. Service was good. The Indonesian food are variety n I was spoilt for choice.
5
Flavours of the dishes as homecooked authentic and it gets. Ample parking. It felt like I was back in Bali/Jogjakarta/Jakarta. This places gives all Indonesian restaurants in SG a run for their $. Super good food and good price!
4
Great services and fantastic food. If only there were less bugs flying around. Food selection is sufficiently good and taste is authentic.
3
We ordered from the ala carte menu and went for the chef suggested dishes. The dishes are at most average and do not taste authentic Indonesian food.
3
The service was good, but the food was really average. It is taste more like Malay food than Indonesian cuisines.
4
Even though selection was limited, the taste was good. For the price we paid, i think it was worth it.
3
The food was average with a couple of dishes good, a couple that were bad and most of them were average.
4
Not the tastiest of Indonesian cuisine. The Bali satay was good though the tahu telor was rather disappointing. Service was also slow, waited nearly 45 minutes before the food arrived. Restaurant was not even packed at that time.
3
Average spread for hotpot buffet. Service decent and rather helpful. Last table to be seated when we arrived at 7.15pm. Mostly families with kids all around.
2
Saw the big advertisement on their executive lunch therefore decided to give it a try but asam fish head was like a pot of sour fish soup, sambal prawn has no taste of sambal, and the rice was hard like not cooked.
4
The layout of the restaurant was decent although the cushioned high backed sofas were too low for comfortable tucking-in your meals. We opted for Ala Carte instead of the buffet and the menu list was great with items not normally found in other establishments, e.g. Empek2 Palembang. The service was somewhat tardy during our visit though. Nonetheless, it was quite a pleasant dining experience and prices were relatively fair for the Ala Carte
4
It was our first time to dine in Rumah Rasa. I saw the Facebook post circulation for the 1-1 weekend dinner buffet. Booked online and sent an email to confirmed my reservation. The food offered by Rumah Rasa is nice. Mostly the cooked food was delicious. The BBQ squids I prefer to be marinated and BBQ instead of BBQ the squids and pour the sauce over. Overall, The squids tasted delicious. The staff and their services was good. The ambience was cozy and romantic. Overall my friends and I were satisfied with the food and service by Rumah Rasa. Will definitely recommend Rumah Rasa to friends and families.

Dear Tourists, if you happen to stay at Bay Hotel want to have a quick meal. I suggest you walk over to VivoCity. The hotel pot buffet they serve isn't worth paying $42++....I was totally disappointed with the spread they offered. 2 dishes of cooked side dishes; luncheon meat and wrapped dumpling. And a few grilled dishes; prawn, chicken and corn. The rest of the dishes for the Hotpot is very limited.I had miso soup base, while my friend had beef. it's so salty that we have to drink water nonstop.Service staff is friendly.Unfortunately, I'll not return
3
Went on a sunday dinner. price was 42++ but had 1f1 voucher. considering the 1f1 voucher price, it was considered average value for money. Food was generally okay, with nothing outstanding. Hotpots design were unique and nice, but the design while nice to look at wasnt exactly practical and resulted in long cooking times, not that it matters since there is no time limit.Service saves the day as staff and very helpful and attentive.In summary, this place is okay if you have a 1f1 voucher, else there maybe other better food options at the original price
4
We stayed at the Bay Hotel so decided to eat here on our 1st night and I'm glad we did. The food is excellent and although the wine is pricey it is like that everywhere in Singapore (perhaps that's why you never see drunkeness in the streets as you do in the UK). Outside area is quite noisy but didn't bother us too much, we ate inside then took drinks out. Staff are very polite and helpful, we would definitely eat here again
3
Whilst Street 50 is part of the Bay Hotel, you can use if from outside as well. It is a pleasant courtyard, but nothing fancy.
5
The food was excellent for Chinese New Year, we were there before it started and stayed all the way till it closed. The food was so good and worth it!
4
Service staff very friendly and helpful. Variety of food good value for money. Taste of food average. Great place if you are not very particular about having excellent food
4
Christmas Buffet Menu Food item was average. Service and atmosphere was good. Amount of choice is decent
1
One of the worst dining experience.. food was bland and live stations were short of supply.. took a long time before food were replenished
3
Food spread was mediocre. Taste was alright thou. Took advantage of the 1 4 1 Christmas promotion. Saving grace was the attentive service provided as I had an elderly in the group.
2
Went for a Sunday buffet brunch. Price is 42++ and reason we went is that we had a 1for1 voucher. Without that it would have been a pretty disappointing outcome. Food is ok but nothing rave about. Point is that you can get this significantly cheaper, in particular when going with a few people. For this kind of money there are much better options.
5
Happen to stumble upon promo for this hotel buffet,and since this is our first time; we came with no expectations.First menu I tried was beef BBQ, very surprisingly the meat was quite tender and very well marinated. The best part was the BBQ master even offered us to grill a fresh one despite there are some ready at the tray.The laksa is quite great as well as other cool food.If.one thing may be able to improve slighly is the freshness of cold seafood dish.Other than that, great experience Street 50 @Bay Hote
4
The spread is not so much, but since the price is at the low side, there is not much that we can complain. The plates were not cleared promptly. I guess it was due to a wedding reception going on in the buffet area as well. Overall, cheap buffet if you are not particular about the quantity and quality
3
Came here for the Boxing Day buffet 1-4-1 promotion which averages about $33 per pax after ++ - a steal for Boxing Day family dine out! The spread was rather varied despite a limited display area - there was cold seafood including oysters, cold apps, hot dishes, breads, soup, and xmas-y desserts. There was even a bbq and pasta station in the alfresco area.Quality was middling although I had no complaints given the price I paid. Service was quite good with plates being cleared fast and water refilled timely as well.No crowds at all given it was a public holiday. Parking coupons was available for dining guests too. I wouldnt pay the ful price for it though. But this first visit was not too bad
3
We had the hotpot buffet. The waiter forgot our soup base till we reminded him. The buffet spread was pretty limited. I will probably visit elsewhere if I want to eat hotpot buffet in the future.
4
We went under UOB one for one promotion. It's was a very good deal. Although the food varieties are not that great, but good quality is there. Like the satay, naan, BBQ prawn
4
open and covered dinning, awesome and testy food, friendly and good staffs, bit expensive, located in good area...
3
Understand it is a four star hotel but the quality of the food can be improved. The foods are not fresh. The service men are not putting up a smile to serve the customers.
2
Dungeon or restaurant ...very dark and enclosed....food is ok. Service staff is nice and attentive....chaos in mornings
4
The price was reasonable and the food was not as bad as I was expecting. Service was really good and it was very clean. Cheap Beer too.
4
The fastest way to reserve seats and have wide choices to choose from. Resturant received my booking.
3
Visited this restaurant for my family dinner on Sunday wanting to try out their hotpot and BBQ buffet.First impression, restaurant is very small and sittings are close together. Anyhow, allocated a table right at the corner. Service wise, pretty impressed especially a server by the name of Wei Wen. Food wise, pretty mediocre. Tried the beef and it was very rubbery and tough after cooking them in the hotpot. The buffet table states "sliced beef knuckle" which I believe was the reason for its toughness. The rest of the items are typical steam boat items. The miso broth which I had was good and they served big tiger prawns and I believed that was the only bright spot of our visit
4
Seafood Steamboat buffet with nice ambience. Service is great with staff prompt to clear used dishes. Only water is provided but other drinks are chargeable. Ingredients are fresh and variety is decent. Plenty of sauces to choose from. Fire source on the other hand took a while to boil the soup.
4
It was too far to go to another eatery so, as I was there for a short time it was not feasible to go to another area. Just for information, there was an excellent bus and rail service nearby but I chose to eat in house
2
Reached restaurant around 9pm, not much food choices left. It was stated that the restaurant for dinner will served till 11pm, and supper menu will ends at 3am. But nothing much was left when we are there.
2
Very little variety and choice. Service very slow and drinks are not included. Noisy and not value for money.
4
Only tried the breakfast buffet here.
Pretty decent spread - combination of local and continental fare.
5
Fresh ingredients and flavourful food. Service Crew took initiative and was very attentive. They were able to provide great recommendations when the item we wanted was not available that day.
2
Food and soup were average. Pot was in a bad condition. Where there is some rusty on the cover of the pot
3
Limited selections but it wasn't a bad thing as we could try a bit of everything. Overall, mediocre standard with more misses than hits. Also, the food spread was quite sweet in general which was a pity because the sweetness had sort of overwhelmed the original taste of the spice pastes for some of the dishes. It would have been much better if the chefs had gone easy on the sugar. We are unlikely to return
1
Before i start badmouthing the food, I must first commend the excellent service rendered by the servers. They are attentive and very courteous. The only fresh food you are going to get are the veggies and noodles. The premium platter is either a big joke or embarrassment. The beef and pork were grey and you can forget about the small bamboo clams and mini sea cucumber. On the buffet spread... the meats were better than the premium platter. The pork and chicken look the best among the meats and seafood. The prawns when cooked.... we're mushy and broke into pieces easily. Enough said.... I seriously hope the servers should start looking for new employment elsewhere. One Caucasian couple ordered burgers and they actually returned them and switched to the hotpot buffet. I am sure they regretted the move.

The restaurant was located at the first floor of Bay Hotel Singapore, which was just across the street from VivoCity Shopping mall. There was both outdoor alfresco dining, and indoor air-con dining area. When we stepped in the restaurant, it looked another hotel restaurant with buffet counter in the centre. The place was surrounded with cozy booth seating at the sides.Starting from 3 June 2016, the restaurant is offering a new all-day dining menu called Great Singapore Savour. Free Fresh Coconut Malibu for dessert and plus a chance of winning to win hotel stays and more with minimum order of $50 from the new menu (from 3 June till 14 August during the Great Singapore Sale period) .Salted Egg Lava Chicken Breast ($9.90)Cordon Bleu inspired deep-fried chicken breast with chefâ€™s homemade salted yolk paste.An east meet west dish. A great idea. It looked great being golden brown with crispy crust. But when sliced opened, the salted yolk paste failed to flow out smoothly. The chicken tasted slightly more on the dry side. I wish that it could be more moist with a more in depth savoury filling.Cereal Prawns with Wasabi Dressing ($9.90)Deep-fried crispy prawns spiced with cereal and served with wasabi dip.It was a typical zi char dish. The wasabi dip was more like a normal mayonnaise dip with wasabi taste barely there.Shrimp and Eggplant Sambal ($8.90)Local eggplant with fresh shrimp stir-fried with spicy sambal.It was the smallest serving out of all the dishes served tonight, yet it was the first dish to wipe clean by everyone. One even half decided on getting a second serving. The sambal was the thing which gave this dish the kick. It was spicy, sweet and savoury at the same time. Even with just plain rice, it was great.X.O. Scallop & Prawns Fried Rice ($9.90)X.O. fried rice with prawns and scallops wrapped in egg skin.It was served as fried rice in omelette parcel, similar to Nasi goreng pattaya which was commonly found in malay hawker stalls. It tasted quite flavourful.Claypot Assam Fish Head ($18.90)Fish head simmered in assam gravyInterestingly the gravy was not the usual spicy and sour type. Instead it tasted slightly sweet and light, without much spiciness. The fish head was meaty and moist.Fresh Coconut Malibu ($8.90)Fresh young coconut fruit with parisienne of mixed fruits, topped with coconut ice cream and accompanied by fresh coconut juice.It was interesting to have the fresh coconut served with its flesh untouched and shaped like a cup. The ice cream was rich and creamy, balanced nicely with the fresh juicy tropical fruits such as dragonfruit.Overall the food was delicious and reasonable priced. Although located so near to the busy Vivocity Shopping mall, the place was not crowd and offered a relaxing feel

We returned late from a very long day to be welcomed by the most hospitable staff. They were very attentive and caring through out our entire experience and we were very lucky to be served by their Service Champion. The food was delicious and there wasn't a very long wait between each course so we were able to enjoy the ambience. The food portions are medium to generous quantity but don't waiver from quality. It's conveniently located at the street level of the Bay Hotel so it was always an easy commute to walk across the road to Vivocity after breakfast. Thank you for your service, we will return on our next Singapore holiday.

Went for the weekend hotpot ala carte buffet.the experience wasn't really good. The premium platter did not seem too premium, and what was advertised was that it came with Kurobuta pork and wagyu beef but these were not available. The rest of the food that came did not seem fresh either. and the concept of having small individual hotpots that require frequent gourmet wick changing did not seem practical. Spent a lot of time waiting for the water to boil.On the other hand, the waiters and manager were really nice people
5
The vegetables platter was amazing and it's not just vegetables. There were other hotpot items included. For the price. . It's very affordable. 😊
4
The staffs in the restaurant are more polite than the hotel staffs. Hot Pot Dinner is great, had 50% discount as in-house guests. Wide variety for hotel breakfast, could have been better to have more local cuisine during breakfast. Keep it up!
5
was there on 7th Feb for dinner with my family.
very happy and satisfied with service. all staff very attentive to customer's needs.
Please extend my appreciation to the staff again for my experience.
The mini-steamboats are a unique concept that my kids enjoyed!
4
Was quite a good experience although the buffet line is small. But I like this kind of small buffet line which means crowd will be lesser and not so noisy.
4
Great food, especially Pizza Frutti di Mare, Garoupa Popiah & Veal Cheek Rendang. Attentive service provided.
4
Good customer service.. food is quite good. Atmosphere is good too. Overall, quite satisfied with it.

For this Easter Weekend from 25-27 MArch 2016, Bay Hotel Singpore's Street 50 Restaurant & Bar is eggcited to bring on a buffet lunch menu with some speciality egg dishes curated using the First and Only Pasteurized fresh eggs in Singapore from the N&N Farm and freshly laid qual eggs from Uncle William's quail farm. There will also be a showcase set up by Kranji Countryside Farmers Market to bring together local farmers and artisans to celebrate Easter together with a local twist.1. Combination of Chinese Cold CutsA common sight at wedding banquets would be the cold dish, but Street 50 has changed it up a little with adding Deep-fried quail eggs, along with favourites such as jellyfish, marinated octpus, prawn salad and spring rolls. As a quail egg lover, it was a delight to see my favourite tiny eggs deep fried.Combination of Chinese Cold CutsThe spring rolls were pretty filing despite it's size. One spring roll and I was full, I attribute it to the thickly wrapped spring roll skin. The octopus were generous in size and well marinated, with a sweet aftertaste. The jellyfish was just right for me. It had a slightly chewy, and crunchy bite in every mouthful.2. 62 Degrees boiled Egg with Chicken EssenceI really liked this creation. It is a soft boiled egg in the center and surrounding it is steamed egg, all of this goodness topped off with chicken essence! And everyone knows about the health benefits of chicken essence from BRAND'S.STREET50 is proud to partner with N&N to provide pasteurized egg during this Easter buffet experience. Unlike typical eggs pasteurized eggs requires alot of R&D in the millions of dollars and it requires submerging them into boiling water to kill all forms of bacteria. Hence, you see the colour difference of the egg white, in comparison to the normal eggs. It is more evident in a black coloured bowl. But the outside, it is difficult to guess which is a pasteurized egg. You can only tell once you have cracked it open!But having said this, with pasteurized eggs, you can be more at ease, with eating a soft boiled egg. There are lower chances of getting any digestive problems as most of the bacteria has been killed off before the egg was even cracked open. I do know of friends who are unwilling to eat soft boiled egg, due to the fact that it is still partially raw.Pasteurized eggs contain Omega 3,6 and vitamin E. They are also lower in cholesterol and you can look forward to a healthier and more nutritious Easter Buffet!The BRAND'S essence gives a very strong and appetizing aroma to this simple but delightful starter. This dish will be made available at the Pasteurized Egg Live Station where you can also get omelette cooked in truffle oil, sunny side up or scrambled eggs as well.3. Potato Salad with Pommery MayonnaiseA potato salad dish with quail eggs. Not the most exciting dish, but I loved it nonethteless. The mayonnaise was spread consistently throughout the entire salad. The blend of spices in this salad, certainly brought out an aromatic fragrance which was a delight to my palate as I would usually skip heavy carb dishes like this.The hard boiled quailed eggs tasted fresh and firm with a chewy mouthfeel. In my humble opinion, I personally felt that the quail eggs subtly complement well with the potato salad.4. Braise Tofu with Crabmeat and Egg WhiteA typical chicken dish with a twist. The nutritious sauce made with crab meat and pasteurized egg white was braised for hours to achieve this consistency. In addition, the crab meat were seen in chunks, that tasted fresh. I really loved the thick and flavourful sauce with its savoury crab meat and tofu. The texture of the tofu was done right for me and neither too soft nor too firm.5. Scotch EggI've only had scotch eggs 3 times in my life but this was a slightly different experience from the other two. The eggs seemed drier and could stay attached to the bread crumb layers, which made it difficult for me to eat it. Served with a mustard sauce, it was difficult to dip it into the sauce without losing either the bread crumb layer or the egg in the saucer. The bread crumb layer wasn't crispy and was rather doughy on the inside.7. Sambal Prawn with Quail EggSambal Prawn with Quail EggI've never seen sambal prawns served with egg, but that doesn't mean they don't go well together. This was an aromatic sambal, flavoured with a belnd of spices. The prawns encased within were fresh and juicy. The essence of the sambal could be tasted in the entire dish, even the eggs.I could easily detect the spiciness of the sambal so this wasn't the dish for me. But it depends on each individuals' threshold for spiciness. This combination was surprisngly good, in my opinion. It is definitely worth the try

The 4 of us reserved a table for dinner.Best to make a reservation as the place does not have that many tables inside.Although there are more tables outside, I do not think you would want to be "steam-boating" in the humid weather :(Each of us were provided with a glazed ceramic pot with fuel below for our personalised steam boat, called "hot pot" dinner.There was a choice of soup flavours including beef, tom yum or chicken.The spread wide sufficiently wide for us.It included prawn, bamboo clam, cured sotong, sliced grouper fish (very tasty), sliced pork, chicken, beef, lamb, liver, "balls" (fish ball, pork ball, sotong ball, foocheow ball-with minced meat inside), vegetable (tang oh, cabbage, lettuce), mushrooms (inoki, button), a few bean curd skin based items, white rice, noodles, egg, taufu, etc.The spread included fried spring rolls and peking duck, while you wait for the soup to boil.Food is always topped up, a continuous flow.There is also fish meat wrapped up in (what felt like tracing paper) into a cone .. like how bakers press decor onto their pastries. I tried "squeezing" the fish paste into the soup & voila ... I get soft tasting fish meat in my soup, which was already enriched as a result of cooking all sorts of stuff.Iced and warm water is provided on complimentary basis.Should you start to "run out" of soup, the serving staff will gladly top up.With a comfortable ambience and a quiet corner, we enjoyed our leisurely dinner to the max :)Oh .... if you noticed, I had indicated "Yes" to dining on a budget & "Value" rating of 4.By that I mean that I dined on a deal.com voucher at SGD$28 (nett) per pax for 4. Without any discount, it's SGD$38++ per pax
5
weekend buffet spread was good although not really wide selection, each dish is prepared fresh and very tasty. The seafood is fresh especially the prawn which were large whether fresh or cooked in sambal chilli. The chilli curry chicken and sea cucumber were very tasty. Satay is very flavourful.The dessert spreas was decent with local fare like kueh kueh. The fruits and ice cream were good too

Menu on Chope and the menu at the restaurant are different.The restaurant is noisy, not just from the patrons but there was a lot of noise from the bar/kitchen (not sure what the staff were doing back there, a lot of loud clings and clangs); the staff moved tables and chairs by dragging them on the floor which made a lot of noise; when they changed/cleared the dishes and buffet there was again a lot of noise. Overall, it does not have a conducive environment to enjoy dining.We asked the waiter to give recommendations on pasta and he glanced at the menu, smiled and said everything is good (that helps). We ordered pasta and the tomato basil penne with bacon is so awful that my friend only managed to down two mouthfuls. The spaghetti with arrabiata sauce and vongole was ok but nothing to rave about.The half dozen escargots was served by pouring one pac of alcohol (not sure which kind) and set ablaze. It sure looks good but when we tasted it, there was so much alcohol it was chocking. I believe they would have tasted better without the alcohol.The staff are friendly and they provide good service, but I think they should be mindful of how they handle the pots and pans, tables and chairs. The restaurant is already very noisy with all the chitter chatter and kids crying.
