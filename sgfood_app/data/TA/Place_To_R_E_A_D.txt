Great food especially the salad and pizza. But the wait staff from phillipines are too loud and annoying.

A good place to de-stress with friendly staff and cool atmosphere. Average pricing for beverage and liquor. 4th time to visit due to friendly staff.

This is a great spot if your close to little India to get some down home American style comfort food with world flavors. The drinks are a little spendy for my liking, but when it's that hot out you need something cool to drink. The pizzas are big and good, the apps were ok, the sausage plate was great, stay away from the nachos. The service was top notice and just a great spot to have dinner, I don't think they open till 4p

If you're looking for a Greek place for dinner over a bottle of beer, then Place to R.E.A.D is the perfect spot. Situated just opposite POMO and 3-5mins walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT this place is very convenient. I went here a few days ago with friends and I must say, this is one of the best few greek restaurants here in Singapore!We ordered Moussaka, Grilled Stuffed Squid with Feta Cheese and Beef Souvlaki.Moussaka - this dish is my favourite among all the dishes that we ordered. Oven baked casserole with grilled eggplant that is cooked perfectly with oozing creamy cheese on top that is so hard to resist. And if you dig down deeper then you will find minced beef that fits perfectly with the cheese and eggplant.Grilled Stuffed Squid with Feta Cheese - it's a grilled squid with feta cheese stuffed inside. The balsamic vinegar topping sauce blends well with this dish, it's definitely my favourite food to eat with beer.Beef Souvlaki - a skewers with veggies and a tortilla wrap (just like roti prata, yum!). This dish is very filling and good for sharing.Average price of each dishes is around $22 which is pretty decent for a greek cuisine that is very hard to find in Singapore.Will I come back again? Definitely yes and I will order the Moussaka again

Greek food is not commonly found in Singapore. And they can be rather expensive. I was in the Dhoby Ghaut vicinity one evening and popped in this hidden Greek restaurant after work. They had a great happy hour promotion, where the second glass of draft beer was only $1! Beer choices wise, they had several options on draught: Stella Artois, Hoegaarden and a rather unique Hoegaarden Rose. The last had a reddish pink tint and mildly sweet taste, which will appeal to ladies. I had the Stella Artois, which was nice and refreshing. We each got a beer and promptly ordered some food to go with the beer. We ordered the following:- Moussaka: Looks like a lasagna. The aroma of the grilled cheese definitely made me salivate. Essentially, itâ€™s an oven-baked casserole of grilled eggplant, minced beef, creamy cheese and spices. My friends went at it and soon it was gone. It was yummy! - Grilled feta cheese-stuffed squid. Two whole squids stuffed with feta cheese and grilled. The balsamic vinegar dressing paired well with the squid. To enjoy it best, eat it while it's hot. - Beef Souvlaki. Grilled beef skewers served with tortilla wrap, Tzatziki sauce and salad. Nice thick cubes of beef which went well with the yoghurt sauce. The tortilla reminded me of prata, which made me crave for curry.  The food went well with beer, and we had several rounds to round up the meal. With the cool weather we are experiencing in December, it is great to dine and chill outdoors

The women's pick Hoegaarden Rosee! A sweet refreshing fruit beer that is perf for the night. Prefer my beers on tap, and they have it here!Great atmosphere and I had my dinner here as well. The lamb shank was awesome, braised in red wine, super flavourful and tender. Recommended chill out place

Location- Nearest will be Dhoby Ghaut station or Bras Basah Station. 5 to 10 minutes walk for each.Drinks- Had a Jamaican rum and a Macallan on the rocks. Wasn't that good with the rum as it appears that they are more generous with the coke. Food rating is the drinks rating as we didn't have food.Service- Staff was generally friendly and they will openly tell about their promotions without prompting.Value- $12 onwards for cocktails. Ours were $12 and $16. Theres a service charge. Funng thing on the bill was a cof, T && Water open charge of $1. Didn't get to ask as I saw the receipt only when we left the place

Staff were efficient and super friendly. I ordered an ice tea and a Pizza then a beer. Very tasty and average pricing, nice little place in a nice location and stays open till late, was there until 3 as was no point sleeping as my transfer was collecting me at 6 for my aeroplane. Locals were also very friendly and invited me to the table (I was by myself) and there was also a nice cat to pet so felt right at home.Would definitely go back again one day.Also next door were a couple other bars one was called LOL (life of liquor) and FML that did karaoke, would def cruise on to those ones next time too as love the names. hah

Was there yesterday evening, 03 June 15 for dinner with a friend. If you're driving, chances are the limited open-air lots along Princep Street would already have been taken up and you may have to park at the multi-level car park along Bencoolen Street and walk through the alley which will bring you directly this dinning and drinking outlet. We chose to sit outside (Alfresco) in spite of the humid weather, reason being the inside is too cramp and small with only a few seating tables. We ordered the popular Cod-fish with a pint of Hoegaarden (sweet) blend which is light and refreshing but more of a lady's drink since it taste like shandy to me. The cod fish however, was succulent and tasted delicious! Soft chill-out music was playing throughout our dinning experience as we watch the working world drift past after their office hour and the last-light dwindles out .....The bill size was about S$100 for 2
