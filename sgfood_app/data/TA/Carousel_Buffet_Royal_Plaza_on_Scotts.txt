Decent selection of Japanese, Indian, Chinese and Western dishes. Lots of dessert choices with cakes, chocolate fountains and ice-creams.

Good variety of food. Love the desserts!
They suprised us with a cake to celebrate our wedding anniversary and daughter's birthday. Friendly staff.
5
Wide spread and food taste were excellent. From Singapore local food, to indian cuisine and western. The seafood quality was great and fresh. Service staffs were at their best service.
Delicious variety of desserts. Just heaven.
4
Quite an extensive spread of food for diners to choose from. Plates were cleared very timely as staff was attentive round the clock.
Would be nice if there were at least a few types of cold beverages to choose from.
5
Good food but dinning time a bit rush for lunch (1.5 hrs only as I only reach at 12:30pm). Please give more time for client.
4
A bit too crowded to some liking. But nice buffet spread.Seafood,cold dish,fondue and many more. Lively and attentive staffs.

The dinner buffet at Carousel had many options to choose from. It was fun to try foods that I was not familiar with. The food was good, but not great. Most of the lobster, crab, and shrimp were overcooked and tough. The best part of the meal were the desserts. The meal was kind of expensive for the overall value
4
I have heard a lot about this place as a choice for buffet-wannabes. To be truthful, it's not bad but not mind blowing. The quality of food can be better. Variety wise, it's okay but it's inclined towards Asian cuisine like Japanese, Chinese, Indian. However it's worth to mention that the wide variety of ice creams and waffles were a comfort. Went with a group of colleagues and were given a private room. The space was tight and with the heavy utensil holders, we barely had sufficient comfy space to manoeuvre around with our food.It's worth a try, but I won't be back soon
4
The ambience is good with friendly staff. However the food could be better if the soup based items are hotter. Green bean soup, laksa and oyster noodles are only lukewarm. There were quite a number of people who celebrated their birthdays there, including me. The staff did a special song and dance item and we enjoyed ourselves that day.
2
Consumers pay for the Halah label. Overprice high tea has a reasonable spread. Their dessert counter are their only worth going for. Forget about coffee, they serve self service Nescafe coffee / hot beverages.
4
Lots of variety, different cuisine options, all halal, good amount of seafood. Desserts were the stand out
Excellent service, would reccommend
4
The variety of choices are quite limited I would say. However, the service was really good. Overall, can give it a shot if you have not try. This is my 2nd time having halal buffet & its way better than my previous experience.
5
Had my birthday celebrated here with my fiancèe. Good food and good service, thank you! There is a prayer room nearby in the hotel premises for ease of mind while having good food😋
5
Love the different choices of dishes. Food is fresh. Love the dessert corner. This place is always crowded. One of my favourite buffet restaurant to go to.
5
It was a wonderful lunch dine in. Staff are very responsive to us and they really did a good job in surprising my cousin for her advance bdae
4
I was there for the high tea on my birthday and it was a pleasant experience. The seafood selection is very fresh and my favorite would have to be the cold prawns. The sashimi section is also another highly recommended area. Not able to comment on the cooked food as I did not try it
5
We went there for our Dad's birthday celebration. And the best part about this place is they have a halal-certified menu!! Believe me, it is hard to get such a dinner buffet place which is muslim-friendly. Had lots of food from western to indian, ice - cream with waffles to cakes and pastries. Not forgetting Japanese and seafood as well. Lovely ambience, friendly and quick service. They even had their staff do a short performance for birthday girls/boys. And a slice of cake is presented to them as well. This is our 2nd time here. Will definitely look forward to more patrons.
5
The breakfast was certainly much better than in 2016 when I last stayed at Royal Plaza. The cooked breakfast was actually warm this time whereas it was cold the previous occasion. There is a wide selection of food from Western breakfast, continental breakfast and Chinese noodles cooked to order. I had a tasty omelette cooked to order. I also had nice, crispy hash browns, and grilled tomatoes and chicken sausages. There is a wide selection of fresh fruit as well as cheese and biscuits. I ate too much
5
I could not be more delighted with Carousel. Everything from their selection of food to their impeccable service made my Christmas eve enjoyable. They satisfied my craving for delicious rendang (just like my mum makes them), and gave me a lot more other options to try. I do wish their juices were fresh though but that doesn't stop me from giving them a 5 star rating for the excellent food
5
Wide variety of great tasting food with wait staff always around at your service. I still feel that the price is slightly steep.
4
Tq Carousel for the wonderful buffet. My family n i had a great time and most of all the food of marvelicious! Thumbs up to the staffs who are always around to clear our plates n best desserts always!
5
We had an excellent meal. The quality was good as expected. And I couldn't ask for more. Service was good and we even had some staff dance entertainment.
5
I had my dad's and my birthday lunch celebration at Carousel. My family, friends and I had a very good time there. We were 9 adults. Carousel staff placed us in a private seating area, and so we had our own quiet space for eating and chatting. We even had a personal waiter, Pushpa, who was very pleasant and attentive to our needs. The waiters even had a song and dance items for all those who were celebrating their birthdays, and we got a cake too! The food was super yummy. We love the freshness of the seafood and the many different types of food items. We were surprised that a waiter came and took photos of our group, and the photos were promptly sent to my email. I am very impressed with the service, the atmosphere as well as the food. We really enjoyed ourselves very much. Thank you, Carousel!!

Why have I never reviewed Carousel before? Work and pleasure take me all over the world and Royal Plaza on Scotts is my favourite hotel. Just off Orchard Road, I've had breakfasts, lunches and dinners here - and have always been delighted. Fresh food, creative presentation, friendly yet not overbearing staff, what might appear to be 'open eating' can feel intimate and special. While being treated like royalty at the Royal Plaza, taste-buds get 'The Royal Treatment' too. I've never been bored by the array of choices, unlike many hotel buffets. Worth coming again and again
4
Carousel is a great place to organize lunch, afternoon tea and dinner gatherings for family/friends/office gatherings, especially if you have Muslim friends/associates in the guest list, then this will definitely one of the best venue to go to for buffet.They have many varieties of cuisines, such as Japanese, Chinese, Mediterranean, India, western, etc and there are live stations, including freshly baked nanns, popiah (no-fried spring rolls) which are my top 2 all time favorite, pasta, etc.Their hot dishes are generally delicious. Other than sushi and sashimi, I am not exactly a fan of cold seafood and hence, cannot make any comment on this area. Their cheese selection is very limited considering the price of the buffet.Desserts selection is not as wide as the mains but the choices are good enough as most of the time, you are already quite full when its dessert time.As this place is very popular, I would recommend that you make a reservation to avoid disappointment and request for a quiet-er corner as generally, the restaurant can be quite noisy
2
There is certainly a wide variety of food stations to choose from.However this place is noisy and seating uncomfortable.Moreover food quality, taste and appearance of dishes especially seafood leave a lot to desire and are not in line with the price paid.There is much better in Singapore for even less dollars
3
I guess I'm spoiled by the buffets here in Hong Kong so I felt a little let down by Carousel. Since it was highly recommended and listed among some of the best buffets in Singapore, I chose this for our last dinner in Singapore as it was literally around the corner from our hotel and it was pouring rain. While they offered a variety of different cuisines, I felt that the spread was still limited and didn't see a lot of the local cuisine being represented. While I indulged mostly on the seafood, my parents mentioned that they felt the quality and selection wasn't quite there. Service was a bit spotty (they didn't even offer us a drink menu and when asked, I still had to go up and ask them after waiting 10 minutes for it), they were quick to replenish the food and to clear our plates which was nice. For $72 SGD? Per person - I didn't think it was good value for money and should have just went across the street to the Grand Hyatt instead.

There was a wide variety of cooked food and seafood to choose from. Service was really good and staff is very friendly and helpful. Staff also clears plates very fast as compared to other buffets location i have been to. Location is very accessible and also the ambiance of the restaurant is quite good.Also, they had an interesting perk which was that they will sing to celebrate everyone's birthday while staff will hand out cakes to person(s) having their birthday celebrations. While singing isn't uncommon and they did not sing to that individual person, alot of the staff were involved so it felt very warm. The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is due to:It is more expensive than i remembered for a weekday night and for the cost, it feels slightly less worthwhile.Also, while it is not the fault of the restaurant or staff, the diners there tend to be very noisy and i wished it was less so

We organized a team gathering for our grassroots core leaders at the hotel restaurant. I made the booking with Ms Pinky and Ms Joyce. Both were very helpful with my booking. Ms Joyce helped me to reserve the private room so that we could held our gathering and team building away from distraction and the noise. Two days before this function, I attended a gathering at another hotel and had my buffet lunch at Aquamarine. The ambience was good in the sense that it was much more quieter but the variety of food is not as wide a range as that found in this Carousel restaurant and the replenishment is just instantaneous. The last time I came here was just a year ago and I wrote a review commenting that the standard had dropped but this time, I must say that the standard has improved tremendously. Every item was well-replenished. I like the salmon, tuna and the sashimi and the one preparing was fast enough to replenish before they are all taken up. The crab claw meat, the mini-lobster or crayfish, the red prawns were easily swept out but the attendants ensure that they are always well replenished. All of my grassroots leaders commented that the seafood were very fresh and they came for many servings. Also are the fruits section which consumed quite fast. I like the pineapples, they helped in the digestion and the attendant in-charge of the fruit section was very aleart to replenish the fruits. The laksa was very appetizing and most of my team members had a bowl and commented well on the dish and the preparation. I also fascinated the well cooked dishes at the Indian corner. The food looks very appealing. I must also commend on the service staff who came into the room to quickly clear our plates and bowls. They were very attentive and clear the table very efficiently. One of the counter guy even assisted us to take a group photograph outside the restaurant. This small little deed by your staff is commendable. I had a totally different perception of this restaurant this time from that of one year ago. It is imperative that I wrote a review to commend the good food and services provided. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff and the management for being so accommodative and service oriented. If you ask me to rate, I would rate this restaurant as the best of the restaurants I had frequented with the best abundance of varieties. We are sure to be back again

Good for social gatherings or company events. There were some hits and misses but overall a good balance of variety!
5
Wide range of food.
Nice ambience.
Seafood range definitely one of the best for halal buffet.
Desserts always a must. All out indulgence. No dieting 😋
5
Buffet selection was adequate, quality food and neatly presented. Highlights for me were the desserts and hot items. Service was wonderful and friendly as well. Thank you for wrapping up my Christmas meal!
4
Quite good spread of food. Location is near Orchard MRT. Staff are prompt in clearing plates. Was there for a high tea buffet to celebrate my friend's birthday and they threw in a complimentary slice of cake. Glad with the service. Would be better if there are more drink choices though
4
I went there for a Teachers' Day dinner with my colleagues and principal. I had heard good things about this place but did not really buy it as I felt that all buffets are ultimately the same.Boy was I wrong. The ambience itself is very cosy. The food options were honestly, better than most buffets. They even had a pasta station where you can choose what pasta you want.As I'm allergic to seafood, I did not venture to the seafood side. But I did briefly walk by the seafood area and was overwhelmed by the amount of seafood present! Truly paradise for a seafood lover
4
Carousel has always been the most talked about Buffet, but for me it didn't meet up to the expectation. The food choices could have been better i feel. Also, the desserts are not topped up as fast as it finishes. I think I have been to better buffet lines
5
Crew attitude begins from the top!That's what I can say about Mr Patrick Fiat, the General Manager of Royal Plaza, who is so ever friendly. This trait trickles down to all the staff. Every service crew, from the front desk, chefs, servers, and cleaning crew - all have given me the best impressions. Always positive, smiling, and courteous.The food spread is great, so much that I regret having such a small stomach to take in all the goodness!!
1
My son and I almost instantly suffered from a very acute diarhorrea. I believed it came from the hot dispensing machine as only my son and I drank hot tea and teh tarik respectively and only two of us have diarhorrea. Luckily my other family member and baby daugther are unaffected. Will proceed to polyclinic first thing tmr morning
5
Amazing experience! They do have dance presentation for Christmas and they sing a song for birthday celebrant. Wide varieties of food from seafood food on ice, cooked food and desserts. However, the place need some renovation i visited carousel way back 2011 and it’s looks elegant, need some touch up but service is good
3
Good spread but overrated. Ok to go once for experience. We celebrated one of our friends birthday during the high tea and honestly we are quite disappointed to be offered with just a slice of cake. Other 5star hotel would provide at least a 250gram cake. There are rooms for improvement
5
The food never disappoints us no matter how many times we went there! Beautiful ambience, great service & surrounded by friendly & cheerful staff... ❤ Thank You Carousel!
4
One of the local favourite halal restaurant for gathering and celebrations. All the waiters and waitresses are attentive and helpful. Many food varieties and fast refilling for most of the food counter, highly recommend for travellers too.
4
There are plenty of food to taste so take your time. Place is always full so do make a reservation before you drop by.
4
Great choices, great service. The number of stations offering a plethora of options is staggering. Get a table by the window and watch the world go by while you enjoy the different selections.
3
Went to have dinner with friends.
I didn’t feel anything is exceptionally good...just ok to get together with friends to chat over quick dinner.
Service was fine but if one looking for ambience, this is not the restaurant.
4
So far don't eat mutton don't have beef so sad didn't eat much as most of food expected what I want.
5
The buffet spread is good.Seafood is fresh and the ice cream flavors has an exotic variety. Was there in a group of 15 and the staff arranged a private room for us. Posh and cosy.
5
My friends thoroughly enjoyed our weekday lunch buffet at Carousel. It was not our first visit, and I must say that Carousel always serves fresh seafood. I especially loved the baby lobsters and slipper lobster (aka crayfish) as well as succulent prawn. Even the roast was delicious. Best of all was the ice-cream counter near the entrance: my favourite were the chendol, kaya and salted yolk gelato flavours which I ate with waffles. The cakes were also lovely and there's also yoghurt and chocolate fountain. I will always prefer Carousel!
4
Quite expensive but splendid buffet spread of various delectable food selection. Do make a reservation because this restaurant is a favorite among locals and tourists alike. Try to get seats near the buffet line or away from it to avoid many hungry patrons walking by your table or knocking into the back of your chair. The desserts are always a delicacy
5
Treated mum to lunch here. They have a wide variety of choices for you to choose from. The seafood are fresh on that day. Meaty crabs, lobsters, prawns, oysters, scallops etc. Laksa is good. Sushi is nice. Fried rice taste local and good. The dishes are great.As a halal buffet restaurant, I'll recommend everyone to try atleast once. Value for money. Service are efficient and most staff are friendly.Mum loves it. So, thumbs up
4
Great variety of food from sashimi, crayfish, crabs, scallop to prawns but no oysters. Lots of cooked food and dessert include fresh ice cream and popular cream bulee. Friendly and efficient staff who cleared our used plates fast.
4
Extensive menu, fabulous for overseas visitors to try a host of local dishes including Chinese rojak, popiah, chicken rice, kueh pie tee, nasi lemak. Desserts were lovely too! 2 chocolate fountains
5
Awesome buffet spread and thumbs up for all Carousel F&B service team to make this day memorable for me and my family!
Will definitely return..
4
the service staff, especially the seniors were professional and really made the difference. this time round the buffet spread was not to our existence though.
4
It’s my 1st visit to Carousel buffet dinner with my family for a belated birthday celebration.
It’s indeed great dinner we had and enjoyed the wide spread!
Average atmosphere but great food included hot beverages.
The restaurant was on full house even on a Thursday!
3
My friends and I went for high tea just last week. The last time I went there was a couple of years back. My friend had booked the place about a month ahead of time. When we got there, there were many people waiting outside as it was close to 3.30pm. We were only allowed in there when it is 3.30.The spread was great - japanese sushi and slamon sashimi, crab legs, prawns...as the starters...there was salad, popiah kueh pie tee, prata...basically rather international...there were also cooked dishes, braised beef...very much a late lunch. If you eat slowly, it also includes your tea time and dinner! The dessert spread was disappointing to me. Some cakes and kuehs were available. There were 2 chocolate fountains, fruits available. Service was not too bad. Clearing of plates was pretty fast. It was not extremely expensive, neither was it very cheap. But it fills your stomach
1
It’s an expensive buffet minus the good food. The only saving grace is the friendlier staff. If you need to sample Asian cuisine, or even western cuisine, this is not the right place. Spread is just average or below average. Spread of cheese is quite pathetic. Indian and Chinese food is below average. Dessert is below average. Spread of bread pathetic.. Of all the food, only the kebab and laksa is good enough to worth mentioning here.. the quality of food and the spread is just below average, even if the price is cheaper, it won’t be worth your time and stomach space.
3
Pros- great seafood spread - crab legs, lobster, baked salmon, mussels, fresh prawns- ice cream and waffles nice touch- sashimi was niceCons- prawns weren't fresh- roasted beef was too tough- very expensive for what you get. We paid $210+ for 3 people after discoun
5
The service staff were extremely wonderful and receptive from the very beginning when we were at the entrance and waiting to be seated. The variety of food was absolutely amazing, and definitely a value for money based on how fresh the seafood was. The crab, prawns and lobster were all very fresh and tasty. The waitstaff were also very receptive and took such great pride in doing their jobs, even if it was just refilling our drink glasses. We were definitely pleasantly surprised by the birthday performance that the waitstaff put up for the patrons who were celebrating their birthdays. A special shoutout to the staff who served and interacted with us - Adrian, Fadzli, Shaikh and Mathi, thank you for making our visit so wonderful and enjoyable! Our last surprise came when we scored a discount for dining, but would expire by end of the year. All in all, this is an excellent choice if you want a great spread of food (which is halal) and excellent service
5
It was definitely a great choice for the evening. It serves the best buffet in town from sashimi to steak to laksa and am array of pastries. The serving crew was polite and courteous, and a surprise little birthday cake for the occasion. It was a splendid experience and worth coming back again
5
Never disappoint me in every visit. Still the best Halal buffet in Singapore to me! Keep it up Carousel!!
4
There was a wide range of variety and the seafood was fresh. Service crew was prompt in terms of clearing plates each time we left the table, but service could be improved to refill water more promptly.
4
Myself and my hubby had a great time enjoying ourself w the halal buffet. Wide spread and food taste are excellent. Service staffs are at their best service. Looking forward to have another dinner back there. Thank you
4
Spent my mom's birthday celebration there had staffs coming out to perform and cakes for birthday babies! Nice and friendly staff! Attentive as well because it clears the plate fast. Food was okay dessert was good!!
5
From the services by its team members, to the buffet spread, this halal restaurant is the perfect place to go to for a great dining experience.Reuben, the team member who led us to our table offered to show us around the different food stations. Chef Zali offered his recommendations because I have strict dietary restrictions. He even came to my table to personally hand me a plate of butterfish as that was not yet available when I was at the buffet counter. Sharihah came around our table with her wide smile and great hospitality to take a birthday photo and presented us with a slice of cake. The food was delicious and service was prompt. Once again, I would like to commend Sharihah, Chef Zali and Reuben for making our dinner experience so memorable. We will definitely return.Bravo to all service staff
4
Quality of food is awesome. The variety for the dinner spread is mostly Seafood, Indian, Japanese, Mediterranean, English, Asian, Turkish. Seafood is really fresh and the meats are well cooked :)The dessert spread was alright, though chocolate used for the chocolate fondue fountain was abit bitter. Bread and butter pudding was divine!Plus service of the staff is excellent !
5
I realise now why this restaurant is so popular. From the services rendered by its team members, to the immense buffet spread, right down to the exciting birthday celebrations; this halal restaurant is the place to go to for great service, delicious food and wonderful surprises.As soon as my partner and I showed up at the entrance, we were swiftly shown to our table. The team member who led us in offered to explain the different food stations. If not for the fact that we have been to this restaurant several times before, we would have gone on the “tour”. Overall, the service rendered was excellent. Our empty plates were promptly cleared, despite how busy the restaurant was. The food was exceptional and they were well spread out. I especially liked how birthdays are celebrated here. The management has been quite ingenious and cost effective actually, as birthday celebrants are handed a slice of cake all at the same time after, like clockwork; the staff steps out of their buffet counters and perform a little song-and-dance for the patrons. We would like to commend Sharihah, Chef Zali and Reuben for making our dinner experience so memorable. We will definitely return
5
Food was awesome.! Their service was fantastic as well. Service staff was very initiative.We called in to make a reservation for 5 person and they asked if any one in our group is celebrating their birthday. Amongst us, there is one birthday girl so they even did a birthday performance.! Huge appreciation and kudos to all the staffs there. :
5
We had planned a surprise Hi Tea birthday celebration for my son today. This is our 1st visit. The staffs of Carousel surprise us with performance, birthday cake and songs. We enjoyed the food and like the atmosphere very much. Clearing of plates and replenish of food was very impressive. Looking forward to the next visit for lunch buffet....Thanks for the great service!!
5
Excellent buffet spread. The seafood and sashimi are fresh and delicious. The wide variety of food choices will offer something for everyone. Go with an empty stomach so you can try a little of everything. Save some room for the good selection of dessert. Book in advance as the restaurant is usually crowded
4
There's wide varieties to choose from, nice spread. However, if you are into durian puree, then have to go for the weekend ones and weekday ones do not offer that. Otherwise, food is generally tasty and it's halal so Muslim can also patronize.
5
It was a pleasure dining at Carousel! The superb spread of food, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff and the cosy ambience made the dining a great experience! Will definitely return again with my family :)
4
Great service and good food! They keep topping up the food and keep the table cleaned. Noticed they sing birthday songs for all birthday customers. Quite fun to watch...
2
Worst Indian food I have tasted in a Singapore Restaurant. It is a fake propaganda that Restaurant is Vegeterian friendly. Staff there is not sensitive to vegetarians.
Restaurant can accept guests at 1:30PM for lunch buffet but is absolutely inconsiderate while closing at 14:00 Hrs
5
Had my sister's birthday celebration on 19 Nov here. Food was great and tasty includes traditional local food like laksa, chicken rice. Food was replenished fast. Plates were cleared almost immediately. Food stations were organised well with little to no queue at stations. All staff sang birthday song and each birthday person was given a slice of cake. Good to go if you're celebrating a birthday. Oh and they have 20% off for major bank cards like uob citibank dbs n ocbc. Great work Carousel Team
5
I have experienced my solemnisation here. It is a wonderful experience. They gave us flowers n cake as a gift behalf of carousel. My family members n friends had a great experience here too. The food is awesome as always. I highly recommend here to anyone who wants to have a simple solemnisation. Excellent Job n Well Done to Carousel Team :
5
The place was packed but we were among VERY few non locals, which was a good sign. The place is not nearly as nice looking as some of the other buffets in Singapore, but there was lots of selection (many types of sea food, lots of dishes / various types of ethnic foods, lots of desserts). In short, if you're after a good buffet go there. If you are seeking ambiance go elsewhere
5
Great buffet spread with that will make you spoilt for choices. From Singapore local food, to indian cuisine and western. The seafood quality was great and fresh. The dessert station (especially the ice cream station) was fantastic. They have all kind of unique flavours from salted eggyolk, cendol, thai iced tea.Service was fabulous. Service crew was very friendly and attentive. Water was top up continuously without need to be request and plates were cleared efficiently. Guest celebrating birthday were also being presented with a birthday cake, song and dance.To wrap up the visit, they also send a photo of the visit for birthday guest (which is quite sweet!)
3
Buffet food selection was average. Plus point is that you can bring Muslim friends there. Ambience is cramped and crowded, not the least cosy - better for bigger groups. The saving grace was the birthday celebration whereby staff danced a mass routine and served birthday cakes to those who had made prioe arrangements
5
So far the best Halal seafood buffet I had in town. The seafood is always fresh and the warm dishes are awesome! The love visiting the restaurant during the fasting month as the spread is never a letdown except price may be a bit steep if going with big famil
4
Good varieties of food excellent service one of the many halal restaurant in the hotel industry thumbs up
5
The ambience is great and the food are awesome! Loved the fresh seafood and sashimi, exceptional steak, and delicious dessert.
5
Celebrated birthday party there, place is halal certified hence my helper is able to come along which was a bonus point for halal people. Variety of food was great except we had some raw oysters not very fresh. Overall was good
5
Great variety of food - cold seafood including fresh oysters (sweet and fleshy!); Japanese sushi and teppanyaki; Indian briyani and a wide selection of sides; Western, Chinese and Singapore favourites. I thoroughly enjoyed the Indian, Chinese and local dishes, which were as good as you'd get from any long-established local hawkers worth their salt.Save space for the spectacular range of ice-creams that come in all sorts of familiar and unusual flavours. Anything fried in salted egg yolk paste is all the rage in Singapore now, but have you had that in ice-cream form? :) Service is attentive and brisk even on a peak Saturday dinner time. Used tableware is cleared up the moment you leave your table for more food. Excellent!Brownie points to the Carousel team for the fun mass birthday song and dance. Every birthday boy, girl, man and woman gets a slice of birthday cake with a candle to blow out. And then a staff goes around to take a photo of the birthday boy, girl, man and woman with their loved ones. That photo is then emailed to the person who made the reservation online. It's the little thing that counts
3
Ive been to a lot of buffets. Dont understand why this is at the top of the list of reviews. Is it because of the location? Because food wise, nothing fancy, again is it abundance than quality that makes it good? Its just that nothing fancy for this super expensive buffet. Been here twice thou and would rather be at Sea and Blue, if you are really into a culinary adventure
4
My husband and I have dine numerous occasions here and we're never disappointed with the quality and variety of foods. To top it off the staffs are always so welcoming and friendly. It's always a pleasure to dine here and we'll be sure to return often
5
For an almost full array of food selections from seafood, western, asian to dessert, Carousel really packs a huge value for money, especially with the credit card discount of 20% for this year. My partner and I paid a nett total of about $150 (incl tax) and we were stuffed with favourites like lobsters, oysters, sashimi and steak.What struck us was the service provided. As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted immediately with impeccable courtesy at the door, and we were promptly shown our table. The most unforgettable experience was the birthday arrangement that the restaurant provided, with a dance by the crew and dedicated cakes served to the birthday patrons.It does not end there as Carousel actually took the effort to send us the photos they took (my partner and I were part of the birthday patrons) with a slight touch of customization. Is this service or what? ;
5
The dinner buffet at Carousel is awesome and absolutely delicious. If there is a rating upon 10, I would have given them 15/10. The food here is delicious and the seafood is fresh. You can know by the quality of the food here. By far, the best buffet restaurant in Singapore. They also entertain those having birthday dinners with their song and dance which I feel is a very nice gesture. The servers here are very friendly and informative. This is one restaurant that everyone shouldn't miss out.
5
Excellent service and wide spread of good fresh seafood. Never before had such fresh oyster and lobster at any buffet.We were spoilt for choices. The bread pudding were exceptionally delicious. Wide choices of dessert spread. The smell of fresh waffle in the air is very hard to resist.Staff were friendly, welcoming and warm. Thumbs up to the communication officer who handled the reservation.Will come back for sure!! :
5
At first this looks expensive for a buffet dinner, however if you are staying in the hotel you get 20% discount. This is not advertised anywhere, so was a pleasant surprise. This means two people dine for 143 Singapore Dollars.Then you factor in all you can eat seafood, lobster, crab and King Prawns.The selecting is incredible, I did not get to try everything, I could not eat another bit. There are stations from around the world.The sweets are amazing, the bread and butter pudding is the best I have ever had.The staff are pleasant and very efficient at clearing the tables and topping up your water.All you can drink tea and coffee is included.The selection of ice cream is fantastic.The buffet closed at 9:30pmI was there until just before it closed, this is when I took the photos
5
Wide spread of dishes -- Japanese/ Western / Chinese/ Indian. Good service. Free flow coffee/ tea from Nescafe machine.
The service was good too. Bring your POSB/DBS credit card, there is a 20% discount.
5
Everything is so prefect and nice. Worth the money. Good customer service. Seafood selections are all fresh!
4
This is a huge buffet that is efficient for breakfast and lunch...service was excellent and the food varied and very good
5
Another round of visit with friends to celebrate bachelor/bachelorette party for bride & groom to be. Perfect tea session. They love the buffet spread. Thank you to Mr Sara ( i hope i get his name right) and team did a wonderful job. Accomodate to request of complimentary cake,presented the balloons for my guest and complimentary photo. Thank you so much. I will definitely come back again

Have visited more than twice to celebrate special occasions and previously had excellent experiences, but this time the service and food were not up to expectation. Most of the counters were not fully topped up as if we are eating left overs; had to request for wipes as the table was poorly setup. Some staff were pleasant but not all, one even almost knocked over our plate as she was clearing our table

My wife and I went to the restaurant on Sunday 29th November for a dinner to celebrate our neighbor's birthday. This is not our first visit but probably the 6th. The name Carousel is already well known to people here in Singapore with its wide range of sumptuous spread and needless to say their Seafood cold dish. There is a new Ice Cream corner to our surprise. Is not just Ice cream but various types such as sorbet and yogurt. Luv it!The service was efficient as they always have. Hope to visit again in near future. Well done!

I’ve been here afew times mostly family occasions, its expensive cause its based on city area and also located in a hotel, but its worth the experiece, they have afew different cuisines, italian, muslim, indian,chinese food and few more and the best part that i really love is they serve lobster and also they have the best desserts! Would really love to come back for tea time.

I had my wedding at Royal Plaza on Scotts and decided to come again for a hi tea with my family. While the food is suited more for tourists who would like to try an authentic local dining experience, I applaud the efficiency of the banquet staffs. There were a wide spread of food. The staffs are attentive to your needs. This place is well suited for families who has grandparents, young children and big family. If you want a family friendly dining experience, this is the place to be. I love the choice of Cantonese food served. It is rare to get halal Cantonese food.

I don’t understand the hype of this place winning Best Buffets in Singapore, the food is ok. I would give 1 star for each item that was good - 1) Oysters 2) chilli crab 3) ice-cream. Everything else was mediocre. Ambiance was a bit chaotic, staff didn’t clear our plates, food was not replenished quick enough. Deserts all tasted eggy even the financiers. Cheese selection was terrible - they even had cottage cheese and feta for the cheese platter - so wrong. There are so many great buffet places in Sg, unfortunately this is not one of them
5
Nice ambience. Good food. Went there 5 times this year. 3 high teas, 2 dinners. I prefer high tea better than the dinner. Both have their own pluses. High tea have more drink variety and dinner have more ice cream selections. They have flavours like salted egg, thai milk tea, vanilla cashew, cheesecake, chendol and the list goes on. Their nasi lemak ( coconut rice) is marvellous. Topped it with the sambal paste (chilli) and it’s yummylicious. Carousel offers 20% off for certain credit cards sometimes. Do look out for their promotions on their website
4
Nice place! Pleasant and efficient staff! Great spread of good, but............. personally I don't like India food, for that corner, I skipped!
5
Great being with Family. Wide spread of food. Tasty. sure a must visit the place if you havent been there.
5
Wow, the food varieties are splendor. I loved the seafood section.. all my favorites are there.. surely will come back again with the family.
5
Great place to dine with family or friends. Love the ambience & service. Food are excellent. Will be back for more.
5
I will say this is the best Halal Buffet in town. Worth every cent of it.
Service is fantastic... buffet range is impressive. Do book in advance!
5
Buffet is well spread. We enjoyed celebrating my wife birthday there. Will recommend to come again. The people there are nice and welcome. Helpful even with bring along babies, toddlers and all. Wide spread of dessert.
5
seafood on a breakfast is good what more for a buffet type? thats absolutely awesome my kids love the sweets as well
4
We celebrated our company anniversary at the private room ( 25-30pax) . Food was excellent in quality quantity and variety. I don't think I finished trying all dishes! From snow crab legs, baby lobster, oysters, prawns, sashimi, sushi in the cold section to western and local favorites in the hot section. Decadent desserts fromIce sorbet to self serve yoghurt ice cream , macaroons and gorgeous cakes. Definitely value for the price for dinner but one can really eat that much food. Staff were very friendly and efficient.
5
This got to be the best buffet in town ! Lots of variety from sashimi, lobster, seafood and cook food etc and etc !The list go on and on ! Most importantly the food is fresh. There is no way you have the stomach to try all the food because the selection is so huge. Make sure you keep some space for the desserts as you will not be disappointed. The service here is excellent and the staff shows enthusiasm towards their job. But be prepared to pay as this buffet is also one of the most expensive buffet in Singapore but I find it worth the price
5
Had multiple dinners and breakfasts here on a business trip.Pros:- Great range of food (Asian, Salad, Seafood, Sushi, Indian, Carvery, Pasta- Multiple dessert stations - ice-cream stand with loads of toppings and additions (kids will love this place), also chocolate fountain and cakes stand- Loads of seafood (crab, Prawn, Fish etc..)- Good serviceCons- Price is high - mostly I think due to abundance of cold seafood- I ate there whilst on business. If I had my family in town would not go as $45 for dinner for my kids that barely eat a plate is poor value. They should make prices more family friendly.- Caters to a local population, so not so many western options - you can see this even in deserts with flavors I've never heard of- Some of the hot seafood dishes , prawns are not de-shelled. Maybe an Asian thing, though from a western point of view I want clean prawns in a stir fry- No basic drinks (like Soft-drinks) included. Should have drinks machine like many other places in SingaporeIf you love buffets come at least try it once
4
An ideal location good for gatherings. Seafood selection was fresh. Special item in store for those celebrating birthday.
2
There is a lot of hype about this buffet but I don't know why. The selection of food is nothing special. How can you have an international buffet without any pork ? No bacon!!! The only high light are the freshly made omelets.
5
After travelled to so many countries , having so many buffet around the world, this is the best buffet I ever have! You need to pre-book for dinner buffet and always crowded.
4
Celebrating friends birthday. Lots of variety, nice food and excellent service. Like the sashimi , Dessert , cooked food, cold dish, etc. Will come again.
4
I made a lunch reservation here for a birthday boy. Great selection of halal food, ranging from fresh sushi to a well stocked fresh salad bar and a good variety of international and local cooked food section. The dessert spread was awesome too! Birthday boy received a complimentary cake and a cute little dance with birthday song performed by the staff! A perfect place for a family friendly dining experience.
3
The staff were all very professional and polite. They were attentive to our requests and efficient in helping to clear the table. There was a wide selection of food, but the cooked food section wasn't that great. The duck was hard and dry. Seafood section was wonderful - the crab and oysters are a must-try! Waffles and bread pudding are delicious as well
5
Great ambience for gathering of family & friends.. Great spread of food from the cold dish to the main dishes both asian & international dishes. Not forgetting the to DIE for desserts spread esp the famous "bread pudding", chocolate fountain, ice cream station n etc. Great service from friendly staff makes the whole dining experience worth while. Great job carousel for always mantaining the high standards of food taste,dining & service.
5
Came here after reading all the positive reviews on Tripadvisor and couldn't agree more.It's got a wide selection of food, especially seafood. Freshly shucked French oysters and many types of prawns and bugs. All very high quality. Sashimi was generously sliced.There are so many types of hot food, both Asian and Western. The roast beef was excellent.There are also many types of dessert. Freshly made waffles and crepes with ice-cream with different flavors. All the food I tried were tasty and I don't think I've even tried a quarter of the food selection.Will definitely go back if I go to Singapore again
3
its the best halal resto in Singapore... They have a big range of seafood options.... they have veggitarian, carving station & other indian food as well... The winner was the ice cream bar... they have different & unique ice cream... salted egg yolk ice cream, Chendol , and other flavors are all nice... very seldom i pick a dessert in a buffet but i cant help not to try their super nice ice cream...
5
It was good to return to Straits Kitchen for their dinner buffet. The restaurant was packed for a Tuesday night and it was good we made reservations in advance. Straits Kitchen still serve the best Asian buffet in Singapore. They have the Malay section, Chinese section, Indian section, Rojak & Popiah section, Dessert section and Juice section. All the food are cooked freshly for you with dedicated chefs stationed at each section. The popiah served there is a must try and very yummy. The Indian butter chicken, Chinese prawn noodles and satay were all delicious!Make sure you come with a big appetite when you visit Straits Kitchen as they have a very good buffet spread. Service was top notch as usual. The Straits Kitchen buffet is still highly recommended but make sure you make reservations in advance as itâ€™s always full.
5
Good service from the team! There are alot of service staff who is attentive & prompt. They are always wearing a smile and eager to help.
5
Great variety of fresh and good food
Love everything , the meat, seafood, sushi, Indian food, Chinese cuisine, deserts, chocolate fondue
Go with an empty stomach and feast on everything
Rated Best buffet by many food critics , I can't agree more
2
I have come this place 3 times with my company and it was worse everytime. The seafood didn't feel that fresh. I like oysters but when I tried
4
Selection not as wide as other buffet, but we chose this restaurant because it was Halal. The quality and quantity of the food is top notch.
5
one of the best buffet places - a little pricey but real value for money - excellent food & excellent service.
buffet dinner has a wonderful
wonderful spread esp the seafood.
a place for a treat - a wonderful dining experience !
5
Excellent food
Variety of tastes
Bread pudding ultimate joy to eat
Wide range of deserts yummy yummy
Super food ....
4
Lots of selection of international cuisines. Am glad that they had macarons as it's my favourite!! Love the selections of desserts too.Price is on the pricey side but it's alright to go once in awhile to get spoilt.
4
Went for Carousel Buffet dinner over the weekends. The buffet spread was great and the food, most of them were delicious! The ice cream counter for example, has many different interesting flavours such as Milk Tea, Gula Melaka and they do taste nice (just a little sweet for one of them).The only down side was their seafood. Felt that it wasn't fresh for Oysters. The seafood quality wasn't as good. There are other Hotel's whose seafood quality is much better (comparing hotel buffet).Ohh, the way the restaurant celebrates their guest's birthday was great! Good place for birthday treat
3
They had a ton of food. It was a great variety.But the quality was so-so. For example, the seafood was cooked without seasoning.Some of the dishes were dirty.You pay a lot of money to get in, but drinks -- even sodas -- cost extra.
3
this buffet is ranked highly no doubt but quality will tend to suffer when we cook in bulk and we tend to overload so that's terrible for the wasteline. Not just this buffet but any buffet we should avoid else be prepared to run 10 miles to compensate. Can't remember my last visit though..
4
The food standard is good. It's Halal and the staff were attentive even when the restaurant was packed to capacity. Many variety from international, to local, to japanese. Try the desserts for some fusion ice cream ! The Chendol ice cream is good.
3
A great selection of food but let down by unattentive staff and a price just too high to be worth it
5
It's the best hi-tea buffet I have gone to before! Amazing variety and a good spread of different cuisines. The food taste yummy too! It's really worth every penny! Eat everything!!!
5
Had a good night with a great service from ERNEST
Highly recommended. Never a doubt a great place for hungry humans.. 😊😍😍
4
I like the speed the food is topped up. It’s fast. There are a lot varieties in food. They provided us a long rect table as for our big group of 10 pax. It’s a ideal place for gathering, long chit chat, food & drink as there is no limitation on the the dining duration. I like the grill fish & paella seafood counters. I don’t take cold drink, they do provide different types of tea bags with refillable hot water.
4
We enjoy the fresh seafood such as sashimi, crayfish, oyster, prawns, scallops and snow-crabs. The dessert was great too not forgetting their ice-cream and waffle station is definitely a plus point. The whole range of cooked food are fantastic too. The staff are constantly look out for your needs. The point of improvement is that I went there with my wife and toddler, actually they were preparing to seat three adults which I feel is a bit cramp. Even with my toddler, is not ideal as we will be putting several plates of food on our table. We definitely need an extra table and seat for our 2+1 or even 3 persons
5
As a buffet lovers, carousel definitely worth a visit and value for money. Better make a reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. The spread of buffet is amazing and we all love it. Staffs were so helpful as well. A must try buffet restaurant in Singapore and you won't regret!
4
Due to our tight schedule it suddenly came to my mind in the morning to hold a 3 in 1 advance birthday celebration at one go. Even though it was a very last minute plan, I really appreciate to receive a call from one of the staff to confirm my online High Tea reservation asap on the 24th of September.Adding on, I was super duper feeling very happy when my last minute special request to surprise my only princess and BFF were fulfilled. All the staff got together and sang a birthday song to us including those who were celebrating their birthday on that day. Since it was so called the 3 in 1 birthday celebration for my princess, BFF and myself, we were given a nice decorated slice of rainbow birthday cake each. Thumbs up to carousel for the tasty food, plus the friendly environment and staff.
5
We went for a dinner 19th September to celebrate my birthday with my husband and Friends and as usual had a fantastic meal. Extremely high standard of cuisine, coupled with great restaurant atmosphere. Very courteous/happy staff. A real pleasure. All friends very impressed. I will return!!!“We recommend CAROUSEL to people
4
The food is fresh and extensive ranging from Japanese, Mediterranean to local dishes. The ambience can be quite noisy due to the rather packed restaurant. Staff are welcoming and are always around to help with clearing with plates. Great ambience and variety in food that are fresh and extensive. Staffs are on the go and very welcoming. Really enjoyed my time at Carousel. Thank you so much for the pleasant dinner experience :-
5
Great ambience Friday night with birthday surprise.Good food and top quality like those ice-creams corners & desserts.Staffs will sing & dance birthday songs for you.Really enjoy hopefully Carousel will be remain top buffet in Singapore near future.
5
Great ambience and variety in food that are fresh and extensive. Staffs are on the go and very welcoming. Really enjoyed my time at Carousel. Thank you so much for the pleasant dinner experience :-)
5
We were warmly greeted by the front desk officers. The restaurant serves a wide spread of food from local to International. Quantity is there but yet quality is not compromised. I have already enjoyed my dining at the Carousel buffet.
4
The food variety is quite extensive, the restaurant is crowded most of the time. The restaurant does not serve pork dishes.
5
Yummilicious spread of fresh seafood is always inviting. There is always something for all taste buds.
The menu is predictable, variety is vast and service is excellent.
I will definitely return again... and again...
5
Seafood very fresh, very good spread of food. A excellent place for gathering with Friend. Just a little pricy !
5
It was a fabulous experience to dine in Carousel...wide variety of food to choose from and the excellent service we received...Staffs are attentive and friendly. Thumbs up.
4
I stopped here for lunch and wanted to try a bunch of different types of foods while in Singapore. It was pretty expensive but I think buffets in Singapore are that way. Great selection of chilled seafood, Chinese, Indian, and other foods. The Indian food was pretty good but had long lines. The gelato bar was nice to try many different flavors. Left this place very full and satisfied
4
Variety choice of food from Chinese to Western, Italian, Japanese, Indian and etc. Fresh seafood was the most popular section ever! Reserved for birthday celebration for 3 pax and they gave a slide of cake each and a short peformance by restaurant staff to surprise us! Reasonable price for weekend buffet dinner. Waiter and waiters are friendly, one of the waiters help us to take family photo and email immediately to me.
5
Awesome place and very convenient located opposite orchard mrt. Had the high tea buffet which serves lots of food from Indian, Chinese, nonya, Japanese cuisine. Cosy place for family and friends. Did told reception about my sister birthday and they sang birthday song for her and a slice of cake. I'm impressed Quality and variety of food is awesome Will be back again
5
One of the best seafood buffet in Singapore. Food selection was very wide and great. Services were fast. Will return again
5
Went there for high tea and the variety and standard of the food was great! Will definitely revisit.
2
Had the buffet at lunch. Mediocre food not very appetizing. Limited choice e.g. 4 salads. Poor value for money. Go if halal food is a compulsion.
3
This buffet is value for money but the food here is average at best. I enjoyed the shawarma though, as it was the most unique item.
Other than that, the staff are polite and the atmosphere is okay.
5
We went there for a birthday celebration and the made effort to give a cake, song and photo. The food was excellent, oysters very fresh and choice was great. Worth a visit.
5
We love the buffet spread especially desserts. There's variety of food available. Spoilt for choice.
5
"Dine in with friends to celebrate my husband's birthday. Buffet spread was good and delicious. So many choices to choose from the buffet spread though portions are quite minimal. Personal favourite of mine would be desserts section. Since its my husband birthday, complimentary photo and cake were given out to guests. Successful surprise for him. Thank you to the team of front host/hostess and reservations. Ill definitely make a come back but for dinner and lunch. As of now they are having some debit/credit promotions with certain banks (20% discount off your bill) for lunch,dinner and high tea. Once again Carousel,my personal best buffet hotel,team are friendly and fantastic service as always."
4
Very fresh and tasty seafood, wide spread. Nice and sweet cakes for dessert and a plus point is there is no lard as it is a Halal restaurant, however need to book at least a week ahead. High Tea for Sat and Sun are long queue so to avoid any disappointment, book early
5
My partner and i had occasionally dine at carousel. Best time to come would be dinner to taste their full spread dishes and fresh oyster from France would be my favourite. Service is outstanding and great place to celebrate birthdays. A surprise from carousel team - Birthday slice cake and a team to sing a bday song. And a picture memory sent via email. The variety of food spread is great and those who have muslim friend need not worry as food are halal certified. And those that need alcohol, you can bring your own champagne and wine but must advise them in advance and a corkage charge may apply depending on the number of bottles u intend to bring.Totally recommend anyone who wants to dine and have a great dining experience.Spread for high tea and lunch is pretty gd as well and normally less crowded at high tea.Recommended cold seafood platte
4
Have a nice dinner with Carousel ! Good service as they always clear your plate after you finish your food. nice buffet spread and excellent dessert choice. But the con is that if you book more than 8 person you have to leave your credit card detail that i don't feel so safe about it
5
We really enjoy this buffet ! Plenty of choices and plenty of quality food. The service is prompt and the atmosphere is great.
5
The food was really good and you had a great choice. The seafood (sushis, lobster, shrimps) and the meat (beef and chicken) was particularly great. Service is good as well and the prices are moderate.
5
An ideal place to have quality food & its halal too. Good service, relaxing ambience, ample verity. Be it breakfast , lunch or dinner, you will be more than satisfied
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday with a well-known sumptuous buffet spread last night at Carousel. Once seated, the catering attendant John approached me politely who was the Birthday lady and explained the flow of celebration. My friend was very happy and excited with the music and short dance performed by the catering team. John painstakingly took photo for birthday group table by table and sent us the photo right away via email. It was really a special service that the hotel has in plan without asking! You jus need to inform you have birthday celebration and Carousel will do the rest for you with a memorable moment! Keep up the good work! Thank you!
5
Consistently the best hotel buffet in Singapore! We have recently dined at 3 other hotel buffets and this one still comes up tops! Reasons: Fresh and succulent seafood - Hokkaido crab legs, giant jumbo prawns, sweet crayfish, oysters etc. Yummy Japanese sushi, sashimi. Salads, Carvery with roast beef, chicken, Yorkshire pudding, baked salmon. Hot food - curries, cereal prawns, honey grilled veal ribs & too many to name, noodles to order, chicken rice, vegetarian options. Desserts! Variety of gelato on freshly baked waffles, waffle cones with toppings galore -smarties, gummy bears, marshmellow, choc rice, meringues, nuts, strawberry/choc sause, fresh cream. Many mouthwatreing cakes, pastries, macaroons, puddings, chocolate & white choc fondue, fruits cut & whole.....Everything fresh and regularly replenished. Gourmet coffee & tea to round it off. Plus if you are celebrating a birthday - a nice surprise awaits
4
A good spread and worth the money spent as the food quality and quantity is more than you can eat. Good place to celebrate special events. Ambiences of the restaurant is good and enjoy our lunch there. Will be there again. Prices is on higher end. As it is rather popular, a booking in advance will be good to prevent disappointment
5
I had dinner with my daughter at this renowned Halal Buffet Restaurant in the heart of Singapore, who have voted for seven year running as the best buffet restaurant and I do celebrate with them. on each of my visit to Carousel I would without hesitation go for their Japanese Fried Food & Sushi counter. Their soup is always very tasty with al the seafood & seasonal vegetables thrown in and the Restaurant have very unusual sushi items and salmon is always very fresh.I also love their Laksa, pasta and last but not least the desserts.Service is great - the moment I arrive all the hostesses would be greeting me with their wholesome radiant smile and what amazes me is that they could even identify me the moment they hear my voice on the phone. The staff form a good orchestra daily wishing the guests ":Happy Birthday". i can identify with Sherilyn who has been promoted as Manager and Sarah who never fail to brew me that aromatic coffee.
5
Recommended halal buffet high tea. Pricing for lunch, high tea and dinner were displayed appropriately. Food items are generally satisfactory. Loved the Ice Kacang Corner., Japanese Cold items and Sushi plus the Dessert. Nasi lemak and chicken rice were also available. A small Kueh pie tee station and waffle station must not be missed.
5
We arrived at the hotel lobby and ask for our reservation, the staffs are friendly and will greet you with a smile, we seated not that far from the buffet area, lots of seafood selection, food was great, we enjoyed all of it and we had a great time. Overall Experienced was Great. A bit pricey but worth it. We Will definitely go back if they still have the dbs posb credit card promotion.
4
Came here for dinner and was presented with an amazing spread of food ranging from a wide variety of fresh sashimi, to even Indian, Chinese and western cuisines. Of which, a friendly and polite chef, Robert Mak, served me a delicious pesto pasta dish from the pasta section of the buffet. The pasta was first boiled and your choice of toppings and sauce would then be added into the dish, serving up a portion of hot, fresh food.
5
Nice place, located in Orchard road next to Shown house.
Very fresh sea food and excellent service!
UOB card has 20% off
5
Impeccable service and lovely spread of food. Great variety n taste! Our choice buffet place especially for celebrations. The servers and chefs were attentive to the needs of our little one. Would highly recommend families to dine there.
5
Carousel is well know for its spread of seafood and sashimi. Pleasantly when I was there in July, they added an ice cream counter + waffle! Shiok!
4
Food variety was very decent and the seafood selections were the most popular. Dessert was not too bad as well. The only downside is due to its popularity, the tables are quite close to one another.
4
This a upscale buffe setup with everything you can eat plus a bit more!Extensive sea food section that stands out in both size and quality from similar buffe setup´s. Naturally plus all other types of food from local to Indian and Italian.The desert buffe´leaves very little to wish for, save some room for that.Prices changes based on day and time of the day, evening mid week the price was 76 SGD
5
This place is of course very well known and I decided to celebrate my baby full month with my family and colleague. There is a lot of seafood to choose from, which I think is the major attraction And i was so impressed with the quality. Also, some items were quickly consumed and no replacement items were offered (i.e., prawn nigiri sushi). I was also surprised there was no drink selection offered, basically you get water and help yourself to automatic coffee/espresso machines. In general, I have to give this place an average mark considering the price, quality, and selection. I might eat here again with guests in town, but would probably try other spots first

This place is of course very well known and I decided to try with my family when they were visiting Singapore. There is a lot of seafood to choose from, which I think is the major attraction. I was not as excited by the quality as most people seem to be. We eat sushi and oysters frequently, so perhaps I am more picky than most people, but I was not that impressed with the quality. Also, some items were quickly consumed and no replacement items were offered (i.e., prawn nigiri sushi). I was also surprised there was no drink selection offered, basically you get water and help yourself to automatic coffee/espresso machines. The non-seafood selection was not that impressive, though the deserts seemed quite interesting with a large selection. In general, I have to give this place an average mark considering the price, quality, and selection. I might eat here again with guests in town, but would probably try other spots first
5
Was there with colleagues last Friday for dinner. The food spread was excellent as already described by others. I particularly liked the Japanese section with fresh sashimi and cooked food eg fried garlic rice, fried beef slices! I would like to compliment 2 staff: Mr Jasini and Mathi. I accidentally splashed chili crab onto myself while struggling to eat it. They came back a few times, to give napkins, and also persuade me to change out while they took my top to wash. In an hour time, my white top came back super clean and dry and ironed neatly!! Kudos to the service team!!

Was in Singapore on business and had a night to myself so as always I get onto TripAdvisor and look for something special, now normally I would avoid buffets at all cost when traveling on business but due to the ratings and quality of reviews I thought I would press the gamble button On arrival I was told that I only had 1 hour before they closed which was not a problem for me, on being shown to my seat I was again told that the restaurant would be closing in under an hour. I stated with some Sushi sashimi salmon & tuna and the quality was seriously poor (the salmon uneatable), next the lobster and crab not much better. After this I was reminded about the closing time and observed that no fresh food was being prepared, yes there is tremendous choice but apart from the Indian selection which was ok the rest was a total let down, the dessert section looked good and was always busy.15 minutes before closing I was again reminded that they were closing by then I was done anyway. If you look at my previous reviews I always try to be honest and positive, the reason that I'm so disappointed with Carousel Buffet is that the price was expensive and if I'd spent the same money in many of the other local restaurants I'm confident that not only would I have enjoyed a good meal but the service would have been better and not rushed.To summarise I'd say the Carousel Buffet is a tourist trap and if you want to visit it would be better to go when they open and better if your in a group where at leat the conversation would be good.

celebrating wife birthday for dinner, notice that mostly fully booked even on weekday. friendly and attentive staff, fresh seafood with lobster and variety of food is good enough. the homemade ice cream was impressive.overall daughter and wife was happy with carousel buffet, also thanks for the birthday cake
5
Excellent selection of items available. Staff are very helpful.
We only had breakfast here but I did tour the buffet selection at lunch. Again it looked amazing. All items were halal.
4
Food was overall good. Would been better if there are more variety of cooked food. Service and ambience was great!
5
Wide spread of good food and excellent service. Friendly staff and great for birthday celebration because they have a unique way of celebrating birthdays. Location is good for shoppers. Thumbs up..!!
5
I went for causal dinning with my friends. The staff was efficient and did a performance for us. Food was one of the best which i had eaten for buffet. Love the spread!!! Great recommendation for Halal buffet :)
5
Carousel has been our choice of buffet for a very Long time now. After trying out a lot of buffet places in Singapore we decided that carousel is the best. The quality of the food is great. The seafood spread is excellent ( they have lobsters). Indian, Mediterranean,Chinese and western food all taste as authentic as they should be. The staff are courteous and very professional. There are a lot of deserts too. Macaroons, cakes, pastries are done to perfection . Birthday celebrants get a free cake and the whole group of staff sing a birthday song for the celebrant. Overall as I have mentioned above carousel is the best buffet i have ever been to in Singapore
5
On the 20 Aug , we are celebrating our anniversary in Carousell! And whats surprise me is , they gave a slice of cake ! All the food is fantastic, delicious! We love the lamb, ribs all seafoods ! Its super nice ! Its only the desserts can improve on it . Everything was an excellent service ! Keep it up and we would recommend ! Thank you !
5
I would have to say I made a very last min reservation but yet they got back to me very quickly n confirmed my reservation. The service is excellent. From the staff who confirmed the reservation to the staff who attended to us, their service is polite, friendly n pleasing. They even gave a slice of cake for the farewell treat on their own ACC. A Gd place to recommend.
5
I decided to book dinner for 2 last night at this place to celebrate my partner's birthday. We were well taken care of Wan Wei, and she consistently delivered service with a smile! The food selection may not be as wide as the other buffet restaurants around the city, but the quality of food is superb and the culinary team replenishes the buffet spread frequently and on time. Last night was my fourth time to visit this place, and I have always had a good dining experience. Will definitely come back to Carousel again
2
I had a unforgettable experience with carousel. The food was a let down. I mean, if one was to pay 80 dollars per person (after discounts too!), one would expect seafood that is at least fresh. The oysters were however not fresh, the crabs were a dismal size (yes, it is a buffet but still at least get crabs of a decent size for that price tag you are asking for?). The birthday cake with the well wishes was horribly written as if it was not written by a pastry chef but an untrained staff. Sorry for all these harsh words but at this point in time, it looks like all the good reviews on the various sites has gone to your head and clearly the meal reflects the shoddy quality of food and this dining experience was not definitely not worth the 80 bucks per person
5
Celebrated our 8th anniversary at The Carousel and utterly enjoyed ourselves with the amazing food coupled with the 20% discount from most major banks. Knowing it was our anniversary, the restaurant also took the initiative to offer us a slice of cake and to take pictures for us.Would definitely visit again

Pros
1) Very wide spread international buffet spreed
2) Interesting selections of sweet treats (e.g ice cream, fondue, cakes)
3) Fine interior and very helpful staffs
Cons
1) Some items not so fresh
For brave heart patrons - try the wasabi ice cream

Smiling faces of service staff make this place a must-return, spread is wide, quality can be better for some sections, but we are not complaining !
5
the food was amazing . carousel is always the number 1 halal buffet high tea in Singapore would definitely come back again! thank you for the amazing food and great service . i really enjoyed my high tea
4
The spread was good. Top up frequently and wide choices of selection. Visited more than 3 times. Friendly staff too
5
To the best Halal Buffet Restaurant. Although almost cost $100 per pax, worth every cents. Huge spread of food, drinks and desserts. You will get LOS here ; Lobster.Oyster.Salmon. That's a must for sure. Not forgetting Japanese food like Sushis. Live station of pasta, lamb and beef. Indian and Chinese cuisine. Would always recommend everyone to eat here till you drop.

This Carousel Buffet in Royal Plaza on Scotts is a very popular with both the locals as well as overseas visitors. The hotel is located at a strategic part of Orchard Road and is always crowded with a lot of people who either come in the hotel for a visit or wine and dine or even visit the toilet. Food in the Carousel Buffet has a wide range of selection which caters to people of all ages as well as all nationalities. Price of the buffet is also not very expensive with this wide range of food and fruits as well as dessert. Furthermore the chefs take great care to always came out of their cooking place and refill the food periodically as well as interacting with the customers. I would definitely recommend this place for either a family affair or even a dating night

We went there to celebrate a very belated Mother's Day and we were a table of 5. The original seat they sat us at was right next to the grill. Right when they lit the grill, we decided that it wasn't a good seat and requested to switch. We were seated in an enclave area which made chatting a lot more conducive, except that it's a bit of a round to the main buffet lines. Staff were pleasant to assist even though 3 out of the 5 members were all trying to choose seats.Food, the selection is wide - seafood, Japanese, local Asian and also some western options. All relatively tasty except the Indian food which was a bit bland and tough. The desserts were nice too, with a good selection of western and local options. Of the desserts, the ice cream is the best as we got to try every single flavour in little scoops. For tables celebrating birthdays, they put on a little dance and sang happy birthday, giving out slices of cakes to the celebrants. On this note, where we were seated, they'd needed to mind the audio volume as the music came on really loud suddenly, giving our poor aunt and mother a rude shock - not great for a people over 70. Otherwise, service was prompt and polite, the place is lovely to dine in and certainly a place to recommend.

You need to come here with an empty stomach, and I mean no breakfast, and lunch. They have a huge food options and cuisines. Highlight is the cold seafood, think lobsters and oysters and king crabs! Honestly i was here for the seafood. But they have Japanese offerings, like sushi, and teppanyaki. A salad bar, roasted meats, and other Mediterranean cuisine, Indian and local fares. Not to mention a plethora of dessert options. I mean it's a long list and you can easily spend more than an hour here to try all the stuff, given that you are not yet full. It's a bit pricey though and gets noisy and crowded. For me price is alright, as you get all these food options, the noise can sometimes get you. If you want to have a peaceful dinner, you won't get it here. The seats are very close together to accommodate a lot of people.
5
Amazing food, you wouldn't think its buffet because the food are tasty and delicious. My son loved the white chocolate fountain and the dessert station so much. If you love local food, this restaurant is highly recommended. Everything exceeds my expectation even the staffs are attentive and helpful.
3
We had the breakfast buffet and i must say the food selection is just the usual and taste was is average. Nothing really fancy about it. I am curious with the lunch and dinner buffet though. But we weren't able to try because we have made other reservations. Overall average rating for me
4
Excellent buffet spread. No need for lunch or dinner if you attend this high-tea!
Food was generally good but the ambience seems to have lost its lustre since my last visit 8 years ago.
5
Really great quality buffet with a heaps of different seafood options. So much food I didn't know what to eat.
5
We had a family gathering and decided to do a buffet. This is one of the best buffets we had. Good buffets are not cheap in Singapore but this is worth it. It has an amazing spread and the food is very good.
5
Best breakfast buffet in Singapore. On this trip I did not do lunch or dinner. Is popular. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The selection is great. So great that after breakfast you don't need to eat until dinner!!
3
A famous cafe serving halal food.
Choices are abundant for their buffet spread.
Prices and quality goes hand in hand.
Will not burn a hole in your pocket.
5
The food was amazing and there were many different cuisines on display. There were also a few people celebrating their birthday and the staff all joined in for the celebrations. Highly recommended!
5
Carousel is truly a top choice for buffets (if only it was cheaper, but i guess you get what you pay for)There's currently a 20% discount for major bank cards.Carousel is a class of its own, the varieties are aplenty and you can easily overeat even though you might be just trying abit of everything. It's muslim friendly, but you definitely wont miss the pork with the variety they offer. Desserts which are usually a so-so for most buffets are of excellent quality here. Would visit over and over again
5
An amazing array of seafood awaits you at the Carousel restaurant,as much Lobster and prawns that you can eat in one sitting , also sushi being made in front of you is as fresh as it could possibly be.If you are a meat eater the rib eye of beef is rare but if you prefer it medium they will put it on the grill for you. The Indian food here is also brilliant and beautifully cooked.The desserts look and taste amazing and they also have home made ice cream to indulge on.$89 buys you a fantastic experience , with a discount if you are a hotel guest
4
We had the breakfast at the carousel multiple times as hotel guests and it was extensive with a lot of western and asian options, most of it delicious. Good coffee too. Service was a little variable though, sometimes plates were not cleared in time. Certainly worth a try if you are staying here, but even otherwise if you are looking for a big start to the day. Highly Recommended
5
The atmosphere was like an ordinary buffet, crowded in front of seafood and others. But, when we tried the first plate, we were hooked in no time. The second plate, the third and so on never dropped in the taste. We wonder if the Carousel collects all top chefs in one place. Every kind of food can be a famous stand-alone on its own. We had not mentioned about the efficient service. Thank all staffs. They work hard to please us.The small disadvantages are the lack of pork dish. We understand the islamic culture but the tourists come from every corner of the world, don't they
5
It would have been better if the high tea is from
2:30pm to 5:30pm instead of 3:30pm to 5:30pm.
Overall, service and food were fantastic!
Definetely will be back
5
Excellent and attentive staff and the delicious high tea spread.
I always host all my special events/ occasions at Carousel.
My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this high tea session.
Will keep returning to Carousel!
5
Had a wonderful time celebrating my bestfriend's birthday with wonderful spread of buffet and top notch service provided. Definitely returning for another celebration with the family soon.
4
Good food . Good spread of foods. Friendly staff and the way the staff hold the bday party was awesome
5
Great varieties..however it's pretty costly for dinner buffet. If only it's price is lowered. Then perhaps I would make it a monthly affair. Cheers!!
5
Birthday treat for my boy.. Wide selection of good food, Excellent services rendered by the staffs.. they gathered for a dance and singing session for all who were celebrating their birthday by presenting a birthday cake to them. Thank U! We had a great time!
4
The pricing is steep but the selection of the buffet during dinner was commendable. A good combination of both local and international dishes. The choice of freshly backed breads were excellent. Service staff were friendly and attentive to our need.
5
One of our colleagues was celebrating her birthday. She, together with our diners who were also celebrating their birthday, were presented with a birthday cake and a song/ dance number by the staff. Heartwarming gesture.For someone who loves seafood, this is definitely the restaurant for you
5
I always enjoy the Hi-Tea buffet as it includes a wide selection of food choices and is one of the best Halal buffet which our Muslim friends can enjoy too. The time is just right for us. There are cold seafood like prawns, crabs, oysters, sashimi. Hot food like chicken rice, laksa, meats, veg. Wide selection of dessert like Bo Bo Cha Cha, Ice Kacang, ice cream, cakes, waffle and many more...Will come again.
5
A good and reasonable place for lunch especially some cohesion event for my work team. It was always need some effort to find restaurant which can accommodate large group and halal food, so this is the best place! Food is nice and price is reasonable too. Must try
5
Celebrated my daughter 21st birthday dinner. Great spread of sumptuous food coupled with excellent and friendly services from the staffs there, presenting a birthday cake to my daughter. My family fully enjoyed the evening at Carousel. A big thank you to all the staff !
5
Great service....Staff were very nice and helpful. The variety of food could be more but the cold seafood variety was great
5
Great food... wide spread of cuisine... foods taste great... great staff...thank you for our last minute request... fully recommended..
5
A great spread of dishes. Excellent for entertaining a group of friends. Good location and parking. Easy access from Orchard MRT
4
Great place to eat with family. However during peak periods, the staff sometimes take a while to clear the plates
2
Very poor selection or varieties
Too pricey
Can get better food in other hotel despite the 20% discount
5
We went for a high tea buffet on a Sunday for a birthday celebration. I left a message in my booking to mention that we are there to celebrate birthday. The staff was careful to approach only me to check if the birthday girl is present (for the surprise element), and inform me that there will be a complimentary cake. Later on, the staff gathered but and started to sing and dance for all who were celebrating their birthday in the restaurant before presenting their birthday cake to them. They even approach us to take photos for us. We were very impressed by the wonderful service. There is a wide range of food the choose from. The seafood are fresh and the cooked food are well executed. The chocolate molten lava pudding is irresistible and totally worth every calorie. Will definitely go back there for a second visit
5
Went for their special Taiwan High Tea. The spread for a Hi-tea is big. Food is pretty yummy too. Wish have been better if they served rice porridge together with their braised items.. seems abit strange to just eat them on its own.Make a beeline for the rojak first, I waited til near the end to get it and was disappointed that the bowls were empty.It was an enjoyable Hi tea. Would probably go again in due time
5
Widespread of seafood plus other delicacies.Excellent services rendered by the staff - very attentiveness and see to your needs.Good experience and surprise for all who have had their birthday celebration.Carousel team also sends the photo to us and this is definitely memorable.Well done guys and keep up the good work
4
When you have a buffet breakfast in a hotel it is so easy to overeat...and this is no exception. The range of foods available is good and the supply is continually topped up. The wait staff are efficient and the food servers are friendly.The made to order items are nice and hot whilst ready made items are just warm. There should be enough selection to suit most people.Th fresh pineapple is divine
5
The spread was impressive and food quality good. Despite it being very full, we did not need to queue much for anything we wanted. Service staff were excellent. Attentive, friendly and quick.
3
very limited vegetarian options
we went as its halal but its not cheap
good service and large salad bar not too bad
5
Very very very good food! Fresh fish and a very wide set of dishes: from dish to vegetables to meat! And The price is more than reasonnable.
5
Service is great,especially with the fun birthday sing and dance by the service crew and the chefs!!
5
Superb service and the food is fresh and delicious. My kid who is quite difficult to please loves the food there! We had a very satisfying high tea.
4
emailed them to enquire about birthday celebration. they responded fast and promptly, also attached the promotion as well.went for the Taiwanese high tea, food wise is so so. still prefer the normal lunch & dinner buffet.some prawns are not so fresh. salmon sashimi is nice. nasi lemak rice has to go with their sambal, it is delicious. the popiah, although its taste is not bad but it is pretty big for a mouthful. red bean pancakes are delicious as well. the skin for the pan fried crystal bun is pretty hard, i guess they are left outside for too long. the mango mousse don't taste nice & it is not pleasant looking after slicing. i love the chocolate lava pudding.i want to thank your staff for the effort to celebrate my hubby's birthday. the complimentary birthday cake is savory, the sweetness is just nice for his tastebuds. also thank you for helping us to take photos.on top of everything, thank you for the 20% credit cards promotion!will be back there for lunch / dinner next time

I rarely write bad reviews, as I would have done enough research to avoid eateries that deserved bad reviews. But, this is an exception. I reckon, I was too intrigued by their "Tantalising Taiwanese Hi Tea" buffet to make a reservations before even checking the reviews.A rookie mistake i will not allow myself to commit again. First off, there was absolutely nothing Taiwanese about it. Okay, maybe I was too harsh. There was a Taiwanese oyster omelette that looked nothing like the ones I had in Taiwan, and a salt and pepper fried chicken which was just tasteless. In the pan that says "scallion pancake" were these red bean pancakes, which are totally different things! The only passable item was the pan fried crystal bun, which, honestly, I wasn't sure is Taiwanese.Fine, so it wasn't Taiwanese, but at least it's Asian, right? Well, it does have a decent selection of Asian food, but I wasn't impressed by anything I've tried. The chicken satay was, again, tasteless. The soy-braised beef (it should normally be pork, but since this is a halal buffet, they used beef instead) was not memorable. There was a sushi counter - at least the salmon sashimi was decent. And the only thing I liked was the nasi lemak, which was accompanied by a nice "sambal".The dessert again was a total let-down, which is the ultimate sin, considering this is supposed to be a hi-tea. The ice cream was way too soft, and the "nonya kueh" was, again, tasteless!The only saving grace, and the reason this gets 2* instead of 1* is the service. Plates were cleared quickly and the buffet dishes were always replenished.What bothered me the most was the throng of tourists frequenting the restaurant! This is such a bad representation of Singapore food! If you are willing to splurge for a hotel buffet, go across the road to the Straits Kitchen at Grand Hyatt, or check out the beautiful Colony at the Ritz Carlton. And if you don't want to splurge, just frequent the hawkers at Esplanade or even the food courts at Ion Orchard. Trust me, your stomach will thank you
4
Wide spread for halal buffet but 1 of the most expensive in town if not for credit card discount.Laksa is good but disappointing desert range.Except for the chocolate fountain, there is really a poor array of cakes, fruits, and kueh.Even the fruits are poor cheap and poor variety. Had seen better range at cheaper buffets.Service from the staff is good, they put up a vibrant birthday celebration performance for some guests having birthdays. Good job crew, helps Carousel to score some points.Hope Carousel can improve on its quality of food.My party was happy with the outing.Cheers
1
Disappointing overall . Staff food prep was haphazard & food was not not fully ready at the start of the tea session . Food quality was below par & top up was slow . Party of four celebrating a friend's visit from Christchurch was marred by this experience 
5
Make a reservation online and receive a very fast reply from them. Spoilt for choice on the varieties of food. Oysters were fresh. Cold dishes were promtly topup when they running low. Local food, Japanese food western etc can really suits all n everyone tastebud. I came to treat my sister lunch on her birthday...the best part the staff have managed to make my sister cry of joy when they have a 'mini concert' for the birthday guest n a slice of cake personnally delivered to the birthday girl/boy.Thank you to all staff. We enjoyed it very muc
5
nice service and fresh oyster, enjoyed and recommend! many stlye delicious intetnational food with coffee and tea.
4
Selection were awesome and fresh.
Ambient was great and wonderful place to catch up.
Food were freshly made and delicious. Authentic cuisine also available in this outlet, such as Laksa.
3
The spread was special and not something which can be found at other buffer restaurants. However, it is definitely a little overpriced at $80++. Fresh seafood spread was decent.
5
Wonderful service, nice ambience! Seafood is really fresh.
Enjoyed the song and dance by the team for those celebrating their birthday, it was a pleasant surprise!
I will definitely be back with my family!
Keep up the great work!
5
We went there with empty stomach and came out fully loaded. Thanks to Carousel..I gain 1kg. Overall..satisfying experience
4
It was a great experience, with good food, nice ambience and good service too. I will be back and will recommend others too.
5
Was there for a birthday celebration. Well design place and the staff us super friend and helpful. I will visit them again
4
We celebrated my Girlfriend's birthday in carousel to have a little bit of everything.Food is cooked and tasted to the expectation and seafood were fresh.The amazing part is the service by Mr. Deepak! Job well done. I hope Carousel will let him know.Thank yo
3
The food tends to run out quite quickly and the chefs took a long time to replenish them. There was barely enough seafood or dishes to feed the entire restaurant. Loved the bread butter pudding with vanilla sauce. Other than that, the rest of the food was just average
3
Lots of food selections, although cheese platter was quite disappointing. Seafood ran out quickly so make sure you get your hands on the crayfish as soon as they come out. Lots of ice cream flavours to choose from which you can have with freshly made waffles.
4
The seafood was quite a wide spread and yes it is damn fresh!! The waiter and waitress are also helpful and courtesy. Very pleasant dining in at carousel. Definitely will petronise again!!
4
The seafood and dessert galore is well worth coming. The mains are somewhat limited but the Indian curries is also a good spread.
Price is reasonable and would be a 3.5 stars for food and 4 stars for service.
5
My 1st time there with my husband to celebrate his birthday, was very satisfied with carousel's excellent staff service and their great spread of food choices!
3
The food selection was ample for the price, the quality of the food was actually pretty good. With so few Halal Certified buffets in this country, Carousel is one of the places I enjoy going to with my Muslim friends who enjoy a fancy lunch/dinner spread. The shawarma is surely one of my favourites! The staff were attentive, constantly clearing our plates and never leaving our glasses empty.
4
The night we visited, Carousel was on Thai night. Basically, it was buffet with a Thai corner. The buffet spread was very wide, it would take an effort to list them all down. Our group enjoyed the ff: appetizers of fresh crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans, salmon, tuna, maki with black roe. Most visited booth included the steak station - the Sirloin Steak with mustard was so good, it merited 2-3 visits. Next popular areas were roasted lamb, tom yan gung and pad thai. The dessert station offered different fruits, pastries like macaroons and sweets (creme brûlée)Good job, Carousel
4
Really wide spread and the quality is generally pretty good. Can't complain for the price of the buffet. Their cold seafood and sashimi section itself will probably make it worth it for majority of people. Their home-made ice-cream is also something that you should try.If you're lucky enough to be there when its someone's birthday (or even your own), I believe you'll get to see all the staff perform a number. :
5
My repeat visit at Carousel cos they don't disappoint!Carousel has always been my preferred choice for dinner buffet. A good spread of fresh seafood, Asian delights and some other international food choices. While staffs are attentive and friendly, we were all smiles to witness all the staff and even chefs performing a little song for the diners on 3rd June. A moment later we were served two slices of cake since my family were there to celebrate our birthday. Always so pleased with the service and food at Carousel. My advice is to book in advanced as it's often fully reserved and do expect a crowd when you're there. Dessert line - not to be missed! Do save some room for their amazing desserts
5
The service was exceptional and i was surprised by the interior. It was really posh and big with different varieties of food and deserts. During my online reservation, i mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and if they could provide the complimentary bday cake. Halfway through dining, around 10-15 staff surrounded us to sing and perform the birthday song for all those whom were celebrating their birthdays. It was really wonderful as they put in alot of effort and my friend was very happy!! They even took a picture of those celebrating their birthdays and emailed it to us!Other than that, certain food items such as the omelette was slightly dry and cold. I wish i had the space in my tummy to sit and eat more for the money! Overall experience was great
4
Amazing choice of food everyday that will delight an assorted range of palettes. Royal Plaza on Scotts has always been top notch when it comes to service and this gem of a restaurant is definitely up there with the rest of the gourmet establishments that is a must visit whenever in Singapore
4
We stayed at the Royal Plaza on Scotts for 7 days, however we only dined at the Carousel Buffet twice (once for breakfast and again for dinner). Enormous range of dishes on offer and well cooked/presented. The staff are very courteous and efficient. We're not big buffet buffs, hence eating there only twice, however if buffets are your thing this will not disappoint. The buffet cost us just under $200 for 2 which is extremely pricey if you don't eat a lot, however for those that like to refill their plates with high end seafood etc numerous times it is a bargain
5
We've been to many hotel buffets, my dad says that this is the best buffet he has tried!
I always come back here for the desserts and the quality and taste of food!
4
Brought a colleague here for the buffet to celebrate his birthday. Food selection was good and it's definitely a good deal if you're buying someone a meal. Love the seafood!
5
The serving Staff is excellent and cheerful too....The food is good & fresh.The desserts is marvellous.
5
Excellent spread of food from fresh lobster claws to mouth watering chocolate fondue. Great ambience and service. Got a photo taken too. Awesome!
5
My family has been to numerous hotel buffets in Singapore and this is our favorite. While at this level the buffet restaurants all offer unlimited lobster tails, oysters, etc., We found that carousel has the best international selection, and if all around the best. Cannot go wrong here and the 10% discount for using a Citi card does not hurt either
5
I love the atmosphere and the range of food at Carousel. I need not worry that my Guest will not enjoy their MEAL & Not only are their staff Friendly; they are very attentive to your needs. The BEST part is- their food are HALAL and they have very Nice n Clean Prayer rooms for the MUSLIM. So I could enjoy my FOOD and at the same time not missed my Prayers. TQ Carousel for Caring & Loving your GUES
5
It was an awesome and nice experience. My wife and son had a great time. Thanks to the birthday surprise celebration for them. The food was really excellent. The staff were friendly and always prompt in assisting us. I will definitely come back next time for more
5
I booked a table for 2 on 25th May 2017 for my wife's birthday surprise treat. She was elated upon arriving there. The food was great. I had requested for a birthday song and cake for her and the staff certainly did not disappoint. I am very delighted to have chosen Carousel for this occasion and I hope to return soon, maybe to try out High Tea
3
I expected the food to be above average quality since the restaurant is voted the Best Buffet Restaurant in Singapore at AsiaOne Peopleâ€™s Choice Awards for many years. However, most of the dishes are average in taste. The restaurant could improve its ambience to create a more satisfactory dining experience.
5
I LOVE this place! High-tea buffet is the best, with a wide variety of international food. Every year I head over for a celebratory meal at least 4 times and always "no regrets". Good ambience and fast service. I esp love their dessert and japanese corner. Keep it up
5
Loads of variety,the food tastes fresh. They top up the buffet in timely manner. Clear the plates & fill up the ice water without asking. All the staff are nice & approachable.
4
A good and nice place to dine and have gatherings as there are private corners for groups. Food is nice. variety to choose from. Beverages are good too.
5
Love the varieties, food was decent. Service is good. Will definite intro to friends to come to carousel.
4
Prompt to clear dishes while you replenish more. Good spread with a good handful of seafood ; lobster, oyster , crab. Especially loving the sashimi counter and the desert.
5
Good food, good service. Totally worth it with many seafood especially lobsters and oyster and long leg crab. And new ice cream counter with many interestibg flavours you cannot find elsewhere.
5
fresh seafood, loved the fatty salmon sashimi and the wide variety of spread, my Muslim friend loved it there! :)
5
This restaurant never fails to impress me everytime I visit.Food variety & quality are great.Things to try such as the sashimi, teppanyaki & the cold seafood.They also serve ice cream with interesting flavours such as kaya.Area is also big and able to take crowds.The wait staffs are prompt in clearing out plates.I will definitely return to this restaurant
5
table service was prompt & efficient. plastic ware & utensils are available for toddlers. Makes it enjoyable for the toddler w/out breaking any of the ceramic ware. typically over subscribed, hence early reservations is usually necessary. That says it all i guess that it's a place in demand
5
I love to dine in carousel. This would be my 4th time to dine there. This time i took my youngest sister to try. They provide wide variety of food. Fresh cold seafood available such fresh oyster, big prawns, crabs etc. You name it! Also japanese food, indian etc and the desserts are to die for. Good service. Best food. And its Halal. Please do make reservation though cos this place is always packed. No reservation and you hardly can get a seat. I made my reservation 2 days before i travelled to Singapore. And they do give cake and sing for bday boy and girl
5
There's nothing negative that I can possibly think of about Carousel. Everything is perfect from the service, to the food, ambiance, sincerity in going above and beyond in making sure the guests have a wonderful dining experience. The surprise birthday song and cake was a nice touch. Personally for me, the one thing that can always bring me back to Carousel is the Bread & Butter Pudding. I am a fan. It's soooooo delicious!! Please keep it up =)I was very impressed with the food and service that I've decided to hold this year's company dinner at Royal Plaza this November. Looking forward to having more delightful dishes from Carousel. Thank you
4
Not to miss their seafood counter n sashimi counter. Desserts counter could be better, as the taste of the dessert is just average only. But the variety is a lot, from Cakes to bread pudding and waffles plus ice cream.
4
Pretty good and generous buffet with prices to match. Seafood is the star here. Will recommend,especially when there is a promotion on.
4
Verity of delicious International Food to choose from. Recommended to ppl whom really can enjoy food. If not you it's not worth spending $$.
5
We had a good time..food is fresh,staffs r always ther wth their warm smile,feel at home n cosy..hhahhaa Tis my 4th times here,,awesome!!!❤️
5
Seafood and japanese food is good.
Prawn,crab, lobster and oyster was fresh.
Environment was good too.
One of the best halal restaurant buffet.
4
the staff is professional and polite - they even took the effort to perform for those who were celebrating their birthdays in the restaurant that day. The celebration was done sincerely and you could tell everyone was in a good mood because of it. Food: sushi was great. The salads were plated nicely. Loved the pan-fried potatoes in onion-herb marmalade. The briyani rice didn't feel heavy even after a hefty serving. Although I didn't have to try the rest of the Indian food since I'm of South Indian descent, I think it should have been placed more prominently next to the chicken rice and laksa stalls. Also, please look into South Indian food as well! :) A more diverse cheese platter (more than 4 types) would have been appreciated. The dessert could have been placed more prominently. More sauces could have been provided near the dessert area. I feel someone should be manning the chocolate fondue stations to ensure no one double dips - I saw some children without their parents who were double-dipping the marshmallows and profiteroles and making a mess of the station. All in all, I had a great time with my family and the service staff was responsive and polite. Thanks for the experience! :
5
Delicious seafood and wide selection of dessert. Therese of course food from various different cuisine but my favorite was the seafood and dessert. We came here for my mom's birthday and they made a special celebration by bringing out a cake and the staff sang to all the groups that were there to celebrate. The service was also really great. Overall a great experience!
5
Had dinner here on a weekend. Massive spread, some dishes that I did not get to try because I was too full. But there is pretty much everything. Seafood was really fresh and delicious. Had the best creme brulee in my life here too. Excellent service and truly a wonderful meal
5
As usual, Carousel's lunch buffet is a treat (though a little pricey) with so many choices and options. What made it more special were the Easter activities planned for kids, the reason we made the reservation. I was too tired to plan for the yearly Easter party for my daughter and thought it was a better idea to bring her out instead.It was an engaging play and fun within the restaurant for the kids and my 7 year old girl who was looking forward to the afternoon really enjoyed herself. It would have been more meaningful if the kids were given eggs to paint or egg chocolates to make or unwrap too (feedback for next year's Easter lunch perhaps). The person who was attending to our table (a matured Indian man- apologize that I've forgotten his name), was kind enough to get us some egg chocolates when my daughter saw other kids playing with their own. He also reminded us when the games were about to start so my daughter does not miss out on the fun. Wonderful service ! It's also awesome to watch the crew come together to sing and dance after delivering the birthday cakes. Well done carousel - It was a day to remember 
4
Had a very nice time, the restaurant was busy but not packed, I would say reservations are a must. The food was very good, it could have been a little hotter but was still wonderful. Sushi was very good but nothing seems to match the sushi we had in Brazil. There was a variety of options and some even specially prepared options. I would return the next time I pass thru. Enjoy!
5
From booking to dining experience, staff are ever willing to go the extra mile in service.Good range of cuisine to choose from. Wide range of desserts and all tasted wonderful (even to a non-dessert lover like me).
5
Lovely friendly staff, great food and great service! We had a large table for a family function and had a great time!
4
Pleasantly surprised by the birthday cake that the staff presented. Very well organised even though there were a few birthday customers on the same time slot. Came with a birthday song for all.
Staff cleared the plates very promptly without reminder. Excellent service.
5
One of the best buffets I've been to...worth it👍👍👍🥘🍲🥗🍛🍜🍤🍰🍮🍨🍦🍧☕🍥 and the cakes....sinfully good🤣
5
Came for lunch and was quite disappointed that the meal was average with not many varieties. I've personally been to a better restaurant offering a far wider spread at the same cost. Service was average and the staff kept asking us if they could clear our plates when it is quite clear that we are only half-way through
5
Our experience started on the previous day when we happened to call into the Royal Plaza to have a look around. We were approached by the head chef (Robert Mak) who impromptly gave use guided tour of the restaurant and all its amazing food stations. We had to make a booking and were not disappointed. Basically a two hour 'eat all you can' extravaganza. It is not possible to do this justice in only two hours but worth every dollar.The smile on Roberts face tells the story..you can see how much he enjoys what he has created and that his reflected in the wonderfull staff who gave an excellent cameo performance singing Happy Birthday to an unsuspecting guest. Thank You All....we will be back

Visited for birthday lunch whilst on holiday. Plenty of options and fine quality foods. Highlights were the seafood option and hot meats which were very well cooked. Great experience for birthday with attentive and friendly staff. Good atmosphere in the restaurant and $10 corkage for byo wine, overall cost great value for money in Singapore.
5
The seafood buffet is better than any I have experienced - and Las Vegas could take a tip from them. The assortment is huge and not just seafood, but a wide assortment of cuisines and non-fish offerings. My favourites are the fresh oysters, sushi, chilli crab with steamed bread, the Thai seafood, the Indian selection and the smoked duck salad, The dessert counter has an innovative and delicious assortment. Be sure to try their macaroons. The Staff is wonderful. they clear dishes with dazzling speed and are happy to make recommendations. For birthdays the restaurant offers complimentary cake and a musical interlude featuring the Staff doing an upbeat version of "Happy Birthday"! Our favourite table is along the glass windows facing Scotts Road. Resevarions are essential on weekends

My mom and I are foodies! So when we found out about Carousel buffet being the best buffet in Singapore, we couldn't miss it!! We booked for a lunch buffet. There was a great spread. Everything is delicious!! From the seafood, to teppanyaki and the various selection of ice cream and dessert!! It was amazing!! Can't wait to come back. We just hope that the pasta station would add some meat in it instead of just the sauce. E.i. Some beef, shrimp, chicken or chicken bacon. The pasta is a bit bland.

My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary in Royal Plaza and one of the highlights is to have a dinner buffet at the Carousel. We received a surprised cake, and the staffs there are very welcoming.. Specially Lena, she even introduced the buffet varieties before leading us to our seat.. its like a very ''special" treatment for us. It's Pricey but worth it! :
4
The buffet spread and quality of food were decent, service was prompt. They do happen to offer certain promotions now and then. But overall, didn't feel there was anything particularly good or spectacular with the food or environment, and parking can be a chore sometimes.
5
Love the seafood and dessert spread. I found all the items to be delicately and wonderfully prepared. It's a great setting for both business and family occasion. I would definitely count it one of my buffet favorites.
5
Make a reservation on the weekend for our anniversary celebration. Friendly and approachable staff. Wide variety of food. Totally impressed with the food. Awesome dining experience. Highly recommended.
5
A bit more expensive than other buffets but the choice on offer is splendid. Seafood counter was fabulous. So many food varieties available and staff very friendly
5
Always great food, great service. Had a wonderful experience. Lunch, hi tea or dinner, Carousel always delivers. Our family 1st choice of restaurant in Singapore.
4
This is buffet restaurant. I was there for late lunch around 3:30pm. They served "afternoon tea" I was quite surprised they work at this time of the day, as many places didn't.The food was good and variety is there. there was Indian, Japanese and western. Not much choice of juices. 
5
Have visited on numerous occasions including breakfasts while staying at the Royal plaza hotel. I've actually requested to stay at the hotel on business trips for the buffet. Since moving to Singapore, our family has returned on numerous occasions. It always has something for everyone and the chilled seafood and desserts are the best for any buffet I've ever visited
5
Carousel is is always one of my top go-to buffet place be it during a special occasion or not. The service and the quality of the cuisines keeps me coming back for more! Special shoutout to Chef Robert for his undying passion in cooking and also for serving one of the best Aglio Olio I have ever had! Must try includes aglio olio, fresh lobsters & wide array of desserts
4
Great dining place as usual .It is one of our favourites as always...love the varieties of food esp the seafood n salad section...but I must say the ambience can be improved .The seating in the resturant is pretty cramp so probably ,not so ideal for catching up but good n delicious food ,you are in for it
5
Has always been the go to place for halal buffet. Dare to say that this is the best halal buffet restaurant in Singapore. Highly recommended especially for the dinner. Variety of food and service of all the staffs are superb.. Bread pudding and the creme brulee fantastic.
4
Food: Wide spread of food varieties with simply delicious dessets.
Ambience: Spacious floor and seating arrangement. Classy decoration.
Price: Value for money.
4
Made a reservation for weekday lunch, was promptly directed to our table.
First visit here, so i'm quite impressed by the spread. Personal favourites:
The sashimi counter, teppanyaki, western cuisine, indian cuisine, desserts section (with the chocolate fondue fountain!)
3
Overall my friends & I enjoyed our Hi-Tea there. That day was quite full house, the Restaurant did a great dance to sing & dance for birthday customer
5
Thank you for making my mum's birthday celebration special. She loves the cake, the dance from the crew and the wonderful buffet spread. A big thank you to Mathi, who has made it possible. We will be back for more!
3
We find the food spread to be average. It was not worth the high price which we've paid. But the place was still crowded so apparently there are people love such food spread.
5
Stayed at the Hotel and the food here was absolutely amazing - daughter is a bit of a fussy eater in what she can eat or likes to eat - but here there was plenty of choice - Mmmmm - wish I could visit again - one day maybe
5
Make a reservation on the weekend for my boyfriend birthday. The staff was amazing, they surprise us with the cakes and to everyone who celebrate their birthday on that day..they were dancing,clapping and cheering.. Awesome stuff,awesome service and awesome food.. Love love loveee the chocolate fondue and Caviar !
5
I really enjoyed the birthday lunch for my boyfriend over at carousel the other day. The foods spreads are so nice and amazing. Same goes to the staff there that are very efficient, fast and friendly. They also gave a surprise birthday cake for my boyfriend and sang the birthday song and its free for the cake!. I'm so touched by their works. The price is abit pricy but worth the foods. Will recommend my friends and families. GOOD JOB CAROUSEL
5
Our family had an enjoyable double birthday celebration at Carousel!! The seafood was very fresh. Spread is extensive with something for everyone. Would highly recommend. This is not our first visit and will definitely not be the last. Thanks much for the birthday song and dance item by the service crew!!
5
My husband and myself brought our family for lunch to celebrate my father in law's birthday. Loved the range of choices laid out and the food was good. Dessert spread was my favourite. Special thanks to the staffs who were doing a great job and attentive. And thanks for the birthday song by the team delivered together with the complimentary cake. Thank You to the team who worked hard to make our dining experience wonderful
5
Had a birthday celebration there. They started dancing & singing at 8pm. Caught my friend in surprise. Good ambience and vibe.
5
The food and service was excellent! They got the cutleries ready for cake cutting without asking when they present the birthday cake. Most restaurants, even some "fine dining" restaurants might not have such common sense services.
5
Celebrated my 15 year old daughter's birthday. A slice of cake was presented to her. We love the two types of oysters and the fresh sashimi.
4
Visiting the outlet was suggested by the birthday boy himself. Food was good as usual.. Sufficient for hi tea spread.
2
always full of different nationality's just not westerners the food was not to our liking and quite expensive.
5
Such a delight to the palette; so much to choose from. Wow! Had I been a bigger eater, I would have savoured everything. And the one I had were delicious. Great service too despite the huge crowd. Kudos!
5
Great spread, wonderful staff as always. Never regret my choice after each meal. Will definitely come back again and again.👍👍
5
The location was definitely very convenient, just a few minutes walk from the MRT. The service staff were very observant and efficient in clearing the dirty plates on your dining table. There is also a wide variety of food options from seafood to japanese and many others. The food was also fresh which is a plus point! I also like that the staff and chefs would come together and sing birthday song for the customers. When I was making payment, I am surprised they would address me by my name which other restaurants I went to would not. Overall, it was a great experience although it was quite pricey but I would still highly recommend everyone to give it a try! Good job to the team at Carousel! (
5
Wide variety of foods! Free flow Sjora mango juice. The dessert counter is to die for especially the chocolate lava cake and the bread & butter pudding with vanilla sauce! You can always find an amazing cold seafood counter as well as Malay, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Mediterranean stations with plenty of dishes

The one good reason to be having lunch, tea or dinner at Carousel Buffet is the close proximity to the famous Orchard Road area, where there's also abundance shopping, people watching and .....more of other delicious eateries around, too.Carousel Buffet is definitely not a indulgence to be missed. For the per person buffet price at around $75.00 for lunch is not the cheapest around hotel restaurant prices, but certainly worth the eating experience there. There's a huge variety of Western, Chinese, Indian, Peranakan, and also Japanese cuisine.....and the selections of seafoods, meats, poultry AND .....to die for, are the sumptious display of traditional and avant-garde (fusion-style) desserts. It's certainly a restaurant which caters for everyone, young and old, where there's also a well-thought menu aside for kids age 5 to 9 years. The tables and chairs are arranged with good walking spaces in between, and laid out for 2-to-dine, small groups of 4 people at cosy corners, and individual rooms for groups of more than 10 people to relax and enjoy their eating experience there. There are attentive chefs at each cooking station that will look after your noodle needs, barbecue meats and responsible waiters always topping up the drinks, salads and soups. Be prepared to have at least 3 hours at Carousel Buffet to take your time to fully appreciate the wonderful spread. I wish to mention another wonderful reason to eat at Carousel Buffet is that is HALAL certified, where Muslims can freely indulge, too
5
Seafood were fresh and always replenished. Staff were very attentive, refilling our glasses often and quick in clearing the dirty plates.
5
The staffs were very friendly and the food was all amazing. The range and selection of the food was amazing. It was a plus point that there is a prayer room for muslims who dine there. It was a great experience overall.
5
The range and selection was astounding. But you have only one stomach. It is obviously pricey, so go there only if you deserve a real treat. You will not be able to eat everything.
5
Excellent food at great price! Level of service is beyond of our expectations! The staffs even prepared a surprise & cake for my birthday boy!
2
Crowded, expensive and seafood selection not as wide as the advertising leads one to believe. Better value across the road .
3
Have been here twice for kids birthdays - both times they've loved the eat-all-you-want sushi and deserts. Main courses are mostly Malay dishes - fun to try but pretty expensive and a bit mediocre compared to other establishments who cook better for less
4
Had a lovely time at Carousel with colleagues. We were given a lovely room for a group of 11. I was pleasantly surprised at the large selection of Asian and western tea-time treats. Seafood was fresh, popiah was good and desserts, particularly the chocolate pudding, were great.
5
Took my Beautiful Wife Bela. As a Birthday Treat. The Food was Out Of this World. The all in meal had the best Sea Food including : Lobster, Crab, Large Prawns. 8 different types of Shell Fish. Including Oysters. The Main Course,s had a huge selection of multi National Dishes Including: Indian, Chinese, Japanese. But the Very best of all. The Desserts including:a Sumptuously Chocolate Fountain with dipping item (Strawberry. Apricot. Marshmallow etc.) There we're Cakes. Cream caramel. Frogurt. There is also a large selection of Cheeses available. With crisp biscuits and Grapes. Will we be back... Oh Hell Yes!
4
A good spread of food from eastern to western and different ethnic groups. Seafood was not as much as before. A lot of people therefore the food was not replenish fast enough to feed hungry diners. The taste of some food items was also not up to standard
5
The ambience of the restaurant is fantastically clean, attractive and colourful. The varieties of fresh seafood provided are simply: first-class, looks lively and taste awesomely delicious.My favourite: all kinds of fresh sashimiYou simply just can't finish all kinds of food and desserts at one visit. One important tip: don't drink too much water or juices and consume minimum amount of soup so that you can fill your stomach with all the food, fruits and desserts at the buffet stations
5
Enjoyed a lovely breakfast as hotel guest. Omelette station very good. I've never seen a chef work so fast and cook an excellent Omelette.
5
Food was good. Service was excellent. Cant ask for more. Will definitely come back again. Thumbs up!
5
Every time I dine for buffet in Carousel, I will not be disappointed. Hope that they maintain the quality of buffet served.
4
The buffet here is much talked about , I'd say it's value for money when you're looking to eat big! Will repeat
5
One of the few good buffets in town. Have been visting Carousel for years and it did not let me down every single time im there.
5
My tittle sums up the experience i had.Was a little hesistant to reserve the place for dinner due to previous experience.However, that was years ago & anyway wife was craving to dine there, so make reservation online for 2 adults & 2children.To summarise:Service: 5 star out of 5Staff was helpful , nice & available always for assistance.Ambience: 5 star out of 5Compare to years ago, its much spacious now & there's plenty of tables available.Deco & furnishing were in line with 5 star hotel standards , no surpises as they're located within a 5 star hotel.Food: 4.5 stars of 5Great variety, size of seafood & meat are much larger in size compare to its competitors.Taste delicious, ive had secondhelping for all that is served, except it's cakes as i dun really fancy them.Only downside, could serve a lil more asian exotic cuisine. Price: Though quite expensive , but its still worth.Money well spend i say.Recomended for food lovers as well as tourist staying around the vicinity
5
i went for a high tea to celebrate my gf bdae on 4/3/17. the food was awesome, service was great! the waiter Mr Fauzie (hope to get his name correct) is very anticipating towards our need! also a staff frm the cashier remembers my name. one word: outstanding! thank you Carousel!
3
This Halal restaurant is very popular and you need to book in advance. We booked for lunch there in anticipation of a great time but the experience fell short. Food quality was okay, not bad but not particularly outstanding and there was not enough variety. The staff was friendly but the ambience smacks more of a high school cafe. There was constant enthusiastic clapping and singing of birthday songs for diners celebrating their birthdays there. Even Swenson's isn't this bad. It was just too noisy to relax and enjoy the food
2
My Muslim colleagues and I selected this restaurant as it was certified halal. $97 nett per person was a very costly dinner and not worth the money. The oysters were so so. The steam lobsters and crabs were so tough and dry. The cooked dishes didn't sit well with me as we found it salty.The waiter who served/cleared our table was rather grumpy as we didn't stacked all the plates for him to clear. He said next time put all the plates together!Hmm...we won't come again
4
An immense range of foods of many different cuisines in a pleasant environment. I enjoyed shellfish, sashimi, duck, roasts, Indian foods and a delightful collection of sweets. The food did not get a chance to get tired, as sometimes happens in buffets, and staff were careful to make sure this was the case. Staff generally were very helpful, and I generally recommend this buffet with few reservations. (Perhaps the only reservation is the price: it's not cheap, but to get a range of this kind and this quality with this level of service is not cheap.) As I stayed at the hotel, I also enjoyed breakfasts here as well, and found that the range and quality of foods were very good
4
The Breakfast was very good with a wide selection of western & Chinese items.
Dinner was excellent with a wide selection of sea food very well prepared in different flavours. The Japanese action station was excellent with different types of Sushi , Sashimi & Teppanyaki.
5
Nice selection of food spread. Svc crew was very attentive to our table. They even sang birthday song, give a complimentary slice of bday cake & took a pic of me & family & send it to me via email.
Well done Carousel!
5
Having been to this buffet for several years now, the service is consistently very good and so is the food. Always a great experience.
5
Carousel has never disappoint me! Food was yummy as usual. Managed to gv a suprise birthday celebration to my cousin. Thanks to Carousel Staff even though it was a last minute!
5
the spread of the food is amazing. they have many food from different culture . you will be spoilt by choice
5
If you go out on empty stomach - you did something wrong ;)
There is absolutely something for every taste - enjoy!
5
First of all, don't think of the price. Every bit is worth of the money. You will find anything you likeand more. You can check the price in their website. We ate there during dinner. I didn't know what to eat and keep space in my tummy for what hhhhh. Everything is delecious and beautiful. Always refreshed. Always served with smile. Drinks are always refilled. Dishes always been cleared on your table by the time you roomed around for another dish. Eat all you can. Bcos We did and we enjoyed every bit of it. We will defiantly going back to it. Ah those fresh meet and sea food ! Absolutely recommending it. Stop reading just book now. Hhhhh you won't regret
4
We ate at the Carousel buffet a couple of times as one of the benefits of booking the club level at the hotel. The quality and varied of the food was very good. But we missed some of the foods we are used to, like bacon and bagels and cream cheese. Service in the restaurant is very good
5
Since this is my FAVORITE Buffet in Singapore,im back for my 10th time.This time is with my housemates.The food is still in its best quality,and the best part, is that after 5 years ofmy continous patronage to this place,im happy to see my FAVORITE CHEF,still there, with his beautiful smile to everyone.You'll feel the joy in what he's doing,so your pasta sure nice 1.Chef Robert handles the pasta section, so happyto see him. Will come back again.
5
Went to Carousel to celebrate my engagement with my fiancé, his birthday & valentines day as well. Had a special request to arrange a cake for my fiancé and Carousel's team did not disappoint me! My fiancé was really shocked by the surprise, all thanks to the team! Good thing about the Carousel is, it's Halal & there's a wide range of foods that you're able to pick. Chocolate Fondue makes it a plus point cos that's my favourite! Told my fiancé that we'd probably be back again to celebrate our special occasions! Indeed, the best restaurant I've been! Thank you to all Carousel team for making the surprise happened! Will be back soon
5
The buffet spread was good for Hi-tea and I am surprised that the staff can remember my name! Very impressed and will definitely come back again with my family ..... :)
5
I'm told it's owned by the Sultan of Brunei, well thanks Sultan, excellent spread. All you could want and all you can eat, great.
5
It was yet another wonderful dining experience at carousel. The buffet options have always been excellent - especially the seafood choices.
The people are always friendly and ready to help.
I will definitely come back for more.
5
They arranged that all of us sit together. The spread was good, not the usual cakes & small bites found in other hi-tea. All my business Associates enjoyed the lo-hei.
3
Carousel used to be one of the best buffet places to go to in Singapore. Over the years, I think the standards have been slowly declining. Perhaps the increased capacity resulted in inability to keep up. Nonetheless, a place worth checking out.
4
Enjoyed the cold seafood, Japanese section and desserts. Though crowded, most items were replenished quite quickly.
Didn't managed to try all items offered as was feeling stuffed :)
2
For the price paid, the atmosphere gave us a mass market feel. The place was a little overcrowded and the food was so-so. First time we tried this place. We are unlikely to come again
5
We stayed at the Royal Plaza on Scotts, the breakfast in the buffet was delicious there was every kind of food that you wanted. We enjoyed the Asian style breakfast which included laksa and noodles...a bit early in the day but absolutely yummy...they also have European type breakfasts...ceareals, pastries, eggs etc. if you couldn't find something to enjoy at this breakfast then there is something wrong..
4
On 27 January 2017 (Friday), which was Lunar New Year eve, visited Carousel Restaurant located at Royal Plaza at Scotts.Clean cosy restaurant on level 1 at the entrance of the hotel. Picked up the Mcquire Chocolate Cake. Rich chocolate mousse on upper layer, chocolate sponge cake with hazelnut on lower layer, chocolate fudge on the external. A great treat for all chocolate lover.Enjoyed the cake with the family during the lunar new year. Will order again
4
I visited Carousel again recently during the CNY period to celebrate my mother's birthday. We went expecting a great hi-tea buffet and ended up getting wow-ed by the staff and attentive service instead. While the food was okay, the staff made us feel like royalty and even served my mother a birthday cake. :) What impressed me the most, was the nice Malay server tagged to our table. While we had 3 adults and 2 kids at our table, she noticed my son wasn't really eating and suggested we get billed for 3 adults and only 1 child. On top of that, they gave me a 10% discount because I used a DBS card to pay. Truly memorable, and we look forward to the next visit. :
2
very slow and food is not up to the par,
the standard of food have drop
wont recommend to my family/friends to dine in here.
4
Great buffet spread with fresh seafood.
Was average when I dined here several years ago. Now much better than before.
5
We had a great time for our staycation for 3days 2nites. We enjoyed our buffet dinner at Carousel. With the friendly staffs and good service. Thank you for the complimentary birthday cake and also your birthday dance.
We enjoyed ourselves!
5
Good food . Worth the $$ . Except the dessert spread could be improved. More varities of cakes .overall service good
4
Lots of Halal Food to Choose From! We both can't decide what to have but ended up stuffing our face onyo Seafoods like Oysters, Crabs and Prawns.. you'll definitely spoil for choice!!!
5
A lot of nice food, service is good and staff are helpful .Upon reservation, they do check with you any special event for this booking. They do put in a lot of effort to celebrate your stated event....it is nice and warm to have such a though for the customer
3
We had a high tea buffet there at 3.30 p.m. There was plenty of same stuff, as in the lunch buffet. The Japanese and the sea food corners were good. Other food was just basic good. We were surprised of the very small variety of sweet dishes/desserts on display, as we have seen buffet places like this with so many different sweet (and other) choices. Dirty plates were moved quickly, so no complaints about that. This place is only for (heavy) eating. Go there with empty stomac. No need for any companionship, as you'll only be eating there. Only things we told to each other were 'Another round' and 'Yes' ;) Good and fresh food. Not a 'High tea', but at least 'Good tea'
3
There was quite a good spread of food - from sashimi, sushi, seafood, small cheese selection, to other cooked foods and dessert. However, the quality of the food were below expectations. The crayfish had a very fishy smell and other seafood and raw fish were not very fresh. The cooked food were generally ok, but could be better. The meats were especially tough, especially the braised duck and lamb. Dessert was ok, a good spread but not memorable. Come here for the spread, but I will suggest trying other hotel buffets in the area of Orchard Road. The redeeming point was the service - which was excellent. Our plates were cleared very quickly and the staff were very accommodating, friendly and helpful
3
We were staying at the Royal plaza on Scott's and this is so conveniently located that we only wanted to try. The price is daunting for breakfast but the selection is generous and the food is cooked very american style. If you crave American comfort foods in the am, then this is right up your alley, if you are more open to suggestions there are many very nice places close by, that IMO present better choices and valu
5
Had our first visit at Carousel to celebrate husband's birthday dinner on 18 Jan. Totally satisfied with the excellent service rendered by Carousel. First, they did several follow up calls to check if we are on our way. At 8pm they did mini performance for all birthday babies in the house and present a slice of cake. The atmosphere at that moment was simply joyful! They even took photo of us and emailed to us. This is definitely a great service which not all restaurants provide. The spread was great and value for money. Additionally there was 10% discount for credit card payment. Downside is only when oyster bar was left empty without top up from 9pm-9.30pm. Tried to look for chef to assist but no where could be seen. Overall, great service you got there Carousel! Thumbs up! Will return for more
5
Excellent experience with good food, good service, free slice of cake for my birthday! My family enjoyed the meal there.
4
Carousel Buffet is a top rated and awarded restaurant in Singapore and has a huge array and variety of foods to choose from. A little bit pricey but well worth it for the hungry and those with a big appetite.
3
Service was a bit slow given the crowd on a Sunday afternoon but love how they played nice music to celebrate birthdays for customers. Choice of different cuisine is okay, the chicken rice is especially good, desserts are mediocre, overall average ...
5
Most memorable place to celebrate my 30th Wedding Anniversary at Carousel.
Enjoy the food and the atmosphere with the staff singing and dancing to celebrate the event. Thank you so much for organising the event for us
5
My family has been a regular at this restaurant. Carousel has managed to maintain their quality of fresh seafood and all the cooked food. We love their desserts too, however, we were quite disappointed when we were not allowed to change our table which is next to the hot servers. After some commotion, the manager eventually allow us to change to the table that we desired
3
This was the second time both my wife and I had dinner at Carousel. We booked 3 months in advance and, based on our previous meal, we were very excited to eat there.The Japanese and Seafood stations were pretty good - not outstanding. The rest of the stations were very disappointing. Many of them had empty serving dishes and many of the meals that were available were cold. Unacceptable. The desserts were quite good but again, nothing outstanding.I would probably be more forgiving if not for the $75 per head cost - quite high for a buffet.The staff were very friendly and extremely efficient - no complaints there at all. In comparison to our previous meal, however, we were very disappointed.
3
As a seafood lover the buffet was expected to be one of the trip highlights, sadly not to be. In my opinion some of the seafood was dry (lobster) & over cooked ( prawns). The scallops did not look appetising and although my favourite stayed on ice! I can however say the oysters were excellent. The salad bar was quite limited and depleted every time I passed. The prime rib of beef looked good and Initially made my husband who is not a seafood lover happy until he realised there was very little he could put with it to make a meal. Overall with buffet for 2 people, 1 coke and 1 beer came to £115. I can truthfully and honestly say I have had better on an all inclusive holiday in Greece
5
I can highly recommend Carousel, it was lovely and so much variety of food to compliment to each persons taste, service was excellent and they were quick to take away a used plate and refill water glasses. Although I hadn't told them it was my birthday, my friend sneakily asked them if they could sing to me like they had done with the previous 3 tables that were celebrating birthdays as well, the member of waiting staff was on hand to take a picture and was sent to me promptly by email. I would say it is worth checking out Carousel.
5
I have visit Singapore every couple of years and must admit I am normally hooked on the street food and food courts. As we were staying at the Royal Plaza on Scotts I discovered the hotel buffet was highly rated so we gave it a go.In short I was very impressed. The cost was £50ish each and the quality was amazing. It was also an excellent choice for my wife who doesn't eat meat. The fish and lobster was my favourite and my wife was most impressed with the desserts.Alcohol was extra and like the rest of Singapore it was expensive.I definately recommend this place and suggest you book
2
Went there for a work dinner. Ambience and deco feels more like a canteen, with a touch of tackiness.Quality: Rather average to poor, macaroons had frozen fillings, chilli crab meat isnt fresh, flesh all stuck to the shell, drunken prawn soup was way too salty.$80-85 per head after taxes for weekday dinner, there are much better choices which are also hala
5
I had lunch here with my son. The selection was fantastic. Really fresh sushi, large selection of meats, seafood, salads and desserts. Would recommend if you want a varied buffet.
5
A memorable occasion with great food and efficient, personal service! The food was always quickly topped up and staff was always on hand to attend to us. Thank you!
4
Always enjoyable having a buffet team lunch here. The chicken rice (roasted) is tasty along with the seafood and sushi assortment. Enough hot dish variety to satisfy a few rounds and platefuls of food. Not to mention the dessert...
4
Spent a weekday dinner with family. There is different theme on each day. Ours are Spanish night which means all Spanish cuisine. In general are good, but nothing special and outstanding, and price is a bit expensive.
4
We went for tea time buffet, surprising even tea time they offer alots of variety and there is lobster as well. Also, birthday cake for the birthday babies.
4
Typically here for breakfast and whist the food and drink is still good, it is getting a bit tired. Good fruit and cereal selection but yoghurt is still the same style at 10+ years ago. Likewise the choice of juices (only orange and grapefruit are fresh) ... most hot food and breads are the same style as 10 years back. Needs to reinvent itself by adding in some changes in line with other top notch hotels ... artisan yoghurts, speciality coffees and teas, different hot dishes and a variety of juices. Also would be good if the choice of breads could be improved with typically only white brown and raisin breads for the last many years ... in saying all of this ... to be clear it is still very good but if you have been here more than a few times then the novelty wears off!
5
Visited Carousel with some gusts on 27 Dec 16. It is always homecoming to Carousel. The ever warm and courteous staff of Royal Plaza. Pleasant. They remember you by name. Mathi, Ruben, Sheralin - excellent examples of good, hardworking staff who think on their feet. No forgetting Abraham Tan, Chef Robert and Chef Darren. The year end selection on the buffet spread is excellent and lavish. One can savour a wider variety of dishes and sweet treats
4
The bread pudding, sashimi, fresh oysters, other sea food, indian curries, roast and grill, chocolate fondue are my favourites. Skip lunch to have dinner buffet here. Slim chance to get a table last minute. Ive seen tables for two but if youre 4 or more people, do make reservations at least a week ahead. Popular venue for birthday celebrations. Maybe cos the staff go the nine yards singing birthday songs with gusto.. do clap along even if you dont know the birthday person - makes for a fun and cheery environment. Great variety of good food. Price is reasonable even if a bit pricey. Parking is available. Otherwise public transport is convenient too.
4
The Carousel Buffet at the Royal Plaza at Scotts has been scoring pretty well with our family now for a number of years. We have always liked the spread and variety of dishes and this is probably one of the biggest draw for us - we really like variety and of course, quality of food, above all. Specifically, I am one who likes to taste a wide range of food before going for seconds or even third. In fact, there were times when I only sampled a narrower range of food, just because I really really liked them.The other big draw for us is the dessert. Don't believe it when others say there is always room for dessert. I suggest you plan your approach to ensure that you set aside quite some space for dessert. You will regret it if you don't

Well hats off to all the staff at the carousel , this is my second year of coming here for Xmas lunch and it's great, the staff are so efficient and friendly, I have been to many buffet lunches in the various restaurants in Singapore over the years and overall this is one of the best, keep up the good work guys
5
Been to Carousel for a couple of times but yesterday was my first experience dining in during high tea and festive season. Menu was great. Awesome food and very cosy atmosphere. Will definitely be back!! 😁
4
Good variety of buffet items and seafood to satisfy your all-you-can-eat appetite. Nice ambience for couples, friends and family.
5
Its incredible that a restaurant can have a huge variety of breakfast in one place. I started with Chinese then onto Indian and finally a Western Breakky. Just a little of each to try and yummo it was all good. Highly recommended.
5
We were lucky enough to have the breakfast and lunch buffet at Carousel. I don't think we've ever been to a buffet with so much choice, such quality and such great service! Absolutely deserving of all its awards!
5
Carousel has always been the best buffet for all occasions. Our family enjoyed the food that and the desserts are to die for! We will definitely come back very soon! Keep up the excellent job!
5
Amazing hospitality, attentiveness and genuinely friendly and caring staff. The food is everything one could hope for --Japanese, Indian, local delicacies and generous roasts with vegetables of all kinds, including brussels sprouts!!! Loads of seafoods and assorted meats. The desserts are super yummy; we were spoilt for choice The staff even sang for patrons celebrating birthdays and anniversaries THANK YOU CAROUSEL!!! We hope you see you agai

Booked dinner reservation just a day before I required it. Understand it is normally fully booked. To my surprise they called to say the booking was confirmed. Food was good. Lots of choices.. Ambience was good and so was the service. They even gave a mini birthday cake and took a photograph for us. Sent us the pic and I thought it added a personal touch, Will come back.. except that it is pricey
1
This has to be the worst ever experience of high tea. I would say avoid at all costs. I have no idea how this place merited its accolades. The atmosphere was as a cattle market with dim sum running out in 10 mins. The prawns were not deveined and mussels dirty. Someone is going to be seriously il
4
Booking experience was quite smooth. It was all automated. Initially I felt uncertain if it would be logged properly. So when I discovered a day before that 12pm lunch was indicated as tea at 3:30pm in a response email, u can imagine my panic! Fortunately, there was automated sms reminder for 12pm lunch. A person replied to my booking inquiry also turned out correct. So, the system was good.Actual day, seafood was fresh as the way I remembered in all my previous visits (weekdays). Surprised to see pretty large oysters, maybe only available on weekend. Wonderful! Love the indulgent desserts, yoghurt and fruits as healthier choices, wide selection for children.Birthday day lady = my ma was pleased with her food and the "very nice" bd cake. I love the dance that staff put up, very energetic and lots of smiles on their faces, we enjoyed their performance a lot!Thank you for the happy memories and nice complimentary photo sent to my mailbox. We will certainly visit again

I dont understand why a lot of people like the food its not great for what you pay and can expact in a 5 star hotel.Perhaps my mistake and this is only a 3 star hotel.In that case the food is okay but the price much to high for what you get.Service also not to great.Okay have a great meal and a big bill
4
Desserts were great! Fried fish also. However the roast beef and turkey were disappointing.
Special thanks to the staff... esp Fadzli, who was very attentive to our needs.
5
It wasn't my first time in This restaurant but it was my first time having high tea+Husband birthday celebration!
The foods was served fresh! Everything is superb!
I will surely comeback and bring more people to dine in here!
5
Great food, welcoming ambiance and professional, friendly staff. My 5th time dining here and I will surely be back.
5
The service was great, staffs were friendly & food was good.
Made a reservation and stated is for a birthday celebration, they celebrated for my husband with a cake & a birthday song. It was a great experience!
4
There are many different kind of dishes likes, sushi, seafood, indian cuisine and others.Then you end it with the sweet chocolaty taste like the macaroons, cakes.It's really niceq=)Good service.Overall, yup, it's pricey but please do try.
4
Service was great. Helpful and friendly staff. Didn't manage to get reservations for lunch due to too many people. Try the hi-tea instead. Very filling experience. 😁
5
The best buffet I've ever tried in Singapore. The wide selection of seafood, dessert (oh damn the desserts are amazing) and they added a few more counters that serves teppanyaki and Christmas selection.
5
Nice buffet, variety of food available in terms of sea food, veggies, meat, chicken items and desserts. Food lover will really enjoy the buffet dinner..yummy...
5
Carousel has always been our pick for celebratory dinners. The array of food never lets us down, best being crab claws, sashimi and roast beef. Though its desserts selection is the ultimate indulgent! Our dining experience is perfected by friendly and helpful staff. This easily makes Carousel the number one international buffet spot for us
5
One of the best experience we've had. We were here to celebrate my younger son's 10th birthday and the 4.20pm dance item and birthday song was a pleasant surprise. The family photo sent to my mailbox was a greater surprise! Thank you Carousel for such a wonderful Hi-Tea experience
5
Great selection to choose from and not expensive. The dining area is clean and well used. The bakery in the supermarket is very good
4
Wide range of seafood . I like how they serve birthday cake and song when you notify there is a birthday celebration going on . They also make it a point to send photos to us .
5
Every penny spent well...satisfied with the seafood and sashimi, they got turkey chicken as well..would recommend to try although the price are expensive :D
5
Cleared my wife birthday there, and honoured with a dance number by the staff along with a slice of birthday cake. The staff were friendly and the variety of food available are awesome.
5
Delicious cuisines from Asian food and has fresh food also, dessert, chocolate, ice cream all you can eat as much your stomach accept it..
5
Excellent service by staffs. Service with a smile made the atmosphere livelier. Not to forget surprise anniversary wishes to me & hubby.
5
A high tea that is so worth and value for amount charged. We were stuck with our meetings and deadline, without being able to catch the Lunch Buffet. The selection of food was acceptable with varieties and a great idea to pull our colleague/friends/families to have a proper and delicious meal should you guys are going for late lunch. We were under impression, high tea may not allow us with some proper nice meal choices or seafood selection but they prove us wrong! A great hospitality and prompt service and we will return for dinner for oyster soon! BRAVO CAROUSEL TEAM
5
I had an excellent lunch with my friend at Carousel. Excellent service from everyone - from the moment we stepped in and were ushered to our seats, to the time we stepped out of the restaurant. It was crowded and we were given a quiet corner to enjoy our lunch. The detail to attention was meticulous. Chef Robert Mak also surprised and presented us with a mouth-watering plate of roast beef with truffle, when the counter had finished dishing it out. The variety of food and dessert made us spoilt for choice. Thank you for setting the example for service exemplary

3 of us visited this buffet restaurant on a Saturday evening. We booked for a 6:30pm start and the restaurant closes at 9:30pm. Customer service was excellent. We were shown to our table and plates were cleaned away efficiently. One of our group was drinking warm water and her cup was regularly refilled. There is a good range of foods on offer. Saturday evening was so busy and it was difficult to get to some of the food and get the self service utensils. There was a great selection of seafood. The various stations had an offering of hot dishes which were European, Indian and Asian. It was not great for fish eaters and vegetarians. All we could find was a display of salad ingredients and a vegetable curry. There was no cooked fish on offer. The deserts were well displayed but not memorable. The buffet is not cheap costing around $90 including service and GST. We would not hurry back but if we did return it would definitely not be on a Saturday evening. It is a balance all restaurants strive for to maximise revenue though the number of covers served and making it comfortable for diners. It has to be said that our Singaporean friends love a good buffet
5
Right at the door, was greeted by a very bubbly guy, awesome food served as always. Birthday cake and oh, the fantastic dance by the staffs, chefs with "maracas" - so good! Customised birthday card with birthday wishes and photo of us (Totally fantastic!) Made the birthday celebration really sweet, thank you Carousel. Service just got better each time I'm back to dine with you. Perfectly happy! =
4
Had my anniversary dinner here. Staffs were friendly and made our dinner enjoyable.
Good place to fill up your stomachs!
5
Staff at Carousel (lunch) added a personal touch by presenting a slice of cake to mark a colleague's farewell. They took a picture of us and promptly sent it to my email address. Great service. Memorable experience.
4
Great staff ,and the FOOD IS AMAZING !!!! great choice and large range of different food items .
Enjoyed the buffet a few days ago ....loved it ....
5
Had joint birthday celebration for 3 persons in a group of 7 on 19th November 2016.p Full of fun with wide spreads of international menus and performance from Carousel staff and birthday songs for those celebrating their birthday. Good and efficient service, well done Carousel!!
3
the staffs were friendly and regularly clearing our plates to ensure we have space for new rounds of food. however, noticed that some food items were not being replenished after they were finished. would be good if there are staffs being assigned to each food counter to ensure that food items were replenished to avoid disappointments. Also, good to label some of the food items so that customers will know exactly what are they. the shabu-shabu section (sushi counter) did not specify what meat and we do not dare to try as we do not take beef. there is only 1 pot of japanese soup used for cooking the veg/mushrooms and the unknown meat.good to have a separate pot for non-beef cooking. they took and emailed us the pictures as part of birthday celebrations, but will be better if they have polariod cameras or photo-printer so that they can pass us the hard copies of the photos before we leave instead of emailing soft-copy

I came to attend a one day course at Royal Plaza Scotts and the buffet lunch at Carousel was included as part of the lesson package. I like such a lovely combination; learnt something from the course and had a 5-star sumptuous lunch at the same time. The only minus point is that after the heavy lunch, the blood circulation went a bit haywire - instead of keeping you alert, it went to the stomach to digest the food and the mind went into a blank when the trainer resumed her lesson.This is the second time I had my buffet meal here. The last time I came here was about five years ago when I came here for a grassroots' retreat and dinner. I remember the seating area was brightly and romantically lit and the fresh lobsters, crayfishes, prawns and the oysters `voluminously' flooded the display counters and appeared so appetizing and mouth-watering. This time, the amount was drastically reduced. The salmon and tuna were just meagerly few. I saw the staff poured out a bucket of crayfish but once the customers hurriedly finished them, there was no further replenishment. But the quantity of prawns was adequate. I heard my trainer asking the counter staff to replenish the tuna as there was not a single piece at the display counter. It was then that I knew there were tuna. The last time I came here five years ago, I remember seeing plenty of oysters on the buffet counter but now I only saw mussels not oysters. I was not sure if there was a difference between the lunch and the dinner menu. In terms of quantity on the buffet counter, it was a drastic gap between those on the voluptuous photographs provided by the management at this web site and what I actually saw at the buffet counter. The rest of the cooked food was the same as five years ago. The green tea yogurt was delicious. The varieties of sweet cakes and confectionary desserts were tempting. I had no qualm on the food standard and the service was prompt. The clearing of the plates were also fast and the waitresses were very well-dressed and good looking. While the standard at the seafood buffet counter has dropped a bit, particularly on the replenishment of the food items; I think the overall standard is still high. It is a good idea to organize short courses that incorporate a sumptuous lunch of this nature at the hotel

I will recommend this place for family or friends gathering.Good buffet spread. For diners who love seafood and oysters, this is the place to come.There is a wide variety of cook food. When a dish is finished at the buffet counter, it will be replaced by a different dish. You need to take more frequent walks to the buffet counters to check out new dishes.The few cooking counters offers a variety of food; such as Teppanyaki, Risotto and local food.The dessert counters offer a selections of Asian desserts and Western pastry. The variety and quality of dessert can be improved though. You can get coffee and tea from the few drink machines in the restaurant.It was a satisfying meal. Not the best buffet dinner i had in Singapore but will definitely recommend this restaurant to others. Especially for family and friends gathering
5
Family celebrated my brother's birthday on 20 Nov with a lunch buffet here. Incredible spread & quality of food was only surpassed by the excellent service provided by its friendly and courteous staff. Would like to give special thanks to Abraham Tan (F&B mgr) and his team of great staff who made our meal such a wonderfully memorable one (complete with a birthday song and dance!). My whole family thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience. Will most definitely be back again :
5
Lots of variety to choose. The seafood was fresh and the food was yummy. The desserts were delicious too. I didn't expect the staff bring us an anniversary cake for us and took pic of us. Friendly staff overall and great experience. Overall, everything was perfect! Thanks Carousel
5
We took a team of 30 people to the Carousel for a celebration dinner. The range, variety and quality of foods were excellent. Everything were well fresh and prepared, my team favorite were seafoods. Many had Indian dishes, the Italian foods bar was also popular. The desert bar were full of fruit, cake and ice cream.
5
Excellent Customer Service coupled with best selection of Asian/Western and most importantly healthy meals.
4
We love this place. We have been coming to Carousel for years.
Every members of the family birthday will be celebrated here.
Great service .... superb buffet spread !!
The seafood and Japanese food very good and the desert spread so yummy.
5
what was better than the awesome food was the staff! Friendly, polite, courteous, smiley etc. Really enjoyed it. The food could be replenished faster but other than that, considering how packed it was, there was enough food. Thank you very much for the bday surprise for my partner. The cake was lovely and the photos sent to us are really thoughtful. My partner really enjoyed the staff singing and dancing too! Im really happy with everything. Thank you for great service
5
Superlative ambience, quality food, tremendous variety and very friendly and helpful staff. What makes it even more exciting was the impromptu dance performance for daughter, Corrine, who turns 14 on that same evening. She loves every part of the dining experience and so do the rest of the family members
5
Went for the high tea spread for my dad's 55th birthday & it was superb! My dad enjoyed it very much. The food was so good I wish my stomach could fit more haha Very friendly staff too! A couple of them came over to wish my dad happy birthday, which was so sweet. They even help us snap a family photo & sent it to me via email. Well done
5
First time visit to Carousel Buffet (lunch) with my family. Celebrating dad n mum 's birthday.Nice, cozy deco n lightings, excellent service, friendly staffs. At 1.20pm the staffs sang for the mini birthday celebration (for all celebrating birthday there). Nice surprise for my dad b mum. Even took a family picture for us and send to us via email.Wide range of food and desserts. I can't say all the food taste excellent (lobster may be too salty for some, seems soaked too long in salt water; some of the desserts does not taste as nice as it seems). But prawns are excellent, sashimi are fresh, lasksa tasty, juicy and tender chicken, nice potato salad and creamy creme brune. Desserts r so tempting. And many more nice choices.In general, me and my family (age from 9-60yrs old) enjoyed the buffet and will definitely go back for a second visit
5
I'm an absolute buffet lover and this is hands down the best buffet I have ever been to. Extremely good value with amazing food and customer service. There is food here for everyone with sushi, loads of fresh seafood, roasts, Chinese, Vietnamese, pasta which is cooked in front of you, cooked seafood and much more! The desert selection is massive! The quality and freshness is incredible and I will defiantly return here with my family when we holiday in Singapore.
5
So far the best buffet in Singapore. The spread is great, not too much not too little. Our favourite is the seafood and Japanese section, mostly the whole Salmon! Carvings are delicious too especially those who loves beef. Dessert is not disappointing either. Worth the money! Staff are helpful and friendly. They'd sing you and give you a small birthday cake if anyone happens to be celebrating.Will always go back here <
4
We stayed at Hotel Jen Orchardgateway and payed for daily breakfast & so glad we did. We're a family of 4 with young kids and we never had to wait so that's a bonus! There's a great selection of food ranging from noodle station, ham & cheese, dim sum, cereals, eggs & bacon etcThe atmosphere is pleasant & there's a lovely outdoor space too.
4
This is suppose to be a buffet fanatics destination. Upon entering the restaurant, you can tell it was full of happy patrons, some there for celebrations, others were tourist such as ourselves, and then there were locals. The offerings were many but their seafood was the main draw. With that said, I was a bit dissapointed with many of the overcooked seafood: giant prawns, salmon, bass. Perhaps it was an off night for them but a lasting impression for me. I felt, for the price, the buffet offering were no better than what was offered in other restuarants. For the price, I diffinitely expected better
4
Me and my spouse just do not find the variety of food served worth the $180 that we paid for.. but other then that all the staff is friendly and their level of service deserves a thumbs up
4
Great buffet spot, good spread of food that never fails. Great service, fast & polite!! :) Definitely would recommend others to come!!!
5
This place is amazing. Friendly and helpful staffs. The service was so great. The sea food is fresh and desserts are very nice. We really love this place!!!
5
Always a go to buffet spot for occasions! Great value with very helpful staff and good food! Never fail to please the tummy!
5
Wide selection. Spolit of choice esp dessert lover. Service is gd. I like the display of food. $ may b a bit steep but still worth a try compare to some other 5star hotel buffet.
4
We celebrated my husband birhtday party in here. The foods are great, the service are great. My children who is 8 and 5 years old can't stop eating. They even sang a happy birthday song for my husband, that make my children so happy. For me it's the best halal buffet in tow
4
This is one of the best buffets in town.If you are a seafood lover like i'm than Carousel is a must.They have lobster, crab legs, oysters and many more sorts of seafood .One more thing that make carousel great is that they do not change a corkage fee for your first bottle of wine or champagne if you decide to bring you own
4
for good quality and variety it was hard to go past this food court , particularly as it was so close to our hotel. It also had a supermarket and cinema attached and was handy to other malls and open air cheap souvenier and clothes shopping
5
Fantastic dinner with a surprise Birthday Song and dance for Birthday ppl which make us think we`re celebrating a family members birthday.Service staff remain polite clearing tables while attending to request.Everthing from food to service very well done sp I have no regrets choosing Carousel over other restaurant ofr family dinner.Will be back for Birthday and other celebration for sure.THANK YO
5
I have been coming to Carousel to celebrate birthdays 4yr in a row. Never was I disappointed with the service or food. This time round, it's the same. Excellent service rendered. Food was really good. Love the cold dishes and also the bread butter pudding for desserts. Continue doing what you are doing. You have one happy family here supporting you. Thank you
5
Probably one of the best buffets ever!! Scrumptious food. Such fresh seafood. Wide range of spread. Was here for a company's lunch, though I wasnt feeling too well. But alls well that ends well (:
5
This was one of the best breakfast buffets which is available in Singapore. There are plenty of live counters to make specifically for you (eggs to order, noodle soups etc).
4
I stayed for one night In Royal Plaza hotel on Scott. I enjoyed very much the breakfast at Carousel Restaurant. The buffet serves American, chinese, indian and malay food. The nasi lemak taste was just right. Good food and good service too.
5
The food quality is really nice and fresh, would recommend friends to come. 👍 the price of the food is worth it
3
I was looking forward to the seafood spread but was letdown by the less than fresh seafood but the friendly staffs made my day with excellent service.
5
We went there for breakfast. The customer service is good and there are more varieties of food even it is for breakfast.
5
We had 3 nights at the RPS. Mind you, we ate out for dinners. But we had our brekkies here. Sensational. The choices were astounding - continental, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, seafood, breads, cheeses... and I guess for some, the most important thing - all halal. All brought together by their very attentive staff. Highly recommended if you want a top-notch buffet experience
4
Celebrated my eldest son's birthday by lunching there. Food was okay and service was pretty good. Staff were prompt in refilling water and clearing plates. The memorable part was the personalised service of serving a slice of cake to the birthday boy and staff taking photos for us. The photos were sent quickly to me via email. How efficient. I ordered a glass of drink and it was not included in the buffet price. Pricey for a glass of juice at SGD8. Raw oysters were not available hence was a tad disappointed. Felt the Asian food section was better overall. Dessert section had limited selection. Overall it was an okay experience for the kind of price paid.
5
If you love a variety of spreads, this is the place to go. The service is awesome, the spread is good and the Frozen Yogurt is the best. I can't stop eating it.My fiancee had a birthday song sang to her and it was all trippy (due to the lights) and happy. Overall, a good experience
4
I went to this place 2 nights in a row for a team reward dinner and both were good nights. It is halal however if one desires, one can order wine or beer from the hotel and lets face it, a great seafood feast is missing something when alcohol free The selection is wide, it's fresh and it never ends. I would suggest taking the lobster to the pasta station and getting them to an out of this world pasta creation. I tried it twice
5
Food spread was diversified....catered to every individual's taste....seafood, Japanese, Western/Local. Great dessert for those with sweet tooth. Staff were so friendly too.
5
We had a lovely birthday Dinner's celebration for our eldest son. Excellent Quality of Foods, Fresh Seafood, Friendly Staffs with good services and best part...Surprise Birthday Song for my son!! Thank you Carousel...:-)
4
Had a 3-day training stint at the hotel, lunch was at Carousel. Managed to sample a large selection of food here. Definitely worth a visit but probably not 3 days in a row.
4
This buffet will do the trick. Besides the usual seafood mix of crustaceans, shrimp, sushi/sashimi and shellfish, it has a great spread of cooked dishes including Indian and Singaporean fare. Desserts are quite good too and the breads are quite decent for a buffet.
4
The dessert spread was awesome! Especially the bread pudding :) Complimentary cake upon request was nice too! Thank you for the birthday song, Carousel staff.
5
The food is so fresh and to die for! There's not one dish that has not been cooked to perfection. Just a heavenly experience. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
5
Dinner spread was delicious! Cold seafood and asian has the best spread! Totally worth the price! Great and friendly staff!
4
mama loves buffet..and so we brought her to one of the best in town..supposedly ranked 1st(where shang's The Line is ranked 3rd). Selection was good..from cold cuts to japanese to italian to asian..the same applied to desserts. Service was top notch, which more than made up for the lack of food quality. Towards the end of the buffet, before it's last order time, there was sudden loud lively brazillian-like music and the staff started making a line and dancing to the lively tune..including the station chefs..n individual birthday cakes were then brought out to each birthday mama n papa followed by a lovely birthday song and table photo for each individual birthday mama n papa..wonderful and thoughtful service deserve kudos additional note that this is a halal-certified restaurant
4
One of our favorite family places to go for good value buffet. The staff offers excellent level of service. The spread of food is amazing. From seafood to sushi to western and oriental choices. The difficult feat to achieve is how to taste everything and not run out of stomach capacity. Booking is essential.
5
This is my first time when to Carousel. Excellent service from the staffs, very nice and friendly. Requested from them a small slice birthday cake for my friend and they prepared for us , SURPRISE BIRTHDAY SONG also sang to all the birthday people who come on that day too!! Thank you very much Carousel staffs!
5
There are a wide selection of foods for food lovers. The seafood section really marvelous. All the dishes and desserts are so tempting that one will not resist them. The staff's service are excellent. Overall, a happy and satisfying lunch.
5
What more could one ask for. Great Atmosphere with great selection of delicious foods.Staffs were attentive (Plus Point!)
5
Staff service is so oriented.... great food spread and was serve warm... definitely will come back..
5
Hi, went there yesterday to give a surprise birthday treat to a dear friend. Called to enquire but Christine(i hope i get name right) was super super friendly and helpful and professional and even say WELCOME BACK,cause i booked there before quite some time ago. The booking was done smoothly.Upon reaching, greeted by 2 females staffs and 1 indian man. All of them greeted me and hub with smiles and they are so approachable..suddenly they are like ur long time friends.. First time trying out their HIGH TEA and love the spread though some foods i missed...too full haha...overall super nice..newly renovated area look more spacious n bright.. Good job carousel, will never disappoint us. n one more cute thing now, they sent thank u email with our pics taken there using their ipad...awww so swee
5
Staying at Royal Plaza, was too lazy to head out for dinner so settled on the buffet. I'm usually very wary of buffets since they are generally more about quantity than quality. This place does both!The seafood available is fantastic and I'm glad they are constantly topping up all the oysters for me! :pThe desserts were amazing as well, one of the better ones.I am not a huge buffet fan, but this would rival the best buffets I've been to within Asia and Las Vegas
5
We had a dinner at Carousel buffet for my wife's birthday celebration. The food was fantastic especially the seafood. Fresh lobster, big crabs, mussels prawn oyster.. fantastic! Cooked food and dessert were also fantastic except the dimsum quality which was so so (but who cares because we came here for the seafood haha)At 8pm exact the crew threw music and dance for those celebrating birthday, which was a pleasant surprise for my wife. The crew took our picture, edited, and sent it by email. I must say this is a personalized service that I have not seen at other 5 star buffet. Fantastic service.Overall we had fantastic dinner and experience, no regret and Carousel will definitely be on top of our buffet list. Make sure you reserve in advance because it gets fully booked easily
5
I have been to many buffet restaurants in Singapore and I still find myself going back to Carousel . The great variety coupled with good service makes our visits memorable. Reservations are a breeze too! Kudos to the management , especially to Sherelin & Team 
5
The variety is astounding -- seafood, sushi, Middle Eastern, Western, Chinese, Indian. Also a variety of cheeses and desserts. More surprising is that the quality and taste are excellent considering the quantity put out. The ice creams are premium. Price is very good. They also allow you to bring one bottle of wine without corkage charge. Quite unbeatable, this place. It is especially popular among Muslims because it is one of very few places serving international cuisine that is halal. Staff compete with each other to be friendly and service-minded
5
Great selections of food! Staffs are super efficient and attentive. Surprise cake for a friend's bday and a welcome cake for another friend. At 8pm, the bells will sound and the staffs will come together stand in a line, sings and dances wishing all those who are celebrating birthdays. Great services! They took our photo and send us a copy via email with wishing notes on it. Superb! Will definitely come back again
5
We came for breakfast during our 4d3n stay at the hotel. The staffs were very friendly, helpful and approachable. The food and drinks menu has many variety. A lot of choices for my children too. The food are awesome. Also a happening and joyful place to celebrate birthdays. I happened to pass by the restaurant when the staffs were dancing and singing birthday symphony. Overall a very good choice to bring your family to
5
Quality of service, as usual, excellent! Good location as well and a wide variety of seafood to choose from. Highly recommended
4
Halah restaurant which offers us a good & wide variety when we were there for a friend's bday. Good service too by the staff
4
Being quite a buffet buff, i feel that this buffet is definitely worth its weight in its price as well as quality. Also located near to the shipping districts?
5
This is the out most perfect buffet I ever have eaten. Be awear that you probably have to reserve a table one day ahead. Howere, its a must to visit.
4
Good food and ambience.
Well done team.
Will come back again.
Good if can provide complimentary carpark.
5
Breakfast at carousel makes my day ! Exquisite choices with friendly staffs..from local cuisine to international...love it
5
60 USD for unlimited Sushi, Sashimi, Maki, Lobsters, Oysters, Shrimp, Octopus, Squid, and Crab legs is an amazing deal.Just be ready for wonderful taste and fast service. They have other food (Fish, chicken and beef) too in the back but it is not interesting to me
5
Good food good service. Varieties of the food are awesome. From starter until main course and dessert, it is a good selection buffet and good place for gathering. Dinner period until half way, the music on all the service and kitchen staff have a small performance for the birthday guest! It was the 1 st time i saw kitchen staff was joining! Good teamwork! And i believe they have a good management, because they are enjoy to give the performance to all the guest! Special thank you for the station staff, mr raja , miss crystal and mr adrian! Never let our table mess and the water glass never be empty! Good job all! Cheers!! (4th oct, dinner
4
The staff were very friendly and they were generous with their smile.The spread of food was great; yummy and quite a variety.The staff were quick to clear the plates on our table so that its not too cluttered. Also, they had a dance routine for the surprise birthday celebration. It was adorable! They didnt look like they were forced to dance though they probably were.All in all, great dining experience here. Will definitely come back again
3
My husband and I travelled a good distance to this restaurant on the strength of the reviews here but were very disappointed by what we found. For a place that charges 89$ each for a buffet, you don't expect a restaurant that looks like a staff canteen. Especially not one where so few eat. When we found out the price (we pay less for a Michelin starred restaurant in U.K.), we decided not to waste any time or money on such an overrated and over-priced place. There are plenty of places where the food is great and much cheaper...with the same canteen chic if that's your fancy
5
We had a wonderful dinner here, and also appreciate the nice surprise that they did for us. Excellent!
4
Very good spread of food and service was very good... Abit too crowded though . Love the extra mile taken by hotel to surprise all birthday folks with slice of cake n song. Well done

Standards high. Coffin Bay Oysters, Salmon from Tassie, loved the seafood & Sushi section of the buffet. Must pre-book for this restaurant.
4
This restaurant was very nice it was very busy we attended on a weekday. The service was impeccable and staff were very friendly. Large variety of delicious food to choose from.
3
The selection is huge here... Have something for everyone.
Prices are also affordable.
Quality is average.

We celebrated my friend's birthday at Carousel. The customer service was amazing. They were friendly and very efficient. I loved the sushi and seafood section. The buffet at carousel is always consistently good and tasty. All the different cuisine to try there was very nice. Thank you for the amazing service.

My colleague and I went here due to the reviews here. In my opinion it is overrated and the food was not of high quality. Typical buffet taste average. The seafood section was very good but the mains was a big let down.The costs for the buffet were not worthy

I'm American & my wife is Korean. We like totally different food, but we loved this buffet. She particularly dug the salad & sushi counters (there are,at least, five different such counters for lunch), while I went for the Indian & desserts. I did eat some of the huge salmon (the whole huge fish - eyeballs and all - was at the salad bar). You'd have to ask my wife how great the sushi was (although I know she did go back more than once!) The Indian nan was the highlight for me & my wife agreed that it was very delightful! I went back for seconds, so I was so full that I gave up trying the more traditional (for me) dishes of roast lamb & chicken. The creamy chicken curry did me in! There was a huge variety of desserts - so many that I don't think I could try them all even if I wanted. My favorite was the bread pudding. It was perhaps better than my grandmother used to make and that's saying a mouthful! Also of note, was the yogurt & cashew swirl ice cream.  The lunch price was over 60 dollars per person, but as luck would have it - it included the retrieval of my wife's forgotten phone. Wheh! That's service
3
Stopped at the Royal Plaza and opted for the buffet evening meal based on the many positive feedback comments. Have to say that the choice was very extensive, particularly if you are a fish lover, but the quality of the dishes were average. I know it's difficult to cater for large numbers with variety but having spent the b set part of $200 I would expect a lot more, and there are far better value options in Singapore for that money outlay
2
The breakfast came highly rated but did not measure up to its billing. There was a large selection of food on offer but I felt it was overpriced for the quality. Buffet is often difficult to serve up fresh and enticing and this lacked in both those areas. Pancakes and waffle choices were stale and cold, only three choices of fruit juice, all of which were standard supermarket branded. Better breakfasts are served for half the price demanded here.
4
Excellent selection of food without compromise of quality. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Cost is slightly steep but will be back because the food is really well made. Free $10 parking as well for people going for the high tea buffet.
5
Always a delight being here! Amazing food and the service is awesome. I find it refreshing as the food menu changes every now and then, but I am THANKFUL that they don't exclude their awesome bread pudding! It is the best! Trust me!
5
We had the buffet breakfast a couple of times and enjoyed the food. While there are omelet, scrambled eggs, bacon and the like, we tried the local fare consisting of Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese food (including fruits like longgans, rambutan and mangosteen) which were also available.
4
Seafood and Japanese spread were wonderful. My kids love the deserts though. Anyway overall food is good but the price is a bit on the high side. Maybe should add more selection of dishes to make the buffet dinner more worthwhile.
3
Interesting Family restaurant with something to eat for every one. Super variety in the buffet in a very very crowded restaurant yo need to book in advance. Food is good but not great
5
1st year of our marriage we did had our 1st lunch buffet in 2006, continued with our 5th wedding anniversary buffet dinner. On the 10th Sep 2016 we did our 10th wedding anni celebration buffet dinner there too. It will always be a joyful and lovely memories with Carousel at Royal on Scotts. Thank you for the lovely food and lovely team you have
5
We stayed three nights at Royal Plaza on Scotts in a premier room and had breakfast included with room.The restaurant is very spacious and we never had a problem being seated in the window to watch the world go by.Coffee service was prompt and we never had to find a attendant to request refills.As most reviewers have already stated the breakfast and food options are amazing and you will be very unlucky if you can not find something to start your day here.As the options were varied we were able to sample something different everyday, but always started with some fresh fruit which was always freshly cut and varied.Walking outside near to hotel there were other breakfast options, but for ease of dining and options the cost of dining in makes perfect sense
5
Been to Carousel and each time I can describe the experience in only 1 word.....Exceptional. The variety on offer is the best and the price you pay is truly worth it. One thing I always look out for in Carousel is their signature bread and butter pudding. It is second to none. Staff truly elevate your dining experience
4
I really recommend this place to visit for lunch. Why for lunch? I don't like to eat late and I like good lunch to feel nice all the day after. Extremely wide varieties of dishes and many choices from Japanese to Indian cousins. The final note - desserts - you will love all of them, tiny portions will allow you to try as many as you want, but my favorite - creme brulee with caramel crispy top. Very final - cup of coffee or piece of fruit...Yummy..Enjoy with family or friends. And what is important in this expensive city - the bill you will love too and will decide to visit them agai
4
Great place to have buffet. If you are staying at Royal Plaza, you can get the breakfast promo at 20 SGD. For lunch and dinner, its around 80 SGD. Selection is not as wide but seafood is great. Lastly, there is no pork on the menu
5
Went Carousel for my mum's birthday. Surprised by the warmth of the birthday song performance by the staff. Food is good. Service is fantastic. It was a very pleasant experience and definitely memorable for my birthday lady.
5
The buffet was huge and staff were preparing fresh fruit at the back to put on the buffet. Food was fresh and good and lots of choice.
5
We have been dinning in this restaurant so many times we lost count. The seafood is incredible tasty, especially the prawns. Service always professional and very quick to remove used plates once you got up from your table.
5
The hi tea was delicious and my kids love it coz of the chocolate fondue. The price is reasonable too. Carousel serve the best for every family retreat hope to come again.
5
One of the Halal International Buffet but Carousel boasts with a wide spread of seafood. Basically food is ok with variety of desserts too. However the seafood are mostly under cold dishes. Would b wonderful if theres more hot cooked seafood.
5
I tried countless of buffet in Singapore both high-end and not so, but nothing beats
carousel when it comes to the quality of the food.
The lobsters are ooh la la!!
4
This place is good for big group has there is a very large variety of food so everyone can eat what they like best. The sashimi was pretty fresh - altho it could be sliced thinner.With a few live stations as well, one is a little spoilt for choice on what to eat next
5
We had a lovely evening, filled with a warm welcome by your service staff, delicious food prepared by the chefs, good service of water refills, clearing of used plates & bill payment. We will definitely return to dine at Carousel Restaurant again. Many thanks to your Wonderful Team for a great dining experience!
4
The Best Teppanyaki and Fat crab I have ever tasted. The quality of food is great and fresh. Wide choices of good own made dessert...very presentable. However, the grilled snapper is a bit salty.Overall, I recommend this restaurant. One of the best buffet quality in town.Customer Service is also 
4
Loved this buffet because of the variety of unlimited seafood! Lobsters, clams, oysters, scallops, etc.There was also the usual Japanese spread, Indian and others. Plus a pasta kiosk where you choose your pasta and sauce and cooks will prepare it for you right there.The desserts are also a sight to see!I wasn't impressed with their roast beef area. Beef was a little too tough for me or perhaps I had the initial starting cuts which were a little more done than the middle parts of the meat.Carousel almost levels up to my favorite buffet at Rise in MBS. Hope to be back! :
4
Good spread of Halal International and local cuisines.
Good ambiance and services with free WiFi.
Prayers area available in the Hotel so you are not in a rush.
Good location just off Orchard Road.
Recommended for Business or family gathering.
5
nice buffet spread.....but can be improved with new menus. Good & attentive staffs, as always....keep it up Carousel...!!!!
4
Stayed here for 6 nights on business. Room came with breakfast and I must say that I enjoyed it. Self serve latte machine was a big plus for me.
4
Good quality buffet spread featuring sashimi, fresh seafood and a wide selection of cooked dishes and desserts. Worth the occasional splurge. Price per pax is about $70.
5
The buffet here sets the standard for buffets everywhere. It has many stations catering to every need and craving. Howver, the only problem is having enough stomach room to fit in all the delicious food. Yummy
5
Cozy ambience.
Friendly and thoughtful staff.
Showed us around the area and the difference cuisines available.
Even sent a photo of us celebrating our anniversary there.
4
We were here for weekday dinner. The the quality of buffet is good with wide selection of seafood, Japanese, Western and Asian food. The seafood served were fresh and delicious but the Japanese and Western spread were average. The prime rib and brisket were under seasoned. We enjoyed the desserts very much. There were wide variety of desserts to choose from. Staff were so friendly, helpful and attentive. We may be going again the next time we visit Singapore
5
Whether you are a guest of the hotel or not, this place is amazing. The selection of completely yummy food from all over is stunning. Added to that is a friendly staff and a veiw, outside the front windows overlooking Scott's Road that is a window on the world. The only small issue I have is that it can be a tad hard to get a second cup of coffee. That's my only beef. Otherwise, amazing food and a huge selection. On a personal note, I love the cheese selection!
5
Went to this place for the first time and we were surprised because they provided excellent service! I reserved a dinner for 2 with a birthday request for my fiancÃ¨. They gave a small show and a cake for those who are celebrating their birthday. We love the experience there ! It was worth the mone
5
Had a very satisfying dinner last night. The spread was good and really delicious. The service was great too. I was surprised when they presented me with a slice of birthday cake. Apparently, they checked with my hubby if we were celebrating any occasion when he called to make reservations. Thank you for the good initiative. :
5
Came here 3 times before. very good variety of food, sea food is fresh and desserts are nice. Very good dining experience for both leisure and business gathering. I like this place.
5
Location is in town and very accessible. Food spread is wide. Fresh live prawn in herbal soup is the best. Each live prawn are freshly cooked. Wide spread of Asia selection as well. Chinese to India and Japanese selection
5
First trip here with my GF for her birthday, was shown to our seats, introduction of all the food choices available which is quite new compared to other buffet places. Recommended definitely worth the money :)
5
My friend and I ate dinner last Saturday night. While the quality of food and variety is very good. What was a standout was the two wait staff Mas and Mega who were very friendly and delightful - they were very attentive and helpful and even cracked some jokes. At best most buffets in SG may have pleasant staff but more common is the wait staff who are either poorly trained or simply just want to be there. Congrats on having two great staff.The variety of seafood is one of the best (if not the best) in town. With crayfish, bugs, yabbies, prawns, scallops and three types of crabs, one is simply too spoilt. To top it off, the chilli crab was a good standard! There was a middle eastern area with dips, Japanese sashimi and sushi, lots of cooked food, noodle area, Indian corner, freshly cooked Spanish paella, etc.Desserts were also great w Choc pralines, macaroons, Choc fountain, ice cream, cakes, tarts, etc. This is simply an impressive spread, great staff with good quality food. I can see why it's won a lot of awards - keep up the great work
4
We visited here for a family anniversary. Service manager kindly gave us a small gift and took a family photo for us. Staff is all friendly and well served. Buffet is overall great and well mixed for western and asian foods. Good for casual lunch occasion
5
Went to Carousel last time I stayed in Singapore, as I stayed at Royal Plaza. This time we stayed in the apartments, so only came to Carousel for dinner (last time we ate both breakfast - included - and a dinner here). There was lots to choose from, including oysters from 3 places, which were shucked when you asked for them. My sister said the french oysters were particularly good and ate quite a few of them. There was a good selection of both hot and cold food, including a large array of desserts. I didn't try everything - there was just too much. All I can say is that everyone enjoyed themselves, including 1 of my aunts (who would normally not go to something like this, as it's quite expensive compared to other places she would normally go) and my baby niece - who loved the prawns, bread, cheese, noodles and various other things
5
I really love this place. Well, really love buffet food. I've been here a few times, and can't wait to come back again. Weekends are pretty expensive though. There are so many different cuisines to try out, sashimis, nasi lemak...all in the same restaurant. If you go with a large group, you can also get a private room. The best thing about it, is that it is all halal
5
The place has the reputation as being the best buffet in town. Yes it lives up to its reputation. You will be dazzled by the array of food and variety. If you are a sea food buff you will be pampered .Staff very professional and helpful Book early go early .place gets very full specially in weekend
5
This is the first time I visit to Carousel and the food at the carousel buffet was good and a lot of variety. I like the staff at the carousel, they are very friendly and efficient, beside that they are very helpful. One unexpected is the small surprise that prepare by them while we have enjoying our dinner at there, one of the staff send us a small cake for us for celebrating our anniversary. We have a great dinning experience and having a wonderful dinner at Carousel. Highly recommendation!!
4
The food is good a lot of variety.My kids enjoy it.I like the staff very friendly and efficient, specially AMAL she is so nice and very helpful.We are lucky enough that we went on weekdays because it's not too crowded and My family enjoy our time . Definitely coming back again
5
Prepared a private corner for our group when it learnt that we were there for a farewell for our colleague. Wide spread of food too!
5
Well organized. And thank you for the birthday surprise for my Husband 36th Birthday. Every occasion be it our wedding anniversary & birthdays of ours and our kids, we would sure to celebrate it by dining in Carousel.
5
Went for hi-tea and the spread of the buffet was good. The food is nice and service excellent, the wait staffs are friendly and warm. The staffs updated us on current promotion and there is also complimentary parking.
4
I enjoyed the wide variety at dinner buffet
U can find all kinds of cuisine , Japanese , Mediterranean , Indian , Chinese , local , Malay, Western , Seafood
Great selection of deserts too
3
Average buffet spread. Felt that Carousel standard has dropped over the years. Although they still serve an awesome variety of desserts.
4
Wide selection of food with various cuisines. Food is quickly replenished. Queues can be long on weekdays lunch hours so make a reservation in advance.
4
The bread and butter pudding is a must try, and the big spread of desserts make it good for family visits. Service was excellent, and the Indian food was quite good, though not great. The coffee machine coffee was also surprisingly good, compared to what one can commonly find in Singapore. But I'm no coffee afficionado though.For the rest, most of it is ok. Not good, but not bad either.All in all a good buffet, but very pricey
3
The spread is large, no question about it. The seafood station is probably the star. But having tried out a significant number of dishes across the different stations, nothing really stood out for me & frankly a week after my visit I did not remember most of what I ate. So this is average for me.
5
We had a staycation on the weekend at Royal Plaza Hotel and received a compliment buffet dinner and breakfast for 2.I've heard a lot of good feedback of their buffet before but this is the first I've tried and it is really worth it.They have so many choices of different food from asian to western. The seafood selection is very satisfying with choices from lobster, oyster, crab, prawn and many other. There are also choices of Japanese, Chinese & India food and not to mention many tasty pastry and ice cream for dessert.Breakfast buffet is as good as dinner, with selection of asian and western and choices of good cheese and fruits.The staff at the restaurant are friendly and very attentive. They clear the table and constantly replenish our drink.I am truly satisfied with their food both dinner and breakfast
3
We were there for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and were generally quite prompt in attending to our needs so thumbs up for the service. The crabs were really fresh and sweet but we didn't find the lobsters or oysters as good. The sashimi and hot dishes were alright in general but none were particularly memorable. The pastries and cakes definitely need improving though in terms of texture and taste
4
Went for dinner with a group of friends looking for halal food, and this was probably the best choice in the city.
Big spread of seafood and international food well prepared.
5
“It's always happy to dine there! You can feel the happiness surround every corner. Great foods, great staffs, great service!!!”
5
The Buffet spread was amazingly delicious and wide variety to choose from... love love love the bread pudding!! Staff was pretty awesome and we definitely coming back for more food indulgence!
5
We enjoyed the wide variety and high quality of the foods at the breakfast buffet. Favorite dishes were the creamed spinach and mushroom dish, and the chocolate croissants. Asian and Western foods were always available.
4
overall ambience is good, staff r friendly. However the spread should and could be improve on. HAve experience a much better spread during my previous visits.
Overall, still good but with room for improvement
Pls also provide the complimentary parking...
5
Attending the buffet was much more than what we anticipated. The choices of food were exceptional. The seafood section was some of the freshest and tastiest that we've had anywhere. Staff are all friendly and very accomodating. Service was impeccable. Would definitely recommend this buffet to anybody and everybody
4
For the price you pay, you get a good buffet spread. You do need to reserve seats early though, as it probably will be tough doing walk-ins. Both times I've gone, they were a full house. There is a very decent selection and variety of food. I particularly enjoyed their seafood selection, as well as their japanese selection. It was both fresh and tasty. Their hot foods were also really nice, with some unique varieties too. They also have live cuts/stations which was nice. I have to warn you though, it can get really crowded; and you may find some of the food running out fast, but the staff are quick to replenish it. I went in a group on both occasions, and it was really nice, since we could take our time to eat and leisurely catch up with one another.Overall, you get what you pay for.... depending on how much you can eat
4
Stayed many time for business trip. It is not a global brand but food id one of the best in Singapore, globally. Breakfast is fantastic. Lots of choice, Asian cusine and Europian. They serve good Indian food as well as Japanese and even some time Korean touch. Lunch buffet gives you more sellection and you will get weight
3
@TheKuoKnowsWith three outstanding eat-as-much-as-you-like buffets within walking distance of each other at the Orchard-end of Scotts Road, Carousel knows it cannot afford to slip up.Carousel offers an eclectic array of Asian fare. The sushi and sashimi, which are now a standard at most buffets, is adequate. Not spectacular, just adequate.The Beef Shabu Shabu is something you don't see very often at buffets. A refreshing addition.If the Shabu Shabu was refreshing, then the 65 degree egg was inspired. The softly-boiled egg, a staple of many a Singaporean breakfast table, is available for all to sample in all its quivering glory.The rest of the buffet, which includes the obligatory Hainanese Chicken Rice, the spread of Indian curries and the generous sample of local fare is good.Carousel doesn't disappoint. It's a safe option. But is that necessarily enough when its rivals are pushing the boat out
5
This was my second time to visit the Carousel buffet. And, as with my first visit, it was wonderful. It is not cheap, but you get an abundance of fresh seafood, from lobster to crab, shrimp to sushi. There is a whole bar of Chinese and Indian flavors, too. There is seafood with rice, fresh fish, roast beef, prime rib, several types of whole crab and crab legs. The dessert selection is extensive, including various cakes and puddings, ice cream, chocolate and strawberry fountains, petit fours, baklava, chocolates, etc. Tea, water and coffee come with the meal...all other drinks are extra. We paid with AMEX and rec'd a 10% discount. The total cost for two was around $160 Singapore dollars
5
Very good experience and the birthday greeting was very unique.
Buffet food serve very nice and plenty of choice wanted to have more..,
Preparation of food was very fresh and hot !
2
Ambiance - felt like a busy cafe.
Food - wide choice. Average quality.
Service - pleasant but poorly trained and slow.
Drinks - only one bottle of the chosen wine. Beer usual expensive hotel prices.
Price - expensive for the quality.
5
Once again, fantastic food and lots of variety. Love the ambience and friendly staffs. Thank you for making my birthday lunch an enjoyable one!
4
Good variety, one of the better Halal buffet in Singapore. Food quality is above average. Overall a great value-for-money. But the place can get too noisy to have a good conversation when the crowd comes in.
5
The atmosphere is awesome. Great n friendly staff. Lots of fresh varieties of good food. Will definitely visit again!
5
Awesome service and great variety of food, best place to celebrate any occasion or just feast your taste buds. All staffs are friendly and willing to attend your request with heart. Very highly recommended.
5
A place that never fails to please the palate and a sight to behold. It's my favorite buffet restaurant in Singapore.
4
Located within the Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel which is next to the Mega DFS Mall next door, the Carousel Buffet is IMHO one of the best halal buffet places in Singapore.Priced at around SGD$89.45 nett for dinner and SGD$65.91 nett for lunch, it is a little pricey but the value and quality that they provide is amazing!I love the variety of food from different cuisines and the seafood like oysters, steamed salmon and crabs and mini lobsters are fresh.Service is prompt and friendly and the mousse desserts are delectable!This place is popular for corporate lunches/dinners so I would recommend to book in advance so that you will not be disappointed
5
Excellent service, from the time you enter till you leave. Food awesome no words to describe how great the spread is, also money's worth. Tables cleared very quickly, service staff smilie and friendly.Reception and cashier friendly.One great place to choose to celebrate any occasion. Great place will always return and promote it to friends and family
3
First time trying the hi-tea, good spread but food was only average. The service staff are very friendly and there are always smile on their faces. Whereas the kitchen staff behind the station could improve on the service standards . Laksa and some local food could improve on the taste.
5
This was an incredible buffet - seafood, curries, pasta, sushi, asian, everything you could think of! The dessert buffet was on another level. The Singapore chilli crab was the highlight!!
4
Huge selection of food that range from Western to chinese to Indian and Japanese cuisine. Fresh seafood and nice desserts are available as well. Nice place to organize company/family gatherings.
5
Loved the buffet thoroughly. There was a lot of fresh seafood and wide variety of non seafood! The International buffet featured Very good desserts too!
4
The quality of food served is very satisfactory and the variety of food there is also good. We ate a ton of food and ended off with delectable dessert. It was a pleasurable experience.
4
Carousel offers a wide range of food! The lobsters and oysters were very food. Service staff claunious was very courteous and nice. Abraham was also friendly.
4
Dined here many times and continue to love coming to this place especially for their weekends high tea. Last visited was a few days ago. A great variety of food and the staff although busy were always attentive and courteous. They made us feel so welcomed everytime. Good job and keep it up Carousel
5
Booked the restaurant a day ahead for my Birthday and our 15th Wedding Anniversary and the staff (Ms Pinky) over the other end was extremely friendly and professional in handling my reservation. Immediately after our phone conversation, I received the email confirmation.On the actual day I even receive a reminder call from them which is to me very thoughtful of the restaurant.The night at the restaurant was great as not only they gave us a simple token of cake for our Wedding Anniversary, they also send another piece for my Birthday. All the staff working were extremely helpful, friendly and observant to every movement of the diners not only those celebrating occasion there.We will certainly come back to patronize this restaurant and also recommend it to all our friends and relatives.Keep up the excellent job
4
Staffs were very attentive and have great attitude (I felt they work with passion)from the moment we stepped in till the end of lunch. Food fresh, fine quality with good spread. We loves the spaghetti. Overall, we felt so comfortable and welcomed by the staffs. Will definitely visit again. Good job! Keep it up
3
This was my nth time visiting carousel. This time round was with my colleagues for a celebration and we had the lunch buffet.The quality has not disappoint me all these while and it's the same this time round. The cold seafood were fresh, the sashimi were good, the cooked food equally satisfactory. Service was good. Food were replenished timely and plates were cleared promptly.The only issue I have is the variety that seem to be the same everytime I am there. There is no need for me to look around for 'surprises' as there is none literally. As the spread is not that wide as compared to other restaurants where I cannot even sample everything available, it gets kinda boring after the 2nd visit. Lastly, the price is on the steep side even for lunch
5
If your Vitamin M allows, you can splurge yourself on the fabulous spread that's found at every corner of the restaurant. Good point to note is to request for complimentary parking if you are parking your vehicle in the hotel.If you are not a big eater, have it as hi tea, and don't take the dinner or you will have indigestion and difficulty in going to sleep at night.
4
Very good food overall but it feels very public with the restaurant situated on a corner with huge windows. I felt quite exposed but that could be me! Award winning eatery which seemed hugely popular for dinner - you need to book.
5
An attractive array of international mix with Seafood in particular and a very comprehensive dessert station make this a very nice place for Buffet if one is to enjoy the variety of food in one dinner.
5
Foods were awesome and stuffs were super kind...a place to be to share special moments with ur love ones
5
Went for high tea session and the food are tasty!
Even local delights like chicken rice or laksa were served.
The stuffs were also attentive to our needs as we had a toddler dining with us.
5
Being buffet lovers we didn't want to miss eating. at this award winning restaurant and we were not disappointed.You get value for your money with the excellent spread and the good tasting food.
4
The breakfast buffet at the Carousel is awesome, there is a huge variety of options to choose from that cater for all tastes and dietary needs. Can get very busy, but the food is awesome. Also a good place to have lunch.
4
I had a high tea buffet on 24 Jun 16 with my 2 children. $48++ for adults and $32++ for children. 10% discount with quite a few credit cards (UOB, DBS etc). Chicken rice, laksa, pasta station, chocolate and rose fondue station, sushi, small selection of dim sum, satay, curries, kebab just to name a few.The waitresses were attentive and quick to remove used plates. The restaurant was not too crowded and it was a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon.They should increase the number of teas that they have available but as there was so much food, perhaps the diners were not so interested in drinking their cuppas.If you are looking for a "scones and clotted cream" sort of tea, this is not the place to go but if you have children with good appetites and you want to splurge a bit and let them have a good meal, this is a good restaurant to consider
4
You will love to know that the hotel offers free breakfast for hotel guests. It offers Asian cuisines, fruits, bread, pancakes, congee, coffee, juice, salad, noodles, etc. The breakfast buffet is open from 6:30am to 10am. Payment of walk-in guest is around SGD37.66 during my visit
3
Overall a wide choice and variety of food which was good, in the seafood section some lobster & crab were rubbery/chewy and disappointing; however oysters, prawns and mussels were excellent. Wide choice of salads and cold meats and fish. Most 'hot' food was only warm including carvery and spicy/ curry dishes; no facility for warming up food? No cheese selection as there was little cheese left. Choice of desserts and puddings was satisfactory. Wine was served promptly and glasses topped up when empty. Waiters very attentive, courteous and cleared the table quickly. The payment experience with the waiter refusing to give the 10% credit card discount on the total bill because the card presented for payment was not one of the 4 named was unacceptable but this was resolved later by the restaurant manager after registering a complaint with hotel reception. Overall the buffet price is too high and if you stay in the hotel a special meal price should be offered to paying guests. Breakfast was satisfactory with both quality and choice of food and the package price of 30 Singapore dollars for 2 persons offers excellent value for money but it is important to ask for this deal at check in
4
we were there for a birthday treat. the birthday person received a small slice of cake from the hotel which was a really nice gesture. the food selection was excellent, even with seafood. the chilli crab was a hot favourite and everyone was queuing up for it. it gets a little too crowded during the weekend, which is obvious why (because the food is great!)
5
Simply amazing so much delicious food to choose from, just make sure you save enough room for the desserts!!
Staff were great and happy to help with everything.
4
Be it to meet friends, family or colleagues, this a good place to go to for a decent meal at an affordable price. Plus, their desserts are to die for!
5
Been here time and again. Had Iftar here with the lovely wife and enjoyed it thoroughly, as always.
Fresh seafood, great sashimi and Asian stuff. And if yes....wonderful desserts. Pricey but it's worth it!
5
I have been patronising Carousel ever since I was a young girl. I have fond memories of this place, and I am pleased to say that Carousel still does a great job. Amazing food spread and service staff.
5
The food selection in Carousel is amazing compared to the other buffets in Singapore, but what's special is the service. I'm constantly amazed at how I've never had to frantically wave at the staff to clear the empty plates. If I could change one thing, it'd be the cheese selection. It's already good by Singapore standards, but I'd love a wider selection (this is me being completely greedy). That said, I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best Halal buffet. Actually no, I think it's the best buffet in Singapore period.
5
We were there for our 7th Wedding Anniversary. We have been there a couple of times and we must say that it has been a super good dining experience! The Ramadhan spread was awesome! We will definitely come back for more.We would also like to compliment all the staff for the prompt and excellent service
5
It was my boyfriend's birthday and I had previously notified Carousel staff. They planned everything really well and quietly sought me out during the dinner and ensured that my boyfriend was nowhere near me when they informed me of the time of the birthday surprise. I thought that this was very meticulous and Carousel really ensured to make his birthday dinner a magical one

I had lunch buffet for a colleague's birthday. I informed Carousel during the online reservation and they kindly presented a cake with candle and chocolate birthday label (I omitted the singing as my colleague would be embarrassed). It was very thoughtful of Carousel to do this. The staff (a sweet lady) offered to take photos for us and it was a memorable experience. My favourite dishes: crayfish, scallops, chicken rice, laksa, desserts. Sushi was unique and ice-cream flavours were different from the norm. Sashimi, dim sum and fruits were limited in variety though. More Asian (local, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Thai) than western (roast chicken and lamb, salad).Looks like it is a popular place to go for birthday celebrations as there were 4 other birthday lunches held too (I didn't know that - it was my first time). Looking forward to my next visit

went here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and it was definitely a good experience. dropped by earlier to leave my present there and staff offerred to handover the oresent to my boyfriend along with the complimentaru cake. food was definitely wonderful - from the seafood to deserts and everything else.
4
seafood abounds many buffet set ups but here at Carousel you could taste the freshness of the sea bounty. it is like eating very freshly catch crustaceans yet it is not fishy in taste, it does not leave an unpalatable feeling. the reception is fine and the service is fast. you have to try the cheese section because it is there that i have tasted a cheese with apricot, perfect with their fresh bread.in fact try everything and thank me later.to see and taste is to believe
5
Wonderful place. The staff are friendly and attentive. A pleasant experience. Thank u for the excellent service. Will surely go again next time.”

I ate breakfast here twice during my visit. There is an amazing amount of selections to choose from...western, Indian, Chinese and more. The fruit is delicious--fresh and ripe.
I enjoyed trying different foods that I was not familiar with, and particularly enjoyed the Indian selections.
5
Good food and pleasant atmosphere. Staff were friendly and prepared a small anniversary cake for us. We really enjoyed the evening there. 😄😄😄
4
Good variety of food and most of all seafood, we did enjoy our dinner but its so hard to get a service. Their live station for pasta were average, cozy ambiance and all the service and kitchen staff sing & dance for the birthday celebrant. Worth the value for money
5
The pictures of this buffet does not do it justice if you are in the area it is a must to visit the food is plentiful and very very nice you are not rushed and can take your time the variety of food is amazing and good value for mone

Went to this place to celebrate a birthday. As we were led into the restaurant it was a bit of a surprise to see that it was a buffet style of place but we were led to a private room where the staff looked after us very well. The food range was enormous as well as excellent. Would definitely go back
5
I am not a buffet person but this place totally rocks. Reasonably good food & range, plus a group of wait staff with a consistently high standard of service have made this a very holistic dining experience. Well done! I have even recommended your restaurant on Facebook. :
5
I always have Carousel in kind for Birhdays. We went there thrice already to dine together for my husbands and 2 son's birthday. Never disappointed. A very wide spread of food choices. Nice ambience. I highly recommend this place be it with family or with friends
5
Carousel @ Royal Plaza on Scott will always be my favourite hunting place for me to book for the special one celebration. Every year twice or triple will make my trip there. The food taste awesome. Yesterday went again with my best friend for her birthday celebration. Booking by the name "Zaleha". Thanks to the staff who make my friend surprise with their performance for those who celebrate birthday in JUN.
5
An amazing spread of international dishes from limited sashimi, sushi, freshly boiled crustaceans and scallops, fresh oysters, Indian dishes, western ox tail (lovely), lovely breads and loads of other food. The quality of the food was above average but the dessert was outstanding..too much to try everything. Chocolate and Strawberry fountains! Wow!
5
Love their buffet spread and warm welcome from the staffs. Thanks for the birthday song and cake for my mum on her special day. She is very happy and surprise!
4
Went with friends for lunch on Friday. Can get crowded quickly as they serve buffet lunch for exactly 2 hours (12:00-2:00pm). Huge choice of seafood as well as meat and chicken and vegetarian. You will be spoiled for choice...can be overwhelming!
5
The seafood was excellent and that was just the start. No wonder that this restaurant has been awarded greatly throughout the years. Highly recommended.
4
We had the high tea on weekend with family. The food and services were good with wide selection but the prices were too expensive. Overall, this is a great place for special occasions.
3
Good selection of foods however, nothing outstanding considering the price. Not much different from Cosmo in London.
4
Lots of hype over the Carousel Buffet and when I actually tried it, nothing that special compared to other restaurants in the area. Certainly not a cheap place to eat for dinner.
5
Excellently located on busy Scotts Road this fomerly known Cafe Vienna outlet had proven to be the most popular eating place in Orchard Road vicinity.The food items served are so varied and lavish from continental to local delights and has attracted the lical elite and socialites to dine here. It gets very crowded on weekends and public holidays and reservation is advisable to avoid disappointment in getting seats here
4
Had breakfast here while staying at the hotel. The variety of food choices was so different to anything we had seen before. There was halal food which we tried, as well as the standard fayre. The coffee was very good, they also had barista coffee machines so you could help yourself as well.The staff were quick and friendly and all areas were clean
5
I have always enjoyed dining in Carousel ever since, my late mom brought me for a lunch buffet in the mid 90s, for a family get-together. The atmosphere is always warm and welcoming. Plus as it is a halal eatery, bringing relatives from Malaysia have been easy. Thanks to my late mom, now I am bringing my son to enjoy the place just as how I've enjoyed it. A mini dinner cum birthday celebration for my wife with our son in Carousel was indeed memorable because my growing up do include Carousel. Thank You!❤
3
For a buffet, the food is pretty decent. I heard a lot about the seafood and it didn't disappoint. However, I just felt that it was overpriced. The desserts were supposed to be good, but they were average. Service was good, though. Waiters were really quick in topping up water and clearing up food
3
Good spread especially sashimi as there are salmon, salmon belly (upon request) & etc. Desserts are satisfying too with the very nice chocolate ice cream. Herbal soup with prawns is 1 of my favourites too but oyster is only thing missing.
5
Great buffet and great staffs. Celebrate my husband birthday and gave him a surprised with a slice cake. Staffs are friendly. We will come back again.
5
We only sampled the breakfast buffet, this was excellent value, 6.30 till 10.00 am, good variety of fruit pastries and cooked items.
5
Quite pricy, but worth a visit, Lots of choice. Waiters very attentive. Lots of fresh seafood. Cheaper to visit mid week.
4
great international food, their range is really wide... though the price is abit steep, probably due to its awards... otherwise service is great, great atmosphere, conveniently located. would come back for special occasion
4
Stayed a night at Royal Plaza and next day breakfast was at Corousal . As usual they are very good with varieties they offer during breakfast. Foods are fresh and lots of selection. I like the fruits selection. Notched down because some of the fried foods were too oily but you do have other options. Helpful staffs and cleanliness are what make them worth high rating too.Keep it up. Hope to go here again soon. Recommended
5
Carousel never fails me whenever I come. The food is always amazing and the selection is extensive.Most impprtantly, the service is very good (polite and clear your plates quickly), and it's Halal for our Muslim friends.At $80++ a pop, it's definitely not cheap but worth everu dollar you spent.So, enjoy and eat your hearts out!! ;

This buffet has quite a wide variety of cuisines and is very popular in Singapore for celebrations and gatherings with muslim colleagues as it is one of the best rated halal buffets in Singapore. You need reservations, especially for weekend. If you make a group booking, they actually send you a credit card form to fill via email. If inadequate notice is given for fewer than guaranteed number of guests, they will charge for the total number of guests in the booking (ie. if you book for 10 and show up with 8) without notice, then you may just be charged for the 10 persons booked for. I have made reservations for many eateries in Singapore and abroad, this is the first place which makes the booking process quite so onerous. there's also a difference for charges with weekday and weekend prices, so it's good to be aware. Personally I don't think anyone can eat enough to justify $101 (weekend adult price with taxes) charge. So I will not be going to this eatery again
3
Went for dinner here based on Tripadvisor.com's reviews but was slightly disappointed. Reservation could be made online which was very convenient.Other than various kinds of seafood which were very tasty and fresh, the other food were really nothing special. Selection of sashimi was rather limited but oysters were very fresh. However, out of 3 kinds of oysters from different countries, 2 kinds were completely gone by 8:30 p.m. After finishing the appetizer, I wanted to try the quail but it was completely gone by only 7:30 p.m. The chili crab wasn't spicy at all even though I couldn't eat spicy food and the chef only started cooking on site another wok of crabs when the food was all gone. So besides this process being slow, the taste couldn't quite be absorbed into the crabs. The atmosphere of the buffet was rather jolly and service was very good. MAS was very helpful and had good initiative to serve. He provided us with a pair of scissors when he saw us very clumsy cutting up the crab legs. Most shocked was the bill when we were being charged weekend prices for a Friday dinner. Initially we just read the prices at the top of the page showing difference between weekday and weekend. However, after being charged weekend prices on a Friday, I rechecked the website and found at the bottom of the page Friday is being treated as weekend. This made me feel the buffet even more over-priced
5
We came here for our last night dinner in Singapore. Great food. We came on a Friday and there was unlimited seafood, lobster, crab, oysters sashimi! Everything is delicious and fresh! Dessert was amazing! Staff are really great also. They allow one bottle of byo which is a nice touch.
4
Basically, it is halal food. Too many choices to choose from until you cannot eat it all. Would be good if you can be there for hours to savour the food and not waste the money that you pay for. :-)
5
Staff are wonderful and nothing is too much trouble, food was plentiful and amazing, this breakfast can keep you going all day
5
Had an awesome high tea buffet. Very good spread of halal asian food. Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and Japanese food. Very nice desserts too. Service was commendable. Parking is complimentary too. Everyone must try! Highly recommended!
5
Spoilt for choice. Can't decide what to start with. Great place
For gathering. It is hahal certified. Great food n great company
5
Fabulous food and excellent quality. Service staff is attentive. The variety is so wide that you'll be spoilt for choice! My favorite in Singapore, always a must visit place.
5
My friend and I went to have dinner at Royal Plaza of Scott. Staff there were friendly, amazing and very enthusiastic. On top of that the food there was amazing and top class. The dinner was such a memorable one when a group of 15 staffs sang the birthday song for my friend. They definitely went above and beyond to give an excellent and astonishing experience. A guaranteed place to be recommended to my other friends and relatives. Keep it up
5
This is one of those meals you will return home to UK and tell everyone for years to come about how crazy the extensive dishes were available at the buffet ranging from Indian, Japanese, western UK, Chinese and Italian with each dishes prepared at exquisite level of the quality.The price is a bit steep at $76 plus service and tax to around $100 in total per person but at that price in London you will only get maybe one lobster with one starter and dessert with coffee in a moderate restaurant while here you can get mountains of lobsters, fresh mussels, fish, sushi, local dishes, French duck dishes and Englsih roast dishes all at one price. Service is really good, attentive but not intrusive which put most restaurants in UK to shame who charge 10% service rate as standard. They really need to see the staff in action here to learn the difference
5
I last went to Carousel a few years back. I was already impressed the first time i went there. I decided to revisit the restaurant again with my partner recently. The friendliness of the staffs, the amazing buffet spread, the quality of food (esp the cold seafood selection), the whole dining experience WOW-ed me and my partner. We did not want to leave the place
5
Been here a couple of times and the spread never fails to delight every members of my party. Absolutely love the cold seafood spread, as well as the whole cooked salmon, so so so fresh! The dessert station is always a pleasant finish to our meal. Looking forward to my next visit
4
We made reservations for 3:30 pm high tea. A queue had formed in the lobby when we arrived at 3:25 pm. We joined the queue and was led to our table promptly shortly after the restaurant re-open for high tea. Service was good, very attentive waiters and waitresses who cleared used plates and replenished cleaning water and serviettes promptly. Loud music when some one celebrated his/her birthday.Lots of variety. Our favourite are the chilli crab (always snapped up when served), fried carrot cake (a bit salty sometimes) and swiss roll (real soft). Ice Kachang, Pandan Leaf Chicken, Bread Pudding and Prawn & Mussels salad are equally nice. Udon was a tad too peppery for me. Didn't have the stomach to try all.Drinking cup is a little small. Went several rounds to refill water
4
Just like their name, you will go around thd wholeplace to taste each and every item they have to offer. Taste wise, just so so, there are better buffets out there for a lesser price, dont quite get it why the place gets packed.
4
The food and services are prefect... I will come back for dinner served. My son was happy and he enjoy the cake and food too... especially the dessert.
5
My boyfriend and i celebrated our first anniversary here and i'm proud to say the place dinner didn't disappoint me at all. There were a huge varieties of cuisine to choose from. From starters to mains to desserts. I would love to dine in again. Thanks for the warm welcome & the complementary cake
4
Huge variety from Seafood, Western, Italian, Japanese, Chinese to Indian. Love the sushi but the sashimi slice was unconventional and thick, not my liking. Desert and Indian section was nice and interesting. Food was overall delicious and fresh. Lunch buffet is limited to 12-2pm. Would be nice if its 3 hours instead
5
My fiance and I went to celebrate his birthday recently, and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Oysters are not my favourite kind of seafood, but what the Canadian oysters they had there were literally sweet! Needless to say, we ended up going back to the seafood section for seconds. They have live stations that did really yummy cooked food too - the slow-roasted beef we had was tender and juicy. Their desserts bar had a wide array of items you wouldn't resist to try too. They are known for their bread and butter pudding, but we loved their chocolates and macarons too. I appreciated that their staff were most polite no matter how busy the place was, and they were thoughtful to call me up a day prior to my reservation to ask if I wanted a surprise for my fiance. And they did a cute song and dance number, coupled with a complimentary cake to celebrate the occasion! Despite the relatively higher pricing, we loved our experience there
4
We cannot deny that this is one of the best restaurant in town. I saw diners queuing to get seats in the restaurant. The good point is that it is Halal and therefore indispensable for many Muslim tourists. The range of foodstuffs offered is also reasonable
5
Went for lunch on a Saturday. What the venue lacked in ambiance was made up for in the freshness and quality of the food. A wide selection of sushi, sashimi, seafood, various hot food stations and excellent desserts (find Asian desserts generally unappetising but there was a great variety and all excellent). Very friendly service
5
This is probably my more than 5th time here and this restaurant has never failed to disappoint me. Last night, I have made my visit there again with the intention to celebrate my dating anniversary. So I have requested them to surprise my boyfriend with a cake that says "happy anniversary". And they did an amazing job and took a picture of us with together in which at their personalised effort, they have emailed us the picture they took with their iPad. Big A on effort to connect with their guests and for being the only restaurant that makes guests feel at home with their high quality service. Thank you Carousel for making the celebration an enjoyable and memorable one
5
been to few buffet here in sg,but carousel is one of the best.The place was really organised, each station got good choice of variety of food.Perfect for any celebration,events,etc.i love every food being serveda must to visit again..Service was great too..from the hostess to the server. The surprise for birthday celebration was really an effort that even chef hav to dance.My girlfriend and i was really satisfied...thumbs u
4
Good selection, a lot to choose from here. I think the desert section is the highlight. Excellent service, although we hadn't booked they made sure we got a table and looked after us.Look out for the Salvador Dali sculpture in the lobby!Not the best buffet but worth a visit
4
One of the best buffet spreads in Singapore.
Great value for money.
Halal label makes it ideal for everyone.
Mouth watering desserts and drink selection.
4
We have stayed numerous time at Royal Plaza at Scotts and one of the highlights have always been the buffet breakfast at the Carousel.
5
We've been here with my husband last March...All i can say is the service, the buffet..everything is excellent! Will definitely recommend my friends as well to come here when they visit Singapore.. :)
3
Booked this place based on reviews on tripadvisor, had booked 2 months in advance so didn't expect to be sitting almost in the hotel reception so everyone walking into the hotel almost bumped into us, food was average at best & not much selection, came away very dissapointed & £100 lighte
5
Friday night buffet. All you can eat lobster, clams, oysters, scallops, crab legs, sushi and sushi fish, Prime rib,and an great selection of prepared dishes as well as desserts.Friendly an efficient staff. It appeared most people only had water. Nice discount for paying with a credit card.Lamb Osso Bucca was a stand out. Very reasonable for the selection. A great dining experience
3
Little wonder why there is almost always a queue to be seated just before the restaurant opens for high-tea on Saturdays.It is likely one of the more reasonably priced buffets in town. The spread offered is also considered generous, ranging from salads, cold cuts, sashimi to seafood and chicken rice. Kids would generally love the dessert corner where they can enjoy putting together their very own ice-kacang or skewer a marshmallow for the chocolate and strawberry fondue coatings. Free flow of hot beverages, cold wheat grass drink and soursop drink are inclusive in the spread. To make it even more appealing to a wider clientele, the kitchen is halal certified.Seating is generally sufficiently spaced out. However, every high-tea seating is highly packed. So, walk about cautiously with your food in hand.This is easily accessible by bus. It is located opposite of Far East Plaza, next to the American Club. Nearest MRT station would be the Orchard MRT Station (10-15 min walk).I would recommend this as a casual place for group gatherings amongst friends and family
2
I had breakfast at 7:30am on a weekday, which is supposed to be a busy time for hotel breakfasts. However, food was terrible and old - noodles were all dried up and stuck together, fried egg was shriveled around the edges, Indian bread was oozing grease (not like the fresh bread served in other neighborhood hotels), fishcakes in noodle soup smelled bad, fruits tasted of spicy food (probably staff mixed cutlery when cutting fruit), and overall quality of food was really really low. No fresh fruit juice, only three blocks of mass produced cheese as “cheese board” selection, and even coffee was bad. It’s obvious the hotel tried to cut costs by using inferior ingredients. There are other, much better breakfast buffet places nearby Orchard Road. Not worth $32 (++ tax)
4
have been dined here for a few times. the most recent one was for my birthday. we like particularly the cold seafood section and dessert section. The lobsters and prawns are really fresh. and the caramel custard is definitely to die for. not to forget to mention the funny birthday dance they presented. thank you very much
4
Went for buffet dinner with friends. This place is usually crowded. Try to go early to avoid queue for each station. Lots of choices including japanese, local& chinese...food replenished immediately once finish. I love their dessert. So many to choose frm!!!very appetising. staffs are attentive as well. Great for the price paid.recommended
4
What a great assortment of food, from sushi to duck. Everything was fresh and tasty. The desserts were even amazing. My only complaint was the noise and crowds, and if you weren't paying attention. you could get trampled by hungry diners darting in and out of the different food areas.
5
I've been here for the fifth time. And no words to describe on how much i love the food and the atmosphere. It's just fantastic and to all the staff at Carousel 'You guys are Excellent'....
4
The service staffs is friendly. An excellent and big spread of food choice.
The birthday surprise set up from the service staff was unexpected one. Thank you for the arrangement!
4
Very good food. Though need to add more items in each section. Some of bit expensive items are taken off the menu every alternative day and it needs to be stopped. Good customer service by staff.
4
Had one meal here and found good clean atmosphere and yes, good food too.
Service was very satisfactory .
This is an excellent spot to have an informal business lunch and close some deals .
Recommend the place to one and all.
4
Cheaper to do during hi tea buffet, buffet style quite a variety but serve with wide variety of food selection; the deco is nice, but need to be early as it can be crowded;
5
I mean twice I've been here its a dinner paid by my bosses. But I mean the 70++ for this buffet is worth it. They have everything, from carving- Lamb and Beef, to the freshest Fish dishes. They have all types of seafood you can imagine- Oyster, Lobsters, Prawns, Crabs. Its all in here. And the sashimi- its incredible. :) fresh salsmon sashimi and tuna. They also have some sushi. There's more, the Ice cream, you can literally scoop how many you want, a dream land for us girls right- though I'm so not gaga about because I'm lactose intolerant- but hell the Chocolate Ice cream is goooooood. They have a cheese bar as well with breads. I mean what more can you ask for. A haven for foodies out there. A must try in Singapore. It is always packed with people by the way and Its HALAL but it doesn't matter. You wouldn't missed the pork if you see all the good food here. Keep up the good work Carousel Team
5
WOW that is my first impression of the place n their top notch service. Amazing spreads of fresh seafood. Impressive service from waiters to chefs. Foods are made in small batches, to retain their freshness and replenished once finished. Wide variety of food selections and dainty desserts, to spoilt your taste buds, and at the same to give nothing more than a satisfying tummy
5
My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Carousel for dinner with our two best friends. We arrived early, despite the buffet is still close, the staff welcomed us, sat us and served us the wine we've ordered. The buffet was amaaaaazzziiiing! I mean, I am not exaggerating it, IN OUR OPINION, they deserve a good review and the spot they're at in tripadvisor. The variety of food, the portioning and the taste are beyond decent. We all felt we gained 10kg after that sumptuous dinner. The staff are really courteous, prompt and are always smiling, they even gave us a "happy anniversary" cake :) They played a happy birthday song over the restaurant's sound system and all the staff sang along with it and they've given cakes to the birthday tables. My husband and I and our two best friends also work in the same industry for the past 9 years, we also work in a 5 star hotel here in Singapore, we know if staffs and chefs are being trained properly in customer service & customer recovery. With what they've shown while we were dining in, they've gone beyond a mile with almost everything. The courtesy of the staff and the ammmmaaazzzing food will definitely make us comeback. To the management, keep it up, we hope you could maintain the kind of service you've been imparting to your staff, it really reflects on the aura of the restaurant =)Kuddos Carousel Family!Keep it up
3
One word of caution, being a veggie I struggled to get a decent Indian food when I visited this place for business dinner. The place has good options for deserts and my colleagues admitted the local food and the seafood is excellent. My review is based on the vegetarian options available for me and its quality
5
I'm not a person who loves buffet but here i would like to share my experiences in the services provided. I was celebrating my wedding anniversary with my wife there. I love the services as every time i finish my plate and leave my seat for a new plate of food, the previous plate remove form the table before i get into my seat. It happened numerous times and i was amazed and delighted with the prompt service. I do requested for a cake prior to the reservation, however the executive replying in my email politely return my email by giving me an alternative as they do not serve what i previously requested for. Then during the buffet itself, without requesting for the cake, one of the staff approaches the table where i'm seated and send me the cake. It was fantastic as they knew where i am seated and they didn't forget about the special request that i seek from them. Overall good service from the management team and the staff on the floor. Kudos'
5
The buffet was fantastic. There are a lot of variety of food and the quality is above average. For the price I would say it's just about worth it, as compared to some overpriced ones in Singapore.
3
It was absolutely ok food in the Buffet ! The price is little too high as compared to the variety of spread we had.... for vegetarians there is hardly any option......desserts was good.....over all, I would not recommend
4
Food is good(or normal ) but good customer service. Everyone is smiling and kind.
They makes ppl feel comfortable. Yogurt is delicious!
5
The food at carousel is awesome!service is even more great when each service staff you see gives you a smile. I love the pasta live station and the dessert spread.... is wonderful. Fresh oysters- amazing. Japanese spread -speechless..
Will definitely come here again!
5
Good variety of choice of fresh hot piping food always in supplied and the desert is something not to be missed!
5
Great night with my friends. Food was good, service was tip-top. No regrets, for sure will come back.
4
I had Carousel Buffet during lunch, the spread is ok. Happened to be my mum's birthday, they gave a cake and sang birthday song. My mum is touched, thanks for the sweet surprise. But for lunch, there is no oysters and the cake selection is not alot.Overall, I think those who did not go before. Should have go at least once
4
I have been to this buffet restaurant quite often and the service is excellent. However if you are going for dinner make sure you go early as on a few occasions we went an hour before closing you may find that some of the dishes are finished and not replaced. However if you go relatively early the selection is great especially the seafood section where everything is fresh sometimes you will find oysters from more than three countries ach with a unique taste. The hot meals there is a large selection of western, Asian and local choices. Overall a great place to go to and no wonder its continually voted as the number 1 buffet restaurant in Singapore
4
We specifically choose this restaurant during our reunion dinner. Buffet spread is good, more varieties and seafoods are totally fresh. Just that the dining area are too crowded and very noisy. Even the staff themselves do not understand each other. However, one chef made the difference he's very attentive and funny. Wasn't able to get his name though.We'll be back agai
3
We 3 boys had Dinner on Sunday 20Mar. I had high expectations, after reading great reviews.1. As we enter the Hotel Royal Plaza, this restaurant is to the left, open glass to the street. Not good.2. The décor is like a budget café.3. There are 9 stations, Seafood, Japanese, European, Italian, Carvery, Indian, Asian, Hotpot, Desserts4. The Japanese and the Seafood was fresh. You could order a customized Pasta Dish.5. The Indian nan was freshly made but none of the curries were a standout.6. Desserts were not being supervised as kids were touching most of them and not being topped up.Service was just average.Compared to Shangri-la and Mandarin at HK and Sydney, Nothing to WOW - for the $90 per person
3
Not a very fantastic tasting buffet spread. The taste was so-so over all and the cakes and pastries unremarkable. Best was perhaps the sashimi section. This is not a buffet I'd like to have a second time.
4
good varity of choice of fresh hot piping food always in supplied snd the desert is something not to be miss.
3
Many cakes variety. Buffer spread is average. Overall, it's a good choice if you love desserts... 😉
4
The food items seems to be a continuation from the lunch. It is very heavy for a high tea and you feel rushed eating it all in 3 hours. However, it is halal and the service very prompt. I recommend you go for dinner.
5
A very good customer service and staff and also very professional in handling events (My Husband Birthday Party). Won't regret it!!!!
5
Carousel high tea has always been famous in Singapore. We went there today for high tea and were more satisfied with the spread. If you want value for money. Please go to Carousel. Remember to make your reservation early. It is always fully booked.The best part of the buffet us the staff. Mega is a smiling princess. No matter how busy she was, there is always a beautiful smile on her. She and her team made the our trip a very memorable one. If anyone is looking for Mega, she is the smiling princess in the picture. Good job Mega and staff! Royal Plaza on Scotts should be proud of you. Keep up the excellent service
4
It's not always easy when I take my extended family out for a meal because there are family members who won't eat anything from the Western menu and members who love sashimi and oysters, and children who look for familiar comfort food & desserts. So Carousel is the place that always has something to cater to the most conservative & fussy eaters. Food is always fresh and at the temperature they're supposed to be at. Staff is attentive and friendly. We always have a good time when we dine there!
5
First class international buffet.Very good spread of food and very fresh sea food. Great variety, halal food.Presentation is good, selection is huge. Best to go there on an empty stomach to enjoy the huge selection but keep enough room for their desserts and cakes which are really delicious. It would take a couple of visits at least to try them all...provided you get invited as the buffet is quite expensive. Probably among the top 10 buffets in Singapore
2
We ate breakfast here 4 times in March. The staff were friendly and attentive however the buffet is a pork free zone. Meaning the kids couldn't have their bacon and eggs treat, and I couldn't have my steamed pork rib or BBQ pork bun. The waffles were the worst I had ever tasted, pre-made and stored in the refrigerator before serving. Just awful.I saw the apprentice chef serve a burnt omelette to a customer, and mine wasn't much better.The upside was the Indian style which tasted good, fruit, and pastry selection. Overall disappointing, spending all that money on breakfast and as we walked out the door the kids just wanted to go down the road and order a bacon and egg mcmuffin at McDonald's.We will not eat here again
5
Carousel Buffet at Royal Plaza on Scotts never fail to capture me! The wide variety of food, the spread that is offered right from local food to Japanese sashimi to desserts, always entice me. Good venue for get together, for company events, for birthday gathering.Their staff service are always tip top! Greeting you by names - polite and always on the ball
5
The food was very fresh .... Especially sea food.... TOP 10 buffet in Singapore . Located at Orchard road.... Easy to find the location.... Come try
5
I just love the buffet at Carousel. They have a wide range of foods, and most of them tastes good. The food here is Halal.
4
Buffet dinner was a spread . Many variety of food. Staff was attentive and attend to you fast . A complimentary birthday cake was presented and staff was singing and dancing birthday song.. had a great time.
4
Always heard from frens that Carousel buffets is nice so give it a try. The food is fresh but I find the cold crab is salty.. Nice deserts and crowded this evening...
5
Always think of Carousel whenever i want to celebrate special occasions. The food spread is amazing, you'll be spoiled for choices. The fresh cold seafood are my favourites. The dessert especially the bread pudding, a must try.

I have been visiting Carousel for most part of my growing up years. It has one of the best variety for buffets and the food is always fresh, especially the sashimi and oysters. However with the increasing prices (and same spread), it's now $86++ per adult for weekend dinner, and I'm not sure whether I'd come back soon as there are other hotel buffets which are equally good with more promotions. Nonetheless this is a halal restaurant and it's the best you can get if you want to go for a buffet with a Muslim friend. :

I have been here on two occasions and had overwhelming experiences on both the occasions. The sushi and sea food section were good, but nothing beats the western section and the desserts. I was so full that I couldnt even taste all the desserts.A bit pricey though, but what the heck; excellent choice of lunch when you are not paying
3
We have heard a lot about it and it's one of the most popular buffets in town. Location and spread is considered good. However it is really average and just caters to popular taste. Nothing extraordinary and very crowded. Lots of desserts to fill the belly.
4
Spoilt for choice on the wide range of seafood and plenty of meat to choose from. But too crowded with tight seating arrangement that might not be comfortable enough. Nevertheless the ambience are great and staff are very attentive and deligent. Advisable to prebook your place for your dinner date. Jut that price for the buffet are indeed steep
5
After hearing so many great reviews over past years I finally experienced the buffet for myself. The selection was endless, the service was excellent in fact beyond what I had expected. There was a wedding somewhat the day we visited but the staff were never to busy to assist us. Definately Worth the price tag!
5
Yes, all the reviews are correct; this is surely the best, most economic buffet in Singapore; be prepared for great food and incredible choices.
5
Bit overpriced but a plenty of choices. You are bound to find out the dish of your choice. Try if you are staying there.
4
Went for lunch with sisters to celebrate younger sister's birthday..Price abit expensive but they do great excellent service n food totally fantastic. .do make a reservation for lunch on weekend and dinner to avoid disappointment
5
The experience was lovely and the staff and chefs were so friendly that it felt like dining at home with friends/family. The spread of food is wide and sumptuous. I especially loved the dessert bar!
Definitely a place to go back to.
4
Breakfast Buffet was included in our Flash Promotion stay from 30th Jan. Very good selection from a variety of both Asian and Western dishes, deserts, pastries and juices. Staff were attentive to our needs.
5
Will keep coming back. The service, the buffet..everything is excellent! Will definitely recommend my foreign friends to come here when they visit Singapore. :)
2
Food at high tea very orientated towards the local Malay community. Salad bar not fresh. Bit of a canteen like atmosphere. Very noisy as no soft furnishings to absorb the chatter. Desserts not great and chocolate fountain was not good quality chocolate more like chocolate sauce
5
I had a great experience dining here & please make a reservation in advance, dinner gets really crowded in here. Request for a change of table as we are not that comfortable to where we were seated, our request were furfilled immediately with the help of this gentleman malay staff. Plates has been cleared immediately as well.Amazing choices of dishes, nice ambience & great staff! At the end of my dinner, they gave a complimentary cake with a "Happy Anniversary"on it. Thank you so much for making my trip a memorable one.Definitely would be back. Cheers

Hotel breakfast is the same. Always the same thing every morning. We opted to eat outside instead. sure the coffee was nice but the breakfast was just dull.Dinner is a whole different story altogether. Although quite steep, I recommend booking in advance as it gets very busy. Dinner was simply awesome. Good variety. Great taste for everyone's taste buds.All in all, NO NO for breakfast but YES YES for dinner
4
 ~This review is based on breakfast~Pros:(1) Located just steps inside of the Royal Plaza on Scotts(2) A good variety of breakfast food featuring different cuisines (Indian, Asian, Western)(3) Omelets prepared on demand(4) Tons of seating(5) Several separate stations featuring fruit, breads, pastries, chocolate fountain and juice barCons:(1) Cost (~$27 USD for breakfast
5
We had a great dinner at Carousel. One of the most affordable buffet in town. I loved their fresh oyster bar and the array of local food. Perfect for family gathering. Will definitely come back!
5
International buffet restaurant that serves sumptuous food and good service. Was there to celebrate my husband's birthday, surprised piece of cake brought to our table and birthday song were sung aloud. Best of all it is a halal certified kitchen restaurant. Thumbs up.
5
The spread was complete with the most delectable sweet endings! They have a unique polaroid souvenir photo for your birthday. Will definitely come back here.
4
My favourite section are the Japanese, and Seafood section. The salmon sashimi, and crustaceans are fresh and delicious. On top of that, their desserts very satisfying and appealing. Too bad there was a time restriction for lunch to be served until 2pm. Otherwise, we would have swept the serving trays clean. It was a pleasant experience for us
5
It was a fantastic birthday celebration for me and my family. Service was great, seats were very comfortable and food selection was awesome~! Totally spoilt for choice! Seafood was fresh and tasty! Thanks to Carousel Team for the Birthday cakes and Birthday song~! It was indeed a pleasant dining experience
2
I have been to a number of buffets and I am still perplexed at how this place has been ranked the best buffet or even the rave reviews from this site. Decided to give the place a visit for lunch after reading all the reviews here but will not step in again there. Felt sick after eating there.Pro:Service staff is good.Cons:Most of the stations seemed emptySeafood spread is not as shown in pictures, just a few crabs and did not look fresh nor well prepared.It gets crowded for lunch, so have to wait for sometime at a few stations.Food does not get re-stock as fast a possible.Overall, did not enjoy the experience there
4
At Carousel Buffet, when you "see" the "food", make sure you have enough space in you to make it worth while.They have a fantastic selection of different dishes not to mention the seafood. Freshly shucked oysters were amazing. It was difficult to find the faults - the service was great, the food was delicious. Definitely worth the money and will be back again. In fact, I have been back again. :
5
It is really the best. I try a lot of buffet. Even was Buffet club member last year, but here is really great. Wide choice, really fresh. it is pity, that I didnt make any photoWill do next time. They even have private rooms for party - thinking about my birthday part
5
This is one of the best buffets I have been for as it has a great variety be it Japanese, Chinese, Indian or Continental offerings. The Sushi was fresh and the Indian food was simply wonderful. I would say that this is definitely value for money
5
Initially, we thought the buffet price was quite high until we actually dined in ...... it was really, really worth the price!!! The chilled seafood spread was awesome. Kudos also to the pastry chefs -- loved the pastry selection. Awesome food, awesome staff ..... what more can one ask for? Carousel is truly deserving of its wonderful reviews
5
Dinner is a ensational choice of delicious food with staff who really want you to have the best night out. Thoroughly recommend.
4
Was told this is the best buffet in Singapore for seafood and we were very happy with our choices. Lots of hot options and the desserts were great - awesome creme brulee and chocolate fountain.
4
I love the level of excellent service by the staff. Attention to detail, eagerness to help and polite and smiling.
Will come back again.
5
Had dinner buffet for two. Excellent service by the waiters. They are very attentive and look out for customers' need. The buffet spread is excellent especially the seafood station and also the pasta station. Will definitely come back!!!
4
A wide variety to choose from but its the seafood section that appeals.Crab Legs, Oysters, Salmon, Prawns, Clams Sashimi, Sushi....To die fro desserts, spoilt for choice or for people like me took every single desert to try and ended up with a sugar high..Still loving the " Birthday Dance Performance" they perform upon request.Top it all off, the service crew were a bunch of fun and enthusiastic bunch of people which made the experience a breeze especially when Carousel can get a little bit noisy and crowded
5
Me and my family were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were were surprised by the staff's initiative in arranging a nice slice of cake for my wife, including a birthday song. I didn't expect it to be so persona and I will definitely be returning here, whether I have a special occasion to celebrate or not.The buffet spread was amazing and wide as well. Thumbs up to the team
5
Variety of food from cold seafood to hot dishes. However, need to always call beforehand to check whether they have oysters. Sometimes it is inconsistent. I have been to carousell for personal and business meetings for both lunch & dinner timings and sometimes they serve, sometimes they don't.Staffs were attentive. Place could be abit noisy sometimes. The desserts are really good. More choices compared to other places I have been to.Price wise is acceptable. Need to always make advance booking
5
Carousel at Royal Plaza on Scotts is a very much recomended Halal certified Intl Restaurant that serves a very wide varieties of Intl Buffet. Ranging from Asian, Japanese to Mediteranean cuisines. From sweets to savouries and too many to be listed. One thing fore sure the ambience is very good, located on the hall of the Hotel, and the greatest point is value for every single sollar spent and the price so so very reasonable. Go and ezperiebce it for yourself
3
Looked online for reviews about this place before making a reservation. Most of the reviews are rather good. But....if you are looking to celebrate a special day, I wouldn't suggest this place.1) This place has no ambience at all. It is located at level 1 of the hotel. Seats are so close to one another. It was so noisy and crowded even on a weekday. To be honest, the variety of food was quite limited. Good thing the seafood is rather fresh. 2) This hotel has no valet service too. So if you're driving, you got to find your own parking lot.3) Pricing wise, it is about the same or just slightly cheaper than The Line at Shangri-La. So this place is not worth my money spent. It'll be fine if you just want a normal dinner buffet with friends or family. Couples....forget it
5
Love the variety of cuisines offered at this restaurant. The buffet dinner i had with my family was an awesome one, and the staff even sang a happy birthday song for me as it was my birthday! Very friendly courteous staff who looks out to satisfy and help whenever required. Love this place
4
Love their reasonably priced buffet with a relatively good spread of food. Salmon sashimi was fresh and aplenty. Dessert selection was good as well. Would come back again!
4
A very expensive buffet . Huge variety of food to choose from. One of the most popular buffet restaurant in singapore. Must make a reservation before going.
4
Make sure you book, even house guests can have an issue to get a table for dinner in particular. Quality is good and the variation of food is also quite good.
5
We was looking for exceptional restaurant for our anniversary, it was the right place and best choice, everything was perfect, it was memorable night, very recommended
3
Although it's nothing special, but everything is done properly. Food is good, services are good and somehow better that most class withing its range
5
Suitable for muslim guests (halal certified). wide range of foods, it will be slight expensive during seasonal festive like chinese new year, hari raya and christmas. one of the best halal buffet in Singapore.
4
For the price tag that comes along the buffet, the spread is decent. Staff also called ahead to confirm if the booking was for any special occasion. Slices of birthday cakes were then given to those celebrating at the buffet.However, fruit juices cost extra and are not part of the buffet, so be careful when ordering drinks through the waiter. Always check if it is part of the buffet price
4
We enjoyed the buffet spread, the staff were all very amicable. We have always loved the food and ambience at Royal Plaza on Scotts as a whole and Carousel has always been the place to have special get togethers.Highly recommended, they will even sing for your birthday and take pictures for your company which they will send to your email.
4
Great service staff! Our plates were promptly cleared and our glasses were almost always filled with water. You'll never get bored with the wide selection of seafood, dishes and desserts (ooo~ the chocolate lava pudding). I especially liked it that the restaurant made sure that the food items were constantly replenished. I do agree that the standard of the food has fallen significantly compared to the last time we dined here (maybe 3 years ago?). Further, we were there on a Saturday night and probably a Saturday thing.. there were a whole lot of overly excited patrons who will do anything and everything to get ahead of you in the line to lay their hands on the food. Be brave and you'll be fine. Also, remember to let the restaurant know in advance if you're celebrating a birthday, the restaurant will kindly throw in a slice of cake and a birthday song for the birthday girl/boy
5
When we stay at Royal plaza on scotts, we get free breakfast buffet at carousel buffet. They have many variant of food for breakfast. You can choose which one you like for breakfast either Singaporean food, dimsum, or western food also. The taste is quite delicious. Now I see thats why they get the reward for the best buffet restaurant in Singapore for 5 consecutives years
4
We had dine-in few times and never get bored with the menu and service. We love the seafood buffet as well as the desserts....It is the best place for anniversaries and birthdays..
5
We had the breakfast buffet and have no complaints. Wide variety of food - Western, Indian, Chinese, not much Malay. Food was delicious, staff was pleasant and service was great.
5
Carousel has long been my favourite restaurant in Singapore. The food is awesome, wide variety & high quality. Even the birthday celebration was cute. All their staffs are very courteous and helpful. Such a great experience again!
5
One of the best buffet in town and they served halal food,great variety with great service & staff even though sometimes is very packed and wait to be seated
5
First time at Carousel restaurant, and it was such a good experience! Special thanks to Chef Robert for chatting with me and giving me such a great plate of pasta!
4
We were invited by a friend to meet for high tea and found it an amazing spread. Food was fresh and varied in tastes so all our preferences were catered for - Japanese, local favourites, western fare, Thai ..... Great surroundings too.
2
Me and hubby is frequent diner at carousel either for lunch or dinner. Sad to say we both hav the same thinking is the food standard dropping. I will tell u why we had the thinking. Today made a booking for lunch. From the first station (seafood -lobster) me n hubby went to take our food we discover something not right......when I flip the lobsters most of the lobsters meat was bluish n I had to flip about 5-6 of them to find a lobster with white meat.....manage to get one n seeing the Colour of the meat hubby decided not to take......I shared the lobster that I took with hubby......the meat was so hard n rubbery. We end up just taking one piece of each seafood n hav a bite n leave the balance as the taste was not fresh like how we hav taste it before.......From the Indian section, the papadam was not crispy n I literally had to tear the papadam.....not sure how long ago the papadam was fried n it did not taste fresh.....also the gravies did not taste fresh......I m a Indian food lover n know very well how Indian food taste when it is cook fresh n the food today was not fresh......the western side (the line after the soup counter) most of the food was about potato.....potato "theme" food ???......when i was looking around what to take the Chef place a newly fried fish with some sauce on it.......was so happy to see freshly fried fish but to my disappointment I had to "struggle" to cut the fish n when I take a bite once reaching at my table, it was so hard......from what I notice is the fish was fried before hand n when the fish dish finish from the counter, the standby fish was fried again n "dress up" with sauce......I m frequent fish eater n I know how normally fresh fried fish taste like n the texture......at the meat section, nothing look appetising n end up ordering the pasta......the Chef cook it within minutes n thumbs up for for efficiency but the pasta was hard to bite......both me n hubby Juz had bites of the food n did not enjoyed our lunch.......that's the first part of it.......now comes the second part.......at about 4pm plus hubby started to hav stomach discomfort n vomited twice n we had to rush to the clinic and doctor diagnose him with food poisoning n the bill came to $130. Being a frequent diner I am really disappointed with today's lunch which also resulted in my hubby getting food poisoning. This also shows staff in-charge of the food is not doing proper checks on the freshness of the food. It's the quality of the food that pulls the diners to keep coming to dine but if the quality is down the drain, it's gonna push the number of diners u gonna have
5
It was our first time to dine in Carousel in Royal Plaza on Scotts. Both me and my wife work in the hotel industry here in Singapore. I am not surprised why Carousel has won Best Buffet Restaurant for 6 consecutive times. The variety of food is excellent. It caters to almost all diners. The place has a good ambience. Staff are always on their toes and are very pleasant. We enjoyed spending our Anniversary and will definitely recommend and be back next time. Congratulations and hope you keep up your good work
5
We had a wonderful nite at Carousel even though initially our booking was given up due to we came late(partly our fault too). But the management team did a great job by finding us a new place for us to enjoy the nite. The spread there as usual was abundance. Always looking forward for the alaskan crab and the signature bread pudding. Kudos to Carousel and the amazing team on 20/1/2016
2
Greed is what this hotel buffet is all about. Patrons simply hover and hoard the seafood and meat areas allowing little pickings for the rest. Staff is pleasant enough and seem to work as hard as they can to top up...but its a feeding frenzy. Won't be back anytime soon. Food less than average...not sure what all the fuss is about
5
Not too expensive or cheap... you will have a good time enjoying your luxurious food.. nice ambience too.
3
I have nothing bad to say about the buffet, which is EXTREMELY unusual for me. The only problem is the number of choices vs. the available time and acceptable calories. It's also in a relatively small format, which speeds meal-shopping.
5
I enjoyed dinner here as a solo traveller, food and service were both very good. I made a reservation and this was a good idea.
5
Extremely high standard of cuisine, coupled with great restaurant atmosphere. A word of praise must go to all the staffs who made us feel welcome and served us attentively throughout the night.
5
My family and I came here to celebrate my uncle's birthday. I'd been here many years before prior to this visit, and was pleased to note that the standard of the food and service here has not dropped. My favourite and a must-try at this place: the seafood and the desserts (especially the creme brûlées and fondant).
5
Celebrating hubby's birthday. It was a wonderful lunch buffet spread, we were spoilt for choice. Hubby was so happy to see an array of seafood especially the oysters... Definitely will come again for special occasions. And we applaude the Carousel staff for taking their time to celebrate with us by singing a birthday song and presenting the birthday boy with the cake. He was so taken aback by it. Super duper happy. Thumbs up carousel
5
... And all very delicious. We went for a company lunch. They have all the bases covered -- salads, appetisers, seafood, mains, noodles, desserts... And now I'm hungry just remembering the spread.The seafood was very fresh when we went, and the cooked food felt as if they went out minutes after the chef finished preparing them.My only quibble was not having enough tummy space to try out everything
5
On Tuesday, when I first tried to book online a table for 5 on our intended double birthday celebration night which was a Saturday night, I found that the restaurant was fully booked. Reluctant to change our plans, I wrote an email to appeal for a table. I was overjoyed to receive a phone call from Carousel the next morning accomodating my request. Noting it was for a birthday celebration, Carousel made special arrangements for us too! At 8pm while we were there, a beautiful and uplifting birthday song was played. My son and I who were celebrating our birthdays was each presented with a slice of birthday cake with a lighted candle on it. A member of the staff then took pictures of us with an ipad/tablet and the pics were later sent to us via email. In addition, all the service staff at the restaurant were so attentive to our needs. Even when I asked for the bill, I felt the service provided was awesome. What else can I say! The night was made so special and I truly recommend Carousel for helping to ensure it was.
5
The choices of foods was great and the supply never end. I like the fact that been International buffet, you must have most of the choices of each individual cuisine. As this restaurant cater to Muslim, it can attrach more customer which I personally feel that it is a good move. Although they dont serve pork, but i don't see it as a problem
4
The food is good and fresh. The spread is marvelous. The service is prompt and great. Things are not very well labeled and the price is a little steep as compared to Green house. There is too little ice cream variety. Sashimi is a little disappointing, the cut is poor and the presentation is poor. Can only say that it is good but not excellent
5
Best and freshest seafood possible, great variety of international and Asian dishes and all with a friendly smile. They have it all: sushi, Chinese, Mediterranean, salad, tapas, seafood, ice cream, chocolate fountain and tons of deserts.
5
Truly warm and hospitable. Off course not forgetting the wide variety and excellent food. Well done and keep it up !
5
Must try! go see for yourself :) the service and food was excellent - without a doubt one of my best experiences.
5
Decided to have dinner at Carousel tonight but not sure if it was fully booked. They were accommodating enough but the 3 of us had to share a small table so it was quite crammed. I enquired if we could move to a different seating, unfortunately it was not to be. The staff serving us (sorry can't remember his name) - a young malay chap with coloured hair and pierced ears ( still looked presentable mind you :) , went out of his way to keep checking if we could move our seats and eventually we could. He was always attentive, efficient and professional. This is the kind of service that leaves an impression on your customers. I will be a repeat customer for sure
4
Carousel remains to be one of the best buffet restaurants in Singapore. The spread includes Japanese, Asian, Mediterranean and Western fare as well as an amazing range of fresh seafood and delectable desserts. However, the price of the weekend buffet dinner is quite expensive and my suggestion is to go for the buffer lunch or the weekday buffet instead.
2
The buffet at Royal Plaza was truly disappointing. We were offered a small round table with high chairs as they were fully booked the night of 23 December. It was very uncomfortable to dodge between cutlery, crockery and food on this small table. We were promised to be moved once a larger table became available, but were not. A 4seater table however, remained unoccupied throughout dinner!!!The food was not anything great that we had heard about. Most of the food was cold!! Even the desserts were nothing 'to write home about'. Very disappointing! I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
My wife love this dinner anniversary occassion that we just had at this Carousel restaurant.Having said that I truly agree with her on the overall food being served and lovely good attitude working staffs. In short, Excellence food and excellence customer service. Warmest Regards...MZ and wife
5
An excellent restr. where from beginning to end, the service staff makes one feel at home and welcome. Even if you are slightly delayed and ed later, they smile and accommodate us without making you feel : pls leave now ! They have an excellent gust recognition system where the service staff are able to recognise guests and repeat visitors by name. Truly warm and hospitable.Off course not forgetting the wide variety and excellent food. Carousel is truly the place to host any event, from a twosome to a large function.Well done and keep it up 
5
Definitely the best restaurant in Singapore. Here you can find all the food varieties of world. All kind of sea food are available in very well cooked. Nice environment for couples and families and i would recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to see and try what real buffet means
5
Celebratin' the New Year at Carousel. I had the pleasure of meetin' resident chef Robert Mak, a jolly fellow and he made me his famous signature dish - Lobster Risotto! Highly recommended! The risotto was delicately cooked with generous portion of lobster meat mixed together with cheese and hints of truffles. Love it ❤️ and had it all by myself
3
The buffet spread are ok but the food were cold. Hot dishes should be on burner all the time. Japanese and cold dishes excellent.
5
This restaurant deserves the title of "the best buffet restaurant in town"
So book ahead so you will get the chance to experience their wide range of food from starters to desserts
3
Carousel is always crowded cos it is a halal buffet restaurant. Although wide variety of food, the food are just average. Nothing fantastic.
5
I have gone through the main restaurant of Royal Plaza on Scotts since olden times when it was called Cafe Vienna. And it has indeed maintained itself as one of the best , if not the best halal restaurant in Singapore over >20 years.
2
Crowded, crowded, and crowded. Food took ages to replenish. Quality average. Long queue just to enter the restaurant.
Not worth it.
1
Voted Best Buffet Restaurant in Singapore for 6 years running, this was such a letdown when my friends and I visited Carousel for a birthday celebration on Monday. We were initially amazed by the wide variety of food offered but ultimately very disappointed at the quality of food. We started with the Asian food. The laksa tasted almost the same as what we had in primary school. I was looking forward to trying the Tim Sum Station, but what was left was only the salted egg pau with a really rough pau skin and substandard fillings. The seafood did not taste fresh, some crab legs were slightly watery and tasted fishy. The Atlantic Salmon looked massive, but do not be deceived by the appearance, because the texture was shockingly as hard as a chicken breast meat. The lobsters and scallops were decent, though nothing fantastic. Clams and mussels were generally too salty that we started worrying about our health if we continued to consume them. Moving on to the Japanese station, I was relieved that at least the cold noodles tasted normal. It tasted somewhat familiar to what I had purchased from the supermarket. The dessert station was one that left us speechless. They were pleasing to look at so the three of us decided to share each of the cakes but they were so awful that we couldn't finish most of them. The cakes were unbelievably awful, some tasted too sour while some (such as the bread pudding, chocolate lava) tasted like we'd have diabetes. My friend even had to spit out the food because the combination of the ingredients were just too quirky. The only redeeming point, I'd say, was the chocolate fondue and fruits. We were very excited to visit Royal Plaza on Scotts after reading the many positive reviews online about the buffet. However, after having tried the food, Carousel is unfortunately most definitely undeserving of the title "Best Buffet Restaurant".
5
One of the reasons why I love to stay at Royal Plaza on Scotts was their buffet breakfast at the Carousel restaurant. The Carousel has won many awards and voted as the best buffet restaurant in Singapore for 6 years running. I travel solo many times to Singapore and always enjoyed my morning breakfast here. The Carousel has their own house-made bread and desserts on display every morning. Not only that, they also provides international halal cuisines on daily basis to suit people from different culture.Like any good hotel breakfast there is plenty on offer from dim sum, fresh fruit juices, croissants, fresh seafood and fruits. Kids' favourite usually the omelette station where they can request different vegetables and meats to be put together in their omelette.The unfortunate thing about being a solo traveler was that there are too many things to try and only so little space in my tummy. Next time I should drag the whole family to eat here
5
Fresh seafood with a variety of shellfish and a to-die-for sweet vinegar sauce, and succulent salmon that's delectable on its own. The pasta was delightfully al dente and the Chef made a dash to find me some olives (thank you!) cos I was in that sort of mood but it was not on the buffet. The deserts, yum!! The chocolate fountain was rich and creamy, and the fruit was fresh, bountiful and delicious! Will definitely go back to tuck into the chubby ribs, the Indian kebabs, and sumptuous looking European meats and potato spread. And they gave me a finger bowl - oh so dainty! Fab service, from the time you walk in till you exit. Oh, and they taxi valet rushed to get me a cab off the street - now how's that for 360 service! Thank you! What a lovely first Sunday welcome to usher in 2016. I have eaten at much more expensive places, but the friendly, well trained, and politely attentive staff, and food freshness here,wins hands down

We had our office year end lunch at Carousel on 31 December 2015. Carousel offers a wide selection of food. It has Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Indian and French stations, etc. Seafood on ice is fresh. A good range of desserts, cakes, pastry and different types of cheese are served. There is an even an expresso machine where you may make your favourite coffee, latte and hot chocolate. Lunch is served from 12.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m. It would be good if the lunch hours could be extended for half an hour more. Overall, I enjoyed the lunch except that due to the time constraint, I could not try their creme brulee. My colleague commented that it was good. What a pity to have missed it
5
This is a excellent place for buffet. They have wide variety of food you can choose from. The best thing about is that you can take as much oysters you wish! Because there isn't a person standing there and questioning you how many do you want!! The dessert variety is vvvvvvv good! Plenty of cakes and pastry for you to choose from Everything here is good, I love their seafood variety too
5
Love coming here. Awesome food, nice ambiance. Splendid desserts! Good seafood too and local delicacies. Please try when you visit Singapore.
5
Carousel, our regular dine-in Halal buffet restaurant. Celebrating our wedding anniversary on the brand new year 2016. As usual the food was great with numerous varieties to choose from especially the seafood station which was one of my favourite. Also Carousel staffs are friendly and attentive to our needs. Keep up the good work and service. Thumb Up
5
Take a seat, take a deep breath and pace yourself. Don't fill the plate at each station - moderation is the key if you want to savour all of the delicacies on offer here. The Japanese section is impressive and so is the seafood. So many options but make sure you leave room for dessert - a chocolate fountain put a smile on my face. So did the chocolate sprinkles ;
4
I went there last week with my wife and a few other friends, we went there for the lunch buffet. A wonderful experience, many choices of food starting from sashimi, seafood, steaks, and even indian food. The dessert was fantastic, you can never have enough of them. Personally I feel that the dinner menu is better, but if you want to save some money, lunch is not a bad choice as well. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a nice buffet meal
5
The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet spreads at carousel are massive! The food and desserts are delectable...so very scrumptious. Depending on the theme, there could be roasted lamb, chicken rice, chilli crab, Indian cuisine, sushi and other Japanese cuisine, Italian cuisine, a whole lot of fresh and precooked seafood. Don't forget about dessert! There's a variety of cakes, ice cream, frozen yogurt, bread pudding, chocolate mousse, fruits. They're all so yummy! The cost per adult for lunch & dinner is not very cheap mind you. But it's worth it
3
Always call before going but reservations were full. So had made reservation this time round for the dinner. Has high expectations as theres always high ratings for the buffet.For myself.go for quantity and not quality. Not a dish has won my heart. Still think I will spent more to go for The Line at Shangri La

For Christmas I wanted to take my family to the BEST buffet in town. The Carousel at Royal Plaza on Scotts was highly recommended even winning lots of awards. I did all my research online & felt so assured reading all the food reviews. Surely they are very credible. I made my Appointment for 6pax a month in advance. I had informed them that it was also my in law & fiance birthdays. The staff was kind enough to call me keeping me up-to-date that my booking was confirmed. When we got there & was assign to our seats (by the lady in pink with short hair). We were honestly given the WORST table in the ENTIRE restaurant. Mind you, we were also celebrating my future in law & bf fiance as well. I wanted them to have a good time. We were seated right next to the area where all the dirty plates were taken to. The worst part is the flooring was so slippery the chair kept sliding. My in law slip off her chair and hurt her back on her birthday celebration!! Everyone turned to us and stared some even laughed. How embarrassing. She could have injured her back. I request that we move to another table. We got a better table but my in law barely ate cuz she hurt her back. She is 55. You can only imagine the pain. The food selection is amazing but the staff at the teppanyanki station was really lazy. He wouldnt cook me a fresh batch of chicken. He was just chatting away to the guy in the sushi section. How rude. The salmon sashimi slices were cut too big. Also disappointing. The best part was honestly the desserts corner. I loved it so much including my entire family. I loved the fresh oysters! The person serving us was nice & very lovey. Not to mention the meat station too! I'm not sure if i would go back again. Maybe if we got better seats and was treated better by the chef in the teppanyaki station. I had a good time ... but it could have been more amazing

We went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my birthday. The staff came up with slices of birthday cake for each customer whose birthday falls on that same day! They clapped and sang birthday song for us , took photograph and sent a copy to us via email! Really made my day! The food was great with a wide variety. I don't say it's cheap but its value for money
3
I was there with my colleagues for our Christmas dinner, 11 of us.Given the price per person for the dinner, I will think the food variety well deserves the money we had spent.The bad point about Carousel is, there wasn't any crowd control mechanism. There were 2 tables ( probably also a Christmas dinner gathering among colleagues) but it turned a little too rowdy and none of the staff stepped in to control the situation. It made us wonder is this a restaurant or a hawker center.Prior to this first visit to Carousel, we had a casual dinner in The Line at Shangri-la Hotel but the situation was far more better. though the restaurant was full but it was a an enjoyable dining experience compared to Carousel.People said first impression counts, the impression of the 11 of us towards Carousel was 11 "thumbs-down"What a let down
1
Tried to get a table for hi tea but was told that its fully booked, even though we are guests staying in the hotel. The staff didnt even bother to ask if we'd like to wait or reserve a table. Is this how the hotel treats its guests
4
It's my third time having high tea buffet. It's worth the pocket and for the tummy. All is fresh and with a constant refill. You must have a reservation to get a seat and for convenience as well.
5
FRESH FRESH FRESH !! Fine dining except sometimes there could be noisy tables talking loudly.. Deserts are amazing and Eat till your Tummy explodes !
5
It's been ages since I last visited and dine at the fame Carousel Restaurant at Royal Plaza on Scott. Today's Christmas Lunch buffet spread was awesome.Freshness of the seafood like Crayfish, Mussel, Scallop, Prawns, Sashimi and Salmon is beyond words. For a halal certified restaurant, the management definitely do not compromise of quality of food. The spread of food is very international and worth the price you pay for. I love their effort in making the diners comfortable and prompt service staff is a super plus point. I love you the food and the quality and awesome service. You won't be disappointed
5
I have been ordering traditional and Asian styled turkeys with macaroons and log cakes for a very long time.It has become somewhat of a tradition these days with the family.I have come to appreciate the staff, whom I count as my friends, who greet me each year without fail. Thank you guys! I appreciate the effort taken by the team and kitchen staff who have done wonders in adding to the spirit of Christmas for my family and I.By the way, the turkeys and cakes are delicious and simply out of the world 
4
The variety of options for breakfast were excellent. They catered for every nationality and taste. The staff were friendly and attentive. The only problem I had is that the food was not hot enough. It was luke warm. That may be caused by the lids on the bain maries were left open.
4
The buffet spread was rather decent, had quite a wide variety. Food were not bad too especially the fresh seafood. Good for a group of friends to gather and have a meal together though talking is a concern with the crowd. Book in advance to avoid disappointment
3
I went to carousel buffet dinner on a weekday and a weekend. There was a stark difference in both days.Firstly, the selection for oysters on a weekend was more than on a weekday. Also, the oysters were not as fresh on a weekday.There were also more selection of food and its quality was better on a weekend
4
Simply put - a Great Buffet. Extensive selection of dishes, styles and foods. Bubbling ambience, buzzing with eager diners.Perfect place for a group of hungry, discerning eaters. Very classy and worth the money paid.Tip - book well in advance. It's rightly well patronised !Highly recommended
5
We have gone to this buffet a number of times over the last few years, and mostly recently yesterday. It is still one of the best buffets in town in terms of variety, quantity and quality of the food. Buffet food often tends to disappoint because it often lacks the freshness and flavour of food ordered ala carte, but not here. Perhaps the secret is in having small food stations manned by staff who prepare everything freshly as the groaning board empties - from raw oysters, and a wide array of seafood, to local favorites like chicken rice or noodles, Indian, Mediterranean, Japanese (including sashimi and sushi), Chinese, Italian (including a dedicated made to order pasta station), roast beef, roast turkey/chicken and trimmings, and salad and appetizer bar. There is also an amazing variety of desserts from ice cream and a chocolate fountain to Christmas pudding, assorted cakes, stollen, bread pudding, mousses, homemade chocolates, creme brûlée, etc. You also help yourself to assorted tea and coffee. The high standard of this buffet is evidenced by the full house crowd every time we have been there. So it is better to book in advance to ensure you get the date and time you want. The only drawback is ending up eating much more than you should because the food is so tempting and delicious. This is also one of the few halal buffets in town, which makes it particularly popular when halal food is required.

Spending around 80 SGD/ adult and you have a chance to indulge into a wonderful buffet dinner. The most interesting thing for me was the seafood counter, which included a lot of fresh oysters and others. The staff were amazingly friendly. On the day I were there, I saw a lovely celebration dance presented by the restaurant's staff. Hope I have chance to be in Carousel in my birthday or my friends' so that we can have a joyful time there, and a cute complimentary birthday cake as well
4
I was only able to enjoy breakfast here. It was always enjoyable with a great selection of food. If you don't see what you want just ask. The staff are always helpful and fun.
5
Nice place to eat 😊 they serve more variety of scrumptious food... 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 money wise its worth it... What arw you waiting for? Visit carousel buffet at royal plaza hotel
5
This is the best buffet HALAL food in Singapore that serves varieties selection of food from starter, main course to desert. Superb!!!.
5
Made my best friend's birthday memorable! Excellent service and a surprise birthday cake for her was commendable! :))

"To spend up to SGD 70++ on a dinner implies that you're going to have something that is apart from anything you could experience at a more modest price point. Is too the advantage for Muslims community as of the food served are "Halal" (in arabic meaning permissible). Food quality, perfect, fresh seafood, east and west cuisine. Tourist, Expatriate, local, I strongly recommend try and you know what I'm saying. Enjoy.
5
We held our event at Royal Plaza on Scotts. The attendee had a lunch at Carousel. Most of them were very satisfied. The kind of cuisine was much various, Singapore, Chinese, Indian, Japanese... In addition, this restaurant has Halal certification. Therefore, everyone can enjoy here except the people who enjoy drinking
5
Carousel Buffet is an elegant venue in the posh Royal Plaza Hotel. The buffet is of such a high standard with an amazing array of international food choices, especially seafood, that you need to book in advance. The best thing is that it is conveniently located on Scotts Rd just a few steps from Orchard Rd intersection. Great for that special treat
5
We were staying in the hotel for 3 nights over a long weekend so decided to try the Carousel. It was a delight to see but I have to say some of the locals who came in must have starved for a week, they were piling their plates high with lobster, mussels and fresh prawns. So that by the time anyone else went up it had gone. However, the staff did replenish quite regularly. We weren't particularly hungry so we're happy to just graze on everything. There were fresh oysters as well which once again were very popular. Alongside this was roast rib of beef and Yorkshire pudding and lots of different Asian dishes. A fabulous buffet! Also the desserts were extremely delicious. At weekend it costs near on â‚¬90 pp inc taxes, but well worth it for those with large appetites
3
This was somewhat disappointing, given the many rave reviews received.Variety was the missing element. The soups and appetisers on offer was just average in terms of quality and variety. The roast dishes were OK, but the one redeeming grace was the cold seafood...oysters, prawns, crayfish, lobsters and mussels. Even the desserts fell short of the buffets in 5-star hotels, so you have the impression overall, wondering what the buzz and fuss is all about
5
We think this is the best Sunday Brunch for the cost in Singapore. The selection cannot be bettered, certainly not at the cost. The seafood in particular is a wonderful and very fresh assortment. It has very friendly service. It is not too noisy. We took very fussy friends there and they were totally delighted, so it certainly passed their test as well..
3
The variety of food is great, but quality could be better. Overall, value for money, and a good halal option.
5
A pleasant surprise cake being presented to our table speacially for my parents wedding anniversary. Along with the wide range selection of buffet for high tea that is definitely value for money.
4
Sashimi and cold seafood are fresh, wide range of dessert, service is good. Will visit again for dinner buffet.
5
The hotel has a superb selection of food items from savoury to all sweets. A great spread of food items from the different ethnic groups in Singapore. A fine and awesome sweet treats for the very young and the seniors - ranging from the old school peranakan kueh-kueh to the rave of different chocolate fondue fountains. But of course my favourite still and has always been the age-old recipe of bread pudding and the lava cake. Superb end to the fantastic buffet spread
4
Excellent Service. Provides a special massive birthday celebration for the public. Call in to request. They play a birthday song and all the waiters will sing and stand in the designated area. They carry a slice of rainbow cake and offer it to the birthday people after the song.Seafood very salty. Good spread of food. A little pricey nonetheless
5
At $52++, I consider this buffet value for money. There was a wide spread of food, ranging from Japanese, seafood (cold), Indian, and Western. We had a hard time making a reservation though through the phone -- either the line was engaged or nobody would pick up the phone, and eventually, my wife had to go on site to confirm the reservation. But given the popularity of the place, perhaps its not surprising. The highlight of the buffet would be the Japanese sashimi and the 'cold' seafood. There were no oysters though, and the seafood was not really very fresh, but there was a wide variety, including clams, crabs and crayfish. Overall, for the price, I found the buffet to be value for money
4
Went few restaurants and realized Royal Plaza on Scotts buffet still most worth it and tasty. Lobsters and oysters are both me and my husband favourite. Both were big and fresh. Including the crabs. But the hot dishes varieties are slightly limited if I were to bring my mum there. As she can't take duck, beef and spicy food. There were not much choices for her
4
This is probably my 4th time visiting this restaurant over the past years and I must say that they have improved significantly.There is a good range and variety of food to suit your taste. The location is at the start of Orchard Road and it is conveniently accessible by MRT, taxi and bus. The Carpark is old though, hence my sports car has some difficulties as the width of the ramps and turns in the car parks are small. The price is very affordable though I would suggest that you call to make a reservation before coming to the restaurant. I like the salmon sashimi and those family with children will like the ice cream section. It is always very crowded as this restaurant is halal and there will be many Muslim friends and tourists found there too
4
Was brought here as a surprise on my birthday. Service staff is friendly and there is a large spread of food located at different areas in the restaurant to satisfy most if not all diners.They have a chocolate fondue fountain stocked with many different toppings, a big hit with the kids!At a pre-set time, the lights in the restaurant dimmed and the staff stood along the perimeter of the dinning area and sang a loud happy birthday song for all who were celebrating their birthdays in the restaurant, while a small cake with a candle was presented to our table.Overall all, a nice restaurant for the family with lots of food variety to choose from without burning a hole in your wallet
4
Because this is a halal certified restaurant, it becomes a natural choice when we dine with our Muslim friends.The variety is good but the quality and taste of the food is average.I would pick Asian Market Cafe (also Halal certified) over this restaurant. Of course, there is a price difference because if you pay peanuts..
4
Good buffet spread and it's a nice place to go with family and for birthdays. Birthday guests get a surprise from the staff there as well. The charge per pax is pricey though.
5
the dessert was the highlight of my meal! totally loved the local and international selection there :)
5
Recently my family had breakfast at Carousel. The variety was amazing, the food was fresh and service good, my son loved the waffles.
3
2nd visit to Carousel. First time was high-tea. Not much difference in terms of variety between the two. I would rather go for high-tea. Chawanmushi was out of sight at the Japanese station, although the menu on the website stated there would be chawanmushi. The Tomyum was too spicy even for a spicy food lover like me who can usually take very spicy food. The Tomyum wasn't very tasty as other restaurants' Tomyum that I've tried. The aglio olio made on the spot was tasteless. Previously for high tea, there was free flow of juice but not for lunch. I find that disappointing, considering the price. The salted egg chicken/fish from Chinese section just tasted like cream and salt with no salted egg taste, sadly. I usually love salted egg chicken. The dimsum section was good, the sashimi in the Japanese section were all fresh, even for tuna, so no fishy taste. Cold seafood area was okay. The cheeses were great, not too dry or hard. Guacamole was splendid but the refill of tortilla chips could be more prompt. The salad station had very good smoked duck and smoked salmon, pretty fresh and not too salty. The desserts were the best! *hats off* Creme Buleé, Pavlova and bread pudding were top notch, the chocolate mousse was good and the green tea yoghurt was really on point. Overall it was just a bit disappointing, as I thought it would be better than high tea. Not sure why the standard was inconsistent but the chances of me recommending the lunch buffet to others is highly unlikely.
4
My wife and I visited here for dinner on our honeymoon. The selection was fantastic, with food from all around the world and a large selection of sea food. We booked because of the reviews we had read online and were not disappointed. But be aware the meal does come with quite a high price tag
4
We enjoyed our time at Carousel Restaurant, but it wasn't really what we had expected. What we got was a great selection of food of all sorts, well presented but surrounded my a milling morasse of people, all scurrying hither and thither filling their plates. The tables resemble a store cafeteria rather than a plush restaurant. The lighting was harsh, but probably that was because of the style of the place. On the whole, we were a little bit disappointed with the place itself, but the food and the friendly staff made up for that. Well worth a visit, but probably not for a romantic anniversary celebration like we planned
5
Great food and service overall but as a seafood lover, the seafood was the highlight of my dinner! They have a wide selection, and the oysters are shucked on the spot which i have never seen before at other hotel buffets in Singapore. The freshness is guaranteed! Even towards the end of the dinner buffet time, the selection that was topped up remained at its best quality (i know because i didn't stop eating the seafood lol). Been here at least 5 times, and definitely will be back again
3
Maybe my standards are too high since I've been to a premier buffet (St. Regis) in Singapore, and I've been to a number of top buffets in Las Vegas. I found the food quality to be ok at best, and the selection compared to the TripAdvisor description of the buffet was misleading. Having 3 or 4 Halal & Indian options does not qualify the buffet to get a Halal classification.I was hoping for a buffet that represented the diverse cultures that make up Singapore, but instead we got a typical boring Western style buffet with a small acknowledgment of the cultures that make up Singapore. If you look at my other TripAdvisor reviews, you'll notice that I try to be positive in my reviews, but I can't help to be critical of this restaurant. That and a price of $90 SGD, it definitely wasn't worth it. I will say the attitude and effort made by the staff to make the experience enjoyable was top quality
5
Even before it became 'Carousel', Royal Plaza on Scott's, 'Café Vienna' was a go to place for me and my family to gather. IMHO, Carousel is the best place for halal food by a hotel. Must-trys include bread and butter pudding, the north Indian food selection, the sushi, and cold dishes. Dim Sum is great too. I had the.Best char siew chicken pay a few years ago. Can't find it during my recent visit though :(.Book early so that you won't be disappointed
5
The restaurant is good designedThier food tastes really good except for their dessert, everyone likes the dessert but I don't, don't know why, their green tea yogurt dessert is not good too as my wife doesn't like it too. The place is clean and the service is friendly and quick. There are a lot of different cuisines, it means you'll find your favorite and you can try new cuisines too. It is not easy to try everything in their open buffet as they have got a very big one. The place is located in a good area which it belongs originally to a hotel. They have a place for Muslim prayers too. Everything is good expect the green tea yogurt and their dessert
4
The Price Isn't the cheapest but you get what you pay for : huge buffet with everything you can imagine, made well, tastes amazing and is al
Of highest quality. They know what they're doing here! Best place to treat yourself
5
If you are looking for a lunch time Buffet then this hotel ticks all the boxes. Great selection of western and Asian food. Nice cheese selection and seafood.
5
Impressive selection of fresh seafood, huge variety of international food from Sashimi & Sushi to Laksa and Rojak.
5
We stayed at hotel and had lunch with family to celebrate son's birthday. Buffet spread was fantastic. Love the dessert selection, tasted almost everything! Staff were friendly and thoughtful. Infant chair and plastic plate/cup for my son were already set on table when we arrive :
5
I booked this as a treat for myself as I love seafood and read good reviews on this place.my wife and I went on a Tuesday and booked table for 6-45 thinking it wouldn't be too busy.We were shown to our table and told to help ourselves.I took a scout around to see what there was for my wife as she is not big on seafood but ok with lobster.There was chicken,duck,roast beef and Yorkshire pudding so she was sorted.I myself had a field day,started with some seafood soup then had half a dozen oysters which a guy had a full time job shucking.by this time it was starting to get busy so decided to have lobster and Alaskan king crab legs,these went down a treat so had another couple of helpings of crab and some New Zealand mussels to top it off.This was a fantastic spread and was restocked constantly with plates taken away quickly.The only downside is the beer was expensive and I think I was the only one drinking.the buffet cost 65 Singapore dollars but I think there was a service charge + taxes but I reckon I got my money's worth and had a wonderful meal
5
Nice setting for a great buffet, food is fresh and prepared in small portions so all the time you get freshly prepared food no matter if you arrive 6.30 pm or 8.30 pm Seafood selection is just fantastic. Staff very friendly and attentive, and took time to smile and pay a bit with our 2 year old daughter even when quite busy but proper organisation makes the difference and we felt that. 70 sgd++ for a buffet in singapore is fair pric
5
Endless array of food to choose from,hot and cold dishes, seafood galore (including crab, oyster, prawns , crayfish, salmon, scallops)Japanese galore, Indian, Italian, salad bar, meat carvery, 4 different areas of dessert, including hot and cold desserts, fresh fruit, ice cream , soft serve yogurt, 3 different chocolate fountains, tea and coffee, this is just a brief outline, seating starts at 6:30 and you can stay until 9:30pm, you definitely want to pace yourself, we had this on our final night in Singapore a great way to finish our trip A+
4
Buffet was awesome. So many choice and the quality is the best.but the price is on the high side. A lot of variety of food from Japanese to middle eastern.be sure to make a reservation as it is always full.They are one of the best variety of dessert so far
5
It was 2nd visit, this time was to taste the Dinner Buffet in conjjunction to celebrate my dear Michelle's Birthday together with my daughters. The first visit was for lunch and the ambience was superb despite the delicious menu. On top of everything, the actual reason that driven me to come the second time is the staff st Carousel. They are friendly and tidy. I love Carousel. I will be back again and again in near occasions
1
We went to the Carousel after reading the reviews on here, I wish we hadn't bothered. Prices vary depending on when you go, we went Sunday lunch and it cost 60 singapore dollars excluding tax (festive pricing) which I found was horrendously overpriced for what it was. I wouldn't be prepared to pay to this back home and I think because I read such positive reviews I then expected the food to reflect this. It didn't. I was most looking forward to the seafood bar and piled my plate up with prawns, mussels, crabs legs, clams and lobster. The prawns and lobsters were not enjoyable and had been over-boiled and had literally no taste. The mussels and clams were better. The sushi rice again was bland however the sashimi was good and did taste fresh. I had some curry (watery sauce....) and tried a fish dish which was average. To be honest the whole experience was very disappointing. My boyfriends dimsum did not look too appealing and looked to be mass produced and bought in. Very poor. I had a taste of a few of the desserts the crime brûlée was nice enough. The service was good however the food was over-cooked and overpriced. I squirm at how much we paid for such poor food - it was just a large selection of food done badly. I think this place is overhyped massively and I would not recommend it
5
Hands down this place serves fresh and amazing seafood. I am especially smitten with their whole Salmon fish! They have the friendliest crew too! Given, the good food, it's not surprising how difficult is it to do reservations on their place.
4
Love the seafood and desserts. Seafood tastes fresh. Desserts with a variety. taste rich and sinful.
5
My husband & i will never fail to have lunch/dinner at Carousel each year as it offers wide spread of variety from Mediterranean to local cuisine, from Japanese to Indian cuisine. We always love their dishes, be it seafood or otherwise. There are variety of dessert too. What is so special about Carousel is their service. Counter service always gave warm welcome. Dirty plates were removed almost immediately. And most important is they serve B-Day cakes if you are there to celebrate someone B-Day. Just one thing that can be improved: B-Day cake served could much better. B-day cake was not as good as the one on the buffet table. Hehe. But other than that, it is worth it.
5
as our office is near. , very often our company would organise for luncheon or dinner gatherings in Carousel. my countless visits with partner, family, friends and colleagues! wide variety of food and the quality has always been there. main highlight would be their choice of seafood.. love it! great service standards! this explains the reason to why they are voted the best restaurant in Singapore!
5
We had dinner with my family in this rather expensive buffet, but the price was well worth what we got in terms of both the food and the service. The restaurant is accessible near the Orchard road and MRT. It has a cozy and relaxing environment. The staff are extra-friendly. I'd give 5 stars only for the nice staff and servicing. The seafood part is great, but we also enjoyed the Asian and Mediterranean sections. Dessert was the best finishing touch. If you, your friend or a family member are lucky enough to have their birthday meal over there and they get informed about it, they'll throw a small party with the staff singing and dancing and give you birthday cake. Although none of us had a birthday, we enjoyed watching it for another table nevertheless. I'd certainly reserve a table for lunch or dinner (which you can do online through their website) on our next trip
3
The choose of food is simply staggering - all fresh and clean. However the "eat as much as you like concept" just encourages some of the worst excesses of behaviours with customers indulging n Roman orgy - style antics piling their lates with lobsters etc and returning for more 4 or 5 times ( I kid you not. !) Waste levels must be staggering.This is not a restaurant for ambience. More about gorging in a busy canteen environment with harsh overhead lighting and jostling for position in queues to stuff food. Oh..... and alcohol,prices are extortionate : no wonder most punters stuck to tap water - I am sure this was not just due to religious conventions !Overall : would not hesitate to recommend for food and efficient service but just know what you're letting yourself in for.... You takes your choices, you pays your price....
3
Saw so many reviews about this. So finally gave it a try last night. For about SGD82 (service charge and tax included), you enjoyed an wide array of buffet food choices. It was quite amazing that people were lining up before the buffet started. If you want a good wide offer of fresh seafood, this is the place. However, if you have any food allergies, this is probably not the best restaurant. The taste of everything else other than fresh seafood was average. Decor not there. The most impressive was the staff attitude and service. Worth trying once
5
Carousel never fail in their quality of food. Loved their ever fresh Sashimi and array of seafood. The Asian spread of Chinese, Indian dishes, the choice of western and Chinese soups...so yummy and wholesome. Not forgetting their yummy Bread Pudding with Vanilla sauce the best so far that we have eaten in Singapore.Carousel have something for all ages to indulge
5
My husband made a dinner reservation to celebrate our 19th Wedding Anniversary. We brought our son along to share the joy. The restaurant provides a very welcoming environment with good ambience. It serves wide variety of excellent foods and the service is brilliant. The three of us enjoyed our food so much that we were surprised to see that 2 hours had passed since we had first been seated. We were also very surprised when a staff came to our table with a small anniversary cake. She congratulated us, lit the candle on the cake and took our picture. It was such a delight. We would like to send our sincere compliments to you and your staff and look forward to dining with you again in the future
5
We came for a lunch celebration on the occasion of my friend's birthday. I had requested for a birthday cake at the point of making the booking and the staff remembered and followed through the request. Unlike other restaurants, all the serving staff came out to sing a birthday song for the birthday celebrants. A digital photo was also taken by one of the staff and it was sent to us via email within minutes.What really left an impression on me was how friendly and personable the staff were. We'll definitely be back
5
Everything here is wonderful, fresh and amazing. This hotel offers the best of everything all the time. It is a cool stop in a hot city.
5
Still one of the few completely and certified halal restaurants in Brunei.
Add to the huge selection of breakfast and dinner buffets, it's always packed.
Place to consider if you need halal food
5
The seafood at this buffet was so fresh and beautifully tasty 😋 the range of food was very extensive and staff were great. Included in price was house beer and wine too!
5
Its the best restaurant I have patronize. Good Food. Good Spread of choices. Good Service. Good Atmosphere.
Everything is just so gooooooood.
5
First note that one of the lead reviews suggests this restaurant is in Brunei. It isn't. It's in Singapore, although I am sure Brunei would be proud to have it's equivalent in sleection, quality and service.I wanted to focus my review on breakfast, although we hav a vey good (if pricy) dinner featuring seafood.The breakfast selection is mind-boggling, and all of it is good. My suggestion is that if you ae staying at the hotel (Royal Plaza on Scotts) you check if there is a special deal if you include the breakfast with your room reservation. We got a deal which made the buffet available to us for our daily breakfast for SGD 5 peer day. The chefs who cook the to-order eggs and omlettes are artists with a frying pan and visiting their workstation is highly recommended. Regional dishes share space with global favorites. I think you you would be hard-pressed not to have a great and memorable breakfast at the Carousel restaurant in the Royal Plaza on Scotts Hotel.Hope this review helped you
5
I had the occasion to dine here as a group (they have a separate group room). The buffet is massive! All kinds of Thai, Malay, Indian, Chinese, and local dishes. Extensive fresh seafood (crab, lobster, shrimp, fish) and lots of sushi/sashimi available. Incredible spread of desserts, breads and sweet treats, too! Too much to take in on just one visit. It is a bit price at $85 per person. Be sure to book a table in advance, as I went back on my own on a Thursday night and they were sold out even before the buffet opened at 6:30 pm
5
I had our breakfast during we stayed in Royal Plaza.they had almost everything from local, Western, chinese. I really fond of Their bread and butter pudding, it remind me of my mom's. Their high tea menu also plenty of choices and everything Deliciius. And for muslim traveleres this restaurant is halal. Love i
5
We were staying at the hotel and the Carousel and its staff are the true highlight. Breakfasts offer such a great range of choices and it is all so delicious that it is hard to choose. Do not miss the gooey bread pudding with vanilla sauce it is simply wicked. Couldn't resist it both days. Loved being able to have the best and freshest noodle soup but hubby loved all his more traditional western style breakfast treats. For our Anniversary they arranged a beautiful trio of their famous cup cakes with all the decorative trimmings served by their delightful staff. Thank you for looking after us so well.
5
Was in Singapore for a conference and had B'Fast and Lunch here .Amazing array of food and delicious too .Service is excellent .At B' fast they would make you a a spicy omelette if you desired or simply chose from the Hugh Buffett.Lunch would be so filling and tasty that it would get difficult to concentrate on the afternoon session of the conference .Overall a good experience for a Foodie 
5
Was there with colleagues, i am a vegetarian but i did manage to find myself some nice tasty food. But all of my carnivore friends enjoyed it with the various seafood and meat selection that was available. I managed to get tasty hummus and a bit of Indian cuisine. If you are a meat and sea food lover you should try this plac
4
Good Quality of food ...buffet hours seem a bit short ..should let customer had more time to relax and enjoy the food . It will be good if can extend to 3 hours ... dessert corner especially the cake section needs to be improve
5
The spread is insane! Especially the seafood section!
Service was excellent, with the crew constantly helping us to clear the plates and refilling our drinks!
The birthday celebration was much elaborated making my friend extra surprised and happy! Hahaha
5
Ambiance rarely gets better! Great lighting makes dining a genuine delight. Great variety of Desserts. Certainly one of the Top 3 Halal buffet choices in Singapore
4
Food are not bad, customer service is excellent. A good place if you want to give a birthday
surprise for your love ones.
Thanks Carousel! Definitely will spread your excellent service to my friends!
5
Wide spread of food. I love the fresh seafood & sushi. The food is delicious food. The desserts are great too, The whole place has a nice ambience. Staff are polite & friendly.
4
My first time here to celebrate a friend birthday. Wide range of food with a 5/5 tasting. Service is great and very prompt and location is convenient too!
Thanks Carousel@RoyalPlaza,
A great service with great food!
Definitely will return for more!

Well, I have had dinner at the Corousel many many times. With Management and staff, office gathering after a hard work. During company functions and so on. I brought my family of eight (8) for a nice dinner in celebration of my Birthday. The layout is perfect, the food is excellent, the service is very good. You get good quality of food for the money you paid for. So on the overall, I rated EXCELLENT for CAROUSEL

Carousel is a big buffet resto and could be very busy (as in overflowing) during weekends. Breakfast opens at 6:30am until 10am but extends during weekends to accommodate the inflow of guests (even non-hotel guests). There is a super wide selection of food (no pork) and drinks which are really tasty and good. The staff are very nice and offer good service, too. It was a pleasant surprise to find my fave bread pudding with cream sauce daily for the four mornings we were billeted at Royal Plaza on Scotts.You must try this famous hotel buffet when in SG
5
One of the best buffets in town featuring a wide range of international cuisines. Skip breakfast, eat your fill and more during lunch, and you'll find that you can skip dinner as well. My favourite is the tender beef slices which we can do sukiyaki on our own at the DIY station over at the Japanese cuisine corner. I always go for more than two helpings
5
This is one of the best spreads you will get. Seafood galore, and a variety of other nationalities dishes to whet the appetite. At here is plenty and dishes are replenished all the night. If you have a large group than try and book the private rooms on the side. Recommended.
4
The food is very nice, I like the oyster & very fresh. The variety is alot & customer services is very good too... will consider to come here again.
5
Worth it ! The seafood and sushi especially seafood section is my most visited . Recommended by my friend and tag along with my colleagues .
4
Cost approximately $150 for two pax. The food are good however small spread for the price paid & replenishing take quite some time. Sushi spread was fresh & staff clear the table & top up water efficiently.
4
Their service from every crew is good, the food is fresh,and very nice atmosphere. It's my first visit, and I will definitely go back again.
5
Serves local & international cuisine...
Many cooking stations to prep your food on the spot. Juices that's freshly made for you. Desserts & chocolate fondue... Bread pudding.. That's what carousel is famous for.
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday. Initially booked for 2, but last minute call them up to include my son, and I am glad that they happily add a seat for us. The food selection are wide, and delicious too. Worth to go another time.
4
My first visit was with a my colleagues for dinner. It was indeed quality foods, seafood, beef, lamb etc... but I never expect the High Tea to be as good. Keep up the good job. Will come back for more.
5
My family have been dinning in this restaurant many times since many years ago and we lost count. We love everything there, the seafood cold dishes and sashimi are very fresh and has wide variations, they provide a wide variation of cook food and the desserts are superb with free flow of tea & coffee. And very important for us, they are Halal certified by our Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. Yesterday we celebrated my husband's and eldest daughter's birthday and the staff organised a mass birthday celebration together with other dinners. It was lovely. Thank you Carousel. We will definitely return
5
The variety of seafood - both cooked and raw is certainly great for seafood lovers. I was pleasantly surprised by the choice of local food-- chicken rice, Indian curry, eastern and western soup and the wide spread of buffet dishes. You could sample hawker food as well...prawn noodle, etc. One visit make you yearn for more. In fact, I am recommending my friends to go there for our Nov/Dec birthday celebration
4
Came to Carousel 3 years ago for lunch. Today, the place looks cosy and great for catch-up with friends after reno.Went in a group of 5 pax with 2 birthdays among us. The celebration style was really a surprise to our table and in fact the whole restaurant! Very lively and charming!Food during dinner was plentiful, fast to refill and humongous variety. Cold seafood alone has lobster, mussels, clams, different styles of clams, flower crabs, Sri Lankan crabs, Alaskan crabs, juicy prawns, etc. Really have to refer to photos! We had a busy time eating and chatting through the buffet dinner. Will definitely return for next occasion/celebration!
5
Excellent serviced! I will visit soon agin. And maybe more on cool see food. Carousel buffet. And anyway the first time I try this buffet.
5
I had booked the dinner to celebrate my husband's bday. The buffet spread was wonderful... Many variety.. the seafood were very fresh... the dessert bar was excellent ... The staffs were all very friendly and helpful... it was a wonderful dining experience... Good Job
5
An unbelievable array of food on offer but my partner must of eaten three hundred dollars worth of seafood and you couldn't drag him away. great staff
5
Food, ambience, service and the staff there are wonderful! A great place to celebrate special occasion like birthday.
4
This is my second time here. I didn't have much impression for my first visit, but the second time, I kind of have a clearer impression of the place.First, wide range of food. Asian, western and a good range of desserts. You can choose from a huge space, so you won't worry about knocking into people with your hands full.Second, the food can be quite sweet. Even the main dishes. Not quite sure whether that is meant to prevent people from taking many helpings or not.The desserts are good, but very limited range of ice cream. I think there's only three standard flavours. A little sad.I must say the seafood is quite good. A few tables had plenty of seafood on them. I took some, but am more conscious of health.This is my wife's first time to the restaurant. She was a little disillusioned after this trip though
4
Had visited some years before, and this time had a visitor from Philippines to entertain. Promptly taken to the seat of our choice and the buffet was explained. Way too much choice, but brilliant never the less. Lots of people. Polite around the dishes so easy to select. Staff very pleasant and helpful. If you like seafood, the choices were amazing. I plumped for lobster, prawns, more prawns and salad. Come desert, even more choices. I think the trick is to eat steadily and enjoy everything.My visitor was well impressed
5
One of the best meals ive ever had. The food was fresh and full of flavour. Seafood was incredible esp the prawns. Service was professional and very quick. Dirty plates were gone as soon as u got up from ur table. Cant wait until i can go agai
5
This is by far the best buffet that i have ever had in my life.We made reservation and was late about an hour (tourist and travelled by MRT-so acceptable). The staff was so polite and found us a seat altho we were late. The food has been "ransacked" therefore we didnt get to enjoy the presentation. However, the taste was not compromised even abit. We weren't very hungry so we had a little of each dish. Every dish was awesome. The seafood was fresh and juicy. Just the lamb (under the light) was abit dried. Overall my rating for this buffet is 9.5/10. It is a must try when you are visiting singapore. Price wise is abit pricey (due to 3.2 exchange rate -MYR to SGD) but totally worth every penny. Not forgetting to mention - if you mention that it is someone's birthday, u will get a free slice of cake and also a birthday song and also a picture that Carousel will send to your email. Perfect.
5
The best place for Seafood Buffet. Really good food and a lot of choices. From oisters, crab, lobster etc. If you are a seafood lover this is the place to be. Also because it is very good & famous, you need to make a reservation beforehand
3
I booked this for the last night of our 2 week holiday for my boyfriend's 29th birthday as a surprise. As it was so highly rated on here I thought it must be something special...It was huge and crowded with tonnes of people grabbing huge overloaded plates full of food and taking whole trays back to their tables to go to waste. The seafood display was impressive, and the sushi was good. The rest of the food was pretty poor though to be honest. The curry station didn't have a very good selection and the meat on the grill station was a dry and not very tasty. The desert selection was very attractive, with 3 chocolate fountains of regular chocolate, green tea mate and rose. I enjoyed that part the most. They did acknowledge my request for a birthday cake for my boyfriend, and the waiter was sure to ensure he got a piece of cake as they sang a communal happy birthday to the whole room and all those who were celebrating were doled out a slice. The staff were very nice and friendly. To me it seemed pretty pricey too, and I would have expected something better
4
We took our mom here to celebrate her birthday and it was a special one. The played the birthday song over the PA and the staff sang together and my mom got a free birthday cake. The seafood selection was great and it was fresh.
4
Very great selection of food and desserts although it can be pricy. Pretty international spread. A good and presentable venue for bringing international guests. You can request for special corner...
5
Amazing Buffet Breakfast...best ever! I would definitely recommend this place for a good breakfast in the morning, one to remember...
5
Thumbs up! World class buffet dishes and world class service!
The Filipino Manager is very pleasant!
4
The selection of food was huge! Local delights, to Japanese food & not to mention the seafood. It was basically non-stop eating!
5
The seafood is fresh and tasty. Really large variety of options to pick. And this is also one of the main selling point compared to other hotel buffet. Love their prawns and lobsters. The other similar standard seafood buffet would be Aqua marine , which is more expensive. The hot dish is also good , although I am too full to try all of them. The kebab is delicious. The salad is also very good, serving with difference dressing. The lime tart and cream bulee is the best dessert . However the cake and cookie need improvement. Even cannot catch up with normal bread shop like four seasons or bread talk . Overall, it is lovely dinning experience . Remember make reservation
5
I have tasted Carousel Buffet few times now, mostly dinner. It has never disappoint and my parents love it too! To start off, the service from the staff is one of the best crew I've experienced. They are welcoming and personal. There is a great spread at the buffet, ranging from appetizers to desserts. For dinner, a range of fresh seafood is served. The desserts corner is worth mentioning too. All the cakes and pastries are worthy trying, so remember to leave space for desserts! They have very yummy bread and butter pudding and the lovely fondue for children. The food choices for lunch is slightly lesser but still more than satisfactory. The chefs offer special menus on special occasions too.Many guests celebrate birthdays and anniversaries at Carousel. A request can be made with the staff in advance and a pretty little cupcake will be presented to the birthday boy/girl. The last time I visited the restaurant, the crew has come up with an entertaining celebratory dance for all their guests. It brightens up everyone's evening!Just a note that it is important to make advance reservations as the restaurant is usually full. It would be good to try to book 2 months ahead, especially if the day of visit is a special occasion
5
A worthy buffet with wide variety of food ranging from japanese, eastern, western cuisine, salad bar, dessert etc. The seafood are very fresh and nice. I like the dessert and frozen yogurt very much. Remember to make reservation to avoid disappointment. Surprising moment when all the staff have a simple dance accompanying with bday song. They also serve a small cake with candle for those who celebrating their birthday. It is really an awesome and surprising bday celebration for my love. :
5
Excellent dinning experience at Carousel today over lunch! It was my birthday & my sis happened to see a staff preparing a mini cake for another guest & asked if they could prepare for me too...all without my knowing. The next thing was ALL STAFF lined in a row sing & dance a birthday song for 2 birthday guest! Great job! Sincerely thank you all for making my day!
5
Went for a company dinner on a Sunday.The spread of food is simply marvellous! The staff are friendly and prompt to service, especially when it comes to clearing empty plates.As it was a large group, we were able to get the Stateroom, so we were away from the crowd. When walking around the food area, I noticed the diners appeared very cramped. Too many people at too many tables. Food: amazing. Especially enjoyed the Veal Ribs in Honey Confit and the clams (very clean, very sweet). The main attraction of course is the chocolate fountains - they have not one, but THREE different fountains. Rather overwhelmed with the spread, so was not able to try everything. But the food that I did try was top-notch, as is to be expected for such a high price and reputation. Will definitely recommend to those who are seeking a high quality buffet
5
The service was excellent - warm and happy servers made us feel comfortable and like we were at home. A great experience made better by the amazing array of food. Seafood was fresh and available in abundance. Must try!
5
Excellent service. Prompt response to reservation with reminder before the day itself. Excellent array of food. Pleasant birthday cake surprise. Very very happy indeed!
5
Did not disappoint us,we tried for 3 days to get a table for two finally we got it last Saturday night ,so much first grade food to list,I give it excellent all the way,must do if visiting Singapore .

I had free breakfast at the Carousel Restaurant during my stay at Royal Plaza on Scotts. The chicken sausages and scrambled egg were cold when I had breakfast at 6.40 am. The dim sum was hard and unpalatable. There was a reasonable selection of food and I enjoyed the cheese and biscuit and the fresh fruit. I think the food here is halal as there were only chicken sausages on offer in the breakfast buffet. I would have preferred pork sausages. Bacon was not served. I was not impressed with the buffet breakfast
5
Firstly, the food was incredible. We had dine at Carousel numerous times but it was our first this year. There were new changes, e.g. teppanyaki station, dimsum station. And several more new menu. It was refreshing indeed! Even though I couldn't eat seafood due to allergies, there were many other varieties of food I enjoyed! The crowd : We dine on a Saturday (dinner), it was very packed. Too many people with too many tables and chairs everywhere. It was difficult to walk around at certain timing. It gets bit squeeze when queuing up for the ice cream and other stations. I also noticed that some of the stations food were messy (e.g.: the ladle, food crumbs on the stations)Service : TOP NOTCH! Enjoyed the service. By far, highlight of the evening. The floor staff were very friendly. They surprised us with an anniversary cake, took pictures and even dropped an email to me that night. That small little gesture was indeed heartwarming. Certainly, a return customer anytime soon! Thank you Carousel, Royal Plaza on Scotts staffs
5
The buffet spread for Carousel regardless on whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner are simply marvelous. My mum went to the high tea spread and she loves it and still remembers it till now. I have tried breakfast, lunch and dinner and i must say i was not disappointed at any of the times. Staffs were friendly and greeted you with a huge smile. Food is always fresh and tasty. Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a satisfying meal
5
What an awesome dinner experience. Staff was friendly quick and attentive to our needs:) Lin, we believe is the manager/supervisor made it more memorable by surprising us with a complementary anniversary cake. Together with Mathi, Wan Wei, Engelbert made our dinner more special and enjoyable. Keep it up guys!!:
5
Had a wonderful stay at RP and dined in the Carousel restaurant for breakfast and dinner.The choice of seafood for dinner was awesome. Fresh oysters, king crab, rib of beef and delicious cakes. Felt very full and satisfied.Complements to Englebert (dinner) and Adrian / Mega (breakfast) who were the most attentive and friendly service staff. We were welcomed warmly by Seri and Nishan
5
1st dinner experience at Corousel with my wife on her birthday. Food is wide spread, seafood section is reasonable with lobster as 1 of the main entree. Meat is a bit tough for me, maybe I'm not use to it. oyster is abundance but size is mid, could do better with bigger shells, maybe it's the season of the year. Other dishes are pretty much international buffet & tasted reasonable.Importantly, it's the service that count. My wife was given a birthday song & a cake with a picture as memo, makes our day! Well done & thank you
4
We were brought here on our last night in Singapore before going home. We arrived before it opened and there were many customers waiting for it to open. Great selection of Asian cuisine. Take time to go around the different food stations before choosing small portions. It's not advisable for those watching their weight!
3
Food ok, but too many tables close together, cafeteria style of eating. Difficult to get up and down.
4
dined with my colleagues in this place for lunch buffet.
no regrets and will still come back.
Good variety and service was good too.
5
We were spoilt for choice during the morning buffet session! Chinese dim sum, Japanese Sushi, Malaysian Char Kuey Teow, Singapore fried mee hoon, you name it they have it! Try for once and you will be keep coming back for more.....
3
Very wide spread however the dining area was huge thus a lot of people which makes it seem like mass market.. Quite fresh..
3
They have a good spread. Only down side was the use of thick soy sauce for the sashimi at that time.
4
The ambience was good, food selection was amazing and cater to everyone needs. The dessert selection was over whelming too!
4
Money to quality ratio is probably the best in Singapore for International buffet. As a sashimi lover, the Sashimi section is my favourite.
4
I would very much love to come here with my malay colleagues and friends since it's halal-certified. It's one of the better halal places to dine at without hurting the wallet too much. Wide spread of seafood, with generous servings of prawns n shell food. Came here for a department lunch and it was packed. Not exactly a quiet place for dining
5
Our family had the chance to celebrate our anniversary by having a lunch buffet at the Carousell at Scotts Plaza.The place is cozy and inviting to try out the various local and international cuisines. We really get excited to taste every food there is on the plate, as it was presented in a neatly, colorful way to tempt our taste buds. We enjoyed the food as it was delicious, and bountiful to the serving. We feasted on the freshness of the seafoods that we normally could not buy coz its expensive. We tried every dish from local, Japanese, Western, Indian cooking, plus the variety of mouth watering cakes, pastries, desserts, fruits and drinks. We ended up adjusting our belts to squeeze in all the food stuffs. It was a delightful dinning experience plus the fact the staff, waiters and chefs are nice. They even sing and dance for a birthday celebrant that day which made our day a memorable one. :-
4
The food at Carousel is simply very fresh. There is a wide selection of seafood and cold foods as there is cooked food. The food is quickly replenished before the dish is completely empty. The staff are very attentive to the needs of the guests. The staff are polite and respectful. Celebrated our daughter's birthday. Each birthday celebrant was given a slice of cake. Staff performed a simple dance routine singing the birthday song. This simple performance delighted every guest. Will certainly make another trip to Carousel
4
Good variety of food good taste especially dessert. Good service even though it is Buffett self service. Will sure recommend to friends. My commendation to the chefs.
5
Was impressed by their wide variety and that the food was good and the price was reasonable. I remember paying around S$50++ per person for lunch on a weekend ... Worth going if you're around that area and would like a good buffet!
4
Bring my staffs for buffet to celebrate SG50. Food was great, service was good.

Looking at the ratings and being a guest of the hotel I felt tempted to try this place (where I also have breakfast every morning).The experience has been poor. There is a good variety of stations and a good range of different food, but quality is definitely low. Everything is very standard, overcooked and lack any form of real attention to execution.Also, (and this is my bias), the idea to celebrate birthday parties with a song and dance of all the serving staff is depressing....Service is very good and courteous. Price is on the high end, but quantity is "all you can eat", so it's up to you to make it worthMost definitely not for fodies
5
The best place to celebrate Birthday's and Occassions.Ambience was good, Service was excellent.Food was Fantastic. No words to describe...Its the BEST !My daughter celebrates her 17 Birthday at Carousel...The cake with a candle lighted up with a team who sang her birthday song.She's so touched....tears of joy
4
We arrived at the restaurant at about 8.00pm after a long tiring trip from Europe. It was apparent that most of the other diners were well ahead of us and were devouring deserts as we entered. The festivities were beginning at large tables where people were celebrating birthdays etc. Most of those tables were occupied by fairly young people and the noise level was higher than we would have preferred. On a couple of occasions a number of the staff gathered and performed a catchy “all singing-all dancing” rendition of Happy Birthday. In actual fact it was quite good and we joined in the singing although we had absolutely no idea for whom the performance was for.The fairly unique idea of the restaurant is that there are a number of stations, all offering a particular type of cuisine. There is seafood, sushi, Indian, Asian, and Western to name a few. The restaurant operates on a smorgasbord basis so that you can trundle back fill up on whatever takes your fancy. We thought that the offering was of particularly high quality however the reality was that we were late and the prime portions of the food we were interested in had long since disappeared. Having said that we thought that our dinner to that point was quite acceptable, though not up to the standard we were expecting. The moral of the story is “do not be late”.All was forgiven when we arrived at the point when the next course on the agenda was desert. The diversity of fruit, pastries and other magnificent treats was mind blowing. We waddled out well satisfied having started out on a fairly average note and finished well satisfied.We thought the bill was high although not unreasonable (especially the drinks), although we do not profess to be experts on Singapore prices
3
We stayed for 3 nights at the Royal Plaza and had our breakfast included. Although there was always something for anyone's choice I expected a much more extensive buffet. I expected more choice in Asian warm dishes not being dim sums or Indian food. Also because of the hotel being 5* and all the awards the restaurant received I expected a higher quality. Some of the food was lukewarm and the coffee for instance was terrible.Staff was very good though
4
Visited this place for a relative's birthday lunch on a weekend. The food and spread was really worth it, plus the sausages taste really good! They also have a wide range of desserts that suits any palate.It was pretty crowded there but fortunately, we had booked the private room that day. We had a really helpful waitress who cleared our plates and refilled our water promptly.Good place to visit if you have the extra dough. Recommended to call beforehand to book tables before going down
3
There is a wide selection of food ranging from local, Japanese, Indian, etc. the seafood is fresh and yummy especially the prawns. The service is good despite the weekend crowd. Once you are done, your plate is cleared almost immediately. One of my colleagues mentioned that the soup is cold, the waiter immediately warm up a bowl for her
5
it was my partners 29th birthday and he wanted mo to try carousels buffet. awesome! the shrimp on a curry sauce with kaffir lime is a must try hmmm couldn't stop thinking about it :) . staff was very accommodating, place was very cozy though it was a full house when we went there, overall great food, awesome interiors, very friendly staff :)
4
Casually mentioned my hubby's birthday on that day and he likes Carousel Buffet when making reservation..... We were caught by surprised of Birthday cake & song, follow by family photo taken. Excellence service and heart warming dinner. Thank you
4
There are a great variety of food and the seafood was fresh. However there's a little disappointment on the dessert selection as there are few selection on taste normal.
5
had dinner at Carousel, was greeted with a warm welcome, excellent service always smiling and cheerful staff, buffet spread excellent moneys worth.
5
I have been here countless times and the food always meets my expectations. My favorite station is the pasta station, where the chefs always prepare the pasta professionally and with lots of effort. On this particular visit, chef Yoke Meng prepared my pasta and it was excellent
5
Another success birthday celebration at Carousel. With the help of their dedicated staff, my daughter's 21st birthday was such a success. The major credit go to the Chef / Chefs who did the Mini Cupcakes that I've ordered from GOURMET CAROUSEL. They were so beautiful and all of us were speechless and jaws drop when it was served. We salute to the Chef / Chefs who did them. The staff were all so kind and helpful. I really appreciate all the effort they have put in. Everyone out there take note, Carousel is one of the best place you can enjoy the wide spread of food and feel the warm from the staff. Thumb up
5
First visit to celebrate our princess 7th Birthday ! Great experience with unexpected birthday song played and offered a mini cake to my girl. We are very delighted with the excellent service provided too. Wide spread of delicious food and dessert with great service definitely worth to come back again 
5
We would visit this place for a large gathering of sorts. Carousel offers a wide variety of seafood and food of different themes on different occassions. There is always something for everyone to eat. The oysters are especially fresh and good everytime we ate there. No doubt, one of the best buffet restaurants out there
4
When I first came to book this restaurant, I had no idea that my family was going to give a mini surprise for me. the seafood section was splendid, I had enjoyed the fresh bbq prawns the chef had made at a live station. a wide selection of desserts as well, I loved the fondue! dipped with marshmallows and nothing can go wrong.special thanks to the whole carousel staff who had sung for me and even did a mini dance. quite the celebration!Definitely would come here again if im craving for some buffet style
4
We celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary Wonderful spread and delicious food! Service was friendly and warm. We even received a cake to mark the occasion although the cake was a let down. Having said that the desserts at the buffet itself was amazing and such a wide choice as well. Kids enjoyed the choc fountain, ice cream and froyo
5
I bring my husband here to celebrated his birthday. Restaurant not only give us a birthday cake, but also choice us for special guest on the day and arranged Pornask present us another cake(a lot of video recorder let us feel like movie star!) I'm definitely will come back again!
4
Went there for a post birthday dinner of hubby. Although it was full packed when we visited, the quality of food and service is still commendable. Hubby was served with small birthday cupcake as well.
3
been here twice.
the desserts selection has dropped.
food wise pretty normal.
don't really feel it's worth the price anymore.
5
Another visit...another splendid experience. Food is tasty as ever. Oyster omelette is very rich not stingy on e oyster. THUMBS UP!!!!!!
5
Come hungry and leave stuffed. Everything was so good. There is a huge variety of dishes from all over the world. We especially liked the paella and cook to order pasta station. Save room for all the chocolate fondue fountains.
3
Quality of the food average but surprisingly packed. The service was above average unfortunately the number of good stations are not as extensive as they charge pretty close to the Line at the Shangri la
4
The food was good. Plenty of assortments. Lack of bacon though =(((
There are a lot of Indonesian and Malaysian guests so I think they have to meet Muslim sensibilities which I can understand if its their main customer base =)
4
Stayed at the hotel so thought we'd give the buffet restaurant a try, after all the hype we'd heard about it. Good variety of foods for both Eastern and Western palates, but nothing spectacular.
5
The food spread is wide. Eat all you can but at a smaller portion so that you have more food tasting to go on. Visit with an empty stomach.
4
We have been to this buffet many many times and keep going back. Just ensure that you book in advance as it is one of the best buffet around offering good quality for money.
5
Had a very lovely dining experience at Carousel. Without the need to specially request, service staff was considerate enough to assign a spacious corner seat near the buffet line for us knowing that we were coming in with a pram. Seating was also pre arranged nicely with baby seat and dining set. The food was fresh and delicious too
5
Best service ever. Advance booking to avoid dissapointment as its always full house.Gd job. Will definitely come back.Varieties to choose from. You will never regret.
1
Came to Singapore with my family to celebrate Hari Raya Lebaran in this restaurant. Firstly there is no special menu to celebrate the festival. Secondly, though they have Indian, Chinese, Western section, this place is about quantity, no longer about quality. Very disappointing experience.
4
Although a bit pricy but it is a quite unique experience. Especially if it is your first time with such a buffet. I liked all food sections. Just do not rush when eating ;)
2
Good spread, loved the raw seafood, but the cooked food section is disappointing. The roast beef was dry and tough, had a hard time getting through it. The price is still high but the overall standards have fallen. Not going back anytime soon.
5
We had breakfast here on several days. Huge selction of foods on offer and lots cooked to order. Different selections each day which was nice.
3
I only touched on the Japanese & cold seafood sections for this buffet. Though they were reasonably fresh I felt the price should come down abit espcially on a weekday.The reason it is overpriced is due to the demand for the buffet. For this price, I will only go once in a very long time as there're other buffet as good or better.Cook food section is nothing exciting & u can find better dishes in other buffets. Frozen yogurt ice cream is something special & help you in digestion :) Service is prompt in removing the table plates but otherwise they're abit busy to attend to your other needs. Gotto look for them. Staff there will dance for you on your birthday & offer a free small cake too
3
I am not a big fan of this place, because the food is just average yet it is expensive. I only came here because it is certified Halal, which at least caters to my Muslim friends. However, I must say there are many better buffet places nowadays in town, and I think Carousel can be given a miss to give other better places a chance
3
we were invited to this place by our bosses for annual gathering. the only reason we chose this place is because that it is 1 of the few HALAL buffet you can find in Singapore. the price is quite pricey! they have a large variety of food, from western to Chinese, Indian to Japaneses, pastries and ice- cream are good too it can be quite crowded on holiday eve or weekend eve. be sure to enjoy all the food, especially the CRAB ( star of the food ). service can be VERY SLOW even for a glass or water. if you compare this place with " hotel's " buffet...well..its not up to the standard,but if you are not a fussy eater, well..this place is considered NOT BAD.. yet most importantly its HALAL, so alot of Muslim friends can join the meal together :) nice place to chill and chit chat as they have quite a spacious place
4
i like the bright and easy look of this place. It gives a nice warmth feeling to help the appetite and when you look at the spread, your tongue drools aided by the colors of the food displayed. wide offer of food and the place is halal so you can bring along any friend, Muslim or otherwise. clean and friendly environment and there is a bar above that is quiet and relaxing. only appeal is the walk from the car park to be better thought out and planned as well as improving the car park area
4
Had the full buffet breakfast every morning of our stay and it was seriously good although took me to the very last day to realise they was to be NO bacon and eggs ! Of course it was not PC to have pork meats at this establishment , but hey there was plenty other meats to choose from. The fruits were so fresh and lovely and the wait staff very attentive and nice. Highly recommended !
1
Second time here. The seafood is disappointing. The seafood section, especially the oyster is not as good as the first one.
5
Came for lunch to celebrate my girl birthday in advance and she is so surprised with
the birthday song and cake which she love it and ate it all by herself !!
4
butter prawns, beef teppanyaki, chilled prawns, skewered prawns, kebab, desserts were all amazing. the indian corner had no butter chicken though :(
5
Carousel dinner buffet had never failed to amaze me and this time their breakfast wooo me big time.
Awesome spread, great varieties. Love it!!!
4
A great location at the top end of Orchard Road, particularly for Breakfast. The meals are fresh and plentiful.
3
Overall was average. The sashimi are not very fresh and there are limited desserts to choose from. Ambeience was quite cozy as it was in a room.

Went over for my fiance's birthday celebration and have been there perhaps 2 years ago before this.I am still impressed with their good service, as I was two years ago. Receptionist and service staffs were very efficient and friendly. Price of the buffet for dinner was mid-range. You can purchase a jug of Juice for $22 (the Cloudy Apple is worth the try!). The Cold Dishes were really fresh and I have to say it was one of the better lobsters and crabs I have tasted. The buffet spread was good too, with a variety of range to choose from and not forgetting the dessert counters (Creme Brulee, Brownies, Chocolate Fondue Fountain, Ice Creams, Puddings)Staffs made an effort every night for birthday cakes to be sent out with candles and a birthday song. Marvellous effort done by the staffs and I am glad I chose Carousel.Worth the visit however I can see that there is a drop in quality of food as compared to my first visit there. Nevertheless, good job Carousel

Lots of different types of food typical of many buffets in Singapore. I actually want to rank it as good instead of average but the next option in Trip Adviser is V good.The problem with having too much of a good thing is that it all become a blur. Nothing stood out - both bad or good. Actually nothing bad to complain about

Came with my family to celebrate my parents' birthday. My parents were surprised with the birthday song and cakes. Enjoyed the superb variety and quality of food. Love the generous spread of cakes, fondues, yoghurt, bread & butter puddings etc - best that i've ever tried {esp cakes!} and also love the aromatic lattes, cappuccinos & teas (unlike the diluted coffees/teas at other hotels). Staff were cheerful & friendly at restaurant and even on the phone (when i made my reservation). AWESOME FOOD & SERVICE. Thanks to all staff at Cafe Carousel and for the beautiful photo
5
We ate here tonight (2 adults and 2 kids). It isn't Vegas, but it was extremely good in range and quality. Little crayfishes, crab, sushi, salmon,etc. We didn't buy any drinks, but the service was still great refilling our water. Great meal, worth getting a taxi to find.
4
Finally here with wife to celebrate my birthday and was surprised by their staff singing a birthday song and complimentary cake for me.
Already a wonderful day today but they made it better with good food and service. Thanks for the beautiful photo too!
5
I always eating and spending time here..
All varieties in this restaurant.
And the mango dessert is perfect.
Should try!
4
This is a vast buffet featuring many different cuisines, much of it freshly made. The options for breakfast were overwhelming. I could try something different every day of the week. I should have come back for dinner.
5
Went there for hubs birthday lunch treat with family. Excellent place and service. Thank you! Will go again
5
Had a wonderful dinner buffet with friends and family good spread of food and the sashimi and fresh oysters were exquisite. Only setback was the manoeuvring between tables with our plates of food. Tricky. All in, a wonderful place to chat and catch up and eat. I would recommend this restaurant to any visitor in Singapore as it caters to every one's taste bon a petite!
5
Brought family to celebrate Mother's Day here. Food selection was superb & a big spectrum. Price is reasonable for the food quality & spread. Service was good, friendly, efficient, & helpful. Ambience was cosy & comfy. Parking was ample & easy. Would i recommend, oh a big yes to whoever asking me where to eat. Thanks to management, chefs, kitchen hands, & waiting staff

From sushi to dimsum, from teppan to chicken rice, from eastern to western, and from soft cream to triple choc fondue!!Reservation in advance is suggeste
5
Great variety and the staff are very attentive and welcoming. Stayed at the hotel 6 days 2015, and every two years from when it was named Holiday Inn on Scotts Road. It was good then, but now even better as Royal Plaza onScotts Rd, and is a non-smoking hotel so makes it so pleasant to have breakfast at their wonderful buffe
5
Once again, the Carousel Buffet did not disappoint us. Great selection of food together with excellent service. Staff was as usual very polite and obliging. We stay at the Royal Plaza every time we visit Singapore at least annually if not twice a year and always feel welcomed back.
4
I was on course for two days at the hotel and we hv our lunch at the place. On the outlook it is very grand n cosy for dinning. The food has a lot to choose. With japanese food like sashimi n cool noodles n sushi. There is a cakes n fruits session . Then there are cold seafood section but dont hv oyster. Then they hv bbq section. Further in there is cooked food like vegetible . Fish. Etc. There is also salad n soup area. There are chicken rice n rooast pork n curry n prata... too many choices.. very good place to eat 
4
This place offer a multi-cuisine buffet.
The variety is pretty good, specially if you want to try sea food.
Its very fresh and the taste is good.
5
Great place for both lunch & dinner in town. Wide spread of foods variety across the different section.
4
Variety = 4/5
Service = 3.5/5
Ambience = 3.5/5
It gets bit rowdy and noisy when i had lunch because of more than 2 groups of table of 6
4
I had my birthday dinner here. And I can say one thing. The service was excellent the food is tasty the place is clean and exclusive!
4
They have a great spread of buffet and it is like a mini buffet of Shangrila, The Line. I love their dessert areas. Fresh seafood, sushi counter, other international food like big salmon, Italian cuisines and have good quality of food like Indian cuisines.
5
We enjoyed an amazing buffet experience in the Carousel on the last night of our stopover to home (as hotel guests), highly recommended. Booking a few days ahead is essential as it gets so busy. The variety of international cuisine is endless, all delicious dishes and sauces, and the staff service was wonderful, friendly, efficient and courteous. All the staff gathered to sing birthday wishes to some of the guests, lots of fun and happiness shown by all! Cost was good value. Thank you for a great night, a memorable gourmet experience in a delightful atmosphere
5
Me & my wife had a great experience and the service they provided were beyond word. As we are celebrating our Anniversary, everything was beautiful. Though some items/food were not there, there were other new ones. Nonetheless, we will come again in the future. Insya Allah. God Bless you guys
5
What not to love about Carousel Buffet. you want fresh sashimi, there you can have it. You want you kue dadar, there you can have it also. Or you feel like having rotisserie chicken, you can have it too. And you still have room for your roti canai/prata, just go to its Indian section. You want your Its Western, Japanese, Mediterranean, and local dishes are served in very good quality
4
I visited this restaurant for dinner three times and twice for lunch on weekdays. It is a great place for large groups of ten or more but reserve early to avoid disappointment. I believe it is halal or at least Muslim friendly. The seafood on ice is amazing with fresh oysters, crab, prawns and clams. Sashimi and sushi are so so. The cheese platter is reasonably good too, as is the salad bar. They have western roasts, laksa and pastas cooking stations, indian curries, mediterranean food including a variety of antipasti, and chinese style braised meats and vegetables. They offer finger food which kids love. For dessert you can find chocolate fondue in 2 or 3 flavours with all sorts of things to dip in. Their ice creams and cake are acceptable too. They even serve macaroons
5
Went for lunch buffet on 12 June 2015 with a good friend and we had a truly awesome time! Wide variety of dishes and food - from seafood to dessert, we were spoilt for choice! Food was fantastic and fresh! Service was superb! Highly recommended! One of the best buffet in town!
3
very well known buffet restaurant, located in scotts road.
the food selection is wide, but personally I did not anyone of them is signature dish.
price paid is high.
3
That it a nice and great place to take the lunch. In this hotel have so many food and drinks let us to try. The environment is also very good. The food also so fresh.
4
Quite a variety of local and international cuisines. The cold dishes are also fresh. The bread and butter pudding is a must!
4
the atmosphere is great. all food is strategically placed. hot while serving and seafood fresh. staff is professional. often smile. up to expectations.
1
Not a buffet to be raved about. Even though there are lots of variety but it doesnt leave an impact on you after tasting the food. Ambience was not really pleasant either. Furthermore the price is really steep and not really worth it. There are other better buffet out there
4
My friend and I decided to have lunch here as we have been hearing good reviews about their buffet. I would say that Carousel is one of the best place to indulge on good food. They have a huge variety of dishes that are deliciously good such as sashimi, lobsters, lamb chops and many more. Check out their Seafood, Japanese station and the wide spread of desserts. Service was excellent - staff were friendly, attentive and efficient. We had a gastronomic feast and will definitely come back again
5
Singapore has a multitude of buffets, but none can really compare to the consistent quality delivered at Carousel. With a wide range of options I have found the quality to be very good across all cuisine types. Tourists will be surprised to know that the hotel is actually owned by the Sultan of Brunei , local gossip has it that during his visits to Singapore he couldn't find halal food up to his liking, so he decided to buy the hotel and transform the Carousel into a halal buffet. Whether there is a shred of truth in that story I will never know, but I think its an interesting proposition ! Due to its sustained popularity, I recommend going earlier - I don't believe they take reservations but best to call to double check that
3
Was invited to carousel by aunt who organised the event... ate quite a meal however what is rather disappointing is the dessert. I love creme brulee as that is my favorite dessert, it was bitter n overburnt. Maybe they should be extra careful with the desserts regardless of what they are. The rest of the meals are not bad... Since i wasn't paying for the meal i wouldn't say if it is inexpensive or reasonable.
4
We went to the buffet for dinner and there's a wide variety of food served. I find that the desserts especially are great and many choices to choose from. Ordering drinks is not cheap and not inclusive of the buffet. Plain water is complementary. Plus points is that it is also halal. Definately should go if you love desserts
3
For our Muslims friends and those who are keen to bring your friends from overseas to a halal certified buffet venue, this will be the ideal choice as it is in orchard area and next to DFS(Duty Free Shop).. Their spread is quite international and I suggest to make reservations if you intend to go on Friday nights or weekends... ;)
5
Was Royal Plaza on Scotts for 2 day course.
Dining at Carousel Buffet makes the day. There were so many dishes to from.
Have our lunch there really perk up the day.
4
One of the few halal buffet around Singapore. Decent spread of food and an above average dessert section.
4
I organized our company dinner and have chose Carousel because the foods are Halal and different choice of foods. I truly love the desserts corner. Yummy!
5
I always come back to this place for its great yummy international spread of food choices. The service staff are very polite and excellent in service too.
4
Yummy food... More variety of choice at the buffet counter... Cold dishes are really fresh... Dessert all 👍tempting and l love it so much!
4
Not bad, quite a variety for patrons to choose. The food quite fresh. Make sure you make a reservation before going down.
5
Carousel Staff are friendly and accommodating. The environment is clean and great and most of all the food tastes great. This is my 5th time going to Carousel and I will continue to frequent Carousel.
5
Recommended for everyone. The buffet have lots of varieties of food. Most of the food is nice. No complaints for the food I've eaten. My wife surprised me on my birthday and I received a birthday cake from them. The ambience of the restaurant is very cosy. No regrets. Just wanting to go there again. *drools
4
There is just a lot of variety for this buffet. International, asian, japanese, etc. Salads, main dishes, desserts. The food looks good, especially the desserts but tastes average only. The seafood wasnt fresh either. Mid way through the lunch they started to play a loud music. Then we realize it was birthday song. The staff was clapping to the music too. Everyone was looking around to see who the birthday person was. They had 4 slices of cake with a candle each. At the end of the song, they presented me with a cake. Thanks to my hubby and children who arranged it and the kind gesture from the restaurant. Then i realise actually there are quite a number of people born today to
4
Went for their lunch buffet for my wedding anniversary & my mum's birthday treat.Delicious & variety of food ranging from western, asian, cold dish & marvellous dessert!!!Got 2 suprised cake for our special occasion. Love the food, great service from the staff. Overall worth the money spend on the food
5
Great service, good surroundings and good quality food. There is something for even the fussy eaters!
5
Love the sashimi, lobsters, lamb chops, crabs, sea food stir fry, sea food salad, naam bread, curry and the most important one, my lovely birthday cake. Just it would be great if there were some more choices of drinks.
5
The Carousel is one of the best buffets I've ever had, in terms of huge variety, numbers of dishes, quality of food and overall experience. The service was excellent as well: attentive, friendly and efficient, which rounded off our dining experience marvellously.
5
Hello all, my family and I had dinner here yesterday and I must say that the food was absolutely delicious. Asides from the food, the staff were friendly, accommodating and helpful! My recommendation: try their pasta booth (look for Robert!).
Worth every penny!
4
I stayed at this excellent hotel for one week, and had breakfast each morning at the Carousel Buffet. This catered to every taste from cereals to fresh Tropical fruits, scrambled egg, turkey bacon,{not keen!}, turkey chipolatas{again not so nice, but remember a lot of cooks and guests are Muslims and don't eat pork. }In the evening, there is a great selection of food, from all types of curries, sambals, stir fries, to salads, fresh fruit,different cheeses, breads and rolls. My only gripe is that at S$86 -per person its a bit expensive. For S$36.50. I could have a celebratory end of Ramadan meal, in my room, of fresh dates, Nasi goreng or chicken Pilaff, plus a veg curry ,roti bread,,a platter of tropical fruits, and a delicious drink called bandung which is made with rose water, pomegranate syrup, coconut and condensed milk, and is to die for! A MUCH cheaper option for me than the full Buffet meal, and so delicious
4
This is my 6th visit and even my children love the wide spread of food & dessert. Upon request for birthdays, they will serve a slice of cake the "Birthday Person" for free and accompanied by birthday song. The hot favorite is the Seafood & Japanese Station. Next is the beautifully display of cakes, the Chocolate Fountain with 3 different flavors. This time the only setback is the duck meat which was not tender and tasted very chewy. Overall the food is nice but worth the price. Reservation is suggested as the restaurant is always seem to be packed especially in the evening (dinner). Service is very good right from the receptionist to the staff that collect used dishes. They are courteous and always put on their smiles that make diners felt very welcomed. Keep up the good work
4
My family of four went Carousel to celebrate my wife birthday and our wedding anniversary. I'm glad I have chosen Carousel as our celebration venue. The restaurant present us with complimentary slices of cakes with candle on it. The food is nice and the service is of high standard. The staff were friendly, nice and helpful. My 2 kids have had a great time savoring their favorite desserts. Thank you for the wonderful experience! We will be back
4
My husband, my friends and I had a business lunch at carousel buffet in Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel. The buffet is halal and has a lot of variety. I loved their roasted beef, fish, and vegetables. Desserts has to be improved. We will come to have a good dinner for the next business trip in Singapore again
4
It was my 4th wedding anniversary and my wife and I enjoyed the lunch buffet. The selection was plenty, with seafood at its freshest. Loved the crayfish, prawns and sashimi. Service was good too, staff came frequently to clear empty plates although the venue was almost full house. Appreciate the lovely piece of cake for our anniversary and the photo taken and emailed to us. Will come back again for special occasion celebrations
4
I went for the lunch buffet on a weekday and the restaurant was packed. There was a large variety of food, with the Japanese food being the best. I really enjoyed the sashimi and sushi - it was very fresh! There was plenty of Asian food as well and the desserts were amazing. Don't miss out on the yoghurt station in the corner. Service was good too. Good for special occasions
4
tried the buffet at the royal plaza on Scotts, there was a nice selection of buffet food however the service was very slow and fragmented, the buffet display did not match the quality of the food,
5
The food variety is splendid...the service is wonderful...if they can include free flow of wine or beer to go along with the food will be perfect. I don't mind paying extra for the free flow of alcoholic beverages...
4
Celebrating my wedding anniversary there. Was surprised by their surprises and good service. Wide variety of food selection too. Worth visiting again.
5
Carousel has always been my favourite buffets for dinner with my family and friends. We love the food and the variety of it. Not to forget the excellent customer service of their staff. We will keep coming back!
4
Been there once - the place is expensive ( costs around70++ for lunch) but good choice. Particularly liked the sea food selection and dessert sections.
5
Omg! Wide spread of seafood! Fantastic! So fresh and quality is high class! Superb! Keep it up! Im bringing more friends... :)
5
I like my food. And this place delivers food. Great food. Unlimited. I found it difficult walking back to a hotel.
4
I was treated at Carousel Buffet on Mother's Day. They had a free photo booth which guests are entitled to 1 printout free (for couple, if you need a 2nd copy, they will charge $1)Good and fresh raw seafood spread, not forgetting the usual intercontinental spread from cooked food station.Definitely one of the better buffets to try in Orchard Area.Price is on the high side, about $89 nett per pax
2
We read about this place on Tripadvisor and with so many positive reviews we expected that the dinner would be perfect. But it wasn't. There are some negative moments, first it's low quality for asked price, you can't ask almost 100 $ ( dinner price + water + service) for dinner and offer the food like in cheap Chinese " all you can it" restaurant. Second, there was not so big choice of dishes, many luxury hotels offer much better buffet. Third, the atmosphere, it's not a place for a special dinner, more look like ordinary cafeteria where everybody is shouting. Will I advice for some one? No, never. I' ll say if you want to waste your money, go to Carousel
4
Carousel has it all. Asian, western, local delicacies for all age groups. A wide array of dishes will get you moving from your table to the buffet spread within minutes. And if I'm not wrong, private room to cater to families of more than 7 people will be provided on first come first serve basis but you need to double check with reservations if they are indeed available. Price per head is not that wallet-friendly however. A buffet dinner can go up as high as S$83++ per head for adult and S$49++ for kids. If they can slashed 20% of the bill, that will be more appropriate. Else, I will go elsewhere to find the same spread for much much cheaper
2
Poor variety of food for the price paid. Fresh fruit was minimal and once again very poor selection. Layout of dinning area was a bit haphazard. At $28.00 a head we could find a better choice outside of the Hotel for half the price.
5
Its a wonderful experience. nice spread of sumptuous food with friendly staffs
Seafood are fresh and yummy!
3
A safe place to take Muslim guests. The hotel is owned by the Sultan of Brunei. The buffet is halal & fairly varied but if average quality, compared to the non-halal big buffet spreads elsewhere.
3
As it is a Halal-certified eatery, the selection is quite limited. But overall food quality is acceptable for the price.
5
Plenty of food choices, I tried each kind of sushi that was fresh serve. There are vegetarian food also. India food, seafood. All food well executed and tasty. When you celebrate birthday the staff will sing birthday song and dance for you.
5
The only place I would go for buffets.
The seafood is so fresh and kept replenished. So love their fresh seafood everytime.
Loved their creme caramel.
5
Went Carousel on the 23rd May 15 to celebrate my mum's birthday and I have to say everybody in our group of 8 really enjoy the food there. There is so much variety of food there that I don't think it's possible to try them all !! Seafood is really fresh and so is the Sashimi. When it comes to desert, they're also second to none, from ice-cream to pastries to chocolate fondue and the list goes on...
4
I have never been to Carousel Buffet at Royal Plaza on Scotts although as a singaporean. The hotel look abit rundown to me and the holding area was very pack that day when I visited. I have been to numerous hotel buffet and this particular buffet attract me with great service, although the food can be better.Upon entering the restaurant, waiters and waitresses where line up on after the other to bring you to the table. I would say the servicing staffs are more then adequate compared to the rest that i have visited. There are a mixed of local delight and Japanese food. It is worth a visit
4
We were 4 friends visiting Singapore prior to embarking on a cruise. We chose the Carousel to celebrate a birthday for one of our party. Having read the reviews, we had booked the restaurant approx. 3 months in advance to ensure we would get a table, and thank goodness we did as it was full to capacity. Excellent choices at the "live" cooking stations and the chefs were so friendly and helpful. Food was definitely first class. The waiting staff sang to the people celebrating their birthdays and it was a great experience overall. The only slight criticism we had was the cafeteria feel, background noise and bright lighting made it difficult to relax and chat after our meal
5
We've been to Carousel countless times, so this could be a little biased. It's a nice place for dating couples, for family gatherings, for staff bonding, for birthdays, anniversaries and any special occassion or just because you feel like gorging on good food (ahem).The spread varies from breakfast, lunch, high tea, dinner and on weekdays and weekends. Carousel breakfast is my personal favourite :)The biggest selling point is that it's halal (the kitchen is halal certified by MUIS, but the dining area is not. They will serve alcohol on request and in the past years, they've held champagne brunches). I suppose you could find better food and/or value for money if you don't have that halal requirement. The staff are a joy, some have basicaly watched my children grow up (we go there A LOT). They are friendly, helpful, quick to clear your dirty plates. Pricewise, it's a little steep but there are usually credit card discounts (15%) and when dining with kids (both under 7), they usually waive the charges for one of them. If you are staying at the hotel, don't charge the bill to your room because you won't get the discount off your dining bill
4
I like to go this place with friend as singapore doesn't have many nice and halal buffet. Carousel buffet has good variety of choice, I like oyster the most.
4
Came here to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Great spread of food & desserts. Ambience was nice for family gathering. The staffs were very thoughtful for surprising my hubby with a small cute cake with a candle on it. Overall delicious food and wonderful staffs.
5
I enjoyed the breakfast - there were ample of choices on offer- being British I chose the full English which was very tasty - the staff wer attentive and very polite - the restaurant was very clean and spotless -
4
Its a must visit place for sea food lovers jumbo prawns lobsters crabs you name it and they have it all .
3
I had a business lunch at carousel buffet in Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel. The buffet is halal and has a lot of variety. I loved their roasted beef, fish, and vegetables. Desserts has to be improved
4
It is closer to 3.5 stars as it is quite good as there is a good range of food on offer but with all buffets it is hard to keep all the food fresh and hot all the time.Having oysters was nice but they are frivolous with the Tabasco and the vinegar sauce is not correct type for oysters.The place is busy, friendly staff and so a nice atmosphere. Service is good and plate collection sufficient.The cakes to end the meal are quite deliciousTip: make sure you request a proper seat in the restaurant and not on the plastic chairs at the front
5
Carousel has been my favourite "go-to" place for seafood buffet for over a decade. Their seafood selections are always fresh & staff are constantly ensuring that the food are being "topped-up" when finish.It was very touching to see all the staff sing & dance a little while singing the "Happy Birthday" song. I would highly recommend Carousel for those that love seafood & bread pudding & Chocolate Fondue! Absolutely LOVE their bread pudding & Chocolate Fondue! They now have rose & green tea flavoured chocolate in additional to the milk chocolate. At Carousel, selections are plenty & all just simply delicious. Well done Carousel!
5
The best buffet lunch i've ever had in my life, fresh well prepared food. I can't even describe all the menu because it's a very huge spread, i believe the dinner buffet has more varieties than lunch. They also doing a very good job in dessert stall, there's about 20+ kind of desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth, superb.They charge 55/pax before tax for lunch, looks like expensive but actually it's not, i spend more dine in restaurant like Jumbo seafood with ala carte menu.The staffs do a very good job, they always consistent doing the service even when the place is packed with guests.Overall, Carousel will always be in my itinerary whenever i visit singapore, well done
5
Spread and quality of food is very good. Very impressed by the service level and the attention of staff. They are very prompt in removing used plates and very helpful and polite. Was impressed when the waiters and waitresses dance to the tune of birthday song for those celebrating their special day with them. They were each given a birthday cake. Will definitely come back again
5
Weekend buffet dinner is a great seafood night! There are so many many kinds of seafood: crab, lobster, prawn, oyster, salmon, tuna, ...... The dessert is excellent! There is a auto coffee machine for self-service and free water.I can't try all food because the variety of dishes. Everything is delicous. Well worth
5
Good food and good service. Wide variety of dishes...the desserts are so good. Worth the price.Definitely would come back again!!
5
The breakfast Buffett is huge with an amazing range of different foods. Delicious, highly recommend.
3
I don't think this place deserves to be so high ranked in Singapore.
For the same price you can enjoy a better meal in many other restaurants.
The only thing I really enjoyed here is the Chocolate fondue which was great.
5
Excellent experience at Carousel. It was Mother's Day Lunch plus Birthday for two of our guests. The quality of food at the buffet was very good. Service by the waiters was prompt and cheerful. There was a photo booth and a lucky draw for Mother's Day which my whole family enjoyed. It made my mum's day to have pictures taken with her grand children. Half way through lunch, the lights were dimmed and happy birthday songs was played. A slice of cake with a candle was given to each of our guests who were celebrating their birthdays. The only grouse I had was the sms confirmation of the reservation came from a foreign number and had to reply to ensure our reservation was not cancelled. I have yet to check if the sms reply sent would be charged. If it was, that would be a negative on my experience with Carousel.Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back
5
I decided to treat myself to a nice buffet on my last night before leaving Singapore and after reading up on many reviews- I was glad I did go to the Carousel Plaza!The food selection was great- I was initially worried from seeing a lot of pictures for cold seafood as I prefer hot...but I had nothing to worry about, cos there was loads to eat in the hot section. I thoroughly enjoyed the crab and prawns- I had second servings. My Pasta from the pasta section was good as well...and oh the Creme Brulee was great too!I have to say it was really beautiful when all the staff members came out to sing "Happy Birthday" for the celebrants dining there with a little cake for each of them- I wished it was my birthday too. Lol.All in all- it was a great dining experience and I would definitely go back
5
Carousel always my choice of buffet restaurant in list. With the price and quality food that they offer it really more than "worth" one word! It is heaven here for seafood lover. Frequently changing of new menu that lure me return to here again and again. Staff here are always nice and friendly. Their risotto are Superb, i recommend it so much! Remember to look after Chef Alex for that! He is kinda funny and nice person
5
We had a mini lunch gathering here, which happened to be at the lobby where were staying. The booking was easy thru the hotel. It was fully booked, with 10feet queue when we arrived 10 minutes before the opening. Lunch was served 12-2pm. Plenty of the regular buffet selections. I particularly enjoyed the Japanese food and the desert. Service was efficient and very friendly. The total number of guests are just nice that you don't bump into others
5
This is definitely the place to host gatherings especially if there is a birthday because a free birthday cake will be served!Not to mention, this is also 1 of the few halal buffets in Singapore with a excellent spread from fresh seafood to mouth watering desserts. Fell in love with the Aglio Olio pasta which is cooked on the spot and Teppanyaki dishes
5
We visited Carousel Buffett for my daughters birthday lunch during our week in Singapore. It was to die for. Rows upon rows of all sorts of food. So much seafood it was too hard to choose, then Asian ... Chinese, Indian, Thai ... Western of all description. Then there was dessert. Done in such a way that you could have six or seven to try them all ... And yes we did. A chocolate fountain or two and three different ice creams. Very highly recommended and great value for money. And surprise of surprise the bottled water was free
5
Went there for high tea and I must say the food spread is a lot and delicious.There is also free flow of hot and cold beverages. It was my anniversary day but didnt expect to get a surprise mini cake from them. thank you carousel staffs. So come to conclusion yes definitely recommended for high tea
5
Good is excellent and there is fresh seafood and sashimi for seafood lovers despite it being a hi-tea. Service is great with plates cleared quickly.will visit again very soon....highly recommend to everyone........
4
Carousel has always been our favourite place to eat buffet...varieties of foods and deserts...we really enjoy ourselves when we are there...n the staffs are very friendly...
5
Buffet had a wide spread of food. Seafood was fresh. The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly. The surprise birthday celebration for guests were well thought of. The staff even took our family photo which was nice!
5
Great spectrum of seafood for all seafood lovers, calms, oysters, lobsters and all. A good combi of Japanese, Chinese, Indian cuisine for all to pick
4
Celebrated my birthday with my family at carousel and am impressed by the large array of food the restaurant had to offer. The best sections would have to be the Indian section as well as the desserts. The sashimi and sushi section was slightly lacking as compared to other buffets but was well made up for by the other sections. Service staff are very attentive at clearing plates and topping up water.
5
I live around Basque people who have cooked me paella. The paella that I ate here cooked by Chef Robert was nothing but excellent. It was not only authentic but the flavor was spot on. I couldn't stop eating it and having the rest of my family try it. His trainee Joel made amazing lobster risotto. You can tell he was very passionate while preparing the cooked to order risotto. A bright future for this young chef. Overall, amazing experience only possible through passionate chefs like Robert and Joel.
3
They open sharp 2:30-5:30 pm for high tea. It's not enough time for chit chat and eat. HALAL restaurant with private room. Sashimi, oyster, prawn, sushi, Japanese salad, western salad, local food, Indian, indonesian, sandwich, dessert and chocolate fondue. Kueh pie ti is the best with thin and crispy skin.

The Hi Tea Buffet was awesome and value for money with a wide variety of dishes suitable for every taste buds. Been here quite a few years back but there have been a tremendous improvement since then. The mass birthday sing a-long was great idea by Carousel as it created a great atmosphere for everyone to participate.The staff were helpful, courteous and efficient. Keep up the standards especiallyon the quality of food and serving
5
I went to Carousel at 7:45pm for their famous buffet. The place did not disappoint!Delicious fresh sushi (tuna, swordfish, salmon, etc). Lots of different seafood (oysters, crawfish, shrimp, etc) available. Their Paella reminded me of Valencia (yummy). Good prime rib and their hot food was scrumptious. Not a huge desert table but who had room!High quality, Good service and a bit pricey but worth every Sing dollar
5
Was pleasantly satisfied with their service as well as their initiative to help us take a photo of us all in the complimentary birthday celebration they offered! Been with this restaurant for many years and their standard been high all along , I should say every visit I have been greeted with tremendously wonderful services and food quality ! Keep it up !
5
Have with carousel for many years, still in love with their dinner buffet. Words can't express how good it was until you have tried it. After tried so many international buffet, personally felt that carousel is the best overall and so much worth it.
4
We had a wonderful.lunch as usual and the most memorable touch that give us a lasting impression was the good gesture of the staff who presented my colleague with a farewell cake
5
We had a wonderful time. The food was awesome! I love the desserts. They surprise me with a birthday cake & photo taking. Outstanding service!!
5
Every year I make it a point to visit the restaurant and I enjoyed myself at every single visit. The standard has remained top notch! HIghly recommended!
4
I like the fresh seafood spread especially the sashimi, the mussels and crab. Others like the roast beef was good. the service was excellent too.
5
Out of all the halal hotel buffets I have tried, this is by far the best. Price may be a little steep for some but it is definitely worth the money. Excellent varieties, great quality.

First time to Carousel and I got to say I'm impressed.Impressed with the food quality and selections as well as the personalized services of the staff. As it was my friend's birthday, I have included a remark in the comment section when I made the reservation online.For other hotels/ restaurants I have been to previously , they would usually just surprise with a slice of cake and playing birthday song on CD . However, I'm amazed at the extra mile that the Carousel staff went .They stopped all that they are doing at the same time and gather in a circle only to sing birthday song and perform a dance for the birthday stars. It was really sweet and they went around to help to take photos of the birthday stars and even emailed us the pictures almost instantly. Can I add that they even took the trouble to decorate the picture with a frame!Not to mention the wide selection of food. Love their cold seafood section! Freshness and quality combined.The only downside for me would be the large crowd even on weekday nights, thus longer waiting time for certain queues as the food runs out quickly e.g. teppanyaki station.Overall, a good dining experience for a first-timer and I would definitely consider going back again for future buffet indulgence
4
I have been to this excellent buffet establishment several times already and I have been here for dinner every time since my last three visits to Singapore. Reservations is recommended as it is packed with patrons every evening. Just a great place to meet up with friends for a good meal
4
I've eaten hear about 5-6 times during my visit to Singapore, mainly because I stayed at Royal Palace and had a bunch of work meetings here. At first I really disliked this place. It was very expensive (e.g. appx $50pp for lunch buffet) and there was nothing special about it. Overtime though, I started to fall in love with the place. Something about the same staff that always smiles as you when you get there in the morning. The ambience music was also a nice touch. I was at first, disappointed with the selection. Nothing too special with it came to options. Bread, congee, noodles. Nothing I can't get across the street for $5, however. I finally gave each item a chance and realized why people love this place. With the simple/basic items, they do it very well. The soup was seasoned to perfection. Bread pudding, congee, ice cream, were all done consistently well
5
Visited 2 times so far. The spread of dishes is very impressive, and the seafood, fresh. Really enjoyed dining there. If you have specified that it is a birthday celebration, the staff will approach your table during your meal to sing the birthday-boy/girl a birthday song! Great service and food
5
3rd visit for hubby's bday. Best best best.. Hubby enjoyed the food being his 1st time trying.. Service was great.. Staff were friendly and polite.. Always been my favourite dining place.. for special occasions..
5
It's still amongst the best in Singapore. Range of food is good. Lots of 'happy' food (fantastic desserts) too. Very attentive staff. Keep it up!
5
They prepared a slice of cake for us as my wife any I are celebrating our wedding anniversary @ carousel. Photo taken by the service staff was emailed to me within the same day. Well done!!
5
Indeed the rave about Carousel is true. I am totally impressed with prompt and friendly service and the extended service to help celevrate birthdays with a slice of cake, birthday song to go with and photo taken for keepsake. For me food and dessert was awesome!! Nothing negative to me as first timers here
5
When I was pregnant, all I could think of was Carousel's seafood spread. Finally ate there last Saturday with my folks (visiting), husband, and kids. The seafood spread is still how I remember it to be... Great quality and variety. My craving for sashimi (and scallops and crab) was finally satisfied. We also enjoyed their desserts! I love love love their bread and butter pudding. The service is also good. We haven't been at Carousel for a while, so the singing of happy birthday was new to us. I thought it was a sweet gesture. What would've made it perfect is if celebrants could take home their cake (we were told it's not allowed). After indulging on so much food, my folks couldn't finish their birthday treat. But all good
5
We went there to celebrate the 4th anniversary of our business. The food spread is more sumptuous compared to Vienna in United Square - our usual hunt. It's very heart-warming to see the staff made extra effort to celebrate birthday for their customers. The atmosphere of such mass celebration was good, pleasant and happy. Surprisingly,they also presented us a cake with a candle to commemorate our anniversary. The staff generally are very friendly and attentive. They changed our plates quite frequent throughout our 2 hrs lunch there. I have sweet tooth and find their dessert not overpowering sweet like retails'.. just nice :) Would definitely come back again to dine in this restaurant
5
I brought my girlfriend to Carousel for a birthday lunch. The staff were very polite and prompt with their service. At one point of time, I was approached by a staff (Indian guy with spiky hair), who asked me if it was my girlfriend's birthday. He told me that there was a complimentary birthday cake slice and his team and himself would do a birthday song for her. I gladly agreed to it and it was certainly a pleasant and beautiful surprise. A gesture in which we really appreciated!The food was amazing. There was great variety and we ate to our hearts content. The food was also very fresh and well prepared. I would definitely love to visit this place again, maybe during the next occasion. This buffet is definitely among the best in Singapore. Highly recommended for everyone
5
I made the reservation online at 6:30pm yet I found myself couldnt reach the hotel before 7 so I sent an email (at 3-ish) to change the reservation time. Their staff replied promptly (within an hour) and confirmed the time change which I appreciate the most! The guy at reception was very polite and arranged the table near the window for me as I requested online. All of the staff were efficient and very polite. They even prepared a little birthday cake to my boyfriend. The oysters are very fresh and here were many different kinds of seafood. I will definitely come again next time I visit SG
5
Fresh seafoods..excellent staffs service. It was my 3rd time,and they've been consistent. The "duck salad" is exemptional!My husband was fully satisfied(his first time). He had fun when he was surprised with a mini birthday cake and the staffs gathered to sing a birthday song to all the celebrants
3
Great selection of cold seafood from crayfish, lobster, crabs to sashimi worthy of a 5 star hotel. What i loved best is the selection of oysters from Canada, France and USA. The only let down is the lack of hot dishes that stands out beside the usual hotel fare
5
The food is good and so is the services. The staff is friendly and very polite. I would plan to visit the place again.
4
There was a good spread of Chinese, Indian, Western cuisine and a genial atmosphere.
The service staff were good.
5
We enjoyed our time here very much, all food was extremely tasty and delicious. The atmosphere was busy but people here was polite and friendly. The price was not too expensive and worth for value.
5
Great food, great staff! Approached staff to coordinate a celebration for my parents wedding anniversay and they happily obliged! Siti was particularly helpful and pleasant. Loved the sashimi and cakes!
5
This place never disappoints. Anyone in the area should give this buffet a try. But try to make reservations fast because they get packed up real quick!
Best buffet ever!
5
I did a quick search about top 5 star buffet in Singapore & this was one of the top 5, from the pictures of fresh seafood i decided to go & i am glad i did, the quantity of the food is great from salads to desserts, quality & taste of food is wonderful, service is great & special thanks to Roberts who cooked a very delicious pasta for me, very friendly & has a very good knowledge of what he does
2
Let's face it the price is cheap for Singapore (60$ ++) but when you see what's on offer, you understand. I guess you can't have a lavish buffet for half the price of what the other restaurants offer but then maybe not going for a buffet is the best option. This one is nothing short of Sodexo type of food. It was a waste of time and a waste of money. Shame because the staff is really nice and friendly
5
Great selection of seafood, attentive waiter, especially the guy with two big earring that in-charge on my section (unable to get his name). big thumb up for his service!Buffet counter always crowded, but never empty as the chef topped up at reasonable timing. Definitely one of the best buffets in town that I had before
4
We are all crabs lovers, enjoying every moment of it! The sashimi was not bad and the desserts were plentiful with cakes and fruits.The staff's service is excellent, you can see that they are all very busy but they never fail to give you a smile wherever your eyes met theirs
5
Whenever i need to splurge big time on a Asian and Western meal...i would rather splurge my money here...They have a wide selection of seafood such as lobsters..oysters..which i see loads of people go there for...because they are truly fresh and always topped up by the staff there..there are Indian dishes..such as Briyani..Naan Bread...Kebabs..Chinese dishes... such as...Con-gee...Noodles in Soup...Chicken Rice..and Western dishes...such as..Roast..Pasta...Pizzas...that are all halal...And their deserts are absolutely delicious...i simply love their bread and butter pudding..then there is the chocolate fountain fondue corner...simply wowww!!..you wont regret spending your money here.
5
Great meal, excellent value. Had to remember to leave room for dessert. Very attentive staff wo cleared away used plates so professionally.
4
One of very few halal restaurants on town but selection of seafood is worth the price. For non seafood lovers, local food choices are somewhat limited. Deserts are below expectation.
2
Went with high expectations, but was quite an ordinary buffet, with a 5 star price.
No bacon?? Come on...
Pastries seemed old.
Glad I didn't sign up for it for every morning I stayed at the hotel (which was great)
3
I won't say it is great buffet food as buffet is rarely anything to shout about..
However, the dessert is good here. Very good selection and always need reservation.
5
My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by having lunch here (22nd March 2015) and we were seated at the Verandah section, where there was some privacy. As always, there was a sumptuous spread of culinary choices for every appetite and a delicious selection of desserts for the taking. We had indicated in our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary and was pleasantly surprised when one of the staff presented to us an anniversary cake and wished us Happy Anniversary :) They took photos of the occasion and e-mailed them too.I recall a few years ago at this very same restaurant, we celebrated our first month together. We didn't indicate in our reservation that it was a special occasion; however, one of the staff (an Indian man), approached our table and presented us with several heart-shaped chocolates and said "It seems that you are celebrating a special occasion". Earlier, I had presented a bouquet of roses to my partner and the staff must have observed us.We appreciate the effort from the staff to go the extra mile and make our experience truly a memorable one. Kudos to all the staff at Carousel; we will be sure to return
5
Great food, great staff, great ambience,Best place to celebrate any occasion or just feast your taste buds and then remember it forever. When you decide to have a buffet dinner you start to look for places with wide selections, good prices and easy access and we used to do the same and tried different restaurants around orchard,marina area and after every dinner we always end up saying ,errrr... we should have just gone to carousel. We have been dinning in carousel every now and then for the past 5-6 years and we always look forward to it every time. Highly recommend this plac
4
Wide selection of good food eventhough is just breakfast. The chef was professional in cooking up the yummy omelette. Besides local fruits, there are imported fruits served as well. Better make a reservation especially on weekends or public holidays. How I wish I have a bigger tummy to try all food served!
4
I personally feels that this is a bit overhyped. Visited on a normal Thursday afternoon and they were packed, so reservation is a must. Service is good, even called on the day itself to confirm your reservation. I would say the variety is good, but can't say the same of the taste of the food. Desserts, however, were very good. My favourite is crÃ¨me brulee. Would I go again? Maybe not so soon. Think I could probably do with some other buffets with perhaps a less hefty price tag
5
Celebrated my birthday dinner and what a surprised!! All staffs and chefs behind the counter joined in the fun to sing a birthday song to all birthday babies! It's a great place to celebrate birthday. The food spreads are awesome to the max! Good quality of premium foods. I love having the fresh seafoods! And of course, we love the desserts corner! Oh! That was so sinful indulging moments! Ambience and services, 2 THUMBS UP!Never regret once ever...... a place where I will love to pamper myself to the foods
5
We celebrated a birthday, carousel staff sang birthday songs to all guests that celebrated their birthday and gave them a slice of cake each. I felt thatit was a really nice touch. The service staff were really friendly and awesome! Even the chefs were friendly and chatting with the customers! There were a great variety of food, fresh seafood
4
Impressed with the entire process & experience from reservation till receiving the photos via email. Surprised with the thoughtful arrangement when they found out that the reservation is for some kind of celebration.
4
Good selection of food with great variety, best for business meal as the guest would have broad selections to suit individual taste. Nice ambient, centrally located in town. Good cuisine too.
4
Wonderful staff, birthday cake surprise and the food is simply good with large variety. If you had to treat someone to a really good meal, this is a place I would recommend. The variety of food is amazing.
3
Decent spread of food. Mainly local Singapore food.
Decent quality and good for a first time at the restaurant.
4
Good surroundings and great food. lots of Muslim friends can enjoy it too. a little pricey though.. can enjoy it once a while when your wallet permits.
4
I ate here twice, both with Muslim colleagues. And I am happy to say the quality and quantity were consistent both times. The buffet spread spans from Asian to International. Seafood like oysters are freshly shuck for you. And the desserts section was as impressive as well
5
everything is perfect for the restaurant except that i saw the food is readily opened and its for buffet just that some irresponsible customers just sneezed directly onto food. very unhygieneic of the customers. staff should learn to chase this type of customers away as they will be the cause of ruin to the restaurant reputation
4
They have really fresh seafood like prawn, lobster, oyster and many more! Love the prawn as they were all really fresh and sweet!!! There are so many choices of international cuisine that I didn't know where to start with. Spoilt for choices! Great food and ambience. They will even celebrate your birthday or anniversary with a special cupcake with lighted candle
4
The food has always been great. It is one of the best halal restaurant around. However it can get quite cramp when the restaurant is on a full house but it's not their fault when the crowd just keep coming. The seafood is super fresh and the desserts are wonderful. There is a lot of other options that ranges from western to Asian and Mediterranean food. Still one and will be my favourite restaurant although the price is on the steep side. As an alternative, try their weekend hightea and remember to make a reservation
3
The food is decent and the spread offers Infian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian and General seafood fare. For those having Muslims or vegetarians in their group this is ideal as the food is halal and there is vegetarian fare though not do much. There is a good array of desserts, but I would just concentrate on the sashimi and perhaps the bread pudding. It basically is an sll you can eat buffet at a hotel so go with an appetite. For dinner lobster is served! The high tea also offers a great range, mostly of local fare so for travelers who want to try out cuisine in one place.. This is a good place to start
4
Nice environment with good selection of seafood and delicious desserts. Really enjoyed the lobsters, prawns, crabs etc.
5
One restaurant you should not miss when in Singapore.
You get a mix spread of asian and continental cuisine. Sumptuous!
You just cant resist tasting everything that is laid out.
I definitely love the dessert.
5
Had been to this restaurant a few times and enjoyed the wide variety of food. Very fresh seafood, especially the different types of oysters from several countries. Great place for oyster lovers. Prompt, polite and excellent services from the staff too.
4
It was a weekend staycation for the family. The breakfast buffet spread more than met our expectations.
5
As suggested by the title, i was so impressed by the selection of seafood that was all i ate. The cold seafood that is.
5
i will definately go back again for other occasion becasue of the food & ambience & excellent service
5
The food spread is not bad & have high quality fresh food. It cost about $50 - $60 but it's worth the price as there are many many food over there.....Will visit there if there is a promotion Cleanliness: 9/10Staff: 9/10Food: 8/10Location: 9/1
5
The spread of dishes may not be as wide as some hotel buffets but the Carousel puts emphasis on the quality over quantity of food, and for me that defines a winner. Every single dish is delicious, but the best of all is the prawns cooked ala minute. Fresh and sweet and yummy down to last bite. If you are looking for value for money in a buffet, the Carousel should be on your short list. You need to decide and book early because I'm sure they can get fully booked very quickly
3
Super crowded on a weekday night, make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment. There were 3 of us and we were seated in the area where the windows faces the main road away from the buffet spread. In a way, it was fortunate as the main dining area was kind of noisy.Honestly, perhaps because of higher expectations from many good reviews online, this visit was a tat disappointing as the spread though good in variety, taste wise was just average. Found it a little too overrated in a way. I did enjoy the oysters and cheeses however. Just wanted to comment on the utensils used for the buffet which got me a little baffled (unsure if they were mixed up by the diners) big thongs were used for small items like cherry tomatoes ( i think a small spoon works better) while a big spoon used for lettuce which makes it hard to scoop. Desserts like cakes were served whole but cut into slices but the whole area became very messy, with smudges all over when the slices are removed using the cake spatula which can make it really unappetizing. I do not recall seeing such a mess at other buffets I had so believe the presentation can be further improved to create a better dining experience. Perhaps it was their high tea buffet that is much raved about, don't think I will try their dinner again though... If you are not fussy with taste and details like me, its quite value for money for the variety. PS: Carousel is one of the halal buffet in Singapore
5
Booking did away with the need to queue especially during the weekend. There were plenty of seafood. which are replenished very frequently. Our family love oyster, we queued up and ate our fill. the number of Oyster that we took paid for the cost of the dinner. Food were fresh. Staff are helpful and always ready to help.The salmon dish was nice so was the crabs and prawns. We hope to come again soon
3
Went there for a friend's event and was a little disappointed because the sushi wasn't very fresh. The stingray was good..and the self serve yogurt was good.. That's about it. .. i think The Line is better. ..
5
Carousel has always been my favourite international buffet restaurant for many years. My family love the spread and the freshness of their cold dish. We dine there regularly.
4
The Waiters/Waitress are very friendly and responsive
There is wide variety and selection of food;
Buffet is value for money.
Atmosphere of restaurant is very cosy and warm.
5
Well-balanced food range and value for money. Got senior citizen discount and 10%off from credit card promotions. Celebrated two birthdays there in 2014 and will celebrate this year's birthday again at Carousel.
5
The food is fresh and there are lots of varieties. I was there on a Saturday. I think they have extra seafood on Saturdays.
4
There is a wide selection of food, and the seafood section is pretty good. There are different shellfish, crayfish and the usual prawns, clams and sashimi. Not bad for a lunch buffet.Food is tasty and freshly prepared. Other than the ice-cream machine which broke down multiple times when I was there, the service and food left me with very good impression. I will definitely go back for more. Make reservations in advance because this place is always crowded
4
I have been to Carousel buffet, Royal Plaza on Scotts a few times already.I love the spread of the food there. Been with colleagues, we really eat to our hearts content. The spread is so wide that it is quite impossible to try everything. The seafood spread is good too. The food are fresh. I also love the chinese soup, duck salted vegetable soup. It's yummy. The indian spread is also worth trying. Not forgetting the desserts....... If you have a chance, you should give it a try. I will definitely go back again
4
Been here a couple on times. The last was 2 years ago & the recent was last week. The spread is still aplenty. The service is good. Most of my friends compliment on the laksa. It doesn't look fantastic but the taste is good. Overall the standard is still there
4
We had a Department meeting at the Hotel and lunch was at Carousel...Its spread of food was so overwhelming..Chinese, Malay, Indian, Japanese.. Fresh prawns, sashimi, cold crabs, salad and many more.....The dessert section are full of different variety of sweets stuff and fresh fuits, pastry and even fruit chocolate fondue. Yes, it's value for money. It's a halal restaurant, so everyone can enjoy the great food there.Excellent service and comfort place to dine.Location is good at Scotts road
2
I don't understand the hype about this place, but it could be due to my personal preferences and tastes. I personally feel this place is over-rated. There are many similar places with better services and better food, and I don't think I would prioritise this over them
4
One is spoilt for choice the second you enter the restaurant...the seadood variety is amazing and fresh.
4
A wide variety with fresh seafood. The whole atlantic salmon was fresh and juicy. If you fancy a quieter corner, can sit at the side nearer to the hotel entrance. It provides more privacy for a chat with friends and families.
4
Excellent buffet spread with fresh seafood and sashimi counters. Very popular with Muslims as it's one of the few higher end buffets offering Halal fare. Food is pretty good if you don't mind forking out about S$100 for dinner.
5
I have been patronising this retaurant for quite sometime. It's the best Halal Buffet ever in Singapore. The variation of cold seafood they have is a 'WOW'. I started eating and loving oyster here, in this restaurant. They served international buffet. So you can actually find Chinese, Malay, Indian, Japanese and Western Food. They have variant salad as well. The dessert is also superb. I loved the pudding and creme brulee much
5
It has been a while I last visited the buffet. But I remembered the spread was huge. Variety is also good. My family was celebrating my daughter's 21st birthday. We had a private room big enough to accommodate 14 pax. Service was good & they were helpful to take photos for my family. On the whole, it is worthwhile the price
5
My wife and I come here everytime we have a craving for western styled seafood! Ie, cold seafood platter.. No sauces, no seasoning.. Just pure fresh seafood! The selection of seafood here is fantastic! U can have lobsters, crabs, prawns, Alaskan crab claws even. They also have a good selection of international cuisine. The indian spread is also one of my favorites. To cap it off, one must leave some space for the desserts. They have a good selection of desserts and the Creme brulee is a must try! Great food, great staff.. But a tad expensive and reservations a must
4
In short, the food was excellent, with particular mention for the seafood spread that is easily better than any buffet lines in any luxury 5-star hotels in Singapore be it in terms of quality or variety.The cooked food sections were not far behind either, with deliciously rendered local and international delights. The downside though is that Carousel offers only a single sitting per evening, so reservations have to be made well in advance.The dining area is rather small and rather cramped/crowded for anything other than pure gastronomical pleasure. All in all, tops for food (quality, quantity and variety); A little wanting for ambiance. p/s: During my stay, the staff (service staff and chefs) will happily oblige with renditions of birthday songs for anyone having their celebration, if you are into that kind of thing
5
This is the most value for money buffet I have found in Singapore so far. They have quite a lot of varieties for you to choose from. The seafood and Japanese sections are nice. The dessert section is not bad too. They also have 10% discount with major credit cards. Make your reservation early as they are usually fully booked
4
My group of frens n i have been having our twice yearly hi-tea meet here since 1994. We find d location is centralise for everyone n gd ambiance. Food though there are some changes, they still served my fren favourite dessert, d bread pudding. Food varieties r gd nw
4
I've been here for buffet breakfast and lunch. I must say that the spread is a variety of tasty international dishes and they refill quite often. My personal favorite is the banana cake which is really moist and yummy! Watch out for the promotion of discounted room with free breakfast coz it's really worth the price
5
I have been to this place for a least 5 times or more . Company lunch to family / Friends eat out . a bit expensive but worth it
5
Excellent value for money place to celebrate special occasion with family and love ones.The food selection is awesome
4
Great high tea buffet spread. Every bite of it was sumptous and delicious and the dessert buffet was heavenly!!!...All in all..great food, great place and great service too!!
5
Carousel has a good buffet spread that caters to a variety of palates. The key thing is it serves Halal food and Muslim colleagues can join us in the buffet as well. I especially like the dessert spread.
4
The restaurant was full house but after explaining that its my birthday treat I managed to get my reservations for 2 pax.The restaurant even extended a small cute birthday cake for me and even take photos and send thru my email address. Really appreciated their gesture for the cake and to take our photos and send to me via email
4
Went there for lunch and high tea on two occasions. Never fail to disappoint us. The spread for both lunch and high tea are good. Good:1. Fast replenishing of dishes that are running out. 2. Waiters are fast at clearing the empty plates while you are on the move for more food. 3. Wide spread of international dishes such as sushi, laksa, bbq squid, roti prata, salads, cheese, seafood and etc. 4. Good spread of desserts that include 3 different types of fondue! 5. Friendly staffs (extremely important).To be improved:1. Price for high tea is a little on the high side, $89 for 2 pax after credit card discount. 2. Seafood spread for high tea not as good as lunch. 3. Maybe cut down a little on the deep fried dishes and have more baked or grilled items will be good. Overall is good but would advice to go for their lunch for first timers
5
Lots of variety! There are japanese cuisine, chinese food, western, and many many types of soups to choose!! I am a soup lover, and this is one of the best restaurant that serve many variety of soup!The special thing about this restaurant is that it is HALAL !Service is excellent, as the servers will not hesitate to clear your plates at all times!The price is abit expensive
5
Carousel has always been our top choice for buffet. Though costly, it is one of the best buffets in Singapore. This explains why it is usually fully booked for dinners on Fridays and Saturdays. There is a wide variety of food. Seafood is fresh, especially the oysters. It is also halal-certified
5
Best buffet in town!I love the Japanese Garlic Rice. Desserts are yummy - one can be spoilt for choice. A good choice in the sushi and seafood counter. A good place for family celebration and business discussion. Ambience is good, service is unsurpassed and staff friendly and accomodative. Food are fresh and replenishing keeps coming. Reservation is necessary as there is always a big crowd. I will strongly recommend this venue to all my friends and business associated
4
My lead had decided to throw me a farewell lunch at my previous company and of course, i decided to select Carousel.The dinner rate offered is rather high so the venue is best for special occasion for us, normal average humans. The selection of food is excellent and my personal favourite is the roast beef. The desserts are of a variety too. They also have a choc fountain for rose chocolate, green tea and dark chocolate.Honestly, the food is average for me. But for that special moments like birthday, it is kind of worth it
3
Food is so-so. Not too bad but prices have escalated. The spread is typically the same with practically no new add-ons.
5
Have been many times but every visit is a new experience. Menu changes often but thankfully service levels are consistently good. For business or leisure, nice environment and good food. Tip.. prebook your table to avoid disappointment. Has happened to me a couple of time.
4
Overall a very good dining experience. Celebrated my guy's birthday here and was surprised by birthday song sang by the staffs with birthday cake! Seafood variety was wide, big and fresh. Thumbs up.
5
Been coming here since i was a little girl. Fresh variety of food and great service! Will be coming again in the future!
4
Having visited most other brunch buffets around Singapore, I was surprised that I hadn't heard this one pop up amongst the expat community here. I had friends come to Singapore who were recommended this buffet so we booked. It's a no frills buffet with an abundance of freshseafood. Good value for money if that's what your interested in. I wouldn't go back again as I believe there are far better buffets around with a wider variety of dishes, and seafood offerings
2
Its one of those places you wonder why there's good reviews. We had the High Tea buffet. Food is at best mediocre. The local Rojak station has oxidized mango on display, so you can imagine. At the price they are charging, I would gladly spend more for better food quality elsewhere. If you are tourist who want to sample local delights, you get better dollar value and quality going to food courts or independent shops. If you like a nice afternoon tea in aircon environment, there's plenty of nice cafes or traditional ones to choose from.If you are into buffet, you gotta be willing to pay through the nose to get good quality stuff. Well of course, all depends what kind of traveller are you.Cheers

A bit over-rated. There is no question that the buffet spread was very good but it seemed to be quite crowded and the whole experience was very rushed. It was like trying to eat in a diner rather than a 5 star restaurant where they want to get you out as quickly as possible to turn the tables around. Unlikely to go there again
5
This is one of the few establishments that has a Halal Hi Tea. That being said, there is no compromise on quality or service. All my colleagues had a good time, a good meal and brought home good memories. Even though its a little pricey, the nice selection does more than make up for it. Overall, I'm very happy with Carousel

Make reservations is priority. The place is quickly filled up in the noon even for its high tea buffet. Offers a lot of variety so one can be sure to find something that suits one's palate. The seafood and sashimi are the favourite judging by the snaking queues. I only eat prawns and they were great! Chocolate fondue is also available with varieties of fruits to smear warm chocolate over with.I would suggest that one should try a piece of two of everything to have a feel of the overall food. Beverages are of great variety too. After a full stomach, one can make a cup of green tea without sugar to ease that bulge.Certain parts of the restaurant may be arctic cold as the air-conditioner is blasting away - wear a jacket if one is susceptible to cold. The service staff did not make an impression be it positive or negative, i think that is fine. It is better than having to deal with bad waiting staff who are pompous. And most importantly, it is Halal - so we can enjoy with our Muslims friends too

An overall good dining experience.Friendly staff especially Amal and Cat (hope I got the spelling correct).Booking thru online is quick and efficient.Staff will call 1 day prior to actual date for re-confirmation of slot.Visited on a Sunday with family to celebrate 2 birthdays. Pleasantly surprized with complimentary birthday cake and the restaurant even took a photo of our group and sent it to us via email for remembrance.Spread is good and fresh and offers a 10% discount for major Singapore credite cards. Would not hesitate to recommend this place to my friends and family

As the title says good food with great ambiance but pricey. But the location is great and very busy during the weekends. Avoid the weekends and try weekdays. It's a bit cheap during the weekdays.
5
The food here is amazing, the service top notch. Great selection of seafood.. and oh... the fondue.
This is a yearly celebration for my beloved sister birthday. Never dissapointed when am here
4
Great selection of dishes especially the seafood. All fresh and beautifully presented. Plenty of choices of other hot dishes. Especially liked the freshly cooked pasta.
Downside is a very limited drinks list. Also the place is very busy and noisy
5
Excellent taste with wide varities of choices. Celebrating my birthday at carousel. Staffs provide surprise celebration with me. Provide a memorable and enjoyable night. Highly recommended and will return for dining with or without celebration. Thank you so much. 😊

Hou hou, it is very nice restaurant, but at the TOP 5 restaurant at Singapore? I do not thing so... Food was tasty, lot of selection, but nothing special.
Desserts were little bit without taste.
You can try, but... Normal buffet restaurant
5
Excellent service, fresh seafood and awesome dessert spread! Love the birthday dance segment involving every staff :)
5
I celebrated my wife's birthday at the restaurant on 11th Mar 15. I've booked a reservations for 4 pax [high tea] a few days before and had a marvellous experience. The booking staff was very helpful and suggested a complimentary birthday cake to surprise my wife. I was really thrilled and delighted. I received a call again from the staff to confirm my booking. The high tea starts at 1530hrs. Upon arrival, we were greeted with warm smiles by the staffs. The buffet spread was awesome consisting of Asian and Western menus. The highlight of the day was the cute and lively dances by the staffs when they presented birthday cakes to all customers who were celebrating their birthdays. All in all, the awesome experience was unforgettable. Kudos to all staffs at Carousel!
5
Value for money with lots of choices. There are 6 types for just the cold seafood alone, not to mention that there are 2 types of oysters on top of it.The cooked food are good too and they refill fast. There are a few tables celebrating birthday, at 8pm the staffs came out to sing and dance, as well as giving you a small birthday cake.Overall their service are fast and nice. All waiters/waitresses are very friendly
5
What a treat .The variety and selection of food it amazing and good quality as well as being very tasty The service is fantastic as soon as you finish a course your plate is cleared and replaced The team is amazing especially Saravan and Reuben A nice touch that they do for people celebrating their birthdays Can't wait to come back
4
came here for a company dinner and was excited to dine in one of the good buffet (and halal) restaurants in SG. upon entering the restaurant, the staff greeted us with a smile and one of them accompanied us to our table. The place was not too big nor too small. The quantity and variety of food are equaled by the quality of taste. Make sure you prepare to taste every dish that they offer. DInner buffet costs $80 (Lunch $50+ and breakfast $30+). Even if the place was packed on a friday night, water glasses were filled and empty plates were cleared promptly. Great service overall
5
Food are great in quality and variety. Service is excellent, friendly and efficient. Overall great exp. Will come again
5
Wide varieties of delicious food to choose from. Staffs were polite and helpful. Had a wonderful time dining at Carousel.
4
Everyone talk about Carousel. So decided to give it a try. Me and my mom having our dinner for the first time. Its was the best buffet restaurant i ever been! 👏👏👏
5
Normally I go for steak or steak or if iam reckless its lobster ,I had lobster ,salmon prawns crayfish I think ,I loved it and it tasted so nice it was busy but not over busy ,friendly staff
5
Nice ambience with good service and friendly staff. Have many variety of food. Shashimi is fresh. Overall of food - Good
5
I had my birthday gathering with my family. staff are all very quick n efficient and they gave me a little surprise, we had a family pic taken by staff n was emailed to me in minutes. Good food variety and top it all excellent service. Kudos
4
Great food and plenty of it, not only seafood but all kinds. Very busy for a Monday night, so you need to book a table. It was very expensive for us and you must not forget that there is also a surcharge and tax added. The wine is also expensive. It was a great experience but would not go there again due to the cost
5
I have not been big fan of buffet restaurants in the past, mainly due to the quality of food on offer but Carousel is the exception. I really can't fault the quality or variety of food, especially the seafood selection which was very fresh and the choice of desserts.The service was also excellent. The waiters all appeared to be experienced, attentive and more mature. The plates were changed as soon as a round was finished and drinks served promptly.At $65 per head, it was reasonably priced. I would certainly recommend it to those visiting Singapore but you would need to book ahead especially for dinner
4
Our latest visit to Singapore had us stay at the Royal Plaza on Scotts which has the Carousel Restaurant. This restaurant has a nightly buffet which is fantastic, but not only according to us, but has we observed it has been awarded the best buffet in Singapore four at least 4 years running.It was very difficult to decide what to eat as the variety was endless, seafood - crabs, crayfish, salmon, prawns, mussels, oysters from around the world; Asian food of every description, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, Japanese, western food to suit every palate. Then there was the dessert menu that would really challenge the best sweet tooth.Although expensive it was well worth the experience
5
it was a very pleasant experience.it is not my 1st time here..tried the lunch,high tea,n dinner.although it has been 3 years since my last visit to carousel,they still never fail to maintain their high standard.i absolutely love the high tea dessert the most!the food is superb!and of course will come back to celebrate my events at carousel
4
Have long heard about the Carousel and finally made a reservation for my dad's birthday. It's really a good experience and have my family has an enjoyable time. Thank you to the staff for their awesome service!
5
Excellent service of all staff special mention Mr karlson who always go for extra mile to make my daughter birthday celebration a memorable one,
5
The staff were friendly and professional. The service was great. The food was awesome, wide variety & high quality. Even the birthday celebration was cute. It was always great to spend time and dine with family there. 5 thumbs up!
5
Celebrated our anniversary here. Enjoyed their spread. And was surprised when the staff came in with a special delicious cake for our anniversary. Very thoughtful and kind. Will definitely come back again. Foods were superbly SUPERB!
4
Great food, great service. All staffs are friendly and willing to attend your request with heart. Sure will coming back again.

Last night we had dinner for two at Carousel to celebrate a birthday. As usual, the restaurant met all our expectations. The staff were very attentive and cleared our plates as soon as we were done with each round, leaving our tables clean while we went to get more food. Food-wise, the seafood selection has definitely improved. Great variety of chilled crab, crayfish, clams, mussels and prawns. All seafood looked and tasted very fresh - this was my favorite part of the buffet
5
I just visited the Carousel, my second time. There are variety of food extravaganza. All their staffs are very courteous and helpful. They never looked tired in serving their customer. Even saw a waitress helping a customer to bring her plate to the table. Being my son's birthday, we were surprised by a cake and birthday song. We were very delighted. It may be happen in other restaurants but beyond expectations, the manager even took a family pic of us and emailed me, even before I reached home. The manager is doing a great job with a wonderful team. I definitely will recommend Carousel to all for a great gathering.

Strange heading for really a very good amount of food on this buffet..There was just something that I can't put my finger on that didnt grab me..Lack of atmosphere? heaps of people casually dressed, shovelling in copious amounts of messy seafood.? I dont know..I read the reviews and had booked months previously, and because it was rated number 1, I expected more.. I personally dont enjoy having to fight for my dinner ( getting flesh out of legs, peeling shells off prawns etc) so I headed for the other food but not much really grabbed by attention..It wasn't bad, but nothing excited me..My husband felt the same..We were in and out within the hour. I enjoyed this place better at breakfast time..The place felt abit like a barn full of plastic chairs, no elegance to it.. But hey! each to there own..We had travelled to Singapore to celebrate my husbands retirement ( and had informed the hotel and restaurant that) so a small acknowledgement of that occassion would of been nice..Its not the cheapest place in town..but seemed like a food hall.Staff lovely and friendly though
5
Carousel has long been my favourite restaurant in Singapore because of the excellent quality of food and choice of food types. Although it is buffet style the chefs are there in sight constantly replenishing. The staff are happy and eager to deal with any requests. You will need to book well in advance because of its popularity for lunch and high tea, but especially so for dinner. We are booked for a birthday meal again this weekend because we know we will not be disappointed with the food
5
I have always regarded Carousel as the best halal (classy) restaurant in Singapore. Over the years, the food quality and standards have been well maintained and the staff is friendly as always. As such, I decided to take my girlfriend there for our anniversary celebrations. They responded to our request of being put at the corner of the restaurant - where it is less crowded/more private. Although, the whole setting was not very romantic as there are many people around and it gets a bit loud sometimes - but we didn't really mind. To top it off, they gave us a cute little slice of cake with a candle, took a picture of us and sent me a follow up email congratulating us on our anniversary - this is what I call good service!Where food is concerned, if you love seafood as a cold dish, then this is the perfect place to go. I especially love the array of oysters and crayfish/giant prawns to choose from. But overall, Carousel is also known best for its desserts. I have lost count of how many creme brule's I have consumed from this establishment.Thanks Carousel

Fantastic food Great location lovely staff..
I can see why this buffet is rated " the best buffet in singapore"
A must if you are staying in this hotel or not..
Very highly recommended
5
I have been dining at Carousel for a few years and it never fail to amaze me on the sumptuous spread of Eastern and Western cuisine. I always target the fresh seafood and the dessert. The crew is very approachable and friendly. I even held my wedding buffet dinner over there. A note to those who interested to dine at Carousel, do make your reservation at least 2-3 weeks prior to your plans to avoid disappointment. If you still considering, Carousel was voted the best buffet restaurant in Singapore for 5 consecutive year in 2014
5
Booked for 9 pax for company reunion lunch, with 2 colleagues having their birthday. Very pleased with the service of staff willing to go extra mile to make their day special by giving cakes with candles. Really appreciate the kind gesture to me and my colleagues. Will definitely go there again
5
My sister-in-law is a Singapore citizen and since she knows that we are fond of buffets, she treated us for lunch here at Carousel Restaurant located at the ground floor of Royal Plaza on Scotts. The foods in the long buffet tabke were international cuisine. There were a lot to choice from and one cannot eat all of what is being offered in this buffet restaurant. The food are mouthwatering and deliciously tasting. No wonder the restaurant is full and popular buffet restaurant in SG. Just a tip, make sure to make a reservation if you wish to dine there because if not, you'll just waste your time if you go try to go there without making one because I've heard its always full of people and from my personal experience dining in the place, yes, it is really a hit and all seats were occupied with guests.
5
We made a reservation for high tea buffet... I was pretty amazed by the food varieties for high tea buffet... Didn't really expect much for high tea but it turn out to be better than expected... We would definitely visit again for their lunch or dinner buffet... It was also a wonderful experience celebrating my friend's Birthday @ Carousel... Thank you all the Carousel crew for the great Birthday performance... Thank you very much..
5
Situated at Royal Plaza Hotel, Carousel has always been quite a popular hotel buffet restaurant among locals and foreigners, especially since it is halal. The restaurant is renowned for its sumptuous Asian and Mediterranean buffets, served in an elegant ambiance. it serves a huge variety of cuisines, featuring a variety of sweet treats with not one but three dessert counters. Special mention must be made of its bread & butter pudding and Asian selections. I enjoyed the new Teriyaki counter where you can have Japanese style fried rice, chicken, seafood and beansprouts on a single plate, all cooked lived in front of you. Excellent customer Service, especially in terms of clearing plates and refilling of water. Loved the buffet highly recommended the treat
5
Singapore buffets have to be the best in the world and this was the best I had in Singapore. Such a variety of food and everything was delicious and fresh. Started with the seafood, as you do, and the only one that not as good as I thought it would be was the Maine Lobster. The rest delicious. And tried things I had never had before in the clam and seashell range. Then went to sushi and a small selection of the hot meals. By this time only had a enough room for a small selection of deserts. The service was friendly and prompt. It was a little crowded but it was a buffet after all. The chefs behind the stations were helpful and excellent. Loved the birthday cakes and the staff singing happy birthday
5
Every time I come to Singapore I make a quick beeline for this buffet . Its fresh its varied and its really good. Its well patronised so there is plenty to choose from . Everything is well displayed and the presentation is excellent . You can get just about everything here and the seafood is especially good. They do good straits , malaccan , chinese , malaysian and indonesian dishes as well as Indian . I love love love love this buffet ....
4
This is one of the best hotel buffet i've had in Singapore so far. They have wide range of food selections from eastern to western. Seafood is definitely one of the all time favorate, and the seafood here are really fresh. Even the dessert will never let you down. I like the mango yogurt. Another highlight is the staff. They are all friendly and willing to attend your request with heart. Nowadays it is difficult to find a restaurant in Singapore with this service standard, especially in a buffet place with so many tables and customer
5
Everything was good! From the sashimi to cold platter, cooked food and desserts. Every dish was very tasty. Service was good. Worth every penny paid.U know how some buffets are only good for certain type of food. Carousel was an all rounder!Will definitely go back again
5
I've always been coming back here for special occasions and their food choices and varieties never disappoint.The best one would be their seafood options - fresh and delicious.
4
I will definitely recommend families and friends to have a go for buffet at Carousel coz I will definitely go back again..wide spread of food varieties and spoilt for choices.
5
I'll definitely visit again! (: Great food plus a great service. :D So far the BEST halal buffet! Thank you for making my Mother's birthday a memorable one! We'll come back for Dinner buffet soon! 😍👍
5
Very happy with the food and staff. They go the extra mile in celebrating my sister's birthday singing a birthday song and giving her a birthday cake. We are all very touched by this gesture. Keep up the good service.
4
Really love the seafood FRESH indeed and first of all, it's HALAL....we will come back again soon :)!!
5
I like everything as there are choices for everyone"s taste buds. Also the service both table and behind the counter chefs is always ready to serve one's needs. Best breakfast and dinner buffet I would highly recommend
5
We have always chose Carousel for our celebration eat out.. be it for anniversary or birthday celebration.. had a good experience dining with sumptuous spread of food and friendly staff.. will definitely come again for our coming celebration and will recommend this place to my friends.. families and relatives..

There are a variety of buffets in Singapore. In Carousel, they have good choices of seafood, western and local food. When compared with other buffet restaurants in Singapore for sure it is one of the best. It is also very convenient for tourists who stay in Orchard.It's always popular and quite crowded and you have to be careful when you're taking the food back to your seat! :
5
My extended family of 21 adults, 3 kids and 3 toddlers celebrated an early Chinese New Year reunion and all of us enjoyed the vast spread of fresh seafood. Special mention must be made for the "live prawn" cooking station, though you've got to be quick as the food is only cooked in small batches. The Indian food station seemed to be the next popular choice - the naan was memorable. The soups were great and tastes like there was much thought into it (both the broths and creamy soups). The dessert station featured 3 different fondants! (strawberry, chocolate and green tea!) The cakes were good, though the ice-cream was more popular. Best of all was the impeccable service. Danny and Lily were so prompt and accommodating in the seating arrangements (making sure EVERY SINGLE guest was comfortably spaced and seated), getting the "surprise" cake for a wedding anniversary and birthday that was concurrently celebrated, and the efficient clearing of plates and topping up of water. One drawback is the rather short lunch service (only from 12pm to 2pm). One of the most professional restaurant service I've come across. My family and I look forward to returning soon
5
Carousel never fails to make our visit an unforgettable one.Especially with all the variety of food that you can get.My hubby absolutely loved your seafood section.He could eat all the crabs and lobster that his tummy could fill.Not to mention the GREAT service from their staffs on duty that day.But I'm sure all the staffs' service standard are impeccable.Will be coming back for another memorable date soon.:
5
Loved the choice of breakfast food. A very nice lady asked me to try the noodles, it was fantastic although not a typical western breakfast choice.
5
tonight the first time I came here .... Nice and fresh seafood I ever eat....!!! For seafood lover : you have visit this place ... Very recommended!
5
i love everything! sometimes i don't even know what to eat, but it's a bit pricey so i only dine here during special occasions :)
4
Went here for high tea. Staff were friendly. A+ for service. A wide spread of variety. Would love to come here again but too expensive for a buffet.
4
I was here with my colleagues for lunch, they have wide ranges of selections. Including seafood, desserts. Their herbal soup was really worth to try it and it always run out fast. The service is good and the location is quite convenient.
5
I came to dine in for my fiance's surprise birthday dinner.Nvr seen him so happy n comfortable before,best ever birthday celebration for him.The staffs are customer oriented,making sure everything is in their good hands.Rest assured we will come again to enjoy e gd food..thk u so much for making it happen, good job guys!
5
We heard a lot about the food at the Carousel Buffet and we were not disappointed. The dinner buffet had a seafood theme and the excellent variety and taste was matched by the excellent service provided by the team at Carousel. Well done and we hope to be back in the future

Got invited by my brother boss for their company gathering. The ambience of the restaurant is cosy, set up is nice, aircon not too cold. As for the buffet, nothing to shout about, all very normal, cold seafood spread have lobster, crab, prawns. Lobster was good, crab not much meat, prawns not to bad but the meat stick onto the shell. Some of the Oyster plump & creamy, prawn noodles was served that night but too much sugar in the soup. Fish maw soup was the winner, thick & flavorful with many ingredients, finished fast. Poached salmon have fishy smell not appertising. Dessert spreads was ok.
5
If you are dying to reward yourself, go to Carousel Buffet at 25 Scotts Road. This cafe is within the Royal Plaza on Scotts Hotel and it offers big spread of food as a halal venue. Quality is also not compromise and selection of appetisers and desserts are enough to make you skip the main hot meals. It has seafood, international selection, as well as western and local dessert section to boast. Give yourself that well deserved treat
5
I have not been to Carousel for dinner for a good number of years. Some things have changed; the presentation of food, the removal of less used fruit juice counter with a Teppenyaki one, the arrangement of tables and chairs and lighting and fixtures. While others remain the same; professionalism of the staff, the quality of food, the touch of class and the extra mile to make an average day a special one. I came here for my birthday as a treat from my wife. As summarized above, i would not hesitate to visit here at the drop of a hat as a must eat place since i first visited the humble place nearly 15 years ago. Thanks for going the extra mile with the cake and the photograph which was a surprise! My one and only gripe was that the dessert section could have had a wee bit more stuff though. A suggestion that could help improve the ambience would be to place diners who are served alcohol to be placed at a section as sometimes guests who have had just a wee bit too much could give kids the jitters. Cheers
5
Celebrated my Mum's birthday. They gave a complimentary birthday cake and the team sang a birthday song.
It was a great experience overall. From the moment we entered. Great smiles and friendly staff.
Great job to the team.
5
Great variety, there's something for everyone. :) Seafood, sashimi, desserts, 3 fondues, many international dishes. Came here for my mom's birthday and they had a complimentary cake too.
5
Enough said.... The best place for buffet where the food is of the utmost standard.. Must Try
Cold Serve Seafood
Bread Pudding
Teppanyaki
Roast Lamb Leg
And even the hot drink dispenser Hot chocolate
And much much more
1
Loved the buffet. Always fresh and plentiful. The custom made omelettes are lovely. One of the highlights of our trip.
5
Service was really good. One of the staffs were very attentive and constantly checked on us whether we were Satisfied with the food and service. The staff gave a brilliant orientation brief upon ushering us to our table. Great job, Carousel!
5
Amazing menu with great selection of really tasty food. good customer service and overall a satisfied customer! recommended for anyone who loves food!
5
Even though its only for High Tea, food was excellent in terms of quality and quality... definitely value for money meal !!!Loved the seafood section with the lobster claws and the salmon sashimi was generous and great! The fish maw soup was really yummilicous and ... the nasi lemak although a simple dish has great condiments such as beef rendang, crispy peanuts & ikan bilis, sambal quail eggs, achar...yum yum... here are some of the dishes i had:- Pathai kway teow, Pan Fried crispy carrot cake, kway pie tee, sotong panggang, tauhu telur, prawn cucur, patota shrimps and many more... wished i had a bigger tummy....Before i forget... great to meet up with ever friendly Kalson...he does Carousel proud!!
5
I was surprised by the soup variety as I'm a soup person and looking forward some soup on that day. Hence, they have quite a few soup selections! Awesome! And also I lovvveeee the cheese section. Service was great too!!! Also it's my bf's birthday and they gave a small slice of cake with music and also some chef came out to celebrate together too
5
We had the pleasure of eating here and cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant! Firstly we were greeted by the lovely and very professional manager Lin. She was excellent in taking care of our questions and general care. The rest of the staff are very efficient and quietly providing an excellent service. The food was varied and hot/cold as required and constantly plentiful. We will be back when we go back to Singapore for a holiday
4
Always make a point to come here for our Anniversary. Went to online and realized it was booked. But when I called reservation team made effort to make my booking. Thank you for that. A nice touch was the Anniversary slice of cake. It was served later with the birthday group. Thumbs up!....and finally the photo taking and emailing to us...Double thumbs up! Oh yeah...the food still superb....
5
buffet is among the best in terms of quality and variety. I enjoyed tall japanese dishes. But I 've seen that western and indian specilaities were higly appreciated. Excellent service also for late arrival. I'll return surely to taste their specialties...
5
Once again this place never fails...great food..ambience...fit for all occasions...great service...great for having a family or friends get together
2
We went to book and asked for a look. We didn't book. We were concerned that there was little regard for ensuring that good food service hygiene standards were being maintained. When patrons can breathe all over everything it is a worry. Some dishes appeared to have inadequate heating and cooling as required. Noisy and crowded seating. No table service for food.Maybe buffets are just not for us!!!
5
visited on 12 Jan 2015 for high tea buffet for birthday celebration for my friend.Group of staff sing her a birthday and gave a cake and take photo.Photo will emailed to me same day. I will impressed and will definitely visit again.I love the wide buffet spread and it taste goodfriendly staffnear to orchard reasonable pricin

We made reservations for 7 at the Carousel which is a buffet place on the ground floor of the Hotel Royal Plaza on Scotts. Parking was convenient at the building next to it and we took a short walk to the Royal Plaza. The hotel itself is impressive, boasting a large double stairway that meanders onto the Lobby, as you enter through the main doors.We arrived at around 12 just as the buffet was about to open. We were escorted to our table by a waitress who took then took our drink orders. The restaurant is large and well spaced out. We started with the appetizers and soup. There is a good selection of breads and Foreign cheese. Overall, the main stations were salad and sea food, (Lots of variety including mussels, crab, salmon which was to die for), Chinese, where you could order fresh made noodles which the Chefs prepare it as you watch. You just point to the condiments and ingredients. I tried the Western section where they serve roast turkey (or was it chicken), sirloin and Yorkshire pudding. I was not very impressed with the variety which certainly was lacking. I was hoping to see a few more entries in the area. Nevertheless, you won't go hungry as other stations certainly made up for it. There is also an Indian corner where they serve the popular Indian dishes - Dessert was good with lots of variety, including the one of the best CrÃ¨me brulee I have ever had. I ended up eating 6 though the ramekins were small in size.I noticed several exquisite coffee machines where you help yourself to several kinds of coffee and Chinese teas. Service was good and very attentive. Waiters were quick to clear any left overs and used plates within seconds. Though this place is not cheap it worth trying at least once when you visit Singapore. Also, be sure to call up and make reservations in advance. This place is always booked in advance.Overall, a pleasant experience and probably the only Halal Buffet Restaurant of this level in Singapore
5
I planned a birthday surprise dinner and it all went well. We were lucky to arrive early as there was a long queue behind us. Even though it is quite expensive, i thought it'll be worth the try after reading or hearing good reviews about Carousel Buffet. My partner was surprised with the service they provide, such as singing birthday songs to those that are celebrating it on that day. The staff were so attentive. They also took our photos and got it email to our account, which i thought was beyond what was expected.The food spread was fairly amazing. We loved the "sotong sambal" and the cheesecake! The best for me was the honeydew(lol) it was refreshing and well...sweet enough. However, i just think that its too crowded for a romantic occasion. I just feel that the seatings could be improved as it just gave me the feeling of being in a fast food restaurant. In all, i would return there some other time all because of their service
4
The breakfast buffet at Carousel was very good. They basically had 3 food stations; the fruits & salad station, the continental station and Asian station. The spread in all the stations was aplenty that one could not ask for more.The continental station had nice hot waffles, pancakes and freshly made eggs in any manner you may ask from omelette to scrambled made by the chef. The Asian station served porridge to noodle soup made by the chef. There were also the usual nasi lemak, dim sums and roti canai. The fruit and salad station also served all types of fruits, cold cuts and salad.I especially liked the espresso machine which served lattes and other types of coffee.One could eat to your heart's content at Carousel's Breakfast Buffet and would not go hungry all day after having breakfast here. Two thumbs up
5
To start with, the food spread was really quite impressive and having starved myself the whole day, I couldn't wait to dig in. But apart from the food, the service was really quite something. From booking the table, to dining at the restaurant and even after the dinner, Carousel made sure we got the best service
4
Whilst staying at the Royal Plaza hotel my friends and I chose to dine at the Carousel Buffet. At S$80 per person it isn't a cheap option but we've heard many good things about it so we thought we'd better try it whilst there.The atmosphere is not the best, feeling like a canteen with many seating options and a hustle and bustle. However the staff are very attentive and friendly and the sheer abundance of excellent tasting food makes up for the lack of atmosphere.There is a seafood section with giant crabs, salmon, oysters, scallops, prawns, Sushi and Sashimi, choices of Indian meals, western foods (pastas and anti pasti), pepper crab dishes and many more....then also large desert section. One can easily eat for 2 hours.A good choice to eat when hungry and after very good tasting food
5
Its a high end buffet so naturally prices are also a bit expensive.Food is nothing short on spectacular, good variety of most general cuisine.Do make reservations because its always almost packed every night.My only gripe is they sing to the birthday boy/girl...and expect that to be repeated numerously throughout the night.Other than that, solid food, great dessert, chill vibes. Also Halal certified
4
Pricey. Nice decor. Many varieties. Especially like the Thai BBQ Beef. We were 10 min early and was not allowed to go in. Can't they let us wait inside?
3
Good choice of food and the selections were well stocked during the buffet time. My only criticism here would be the noise level, not pleasant if you want to talk while dining here.
4
Whenever it comes to High Tea, the first choice would be Carousel. They have wonderful wide spread of variety on their buffet line that would definitely wet your appetite. Over the years they have definitely improved their layout and menu. Service is also tip top.
4
I recommend this place if you are gathering with families, friends and associates with diverse food interest. From vegetarian, Indian, halal, Chinese, western to seafood, there's something for everyone. And for the price, I think the food offers great value ( was there for lunch). I love most of it, the cooked food is delicious to me, the sashimi and seafood are decently fresh. Most importantly, I had a great time as well with the dessert spread! Not bad at all! Go with some friends and enjoy an afternoon chatting and savouring the spread

We were staying at Royal Plaza & heard about the famous buffet.We booked for dinner ($80 Singapore pp) and in truth when we were shown to our table we had second thoughts 0 it's like eating in a food hall. But were quickly changed our minds when we saw the quality & range of food. An EXCELLENT meal & very friendly efficient service. Alcohol was VERY expensive - so we dined with water. But Carousel is definitely value for money
5
We celebrated the dinner party of the New Year 2015. Included drink and food we spent 180 euro for 2 people. It s really cheap considering the huge amount of fresh oysters, lobsters and many more shellfishes available. I tried also asian food and in partcular indian was very high quality. Food is unlimited you can eat as much as you want. Desserts and cakes were high quality too. One of the best buffet in the world i really suggest you to try it!

I was here for HIgh Tea for our annual year end get together. Am surprised to see this full house. So many choices that I didn't get to try every item offered. I like their open kitchen concept, so you get to see your food freshly prepared in front of you

I am SHOCKED that this place has good reviews. It is wildly over priced (USD$80 per person) doesn't include alcohol (which is also wildly overpriced) and the food is TERRIBLE. I really truly feel confused. I cannot see how anyone could ever think this was an excellent restaurant in any way. I actually started looking at the reviewers profiles and noticed that most of them only had carousel as their only review. I knew roughly how much it would cost, but I had been to several really upscale buffets in Las Vegas where they serve Filet Mignon and lobster, and all of your drinks are included. This place had a carved beef that was cold (even though it was carved in front of me) a seafood display that looked like it had been frozen and put out to thaw. I dont really know what to say other than please dont go to this place, the whole experience ruined one of our few nights in Singapore. I really wish that someone had warned us

Is my first time to Carousal. All the staffs are so friendly and helpful. The approach by the recep, the serving by the waiter and waitresses are all well presented. The request that I've made, were all done up so perfectly.. The variety of food was so much that I don't know what to start with. Dessert was nice. Will definitely visit again.. Cheers.

We had dinner here with friends. We all agreed the decor and layout is a bit foodhall style.The food is to die for and the service is excellent too. It is more expensive than your average restaurant but well worth the investment if you enjoy good foo
5
Great food and great service. It was worth the money. They have it all: sushi, Chinese, Mediterranean, salad, tapas, seafood, ice cream, chocolate fountain, tons of deserts and even an expression machine.
4
The desserts need improvements, should have more selection. Other than these, the ingredients were fresh. The seafood available there had me going back for more. . Reservations preferablely should be made beforehand. Good selection of food
5
We are frequent customer to Carousel Hi Tea Buffet and its wide spread and Halal buffet is rare in Singapore. Its food and spread is above the rest of the Halal buffet in Singapore. Its desert ......yummy!
5
Excellent service and staff are willingly to help and prompt service at any given time. Food was lovely and a wide variety. The dessert are mouth watering, The atmosphere is marvellous.
5
Great food, large area, good selection Asian and Western - Asian foods were great. Clean, neat tidy.
The staff are great, always helpful, and friendly.
4
Good Food always crowded. They have won awards fot their buffets. they offer special discounts on some credit cards.
5
One of the best seafood spreads I have ever seen! It was simply outstanding, a one of a kind extravaganza that is a must for all food lovers. Best and freshest seafood possible, great variety of international and asian dishes and all with a friendly smile. Highly recommendable and worth every cent
5
I had a wonderful time at the Carousel High Tea Buffet on 4 January 2015. I had planned a surprise birthday for one of my sisters and we had very good service from the staff. We were given a private room with very attentive staff throughout the time we were there. The food is also good - with escargot, crab, sushi and a wide variety of local and international fare. The wait staff were very attentive and came into the room regularly to clear used plates. Overall, I would recommend this venue for medium group intimate gathering. Well done, staff of Carousel
5
Fantastic way to start the New Year. Service with a smile. Took the extra mile to note of the guest celebrating birthday. Quick to acknowledge patrons. Beautiful selection of food from the cold cuts to the hearty filled dishes. Meal fit for a king and Queen and definitely a royal treatment. Thumbs up Carousel team. Thank you for the great high tea and non judgemental treatment. Definite reason to return
4
Had Christmas dinner to celebrate my parent's anniversary. There was quite a wide spread of good food including festive choices and not to forget desserts! Their best ever bread pudding is still the best! Been there for lunches and hi-teas but the price you paid for dinner is definitely worth it! Ambience was quite relaxed even though it was a full house that day. We were also surprised with a complimentary slice of celebration cake, x'mas dance performance by staffs and Santa giving out treats to the kids. You will be spoilt for choice - that's for sure and to highlight, the cold cuts were very fresh! Two thumbs up for their speedy services and hospitality
4
We went to Carousel and had one of the best buffet lunches. Celebrated Xmas and my nephew's birthday today.Price was reasonable, for the fantastic spread of international cuisine. I will definitely patronise Carousel again. Service was good, All in all a very memorable dining experience.
5
Carousel's High Tea Buffet certainly lives up to its hype. An excellent spread that is matched by stellar service. Apart from the mutton kheema which was a tad saltish, most of the food we tasted was excellent. We had a triple birthday celebration, and although the restaurant was packed we felt like we had our very own team of service staff looking after us. Kudos to Mathi, Mega, Lin,Cecilia and Adrian. We will definitely be back! Thank you again Team Carousel for an excellent afternoon
5
We had Christmas lunch here and there was just to much to chose from! Sushi, Seafood, Salad Bar, Carvery, Indian, Desserts as far as the eye can see and cheese selection. The service was impeccable, though drinks are extremely expensive & not included in the price. The only thing I didn't like was the lobster bisque, however it was my first ever tasting, so unsure what to expect. Highly recommend for a special occasion
4
Was there for dinner Buffet. They have wide range of variety international spread. Wide lovely spread for seafood and dessert lovers. Pasta was fabulous too! They have a birthday song sang by all the service staff and chefs at the buffet area and a slice of rainbow cake was presented to all ppl celebrating bday. Hence was a happy occasion to be at. Service was very good too. Plates will cleared timely. Bid goodbye too when walked out of carouse

We initially wanted to have the buffet in Nov, but it was fully booked so we had to change it to Dec instead. Location was good, 5 minute walk from Orchard MRT if traveling via train, but there is a short stretch of road that is not sheltered.Buffet started at 630, and they had a hook under the table for hanging small bags. Service was good, with attentive staff filling up our water glasses and clearing our tables of the empty plates at regular intervals. A small bowl of water was also provided once we were seated at our table (for washing).Wide variety of food; we tried the various cold seafoods, sashimi, mediterranian, chinese, indian, pasta, cheese, fondue and ice cream, yoghurt, and the cake station. The alaskan crab legs and prawns were fresh and sweet, oysters were nicer if you have them at the start of the buffet, crayfish was ok, sashimi can be skipped. There were several whole cooked fishes - the whole salmon was ok, salmon in dill fish sauce was slightly dry, chinese-style was my favourite. Advisable to try the fishes at the beginning as they get mangled after awhile.The fried rice was slightly sticky but tastes ok. The baby bok choy was fresh, sweet and crispy. The chicken chop was sweet. Biryani was not bad when taken with the mutton curry. Had a cream penne at the pasta station with bacon bits, which was not bad. We wanted to avoid the embarrassing singing that the restaurant staff does during a birthday celebration in certain restaurants, so we opted to not check the "Birthday/ Anniversary" option in our reservation form. It turned out to be a general mass singing session for all patrons in the restaurant, with dimmed lights and a birthday song playing over the speakers, and the birthday boy/girl or couple was served with a cake. Staff was also more than happy to help with the photo-taking, and it could be an interesting (and not too embarrassing) experience for those involved. There were three flavors for the fondues, including chocolate, strawberry and green tea. Chocolate is as usual, while the strawberry and green tea had a slightly artificial taste to it. There was a small selection of fruits (strawberry, honeydew), sweets (marshmallows), churros and some other food items at the fondue station. Three types of ice cream next to the fondues, basically vanilla, chocolate and strawberry; you could have it in a bowl with a biscuit or with a cone. The yoghurt station is next to the cheese station and there was only one flavor available - mango. Several bowls of 'add-on' food items were provided next to the yoghurt machine, i.e. raisins, cornflakes, cheerios, etc. We also tried the bread and butter pudding (normal), creme brulee (ok), lemon meringue (nice), cheesecake (normal), chocolate mousse (not bad), some other cakes which were so-so. The hot drinks station was the normal Nespresso/ Nescafe machine, with espresso, cappuccino, latte, mocha, hot chocolate. Mocha was the nicest, the other coffees had an artificial taste and the hot chocolate was diluted. Water was FOC, but staff mentioned that other (cold) beverages will be charged accordingly.The buffet cost (per pax) was somewhat steep, but it was ok considering the selection of food and the service provided. Overall a satisfying experience
4
The buffet spread has good variety and is satisfying. Their refill is fast but always seem to run out quickly to fast hands too (in our case, the fresh prawns and ice cream). High-tea ends at 5.30pm but when we headed for the vanilla ice cream at 5pm, it has ran out with no signs of refill. Overall, experience is always wonderful. It was my husband's birthday - Carousel sang a song and offered a complimentary cake - it was really sweet of them. Do take note to book at least 2 months in advance
5
Lots of food, seafood, Chinese, japan, cakes, dessert. Tasty. Enjoyable ambiance. But.. not very much variety of drink and juices.Clean, lots of utensils and plate. Never run out.They have babychair too.Still, great staff. They check your booking correctly and fast. They really help out.Fast food refill
5
I have been a patron of Carousel since its early days as Cafe Vienna. The restaurant has always surpassed my expectations. My most recent visit was on 20 Dec 2014 for a family birthday celebration. As always, the buffet spread was comprehensive, delicious and of very high quality, and service was warm, attentive and prompt. Three slices of cakes were delivered to the birthday girls at our table, complete with Carousel's signature celebratory song by the staff. It was very lovely. Thank you again, Carousel, for making our dining experience a memorable one

If you are intending to dine at Carousel during December, it is a must to make advance booking.I wanted to celebrate my Hubby's birthday there last year but was surprise that the whole month of December was fully booked even though it's only early Nov. So this year, I make the booking via email 3 months before his birthday.When we seated at our table, the staff came over to me and whisper if I'm celebrating my hubby's birthday. They told me they will bring out a birthday cake at 8pm. So 8pm came, the restaurant light were dimmed and they played Happy Birthday song with the staff clapping and hubby was served a birthday cake with a candle lighted. Well, it's not just for my hubby though. It's for everyone who is celebrating their birthday too.What I'm surprised is they actually remember that I mentioned it was my hubby's birthday in my email 3 months ago. The staff also came over and took a picture of us and send it to my email (which they already have it in record. I did not have to provide them with it) Food wise, lots of seafood. Alaska crab legs, crayfish, crabs, prawns, 2 types of oysters and lots more. I loved that they also serve Sword fish sashimi which not many buffet places does that. The staff are also very efficient in clearing the plates from our table.Definitely will come back here again. One thing i don't like is they only have hot drinks and ice water. Any other cold drinks comes at a very high price. For that price I'm paying, they should at least serve some cold drinks. And also, their buffet counter close at 9.30pm which is quite early
5
Their high tea spread was fantastic. The spread has a fair selection of both local and international food delights. We did not get to try out everything though as we were quite full. It was overall a wonderful time spent and we enjoyed the food.It's a great place to celebrate occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or just to have a good meal with friends and family. They have a crew that sings to birthday audiences and the birthday boy/girl gets a small cake. The service staff is very friendly
5
I am sure my wife & I will be there again! We love the service and food, a great memory for our anniversary.
5
Loved the food. Good balance, taste & spread.
More importantly its halal (was told that the hotel did not get halal certification from the strict local authorities due to alcohol being served in its other restaurant)
5
Second visit to Carousel for a family celebration and they never disappoint. Service staff is attentive. Surprise celebration for my mum was also wonderfully executed.
5
Whether you are looking for western, european, asian or anything in between you cant go past the Carousel Buffet!!We spent 5 days here, having just returned from our short holiday, and ate something different every day! I am sure if you stayed a month you still could have something different each day!very clean, fresh and tasty. the staff are very attentive and friendly too.a place to have a full hearty breakfast and fuel up for the day
4
Great ambience and many variety of great delicious food to choose! From seafood to japanese to chinese and last but not least, DESSERTS!!!! However, i went on Saturday the weekend, thus it's really really crowded and getting the food is a bit hard as some of them wasn't that civilised in getting their food.However, i like the staff actually announced customers birthday by playing and singing the Bday songs aloud by dancing as well. Which then they will distribute small cupcakes to the respective bday boy / girl. We got a birthday and anniversary cake as well so that was a pleasant surprise for us! :)Overall, even though it's pricey, i think it's appropriate for the great food that's served, nice experience and will definitely come back BUT during the weekday. :
4
My wife loved this buffet restaurant and it's the second time that we celebrated our anniversary here. We also celebrated our anniversary once at The Line in Shangri La which is also one of the best buffet restaurant, but it's more expensive and slightly below Carousel in terms food quality and variety. I've tried numerous buffet restaurants but so far, no one can beat Carousel in terms of price versus taste plus variety in my opinion. So high chance that my wife will request the same restaurant for our future anniversary celebrations. I only wish if we can start the lunch buffet earlier like 11.30am, that would be perfect.Keep up the excellency
5
We had a small gathering of 40 pax for dinner after solemnization. The staffs were well coordinated for our arrival, and attentive to our requests. We even received flowers and cake for our occasion. Food wise, a great spread of choice, have good mix of local and international food. Seafood are very fresh, especially oyster. As a dessert lover, mousse is a must try. Everyone was happy with the food.The price may be a little bit high, but value for money given the excellent quality of food and service. It is cheaper than most hotel's buffet. They also have 10% discount for a range of credit cards, remember to ask them before settling your bill.Do make your reservation, as it is always full even for weekdays dinner
5
The food - the selection was great, the taste was scrumptious! The freshness of the seafood, and Japanese selection was beyond what i had been taught to expect in Singapore. The crab, raw fish selection was literally melt in your mouth! The mild sweetness with a tang of salt in the prawns and shrimps was to die for! Not forgetting the salad and dessert bar! The array of salads was a dream come true for me. Then there was the desserts the made me throw my diet out of the window! I was literally spoiled for choice with the spread of desserts! A definite must try is the apple pie crumble and the pear and chocolate combo! Wow! just those 2 and i was tempted to go for 3rds
5
I've been a patron of Carousel for a while. Always love the food. The variety is so wide that you'll be spoilt for choice. The sashimi and seafood is always fresh. My family and I will definitely be coming to Carousel for more meals and celebrations :)Thank you Carousel, for always being thw best.
5
I was there on 13/12/2014, and to my surprise that we had been greeted by the most professional F & B Staff, this is the first restaurant that we have this kind of service, we were there to celebrate my daughter 5th birthday, the food is fantastic. I would like to recommend to all my friends, social media and traveller to go there and give it a try, but remember Walk In is not recommended due to seating arrangement. Keep up the good job
5
Fantastic buffet spread as alwys. Super love their fresh seafood! OMG! The fresh crab taste still lingers. Ive alwys love their food. Nvr failed us. And their wonderful service is 5 star too. Thumbs up to carousel staffs :)
5
Is so touching to c the staff holding the cake, singing the birthday song at my table. Is so thoughtful of yr staff to snap photos of me n family n email it to me. So sweet. Thank you
5
The food spread has always been excellent. I have been there for numerous occasions and they never fall short on the service and taste. You'll be spoilt for choice for Local, Western, Japanese cuisines and the desserts are ossum!
5
This year is our wonderful Anniversary celebration, thanks Carousal give us a surprise. Their foods are fantastic and their services are perfect. I will go again.
4
was here for my dad's 56th birthday celebration. staff was quick in finding my reservation & seats! foods were great, the desserts were my favourite of course (having sweet-tooth!). bread pudding was my top choice, awesomely plate licking good!I salute all the staffs for doing great job!during the birthday symphony, i went WOWWW by the efforts made by the staffs!! simply fantastic!my dad enjoyed his special day plus with the nice slice of birthday cake!thank you so much.will come back again
5
My 2nd visit to carousel..tiz year never expect that the staffs wil come to our table n sing a bday song wif cake... My hubby totally blush & shock wif the situation.. Hahaha thank u carousel!! We love being there for my personal view, i do & always will choose carousel.. Best service,food & atmospher
5
Always love going for Carousel's buffets - the dinner spread is more amazing than its lunch (not that lunch wasn't amazing). It's a great place to celebrate occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or just to have a good meal with friends and family. They have a crew that sings to birthday audiences and the birthday boy/girl gets a small cake. The service staff is very friendly and prompt in clearing away your plates. Would suggest that you sit closer centre of the dining space than this sectioned area closest to the reception - livelier. :
5
Celebrated our 20th Wedding Anniversary at Carousel on 9 Dec. Their high tea spread was fantastic. The spread has a fair selection of both local and international food delights. We did not get to try out everything though as we were quite full. It was overall a wonderful time spent and we enjoyed the food. The service was excellent with very prompt clearing of plates. The birthday celebration and song for the special guests was a great idea. We got a slice of cake also for our anniversary but a pity though there's no special song dedicated for this occasion. It was also a nice gesture for them to email us the photo taken on this special occasion
5
One of the best buffet spread I ever had. The food items were always replenished and there was never a moment where the certain food items were empty or never replenished again which is very common in other similar hotels international buffet. The service staff were also very polite and friendly which is very rare to encounter nowadays. Definitely be back again when I can
4
It's a buffet, so it will be hard to resist the wide variety and spread. And you've paid above $50 anyway right? Any attempt to watch the calories will be to choose seafood over meats I guess, and go easy on the desserts. But again, it's probably the time to let loose isn't it.... otherwise you wouldn't be there !Note : It is a muslim-friendly restaurant, so do not expect any pork or related to be available
5
Went for high tea on a Saturday; wide array of food and great for children (esp. the dessert bar with 3 fondue fountains). Service was fabulous. Overall an enjoyable experience.
5
We went there for a year end gathering. All my colleague loves it. This is the best halal buffet in Singapore. Yummielicious international food spread! Go Try!
5
I love the food there, many variety and the staff was friendly.. I totally enjoyed my birthday celebration there. It was worth it and the cake they serve was delicious.. 👍
5
Wow, what an array of food and the quality is excellent.Went to the afternoon buffef. Fabulous food and excellent quality.
5
Great food, especially the seafood bar.
My favorite in Singapore, bar none, always a must visit place!!!
5
Carousel Buffet , the best buffet dinner experience I had in Singapore so far, and i think it'll be the top 1 buffet choice in Singapore after this.
5
Everything about this place is excellent. Excellent staff. Excellent food. Excellent choice. Excellent layout ... One thing missing some of the chairs are ripped ...
5
Last minute helping out to do proposal arrangement for boss to propose his girlfriend. Manage to get the good table even restaurant fully committed. I really appreciate to the all staff for helping out and giving a good idea for the proposal. Food was excellent and yummy. We really enjoy that night. I definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends.
4
I have been the regular to their restaurant for lunch, Hi-tea and dinner and still a fan of them. the only set-back is that some of the dishes has been repeat from lunch to dinner.Management should look into changes of the menus. As for the service crews they are superb No doubt about it
5
If you couldn't place a dinner reservation on their online booking page, call up the phone number listed and ask to be put on their wait-list. We did just that the day before we intended to dine there and by noon on the day itself, they called to confirm a spot for us for 3 persons. You can also check with them when you call as to how long is the wait-list and the possibility of a better-chance day.The variety of the buffet spread is impressive, for sure. The seafood station appears to be the most popular ! And then the dessert station.The fresh oysters served are from Canada. Staff are indeed well-trained and very efficient.Best place to spend a long, languid dinner 
5
Evetything is great about Carousel. The food is excellent, service is top notch. The seafood section is great, cold crab is a favorite. India food section is a must try, tandoori chicken is mouth watering. Great place for affordable buffet.
5
The food was great. Every staff put on their best smiles. We enjoyed our lunch very much. Thumbs up!
4
Been here twice with family and friends. Thoroughly enjoyed both occasions given the wide spread of food. Despite being crowded, service was prompt. Definitely recommend this place for buffet hunters!
4
Great variety of food presented very well and all very tasty. Catered to all tastes with a variety of Asian, Indian, Japanese and European foods available. Would strongly recommend for lunch and dinner buffet, but you need to make reservation.
5
After reading the very positive reviews of this restaurant and as I was staying very close by, I decided to visit for dinner one night in November 2014. I had booked on line well in advance before I left for my holiday.Upon arrival at 6.30 p.m. I was greeted very warmly and was immediately shown to my table. My waiter explained the layout of the restaurant and where the different types of foods were located. As he left, another waiter arrived with an ipad and suggested that I mark on the ipad which drink I would like and that he would return shortly to collect it. Very easy. As promised, he returned quickly and very soon I was sipping a lovely cold fruit juice.The restaurant was full with family groups, couples, and like myself, a few solo diners. There were also quite a few children present and I found the atmosphere to be lively and cheerful. I loved seeing the family groups enjoying each other's company and having a good time.I found the quality of the food to be excellent. It was impossible to try everything, however I found the seafood to be fresh and the hot dishes that I tried to be of high quality. The chefs at each station were friendly and helpful also.I particularly enjoyed the CrÃ¨me Brule and also Carousel's bread and butter pudding with vanilla sauce which was suggested to me by my very helpful and attentive waiter, Arnold.I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. Although I could have felt a little uncomfortable as I was dining alone amongst so many groups, the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff made me feel at ease.I highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return again when next visiting Singapor
5
Been here a couple of times and I'd put Carousel buffett on my top 2 of best buffett in Singapore, in terms of price and food quality. I've tried their breakfast, lunch, high tea, and dinner buffett, I think the high tea buffet are the most value for money. They have a big spread of seafood, what I like very much though was their nasi lemak and baked potatoes, very very nice. I came there during my anniversary with my girlfriend and they surpised us by giving us a cupcake, it's not much but the gesture definitely much appreciate
5
So impressed! Food amazing, staff just so fantastic best service ever!So disappointed not to be able to get a booking for dinner the whole week we were there. Next time we go back we will book before we leave!Management should be so happy with the staff they have they are fabulous
5
This is my 3rd time dining at carousel. I have dine at this restaurant 4 year back. There are alot of changes in terms of service. I feel so welcome the moment i am in front of the restaurant. Their service are tip top which other hotel's restaurant should take some tips from. Very personalised. Wide and spoil for choice. If i want to dine in a restaurant, this is definitely my 1st choice
3
The price is good for hightea option at 3:30pm, but the amount of people milling about, touching and breathing on food, is not very appetising, I went awhile back to a dinner buffet and it was good, pricey but good. But this price point seems to attract too many people, which makes the experience less than ideal
4
I felt too many frozen seafood.. and all serve in cold which I felt this can be improve and too less variety of Hot food... the original frozen yogurt was awesome , and the ice-cream too. I love the 3 type ( Green, Red and Chocolate) fondue.. and the dessert and cake was impress me too.. http://catpiab1234.blogspot.sg/2014/11/royal-plaza-on-scott-carousel-14nov2014.htm

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet here while we were staying at the hotel. Lot's of choice and variety including western and asian dishes. An egg station as well as a noodle station.
The staff very friendly and accommodating.
4
Enjoyed e Happy BD 'performance'...staff were enthusiastic!
Good variety of food...wld be even better if there was beef cuts :)
5
The assortment of sea food, desserts, everything is just perfect. A lot of local people that shows that the place nice and all food is fresh and tasty where everyone wants to return.
5
It was a good experience dining in Carousel and celebrating my boyfriend birthday. Other than the special birthday song and cake session by Carousel, we were impressed by one of the chefs (named Colin) who approached us when we walked around the counter. He introduced all the available food type and concept in Carousel. His explanation was detailed and professional which made us felt great. Other stuffs in Carousel were friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Colin, it was a wonderful dining experience and we will definitely go again
3
We visited one evening and felt it was too pricey but decided to give it a go! There was an excellent variety of food on offer. Seafood was not fresh but had been thawed, and hot foods were only warm! The area was over crowded which resulted in tables being virtually on top of one another. We sat on a table for two, but the adjacent people were seated so close it was like we were on a table for four! Not what we were expecting!
5
Celebrated my girl 21st Birthday at Carousel was a good experience. She totally loves the place, the food and the birthday's surprises. Service was good and the table was cleared fast. My family are seafood lovers. We went crazy over the variety of seafood served there. The seafood are so fresh and I love the oyster. The shell was freshly opened on the spot. The sashimi and sushi section is also our favorite. The sashimi are so fresh and sushi are really good. Another stop is the desert section. It is must to go especially the Chocolate fountain. It is not just one but three different flavored chocolate fountain.We highly recommended Carousel for good dining experience
5
We hesitated about making a booking thinking it was quite expensive. However, when you consider the price of a decent three course meal in Singapore, this proved exceptional value. There is a huge variety of Seafood, Asian, Orinetal and Western dishes available and whilst we couldn't compete with some of the patrons on quantity, we found the quality of our meal first class. We concentrated on the lobster, poached salmon and a variety of freshly cooked and very tasty Indian dishes. We managed to leave enough room for a couple of desserts but it was a struggle. if I visited again I would have a light breakfast, avoid lunch and arrive as hungry as possible

Unlike other places such as Japan and New York where the cupcake wave has retreated as a popular pastime, cupcakes continue to hold sway in Singapore as more bakeries and cafes enter the scene to fight the sweet pie. Here comes the Artisan Cupcakes, modern savvy interpretations of that humble confection by the skilled patissiers. There are 12 different flavours in all, a mixture of sweet and SAVOURY :)I highly recommend the Chocolat; transcendent, luscious, perfectly deep cocoa flavours. Hats off to the chef who managed to grasp the essence of chocolate. The Red Velvet exudes an easy-going charm with its moist fluffy interior and cream cheese frosting. But like all meringues, the topping of a raspberry meringue ball is on the very sweet side, so be warned. I love the Salted Egg Yolk, not just because it is beautifully adorned with a "sunny side egg" constructed of a mildly tart mango ravioli and whipped cream, but because the salted egg yolk bits and crunchy Chinese melon nuts gave this an oriental festive twist. Like celebrating Chinese New Year and Mooncake festival at the same time.I thought the Salted Egg Yolk was already quirkily tasty but the Corn & Scallion was even better. This one has a very sour greenish potato mousseline frosting that was not overpowered by the scallions, an ideal contrast to the cake that is marginally sweetened with crunchy kernel corns.

The food is very nice,service is excellent,environment is very good. We went for lunch to celebrate my parents birthday with my wife and son. They arrange special cakes with candles for my parents. The staffs are warmhearted especially the beautiful Amal. She is very patient and full of passion. She was entertaining my naughty 10months old son so she can took nice photos for my whole family. Really great experience! The dining time of 2 hrs is a bit short. Overall it is worth to visit again
5

Although I was not looking for a halal certified food, I guess this is the place I will suggest to my friends who are visiting singapore and want to try a very good spread that includes local delights, fresh seafood and amazing desserts.They had lobsters and Alaskan king crabs, need I say more for seafood lovers? A live teppaniyaki station will fry your lobsters if you want to and you can dig in as much as you want. There was also chili crab and chicken rice, although I did not try since I already have them often, but if you are on a short trip you will love having everything at one place.Most of all, it was my wife's birthday and also a number of patrons', so they came up, sang and clapped with a complementary cake for all of the birthday people which was nice. Booking can be tricky as they seem to be filled up 10-15 days in advance, I guess being one of the few halal buffets in Singapore has something to do with that. A bit pricey, but unlimited lobsters are not suppose to be cheap obviously. Great place, great experience. (I had 5 creme brulees, they were good

I was here on my anniversary for Sunday dinner recently. Well, firstly, i am a chef at a hotel and we do buffets on regular basis. But this buffet particularly, swept me off my feet and left me drooling. The seafood here is super fresh. A wide variety of seafood to choose from. The sashimi counter was pre-cut which means you can take mountains of salmon and tuna without looking greedy! There's also a live teppanyaki counter. The hot section is a treat. I tried the Candied Beef Ribs. Came back for more. The carving station had a choice of white or red meat with a lot of sauces and condiments to choose from. The indian, local and pasta live station is a must try. Lastly, the dessert. You have yoghurt, icecream, cakes, puddings and.... *drumroll* chocolate fondue. My wife went nuts when she saw the dessert counter until she wanted to skip everything and just eat dessert. Haha! The ambience, service and food is good in every aspect from the reservation call itself. Rarely do we get asked if we are reserving for a special occasion. I was here for my anniversary and they made it special for me and my wife. Not only that, there were some guests' birthdays too. And honestly, i had never seen every single staff stop doing what they were doing and sing happy birthday and cheering and clapping. This is not just a buffet or a restaurant. It's a place for family, loved ones and bonding. It makes you feel comfortable. Personally, i would rate it 10 out of 5, but i guess, you guys have to find out for yourselves too. So go, enjoy the buffet, its a must.

The staff were very friendly to provide us a reminder call when I made a reservation for my significant other's birthday. They were detailed enough to provide a birthday cake and even a birthday song. What I was most impressed was the small touches such as helping us to take a photo with their iPad and sending it to my email. I really like that alot. The food was excellent especially the seafood section. I will definitely go back again
5
Had a great hearty meal with a wide array of choices from fresh seafoods to Western to Asian delicacies and desserts. Staffs went the extra mile to make it an even more enjoyable dining experience for my family and I. I'd totally recommend everyone to try Carousel's excellent food and service. 
5
I'm recovering from my ankle fracture, thus I can only walk very slowly but their stuff spotted me and get me seat immediately. Their service is always tip top and my family has visited Caousel many times. My family like their wide choices of food especially desserts - western type (yummy but not too sweet), local / chinese type, ice cream and also my favourite healthy yogurt (plain and mango). We are celebrating my sister birthday, they provide complimentary cake, birthday song and took photographs for my whole family using their ipad, then email the photographs to me

I heard many good reviews from my friends about Carousel and finally tried it yesterday. It was a good experience. For both the service and food quality. The seafood were so fresh and juicy. Just the prawns might be kinda too salty. Other than that, it was good. The services were good too. Friendly staffs. Will definitely go back again!
4
We came to celebrate a birthday. The performance from the staff is really cool and enjoyable.
The food is good and lots of choice. However the restaurant room is too dim.
5
Came here for my spouse's birthday and it was really awesome. Great experience and wonderful service. Will definitely recommend to my friends and family. Ambience was really awesome as well! And the birthday dance they had were real cool too!
4
Enjoyed this restaurant , very good selection , have to get there early because it seems most of Singapore were there, and if the locals eat there it's good . Staff sang happy birthday and gave me a cake
5
Our family enjoyed the food so much! Their noodle soups are very tasteful. The ambience is welcoming for a family or for a business trip. I could only wish they also offer more options for rice meals.
5
I love celebrating special occasions at Carousel as they will take note of your special request seriously. Great desserts too! A must try👍
5
From the beginning of the reservation through their emails to the end of the dining was a fantastic experience. They replied my email very promptly and provided me with the information i needed to know about the prices, menu and also special efforts made for birthday person. When we reached Carousel we were escorted to our seats by a very nice lady who showed her sincerity in her service. After that there was a Carousel staff who approached me and informed me about the birthday celebration that will be held at 1.20pm. (Lunch time was 12pm-2pm on Sat) To my surprise at 1.20pm a birthday song started from the restaurant and candles of birthday cake slices started to come out and every one of their staff including the chefs came out to clap and sing the birthday song. They gave the cakes to all the birthday people in the restaurant at once and it was a very very pleasant time for us. Really appreciate their efforts for this and their concern for their patrons. A job well done to the Carousel team. Thank you! ^

This is my first time having my dinner at Carousel. My wife and I had a great time. Their service is excellent. The foods are delicious and lot of variety to choose. My advise is advance online booking if you really want to have your meal at Carousel as it always fully book if walk in

This is my second time visiting Carousel while the first time is back in 2009. I can't remember much but I had pretty good impression about this place so I decided to visit this place again.Upon arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff and were lead to our seats after checking our reservation. There are quite a variety of food there and I think the most selection goes to the seafood. It has oysters, crab, mussels, scallops and more. The Japanese food comes with some sashimi and sushi. There wasn't a lot to choose from but the classic salmon and tuna are definitely there.The cook food selection however is a little disappointing because it is always empty and when it is refilled, it quantity is always small and getting a second serving is really hard. The chef station food on roasted meat have chicken and beef. The beef is pretty good while the chicken tasted boring. Another chef station serves chicken rice and laksa. The chicken rice has poor rice but good chili. I think there is another station but I didn't try that.Luckily all these are saved by the dessert selection. There is a yogurt machine! My first ever encounter ever in a buffet. The cakes, pudding and ice cream will be enough to keep your dessert stomach filled, happy and smiling.Other selections available in the restaurant are salad bar and a couple of fruits selection which is not worth mentioning. To sum it up, I think the food selection is pretty decent for such seating space. The highlight of the restaurant is seafood and dessert. The restaurant has one of the best service I've ever seen and they took the extra effort to celebrate the customer 'special occasion'. Oh, I haven't mention the birthday dance. That's fantastic. I totally loved it. For anyone looking or considering Carousel, wait no further and try it out. I would totally recommend it and I will go back again for sure. Just something to know is that you should make reservation to guarantee a seat. Walk in is not recommended
5
Service was excellent, the staffs were constantly clearing our plates and serving us with smiles. The dinner was for my mum's birthday and they served her a small slice of cake and there was a performance by the staffs as well. Of so many restaurants I've gone so far, I think Carousel has one of the best service. There's a huge spread of food, I was too full to explore all sections. Will return to try the rest of the food again someday
5
We were at carousel for high-tea today and were we're impressed with the staff, their service and also the food. This is not our first visit but yet each time the service is superb. The staff really make their guests feel very important with their personalized service like today we were served by staff, Mr Mathi whom we were very much impressed and he is a very good example of Carousel"s service ambassadors. Thank U Catousel for making us feel delighted being there and look forward to our next visit to Carousel.
5
Very good and nice place for gathering, any celebration...
Food is good with many variety
Must make a reservations before coming down to avoid disappointment
5
It's one of the best places to have buffet in Singapore. The staff were wonderful and presented an awesome birthday surprise for my brother. They actually broke out in song and dance while wishing all the guests. Wonderful :)
5
Staff was super friendly and prompt at refilling our glasses of water and clearing our plates away.
The food was great. Many new varities to choose from. Will definitely head there again soon
5
Good:-Wide variety of seafood.-Ample seating.-Convenience of being outside the CBD area.Bad:-At times the noise level rises too high =(-Most of the time, there are no discounts tied with any credit card.-Lack of privacy, since they are located at the hotel lobby
4
I went to Carousel with my friends over the weekends. The service is prompt and good. The staff will assist with the clearing of plates at a reasonable time once the diners have polished off the food on their plates. Besides that, they are very friendly and nice. As I was there to celebrate an event, the staff came up to me and offered to take photos for us for keepsake. After which, I received the photos taken on the very same day. It was a pleasant experience for us and the service is superb.However, I feel that there is room for improvements in terms of the variety of food offered. There should be more varieties to choose from such as more variation to the sushi offered, more local delights and also more varieties on the choice of ice-cream made available.Other than that I am very pleased with Carousel on a whole. I will definitely recommend my friends to dine at Carousel! Keep up the excellent service
5
We were surprised by the wide selections of food. The seafood were plentiful and very fresh. There were also lots of cakes, desserts and fruits to choose from. Just so much and don't know what to eat next. The only complaint are the soups (both western & Chinese) which we don't find it tasty or to our liking. The staff were friendly, cheerful looking and helpful. Most of the time our dishes were cleared speedily. We are very happy with our first outing to the restaurant. Thank you for making this trip such a memorable one especially on my birthday

We had really high expectations about this restaurant after reading about it here on TA, and they where not fulfilled.Let me start with saying that I suspect that this restaurant is buying positive reviews.I'm a buffet fan, so it's not that. But the buffet is not good here.The seafood was overcooked, and most of it,I suspect, have been frozen at some point. Sushi was not fresh and the rice looked like it had been molded in some sort of machine and the fish was stale.Warm offering was ok, at most. Dessert the same. (Not fresh, not well produced).Also the interior resembles a cafe, not a restaurant (we had plastic chairs, no table cloth etc).And you don't get new cutlery in between the dishes (small issue, but customary at any buffet restaurant at this price point)In all, you can certainly get better food for a lesser price easily in Singapore, and thats even if you eat for two.Avoid this place
5
If you absolutely can't do 'buffet style', don't go here - but it will be your loss as the quality and breadth of choice for the food is outstanding.It's impossible to do this place justice in just one visit and you'll probably be best off deciding on a theme (or perhaps two!) then sticking with it. Whatever your taste, there's going to be something here to suit, and it will first-class food, prepped and presented as it should be.As we said, superlative
5
I really like how they actually take it into thoughts to help celebrate guests' birthday, it is very heart warming. The service and the staff are really nice, very attentive. And the lightings make the whole place very cozy as well. It was a pleasant experience overall. Will visit again. Keep up the good work Carousel team

Went to carousel for our 10th year anniversary lunch. It's not easy to find halal international buffets around but carousel was a name that kept popping up on Google. The seafood lover in me loved the selection of fresh seafood n honey loved the steak. Yum! Special mention to the awesome guacamole and froyo which were really really very good! What I loved the most was the service - from the super sweet birthday dance to the special anniversary cake to the photos. The staff were extremely polite n courteous. No wonder they are so popular! Would surely reccomend.
4
They have a good selection of different cuisines, a true value for money. The service was impeccable. Excellent overall. Will visit again.
4
The food was very tasty but quite a limited buffet compared to other comparative hotels in singapore
5
Came here to celebrate birthday at the high tea.
The lobster claw, prawns were fresh.
Great food and service.
The service staff put up a dance and song for those celebrating their birthday.
Will come again.

Just had our Anniversary dinner there today. I have been there a couple of times before and its a place where I really enjoyed dining. The food are tasty and the seafood are fresh.. there's also Sashimi and many other choices. Lastly thanks to all the friendly and attentive staff for making efforts to provide great service with smiles. And a Special compliments to Ms Shan for making our day. Cheers

Celebrated a relative’s birthday here recently, and I must say this place is absolutely amazing! What I like about Carousel is that when they claim to serve international cuisine, they really mean international! So apart from the usual buffet staple cuisines like Japanese, they do offer other more exotic cuisines – from a local’s perspective that is – like Mexican (e.g. tacos and guacamole), and even some unique dishes like Hungarian goulash. The amazing thing is, even the variety within the staple cuisines are impressive as well. The best example I can give is definitely the cold seafood section! They offered 2 kinds of crabs, at least 3 different kinds of shellfish, not counting the 2 kinds of mussels, and this is on top of crayfish and prawns! Gosh, this is candyland for any seafood lover! I personally feel that the Japanese section comes in a close second – at least 4 kinds of sashimi and more than 6 kinds of sushi were offered, with some very interesting flavours as well (think mango and caviar sushi). The fried rice prepared by the teppanyaki master is another dish from the Japanese section that’s also quite tasty.I was a tad overzealous at the Japanese and seafood sections, so I didn’t really get a chance to sample much from the other sections. The sweet and sour pork as well as the seafood tofu fritters I tried were all quite tasty. There were other stations, but I decided to give them a miss and went straight for the desserts instead. Carousel boasts quite an impressive array of desserts as well. They have three different sections, probably to split up the buffet-goers, but for some reason, everyone usually just crowds at the section near the entrance. That particular one is where the cakes and pastries are. The second section is where the 3 different-flavoured chocolate fountains and ice cream are, while the last one is where the fruits and puddings are. I felt the mocha cream puffs and the chocolate éclairs were quite outstanding as their cream fillings were flavourful and chilled to perfection. Do give their frozen natural yoghurt a try! It’s white, plain, and unassuming, but it tastes so damn good! It’s not too sour and not too milky, and it’s frozen to just the right texture which makes it an incredibly light and refreshing dessert. I had 3 cups of it without feeling satiated at all!The service here is quite amazing too! If you have anyone celebrating their birthday, do let the staff know, as towards the end of the buffet, they’ll do a mass celebration for all the diners celebrating their birthdays, and you’ll get a complimentary slice of rainbow cake. A member of the staff will also be going round shortly after that to help take group photos, which they will email to you. This is the first restaurant I’ve been to that does this sort of thing, which is really nice of them. It’s probably one of the reasons why they’re ranked so high on TripAdvisor! And at SGD55++ per adult (weekend rate), this is also one of the more affordable buffets around. With great food and exceptional service, Carousel is indeed a great value for money.Oddly enough, I noticed their restaurant website didn’t really have any information on directions. Nearest MRT station is Orchard, and I suggest exiting the station from the ION side, use the underpass to cut through Wheelock to arrive at Shaw. From Shaw just walk down along Scotts Road, past Pacific Plaza and you should reach Royal Plaza on Scotts. Bus services 5, 54, 124, 128, 143, 162, 167, 171, and 700 will stop right outside the building as well. Hope you guys have an enjoyable dining experience at Carousel too! =

If you like buffet restaurants, you must try this one. Very many kinds of food from Asian food to European food and several seafood things. But unfortunately I don't like buffet restaurants. For me it is to noisy and there are to much children. Not a place for a romantic diner
4
Sunday buffet at carousel is a splurge! Masses of seafood, cold dishes, hot dishes and desserts, including a chocolate fountain. Notable highlights: giant prawns, fresh naan, tandoori chicken kebabs, that chocolate fountain!! Service a bit slow (clearing plates, topping up drinks) but its incredibly busy and the staff try to do their best. Bonus: it's all halal. Good for a family outing
5
Carousel last Monday evening laid out a great buffet as many trip advisors said. It was a sumptuous seafood selection! The staff were friendly and attentive. Excellent service. We'll be back for sure on our next visit to Singapore. Thanks, Carousel for the lovely birthday dinner. BURP ! L
5
Carousel's service staff always serve with a warm and sincere smile. It was my friend's birthday and we had ended the night with good food and their warm service. I like the way the team presented my friend with nicely decorated rainbow cake and accompanied with the team singing birthday song for all the guests celebrating birthday. It was simple yet heart warming. Thank you for upholding your passion for giving the best
5
What can I say, this is my 2nd time coming and the service & food never fails to let me down. Was presented with a surprised birthday song and cake for my wife as it was her birthday and it touched her heart warmly. We felt warmly welcomed and to our surprise we were seated at the same table for the 2nd time which is actually our favourite table where we celebrated our Wedding Anniversary the first time we came! We will definitely come back again and again for more! :
5
It was a memorable day for me and my family. The staffs are helpful and welcoming. Food there are awesome. Will visit again!!!
4
Seafood section is awesome and value for money.
They have selections of Asian cuisine and fantastic dessert bar section too.
Service was good.
4
Good selection of food. Sashimi is fresh.
Value for money.
Very friendly n helpful waiters
Surprise cake n nice picture taken from the restaurant.
👍
We will recommend to our friends n will go back again.
5
Went to Carousel for lunch and had a wonderful time, the atmosphere was perfect despite there being a large crowd. The cold dishes were fresh and the wide variety of dishes is definitely a plus point. The service is also impeccable. Excellent overall!
4
Went there for their high tea on a weekday.
The food was delicious, excellent service and good place for gathering.
5
Already many time here. Always maintain high standard. Good food, good service at reasonable price. Keep up and will come again.
5
As always, Carousel lived up its reputation. The spread was tantalising and the the service was superb. Kudos to the team for always ensuring a great dining experience! :)
5
It was a great experience as usual as this was our 3rd time there. Staff was friendly and super helpful. To top it off, there was a mini song and dance from the staff to celebrate some of the guest b'day which included my wife and it was a nice gesture. Keep it up Carousel and will be back for more. Thanks
4
When we enter the restaurant we were Greeted by all the staff.The wide selection of stations with seafood & Asian cuisine that suits us. The food taste great and the spread is awesome.. but the duration of the Hi tea is rather short coz there is too much to eat
4
Came across this by chance and walked away impressed with the following:1) very good spread - hot section - meat cuts, pasta section, indian (tandoori and kebabs), Chinese, cold seafood and sashimi and great selection of dessert2) good and prompt service - very quick to clear plates and everything else required. Seems to be a great place to celebrate birthdays or other special events - the staff came out at around 230pm to sing a birthday song for those celebrating - and even put on a little dance as well. After that, a special cupcake with a candle is given to those celebrating.Singapore is not a cheap place but given the selection, at SGD55, it seems reasonable. I never have a big appetite but it is still a worthwhile place to check out if you have 2 hours to spare for lunch.Do make reservations on weekends. Don't expect to be able to pop in if you don't have one
5
Wide range of tasty food from different cuisines - from appetiser to dessert. Classy setting and comfortable seating plans. Will always choose carousel over other halal buffets as of now.
4
It was my first time here at Carousel and I was impressed with the service & the wide buffet spread ranging from local favourites to international food. We were surprised with a small birthday cake from the service staff. Would come back here again !
5
Excellent service. Great atmosphere. Awesome place. Good prices good food. Thank you for the wonderful surprise carousel:) Today has been the best day. Will come again. And spread the great service to others:) Good job!!!
5
Carousel has never failed to make me give 2 thumbs up. Even though I am a Singaporean, Carousel has been the best hotel restaurant that I have ever visited. Food is superb and awesome! Service is great!
5
As it was my birthday, my boyfriend brought me here well its not our first time but our 4th time and carousel never fails to impress ! And im a muslim , so basically carousel offers the best halal cousine in singapore. I BELIEVE!! ^^
5
The variety of food on offer at breakfast is excellent, the food is very clean. Staff are always will to help and make you welcome
4
My hubby and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Carousel on a Saturday. We were surprised by the special gift prepared by the restaurant... a slice of cake with the words "Happy Anniversary" and "Forever Love" written on the cake! We had a wonderful high-tea at Carousel
3
Brought some foreign guests to the high tea. It was one of few places with halal high tea buffet.Food was good quality but spread not good enough for the price. It was way too noisy and crowded to justify the price which should have gotten a classier atmosphere.Food was sometimes slow to refill, especially the more popular dishes.Overall I would go there again if I were entertaining people who needed halal food, but not otherwise.
5
It was our first high tea here to celebrate our anniversary and we were happy of the varieties of foods being served there with so many choices to choose from. I like the place it was a great ambience and the suprised cake too! The Staffs are great and friendly too! Great job guys keep up the good foods and services! We will definately come again to try the lunch or dinner buffet
5
This have been our annual anniversary/birthday celebration venue for the past few years. And so far it didn't disappoint us ! Great food, variety of choices, wonderful ambience. Great service by the staffs too. very friendly staffs. Food replenished almost every time the servings are emptied. Good choice of place to go for the buffet for gatherings, special occasions, etc
4
Service Excellence, Food Varieties Amazing (especially Desserts for Buffet Lunch) Incredibly pleasant 1st visit to Carousel!
4
Wide choice of food, good service, nothing else to ask for. Call to reserve as it is popular place for diners.
5
Thumbs up for the extra effort put in for birthday celebrations, was pretty impressed with how all the service staff stood together for the bday song! Huge buffet spread, quality food at really affordable prices! Will be back for sure! :)
5
On 2 Oct 2014, my colleagues and I were having lunch at Carousel from 12.30pm to 2.pm. Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. Perfect Lunch.
5
Buffet is well spread... love the seafood varieties... dessert... fruits...ice cream...great service too...
5
International buffet with delectable selection of food and the price is not that expensive. Heartwarming atmosphere and staffs were really friendly.
5
Good food, nice staff, great atmosphere.
Above all, the birthday song was more than excellent. My son enjoy his birthday. Thank you!
5
Brought my wife to Carousel to celebrate her birthday. We have a great time of celebration over the wide variety of food accompany with great ambience, service and surprise. She was touch when the service staff gather to sing birthday song and present her a cake.Before we left, a photo with both of us which took earlier by the staff landed in my email account.. Super efficient and hospitable!
4
Went there for high tea as part of birthday celebration. This place appears to be fully booked if you don't put in the reservation early. Relatively good choices of food - sashimi, laksa, fresh prawn, satay, beef shabu shabu, sushi, nasi lemak, chicken/duck rice and the usual cakes/dessert/ice-cream/fruits. A piece of cake with lit candle was presented to the person celebrating his/her birthday. I noticed that there are a lot of people celebrating their birthday in this restaurant. They even broadcast the birthday song over the loud speaker! For those who drive, be aware that they do not provide complimentary parking, unless you are a staying guest. 10% discount will be given to payment done using the major credit cards. Overall, a value for money meal
4
Great atmosphere, great service, great food, great variety!what's more to say?Have been going there for special occasions like birthdays, homecoming etc.They do those birthday stunts where their staff will go round your table and sing birthday for you - something that it's hard to see nowadays in SG.Still, variety and quality of food is enough to burst your stomach - unless you have a stomach as huge as the universe, ranging for the cheese board, seafood, sushi, curry, rice, dessertssssss (yes, because they have a rather wide range of desserts).Worth trying if you haven't done so! And nope, they did not buy me in to write this review. =
5
Came for high tea to celebrate my fiance birthday. Food n ambience was perfect. Staffs were friendly. Even organise a staff dance for the birthday people. WIth a slice of cake for all d people celebrating bday. Thank u so much.
4
This place doesn't serve pork :( but the quality of the food makes up for it. Love the pasta & sashimi station.
4
We had birthday celebration for my siblings. Birthday song was sang and staff dance along. Great experience and birthday boy was very overwhelmed .
Nice ambience , great variety of food , great customer service. Will definitely dine in again.
5
Excellent services... thank you for the wonderful memory.. will definitely come back as a place to gather.
5
Great coffee,limitless it seemed and good choice of food,attentive staff.quiet corners ,excellent wifi,

We had lunch (Wednesday) to celebrate Administrative Professional Week, and we really appreciated that they seated us together (I think we are about 20 pax). It was really crowded since they prearranged that day for all Administrative Professionals. But I must commend that even there are a lot of patrons, we have an excellent experience. First, with the environment, spacious area and well lighted. Second, food variety – two thumbs up! I don’t hear any negative feedback at least from our group. The buffet spread is excellent! I enjoyed a lot the seafood section. The staff are very attentive in replenishing the food. Third, I must say that they have well-trained staffs, attending to all their patrons’ demands but still give you courtesy and friendly smile. Lastly, we greatly appreciated their effort to celebrate or honor all administrative professionals and even give us discounts and souvenir gifts. Highly recommended
5
A truly exceptional array of fresh seafood - oysters, lobsters and crabs - plus hot food of major cuisines. Pasta and noodle soup cooked to order. At Singapore $80 per person it's by no means cheap, but the value far exceeded our expectation. It's well worth skipping a mean for
5
We had lunch on a Saturday at this restaurant. There was a wide variety of food here, and the seafood and sashimi were fresh and constantly replenished. Service was excellent, with attentive staff wearing friendly smiles. Several groups at the restaurant were celebrating birthdays and the staff put up a little song and dance show while giving birthday cake slices to the birthday girls/boys. It was fun to watch
4
Went to Carousel with my wife to celebrate her birthday yesterday, (28th Sept). It was an enjoyable dining experience. The service is good and efficient, and the birthday song and dance shows that nice thought to patrons. I wife like the atmosphere, and also the service there. The seafood and desserts spread were good, the shasimi slices are too thick. The cooked food were OK, the tepanyaki was not bad either. The roast beef and chicken can be better. Overall, it is a nice experience and we enjoy it, even though it's bit pricey
5
Ate here with my husband, celebrating our wedding anniversary. Wonderful selection of food, including of course the fabulous seafood, and also Indian, pasta, Chinese and then there was dessert. Fantastic selection including a chocolate fountain.This would have to be one of the best buffet dinners I have ever experienced. Staff were very attentive, clearing away dirty plates and seafood shells very quickly. We were given some cake for our anniversary which was quite delicious. Would thoroughly recommend the Carousel
4
Good international selection, especially the cakes! Complimentary cupcakes were offered for special occasions. Perhaps there could an additional section for vegetarian diners.
5
Amazing food. Fresh and incredible variety. Excellent service.
Constantly filling up water, asking if we needed anything and clearing our table. We went to bed dreamig about the food we ate!!
5
I was impressed with how friendly and efficient the staffs were. They knew what you need before you even ask. They have a wide variety of everything... Its difficult to choose! We were celebrating my brother's birthday and they senerade him and all others who are celebrating as well. It was a wonderful experience all in all....:) food was extremely sumptuous... Thank you carousel!
4
Carousel never disappoint. This was my second visit this year but this time it is for hi-tea to celebrate the birthday of 2 of my cousins. The food was amazing (I understand from the staff that the menu has recently been changed. so two thumbs up for the change). The birthday "performance" was great.... the two birthday girls enjoyed it A LOT!. I would like to give a shout-out to Ms Lena.... she was very friendly and approachable and sincere. Thank you for such a great service Ms Lena and for remembering my name :) . All in all, I want to say that you will never be disappointed if you dine at Carousel
4
I'd made an online reservation to celebrate the birthdays of 3 of my friends. The online reservation was nice, as it was easy to use and I really liked that they asked if you are there for a special occasion. I'd selected the birthday option and was wondering how are they going to tell who are the birthday celebrants. It was nice that they called and checked with me who are celebrating the birthday. My friends and I were really happy over the special cake they made for the birthday girls and we had lots of fun there. The service is really award winning and I really love how they come and ask us once in a while if we liked the food etc. We went for a weekend high tea buffet so it was pretty packed. The food was great but we often have to wait for a long time for the chefs to top up as the food constantly disappeared really fast. Overall had a great experience and I would love to go back again. Thank you also for taking a picture of us and emailing the picture to me (it was quite a surprise because we were wondering where would the pic be posted). I absolutely love the experience I had there!!

I had dinner with 12 of my committee colleagues. I must admit that there is a huge variety of food especially seafood. It is a waste that the seafood is very overcooked. The beef and lamb were ok. Sashimi is good. The cooked foods are ok. Perhaps i am a little picky. I've eaten better seafood buffets with good roasts and its cheaper than Carousel. The service is good. The waiters clear the plates quickly and even sung birthday song to the patrons.Anyway, it was paid by my company so i cannot complain but i will not pay for that price to eat here again. Its not worth it and you need to make a reservation early. they will charge you if there is a no show at last min. Nothing fascinating

Everything starts from the phone reservation/the greetings upon arriving at the restaurant/service from the servers was phenomenon.Chose The Carousel to have a birthday luncheon which they are well known for its fine buffet spread and the warm hospitality service given by the hosts and the servers which is so hard to find nowadays in big hotels. Just the little thoughts that really counts which wants to make you come back to dine with them once again.Nevertheless. need not to say about the buffet line displayed."GREAT FOOD COMPLIMENTS GREAT SERVICE"If anyone is looking for good buffet/service, look no further people cause you are looking at it now!!!Well done, keep up the good work guys! (The Team of The Carousel

This Buffet has everything Indian, Chinese, Japanese and plenty of seafood the food is great and it cant get any fresher than when you go to grab some oysters and one of the staff shuck them for you right there and then. if you are a seafood buff you will love everything about this and even if you are not it still has plenty of other foods to tempt your taste bud
5
They not only have a wide range of starters but their seafood are fresh n unconventional!!! Of course you have your usual sashimi and cold cuts but what was surprising is that they had various salads ranging from western to Mediterranean style( mayb coz this place is 1 of the few buffet which is halal) and the hot stations are good as well offering chinese western Malay and Indian food... DEFNITELY have to go again!!!

Being a Melbourne boy, i thought Melba's at the Langham Hotel in Melbourne was pretty special when it came to buffets. I was right, until about 2 hours ago when I walked into Carousel. Amazing. Simply incredible buffet. Staff friendly and attentive, and the food selection is first rate. I enjoyed fresh seafood, roast, Indian, Asian and Pasta followed by the best bread and butter pudding ever - better than my own which is now my second all time fave. i have never reviewed anything immediately upon walking out the door until now. It is that good. Thanks Carousel, a new standard has been set
4
Was welcomed by their friendly staffs. As i am 6mths pregnant, they gave me a pillow to support my back. Their foods was fabulous and love their warm hospitality.
4
International selection and freshness was excellent. Each night we enjoyed cocktails and in the mornings the Asian breakfast was our selection from the international foods
5
Awesome!!!! Great food especially the Vanilla Bread Pudding.....just love the taste, great atmosphere. ....love the place.....................

I had reservations about this restaurant because of the price, that was quickly swept out the door.People on reception were very good and recognised my booking immediately and took us straight to the table. Explanation of what was available was quickly explained.From 8:15 to 9:30 we had so many choices to pick from and I didn't get one that I didn't like.The waitress that looked after our table always had our dirty plates taken away before we came back with another dish, she was very good.The food was exceptional and every time someone came back we asked what they had and what it was like.So a great night and I thank the Carousel restaurant for running such a fine establishment

Reserved during day time to celebrate hubby's birthday dinner. The reception answering the phone was pleasant. Took down the time and asked whether is it to celebrate anything and I was updated with singing going to be held at 8pm. Went there at 6.30pm and was served to the seating area by the attending waiter. We went for seafood first and was not disappointed. All very fresh with so many wide varieties to choose from - snow crab to snail to scallop, oysters and large prawns. Very tasty. I went round to try every single dishes that they cook there. The chefs were very attentive and always filling up the almost empty plates. Wide varieties of desserts like cake and pudding but I find that the taste are just ok. Cut fruits are very sweet. The price is a bit high for dinner but since it's a celebration it was worth coming here. Will go again if there's another occasion to celebrate
5
First thing when I entered the restaurant, the staff were really friendly and welcomed the group of us with big smiles and utmost courtesy. Then they asked if we're familiar with the restaurant and how it operates and explained the types of food and the highlight for the lunch buffet. The range of food they have is so vast that one can fill his/her stomach with just one bite of half of the dishes presented. They've got sushi, sashimi, teppenyaki, fresh seafood (crayfish, prawns, scallops), turkish food, hot stations like asian noodles, naan bread (piping hot garlicky tasty!!!), curries, braised duck, black pepper prawns, salads (mix it your own or there're 6 types of ready made salad to choose from). Being a sucker for dessert, the highlight for me were the desserts selection. They've got everything form eclair to cheesecakes to creme brulee to jelly shooters to 3 types (chocolate, matcha and rose) fondue with a variety of delicacies to dip in to. They've also got frozen yoghurt with a variety of cereals like fruit loops and raisins crunch to end the buffet with. My favourite dessert at Carousel is definitely the bread and butter pudding. No one does it like Carousel, with the creamy and thick vanilla sauce which gets soaked up by the melt-in-your-mouth pudding which is the nicely baked on the top. They've also got pulau hitam (black glutinous rice) with dried longans and coconut milk on the side. The pulau hitam is a hit with my boyfriend because he loves coconut (and anything related to it) and the the dessert was thick and not watered down like those being sold in the hawker centres. And honestly, how often do you get dried longans in pulau hitam?! Most importantly, I must commend on the staff's attentiveness and the warm approach that Carousel has employed in making an effort to make everyone's day, especially for the birthday boys/girls/men/women. Once we were seated, they've asked me who is the birthday girl/boy and said that they've prepared a cake and will be celebrating the birthday at 1.20pm. And that was exactly what they did. The staff gathered around and sang and danced while the cupcakes for those celebrating their birthdays were brought out. I was surprised that there were so many people celebrating their birthdays at Carousel, and now I understand why. The staff were so nice and wrapped up the pretty little cupcake for my boyfriend's mother when we said we were to stuffed from the buffet.Upon leaving, we requested the staff to take photos for us and they're so nice and friendly about it even though they're busy bustling around clearing plates. I've not seen any staff so eager to clear people's plates. They're really efficient and polite.Overall, the service is fantastic. The food is very good. The selection of food will burst anyone's tummy. Great job Carousel! I've been there twice before and I have to say the food and service has really gotten a tremendous leap from before. I'll definitely go back there. P.S. There're VIP rooms that can be interconnected and it looks really good

Was there with my family of 16 to celebrate one of the family member's birthday. They were truely prompt and courteous when it comes to entertaining our emails and requests. They even gave us a mini birthday cake (upon request) and a little birthday "party" along with it, which was indeed a pleasant surprise for all of us :DExcellent service. Excellent food/ variety. Excellent atmosphere. What more can i ask for :

Chendol is so simple. It comprises only 4 ingredients - the green chendol strands, gula Melaka, santan and shaved ice. Nearly all food establishments in Singapore, from food courts to restaurants, get only one ingredient correct, and sadly it's the shaved ice! Carousel gets all four ingredients right. The strands of green chendol is the right colour, texture and taste - just like what it is supposed to be. The gula Melaka is fragrant, dark and sticky which means that the palm sugar has been labouriously stirred slowly over low heat for hours, whence the fragrance is released, like how it is traditionally done in the kampong. The santan is rich and creamy - first santan squeezed from old coconuts. And Carousel lets you shave your own ice!The chendol in Carousel reminds me of my childhood in Kuala Lumpur - slurping on an ice cold chendol from the Mamak on a trishaw sheltering from the afternon heat under the shade of the big leafy tree waiting for the school bus to go home. Priceless

The Carousel, Royal Plaza on Scotts, provides a moderately priced, high quality buffet featuring seafood and various cuisines. They even have corkage-free BYO for the first bottle of wine. Make sure that you book in advance, because it is a very popular venue with both locals and tourists
5
A place not to be missed when we travel to Singapore. On our recent trip to celebrate our 15th year wedding anniversary, Carousel had made it a special and most memorable evening for us. Always savor the scrumptious choice of buffet and desserts, and most of all, their very friendly, excellent service from Carousel team. Well done and surely will be there again soon :
5
Excellent breakfast choices for every culture. Dinner buffet superb with a good range of seafood. Plates removed constantly ready for your next course, also tea & coffee topped up constantly.
4
Great buffet - huge range, efficient staff. This plentiful breakfast gets your day started right! Get in early on weekends to avoid the queue.
5
Carousel is always my favourite dine in place
Food was good,delicious, awesome and the all staff's are very friendly
Every year it a must for me come for dine in.
5
My best friend n I celebrate her bday there. The staff is responsive and friendly. Love their excellent food too. Super value for $
4
The staff were very approachable, friendly and go all out to ensure that our dining needs are met. Even the slightest things like providing us a small bowl of lemon water to dip/cleanse our hands while dining on shell-seafoods were taken care of by them. They also ensure that our tables are never over-cluttered with dishes and would politely ask for permission to clear them away without having us to call them over. The atmosphere in the dining area is cosy and not very brightly-lit, which gives a 'warm' and chill feeling for diners to take our time and enjoy the food. The seafood section was my personal favourite as the seafood supplies were replenished frequently. The cooking staff were friendly as well, always ready to prepare or serve orders placed on-the-spot. The price for dinner was of course the priciest among all time slots, around SGD72 per pax inclusive of additional charges and it was worth it given the quality of food and excellent dining experience
5
If you are a seafood person, their seafood counter will definitely makes you satisfied. Love e seafood esp e big crab!! Just so big, awesome, sweet-salty fresh taste. Really love it. If you make ur reservation online and u tick 'For Bday occassion", they have special program line up for ur bday girl/boy =) Worth e money. Almost all e credit card/debit card has 10% discount. Try it! =
5
We always come back here for special occasions and when you feel the need the splurge... Food is always good and you are spoilt for choice! Service is excellent with friendly and accommodating staff, keep it up guys. you make the ambience meaningful for us diners! Thank you

If you are thinking of Singapore local food, Carousel is the place. They have wide variety of food that can be found in Singapore hawker centers, food courts and coffee shops. Staff are friendly and helpful. We had a surprised from them too! The staff were cheerfully singing and dancing for the birthday boys and girls! They have brightened up the place. Well done
5
We went to carousel for a friend's birthday and informed the staff of the birthday beforehand. The staff were attentive and helpful and managed to surprise my friend when they presented her with a cupcake, very thoughtful gesture! We were very impressed with the quality of service :) there was also wide variety of food too, fresh and delicious.

Our Pre-school reserved a table for our childcare center Teachers' Day celebration as we heard this restaurant is Halal certified and has an excellent international buffet spread. The buffet spread is good and the seafood fresh. The best part is there is even a Teachers Week draw and the prizes are complimentary lunch voucher. Excellent service and great effort to show gratitude to the teachers by having a Teachers' Week draw
4
We had a family meal and enjoyed the food. The food was fresh and there was a good selection. The fish vans seafood was fantastic. The restaurant was quite busy but did lack atmosphere. Good value for money in terms of Singapore dining.
5
At 68$++ per adult, this place is worth every cent. The seafood selection was great.They have all sorts of cuisines- Indian, Malay, Japanese,Chinese. In addition to that the desserts were heavenly. The staff were great and attentive. Overall highly recommended.
5
The breakfast and dinner buffet spread were so good, spoilt for choices.Carousel at the hotel serve one of the best buffets.
4
Great selection of food from seafood,japan,asian,indian,western etc. All food also taste good. But 1 of my friend said the fruit is not fresh when she eat. I didn't take the food so can't say anything
4
I was informed that this is one of the best sea food buffets in town, and I was not disappointed.The sea food was amazing, the crabs ,snow crabs, prawns, lobsters, mussels and many more fresh sea food were very well displayed and all looked fresh and appetizing. The other varieties of dishes were all good, Chinese, Japanese, Western, Indian and vegetarian. The varieties of dessert from Western and Asian dessert were there for you to sample and enjoy.A great place to meet up with friends to have a fantastic leisurely meal together. The waiters are friendly and empty plates are cleared away very quickly.Birthday guests dining in the restaurant are presented with pretty cupcakes and singing waiters and waitress.Definitely will eat here again

This year, my friend and I celebrated our birthdays together by splurging on Carousel's hi-tea offerings. From their easy online reservation the week before up until we were seated to enjoy the buffet, everything was smooth and seamless. Because of the tip-off I gave to the staff regarding our birthdays, the staff swooped in at the perfect time to hand us our complementary celebratory cupcakes and indulged us by taking a few of our photos with our phones and their iPad.The variety of food is more than extensive even for a Hi-Tea session and I don't think my friend and I managed to taste everything within that short period of time as we kept going back for their fresh seafood. We even referred to their stations as "worlds". So we were pretty much glued to their Seafood World and never really bothered with their Cooked Food World.If you're here to indulge but still maintain a good budget, the Hi-Tea buffet is the best bang for your buck
5
This restaurant would be the best buffet my hubby and I have ever experienced. The selection of food is just so over whelming that we had to go back the next night.. There are around 8 stations all designed around a different cuisine, and if you love sashimi like we do, then this is the place for you. The seafood selection alone is to die for so many crab options..I never knew we had so many! And if your like me and love your desserts than you can only imagine what the dessert bar was like and it has 3 stations to itself!! This is a must if your visiting Singapore
5
I had been to Carousel a few time over the past 5 years. I remember my first time there was in 2008 or 2009.It was a company welfare dinner. FOC! The first time i came in, I got a shock by the buffet spread. The seafood counter was awesome! Fantastic! Last Year, I brought my wife there again to celebrate our 200th months anniversary. This time, my wife was impressed! She was not only impressed by the food itself but also impressed by the service provided by every waiters,waitress, captain and even chefs and kitchen helpers. Why? Because every staffs put on a lovely smile at her whenever she walked pass them.On 8th July was my mother's birthday. This Carousel caught my mum by suprised again! She was shocked by the birthday celebration Carousel had organised for her. She love the food of course, and the service and these lovely picture. I guess she almost cried in her heart as you guys were so touching.As I always say, Carousel is the best Buffet Restaurant I had seen so far and trust me, I have been to many buffet restaurants and none can beat Carousel！ Keep up your good work! May God bless U guys
5
Truly amazing with a great variety. So much delicious, fresh and tasty food, the seafood was especially to die for! Great service, very attendant and friendly, great value for money - will most definitely come back here when visiting Singapore next time! Note: would recommend booking in advanc
5
I have always wanted to try Carousel but have always been hesitant, it is well reputed for being one of the few halal buffets, for having a great variety but also for being one of the priciest. My boyfriend finally brought me here for dinner last night...AND IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I don't know where to start, the service was impeccable - friendly greetings, efficient service - usually in a buffet restaurant you struggle to find the staff but here, they walked around so at anytime you need something, they are there. Our water glasses was never empty, our plates were always cleared promptly, staff was not only polite but super friendly!The food, the variety was amazing but the best part was - it was all FRESH and sooo good. Oysters, lobsters, crabs, sushi, teppanyaki, western cuts, pasta, local cuisine and my favourite, the desserts.. Yes, it was pricey compared to other buffets but the food was of better quality and variety. And the service was one of the most impressive in a hotel in Singapore. My only regret, I should have been here earlier. I will definitely be back
5
The food served were superb with a cool ambiance. Appreciate it when the staffs surprised my wife by singing her the Bday song and also giving her the complimentary bday cup cake. Thank u Carousel.
4
A I good place to have a simple b'day surprise.
Wide variety of international food choices.
It's a HALAL too!
I'd say it's the best buffet restaurant i have tried.
5
have a great family birthday celebration. Food is good and service is excellent too...will come again :)
5
We had a lovely afternoon. Food was really good. We didn't manage to try everything what we wanted. The variety of different dishes is impressing. Restaurant staff is adorable.It's not cheap but considering that you have to book it one month in advance, I assume it's just the price of the market. Try to be there right after the opening when it's still pretty calm
5
we celebrate our wedding hi-tea last saturday, 23-aug. and all of our guests are very happy indeed. not just a simple hi-tea of cake, biscuit & coffee there's a lot of choices of food, from rice to noodle, bread, seafood, salad & up to sweets. we end up with happy face & happy tummy.my guests requested to have one more round of wedding lunch... again... hahahatruly high recommended
5
The food was great especially the service was good and theres even a a cupcake n birthday song n dance performance by the staff for the birthday celebrants. The staff was attentive and their attitude towards service was excellent. Really appreciate the arrangements and the good service. Definitely worth to visit them again
3
On the whole the food is average at best. The best item was the Salmon Sashimi - bit sad that the only thing that requires no cooking was the best part! Desserts were good. Lots of kids running around and it was loud in there, definitely not suitable for a romantic couples evening. We only went because we are staying in the hotel and the restaurant had such a good rating. The burgers we got across the road for $6.50 last night were much better... Seems like it's pretty popular for birthdays; there's a big song and dance, lots of attention and a cupcake with candle delivered to those celebrating.Very poor value for the $53 a head we paid, if this is the 3rd best place in Singapore, I would hate to see the last..

Booked Carousel after many good TA reviews. Went on Friday for my girl 's birthday celebration. My 2 children are buffet fans hence we have been to quite a lot of hotel buffet restaurants. Namely, The Line, Oscars, Olive Tree, Cafe Biz, cafe swiss and 10@claymore and all are in Hotels.Let me say the good about Carousel: YES INDEED the seafood station is the best intern of spread I ever see however do we really eat all types that were given ? My answer is no and I think the overly priced is due to the seafood spread. The Indian food is not fantastic and the fruits station are those easily available in supermarket. Service level is acceptable and they did try their best to accommodate request . As for the birthday song by all the staff and a cupcake could have made the birthday person a surprise but so many customers are celebrating birthday there. Hence there is no exclusivity . The ambience is out for the price , this place is like higher class food court. I was glad at least I tried at Carousel for the experience. Most places I have been ends at 10pm. But carousel ends at 930pm.If given a choice to choose a restaurant, it will not be in my list for the near future
5
Went here Friday night for buffet was absolutely amazing!! Lobster, crab, sushi, carvery, western food, Indian, local. Was first class service. Had a bday for a friens and all the staff come and clapped and sung happy birthday and gave a free cupcake was just so lovely and a an amazing gesture. Took a photo for us and emailed it to me straight away. Cant recommend it enough. Ohhhhh and the 3 dessert tables wow so deliciou
3
I book this Restaurant some time in advance because of TA ranking. The food is really great and big variety of sea food, Japanese, Indian, deserts, etc, etc. The only problem is that you canâ€™t talk during dinner as the restaurant is always crowded and too much noisy. Is like going to a food fair with tables everywhere and people circulating everywhere. For the price we pay I was expecting a different atmosphere
5
There are so many varieties of the food and it is Halal restaurant.
The service is also excellent.
Since it is very popular, do remember to make reservation.
5
Had the 'all you can eat style' dinner buffet one evening and was amazed by the enormous selection of food (sushi, oysters, lobster (yes, lobster as much you can eat..., meats, cheeses, simply too much to mention). Well worth it's money.
5
Carousel....surely a place for warmth and excellent services. We have our Birthday Celebration here today, 21st August 2014. The staff provided an excellent service and will surely recommend to all our family members and friends. Best wishes to our Birthday Girl and thanks to all the staff who are working so hard to make our day
5
Went there last Saturday for our anniversary. Had great time. The spread was extensive. The two waiters who waited on our table were very attentive. Food was good. Paid around 64 per pax. Would recommend if you are in Singapore. You could try lot of Asian dishes
4
I was a little reluctant heading into the restaurant because of my political views but I decided to put that aside and judge the food alone. The restaurant is pretty amazing. Seafood lovers will love the variety of fresh options available - lobster, oysters, mussels, crab and many more.The Japanese section is pretty decent along with it's Tepanyaki offering. The roast section is pretty authentic - the roast beef is delicious and for the Brits, you can have a little bit of home in the form of Yorkshire pudding, which is somewhat rare in Singapore.The lobster Risotto is to die for!!!! The Asian section is pretty good too.The desert is good, with a wide selection of sweets, from cakes to pudding, frozen yogurt to cheese. Overall, a wonderful surprise with excellent service. I went back again a month later for more!!
3
Ok let me begin by saying this place did not meet my expectations.We had a booking for 7pm and as soon as I walked in I felt very over dressed (I was just in a nice dress & heels), I thought it would have been a bit more fine dining but the place was super busy & hectic!.Having eaten wonderful buffets all over the world in places such as Sheraton, Hiltons & Marriott this fell way short.The negatives:The seafood in my opinion was not fresh....the lobsters where definitely frozen as they tasted like water & where tough..the oysters had no flavour.Atmosphere felt like I was at the local all you can eat cheap restaurant down the road. Could at least use tablecloths!Food often coldPositives:Sushi & teppanyaki station was niceOur waiter was lovely & friendly.Overall....would I go there again?...nop
5
I was so blessed to be given the chance to have a celebration for birthday and anniversary at Carousel. The staffs are all very friendly, they are always making sure you have a great time during your meals.They know how to treat the special person of the day with great smile and positive body gesture. Me and fiance was very happy with the food as there give us varieties to choose from and you can always go back to get more.Highly recommended to those who wish to celebrate a memorable occasion
5
I brought my husband here for his birthday treat! The quality of food was first rate - much better than The Line (which used to be very good). However what made the occasion really special was the staff's artistic / fun performance. I will not say more... You will have to see for yourself. I will going again next month to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. Can't wait
4
The wide selection of food really amazed me. It is also very delicious! Every single dish no complains. This is also a great place for celebration as the restaurant provides a complimentary birthday cupcake and the staffs even sang Birthday song and dance to it together. They also took pictures of the birthday gals (3 of us altogether) and sent to my email account the next day! No words to describe the excellent and efficient service. Finally, the staff are very attentive and clears the used plates very fast. Highly recommended! Nanc

I love food hunting and always love to try new places to dine in. Carousel still tops my list as the best buffet restaurant in Singapore! And best thing is, it's also halal certified â˜ºThe variety of food is simply amazing, especially the fresh seafood spread. The food was always replenished on time. Free flow of different types of coffee and tea. Desserts are just delicious. Ambience is great for celebrations or dates with loved ones. They even have rooms for corporate/family gatherings. Excellent customer service where the waiters and managers are very attentive to the customer's needs.My husband and I just celebrated his birthday 2 evenings ago (12 August 2014) with our 1yr8months old daughter. We were provided with a sturdy baby highchair and a kid's plastic cutlery set. They also sang a surprise birthday song for customers who had their birthday that night and my husband received a complimentary cute birthday cupcake. My husband accidentally had a small cut on his finger while enjoying his crab, and one of the service staff actually went out to the nearest Watson pharmacy and get a plaster/band-aid for him. That kind gesture was extremely commendable and appreciated.
4
I enjoyed the wide selection of seafood and dessert.
It is a great place for celebration as the restaurant provides a complimentary cupcake and staffs will sing Birthday song together.
5
A great time coming here for our fri3nd' birthday. I was so excited and surprised at food here. Beef, prawn, fish, local food and western food as well. Staffs were friendly and really happy to bring food to our table as well. Just try it!
5
This buffet had it all - fantastic Asian, Italian and Seafood. Everything was fresh and well presented. Well worth going to Carousel. Have told all my family and friends good value for money.
5
The food was great and the staff were friendly and professional . 5 stars for overall rating. The best service and the best food choices.
5
The overall flow from the entering/checking in of the buffet till the end of the buffet is very smooth. Planned a birthday surprise for friends and the staff cooperated with me and make it a good one.Outcome of the birthday surprise is satisfied and the buffet food are tasty and nice! 1 of the best buffet in Singapore, varies of food for you to choose from and rotation on some favorite food dishes
5

5
We, group of 15, had a great birthday celebration at this restaurant. The manager has sweet smile and very good job personality. The staff are with very fast response to clear used plates. The food, especially the indian foods, are very nice. Seafood spread is wide. Overall, it is worth paying high
5
I'm not a buffet person, as I can't eat a lot, so, If I would eat in a buffet restaurant, it have to be good, I had heard many review on this restaurant and decided to give it a try.The staff at the counter were very friendly, professional and of cause the smile. They have a very unique way of celebrating guests birthday, we gotten a birthday cup cake and they sing and dance, we had a great time, we felt welcome, they took picture for every table and sent it to the guests after that.Foods is just fantastic! Variety spread, fresh and I can assure you, it was the best high quality buffet I ever had in Singapore.I personally recommend this and do remember to make reservations in advance as they are always full.Well done, Carousel team
5
My fourth time buffet dining in the restaurant and more to come. Very friendly and excellence service crew and team. The Birthday performance has improved, compared before. Food getting more variety, fresh and maintains good high quality. No issues for the environment, cosy and comfy for a fine dining. Thank you Carousel and all the team. My friend and I had a great time and good food
5
We went early in the morn at abt 7am.

The staff is very attentive and friendly. From the phone reservation staff to the waitresses.
I am a bit disappointed there is no beef dishes. The dessert selection is great.
5
Great variety of food and service! Celebrated our friend's birthday and was surprised by a dance and complimentary cupcake from the restaurant!
4
Were there for company dinner and really enjoy our food and service there. They are friendly and very helpful. As for the food, its really fresh and a number of variety to choose from. Nice place for gathering.
5
We were greeted warmly right from the start of the whole dining experience. The staff were very efficient and warm. And the food- Two thumbs up! (though it's not my first time). And the birthday surprise for a special one went well, THANK YOU to the Carousel Team. I truly appreciate the effort. I am sure my special one had a good time :
5
Celebrated my boyfriend's (advanced) birthday at Carousel on 4th August 2014. Called up Carousel at 6:15pm to book a table for 2 at 6:45pm and the waiter was kind enough to squeeze us in at the high chair area (near the entrance). We love the high-chair area as it was away from the crowd and we were like having our 'time alone' together. The waiter and waiteress were very attentive with us and they are quite friendly. The food was amazing! Worth every penny! Will definitely come back for more celebrations
4
Really appreciated the warmness and friendliness of the staffs.They are so accommodating!Foods are great especially the desserts! - Love it!Thanks so much for the birthday cake and singing staffs for my husband's birthday, really appreciated it, he was surprised!Will definitely recommend this place... :
5
We had dinner at Carousel with my family and it was so hard to book a table. Luckily it was our anniversary so they managed to arrange us a nice table. The food was tasty and especially the seafood, so natural cooked and fresh. We really enjoyed ourselves here and love to come back again in our next visit
5
Had my birthday treat at Carousel with my family on 3rd Aug 2014. The food was fantastic and everything's fresh, everyone enjoyed it. Great service from the staff. The birthday surprise came with a cute cake and I like the birthday song. The best part was the staff joined and dance to the song. It was really happening. I really had an enjoyable and good family bonding time. Well done Carousel. I will certainly come back
3
Checked-in for dinner buffet. First of all, I must clarify that I am not a buffet person. I am a small eater who prefer fine-dining. ++ Wide arrays of food selection. Fresh seafood. I guess this restaurant will gain higher popularity among those who like buffet style.-- Some cooked food which are supposed to be served hot has turned cold. (E.g. Indian corner
5
Carousel lives up to its reputation. Breakfast selection was good with a variety of food to choose from. Even a simple, common menu like fried rice and fried vermicelli/noodle tasted so good. The staff members were welcoming, attentive and efficient. We were delightfully surprised to see something that looked like Kugelhopf cake among its pastry selection
5
Carousel is one of the best buffet in town. Great food and great service. Has a lot of food variety. Value for money! place is very accesible from Orchard mrt station.
5
We had a great time. The staff are attentive and friendly and the oyster are fresh and w5ill recommend my friends to Carousel.

Not only the food are superb nice with quality. The most important are the staffs (service crews and chefs) there are friendly and helpful. The experience are GREAT!
5
I have been here 4 times and whenever I need to organize dinner with Friends who only eat Halal, this is always the first place that comes to mind. The quality of the food is consistently good. And price is reasonable.

Had a dinner buffet here on weekends and the service was great! Very prompt and attentive. Although there were a lot of people trying to get food, we didn't have to wait for anything at all. Fresh and premium quality seafood :Maine lobsters and Alaska king crab were absolutely amazing !! Not disappointed at all, the lobsters are almost as good as the ones I had in Boston. However, I wish they served butter sauce to go with it.Other cuisines were very nice, too. Desserts are beyond awesome!Try calling if you can't book online:The staff was great and managed to get us a confirmed seat which really made our day as we were hoping to have a mini celebration. (And they gave us a cupcake with a candle, took a photo for us, and send it to us afterward. Nice touch!)Thank you for the amazing experience and we would definitely come back again soon
5
The service of the staff was impressive and they made sure that we felt special. They took special note that it was my boyfriend's birthday and as per the review below, came by with a birthday cupcake and offered to take a photo which was sent by email as well. I thought that added a special touch to our night
4
One of the best seafood spreads I have ever seen! Had a great time at this buffet, service was good, big choice of mains and desserts, The only negative was that we had to pay $16 for 2 drinks which we weren't told that drinks weren't included
5
We had a dinner at Carousel and the staff confratulated my boyfriend for his graduation. They really do take note of your reservation details and they make it special for you. We thought that it was just another dinner but then one of their staff went to our table to give him a cake and even took the initiative to take a photo of us with the company iPad. Immediately after, the photo was sent to my email by Carousel! Amazing food with wide selection and such a wonderful service!Everything was amazing and we had a wonderful experience.I highly recommend Carousel specially when celebrating special occassions
5
On my last visit to Singapore, I made the wise decision to feast at Carousal. It was simply outstanding, a one of a kind extravaganza that is a must for all food lovers. The buffet is well spread out, entailing western and eastern cuisines. Every conceivable seafood item is on offer...for those that enjoy the oceans' finest! Seldom does quantity surpass quality but this buffet is an exception to the norm. I strongly advocate the lunch time buffet but book early, preferably prior to your travel as this place fills up fast. It is also advisable to start early...noon is ideal as the crowd is low prior to 1pm. I am definitely going to indulge at Carousal on my return to Singapore.
5
Heard many good review about carousel and went on to try. We had high tea session, What more can I say about carousel: excellent and am truly satisfied! The service staff are all very friendly and helpful, it was my mum birthday and they even make an effort to get all the staff to sing a birthday song and given us a cake. The price is reasonable given the spread, include japanses, Chinese, local delight cuisine not and moreover there's credit card promo! Definitely returning back to carousel thanks for the wonderful experience
5
Very nice selection of food and the service was fantastic.Ambiance was very pleasant.
Will definitely come back!
4
Enjoyed the buffet at Carousel recently, like the fairly extensive variety of food. Service is efficient and friendly, and they will sing and dance for birthday celebrations!
5
It was definitely difficult to get a reservation especially with my last minute arrangement. However I managed to get a seat after being placed on the waiting list. What a great way to celebrate an anniversary with great food and service..
5
They are the best buffet restaurant I ever had . We came like dozens of time to eat already. Whether or not is any special occasion.
Thumb up and you Guys made it !
5
This is the second time I have had dinner at the Carousel, and I was not disappointed! Fantastic selection, quality and service. Amazing seafood, and the Mediterranean specials for Ramadan were great, too. Loved the seafood croquettes and the Churros with chocolate sauce. Service was second to none. Only negative was we were placed right under the air conditioner which was on full blast, and we were told nothing could be done. Apart from that, a great night!
5
The best buffet in Singapore they say - five years winner in a row the say... Well, had to try it for my birthday and we went with 7 people. From the entrance until leaving just great experience in terms of food and service ! Best and freshest seafood possible, great variety of international and asian dishes and all with a friendly smile. Highly recommendable and worth every cent ... Enjoy !

The numerous awards for this restaurant are not without reason. The Stewart took me on a tour of the restaurant and it took him full 5 minutes to complete his narration of the buffet selection which was truly massive. The sea food counter was amazing with all that one can imagine. They had a special Mediterranean section which was the monthly special along with numerous other offerings in various sections. They charge about S$ 48 for lunch and S$ 68 for dinner and I think it is worth it. Take your time to pick and choose before you fill your plate, there is no way one can sample all the stuff here. The staff are proactive and friendly. If you are looking for a huge buffet with little time then this is it

I and my whole family of 10 persons booked a table at Carousel, Royal Plaza on Scotts for their high tea buffet yesterday on a Sunday afternoon. Occasion is to celebrate my elder sister's birthday, which I had previously indicated to the restaurant staff during the booking process.All of us reach there earlier about 230pm, which the buffet starts at 3pm. At 3pm, all of their restaurant staff lined up at the entrance to greet all restaurant patrons. They also managed the patron queue very orderly, which is to me very impressive.For a typical high tea buffet, the range of food they whipped out is very varied with a great selection of soups, main courses as well as desserts. Not only the variety of food was fantastic, the food itself tastes just as great!! As for the costs we paid, we felt it was reasonable enough, and especially more so due to the bank offer which was ongoing during this period (pay 3, get 1 free).The restaurant staff and servers are all very attentive. Not once our empty plates and cups were left on our tables for more than 5mins+ as they very promptly cleared our plates and cups after we have finished with the food periodically.In the course of our high tea, the servers all marched in in syn to the tune of the happy birthday song, and presented all of those birthday patrons with a cupcake with a lighted candle on top of it. For that brief moment, they reminded me of Club Med's "crazy sign" indeed.All 10 of us in my family (including myself) were first timers to Carousel. We entered with no expectations, but instead left with a very deep and good impression of the restaurant. Because of this, in future, I will definately bring my friends here to celebrate their birthdays or any special occasions, and also to try out their hotel accomodations.Now I can comprehend why Carousel managed to be voted and win the best buffet restaurant in Singapore by AsiaOne People's Choice Awards for the 5th year running. Indeed, it had lived up to its reputation. Keep up the great work folks!

We usually celebrate our parents' birthday at different hotels and somehow missed Carousel. We decided to give it a try yesterday July 20. The spread was awesome and the children enjoyed it too. We were spoilt for choice...too much to choose from and so little space in our stomachs! The pleasant surprise was when we realized the staff gathered to sing a birthday song with a cute cupcake. Dad was really pleased and your staff did a sync dance steps..it was a lovely gesture. We will be back for sure.It would have a been a cosy celebration if we were in a private room setting for 10 pax. I made reservations 2 weeks prior as I noticed the private room had 2 different groups next to our section
4
We came here on the last day of our holiday for the lunch buffet. The food was beautifully fresh and cooked in small batches to avoid the look and taste that you usually get at buffets of food that has sat too long. Great selection and a wide range of ethnic food tastes represented. Fantastic seafood selection. Wonderful deserts all served in single portions so you can try far to many. Staff were unobtrusive but attentive at the same time. Book online to avoid disappointment, when I booked online the 4 days prior to when we wanted to go were fully booked
5
My boyfriend and I visit here during Ramadhan every year without fail. The staff are always attentive and the spread are amazing. We enjoy ourselves with the wide variety that they provide and they never fail to add something new each year.
5
My wife was in seventh heaven with the amount and variety of seafood on offer whilst I was more than happy with the non-seafood offerings. The quality, flavour and very wide selection make this one of the places families should go to dine.
5
Hi Carousel Team, Thank you ! It was a wonderful experience & we enjoyed the ambience created by your team esp. surprise b'day celebration. I could see that smiles were left on their faces on July B'day guests caught by the surprises. My boyfriend too he has his first time celebration in a hotel & never he thought that he could be "eating in peace" hehe.. :D my plan was successful as I knew this top secret and these were relieve of my past memories when I paid a visit to Carousel 7 years ago with my colleagues - better & romantic lol. P/s ok lah the cupcake was tad dry but we love it ;))) Oh ya we remembered that there was a fresh fruit juicing station but we thought it was removed due to abuse by guests or during your renovation. We love to try all kinds of food stations and the nasi briyani was the best. U could clearly see grains and grains with morsels of dried raisins and cashew nuts. Plus 1 for our bucket trip foodie list :D We will definitely come back to find more surprises ya. Cheers 
5
Best buffet if you are:1. Seafood lover (endless lobster, alaskan king crab legs, mussels, etc etc.. you name it, they (probably) have it2. Like to explore and taste varieties as they have dishes from various countries (french, spanish, american, italian, indian, chinese, turkish, russian, peruvian3. Chocolate fountain lover? Good, they have 3 kinds: rose/strawberry flavor, chocolate, and green tea.. have at it4. Sushi, japaneseyou know what, just go.. stop reading this and just go there.. you won't be disappointed (maybe by the price).. but well worth it
5
I don't think there was a Nationality or type of food that was not there. Excellent presentation and quality, so much to choice fromI did not do it justice so don't eat the day before you go and I know you wont want to eat the day afte
5
Loved the overall experience. The service was absolutely fantastic, attentive and quick. Food was tasty, plentiful and couldn't finish tasting the whole buffet. It's my 2nd visit with my partner and we couldn't finish tasting all of the food. But it was so enjoyable, we will definitely come again.
5
I am very impressed with the services displayed by the staffs. The staffs never failed to smile and was very helpful. I was celebrating my wife' birthday during our visit at Carousel. No wonder my wife insisted me to reserve a table to celebrate her birthday at Carousel. My sincere thank to Mr Saravan who had assisted us to have our photo taken. He made us feels warm. Wish him all the best. I will definitely come again to Carousel in future. Thank you Carousel for the cupcake
5
Buffet usually do not appeal to me due to quantity oriented rather than quality. But this time, I am impressed by the buffet spread of Carouse, I would say the price is not costly at all for its quality standard!!! They come in a good combination of east meets west cuisines. Taste is extremely important to me and I love varieties, this is definitely a sure come back place for buffet options. Lastly and most importantly, the ground staffs are fantastic, they do a good job in hosting. I can feel their passion in service line and warm hospitality!!! Keep it up Carousel!!
4
A wide spread of fresh seafood but the other food was average. The service was excellent and staff was very attentive and friendly. It is worth coming back for more seafood! Need to book at least 2-3 weeks in advance for weekend buffet. The hotel's car park is a little inconvenient for strollers and wheelchairs as there is a flight of steps from car park building to hotel lobby
5
The staff was very responsive and warm during my reservation . They gave detailed explanation on menu and proactively suggested complementary cupcake for my mom . But what impressed me most was how the cupcake was presented with song and singing . The staff was also very considerate and helped to pack up the cute cupcake for takeaway . My mom was pleasantly surprised. We had a wonderful night and enjoyed a luxurious buffet. Thank you .
4
Wide spread of Seafood. Overall food is average but service from the staffs in Carousel is heart warming!
5
Excellent variety, must try the seafood bar. Centrally located very convenient for meeting. This is a very popular restaurant so make sure book in advanced.
5
Excellent breakfast for family. Large choice of cuisines. Highly recommended. Good for small kids. Choice of fruits and cereals. You can try one cuisine every day if you stay at the hotel.
5
I had a fabulous dining experience at Carousel Singapore and would like to recommend it to everyone. Amazing selection of fresh seafood ! One of the best restaurants I have ever been to!
3
Came away from Carousel with a 'was that it?' feeling. Yes, we all enjoyed our meals, and yes the staff 'Happy Birthday' performance in front of the whole restaurant for a number of guests was quite hilarious, but our experience doesn't quite fit with the majority of the reviews on this page.Other than the cold seafood selection, the food quality is quite average and in some cases poor. Contrary to other reviews, we did witness numerous non-replenished dishes and the usual negatives that sometimes come with a buffet were present - cold food, massive scramble around dishes, feeling that you are time pressured before they take food away etc.Overall, the atmosphere in Carousel is hectic and scrambled, which doesn't quite allow you to relax. Whilst there is a good range of food and some stations are of high quality e.g. Teppanyaki, the extremely high prices, fairly unhelpful staff and hectic layout ensure that there are many more superior dining experiences available in Singapore and often at half the price
5
Me and my family had a great hi-tea and I had a pleasant birthday spent at Carousel. The spread and food were so good that we were so full after the hi-tea. A big thanks to the team, the surprise birthday cupcake, the pretty photos taken and emailed to me and your great service. I highly recommend Carousel to everyone reading this review. :
5
I read the reviews on tripadvisor and also across a number of the local websites in Singapore. But you always walk into hotel lobby buffets cautiously, so my expectations were not high ... on the most part they disappoint. But not Carousel. Everything we ate was good. The service was good. Staff were attentive. Price was fair. And it had plenty of options for all taste buds.Really worth it. Specially when I compare to other more expensive restaurants offering the same in Singapore. I came with my wife and child, and we really enjoyed it ... I strongly recommend, and I will come back
3
Went with some friends for their high-tea. I was really excited about the visit because i had heard alot about it.In a nutshell, i expected a better spread and the service was just OK, no fantastic.One Good thing about it is a i is Halal. That gets a thumbs up.Let me get more into the food.The spread is a little more than your run of the mill buffet, in terms of quantity and variety.However the quality could have been better.There weren't any oysters during their high-tea and the cuts of sashimi could have been better The desert spread was normal and nothing really stood out.Service was friendly but i didn't see them very much around. I would come back to my table with a fresh plate to see my old plate still sitting thereI am in no-way trash talking the establishment, i am merely sharing my experience from my visit.I hope readers find my opinion usefu
4
Been to carousel a couple of times for different occasions but this time, their service is at its best. They made sure by asking which is the celebrant so they can present the cupcake. And also, the service staff who took the photo for us even asked our opinion and took his own initiative to retake the photo when he noticed some of use with closed eyes. This is what customer service is. Genuine service from the heart.
5
The moment we stepped in, the pleasant memory began. We were greeted by almost every waiters that crossed our path. Background sound of the radio 94.2 FM playing just before breaking fast...just liked home. My 10 yr-old son had a tummy ache just after breaking fast. So grateful to Anthony for his attentive and quick action. The warm lemon drink cured my son instantaneously. It made his night. Icing on the cake, they had a picture taken of my hubby and I, something we never had during all our other anniversaries. Need I say more
5
Went there for my anniversary and had a free cupcake. The food was nice. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the trip very much
5
Very pleased with the customer service, staffs were friendly and attentive. Good spread of seafood. Loved the oysters/ scallops/ sashimi - very fresh! Desserts were a little disappointing though. Not much selection. Overall a great experience.
5
Seafood is fresh! Good quality seafood & variety is wide. Staffs are fast and service friendly ! Price maybe slightly high but for a good quality buffet it worth every single penny!! Had a great night there and will be back again!
5
Been patronising them since their "Cafe Vienna" days and by far theirs are one of the best buffet I've had . There was plenty of choice and all food was of a high quality... Price is rather on a high side tho...
4
Was with here with My family for My birthday celebration. Carousel was very sweet to present a birthday muffin as a surprise to me. And they also sent us the photo they took for us. Very thoughtful.
5
The breakfast buffet spread choices are excellent to feast your eyes. Staff are helpful and attentive to your requests.
5
Having my anniversary dinner at Carousel which we have waited for almost a year to visit.Reservation is a must especially you want to have your meal there, we made the reservation 2 weeks ago, but after a week before i try to made another reservation it was full. Please dont go for last minutes it will disappoint you. Yes undoubtedly the review was real, although they serve halal food, but still a variety of good choices for your to choose from. Bought our own champagne and wines, Ernest the servers was very attentive to our needs, I carry a backpack immediately he pulls another chair from the other seat for me to place my backpack. Service truly outstanding. Variety of food was amazing.Everything was good.Had their salad but quite disappointing with their ceasar dressing with no croutons of bacon bits. the dressing was awful, i bet is from the ready made dressing. Cutleries on the table the new cutleries holder need to maintain like frequently sanitize, i found mine with some brown sauce which maybe is coffee of chocolate
5
A great place to take the family and sit for a few hours in the afternoon and eat. From kids to adults there is something for everyone and unlike a lot of high teas there are a lot of quality items (proper meat dishes) and not just light cakes. Make sure that you skip lunch beforehand and you will not need to have dinner after. Everything is replenished regularly
5
I would like to extend my heartiest thank you to Carousel's outstanding helpful team for making our dinner, Monday 23 June 2014 an amazing and memorable one. This was not my first timer but has been my several dinner occasions at Carousel, be it with my families, friends and business colleagues and/or associates but yet their services remain marvellous and foods spread-up still lingers as perfectly awesome.Carousel providing us with three complimentary cup cakes for our friends' birthday and teacher's a thank you cakes are so sweet indeed...greatly appreciate it.All 13 of us..my teacher and friends have enjoyed each and every moment from the beginning till end whilst dining at your lively cosy well arranged ambience not limited with how sumptuous the varieties of foods being spread and laid-up.My special thank you as no exact words to describe your Carousel Team...in particular; 1) to your reservation team for having us in your "VIP" room which we all loved it and its was an awesome arrangement.Greatly appreciate it..thank you and we will treasure it forever.2)  to your Ms Hana & Ms Mega for your excellence services rendered to us with tonnes of patience and great smile always.Indeed we have so much fun as these were our best dinner ever and definitely will return to dine at your Carousel more frequently with larger groups.On a flip side, Carousel is definitely our first priority favourite place and I would highly recommended to you. Surely you there with no regrets whatsoever.Cheers Carousel and keep up the good excellence service..!!With lots of love from our warm loving heart,Rukilah Dasuki and friends29 June 201

Been there with my hubby for his birthday celebration. Great service and food was fantastic. My hubby was given a surprise birthday cupcake together with a birthday song by the staffs. It was a really memorable experience for me and my hubby. We really enjoyed our time there. Two thumbs up!
5
This place is consistently one of the best buffet places I have had in Singapore! Its incredible, their seafood section is worth the buffet by itself
5
If you're looking for a variety of food, value for money, excellent service, perfect location and a halal certified restaurant; Carousel is the one! There's nothing that I can pick on for this restaurant. Well Done, guys! I'll certainly be back for more!!!
5
I brought my fiance here to celebrate his birthday and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. We've been here several times and we always leave with a fantastic experience so coming here again to celebrate his birthday was an obvious choice. The sushi was fantastic and my fiance kept coming back for more servings of the fresh sashimi. I've eaten at quite a number of buffets and in my opinion, Carousel has one of the best dessert spreads around. My fiance and I especially loved the creme brulee and bread pudding. Service was fantastic, the staff were quick to clear our plates and ensured that we always had a full glass of water. We will definitely continue to patronize Carousel. Two thumbs up!
4
Came and tried their Saturday lunch buffet. The buffet hours are from 12 - 2 p.m. and although we had time to try everything we wanted to it did feel a bit rushed. The seafood selection was fantastic and fresh. Carousel might not serve up as broad of a selection as some other buffets but all the food that is presented is delicious and replenished quick, a definite thumbs up. The only thing that didn't quite fit my expectation is the atmosphere. It felt crowded and loud because the restaurant really isn't that big and all the tables are very close to one another. We felt like we were eating with the couple sitting next to us. The dÃ©cor was also a bit haphazard. Perhaps it is supposed to reflect the Carousel theme but it didn't tie together very well. However, if food is the main concern then it is definitely worth it
5
I was with my family there for my daughter's and son-in-law's birthday celebrations. We all had a lovely time there as there were many choices of fresh seafood and cooked food. A wonderful and joyful surprise when the staff started to sing and dance with a birthday song for those celebrating their birthdays there and they were all presented with a lovely cupcake. All the staff were very friendly and approachable and their services were excellent although the restaurant was full house. Keep it up Carousel !!
4
This is my first time at Carousel. I went there to celebrate my wife and my mom's birthday. We were impressed with the variety and quality of the food. The oysters were very fresh! The staff were very friendly and approachable, despite the full house. We also enjoyed the celebratory atmosphere when the staff broke out in song and dance to wish all diners celebrating their birthdays. Will definitely be back
5
It is without doubt that this is one of the best halal buffet in town with a widespread of very fresh seafood served in diverse styles to suit every palate.The buffet is complete with an international spread of Asian and Italian delicacies, fresh fruits and delicious pastries.On top of this, you are served by very friendly and attentive staff 'round the clock'
5
This is the best buffet restaurant for me & family. Since I introduced them somewhere in 2011, this restaurant will always be number one. The ambiance, food, delicacies, services & many more which are always the best. Best of all, the restaurant served Halal, delicious, great & best food all around. Carousel, you are the best & we will always support you
5
We (hubby, myself and out 2 yr old daughter) went to Carousel to celebrate out 5th wedding anniversary. I am heavily pregnant at 8mths. We were looking for a simple dinner but the staff at Carousel went out of the way to make sure our night went well. they gave us a table that is very spacious and easily accessible to the buffet area, so its not difficult for me to get my refills and they even gave me a cushion so that i can sit comfortable with back support. The food was superbly great. how i wish i could have a bigger appetite if its not for the growing baby that is squishing my stomach. hubby enjoy the naan bread so much and my daughter could not have enough of the fruits and chocolate desserts. I personally do not have a favorite as i love all the spread. how i wish i could enjoy the sashimi and clod seafood but due to my current condition i cant. But this a good thing as this will be my reason to come back to Carousel again.... a definite memorable night. However i do hope that in the future Carousel do consider making a take away menu or at least from the night menu
4
Definitely one of my favorite buffet place in Singapore. Price may be pricey but definitely worth the money. Awesome spread of seafood (happen to be my favorite). We were there to celebrate our friend's birthday and the staff was so warm and friendly. Well done and thanks
5
This place has always been a place where celebration is in.. a very nice restaurant. Its always full pack.. people happy with the food , the ambiance.. thanks for the free pict.. heheheh :) like dinning here so much.
4
The variety of food and pricing of their buffet is great. It's also one of the few halal-certified buffets around, so somehow I always end up here for corporate functions lol. It's also conveniently located around Orchard Road.
4
Has a weekend hi tea buffet. Rather short timing from 3.30pm to 5.30pm. Variety is wide from cold seafood to Japanese to English style scones and pastries to local kueh to Chinese dim sum and indian rojak. Cutlery is cleared swiftly.
5
Food, different tastes and great sea-food. Staff are really quick in service although the busy place.
5
The cold seafood section was so tempting. The crab, crayfish, prawn are fresh especially the oyster meat so fresh, soft & juicy. The ice cream flavor should have more varieties for the children. Should have satay and more food meant for children to eat. Lack of noodle with soup. Service is friendly. Good and convenient location to hold function
5
It's a definitely go-to high tea for a gathering with friends, especially since it's one of the very few halal buffets around. Food is always of good quality and service is prompt and friendly. Variety of food is really good considering it's a high tea. Price-wise, it's a little on the high side but totally worth it for the quality and quantity
5
I have visited many great buffet restaurants in my life time and I have to say that carousel is up there with the best. We really enjoy the quality of the food, the services that is eeesecond to none and the friendliness of the staffs which is commendable, there is really nothing negative that I can think of. Keep up the good work, Carousel is a must for all those buffet lovers
5
My first time to Carousel with my family, young and old. It suppose to be a birthday celebration for my aunt and daughter, however I did not expect the staff to sing, dance and present small cupcakes to the birthday guests, very entertaining and surprising, we all love it.Food wise, it was absolute good for the adults, however I was expecting some fish and chips, or nuggets for the kids, but they are fine with porridge, desserts and nasi lemak.Our plates were clear timely, drinks were filled timely too, excellent service by the staff.Definitely a good experience
4
Me and my family had weekend lunch buffet at Carousel. Quick reservation process. Friendy staff. Good service by each and evry staff. huge buffet spread. Plenty of choices. Best for seafood lovers. seafood, japanease, teppanyanki, salads, cold platters, cheeses, soups, live stations, indian, thai, desserts and much more...i am a foodie... So, i tried almost everything... :D Most of the food was good. But, i did not enjoyed indian much. Indian food was average and. Some of the desserts were too sweet. Complimentry birthday cupcake was not at all good. Overall, food wad quite good. There is only one thing that would hold me back to try carousel buffet again. And, i.e. Seating arrangement. Tables were too close to each other. so, it was too crowded. If you have no problem with congested seating, i would recommend this buffet. Coz, food was good. Bit pricy, but good
5
This is my first time visit Carousel with my family's. I was there to celebrate my hubby birthday. I'm so impressed ... the staff so friendly and the food fantastic. My family's love the food so much. And not only my husband got surprise,I myself got surprise when all staff dance and sing birthday song to all who celebrate birthday on that day. Thank you so much to all Carousel Staff for making my hubby birthday even more special with all your wonderful Birthday Song. Trust me, it definitely means a lot to my hubby..!! I appreciate your warmth and professionalism. I will come again next time.
5
it has to be the best halal buffet in Singapore, international spread of food available.
the service is great too. however it comes with a heavy price :(
5
On my anniversary my family n i having great time at carousel. The foods was marvellous awesome.it has been 2 years in row i celebrate at carousel 2013 n 2014. Thanks a lot for the surprise cupcake. We will come back again.
5
Decided to celebrate mom's birthday at Carousel and it's perfect. Lovely ambience, great hi-tea buffet spread and fantastic service. The staffs even sang a birthday song and presented a birthday cupcake to my mom. It was indeed a very nice gesture and made my mom's day. Definitely worth a visit.
5
The staff at the reception of Carousel went out of their way to get us a table although we were foolish enough not to have booked in advance. When we had given up and were waiting for a taxi to go elsewhere, one of them came running up to us to say that some guests had left early and they had secured us a table! We were so grateful for this as it was my mum's 88th birthday lunch and we didn't want to go somewhere else only to face the same situation. Besides I had heard good reviews of the buffet here previously and the fare here is also considered one of the 5 best in Singapore on one website.The variety of food was good and the quality of most of the items we tried was very high. The service throughout the meal was also very good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone asking me to suggest a good place for a delectable buffet meal. My partner, who's from Australia, thinks it's excellent value for money and my mother enjoyed her meal heartily. Wonderful restaurant to celebrate a birthday. They gave my mum a little cup cake as a token birthday cake and took a photo of us which they promptly emailed to me in 2 formats - as a photo and as a card with Best Wishes. Bravo.Puay Lim Sa
5
I stayed at the Royal Plaza on Scotts with my friends back in December 2013 and December 2012. Lucky that we took the room with breakfast included at the Carousel.Thought we had to join a very long queue for the breakfast but it was worth it. The foods offered in the breakfast buffet are amazing and the ambiance of the restaurant was very unique and interesting. Recommended for any occasions
5
The first time i visited was during a business the food and staff was excellent and good! It make me want to visit again! And yes, I have visited Carousel again on my girlfriend birthday for dinner with her family. Her family and I have really enjoyed the food provided. From Japanese Sushi to fresh seafood. A large varieties of food to choose from especially fresh oysters where you can watch the chefs opening the oysters infront of you. Carousel also made an small birthday cupcake plus they offered to take picture for you to keep a memory. Definitely will go there again. <3<
4
The staff there are really friendly and helpful. I was there to celebrate my mum's birthday and had requested them to deliver the bouquet of flowers I bought together with the cupcake. They agreed without hesitation!I give recommendations for the beef shabu shabu,laksa and prawn noodles! It's definitely a good experience for us
5
Went to Carousel to celebrate my daughter's birthday. When making reservation, staff already asked me if there was a special occasion to celebrate. I was quite impressed. On the day itself, the buffet spread was amazing and delicious. So many things to choose from, from desserts to fresh seafood. Then there was a mass birthday celebration with the all chefs forming a line, singing the birthday song and clapping, followed by the staff serving birthday cupcakes to all the birthday guests. My daughter was very happy. It was an amazing experience! Then the staff took photo of us and sent to my email just 1 hour after I left the place. Thanks, Carousel, for the wonderful time
5
Our friends from Singapore brought us here for our anniversary and it was such a great choice. It's basically a high end buffet, but being from the states, this gave us an opportunity to try all different things that we have not ever had! There is a variety of foods, from Indian to local.... I loved the seafood area and the desserts ! I feel like I tried more things here than on my entire trip ! It always felt clean, and the staff was nice and attentive. We even got an anniversary cupcake to take to the hotel with us. So cut

I have visited Carousel on my birthday for dinner with friends. My friends and myself have really enjoyed the food that Carousel provided. From Japanese Sushi to fresh seafood and to desserts. A large varieties of food to choose from especially fresh oysters where you can watch the chefs opening the oysters infront of you. Carousel also made an small birthday cupcake plus they offered to take picture for you to keep a memory. Definitely will go there again with my friends. <

Simply great! Great service and food was superb. Spoilt for choice! A nice gesture from Carousel to present a birthday cupcake for my dearest hubby on his birthday. Very thoughtful!

And a very special birthday celebration spent at Carousel, with family and a special treat from the staff of Carousel. Thumbs up for the birthday cake and photos. All in all, a great buffet spread in an exceptional venue.
5
This is like the umpteen times we went here for celebrations and Carousel never disappoint me. Food spreads (high tea) were marvellous and yummylicious. We celebrated my hubby's birthday and they gave a surprise birthday cake and sang him a song. Nice surprise.

booked my reservation online & indicated tt it was to celeb my parents anni. Staff followed up w confirmation of reservation & mentioned that a complimentary cupcake will be given. Range of food is really a lot. Various of cuisine. Dessert menu was splendid. Lots of fresh raw seafood. Asian cuisine:korean, japanese, indian, local food. Service was good and efficient. Definitely worth the money

If you love oysters, you can't miss this. Basically I ate oysters and sashimi only. Oysters are opened in front of you. But watch out the 2 waiters opening the oysters didn't rinse the oysters thoroughly after opening. We found a lot, crazily a lot, of tiny pieces of shell in the oysters. We just had to ask for a bowl of water to rinse them before enjoying them..

I had their buffet dinner at Carousel some years back, pre-renovation, and when the price was significantly lower. I don't understand why while other hotels' buffet prices remain close to, say, 8 years back, Carousel's leaped by a rather giant foot. Anyway, it did not stop me from wanting to have high tea there this afternoon. It has a rather spacious and brightly-lit interior, a contemporary and very modernistic design. There is a wide array and assortment of food from different cuisine.After walking a few rounds to check out what was available and taking some photos, I finally collected some delicacies and returned to the table. I started with desserts since sweets cravings kicked in - some chocolate cakes, red velvet cakes, green tea cake, orange chocolate cake and chocolate pudding - all fine and soft and sweet. The sashimi were fresh, as were the shrimps and shelled items. It was a rather good start so far.I finally queued at the station serving Prawn Noodle soup (soup was tasty, but the noodles and vermicelli were rather tough) and Laksa (tasted quite nice but no cockles and not spicy enough). They were tiny bowls anyway, and I had asked the chef preparing them to make the portions even smaller for me.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/high-tea-at-carousel-royal-plaza-on.htm

Foodies all over the world who actually keen on appreciating Asian taste, this is your place. Carousel is really, One of the best Halaal Buffet in Singapore! They have chinese, indian, melayu, japanese, even western in their buffet spread. not to mention they always have AMAZING FRESH SEAFOOD! now here comes my favourite part, the dessert station. i had an unforgettable creme brulee ever in my life. So everyone, please save some space for the desert before you decided to get done!also, we have received the friendliest and prompt service from all the staff. Not one, not two but we had like almost every staff who walk pass our table to wish my mom a Happy Birthday, and of course they gave us a mini cake!. The staff too took a photo of us and emailed it to me.Ps: to A staff named Adrian, who always serve our table with a great hospitality.. (we were trying to open up the oysters our self, he noticed and came to my table and give a plate of fresh oysters opened up) i appreciate the great initiative. keep up the good job

My family and I often have our hi-tea at Carousel during special occasions. Understandably, due to its popularity, it's normally fully booked during weekends & special occasions. The buffet has a wide variety of choice, from seafood to sushi and asian delights. Carousel is also well known for its decent dessert spread. The quality of food is quite good although it may be a hit and miss for some. The service is consistent and the ambience is inviting, although it tends to get a little crowded during the weekends, understandably so. Although the price may be a little on the high side, it's definitely a place worth sinking your teeth in once in a while

i'v always been a fan of seafood and never have i seen such a humungous selection in a buffet restaurant before.. lobsters, oysters, scallops... even a huge salmon was on display... this is perhaps the most exciting dinner buffet i've been to.. their main courses are also of very good variety... japanese, korean, western, italian, mediterranean and local dishes abound and there are 5 live stations too... ... and the dessert... its perhaps the only place with its own frozen yogurt dispenser.. pure bliss... i spent my birthday at Carousel and we were treated to a surprise performance by their clapping groovy chefs...complete with mini bday cakes... and the staff... super friendly... i even got an email afterwards with pictures of me and my friends and thanking me for spending my evening with them.. . overall.. great food.. great service.. I'm superbly satisfied. thanks much for making my 31st bday a blast

If lunch buffet's your thing, Carousel probably has the best international selection for the modest price and superlative service. The seafood spread was impressive with a wide variety of crab, prawn, clams, mussels, fish etc (no oysters, but we were too busy on the other stuff to miss it) and the Japanese section had the usual sushi, sashimi and teppenyaki favourites. Do come with a huge appetite as we were enjoying these so much that little room was left for the other mains. Although the restaurant was fully booked, service was attentive and efficient. Our plates were cleared and water topped up promptly. Minor suggestion for improvement: it would be nice if coffee/tea is served instead of self-service at a remote corner, as it is very tricky balancing cups of hot drinks amidst the crowded restaurant. Nevertheless it has been a superlative experience and we'll definitely be back
5
We celebrated our anniversary over at carousel on 31may2014. It was a great pleasure to receive a little surprise from Carousel team. Love their team effort singing birthday song to birthday babies. Well done team!
5
Had my birthday celebration there with the family. The staff were very friendly and their customer service was excellent. Overall, had a wonderful experience there and will definitely come again for other family events. =) Keep up the excellent work!

Food & ambience was perfect! Delicious..well done n thk u to all d staff for d birthday presentation..it was superb..

their service staffs r gd and attentive to guest. I went there for my wed anniversary celebration and they even prepare a cupcake for us. let us feel very memorable & special. their food r nice too. lots of variety to choose from. we will be goin back again

Had a birthday lunch with family here. Reservations were made well in advance.Although it was a full house, it did not feel that way because of the way the buffet lines were arranged. Good restaurant planning!The variety on offer was good! Most importantly runners constantly topped up the food at the buffet counter.Service was good, and staff promptly cleared used plates from tables.Recommended place to eat. But do make advance reservations.

Dined here last Friday during lunch time with my wife. We didn't make a reservation as it was pretty last minute and decided to walk in. I dropped my wife first and I went to park my car. Noticing that my wife is heavily pregnant, the staff escorted her to the lounge while they were busy setting up our table. Once, it was ready they took her to our table and offered her extra cushion for her back and ensured she is seated comfortably. Kudos to the staffs. The buffet spread was huge and includes a sushi, teppanyaki, fresh seafood, cold appetisers, hot appetisers, soups, pasta section, meat carving section, Chicken rice and Yong tofu section along with Indian and western cuisine section as well. The dessert section had wide selection of cakes, mousse, puddings, ice creams cheese and fruits. Sampled almost all the food from all sections. Everything was above average expect the Indian section. The chicken tikka was charred so much that it was bitter. The mutton kebab was too salty, the daal was over cooked that it was too dry. The briyani was tasteless! Hope they improve on it.Overall, it's one of the best buffets available in the country and really a value for money buffet too

Carousel remains one of the best choices for halal foodies to go to, with quality food - in abundance!The staff are attentive and quick to collect used plates. They also have in place a system for those who are celebrating a special occasion, which shows that they care about the customers.There are many varieties of food available, and I have dined many times in Carousel. I have been on a strict fitness diet as suggested by my trainer, and there is still plenty of proteins available from the selections, especially during dinner.The desserts are to die for as well, and my suggestion is to leave more space for dessert than you would usually, otherwise you will still eat them but feel too sick and bloated afterwards!2 minor downsides though: You will usually require a reservation and walk-ins are extremely hard to be lucky with. The restaurant can get a little loud with the guests talking amongst each other, and it does not reflect the ambience of the hotel it sits at.I find it hard not to suggest Carousel as the number 1 go-to place for anyone with a strict Halal diet in Singapore

Carousel has always been my favourite buffets for dinner with my family and friends. This was my first time bringing my colleagues and there were 19 of us. From the get go, the reservation staff Royce has been very helpful with the bookings and reservations. On the day of the buffet, I made a request to celebrate 5 of my colleagues' birthdays together. I was approached by Karlson to make the confirmation for the birthdays and were told 1 hour beforehand how to plan the celebration together. The wonderful staff came out laughing and singing birthday song and my colleagues were truly surprised. Thank you for making it so memorable. The food spread was amazing and we ate to the brim. The seafood spread is non-comparable and we kept going for seconds, thirds and countless rounds. Service staff and chefs were always so helpful in helping us get our food and our choice of food. Thank you team at Carousel for the fantastic dining experience. This won't be our last time here
5
Had daily breakfast buffet for 5 days and I should say I'll never get tired of the dimsum spread, the congee and the noodles. Auntie who mans the noodle station would always coax me to get and say, 'I guarantee, it's very good' iI's like your mom serving you breakfast - what a way to start your day! I also liked the teppanyaki station for tofu, some veggies and fish. Don't forget to get your own coffee as there a lot (!) of choices in the machine. I also frequented the cheese station and got some cheese, dried fruits, nuts and honey to go with my crackers. Service is efficient and unobtrusive. Overall, I did not regret paying extra for the buffet breakfast during our stay at Royal Plaza on Scotts
5
The buffet is great! My local friend brought me here in this restaurant and I absolutely love it!Service is great! and they have wide range of Seafood selection!Price is standard for buffet across Singapore! But the selection justify the price you are paying fora must try restaurant
5
Our family loves to come to Carousel to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. We love the food and the variety of it. Not to forget the excellent customer service of their staff. We will keep coming back!
5
We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary here, and i must say me and my husband enjoyed the wide array of food, the relaxing ambience and the staff was really very courteous..😊
5
Sumptious fresh seafood galore with a variety of multi-ethnic food choices that left me hoping that I had more tummy space.
5
My wife and I frequent Carousel because of the good food and lively atmosphere. And I will ensure to make reservations at least a couple of before to avoid disappointment and have a good time. That itself says a lot about how much I love to dine at Carousel

I visited Carousel on the back of a visit to The Line @ Shangri-la last month. My first impression of the place was its good service! In Carousel, while the staff at both restaurants were polite, I found the staff here to be more attentive and sincere. The attending staff (I wished I had gotten her name but then again I would have commended almost everyone in the restaurant because everyone was just really warm and friendly!) asked if we had visited before and gave us an overview of the buffet including what their signature items were. This was useful especially since there were several lines of food all over the restaurant. I would also like to complement the staff at the various food counters. It was nice to have them greet you at each station though they didn't necessarily have to attend to you. Hence I was particularly impressed by the service. What was most impressive of all was their care in celebrating the birthdays of all who came to Carousel to celebrate a significant other's birthday. They brought in several beautifully-decorated cupcakes (one for each birthday person) and the whole staff sang and dance for us. This was heart warming and really sweet of them.As for the ambiance of the restaurant, due to the smaller area and the lower ceilings, I found it to be rather noisy and at some instances, I found it difficult to hear what my partner was saying even though she was just sitting opposite me. It was also a bit difficult to move around the restaurant because all the tables were closely packed and I had to ensure that my chair was constantly pushed in if I was not around so I wouldn't block another person (I really won't mind doing that but it reflects the squeeziness of the arrangement). Hence, for a romantic date, I wouldn't quite recommend this place. But for families and friends, why not? (:Of course I have to comment about the food too. In terms of variety, this was definitely less than The Line's. However, I must say that the quality of food was pretty good if not better than the Line's. Simple things like my favorite naan was definitely better here. In terms of seafood, however, I found the Line's to be larger and fresher. As for uniqueness, I found that Carousel offered a number of pretty unique dishes (in terms of style of cooking) which all worked well. So yes, quality there but not so much quantity. The staff recommended the bread and butter pudding which I must concur is really good! I like the touch of coconut (I believe there is?) in it and the fact that it wasn't too sweet. All in all, a pleasant experience! However, I'm not sure if it justifies the higher price I pay here compared to the Line (and a lack of complimentary parking coupons =p)
5
Carousel has always been known to provide variety of dishes at reasonable price. But the best is still to visit this place when they have special menu or promotion. We went during Easter promotion for lunch. There were so many great seafood and the chefs kept replenishing the oysters and lobsters. At $60+ per pax, it was really worth it. I always love their Caesar salad but somehow I didn't see any that day. Nevertheless I really love the food here and will definitely return again soon
5
2nd time dining over here, i'm Surprised! Service's still as good as ever, staff ever as friendly and nice (i.e presenting me and my wife with a cake with compliments to commerate our 5th Anniversary, something totally unthought of in other buffet places). There is such a great variety of food tt you literally have to contemplate about what food you wanna eat before you set off for any of the stations. Try Carousel, Trust me - You Will Definitely Like it and ne Back for More, :
5
Always a gastronomic pleasure to dine at Carousel. The food spread and the ambience are great. Note for muslims; there is also a surau provided nearby for those who wish to break their fast at Carousel during the month of Ramadhan. Just ask the staff about it
5
Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here with the great food and service they rendered. Manager was very attentive and prompt to attend to us.. also seemed to enjoy a litte chat with his customers, which was a rather good initiative. Serve extensive variety of seafood- from lobster to alaskan crabs, oysters- everything was fresh and delectable. Chefs constantly replenish the food so it doesnt stay on the shelf too long hence it's always fresh. Celebrated a birthday there and the manager even gathered his staffs to sing a birthday song. They had some promotion with major local credit cards so the bill came up to about $60/pax. Impressed and will definitely be back again
5
My family celebrated my Dad's birthday here and the experience was certainly great. The staff were all very friendly and attentive clearing our plates almost as soon as we finish and ensuring that our glass was always full with water. The food selection was great too with wide selection which was delicious and the layout was neat, presentable which makes the whole dining experience wonderful. In addition I would like to give my praise to Raja, a staff who asked if we were having a celebration here tonight and when I told him it was to celebrate my Dad's birthday, he ensured that my Dad was given a cake during the birthday song singing. He was certain a great staff who took the initiative to check with the customer which made our whole dining experience great
5
Good food, environment and most important the people working here. Prompt service and friendly attitude is what makes my day. On food, their bread n butter pudding is a must try... will be back definitely. ...
4
they have such excellent service.. food variety is sufficient though i prefer if there's more meat to it. Thank you for surprising my partner and I with anniversary cupcake.. it was so lovely! thank you so much! :)
5
This is the best buffet that I have been too, in my opinion it even beats the best in Las Vegas. I really like the Carousel I have never been disappointed yet both breakfast and dinner.

This has got to be my top few favourite Halal-Certified International Buffet! At Carousel, you're spoilt rotten for great choices of food. Give it a try if you haven't. it serves up a wide variety of Seafood, Asian, Chinese, Indian cuisines and also has a wide spread of delicious desserts and fruits.At the seafood counter, you can find Salmons, Green Mussels, Sweet Clams, Half Shell Scallops, Crabs (Blue Swimming and Mud types), Slipper Lobsters, Main Lobster Claws!!!If you like Meats, they serve up nice Beef Sirloin (Medium Done). Request it from the Chef at the Rotisserie Section.As for Cheese lovers, there are the Blue cheese, Brie cheese, and Fresh Parmesan cheese. Good to go with biscuits!The Desserts are aplenty too. There's the Chocolate Fondue Fountains where there will be lots of people queuing up at to get a dip at the dark chocolate or the white chocolate. There are lots of cakes selections as well.... I personally preferred the Creme Brulee best! The top layer is cripsy and honeyed and the creme layer is smooth.This place is highly recommended for Seafood lovers. By the time you stomach down your portion of the seafood, you may not have the stomach to visit the rest of the counters (which makes up 80% of the whole dining area). If you’re not one, I would suggest that you skip this buffet as it’s more costly than the average Asian cuisine buffets (minus the seafood) – it’s just not worth your buck.For more pictures and details, you may refer to my blog at: http://adriennehoxy.com/carousel-royal-plaza-on-scotts-lunch-international-buffet

The high tea was fantastic and their service is excellent. Food is sufficient, there are more seafood than meat. It will be better if they served more meat items. My boyfriend was surprised to receive a small cupcake for his birthday and with the loud birthday songs the staff sang. It was a really good memorable day for him. Thank you Carousel, you are awesome :
5
We had two breakfasts here and Mothering Sunday dinner and each time the food was absolutely amazing not only in variety but in the flavors and the presentation. Nothing was too much trouble for the people serving us and all the stations were immaculately kept up with fast emptying plates being quickly replenished and everything kept clean and tidy. A great dining experience for us.
5
I seriously do not know where to start. Carousel has given me awesome service from the moment I wrote them them an email to enquire on the dinner reservation until I ended my dinner.I called them about a week back to reserve for a dinner for 14 people on a Saturday (17th May). Seeing its reviews and how popular it was among buffet lovers, I knew I might not get a booking because it would have been fully booked by then. But I was surprised that they are able to secure a booking for me! They also replied to my emails efficiently, usually within an hour. That's awesome service no. 1!After that I dropped them an email again requesting for the state room (a private room for a minimum of 14 pax) but I was told that the room was fully occupied on that day. So I was quite disappointed. But imagine my reaction when they gave me the room when I arrived. I was so surprised I kept thanking the counter staff!! I was so happy!! That's awesome service no. 2!!Food wise is excellent as well. They have a wide spread of food. The seafood are very fresh especially the sashimi. I am a sashimi lover and I personally felt that the sashimi are really fresh, one of the best I've eaten so far. I guess why they are the best buffet restaurant for 5 consecutive years is because of the way they prepare the food. Food are not left there for the entire day. They are cooked at intervals, only when the food are finished. That's why the buffet spread is constantly fresh, hot and they wont turn stale. The staff cleared our plates efficiently too. This is my first time in Carousel for the dinner. Last time I went was for hi-tea. That was a few years back. And I would confidently say that I would definitely return. It is now my no. 1 choice!! Thank you Carousel for giving my family and I a wonderful time yesterday. We will definitely return. Thank you!! :

We've had 3 excellent experiences with Carousel & we're thoroughly impressed. 2 yrs ago, we were Sydney for work & sought to arrange with Carousel a dinner for our parents who were in Singapore to celebrate Dad's 70th birthday. The staff of Carousel was efficient, understanding & made the whole transaction seamless & prompt; gifting my parents a heartwarming & memorable experience! We returned this year to celebrate our Vday @ Carousel - this time with 2 month old baby in tow. We sought the staff for help as we needed to breastfeed our child. There was no suitable space within the restaurant for this to be done discreetly (we didn't have a nursing cover then); the staff again, efficiently & warmly, arranged for us to be in a hotel holding room before the meal. We came back the 3rd time this May for our wedding anniversary with a stroller in tow. The staff kindly & quickly arranged for us to be seated in a spacious corner where the stroller could be placed without being an obstruction & where mommy could feed under a nursing cover discreetly. Thank you Carousel!! On top of your scrumptious food to die for, your service is outstandingly & consistently amazing! We salute everyone of your staff their excellent quality of service, their warm smiles & ever readiness to help. We love you. :
5
I was pleasantly surprised by the birthday cake that was given to me and the rest of the diners who're celebrating their birthdays within the month.With a large spread of local dishes on the buffet menu for high tea is worth $$. Will definitely come again with families n friends on the next occasions
5
Returned here years after first dining here on a previous visit to Singapore.The variety of food on offer, particularly of the seafood is excellent. All items were good quality and fresh. A very enjoyable meal and worth the price.The provision of a complimentary happy anniversary cake for 2 in our party was a very nice touch
4
Wide spread of buffet dishes.. Worth the pennies you're spending on. Great, convenient location too..
5
I was impressed by the service that the friendly staff gave, loved the food (wide variety of choices and fresh seafood) loved the ambience! It made my anniversary more memorable. Thabk you Carousel ^^
5
Had a wonderful 21st bdae celebration there... the food was great and all my guests were happy and contented
4
My second time been to this restaurant after few years break.This place change alot,from outside to inside.Food and atmosphere are there to welcome you.The cold dish counter was the best,from freshly open oysters to Alaska crabs and plenty more..The only setback are the roast item,beef not up to standard,too raw and tasteless.Chef at this counter are too busy to entertain you,even you wait, wait and wait.Deserts well,can fill you up,if you have some reserve stomach space.Staffs are friendly and helpful,except some chefs too busy to notice you
5
We went for lunch at Carousel to celebrate my husband's birthday. The reception staff were friendly and polite and the waiters promptly cleared our plates and refilled our glasses. The restaurant was a full house for lunch so there were a lot of people but the atmosphere was noisy and vibrant but not loud at all. As for the food, there was a variety consisting of seafood on ice, sashimi and sushi, live cooking stations for pasta, chicken rice, Indian food and teppanyaki. There was a carving station for roasted chicken and roast beef with jack potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. For desserts, there were chocolate fountains with 3 different flavours, ice cream, yogurt, cakes, pastries and fruits. All the food that the restaurant offered were very good. The highlight of course was the seafood, but the different dishes served in the different stations were delicious and tasty. I personally liked the garlic prawns at the teppanyaki station and the tandoori chicken at the Indian food station. I had warm chocolate and vanilla pudding for my dessert and they were equally delicious! For birthday celebrants, complimentary cupcakes were given together with a song and dance number from the restaurant staff! Amazing! Truly enjoyed our lunch and will come back again to celebrate special occasions
4
Good selection for older folks and children, overall a perfect place for gathering with yummy food. The sashimi is very fresh, cooked food taste good not been overly oily or salty. The best part for ladies is the dessert selection. Fondue, fruits, cakes, etcâ€¦.. YUMS! Service is reasonable, do not have high expectation when you patronize the place. Do make reservation before walking in as this restaurant is always fully packed
4
We had breakfast here during the weekend. While this place was busy and crowded, the food was fabulous. I've got sourdough, and four cheeses! Fontina, havarti and... i forgot. They had great selection of food to choose from, sashimi was fresh. Empty plates were cleared away promptly. Staffs were friendly and great service.Will definitely come back here
5
When it comes to celebrating... and choices of restaurants to dine in for it... Carousel has always been our 1st on the list... as long as there is still an opening for a reservation to cater for us...And this year being Mum's Bday falls just a day before Mother's Day, we made a reservation via email and the called my mobile almost instantly. That is the kind of efficiency we should commend them for. A great Lunch celebration we had for my family of the ORIGINAL (main family members - mum, dad and us the 4 princesses), with a well spread of buffet... (view their website for latest updates)... and a surprise performance by staff to commemorate the patrons who are celebrating their IMPORTANT day... and obviously Mum was "quietly" overwhelmed by the whole thing... She enjoyed every lil bits of everything that was served... The staff has never failed us... always on the move from topping up our drinks, clearing our used plates and always checking if things are alright... To round it up... it's always a pleasure to dine in at Carousel..
5
After reading the reviews from the other reviewers, i think besides having a great spread of good quality food, they also make it a point to 'wow' their customer with their excellent customer service.I have been to Carousel twice and i was not disappointed.During my first visit, as i was pregnant, one of the waitress offered to bring me some pillows so that i could rest my back while enjoying the buffet. The spread of buffet is good.. the cold seafoods section serves fresh seafood and sashimi, there is a japanese stir fry area with fried rice and some tepanyaki meat, hot food area with chicken rice, pasta , desserts (cakes and chocolate fondue), and cheese cake with a great selection of cheese. the coffee machine serves a great variety of coffee (mild, strong, medium to suits everyone). if you are a tea person, then feel free to order your tea from the waiter ( it is included in the buffet).overall, i would highly recommend this buffet. Nice food, nice staff. Do remember to make reservation as it is usually full, might not get a seat if you just walk in..
5
There is a large variety of food from seafood to japanese & indian cuisine and the amazing cooked food with yummy chilli crab.Was trying to look for some soupy noodles to warm tummy but unfortunately there isn't any.Good services and great smiles from the staff as well :-)Will definitely be back again for more
5
This is my first time coming to this restaurant.The food is delicious and the ambience is very nice.The service is excellent especially this two staff namely Jenna and Mary.They are friendly and always smile.I will return back to this restaurant again.
5
Good buffet spread, a lot of choices. Food is fresh and nice, Very friendly staff, Super service! I will go again.
5
This has been my 5th visit and carousel has never fail me. Since this was an anniversary date, me and my husband were surprised with a complimentary cupcake for it. Staffs were friendly and food, hahaha..what can I say. Simply brilliant(:
5
I booked for a party of 3 and it's mum birthday. Carousel high touch service started from the first moment I've RSVP online, they made a note on my special request i.e. To make it special for Mum. Upon arrival, we are greeted by friendly hosts and got seated within 5 secs, table is all set and ready for us. Food variety is massive, I didn't get to taste all as I am so drawn to the cold seafood spread - crab claws, prawns, mussels etc; it is very fresh too! The hot food section serves very delicious cuisine, and I am not a big fan of Indian food but this place changed my mind, not too spicy or ge-lak, all piping hot and great presentation. The usual suspects like pasta and chicken rice stations are good, the only let-down is the dim sum, cold and missing flavour. But the other meat dishes like rotissery chicken, roast beef and lamb made up for it. The desserts is very good too, by that time, I had way too much already. The food is not the top highlight as most buffet joints do good variety of food, what stood out for me is the excellent service and how attentive are they staff and I like to personally recommend Jasnini, he demostrated positive attitude and enthusiaism. Its the small thing that matters, He brought a bowl of lemon water over when I am busy tackling the crab claws, and constantly refilling our glasses of water (weather is so hot in SG, water is a must!) clearing our dirty plates to ensure dining in comfort; there is also a gentle reminder on the buffet ending. There is a dance performance for the birthday person where every staff member joined in for a dance, adding to the festive atmosphere; and that is why Carousel will be the top buffet choice, most big buffet places lacks the customer touch that Carousel provides. I will definitely go back again
4
My fiancé and I were there to celebrate his birthday. We were supposed to arrive by 6.30 pm, however, his work ended later than usual. It was nice to know that they did not cancel our reservation. The staff at the counter was helpful, especially the manager. It's probably the only Halal hotel buffet I've ever known in Singapore. Been there a couple of times and the experience has always been good. Food, service and ambience are great! A Good place for our collectivistic culture; having a small company dinner, mini celebrations like birthdays, promotion etc. (Thank you for the birthday cupcake. Appreciate it so much.) Couldn't get enough of the oysters! I like how automatic they were at clearing our table
5
Besides serving great food, Carousel staffs are very friendly, helpful and professional. I highly recommend the 2 connecting beautiful private rooms which can hold up to 28 peoples for birthday parties or small ceremonies. I was very satisfied that I chose Carousel to have my ROM ceremony few days ago
5
I've tried several buffet in SG and this is the probably the best buffet restaurant i've been to. They serve a wide variety of fresh , juicy and meaty seafood , sushi-s , cooked food , desserts , there are too much for me to name! Their food is perfect , both cooked and raw. Service wise , two of their staff , Mel and the other Malay guy with his name starting with Y ( didn't managed to get his name) , were exceptionally helpful and cheerful. The other staff of Carousel also surprised my sister with a birthday cupcake after knowing its her birthday tomorrow. Check out my blog , http://mini-escape.blogspot.sg/ , to see more elaborated reviews and photos on the food that Carousel offers! DEFINITELY WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY TO VISIT

I had made an reservation at 2030hrs.. after many times of asking the front counter staff, we only manage to get our table at 2055hrs.. and so what is the point of making reservations since we still need to wait eventually?? and as it was meant to be a birthday celebration, i requested to have the cake served after our desserts, the cake ended up being served way before our desserts.. and the serving was different from the past. I came last year, de service crews will gather and sing "birthday song" to the birthday ger/boy. Now there is no surprise and no birthday song. I am utterly disappointed with the delay of getting our reserved table and the special arrangement

We had an amazing dinner at the Carousel restaurant. Not only was it the best display of seafood, both cooked and raw the other several stations were all equally as amazing in quality.I have never seen such variety. The deserts were fantastic.We also had breakfast here for 3 mornings and I don't think I tried everything on offer. Awesome they cater for all. I cant fault them as busy as it was, the service was very good

My family and I went there to celebrate my daughter birthday on last Sat (03 May 2014). This was the first time we visit Carousel as my friend intro me, and I can say it’s a brilliant choice.The food spread was a “WOW” to me, so lots of choices.The food was fantastic, especially their seafood on ice (it was so fresh). And their dessert was so yummy!I can say their service was really great. When we enter the restaurant we were greeted by all the staff.They even provide a complimentary cupcake for my daughter and sing a birthday song for her.My daughter was so happy and surprise, keep on telling me “next time we should patron again.” =DMy husband and I had a great time over here. Thanks Carousel for all the service provided by your kindly/friendly staff that you have.By Gowr

Good service, good food. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your spouse. Whatever the occasion, it's still a good choice. Been there several times and the service from the staff have never disappointed me.
5
Buffet spread was one of the best...love the fried beef with spring onion, naan, fresh seafood, oyster, dessert was yummy and the selection was great.
Service staff was attentive
5
Nice ambience and lovely food.. Great service!! I would like to say my thanks to one staff, Mathi for the great service.. Thank you Carousel and staff!!

Was there to celebrate my wife birthday. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent.
They even provide a complimentary cupcake for my wife and sing a birthday song for her.
Thank for the memorable sweet surprise.
Will definitely visit again.

excellent spread of asian, indian, mid eastern and european cuisine. sushi and desserts should not be missed.

I consider myself a food connoisseur and take pride in it. I have been very critical of restaurants that offer buffets in the past, as I feel most compromise quality for quantity and vise versa. Just when I thought Carousel would fall trap to the same principal, it shocked me with the contrary. The quantity and quality of food was "TWO THUMBS WAY WAY WAY UP." An exhaustive choice of seafood, poultry and red meat, all of which was cooked to perfection and rich in flavor and taste. A special kudos for the starters and deserts which were mind blowing. This is one place I highly recommend all visitors to Singapore must try (book in advance as it fills up fast). The cost per person is approximately 74 bucks...worth every dollar as you're paying for value. I am definitely visiting Carousel on my next visit.

Was there to celebrate my husband birthday. Must compliment that the service staff was prompt & friendly. Was quick to clear our table full of plates and top up ice water. There's even a bday cupcake for my husband and when he's too full to consume it immediately, one of the lady staff took the initiative to doggy-bagged it for us. Such attentiveness! The corner that was given to us was perfect for a baby stroller that I needn't worry someone would bumped into in the busy restaurant. However, the construction ongoing outside was not too easy getting around after you've parked your car. As I also brought along my MIL in her wheelchair, we had to walk one big round to the front to get to the hotel entrance. As there was no ramp to get the wheelchair up, one kind Indian doorman got another younger Malay staff directing traffic to help lead us thru the back of the Conceirge or Reception towards the restaurant which was a long walk where we had to avoid the rubbish collecting wagon, wrestled through luggage and finally out to the front lobby. But the staff willingness to lead us minus out any confusion & frustration. Kudos to these 2 gentlemen! So overall my experience at Carousel was a positive one and I would love to go back and savor their fine delicacies again...hopefully after the construction! ;

We had a birthday celebration for our 2 colleague . The service was GREAT. When we enter the restaurant we were Greeted by all the staff.The wide selection of stations with seafood & Asian cuisine that suits us. When all the staff sing and play the songs for those Birthday's girl and boys it was so GREAT. All of us have Great Fun.......
4
The food was great & the staff were so friendly and efficient esp Seri, Ernest & Mathi they were helpful..The food taste great and the spread is awesome.. but the duration of the Hi tea is rather short coz there is tooooo much to eat!! While giving out d birthday cakes is commendable however the singing of the birthday song is only concentrated on the living room area it would be great if all those celebrating their birthday would congregate at the same area ao that they could witness the song performance. Overall it was a fantastic experience & will def come back!
5
I would like to complement Karlson Kim (CRM) and his team for their excellent service and in arranging a birthday surprise for my husband! We truly enjoy the wide selection of food and desserts; great ambience and excellent staffs.I will definitely be there again!Thank you!!
5
Really like this place. Food is good, so is the service and staffs. Staffs always so friendly and willing to serve. Now they even go further by taking photos of us and sent it to my mail within 2 hours of my visit.
5

The selection and quality was amazing! The buffet has great selection of sea foods, indian food, Chinese food and all kinds of salads, cheeses, western food selections and of course the overflowing desserts. The staff were so nice. Place is beautiful and elegant.

Excellent food and extremely friendly staff! Went for the high tea with my Mom and sister to celebrate my Mom's advance b'day! (They surprised my Mom with a cupcake) The variety of the food was awesome! I totally enjoyed the desserts! From the pastries, cakes, bread pudding AND THE FONDUE (Main highlight for me!) They had 3 flavours to dip your preference (Marshmallows for me) Rose syrupChocolate Green Tea (The best)The staff was extremely friendly! Thank you to Jenna, Arnold, Saravanan and Dora! :) Of course everyone else too! Serving with a friendly smile! 10/10!
5
The service was fantastic! I really liked the cupcake they provided my husband and I for our anniversary. They also took photos for us and then sent a lovely email which included the photos. We have never experienced such service. Very warm and welcoming. The food was great! I have had both breakfast and dinner at the carousel and there has always been a great variety of wonderful tasting food. Definitely value for money! Will be back again.
5
It's not my first time here, but everytime I come here, I never fail to be amazed by the service extended to me. Very attentive service staff. The staff will sing and dance for the birthday gals & guys, and handing out cupcakes with a candle to them. A good spread of food with great variety. If you're looking for halal buffet, you shouldn't miss it
5
It is not the first time for me at Carousel, and it sure wont be the last! During my recurring visits at Carousel, I have made acquaintance with some of the staffs and the chefs. Particularly Chef Robert, who never fails to provide my guests and I some amazing service and guide to all the buffet spread. It is particularly the hospitality provided that made me return again and again to Carousel! And not to mention, the fresh seafood (oysters and lobsters were my favourite!) The indian food section (The garlic butter naan was heavenly!) the grill section (so many choice cuts and sauces to go along with it!) etc... Too many good factors to mention. Cant wait to come back to Carousel. Thank you for the amazing dinner experience
5
We had a birthday celebration for my mum on Easter Sunday brunch. The wide selection of stations with seafood & Asian cuisine that suits our parents, spaghetti that the kids like & the rest of the food is just great! As I am pregnant, the staff bring me a cushion to support my back. Thumbs up! The birthday song & cupcake presented by the hotel for my mum make it a memorable one.
5
The choices included Indian, Oriental, and English breakfast. An outstanding way to start your day. Did not use the restaurant for any other meals, but I would assume they are also as good.
5
breakfast buffe was many choices, great taste. good service. nice restaurant and very comfort. try the noodle stand, it has delicious taste
5
Carousel buffet is very popular. One of the few certified halal buffets in orchard road.
Must book or else you wont get seats
Service is good and friendly
The buffet spread is good and food quality is very good
5
Carousel has Really the best high tea in town.
Never fail to impress me and my family .
Food and service excellent !
Love it. Good job!!
5
I went there with my family to celebrate my son's birthday. The restaurant gave us a fantastic experience with a birthday song and a cup cake. Did not expect it. The food is good and the service is excellent. There is an Indian food corner which I wish they improve on quality. Rest of the sections were very good. No shortage of items any time
5
If you are looking for quality halal buffet place...this is the place. They provide good quality too in terms of keeping in touch with you if you made reservation and cater to your needs for special request. And what is a trip to Carousel if you don't eat a dallop or two(or three hehe) of their sinful bread and butter pudding
5
Make reservation on 30th Dec 2013 for birthday lunch for a friend of mine who's turning 33.He was surprised when a group of carousel staff sing a birthday song & came with a lovely cupcake towards our table. After which they proceeded to help us to take a picture. All the service staff is friendly and awesome! Wide variety of foods. Im loving it.. Will surely return.. :
5
My fiancÃ© brought me to carosuel for my birthday treat! Because we made reservation, we were warmly welcomed with very personable service.. and then it was a pleasant birthday surprise and following that was beautifully taken photo sent to us the following day!!! Excellent service, great food and fantastic experience!
5
A team anniversary event for my supervisor and colleague made special by the staff of Carousel. We were given thoughtful cupcakes and a picture of our whole group. And the food, awesome selection of fresh seafood and international buffet.Not my first time here yet Carousel continues to suprise us with its excellent service attitude. Thank you.
4
We reserved for 33 pax after our solemnization. Their service was v good from the start as they bothered to ask what occasion it was etc and even gave a cupcake to congratulate our marriage. It was a very nice gesture. They gave us 3 complimentary parking for us, but it would be good if they could provide complimentary coupons for everybody. They had a large variety of food. Our family enjoyed the food very much
5
Very enjoyable my dinner at Carousel. The food is fresh and various of choice. Staff very friendly and excellent service.
5
My li'l girl and I had a cosy high tea celebration for her birthday and as she tells me, it was the best surprise ever with the pretty celebration cup cake, singing performance, delicious buffet and warm service. Thank you, Carousel!
5
The reviews dont do it justice.
The food selection were enormous with fresh food all around.
Only better to get a reservation early for dinner as it is jam packed!!
4
Excellent choice of cuisine and hallal very good value, but you have to book in advance, Selection western eastern, south eastern and very good deserts, innovative and good ambiance
5
Excellent choice of breakfast with great service. Courteous staff.................... ...... ..... ...... ....

I brought a friend to celebrate her birthday. When I made the reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion, and that they will present the birthday girl with a cupcake at 8pm. From the moment we reached the restaurant to the end of the night, the staff were all very attentive and friendly. At 8pm, all the staff put down their work, lined up, and sang a birthday song for all the birthday people, and presented to each one a cupcake!Not to mention the food was excellent, especially the seafood, it was SO fresh!All in all, a wonderful dining experience! Well recommended
5
My family had a wonderful time at Carousel. The warm, friendly & excellent service of the Staff are really appreciated. First time we see staff singing birthday song n dancing to the tune n giving cup cakes with candle for the birthday person. You made us so joyous n we wil never forget this moment. Thank u. n my heartfelt wishes to each n everyone of the staff for their excellence
5
I must say, from the time i called to make a reservation and till we dine in at Carousel, the staff's services are very good! I won't forget those happy moments of 2 of my friends B'day cupcakes surprised! They were very happy! Thank u for making it happened! And thanks for the photos too! Sweet memories, delicious food, great dining restaurant & services! I would surely recommend Carousel to others who love to eat! Awesome
4
Had a birthday dinner there for my significant other. The food selection was fantastic, totally worth the it. The staff was wonderful, and very attentive. Plates were cleared rather quickly. Special thanks for Karlson who made an effort to interact with us. My significant other and I felt all the more special and welcome because of him. Wonderful place, with an even more wonderful person for a special occasion. He (my significant other) thoroughly enjoyed himself there. XOX
5
We have the best celebration for our boss birthday last nite. very one of us enjoy the evening. the foods are good and the best is the service from your service staffs taking care of us the whole nite. We love this place, sure to return
5
What a memorable moment having high tea meal wz my birthday wife. Food was fantastic & tasty, especially the seafood prawn & crabs. Will come back again for any special occassion.
5
Service is excellent. Large variety of good food. Prawn bisque is absolutely delicious. Birthday song is sung to us by all members of the staff. Birthday cupcake given. Photo taken and emailed on the day itself! Superb. Enjoyable. Worth it!
5
I have been to Carousel few times and the service is always tip-top. It makes my day a splendid Sunday. A good place to bring your loved ones over and have a great meal. Thumbs up!
5
The food was amazing and the atmosphere was amazing. Suprised by the birthday song with all the staff joining in. It was an amazing exprience.
5
Not my first nor the second it's been numerous visit but still the hospitality was superb and the food was marvelous. This time round brought the whole family to enjoy what I had been enjoying that is the food served... Thumbs up!!!
5
Requests were well attended to. Excellent freshness of food with widespread selection. Great place to be for value for money and tummy for their dinner spread.
5
Having flown to Singapore to celebrate my birthday with the loved ones, I truly enjoyed the moment at Carousel for the lunch on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday - upon a 2-month booking in advance. All of us had our own favorites and went for the second serving. Tasty and gastronomically satisfying, indeed. The staff members were genuinely friendly, attentive and efficient. Birthday song, cupcake and photos are an excellent way of delighting us. Good job to all and keep it up. We will certainly make a reservation again in the future
4
That is what you'd experience in Carousel the moment you enter the restaurant. Cheerful, ever-smiling staff will show you to the table, plates are efficiently cleared, drinks promptly topped up, coffee/tea served, requests quickly attended to - all these done in a discrete & non-intrusive manner.Kudos really to the service staff for making our every visit enjoyable & memorable
5
If you read a trip advisor review from someone who finds fault with this restaurant then do yourselves a favour and ignore it!! I celebrated my 60th birthday with a girlfriend here on March 18 and it was fabulous. Special birthday cupcake delivered to your table and staff sing happy birthday to all those celebrating. You really are spoiled for choice. The buffet breakfast is absolutely sensational catering for all nationalities. There is so much to choose from; fresh fruits, cereals, yoghurt, different bread & jams, eggs of all descriptions, tomatoes, hash browns (no bacon), freshly (on the spot) cooked omelettes, waffles, pancakes, danishes etc. etc. Numerous accompaniments for whatever you choose. Huge array of asian foods also. You can fill yourself up to the point of really not being hungry for lunch. Breakfast finishes at 10am and service is great...constant tea & coffee being offered
4
We recently had the lunch buffet at the Carousel and really enjoyed it. I am a vegetarian and often find it difficult to get tasty food with some options. But, I found the selection here more than satisfactory and everything that I tasted was really good. There are many options from which I chose some from the Middle Eastern section, some Continental food, some salads . There was also a small selection of Indian food (that I did not try) The desert section was good too. I would recommend the mango flavoured frozen yogurt
5
Great variety of food presented very well and all very tasty. Catered to all tastes with a variety of Asian, Indian, Japanese and European foods available. The juices were all freshly squeezed and the fruit was very fresh.
5
Very impressed with how each set of diners were escorted to our respective tables. It's something unique to this eatery which I've never seen happening in other places. This is what we call 'service that other people talk about'.
4
great food and not too bad service.
Quite expensive buffet which could really be dropped in price a little.
5
We came here for dinner and was happy. The food with many choices, we especially enjoyed prawn and wine here. Great atmosphere and people. Should try it!
5
For times, I always get the satisfaction I am looking for in a buffet. I love seafood and their spread is just undeniably more than satisfying. Worth the amount you will pay and friendly staffs are just so nice! Will keep on coming back here.
5
Dining experience was excellent. The price you charge for kids is a bit high. Should lower the price for child buffet or increase the age from 4yrs old to 6yrs old as I don't think 4 yrs old kids can eat that much. The birthday cupcake presentation was so entertaining. Thank you so much for the memories!
4
Not the 1st time here... Been here so many times and everything seems to be consistent. Excellent selection of food suitable all dietary preference. Fresh sashimi and seafood. Tasty and savoury dishes. Dessert selection was equally good. Would strongly recommend for lunch and dinner buffet, but you need to make reservation
4
If you love seafood buffet, especially cold spread. This is one of the better choice. Most importantly is a place whereby you are able to dine with Muslim friends. Serve tasty and fresh sushi, sashimi and cold noodles. For people who prefer cooked food wide selection of east and west.Reservation is compulsory as they do run on full house most of the time. I tends to book at least 2 weeks ahead especially for weekends gathering. Price is on a little on the high end but worth it. Dinner will cost approx. $78++ per pax and $10 cheaper on weekdays.Do check for credit card discount. Discount about 10 - 15% depending on type/bank of credit card charged
5
I celebrated a special birthday at Carousel as I had 1 Muslim friend. There were total 16 of us so the restaurant kindly let us have the Stateroom. The food is even better than the previous time I ate here (a year ago?)! I don't usually like prawns but they were so crunchy and fresh that I had 2 serves! There were the freshest oysters ever because the staff only opens a few at a time and waits till they are almost gone before opening more. I also had 2 serves of lobsters which were delicious! I was in seafood heaven! Only the crabs weren't as good - maybe because it was close to a full moon? My favorite sashimi never failed to please too. The tandoori chicken is worth a mention too. Their desserts were also plentiful and we all loved the ice cream best! All in all a most enjoyable dinner and a great place to celebrate any occasion or none at all! I will be back - again and again
4
It was the 2nd visit for myself and a definite visit again in future. Brought 3 other colleagues of who are all first timers and 1 of them departing Singapore to her homeland in Philippines by the end of this month. They are pretty impressed with the layout and display of the place and the food.Variety of food is well balanced and delightfully assorted. Quality of food are beyond expectation.Exceptionally fresh seafood. The desserts are tastefully out of the world.The ambience was mellow and the warm reception of the receiving staffs are being made personalised. However, some crew members does seem to be not so generous with their smiles.Otherwise, it was a pleasantly tasteful and enjoyable gastronomic experience. A definite choice for myself and fellow friends if the decision is to go for a buffet.The Carousel team made the dining experience pretty much personalised and warm service, from the time the online reservation is made. Outstanding
4
We were not informed it was Malay themed and everyone was looking forward to a good range of food. For dishes which are easily available at hawker centres, it kinda defeats the purpose to pay that much for local delicacies.
4
If you on holiday in Singapore..n try to find the Best Halal Buffet...so you must try Carousel. It serve variety of cuisines, featuring variety of sweets with many dessert counters.
The services is good.
4
We have our department year-end dinner at their VIP room. The food is really good with great selections, what I really like is the seafood area, thumbs up to the lobster :)
4
They serve fresh food and the replenishment of food is very frequent and fast though is a little expensive.
3
Ok place especially for halal diners. Food is fine. Seafood is good. Good fuss made for guests celebrating a birthday. But desperately needs a refresh - seats all cracked and peeling.
4
Wide variety of food , lots to chose and quality is good . Hot food items are generally better than the cold ones . Dessert selection is fantastic
4
Worth for paying...celebrate birthday lunch with family, lots of fresh seafoods, Japanese and Turkish cuisine and lots of various different ethnic groups food served to your great delight. Different variety of drinks, cakes, deserts are placed for your easy reach. Weekends are crowdd so bookings must b made in advance
4
I make it a point to have my annual family year end/new year buffet lunch at Carousel. The selections are very good and fresh. We especially enjoyment the cold selections, Japanese preparations and deserts. The price they charge is just right given the wide choices of food
4
Money for value, lots of fresh Snowcrab longlegs, crayfish, big prawns, sushi n salmon and lots of various different ethnic groups food served to your great delight. Different variety of drinks, cakes, deserts are placed for your easy reach. Weekends are croweded so bookings must b made in advance
5
One of the best halal buffet in town ...fresh seafood , gd service n variety food served .located near orchard road royal plaza hotel(scotts road) this restaurant have won several award for their buffet .Price is ok for me for the dishes they served ...worth all the cents you spent to dine at carousel
5
been there twice.. first for dinner, second for high tea.. large variety of food. personally like their dessert n cakes section.. although its quiet expensive, it is worth spending.. one of my highest rated restaurant..
5
We've been to this restaurant for more times than I can remember - with family, with friends, with business clients. And all of them came out very happy! Hence, enough said!
4
The various choice of food is good and fast refilling as well. Great and fast service. Very awesome and delicious food they have.
5
Super duper awesome! I have been there for dinner & high-tea for at least 5 times and will never get sick of the food. Worth the price! The deserts are the best in town. Great ambience.
5
My favourite Buffet restaurant in Singapore.
Although quite pricey, they serve wide spread of halal food, classy coffee from capsule coffee machine. Food is always replenished and service stuffs are very attentive.
4
Good Selection of Seafood and meat, seafood is fresh too.
Need to make reservation arrangement or you might not get seats.
As is Hala Buffet, very suitable for doing staff dinner
5
An incredible buffet with all the food and deserts you can wish for!I went for the lunch buffet and was impressed by the many different types of food and all I tasted was delicious! Each section has its own chefs to make sure nothing runs out and constantly make new food for the buffet. If you are only 1-2 persons and want to make a reservation when everything is booked, ask if you can sit at the tables at the entrance. I was offered to sit here and had no problem with the seating.Previous reviews have given critique on specific seafood, but I suppose this has been improved as I only had delicious salmon, sushi, crab etc. Prices listed on the website include both water and hot drinks and waiters are very efficient at removing used plates, refilling water, offering hot beverages and make sure guests feel fine.Try it out
4
I have been to couple of times in Carousel. There food spread is excellent and it's halal! I always look for variety items in appetizer and desserts. Carousel is the best place for those. It is a famous restaurant that's why it's always very packed. Need to book in advance
5
I can never get enough of Carousel. The service is impeccable, the chefs will never hesitate to help you (if food is new to your palate, that is) but most of all is the food!!! Upon entering you will be greeted with their Japanese counter and their cold section. This is only the beginning. If you are into greens, the salad section will be a good place to have your selection. Don't forget your mains, a good handful of selection from different cuisines. But for me I will always always go for the desserts. Don't worry you will walk off the food you ate by going through all the many rounds of food to indulge in. :) Yummiest place with appropriate prices. Oh by the way, reservations are always a must as they are always full and I have been placed on wait list on many occasions. This is a must go if you love buffets.
5
Fresh oyster, mussels, prawns, scallops, etc for starter. I always have my buffet here for every occasion that I can have. The restaurant have a lot of varieties of food and pastries as well. Be it local or international food. I usually go for the bread pudding. The staff is also very friendly and they will make an effort to perform a birthday song for those celebrating their birthdays - not necessary to fall on that day. Plus getting a complimentary cupcake too and photo taking as well. I will recommend this restaurant for tourists or Singaporeans. It may be very pricey but worth it. Make sure you make a reservation before going. It took me at least a month to get a table.Kudos to the team
3
The seafood has no flavor, the Sushi is thawed (also no flavor), but there is a lot of variety of dishes. The price is too high for the value offered, in my view.
5
Great value and a wide buffet spread. Went there for lunch. Better value. Eat till you drop. Worth skipping breakfast for this.
5
Had dinner over at Carousel. The staff were efficient, friendly and service-centric. Variety of food to choose from. Atmosphere is just wonderful! Honestly, Carousel has always been my first choice when it comes to celebrating that special occasions. It can nv go wrong!
5
Excellent service and staff are willingly to help and prompt service at any given time. Food was lovely and a wide variety. Desserts were my personal favourite I could not get enough of it. The frozen yoghurt was soooo good.
4
It was a very good experience for me and my boyfriend. There was a lot of varieties of food and desserts. I was especially satisfied with the dessert section which was my favourite. As my bf and i were celebrating our anniversary, we had received a complimentary cupcake. I was glad that my bf was pleasantly surprised. Though the price was expensive, it was worth it. Their service was good and they had cleared our empty plates promptly. Overall, i am satified with my experience there.
5
It was truly a rewarding experience for us at Carousel for my husband's birthday. The service staff (each and every one of them) had always a smile in their faces and served all the guests with so much warmth. Their mob flash dance as a birthday surprise for those celebrating their birthday was a great one! All thumbs up for such great service & customer experience...RegardsRichelle Hoga
5
We stayed in Royal Plaza on Scotts and we add on SGD10 per pax for breakfast buffet. This restaurant is always busy, however, the staffs are well versed with big crowds, hence, we didn't need to wait for long for a table or to grab their attention. The food on buffet were top quality. They offer western breakfast with egg station, Chinese steamed dim sum, porridge with some local food like noodle soup, fried noodles and nasi lemak with japanese corner as well. Huge variety of fruits as well as lovely pastries that are worth a try. The staffs working there were efficient yet courteous. Having breakfast here is a great start for the day
5
We had our son's birthday celebrated here on 1st March 2014. That wasn't my first time dining at Carousel. Been there on many occasions. The birthday presentation was great. Friendly & helpful staff with ever ready smile on their faces. The HiTea spread was great. I love the ambience. Thank you Carousel! Highly recommended
5
We had dinner on 02-Mar-14 at Carousel to celebrate my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary and I am happy to say that we enjoyed our time there. The food great, the service given was great. The birthday cake presentation was so entertaining and my gal loves watching it. Thank you so much. Jennife
5
We had dinner on 01-Mar-14 at Carousel to celebrate our parents' birthday. I am happy to say that we enjoyed our time there. Not only was the food great, the service given was top notch - from the friendly people who welcomed us at the entrance to the nice gentleman who was in charge of our section to the lady who arranged for the birthday cake and the birthday presentation.... everyone was amazing. I would like to thank all the staff of Carousel that night for making our parents' birthday dinner both enjoyable and memorable. THANK YOU!! sincerely, zizi azali

5
Definitely my favourite buffet dining restaurant ever! Even my Thai guest said its even better in quality and spread than in Thailand.No regrets,and staff were all ready smiles faces! Thanks guys! :)

4
Overall food selection is good but more cakes choices should be included...service is commendable...
5
definitely the best buffet! you'll find every cuisine here and the quality of the food is exceptional. the seafood is definitely a favourite. i come here every time i visit singapore
5
We were a group of 11 persons and were warmly greeted by the Malay staff who paid great attention to us all night. We were given hints on the special food available and our used plates were cleared efficiently. Fantastic night with a fantastic group... Thumbs up for the freshest seafood with copious amounts to fill you up and satisfy a year's load of seafood cravings
5

5
I wanted to surprise my wife with a 10th Anniversary celebration for her at Carousel. I was not disappointed in any way. The food quality was awesome. The variety is very wide, from chinese, Indian, Mediterranean, Seafood, Japanese, etc.... My wife was surprise to see a staff carrying a small cupcake with a lighted candle to our table and said "Happy Anniversary Sir & Mdm". I was not expecting all this.....One of the staff even come up to us (without asking) and took a picture of us and send it to me immediately by email. Excellent. This made our day and money spent all worth while.Excellent job Carousel team.

My wife was surprise to see a staff carrying a small cupcake with a lighted candle to our table and said "Happy Anniversary Sir & Mdm". I was not expecting all this.....One of the staff even come up to us (without asking) and took a picture of us and send it to me immediately by email. Excellent. This made our day and money spent all worth while.Excellent job Carousel team. 5 stars to All of you guys

This was the 2nd year me & my family celebrated our loved ones birthday at Carousel private room. It was super! We had a great time there & enjoyed throughout the night. They have never disappointed us. No doubt this was the 2nd year celebration but it was not my first time at Carousel. I have been there ample times, lunch dinner & also their hi-tea. The staff are very friendly, awesome & very helpful. I have always recommended my friends & relatives to celebrate their special day at Carousel not only bcos of the foods is HALAL & has always been the BEST & FRESH but also of the atmosphere was so marvellous . Up to this day not only friends & relatives I have recommended, the company that I work with had also held company's event at Carousel. Last but not least we have made the right choice choosing Carousel to celebrate this special event bcos we had made the loved ones happy on their Special Day. For those who has never tried, make a reservation now you will never REGRET

It's an awesome birthday celebration that we have didn't expect they will have a special performance thought it's just a surprise cake indeed they made it a memorable experience, if you're celebrating a special day for someone this is the place to try. Thank you! They even sent a personalized picture
5
I have been patronizing Carousel atleast once a year for the past few years. I remember there was a time when they used to have Supper buffet as well.Being a muslim myself, i have made an effort to try out halal buffets in Singapore and i can confidently say that my experience in Carousel is the best. The seafood spread is fresh. And they got a good variety and spread of food. Beautiful ambience and very professional staff.If you find the dinner a lil pricy, check out their high-tea. It is worth it and A Must Go
5
We went to Carousel for Hi Tea to celebrate our boss's birthday. We brought a cake there and they helped us store it in the chiller. All the staff even sang for her with a birthday cupcake and the cake that we brought. The food is good for the price. No complains at all.Can't recommend this place enough :

I wanted to surprise my wife with a Birthday celebration for her at Carousel. I was not disappointed in any way. The food quality was awesome. The variety is very wide, from chinese, Indian, Mediterranean, Seafood, Japanese, etc.... Best of All, It's Halal. They had a small celebration of their staffs singing birthday songs to all who were celebrating their birthday on that day. My wife was surprise to see a staff carrying a small cupcake with a lighted candle to our table and said "Happy Birthday Maam". I was not expecting all this.....One of the staff even come up to us (without asking) and took a picture of us and send it to me immediately by email. Excellent. This made our day, trip, and money all worth while.Excellent job Carousel team. 5 stars to All of you guys

We want an affordable and yet spread to cater for the old folks, children and ourselves so we chose Carousel.Impressed with the hi-tea spread. Sashimi, shell fish, indian, malay, chinese. Desert spread is also plenty. We went on a Tuesday @ SGD39.00++ (10% discount for some credit cards).Was there to celebrate my son's birthday and they offered him a cupcake and Caousel special birthday song. Staff were great and so were the service. Food were topped up almost immediately.Very good experience. Went ahead and book for the next session already
5
Service was number 1! Staff were excellent. Really made the experience special. Lots of food to choose from too. Great seafood =)
4
The staff was very friendly and observant to clear our plates when we were done. Overall quite a lot of variety granted it was high tea.
4
The restaurant serves good range of food variety and service is excellent. They surprised my boy for his birthday with cute decorated cupcake and also staff performed a dance. Definitely will come back again.
5
Was there to celebrate our annual chinese new year dinner for the 3rd year with the same restaurant and also to celebrate our boss's birthday. Staffs are overall friendly and efficent. Food selection was wide and fast replenishment.
5
Staffs were very friendly and helpful. Very professional. Worth the time spent. Well done to all the staffs.
5
I would like to thank all the staff of Carousel, for a wonderful experience for my family & I, on my solemnization day.It was a last minute preparation and Florame Santiago happened to serve me on the phone just a week before our special date, 9 Feb 2014.Even though there was no private rooms available for lunch, she was very dedicated & delivered my special request by accommodating all of us in a corner on a busy Sunday afternoon... On the date of the event, I was greeted by smiling faces upon arrival and was handed a pretty bouquet of roses which was very unexpected. A cute cupcake & 2 loved-messaged chocolates in a box were BONUS!! That really made our day!! The ground staffs were attentive and the food was yummy :-)What's more, we received our "wedding pictures" in an email on the next working day!Kudos to everyone who had made it enjoyable for my family & I - WE WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!Luv, Anne & Boris Foiselle

Made reservations a month beforer the trip. A must do on your trip to SG. We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here and they presented a lovely cake for him. Loved the seafood section and the ice cream section. You can eat your heart out in eating all the hainanese chicken that you want too!!!
3
Wanted to try Carousel as heard of their good food. Went for the hi-tea buffet but was rather disappointed by the lack of variety and the food did not taste as good. The sample hi-tea buffet menu on their website was misleading as a lot of food cannot be found at the buffet itself. Nonetheless, thumbs up for the service as the staff were all very polite and patient
5
First off, Carousel has the BEST bread pudding in the whole of Singapore! Lovely friendly staff, they try their best to make you feel comfortable. When they see us using our hands for some stuff, they immediately gave us those tiny bowls for us to wash hands, without us asking for it! They also have kids cutleries... believe me, SO hard to find a place that provides cutleries for little grownups! Such awesome service! Food wise... everything is great. Carousel is my no.1 choice whenever we go to restaurants or buffets to eat
5
It has been my 3rd year to have CNY dinner with my Customers & family there. We enjoyed the great variety of seafood and others. The ambience is good. The staff are friendly and helpful. They even danced & sang for the Birthday star of the night. Thank you for the great service!!! Keep it up!
4
Wow, the amount of food and variety was outrageous. The taste and quality was amazing. Definitely should go there hungry otherwise it is not worth the price and you will be upset you did not try everything.

Came here twice and both to celebrate birthdays. Indian food was really good! I really love the live pasta section where you can choose any type of pasta and base you want. The Chef will then immediately cook your pasta. First time I came they had Ravioli and it was REALLY GOOD but they didn't had that for my second visit (probably due to change of menu) Their base was still great! Really good recipe for the Vongole! Sushi, cheese, yoghurt, fondue section was good. Fresh oysters shucked infront of you. The cold seafood is quite disappointing, don't get me wrong, the sizes were huge and it had the sweet seafood taste but its texture was tough like it was overboiled or something. This applies for all cold seafood like crayfish, crab, prawn (except for boiled salmon, REALLY MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!) Most of the mousse desserts looked different but tasted similar, like they use the same chocolate mousse. On my first visit, the staff let us pack the birthday cupcake but on my second visit there was no more packaging so we had to finish the cupcake with a really full tummy. Birthday performance was very touching and staff was really great. REALLY LOVE THEIR SERVICE!! Plates cleared like in the blink of an eye and it was sweet of them to leave our fork and spoon on the mat (Most Buffet restaurants will take away your fork and spoon, troubling you to stand up and take again). All in all, will still go here for a birthday
1
Having read the amazing reviews here, my husband and I decided to give this buffet a go and wow, were we disappointed!!! We had a warm welcome, and our waiter was very nice but as we were there for the food, this just wasn't good enough. The seafood section looked good but the prawns, crab and lobster all had an odd texture - either really mushy or quite chewy. I appreciate that these items hadn't come out of the sea that afternoon and had probably been frozen at some stage, but it felt like they had been frozen and thawed and refrozen. The oysters were passable. The Indian section was never replenished the whole time we were there, so some dishes were cold and dry. The cheese was oozing fat and looked totally unappetising, and what was claimed to be Parmesan certainly wasn't. There was laksa, but no noodles to go with it. When I brought this up with the manager, he said it was their style of serving it. No noodles meant the soup was far too strong and salty. Very unpleasant. All in all, I thought this was very disappointing experience. At 62 Singapore dollars a head plus tax it was way overpriced. And I cannot get my head round the glowing reviews. Quantity? Yes. Quality? No. Do yourselves a favour and spend your money elsewhere. I've had far better in a hawker centre. I emailed the hotel about my experience and I'm still waiting for a response. Says it all really.
5
Being to Carousel on numerous occassions prior to this round with hubby. The food never dissapoints- fresh sashimi, prawns and other seafood. I especially love the laksa and popiah. Was really delighted with the newly addes station which allow patrons to cook shabu shabu beef! There are not many Halal certified buffet places in Singapore- definetely a buffet place i will bring my muslim friends. Really value for $. Service was also great. The staff even brought out a bowlof water w lemon slice for me to wash my fingers when they noticed I was peeling prawns. *thumbs up!*
5
When ask to choose a buffet restaurant... Carousel is my 1st choice always... our last dining experience was on 31 Jan for Hi-tea... sort of family gathering for a couple of years and Carousel did not fail us.. As usual great food, great ambience and polite and attentive staff.... We will be back again...
5
Brought my family to Carousel on the second day of CNY for their buffet dinner. Even though it's full house,we were never neglected! Be it collecting of our used plates to just a glass of warm water,we were never spared.. I sincerely appreciate that! I'd say,all the service staffs there were just awesome! Very very attentive and sincere! Be it those in vest or in suit,their service is just remarkable! The place is just very cosy and the aircon is just right! Not too cold.As for the spread,it was magnificent! Just the Sushi n sashimi selection,we were spoilt for choices.. The seafood, especially the oyster,never miss or skip them! The yam paste was so so though but the boh boh itam was marvelous! Non of us dislike it! The cakes,it's really pretty and taste as good! Plus point,not too sweet! Even my mom that cannot take too sweet stuffs,love them! I'd say,everything is just too tempting to be missed! We love the spread so much that we went back 2 days later for my boy's birthday.
5
Decided to celebrate my 28th birthday @ carousel and i was really surprised when the staffs gave me a birthday cupcake and they all sang birthday songs followed by dance steps.. : ) Food was great as there is a lot of variety.Food was all freshly prepared and too many choices for me to choose from..This is the 2nd time i've been there for lunch and high tea and both experience is great..Can't wait to try maybe their dinner..But the best thing abt carousel that makes it stands out even more is the friendly staff..They are always all smile and ready to assist anytime and clearing of the plates are very fast making my dining experience a wonderful one..Recommend all to come and visit Carousel at least once and you will definately want to come again and again..Once is never enough!!Oh ya not forgetting the staff took a picture of me and hubby and even email me on the day itself and they even decorate the picture..Really touch with their gesture..Would definately spend more birthdays and anniversary here as this place is really special..Thumbs UP!!
5
My family and I have been coming to Carousel for their buffet meals since I was just a kid. I've loved every meal with them and have had fond memories of the ambience, service and yummy dishes. I've noticed that they've changed the way they celebrate birthdays at Carousel and this is certainly done in a FANTABULOUS WAY! We celebrated my aunt's birthday last weekend and she was so thrilled by the awesome atmosphere conjured by the staff. Keep it up, I'll definitely return for more memorable celebrations
4
Had a great time last Friday, spending my 40th Birthday with my Family at Carousel. Food was great, Fresh and spoilt for choice. I'm a big eater, even me could not try all the food on serving. I will definitely go again, maybe for the dinner buffet. But i think the strength of Carousel is its staff, they greeted with names , was a special touch. iT felt the staff connected with the customers.Must try for al
5
Today we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Carousel. Food was good.plenty of varieties. Service crews were friendly and professional. the staff even came up to wish us Happy anniversary with special cake on the table. Had photo taken and sent to me via email. Had an enjoyable day at Carousel.keep up Carousel team. we sure have an urge to meet there again for another memorable day dining experience..best place for happy family dining for Singaporeans...... best of luck!!
4
The service and food were both really impressive! The service team was very enthusiastic and the surprise performance by them definitely caught us by surprise. Definitely worth the money. Thank you Carousel!

Celebrated my birthday at Carousel. Food was good. Service crews were friendly and professional. At one occasion, the staff even came up to wish me Happy Birthday. Had a photo taken and sent to me via email. Had an enjoyable day at Carousel.
5
Varied buffet, with many stations. Went for my mother's birthday and they remembered without my reminding them.
4
terrorific value for money, and fantastic staff like Mthi and Shan,,, i will be back. ................................................soon

Had a buffet lunch with my business partners.
The quality of food is just average and service was also just so so.
Overall it is OK for the money we paid.
5
Although I normally do not approve of buffets, I make Carousel an exception. If one has to indulge, once in a while, why not do it well? I have been to many halal buffet places [at least once] but it is Carousel that I always enjoy most and keep coming back to. The variety, the ambience, the service...top notch and sincere. I have never had a negative experience there and it will be my top choice, only choice until something better turns up, to celebrate special occasions. If I may, I wish to take this opportunity to thank those who do their magic in that wonderful kitchen behind Carousel's delicious smorgasbord! Thank you for your hard work and keep up the high standards
5
My 2nd time to Carousel for my hubby's birthday celebration! It was a wonderful n nice surprise performance by the service team! The service staff even spoke to me before hand to ensure we'll be at seats~ Wonderful spread of seafood, desserts, sushi n sashimi! Certainly worth every penny!
4
we reserved for 13 pax after our solemnization. service from the start was v good as they bothered to ask what occasion it was etc and gave us a vip room due to our large number. we were lounging around hotel lobby before the buffet and the staff came to find us to inform us that the room was ready. staff was standing around the entrance to greet us and gave us a bouquet of flowers, cupcake and chocolates. very nice gesture. flowers were very pretty. service was good also. gave one complimentary parking for us, would be good if they could provide complimentary coupons for everybody but this is just a small matter. food wise they had a large variety and interesting food. my family enjoyed the food very much. regretted not having our solemnization at carousel itself
4
The spread of food was good and tasty. The staff provided excellent service. They even brought out mini cupcakes for those who were celebrating their birthdays. However, as it was a Sunday, the place was really crowded and we did not mange to have as much privacy as we would like. Furthermore, there were little toddlers running about and shrieking. Apart from that, we had an enjoyable time and will definitely come back for more
5
I've been to the 'old' Carousel more than 10 years ago, love it then & love it now. Lots of changes made. Service was as excellent as before. My family & I went there to celebrate our youngest brother 19th birthday on 17.01.14.It was a surprise for him as he thought its only our usual dinner gathering. As its a first for my parents & my kids they were surprised to see the wide array of food. From sushi, to cold seafood, to desserts, to local food, plus much more. I was approached by their staff to ensure who is the birthday boy & was told of their surprise birthday song & cupcake. My brother was definitely surprise when the lights dimmed, followed by the birthday song by chefs & staff & cupcakes for those who celebrate their birthday. We got our photo from them in the email too. Do make early reservations as they are fully booked for most weekend & dinner hour. We made ours 1 month in advance. You can do it online at their official webpage. A call/email will follow & a day before our dinner another call by them as final confirmation.LOVE LOVE LOVE the wonderful experience. Definitely worth every penny. From the front desk to the staff to the food not forgetting the kitchen staff too. KUDOS to them
4
Service is excellent. .. staff are quite attentive. We have high tea for celebration.... too bad the spread on Wednesday is not as tempting / sumptuous as on Friday. Has been visiting carousel for the past few months... Still give a thumbs up.
5
Lot of food choices, I like the muesli most and the warm soup noddle, but the que for breakfast was always very long specially on weekend
5
We were there on 10 Jan for hi-tea to celebrate a birthday and were taken aback by a string of surprises. First, all service staff lined up at the entrance to usher each group to their tables and briefly oriented them on the food sections. We were impressed and thought that was it. Half-way through the session, the lights became dimmed (we thought it was faulty) and the birthday song began to play. All service staff and chef surrounded the hall and danced to the music, followed by a parade of service staff holding trays of cupcakes lighted with candles and they served those tables with birthdays. Finally, a service staff went around each birthday table and took a picture with her tablet. Minutes later, we received the framed photo in our email. This is the best customer service we had ever received and the best birthday we had ever celebrated! Amazing!The spread of food is wide and good. Some items are uniquely created. Keep up the good services and food.We will be back
5
The place was first suggested by my wife as we never really tried any good buffet before. I made a reservation and we went there for her birthday celebration for the evening. I knew they have quite a good rating but did not realize reservation was needed for dinner. As expected, the evening was almost a full house. With high expectation, we went in and start trying the food. I must say not many local buffets served lobsters. On top of the lobsters (under cold dish section), they have others like Japanese, Mediterranean, Indian, Local, etc. There have never been a lack of choices. Price may be on the higher end. But with serving of lobster, definitely worth it! Other than us, we saw a least 7-8 birthday celebration there. It was indeed, a great place for birthday celebration. I will recommend anyone who is celebrating birthday to go there. The ambience was really lively with an energetic crew ready to serve. We left the place feeling full and satisfied. I told my wife,"I will be back!
5
Surprise my Boyfriend for our Anniversary Dinner here and he loves it! The service was awesome,They were really fast at clearing our plates,polite and approachable.The food was really really good that we keep getting off our seats to get more.Simply love the ambience and it was really entertaining seeing all the staffs there Happily gathered to sing Birthday song/Dancing.Would like to thank Carousel for making our Anniversary a memorable one & thank you for the complimentary cake! Definitely worth my money & a place to fill up your hungry tummy! willl be coming back again
5
Celebrated Mom's birthday with an excellent lunch buffet here and we enjoyed the experience. A really nice and pleasant environment to dine in. Service was prompt, especially in terms of clearing plates and refilling of water. I loved the Seafood section. Ingredients were fresh and I could not stop going back for more servings. Mom loved the Indian food and the desserts. The Carousel has a reasonable selection of desserts for diners to indulge in from fresh cut fruits and local desserts to western pastries to chocolate fondue, thereâ€™s something for everyone. Memorable experience
5
Big delicious spread and staff were friendly. Great ingredients for an Excellent Quality Product. My family enjoyed the meal we had here. It was my son'd birthday so we invited a few of our relatives. They love the seafood here especially the oysters and lobster. My son is crazy about the japanese sashimi and sushi and I can't remember how many time he want back and fort on this area. My daughter love the desserts and it was presented well and the tastes is just scrumptious so it is hard to say "no" even I was on a watch for my weight. I also love the BYO drink idea/practice on this very restaurant. So bring your favorite wine or bubbly and you do not have to worry about having to pay any corkage fee that other restaurants incur on your bill after meal ... that usually sucks!
4
Went for high tea at carousel to celebrate my birthday. The service was excellent as the servers/waitress make sure that our empty plates are cleared so that we can go on to getting more food:)I'm not a big eater so the food variety is definitely more than enough for me. A rough gauge of food choices is available in their website menu. The food served is not bad I would say, especially for the cold dishes as they are very fresh. The price for one is $38++. However there is a credit card promotion for 10% off the bill, so I do advise the use of credit cards to pay the bill to save some money
5
There are not many halal buffets in Singapore and this one really makes up for it.I have tried the tea time, lunch and dinner. I must say I love the dinner BEST as there are so many choices.Food are served fresh and the variety i simply love. The dessert station has many different kinds of delectable decadent yummies!!If u love sashimis, dont wait
5
Actually i went there for buffet 2 years ago for company dinner. It can said this is one of the best buffet in Singapore.Although the price was a bit expensive but it is worth. I love their cold dishes very much. The lobster, oysters are fantastic! This is the best cold dishes in Singapore.This restaurant is one of the top 3 ( the best international buffet in Singapore) among all 5 stars hotels i tried for the past few years
5
the ambiance was good and staff service was beyond our expectation. buffet was really nice. keep it up!
4
Sumptuous Food, Great Atmosphere, Attentive Staff and Fantastic Service.
I am taking this liberty to speak on behalf of all of us:
Our Parents/Our Grand-Parents/Our Great Grand-Parents...
...had a wonderful time at the Carousel!
Thank you.
James

Good food, but often long waits for breakfast, and food not replenished. So get in early if you want to try the dishes or be disappointed.
5
To me, e food was nice n theres lots of varieties. As for e service, its excellent! Tq for the gd experience.
5
I only have positive comments on Carousel. Value for money and it's about the only Halal hotel restaurant in Singapore
4
Carousel provides one of the best variety on food selection for buffet in town. The seafood and desserts sections are the ones not to be missed.The staffs are very friendly and their service are top-notch. I'll definitely come back again.Except that we were placed by the far side of the restaurant, which was quite warm and we were perspiring during our meal
5
This was not the first time I had celebration here, we had our wedding anniversary and my birthday celebration here too. Of course we are back due to the awesome food and the warmth welcome by the friendly staff. And with the extra effort made by the staff to actually dance to the birthday song was really excellent...that was something new. Keep it up guys!!! Sure we will be back for more
5
I was pleased to be given a private cosy corner to celebrate my birthday with my family. We chose Caurosel was because of the wide international spread particularly the sashimi and fresh seafood particularly the fresh oysters as well as the lobsters. We enjoyed the meal with such a nice environment, pleasant and smiling service staffs
5
Seeing all e party hats on every table today since its New Year's Day makes me so excited,as it was my bday as well.u guys made my day w e cupcake, the dance & bday song,e photo taking done by ur service staff n (send promptly thro email!) and of coz e wonderful service!!never been happier!looking forward to spending more bdays w u guys
5
My family keep on coming back to this place because of the food. And since we love the food, i decided to do my rom ceremony here. My decision was very perfect. Staff made the arrangements for the ceremony. Special thanks to Karlson who made everything possible. Staff are very very nice. I soooo love this restaurant!!
4
Good place to be at, especially when you really want to tuck into some delicious food. Service is not too bad.
4
Went there for a birthday celebration. The service was very good and we enjoyed the wide variety of food. Will definitely return.
5
Fantastic food spread, heavenly desserts, warm cosy ambience, friendly crew, complimentary birthday cupcake. What more can you ask for. Totally loved the idea of all the staff singing and dancing the birthday song. Looking forward to come back again.
5
My family was there on 25/12/13 to celebrate my husband's birthday. Not only we were delighted with the pleasant environment and great variety of tasty food, the staff put up a entertaining dance before presenting a birthday cupcake to my husband.It makes the celebration all the more wonderful
5
Sometimes i forgot to buy groceries so in the morning i wake up and have nothing to eat. Since my place is closed to Scotts and Orchard, I have my morning walk to RP Hotel and have breakfast at Carrousel. So many selections to chose from. You will definitely have an over fulfilling breakfast if you don't chose wisely. The noodle station is good. Local section is my preference.
5
I selected the restaurant for my company's year end cum X'mas event. Although it was an high tea event, the food selection (turns out to be international buffet) is way above my expectation. The place was packed probably due to the festive season but the service quality was not compromised. Empty plates were collected rapidly and food were replenished at regular quick intervals. Staff is very friendly and helpful and celebrated birthday for 2 of my staff; each had a lovely cupcake to bring home. Overall it was a very wonderful experience and I am glad to have chosen this venue and would recommend to others. The only improvement I could think of is to maybe add a few festive food items to the already extensive menu. Good Job
4
While staying at the Royal Plaza on Scotts, we had the chance to have breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. It's in buffet, and it's one of the most diverse one I ever had: asian, indian, tepaniaki, all kind of eggs, soups, pastries, you name it, they had it. The prize, 28 Sg $, is high, but certenly worth it
5
Easily one of the best buffet in Singapore with the wide array of food available, with the freshest seafood and sashimi available. Dessert bar was pretty awesome too, and the birthday surprise from the staff was really sweet and cute. all in all, a wonderful experience
5
My 7th time here and glad to know the food, ambience and services are still one of the best every time. Foods and dessert are always fresh and replenished well. Servers are always around and attentive whenever we need them. One suggestion though, it was a surprise birthday celebration for a friend and we were given table 17, just by the entrance so we could not see the birthday song performance clearly (blocked by a wall). It be great if you could put the groups having birthday celebration at the main section so we can enjoy it too! Well if that's possible if not it's not really a huge problem. :) Apart from that, will still keep coming for the great time
5
It was yet another eventful dinner at Carousel. its the number one choice for our family events and occasions. GREAT SPREAD be it breakfast, lunch, hi-tea and dinner... Excellent service rendered at every occasion we were there. Good job Carousel! Warm and caring service by the crew!
5
Best value in town. We love the variety of food on offer and its freshness and the attentive service we always receive at Carousel. Even though the restaurant is full, you never have to stand in line as the food stations are well spread out.
5
Strongly recommend Carousel for gatherings or private function.I had booked the botht he private function rooms for my grassroot event yesterday and the experience turned out to be fabulous, fantastic and finally WOW!!!!The waiters, waitresses, restaurant managers and event the billing staff were all having great smiles on their faces to receive us as well as helping us in all aspects.Definitely will go back for more!Mr Te
5
The food spread is fantastic but the dinner menu is more than the lunch menu. However, ambience and lighting is great. Kids loved the singing and dancing crew performance for birthdays. That is a distinctive "feature" of Carousel. Keep it up. I thought it was like a Flash Mob :) two thumbs up to the team!
4
This is one of the Singaporean restaurant my kids would love to go especially for their seafood selection. We are all crabs lovers, so this is easily accepted. Food drinks was fabulous, enjoying every moment of it!The sashimi was not bad and the desserts were plentiful with cakes and fruits.he staff's service is excellent, you can see that they are all very busy but they never fail to give you a smile wherever your eyes met theirs.Will come again for events in future. Thank you very much

Today we our company having a team building lunch. We love the seafood- cray fish, crabs and prawns as I always found them to be very fresh and original. Not to mention the yogurt.. extremely nice and smooth. Yummy Yummy. :) The environment is nice and food always replenished on time. Thanks Carouself for the fresh seafood... this month is my colleague birthday and she is very surprised to receive a complimentary birthday cupcake and a warm birthday special song from Carousel. Thank you fot the work done by Carousel
5
Apart from the good food, i LOVE the service provided by the staff! They were warm and welcoming from the start to the end. My husband and i were celebrating our anniversary and we brought our 2 month old with us, they were thoughtful by giving us plenty of space so that we can place our stroller by our side. The staff helped me carried my food back to our table when they saw me carrying my daughter. To top it off, they surprised us with an anniversary cupcake :) Their excellent service made the evening even better, one of the best service we've experienced :
1
Sorry, but this was a bust for me. I ate here 4 times. Really nothing special. Over priced and mediocre service. Really, really wanted to love it here but didn't. Like the Hotel, very pretty to look at but that's it. Front staff was borderline rude to me and others while waiting. It's obviously a machine that runs and runs, so anything that may disrupt that machine (oh, like the woman in front of me who had a question about her bill) cannot be tolerated. Ugh. Go across the street and spend this kind of money at the Hyatt--much better
5
Staff was polite. Especially Maureen,Lin,Mega,CK..even though hotel is undergoing renovations,it's still a pleasure to dine here.the food was something I looked forward to.food was constantly topped up,no platter was left empty.have been celebrating most birthdays here. Been for dinner and high tea.next will be having lunch here

6 years ago, I brought my girlfriend here on our first date. That day was a significant one and Carousel really made it memorable with great ambience and variety of food. 6 years on and we are now husband and wife, and we keep coming back to Carousel to reminisce on fond memories and enjoy great food. Lastly, thank you for the wonderful surprise you gave my wife on our anniversary! It has been a great experince for us! :

Went there to celebrate a bdae.. was thankful they could offer us a table despite not having made a reservation.. we were spoilt for choices with the wide array of delicacies. Love the dessert corner! Friendly, polite and efficient staff who were always ever ready! Even more glad to have received a pic of us personally sent to our email at the end of the day! Very happy to have dined there.

Celebrating our 17th anniversary and was surprised with a complimentary cupcake which had made our dinner even more special. Awesome food and spoilt for choices as well excellent service by the staffs. Will definitely come back again. However need to make reservation way in advance.

Went for lunch with colleague.
The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.
Though it is a bit pricey but good food and great service!
Overall, an excellent experience, I would definitely return.

Had my Wedding Anniversary celebration here, for the Second year running. Nice ambience and of course good food. The service staffs are always on the ball to serve my needs and really made my day special. Looking forward to comeback again. Thanks Carousel.

Had birthday celebration dinner at carousel, variety food with great taste, the staff Mega is very nice, she is serving us with smile throughout dinner and very helpful at all time.

A great buffet for dinner. Carousel serves a huge variety of cuisines, featuring a variety of sweet treats . Special mention must be made of its bread & butter pudding and Asian selections. Service was also prompt, especially in terms of clearing plates and refilling of water. Overall, the food was excellent. Efficient staff who can do many tasks from giving info. cleaning up to bartender.Pricey but worth

I visited Carousel for my 14th wedding anniversary. Service was prompt including the ease of online booking. Price was reasonable and duration for the high-tea was sufficient. Good spread of cold dish and other type of food. Will visit there again for special occasion. Do try it
4
The buffet dinner and the ambience was nice. Staff were efficient in clearing up our plates and Ms Yap Peng was kind enough to brief us on the varities and locations of the buffet display. Wish that theres more varieties for the amt paid esp when buffet drinks only serves tea and coffee. A male staff was kind enough to approach me telling that theres a hook under the table to hang my handbag for my own seating comfort. Staffs gather for a short sing a long birthday song for birthday babies with complimentary cupcake given. Was a bit disappointed as they overlook our table as it was our wedding anniversary and had received an email beforehd stating a comp cupcake will be given after indicating it on ur reservation. However overall was a pleasant dining experience
5
Superb selection of food, friendly and attentive staff, great ambience! Planned a surprise birthday dinner for my 16-year old daughter on Nov 25th (ensure you make reservation in advance as the restaurant is almost always full). Service is awesome and my daughter had a fantastic night with her friends! This is not the first time I celebrated a special occasion at Carousel - been here for my son's 18th birthday and countless other catch-up sessions with friends
5
I totally love their services!! Really! This is what makes us remember about them! Every staffs wears a smile, friendly and polite. Dirty empty plates are always cleared without having to call for them.. Water is always refilled. If this is your first visit, there will be staff explaining to you about the overalls, making you feel so welcome!Of course the food quality is awesome too! Unlimited lobsters people! Food selections are wide as well. I think the Chinese and Japanese food have rooms for improvements though. Desserts are delicious! Too bad the frozen yogurt was out of service today. Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday as well. Surprise singing and little performance from all the crews! Little muffin birthday cake was served with a candle too. They took pictures for us using their iPad and send to our email. An additional service offered by them. Price wise, I would say its worth it. I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to have buffet and/or place to celebrate birthday!

I have been here since they were known as Venice café and since then they have never disappoint me. Except that if you are with a group of 3 or more you’ll need to make reservations. Had my birthday dinner with family and everyone enjoyed. Performance was good! Pricey but worth! Excellent food, excellent service and excellent staff
5
This is no doubt the best halal buffet restaurant u will ever find in this world. The service, staff, food, ambience, price are superb. It's an experience that u would want again again.
5
Best Halal buffet with a huge spread & good service. It's a little pricey but worth it. It's advisable to reserve in advance cause it's always full.

Simply the Best Buffet Restaurant in Singapore!
Though it is a bit pricey but good food and great service!

I was pretty surprised that when booking online, the system showed that the next available date was about 1week+ away. Popular place...
Good spread of food. The dessert spread was impressive. Satisfied with the Japanese/sashimi section.
Overall above average.
4
Very accommodative. Gd food.worth spending quality time with family n kids..we had a birthday song frm the working crew and a very nice cup cake for the birthday guest. Its a definite value for money...
5
My all-time favourite place to have buffet with family & friends. ;)
Loved the food & place.. All the staff are very friendly.
4
Had a splendid good time there. A great place for celebration and gathering. Wide variety of choices for food. From east to west.
4
liked --chefs helped plan menu for children with allergies well :)
loved the asian section of the buffet with fresh noodles and steaming hot broth.
disliked--when you wake up late, it takes some time to be seated because there is a long line
5
My fiancÃ© took me here for my bday dinner, in Nov 22nd, luckily we got a table (always book ahead to go here). Superb food, endless selection, even desserts are really good. Great service, u will never see dirty empty plates in your table. I even got a surprise bday cake and bday wish from the crew (me and several people there who are also having a bday dinner), very thoughtful of them. Overall, its recommended place if you really like to eat hehehhe. Crowded but good food indee
5
Me and my wife celebrated our anniversary in Carousel. The variety of seafood was good here and Japanese section was good also. There was a local section of Chicken/Duck rice. Also international selections of Chinese, Western & Indian food.The colourful section of the desserts was the best. Many choices to chose from. . Before we ended our dinner, we were presented with a cupcake top up with a ''Happy Anniversary'' and crew took a photo of us and email us the photo.This was a wonderful experience and I will visit here agai
5
Celebrated my daughter's birthday here through my son's recommendation. Loved the variety of food and once they knew it was my daughter's birthday, they presented her with a cupcake and a special Carousel birthday song. Truly a wonderful experience. Will visit here again.
5
I' ve been to Carousel a couple of times and I really enjoy myself every single time I went there. A good place for celebrations or gatherings. Thank you Carousel for serving us splendid food. Will be looking forward to go there again.
5
It was amazing! This is not my first time.. I went here many times.. Cos the food are always superb.. Staff are very friendly.. They even give extra service like took a picture of us and email a copy.. Thumbs up, carousel!
5
The best place place for delightful halal high tea. Foods selections were delicious with vatieties from western to all ethnics local delicacies. The desserts selections were colorful with varieties. The restaurant ambience is cosy and relax. The services was good from the staff. Best high tea in town! Keep up the good & stay to be best
5
Gathering with few fellow friends few day ago for buffet lunch at carousel booked by friends. first dining experience here and it was excellent, just like what been told by my friends. Their service was lighting speed, tip top and scrumptious buffet spread. Staffs and chefs very friendly, if memories serve me right, pasta chef Alex was so charm & friendly. I learn to cook pasta right from him and he also told me to try out the signature dish of this restaurant. I think pasta should be part of their highlight too.They even held birthday celebration, this place really high traffic flow all the time i think. No wonder my friends was keep hard selling to me! well done everyone, Bravo!
5
This is one restaurant my kids would love to go especially for their seafood selection. We are crabs lover, and they have an excellent spread. The yogurt is yummy. The staff is attentive. Holding a birthday celebration is a joyous affair where all the staffCelebrated with you. Thank you carousel for making such a joyous day for my family.
5
I wanted to reserve two pax for the international buffet at Carousel but the online reservation was already full, so i emailed them and told them i would really like to go with my partner to celebrate his birthday and they replied very promptly and accepted my reservations along with a complimentary cupcake and birthday singing on the day itself . There was warm welcome but the receptionists and the spread was really sumptuous. we really enjoyed the fresh spread of seafood and sashimi, and the servers were very prompt in clearing our empty plates and refilling our water. a bowl of lemon water was also provided for us to clean our hands after eating the seafood. the staff enthusiastically danced while singing the birthday song and offered to take a picture for us and emailed the picture to me. we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at carousel; be it the quality of food or service there. Carousel has been voted the best buffet for seafood and international cuisine and it really lives up to its reputation; the price is also very reasonable, compared to other international buffet where the price is much higher. Strongly recommend Carousel for people looking for a good dinner or celebration. Do remember to reserve early 
5
Our first time dining experience was excellent. Warm & friendly staffs greeted us with personal usher to our dining table. Service was very good. Scrumptious buffet spread. Husband love the cupcake & the birthday performance by the staffs. Overall, satisfying & excellent service. Will definitely recommend this place to family & friends. THUMBS UP CAROUSEL !!!! :
4
One of the best buffet I tried in Singapore. From appetizer to dessert all satisfy... I luv their home made of berry n walnuts cheese it's wonderful. N the Canadian oyster, lobster, teppanyaki garlic prawn n French dessert corner... I will go again with friends ...
5
I am very much satisfied with my first ever dining experience in Carousel. The food was awesome. It has the variety of seafood, international and asian cuisine, and great desserts. The service of the whole team was really something to be proud of. From the call they made to remind of your reservations, the warm welcome when we arrived, the surprise birthday performance they had for the birthday celebrants with matching cake was a very awesome idea. I will definitely return and much more, recommend the place to family and friends.
5
Carousel lived up to its expectations of being one of the best buffet restaurant in Singapore and wonderful variety of food selections!
4
Was there for birthday celebration. A complimentary cupcake was given by hotel.
Personally like their desserts (chocolate fondue, chocolate cakes and ice cream). The seafoods are very fresh and delicious. Delectable halal food buffet with great hotel staff service.
5
Everything was great. I'm from Japan so my sushi expectation is high. The dessert selection is the devil's work, but in a good way!
4
Hearing so much good reviews for this place,so me and my hubby decided to have our wedding anniversary lunch there.Making reservation online was a breeze and they send you email confirmation plus phone call.Good service indeed. I was given a free cupcake to celebrate our anniversary which I feel they are thoughtful. I just feel that for the price like this for lunch,they should consider having fresh oysters at the seafood bar.Wide choices of food and desserts. Those who haven't go there,do give it a try

I would be writing this review as a whole. Firstly, booking wise was rather simple and service was good i must say. confirmation was a breeze, although it did take some time just to photocopy the confirmation slip. I booked a private room for a company event by the way.Food wise, not impressive at all. it was a lunch celebration during the Deepavali holiday in 2013. by 1.35pm, the nasi briyani ran out, and there was no refill. I mean, come on, this is a buffet, at least have a refill standby!pasta was even more disappointing. there was a guy in front of me who ordered basil pasta (looked kinda creamy). after cooking his pasta, the cook didn't even bother to rinse his pan, using the previous guy's sauce and cooking my aglio olio and it tasted nothing like aglio olio.the salmon sashimi was fresh, although there were very little left. at this point, i didn't bother eating anymore as it was not impressive at all.another gripe i had was that i booked a private room for 12 pax. usually, with such number, you could at least get 3-4 parking coupons (a wedding dinner would give at least 30% too). when i called to ask, the service personnel couldn't even be bothered to try asking the manager, and just turned me down saying that parking is outsourced to DFS, bla bla bla and nothing could be given. upon pushing her, she finally relented and checked with the manager. the call back was even more stunning, she told me she could only provide me 1 parking coupon. 1 MISERABLE parking coupon. come on, i have had this company event in carousel 2 year's in a row, and this is what i get for customer loyalty. thanks carousel, this is the last time we would be patronizing you
5
My birthday was superb! Hubby surprised me having lunch at Carousel. Food drinks was fabulous, enjoying every moment of it! Another big surprise came when the lights start to dim. Out of sudden there was a birthday song, the staffs started to sing and cheer! I tried to control my tears, but I couldn't.. :') 
5
I will like to thanks to Corousel Restaurant for make it happen for us to celebrate my wife birthday. I was awsome and very nice arrangement. The staff are very friendly. Thanks to a staff name Mega that took our photo and email to me immeadiately. I strongly recommend to all to dine in this restaurant. Thank you again May God Bless all the team

Went on a Thursday night and place was full. There is a sushi/sashimi station, teppanyaki, fresh seafood, cooked dishes, Indian food. At the western section there was a roast, a huge fish and a pasta station. The best was the northern Indian section. The seafood looked great (lobster, oysters, prawns etc) but was not terribly fresh. The sashimi was not bad. The desserts were plentiful but in the end the best items were the vanilla ice-cream (fresh and had some nuts in it) and one of the cheeses which unfortunately ran out fast. I would recommend that you head across the road to Mezza-9 for a superior buffet
5
This is our third stay at the Royal Plaza and the main reason we keep coming back is the fabulous Carousel! If you cannot have a fantastic meal with so much beautifully fresh seafood and other choices then you must eat to live and not live to eat! We celebrated my son's birthday there this time and just loved the special cup cake and 'cabaret'! The staff are always so friendly and helpful and help make dinner (or breakfast!) a special event. We will always go back when in Singapore and can't wait to see the new renovations completed (loved the new marble entrance floor)
5
Totally aweome experience at Carousel with a fantastic spread of buffet -seafood that are really fresh and cooked food that is totally yummy.The desserts spread was so tempting that you cannot resist but will want to try ALL.Celebrated our birthdays there and it was a memorable experience.Service was excellent, too.Keep it up and will certainly highly recommend to friends S Lin

The doorman was very rude and loud. It gave me a very bad impression of the hotel. The floor in the cafe was very oily ans slippery.
4
The woman who loves to make your noodle soup from scratch - she is great and so is her signature dish!
5
what can i say about Carousel, award winning buffet line, wonderful scrumptious spread of food. There is definitely something for everyone and love the fresh seafood and dessert line.
4
The buffet is always rich with a lot of choices , the staff are always attentive to serve you with a smile . We hope to see some new dishes next time .
5
Carousel is one grate if you are looking for value for what you spend. I had not seen a wide spread of food from Western to Asian. It is to rave about and the tastes is five star. The seafood (I love the oysters.. so yummy!)- it is fresh and the prawns were so crunchy. The sushi selection is to die for and the ambiance was complimented by it's wonderful staff who were all very attentive to your needs and always serving with a friendly smile. Comes 8:30pm, all the staff would gather around and the a birthday music ring the entire place to greet all the birthday celebrants. They gets you the most merry celebrating mood with their dancing and singing. I thought it was the greatest idea especially if you are the shy type as it doesn't make you feel you are the center of attention. The chef is pro-actively doing his round to check every section making sure that things are in place and he is very approachable. He can recommend you the best dish of the night and you could not be more than please. I brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate a special occasion and I was informed that it is corkage free even on a regular day. What a lovely experience indeed. I will recommend to anyone who love food and looking for best service in town
5
I went to this restaurant on my sonâ€™s 5th birthday. The staff service was extremely wonderful. They made us really happy and surprise with a special night - The staff was singing and dancing when we had our dinner with the fresh seafood. This restaurant was really good, the seafood was extremely fresh and delicious. I love this restaurant
5
The last time i've been to Carousel was a few years back. Then and now, they are known for delivering the best quality and variety of food. We went for dinner as a couple on Saturday.The seafood was extremely fresh. Loved the Oysters, Snow Crabs, Lobsters, Salmon and various clams. Most guests, including myself, went for 2nd or 3rd rounds. The Sushi section was also very fresh, thou i would have liked even more selection. The hot food sections were great with a lot of variety and interesting mix of flavours (Western, Eastern & Mediterranean). Not forgetting the Dessert sections, which served the best bread & butter pudding i've ever tasted. It had a variety of cakes, fruits and also the new yogurt station. The yogurt station had 3 flavours and it was a great finishing touch for me.Service was good and friendly, I like the fact that they were fast at clearing unused plates on our table and also food was replenished quickly. The atmosphere was relaxed, thou i hope they can choose better background music to further improve the mood. Suggestion: slow classical music/piano.It was also a good surprise, when staffs started singing Happy Birthday and danced a little number for guests who were celebrating their Birthday, that day. I received a beautiful and delicious Birthday Cupcake and they also took our picture and emailed to us the next day. We had a great time and will be coming back again this November for another Birthday celebration
4
It was after about 10 years since my hubby and I had a meal in this restaurant. We can still remember vaguely the old layout of this place then. To our astonishment, this place has not just changed (layout are more modern now), their food variety, staff service have also gave us a totally different feeling. I didnt regret suggesting this place for my hubby's birthday, we tried their lunch on a Saturday. The staff's service is excellent, you can see that they are all very busy but they never fail to give you a smile wherever your eyes met theirs -- each single one. Their food quality and variety are fresh and delightful, making you feel especially spoiled with choices. I can only pick on the part that they are missing oysters in their list of items, which I was quite surprised. Overall, I will recommend this place for their service and quality of food
5
I would like to express my thanks especially to the staff by the name of Mary.Ms Mary had been attentive to our needs, especially when we informed her that we werefirst timers to dine at the restaurant.Without us telling she had never once failed to top up our drinks and clear our plates, and she even explained to me when the cake will arrived when i informed her that its my fiance's bday.I am very satiesfied with the service rendered my Mary. Thank you very much I will definitely come again. I love all the food especially the risotto and the cheese platter ..i was too full to enjoy the desserts though. Will come again for events in future. THank you very much! ;
5
On 19/10/2013 me and family patronised at Carousel for Hi-Tea. It was my son Birthday, the staffs even present Birthday cupcakes and sang Birthday song. Its surprised us!! And its one of the best moment for us....The foods too are soo good and superb. We'll definitely come back...:)Thanks to Carousel staffs and management for the memorable family photo that was taken on that day as complmentary...We love it so much!!!Best RegardsSiti Zain

It was my second time visiting carousel and the food selection has always astounded me. There is a teppanyaki section, japanese section, seafood, salads, soups, asian, indian, western, hot food, and best of all, an extensive dessert section!The teppanyaki was good, and the range of seafood was excellent. What impressed me was the western section which had a huge array of sauces. The pasta was really good too! It was one of the live stations that they had. Overall, the food quality did not disappoint and we were constantly spoilt for choice. Food was replenished quickly. The desserts had 4 stations, ranging from yoghurt to cakes. I enjoyed the bread and butter pudding as well as the rich chocolate pudding best of all, and could not stop myself from taking serving after serving! We also celebrated a family member's birthday, and the staff came out and sang and danced a happy birthday song for all patrons who were celebrating birthdays! They came out with a special huge birthday muffin which was really nice. One staff member even came to take a photo and sent it to us! Overall, I would not hesitate to say that this place did not disappoint at all and I would definitely come back again! The atmosphere, friends, food and the service was really good
5
Excellent food 9/10 (Indian food section and raw seafood are really good)Excellent Staff service 10/10, good service and friendlyWe were very surprise by their birthday celebration, the staff was singing and dancing and a complimentary birthday.pay about $50 ++ per head but it worth the money
4
It was my first visit to Carousel and I had a great experience celebrating my boyfriend's 28th birthday. We were running a bit from the booking time and yet they were very kind to show us our seat with a smile on their face. On top of that it was the eve of a public holiday, therefore they have a bit of a crowd. As mentioned on their website, they really have all the items on their buffet spread. However, if you are a MAJOR seafood lover like my boyfriend, this is the place for you. The choice of cold seafood spread is amazing. The food is fresh and the way they prepare it, it's rather easy to eat. The cook food section was pretty interesting though I did not managed to try all the item. Their dessert was really good and their chocolate desserts are particularly rich. If you are a dessert fan, their dessert is worth it. It's not too sweet and yet rich. While I do admit it's a little bit pricey, you do not get pushy diners. Everyone was prim and proper and very courteous. No one was rushing for any of the food. Staff were very attentive, you will be able to find them around if you need help. They are constantly around to help you clear your plates and yet they do not make you feel that they are invading into your privacy. The birthday celebration was great. They had a performance for the birthday diners however I requested for a quiet corner, therefore we didn't really get to watch it. It was very special and they ensure that the birthday person was on their table before bringing the cake. This was how attentive their staff is. I will definitely visit again
5
It was a memorable birthday celebration for my fiancé. I was impressed with the service and the staff's attentiveness. Service was excellent and I couldn't expect more. I'm glad we chose to dine in here and thank you for the great and warm hospitality. :D p.s. To the staff who did the special birthday dance, you guys were daebak (wonderful). A gazillion thanks to all of you.
5
Dear to all Carousell team,Thank you so much for all the services! It was fantastic! Thanks for the pictures too, it was such a different experience for me and my partner. Im glad ive choose Carousel as part of my plan for my partners birthday dinner celebration! The dance, the friendly staffs, the complimantary cake and all! Thank you once again! Regards,Sheil
5
It was my second time visiting carousel and the food there Is fantastic. First time round I was not the organizer so I can't feel how great was their service. I only know that all their staff were attentive and the spread is good.On my second visit, which I'm organizing for my fiancé birthday, the experience was great. We went on a week end hence we got a chance to eat Alaska crab. The seafood is really fresh. Carousel replied to my email very quickly to confirm my reservation and also some of my quries. What I love the most is the dance that lead by the staff. The staff actually dance in the middle of everyone while we are having our dinner. Cup cake was serve as a birthday cake which is really very sweet of them to do so. Last but not least they came to our table took a picture for us and emailed to me, which the picture is nicely done up.All in all this is literally a "dining experience". I will highly recommend to everyone who loves seafood to go
4
For travellers on a budget, think twice before going here. It is quite expensive mid to fine dining buffets are priced here in singapore. But to those who can shell out around 70 to 100 sgd for a buffet dinner, I think it is reasonably ok for those who can feast on sea foods and have a huge appetite for all the other tasty menu they have. Just a few rounds on the Oyster, Lobsters, spanner crabs and I would say I am ok. Always take time to taste each and every dish on the spread as all are tastefully good. Creme Brulee looks simple but they are heavenly... :)Thumbs up for this
5
Nice restaurant, there was plenty of food (all looked yummy). I tried so hard not to eat too much sea crab, and so I could enjoy the sweet and delicious deserts. The price is quite expensive, but since it’s fresh sea food, it is what it takes
5
Went there for dinner on 07 Oct and hi-tea on 08 Oct to celebrate my fiancé bday. There are many and various kind of food from main course to dessert...So happy and the food is match from criteria of taste. The waiter and waitress are very sporting and on time..They'll sing and serve.The service very good and excellent.Good job and well done to Ms.Sherelin Kaur.Good job and Keep It UP!
4
There is a huge selection of food that ranges from Japanese to Indian cuisine. Centrally located at Royal Plaza on Scotts Road, it is popular among locals and tourists alike. It is the only buffet place that is halal certified so it is the ideal place for a gathering with your Muslim friends!The price that you pay for this huge selection is considered reasonable. They accept major credit cards.
5
Excellent 5 star service from the staff. Attentive & proactive. Online Booking is extremely easy. Food abit too salty. Wonderful birthday flash mob which gave my mum & hubby a great surprise.
5
We visited yesterday with family. It was a pleasant surprise for the Birthday song done by all the staff at the restaurant. Most memorable evening we had. Courteous service and excellent ambience. Food variety is perfect.
5
Delivery of the birthday cake was different from the last one Carousel did for my girl. It was a pleasant surprise for both me and my hubby!
As usual Carousel never fail to deliver. Excellent job by the staff on shift. Keep it up!
5
What a magnificent spread of food encompassing many different cuisines. This is the best buffet meal we have ever had. The occasion was our oldest son's 16th Birthday. He enjoyed the singing of the birthday song and dannce by the staff. Wonderful service and food, the perfect mix for an excellent meal! Will definately have the buffet dinner again
4
Went there for hi-tea on 4 Oct to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Although the food was good, like some of the reviewers, I too felt that for $43++ we could have more of sushi and sashimi and cakes too. The fact that sushi and sashimi were 'hidden' in a corner, far away from the main spread left me asking why was it so. I missed it in my first round of inspection of the hi-tea spread. I only saw it when I went a second round. All in all, I was happy with the service because staff members were alert and attentive, though I must say I was a bit dissappointed they missed our table when they were giving out the birthday cupcakes to others who were also celebrating their special day. They gave my hubby his little birthday cupcake only after I alerted a staff member :(.Good service but as they say, "there's always room for improvement"!Oh...thank you for the photo. I love it! :
4
Had high tea at Carousel on a rather busy Friday. Paid 43 dollars for it. The service was impeccable, refilling of water was frequent and plates were cleared rather quickly, and it was really nice of Carousel to offer a cupcake cake for people celebrating their birthdays there, birthday songs were sung once every 15 minutes or so. However I wasn't left particularly impressed by the range of food, or probably it always has been the case for high tea and most likely not the case for lunch and dinner. Was surprised at how much better the prawns tasted than the crab, sashimi was good and replenished on time, sandwiches and salads were plentiful. Local fare were limited in variety, not much going on as it consisted of food that I could have gotten at other buffet restaurants. Their ice kacang was great though, totally loved it but I wish there were more cakes and ice-cream flavours to choose from.Overall I wouldn't say it's REALLY worth the price as there're other buffets around that are more worth their prices, but the service is great and certain foods are great. Lunch or dinner would probs be more worth it
5
Celebrated my sister's birthday and it was truly a wonderful experience. From door to bill, it is the experience that makes me return time and again. Besides the food - well as a restr in a 5 star outfit, we would expect the food to be of a certain standard. And off course the food is GOOD ! But ultimately the service, personalised and attention to details by the staff that makes a difference. Royal Plaza can be proud to have such dedicated and committed staff - Carousel is it ! Cheers
5
Went for high tea and as expected they offered great varieties of foods from cold dishes such as crab claws to mussels, main dishes to really nice desserts. All i can say is they are all very nice even after all these years they still maintain their high standard in both foods and customer service. Also as it was our birthday (yes ours lol) all the staffs gathered at the centre to sing for us. What a nice gestures!! Love it! And Thanks for the nice birthday cup cakes
5
The experience that we had last night was superb! Carousel is a nice place to have celebrations. Especially for birthdays when the entire staff sings out and dances on birthday songs. Thank you so much for making my Hubby's Birthday so special. We will visit them again for sure:
5
My team and I have been to many restaurants for our monthly team building and the experience that we had last night was superb! aside from good food, nice ambiance, the asset of this resto are the staff! Super friendly and accomodating. I will visit them again for sure
4
Staffs are smiley and greets all the time. Food spread was just nice. Birthday song aired and sang by the staffs were surprising.
5
it was really good and splendid to have such good people. Especially for birthdays when the whole entire staff sings out the birthday song. Thanks for everything.
5
Not the 1st time here... Been here so many times and everything seems to be consistent. Love the ambience, food always tasty, very good customer service. Always enjoy the experience there. Keep it up!
4
Excellent selection of food suitable all dietary preference. Fresh sashimi and seafood. Tasty and savoury dishes. Great ambience and fantastic wonderful service.
3
The restaurant served tasty halal food and huge spread of food selection. Atmosphere is ok, but seatings were a bit too cramp. Probably it was a peak period.
5
Carousel is a nice place to have celebrations with both family and friends. I have brought my family and friends there for our celebrations a few times before and we do have a nice time there. Firstly, the atmosphere is very nice. From the moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted with a nice lobby where you can take pictures before or after eating there. You can also take pictures in Carousel itself and be able to capture the moments spent there. Secondly, I like the wide selections of food, in particular, the deserts. What I like the most would be the chocolate fondue fountain, fruits, ice-cream and cakes. Another nice thing is that you can also order what you want to eat such as 'laksa'. I like the coffee machine too where can get mocha and cappuccino.For the service, if you do need any, you can always ask them and they will able to help you such as helping you to celebrate a family or friend's birthday by singing them a song and giving them a nice cupcake. Hence, if I have any celebration to celebrate be it for my family or friends, Carousel will be the place I will think of to have my celebration in. Just remember to book it earlier. :

I used to organize events for my department. As my dept consists of Halal and vegetarian colleagues, I will usually choose this restaurant as they have wide selection of food, Japanese, Indian, Western, Italian, fresh seafood, local food etc..Dessert selection was equally good. Would strongly recommend for lunch and dinner buffet, but you need to make reservation at least one week before
5
We first got to know about carousel many years ago and had returned to Carousel in recent months. We liked the food selection where it has equal appeal to my meat lover daughter, vege, fruit and dairy lover son and fish lover husband :) The food quality is also commendable where most food are always kept fresh at point of picking up the food as we guessed the turn over for the food is also very high. I like especially the tepanyaki section where the prawns, chicken and vegetables are always served freshly cooked. The staff team is super friendly and thoughtful as well. We had the privilege of witnessing group birthday celebration performance they carried out during our time there. ALL the staff came together, some dance, some sang and clap to the birthday tune and it gave the hall a very family and community feel which is unusual in a hotel setting. Bravo to the staff. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience and went back 3 times within a span of a month

My mom is not an eater.. I mean she has restrictions to what she eats.We brought her to Carousel for her birthday Hi Tea on 15/9. I dont remember seeing her eat so much until yesterday. So, all it means is, the food were slendid. being a person who does not favor seafood much, she had a generous serving of prawns.The variety of buffet spread for hi tea was awesome! love the variety of salad and desserts. but I noticed one thing, the replenishment was a tad slow.. maybe the team may wanna improve on that. Overall, we had fun and all the staff were amazing :)Thank you Carousel team for making my mom's (and other's) Birthday a memorable one :

The buffet spread was brilliant! love the dessert most! wide variety of seafood selection.Quite Crowded even weekday for dinner. The birthday celebration performance was the most memorable moment for me it bring the whole restaurant atmosphere to max almost, Excellent !!!But some staff seem to be shy while perform and but it's normal.Overall experience awesome, if only that the staff was more attentive to diner by not keep talking to each others. Hand was raised for sometime to get the plate clear and the Indian wait staff with spec seem unhappy feel like i was disturbing his conversation with a colored hair female wait staff. this the only point that causes me rated this restaurant very good instead of excellent. Wish that there is some improvement in future

Love the ambience they create for birthday celebrations! My husband was extremely happy and satisfied with the food and the cake presentation. Love the vast selection available! Will definitely come back again!Thank you team Carousel

Spent an evening there with friends in Aug' 13 and what an evening. You could not ask for more food, choice, service and ambience the list is endless. I would recommend this restaurant to all, enjoy the experience I have, it's a night I'll never forget
5
In terms of variety of seafood offerings, Carousel offers the widest range of fresh shell fish and crustaceans. Especially the Lobsters, Oysters and many more. Do make reservations at least 2 weeks in advance, if not its basically packed full with diners every night, even weekdays
5
It was a beautiful and memorable night.The staff were friendly and very helpful. I should say one of the best service i've come across!We celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and with a surprised proposal ! Everything went as planned and was a success! I would like to thank Sherelin Kaur and her team for making this the best dinner I've ever had in Carousel! Excellent service Carousel! Will definitely visit you again

Thanks for making my hubby's birthday celebration a delightful one. The cake was a nice surprise and the 'singing crew' was a delight. My hubby loved the sashimi, prawns etc while I loved their dessert selections.Though it was our first visit there, we would like to recommend this place to all. Thanks again to the crew for their excellent service

Excellent service. Staff are friendly & attentive. Service is fast & prompt.

The staff are friendly, and the selections of food is great and very delicious. We love the wide variety - western, local, indian, malay, and especially the pastry and bread sections!
5
I was pleasantly surprised when we were given a private corner in the restaurant for us to celebrate our daughter's birthday. I made several special requests to make her birthday celebration a surprise one, the staff were able to accomodate. Not only that the birthday son were sung, complimentary cupcake was also given to my daughter. This restaurant has the best service.friendly, always smile to us and were so polite to meet to our requests. One food to describe the food: fabulous and delicious. I thought it was not a right place to celebrate a child's bday but I was wrong. She enjoyed herself very much for she was being treated like a princess. Thank u carousel for making her 7th birthday a very special one. Dont hesistate to celebrate your young children here

I had my wedding ceremony at the Royal Plaza on Scotts on the 12th of May 2013. It was a magical and beautiful ceremony and it would not have been possible without the fantastic service provided by Karlson Kim, the Customer Relations Manager of Carousel. Karlson went above and beyond his call of duty for my wedding. In fact, despite not being my wedding coordinator, the amount of effort and attention he put into my wedding makes my coordinatorâ€™s effort seem paltry in comparison.There were several instances when Karlson demonstrated his earnestness in going the extra mile. Through his collaborative nature and creative insights, he liaised with the pastry chef to create the most perfect and quintessential wedding cake. Furthermore, he demonstrated tremendous ingenuity and resourcefulness in dire situations such as when I wanted to purchase additional wedding favors from Gourmet Carousel, although it was closed due to renovation works. Even the minutest requests such as getting more ornate furniture for the solemnization ceremony were handle in the most professional manner possible.Karlson had made it possible for my wedding to be as perfect as how I had envisioned it. With that, I would like to sincerely extend my gratitude to Karlson for his assistance in making my wedding day an exceptionally special one.Thank You Karlson!Regards from an extremely happy client,Syazan

My family and I dined here for my parents' anniversary and we were wonderfully surprised by their mini cake to commemorate the occasion. I loved the food during the high tea- so many choices from kebabs to sushi to nasi lemak. My fave part was desserts! Not one, not two but 3 different choc fountains!!! Green tea and rose flavoured choc <3! Would love to eat there again! Definitely worth the price and personalised service - they even have a birthday dance with mini cakes for the birthday people :
4
My hubby and I went for buffet dinner. Its absolutely great for value. Excellent service with a special dancing performance for those celebrating birthday, ya, including my hubby^^It was a memorable night for us! Thank you for the cake! It's so lovely~Overall the foods are on high standard.But, please dont add too much MSG on soup;
5
Food was alright, we thought the sashimi was not really fresh. But desserts were great:)BUT best of all, their service was EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD! Special thanks to Carlson and Mathi who made our day:) You guys were fantastic! Paid much attention to small details and even went out of your way to make our date a memorable one! Your pleasant disposition made our visit to Carousel enjoyable! Definitely will be coming back to Carousel! Good job on the service, guys!!!Regards,Anniversary couple;
5
Spent an evening with friends at the carousel in Aug 2013, fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. The standard of food, service and ambience was to the very highest standard. The seafood you couldn't get fresher, international choices, every taste was catered for. We were celebrating my niece's 14th birthday, the staff singled her out bringing her a lovely birthday cake, singing and made her feel so special the magical memories will last her lifetime. This is why I would like to recommend the carousel restaurant, I think everybody should have the chance to experience a fabulous night like we had
5
This is one place I love coming back too went with wife and brother and sister in law and cant stop raving how good the food was .Thurs evening 28th August good value and excellent service

I personally feel the warmth of the staff when we first arrived.. it seems they were already expecting us.. Upon being sitted staff asked us whay drinks we wanted.. Never once feel neglected unles they were busy.Good wise was good...Certain dishes could have been better but overall it was really nice..Staff remember tiny details as what we stated on the comment box... Overall it was a great experience... and they followed up and asked us if everyting was ok.
4
Good spread of food. Friendly and thoughtful staff to prepare and celebrate our anniversary. What could be improved is the table positions. It looks cramped up and quite out of place. But overall it's a good place and pretty worth it for the amount. Seafood are rather fresh too.
5
Your staff are all very friendly and the service was excellent. One of your staff teach us how to dip the marshmallow in the stawberry fountain. She even take the food for us. The request from me to sing a bdy song for my gf was awesome. The foods were well served and the quality was marvellous. The enviroment of the Carousel was nice. I will recommend to family and friends about this restaurant. Im sure that ill come back again. And once more thanks for the bdy picture that was email to me.MARVELLOUS Carousel!
5
First time to visit Carousel and will surely return with my family. From the moment we stepped in, we were accorded superb customer service by their staff named "Karlson" who brought us to our seat and offered us the selections offered for the day. His warmth was the most welcoming experience we have ever received. The seafood section which offers lobsters, crab, salmon, etc was more than fulfilling, the dessert and other western food like steak were all sumptuous. Furthermore, they made it so special for the birthday celebrants to be given personal birthday cakes plus a song/dance greeting! Wonderful dining experience
4
The ambience is great. Easy to make online reservation. The staffs were attentive, polite and friendly. This is my first time there and will definitely be back. Will try the lunch and dinner buffet the next time around and will certainly recommend this restaurant to friends and relatives. One the best dining experience that I've had in my life
5
Always an excellent experience when dining with Carousel. Their lunch and high-tea buffets always have a wonderful variety of food to choose from. The service is also top-notch. The staff are all polite, friendly, and easy to talk to. This is my first time celebrating a birthday there and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Carousel gives the birthday person a complimentary cupcake. It was a nice touch and the birthday song was unique as well. My family was pleased with the entire experience, and you can definitely see us visiting it again
4
Carousel staffs are attentive and thoughtful. The dining experience is enjoyable. However, I find the lunch buffet menu can be better. For sweet tooths, the desserts are definitely a plus. They have an interesting way to celebrate birthdays, do look out for that too.
5
Tis my 4th time going back Carousel and is the 2nd time my family.The food are good with seafood spread like lobster, oyster, prawn, mussel etc,, Japanese food, indian food, Chinese, western food, fruits, cake and icecream corners. We choose to come back to this place because we felt the food are good, service super good, well spent. Their concept is very family oriented, the staffs are attentive, polite, we feel very much at home. Unlike other buffet restaurant, we need to rush for food or staff are not attentive enough. Today, my girl chose to go back the same place for celebration of her birthday Carousel staff even bother to train or practice a song and dance for the birthday gals/boys and prepared cake for them. Welldone Carousel. Keep it Up and you did well during these years! huh... last of all, I forget add on the minute we reached home, our family photo which Carousel helped us to take was emailed to us without delay.. Is so heartwarming

I had heard a lot of positive comments about Carousel but didnt have a chance to dine as the price to me was rather high for lunch. With so many recommendation, finally i arranged for the gathering here. Its the first time all of us to dine here, there's 18 of us. The experience was great! The staff are very friendly from the moment we walked in, the variety of food was a lot and the dessert were so nice. My two collegues were so touched to receive birthday cupcakes from Carousel staff. The only thing i would suggest is to extend the lunch hour longer as its only from 12pm to 2pm. The food was so nice and there so many varieties , i almost missed the dessert counter
5
Carousel had always been our first choice dinning when it comes to special occasion and celebration. My first visit to carousel several years back had left me with an unsaid wonderful experience that I never had in any other restaurants I patronise. The foods spread was fantastic ranging from seafoods, main dish,desserts down to beverages. We really enjoy the freshness of it's seafoods and there isn't a time that the buffets counter was not replenish. They really keep up to their standard that every visit was a memorable experience for me.They never fail to cheer our family and friends on every occasions we celebrate in their restaurant. Yesterday experience was the best, all the staffs put on a performance for those who celebrate their happy occasion in their restaurants. We was so please and entertain with their sincerity towards their guests.My sincere thanks to Karlson Kim, he was the person who served us years back which till today make me love this place due to his commitment and sincerity in serving his guests. All The Best Carousel .......... Keep Up Your Standard

Made a reservation online to celebrate our 5th year wedding anniversary. It was the first time for me and hubby to dine in Carousel after hearing so much positive reviews from friends and colleagues who had been there several times.The experience was great. The greeting staff guided us upon knowing it was our first time being there.The food spread( dinner) was great. We were spoilt for choices. The service crew were prompt and attentive.And when we thought we were wowed enough, a service crew came to us with a cupcake and wishes us happy anniversary. That was really a nice surprise, for a first timer like us.Definitely will return again to celebrate notable moments in life and will strongly recommend to others about Carousel. No regrets
5
I brought my family for a dinner at Carousel to celebrate my father's birthday. This is their first visit and I strongly believe the staffs of Carousel will be able to create the hospitality magic. Indeed the overall never fails their expectation and I am extremely pleased with my father saying that he enjoyed himself. Just like me, this will not be their final visit and we are planning for the next visit soon
5
We had a nice high tea buffet this sat in this restaurant to celebrate my boy's birthday. There is a good selection of hot food, seafood and dessert for a high tea. The kids loved the food selection and the free flow iced tea. They also provided free cup cake and the crew gathered and sang birthday song for my boy! They even emailed back the photo taken for us to keep this special moment. Excellent and creative services ! This is the 3rd time we were there and we certainly will come back to visit again
4
This is my second review of carousel but this time about their birthday specials. I was there on my birthday and even though it was a public holiday, ( eid) the reservations readily complied to give me a table for two! They stole my heart from there on. The high tea spread is a typical Singaporean food lover's galore- all the local favorites are there: sushi, sashimi, waffles, Rojak, scones, banana fritters and the list goes on! Towards the end of my meal, a staff brought a sweet cupcake with a candle and also took a picture of me in her iPad. Special moments captured! I received the picture via email the very night. All the staff are exceptionally friendly and warm. Thanks to Mary, pinky & karlson from carousel

Great Buffet, Great Service, Great Value for Money...Been to several buffet, still find that Royal Scotts Carousel still the best place for seafood buffet with affordable value of money for the spread of food.The service and the crews are very efficient and the manager still recognize me since my last visit.Thanks for everything. I will definitely recommend further and come back for more.Cheers

Decided to bring my cousin here for a birthday treat and definitely made the right choice! Made an online reservation, which was a breeze and it is commendable that they actually call you up the day of the reservation itself as a reminder/further confirmation. Although the selection of food was not very large (given the small space of the restaurant and some renovation works going on), the variety was still acceptable for me. I think what made up for the lack of variety was the quality of the food (fresh and tasty).the ambience and the amazing service. During our visit, they were having a Spanish/Ramadan cuisine promotion but also served other food such as chicken rice, japanese food, indian food and seafood. Tried everything except the chicken rice and indian food.My recommendations for the Spanish food would be its veal, beef and seafood paella. All three tasted so heavenly - the veal was tasty, the beef was sooo yummy and soft and I particularly liked how it melts and breaks into flakes in your mouth (reminds me of tuna flakes but more heavenly) and the seafood paella was really tasty, loved how the rice is rich in flavour. Also, the Spanish dessert/cakes were top-notch. They also had churros and I loved it but the chocolate dip that came with it wasn't really that nice (tasted like our hot chocolate drink). The churros tastes great on its own though but my suggestion for a better chocolate dip, would be from the chocolate fondue itself. It was interesting and something new for me that they had green tea chocolate fondue in addition to the common white and dark chocolate ones. I would say their green tea chocolate fondue is the best! Apart from the chocolate fondue, there are 2 other dessert tables and if you have a sweet tooth, you would not be disappointed. I loved the creme brulee, the bread and butter pudding and the overall cake selection was really good too. For the seafood, the lobsters, oysters, prawns, clams etc. were fresh and they have a pretty good range of condiments too. My overall recommendation would be the tuna though cause it's really really heavenly. It melts in your mouth and is sooo tasty and as far as i can remember, the quality of the tuna is the same as my first visit to carousel about a year ago. I had two helpings cause it was thaaat good. For the jap food, the sushi was decent and tasty enough but do not really have any recommendations as I only tried 2 sushi.Highlight of the night was that the staff actually put up a short dance performance while a Happy Birthday song was played and it was really entertaining as the chefs were also clapping and dancing at their respective spots. The staff carrying complimentary birthday cakes (cupcake) also waved sparklers during the song which is something new. Not sure if this is a daily thing though because it happened to be that there were like more 5-10 other people celebrating a birthday too. Service was personalized even further by staff going to each table to take a photo which was emailed promptly to my email account with a thank-you message and our photo with a cute birthday border as soon as we left the restaurant.The staff were attentive throughout the buffet, with our plates cleared promptly. Also, they were helpful and friendly and I was really glad with the overall service provided by the staff. Kudos Carousel staff!! Had a great night and will come back again :

It's a buffet. Just a typical buffet. No where near worth the price. I am not sure where the great reviews are coming from. Service was okay. Food was buffet food.
5
Great experience & worth the money (understand that it's located at the city area; so can't expect any cheaper :) ) . Made an online booking for anniversary. From the call centre to the servers; Excellent service! Food was awesome :) Definitely will come back for more :)
3
What they got right- excellent reservations system, proactive, precise and got all the details right. - relatively large variety - prompt service by polite and very efficient service staffWhat requires improvement- food selection in some sections leaves one feeling that you got leftovers from a buffet the night before- did not feel that it was value for money in comparison with other similar buffet lunches- everything felt very ordinary and the spread just never seemed to make us want to go back for more and more servings. The service efficiency really made it tolerable but wouldn't be enough for us to be going back anytime soon

I was here for Ramadan dinner yesterday. Buffet price was S$75++ per person. Spanish food promotion at inflated prices. At that price I would expect a very enjoyable dinner but sadly found it subpar. There was absolutely no wow factor in either food or service. I can't even tell friends of any standout dish as I do with other restaurants.Service started off well with courteous and friendly host guiding us to our table, our request for warm water was met with a smile and the server was efficient with top ups. It started to go downhill thereafter. For some strange reason, there was hardly any servers running around after 9pm. We had to crane our necks to search for them, the couple beside our table had to stand up and call out a server to be noticed. Imagine my surprise when I requested for tea and the only complimentary one was "Lipton". What about chamomile or Earl Grey? No ma'am, that's chargeable, our server mentioned. I was thinking why am I paying an arm and a leg yet the restaurant still wants more money out of me? I had the pleasure of dining at a 5-star hotel restaurant across the road from Carousel just a week ago and the difference was stark - lower prices, good quality and tasty food and best of all excellent service with complimentary camomile tea! I cannot even begin to comment on Carousel's quality of food, it gave me the impression of cutting corners. I was in Spain last month and I am familiar with Spanish food. The paella to be fair was good but the churros which I was so excited to try was kind of disappointing - oily and not so crispy with bitter chocolate sauce for dipping.There were a variety of cold dishes, great for appetizers but seriously how many people enjoy eating cold food? At the mains section, many dishes ran out. I lifted lid after lid, empty, empty, empty - what happened there? The Japanese station had a limited range of sushi, sadly not even a California maki. I took the last serving of sashimi, they probably didn't bother to check what has run out. I kept staring at some unfamiliar selection and the staff behind the counter stood like a statue and offered no help nor a smile on his face. His colleague who was pan frying what I took to be saba fish had a bored look on his face, as if he couldn't wait to finish his shift and get off. The same goes for the Indian station. I  have little knowledge on Indian cuisine and the variety of curry stumped me. Did the staff behind the station help me out? You guessed it - not even a smile or a "Can I help you ma'am?"When the bill came, the server requested me to sign on the paper receipt AND electronically via a handheld machine. I stared blankly at the machine and asked her how should I sign it? There was no electronic pen. She apologised and said it was currently in use by another guest. My dinner companion chuckled and suggested I use my fingernail. I did exactly that and ended up with an awful scrawl that didn't even resemble my own signature. I'm still perplexed by this experience to be honest. That sucked big time. When we left, staff at reception desk were busy with their heads down and only one staff said goodbye as an afterthought. The general feeling I get is lack of motivation with the staff and it shows. A more friendly attitude goes a long way. This is the service industry after all. Since I booked dinner online, it doesn't hurt to SMS guests after their dining experience with a "Thank you for dining with us. We look forward to welcoming you back". That was what I received from the restaurant across the road and I was left with a wow feeling. With Carousel, it was a flat feeling. My dinner companion summed it up in a few words - I am not coming back

Celebrated my birthday @ Carousel and we had the International Buffet spread. I have been to going to Carousel over the last few years so I am familiar with the food and what to expect!My recent visit really left us all very disappointed! Roast chicken was not cooked inside, flies over the cooked food, alot of the western food was over cooked and dry, meat was tough and tasteless. Asian section no better than food court standard, Indian curries were dry, meat tough!Overall I felt Carousel needs to review their standards. I do feel that either the chefs have changed or they are cutting corners to save money! I would not go back. There are better buffets in hotels within the same price range. Wake up Carousel

So after reading some of the great reviews we had to try this place out. It's quite expensive or at least we thought so. We went in for the Sunday brunch which came out to $58 sgd per person. There were items there but very randomly put together. The cold seafood section had salsa and Mediterranean side items like tabouli, baba ghanuj and hummus next to it. Just 4-5 kinds of sushi. The Chinese station already had some fried rice and chicken dish which wasn't hot. There was nothing there which made us go like on wow this is so good. It was more like, we are already here and paying, lets try to find something to eat.The surprising part was that soda like coke wasn't included as part of the buffet but extra. So for $115 for two people, there are tons of other good options.Also, there lunch is just from 12-2pm. So we got there around 1:15 and we were just taking it easy and trying out different things before we could settle down on what we wanted to actually eat more of they had already started clearing out things by 2pm. So it wasn't like they were letting people in by 2pm but more like get out of here by 2:15pm kind of mode. The waiters are all bustling around gathering all the silverware from the tables and taking away all the food. They even came to our table and took away our clean silverware while we were still eating. Terrible place.Please don't get suckered in by some exaggerated reviews and spend your hard earned money elsewhere. I regret going there

The minute my family and I set foot to the restaurant, we were immediately welcomed by a group of an amazingly warm staff! Since my dad works overseas and was back for a short holiday, they even came up with a ginormous cupcake given to him as his come-back celebration! My family and I were deeply awed by their service as well as their never-dying spirit of entertainment of the staffs most especially from Karlson (whom I believe is the manager) despite being full house. I was ecstatic for they serve with LOVE.Thank you so much to Mathi who made the effort of taking a photo of me and my family as well as sending it to me personally via email. To the butlers who served us always with a warm smile, not to mention to the amazing chef Robert for the scrumptious pasta

We had our buffet lunch and celebrated our son birthday in the restaurant. He was very surprised and delighted to be presented with a cake from the hotel staff.The spread is good and fresh, especially the sashimi counter, which is my favourite. I would like to return to try the dinner buffet on my birthday, coming soon ..... See you : )
5
My party of 12 had a reunion & the booking via e-mail was a breeze. The replies were responsive and the reception took note of my requirements. They even prepared a small cupcake with a "Happy Anniversary" chocolate. We were busy taking photos and enlisted the help of the servers. One of them was a photo enthusiast and he volunteered to help. The plates were cleared promptly, water filled regularly and as we chatted along, they even asked if we wanted decaf coffee. What a wonderful service!But the star appeal is definitely the food. The spread is generous and the quality top notch. The sashimi, oysters, shellfishes, lobsters were fresh and always replenished. The hot food section is very good too and there are so many types of soups. The dessert & pastry may not be as good as other top restaurants but they were not too shabby either. There is also a salad offering.The only negative in my opinion is the drinks-there is water, Bandung (rose syrup milk) & a coffee machine. No juices (unless I missed it).Overall, for about $80/pax, I would return again with my family for a special occasion.
5
It was easy to make an online reservation. This was not my first time to Carousel so I knew and expected that the quality of the food would be good. I was not disappointed. The staff gave us a warm welcome and farewell when we left. They also surprised me with a birthday cake and a lively birthday song, and even took our photograph. Thank you for a memorable experience!
5
Excellent buffet with seafood, Spanish, Indian, Japanese, Chinese and desserts. Very tasty food indeed. We went there to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary today. I strongly recommend this restaurant for special occasions as well as corporate parties.
5
Top quality buffet with a great mix of Western-Asian food. Seafood choice is overwhelming and very fresh
5
I had my birthday dinner and experience the best service from the staffs. The staffs presented me a cake and offered to take picture for me and my families. Their warmth and beautiful smiles makes my day. The restaurant has a cosy atmosphere. The best thing i like about the restaurant is the service is very efficient. The food are tasty with many varieties and the seafood are very fresh. If i really have to write something i liked least will be the Spanish delights. But it is because I am not used to eating Spanish food. Overall, i highly recommend this wonderful restaurant
5
Had my birthday lunch today, staff presented a birthday cake and sang a song. Thank you for making my day :)Great food and wonderful service staff. The staff are always so joyful and cheerful. Many varieties of food not sure what to eat. Continue to maintain such service
5
Excellent service, very warmth ambience. The staffs are very friendly and always put up their greatest smiles. Efficient service and very prompt! Good at surprises, was given a cake by the Carousel Team as my partner and I was celebrating our Anniversary. Great food, excellent service, nice ambience, felt warmth
5
Many varieties of different cuisines and meticulous services, my assurance you will enjoy here.We booked for 4 paxs for lunch and the management staff approached us with surprise offering 1 for free.Nice ambience and food arrangements are perfectly organised. They even presented my son a lovely cupcake for his birthday and photographed our family and emailed to us. My appreciationto staff and management. Value for money and highly recommended
4
For me its the varieties of high quality food & services. There are choices for everyone. Nice ambiance too. Brought some customers over lunch & they were equally very impressed with the selections of high quality food. If there is a flaw, then it would have to be the non inclusion of the drinks selection. Why stop there ? It would have been a 5 star .

This is not our first time at dinning at Carousel with my family especially with my mum in wheelchair. We make last minutes reservations thru Karlson and he do his best to accommodate and managed to get our favourite table to give easy access for my mum in wheelchair. The food is good but on that day 6 July, fried chicken is not been served….we missed our fried chicken………The customer service, we really like most is the warmth / whole hearted service that we received especially from Karlson Kim & Lina and of course his team was simply fantastic. I am sure I’ll be celebrating more loved ones birthday in Carousel. Well done and Thumbs up!Did I mentioned - The staff, especially Karlson and Lina are always very courteous and friendly THANK YOU to make my mum happy to dinning at Carousel

We had buffet lunch here for 5 people, food options were overwhelming! We focused on the fresh seafood, great variety! There was also a good variety of curry dishes on offer, and three tables of desserts! Towards the end of our meal, the staff came over to sing happy birthday for me, and gave me a little birthday cupcake (surprising touch!)
5
This was our third visit in 5 years and once again it was magnificent. We think great value for money. They allowed us to bring 1 bottle of wine free of charge and then $20SGD for each additional bottle (very reasonable) Food is fresh and plentiful and very tasty. So many options including superb seafood. The staff are tremendous and their service is of the highest order. You should always book just in case as it has been full every time we have dined there
5
Beautiful food, lots of variety and great service. It does get very busy tho so go early or share a table. The staff are always very courteous and friendly
5
We stayed at the RP and enjoyed our breakfast at Carousel very much, lots of variety, every thing was freshly made and baked, presentation of food very nice, staff also very professional and welcoming.

My family went to celebrate my wife's birthday at Carousel and it was well-worth it!The buffet price was S$73 Net but I had a Royal Connect Membership card which entitled me to 15% discount, so it was reasonable.We tried several other buffet restaurants Todai and Kiseki but the stand-out establishments would be The Carousel and The Line at Shangri-La Hotel as the best.I liked the baby lobster, Oyster and mussels. The desert were pretty much standard but acceptable.Hope they will include soda, iced tea or juice free for their patrons.Over-all, was a good dinner

It is quite hard to find halal food in Singapore. Usually, you have to search quite high and low for it. Imagine when I got to know that Carousel serves halal food!! We tried the buffet lunch and the quality of food is superb. Lots of variety to choose from, and make sure you save some space for the cheese platter. They are absolutely good quality cheeses. The whole team of staff really tried their best to please each and every customer with their polite and attentive service. We loved it! And as we stayed at this hotel, the breakfast was absolutely good quality too. Would definitely come back here again for their buffet when there is a chance to stay here

Good breakfast spread:western (bread, cereals, baked beans, grilled potatoes & tomatoes, waffles), chinese (noodles, dumplings) malay (nasi lemak) indians (roti prata) and japanese (miso). I loved the dumplings. They were very yummy. tip 1: a little bit on a high side, may be because of its location, Orchard Roadtip 2: child above 4 will be charged as adulttip 3: do not hope for a nice scenary while having breakfast but ambiance was okay tip 4: service was good and staff were attentive to your requesttip 5:the restaurant is a halal certified restauran

Carousel is the favourite choice when we think of buffet. It has a wide spread of tasty choices. The seafood line is extremely fresh. The dessert is fantastic. The restaurant staff are friendly and provide excellent service. Karlson, the Customer Relations Manager is very helpful. He will do his best to accomodate each time we make last minute reservations
5
I had my birthday celebration at Carousel and it's one of the most memorable birthday celebration I've ever had.They gave an excellent service that is really beyond my expectations. Superb food and great ambiance. What I really like most is the warmth and whole hearted service of the restaurant manager Karlson Kim keep it up! Thumbs up
5
This is not my first time at Carousel but the first in celebrating my fiancée’s birthday. From the point of reserving via the hotel’s website & the day of arrival, everything went smoothly. By the time, we reached for dinner, all the food was freshly prepared. The customer service we received from Karlson Kim & his team was simply fantastic. They managed to get us a quiet table & surprised my fiancée with the birthday cupcake. Food was plenty & delicious as usual, nothing short of expectations. In summary, I am sure I’ll be celebrating more loved ones birthday in Carousel. Well done!
5
Wide food selection ❤ yummy dessert- i didnt know where to start. You must try the fondue. But the key of the whole restaurant experience was the attentive staff and five star service. Kudos to the restaurant manager Karlson Kim for the impeccable high level of service from the time we entered until we left. Although the place was packed, he ensured we were entertained and attended to. We will definitely be back!
5
Decided to celebrate our one year anniversary and our baby one mth old. We booked for 3 ppl. They ushered us in and made us comfortable as we had a pram. The servers were quick to top up our drinks and were able to accede to my requests for warm water for baby milk. The food was fantastic. The chicken rice was awesome. The seafood was fresh and the selection of desserts were sumptuous. Plus they gave us a cute cupcake to end our celebration.I will definitely return for our 1 yr old baby birthday. Mummies, there is a baby room on the second floor

Carousel breakfast buffet has a wide array of breakfast to suit your taste buds from Western to local breakfast. That coupled with friendly, helpful and most of all polite staff to help you start your day right every day.
5
I had a blast! Customers service is more than excellent. Food is really great! Everyone is friendly, professional and ready to help guests with whatever we need. Its an experienced that last the entire course of my visit. Thanks!
5
My guilty pleasures are fish, shrimp and fresh oyster. Definitely, my favorite seafood. You will never get disappointed as this restaurant will give the wide range of seafoods that you are looking for. PLUS - not to mention the great service and great staff :-)
4
What makes this high tea really popular is the variety of authentic local dishes. A real winner with its fine range of selection from satay, dim sum to local malay deserts like kueh dadah, it's got them all. The service was adequate and the ambiance was rather bustling. However, there's a private dining area if you'd prefer something more quiet. Overall, I found it was good value for the price and one should give it a shot at least once
5
I recently spent a lazy Sunday afternoon at this reputable restaurant at Royal Plaza on Scotts. We were placed in a private room because of the size of our party, 14 of us. The room had ornate high-back chairs, a long marble-top table with a huge chandelier hanging above. Intimate music blasted from speakers above. The restaurant was packed with the usual Sunday crowd of families and food lovers! The halal-certified restaurant served a sumptuous spread of local cuisine, from all corners of Asia. Laksa, roti john, ice kacang, Indian rojak, etc. and other dishes are lavishly laid out in four stations. Overall, it was a Sunday well-spent with good food and great company
5
Hello dear staff and management of carousel...Just dropping in to say a quick hello however just read one of the comments and I beg to disagree. I’m a creature of habit. I not only frequent the same restaurants, but I also order the exact same thing most of the time. Unsurprisingly, I have my list of favorite bread& butter restaurants in Singapore. Having said that, I do like discovering other good restaurants, and had the opportunity to do so recently, courtesy of Carousel. Your company is one of the world’s best management, and pride themselves on specialising in high quality service. In particular, i really enjoy my stay specially when i started to eat Carousel's BREAD AND BUTTER! HEAVEN

Went to carousel on the last night of our honeymoon purely because of the reviews on trip advisor. We could not have been more disappointed. Very expensive at 90 dollars per head and every meal I chose was cold, lukewarm at best. The waiting staff didn't even offer us drinks, so god knows what they do for their 10% service charge, as it's a buffet. Awarding two stars for the desserts. As my wife enjoyed them.If your from the UK, then compare this to somewhere like jimmySpices but for 50 quid a head.
5
I had a blast! Coming to this restaurant is one of my best experience. Excellent service, great food, friendly staffs, great ambiance, what more can you ask for! Next time i'll visit singapore i will definitely visit your place again, it is worth it! thank you guys
4
One thing I love about carousel is their great service. One could never go wrong about going to this place. Once you entered the vicinity you can assure that they guarantee a good time. The food is awesome, fresh seafood could never go wrong. The vibe in the place is always positive that is why I totally recommend to anyone who just wants to eat good food and escape the daily stress in life. Plus, it is totally worth every penny I spent. thanks to everyone at Carousel for giving me and friends such a great time. Keep up the good work! God bless
5
July of 2012 I was on a three day vacation at singapore.. I got a chance to dine in one of the most talked about restaurants in the city, Gourmet Carousel. Service staff were amazing given their enthusiastic approach to us..Food was awesome. I personally loved their seafood counter. I would definitely recommend this one to first time travelers in Singapore
4
There's even Halal food. The dinner buffet has a lot of food option and the quality is really good. I love the seafood and there's really value for money. Even the breakfast buffet has a lot of really good options
5
Probably the best buffet in Singapore. The seafood is worth the price of the buffet. It is fresh and amazing. The carvary roast beef or lamb is cooked to perfection. Excellent value. Reservations are a must.
5
The best restaurant i ever been so far , the foods and cleanness are excellence , the breakfast is delicious ,the services is mature and polite ,hope and wish i can have some good time there once again .
4
The quality and variety of the food at the breakfast buffet is quite good -- as is the lunch menu. Carousel gets pretty busy, but the service is good.
5
It's our second time around to visit Carousel. Me and my Husband really enjoyed. We loved the Italian spread as it tasted very authentic.
Great service Karlson and the rest of the Team. We'll definitely see you again :)

Went on a sunday @ 7pm for dinner. The whole place was very crowded with large groups of family celebrating. Apparently, this is one if the rare place that serve Halal international buffet, which is why it is so popular. We could hear children running about. Some family even brought infants, and you could hear all the crying of uncomfortable infants and children calling for attention. I felt like I was in some kind of family restaurant instead of a buffet which cost around SGD70 plus. If you do not want to experience too much noise, maybe consider weekdays.For me, the food was way too salty, especially the prawns. The beef and the shepherd pie had to be washed down with loads of water. They serve whole cakes for dessert, you just need to cut the portion that you want, good side : you get to control your portion. Bad side about this: some people just dig carelessly, and the cakes all looked like they are half smashed. This is one big spoiler, as dessert was my favourite part. Service was alright, with water glasses filled when half drank, that's all. No stopping to ask if you are ok with the food. Or asking how's your evening. . Our anniversary cake was given only at the point when we paid the bill and going off. Obviously, the forgot about it and realise it only in the end. So we end up with a small cake boarding the MRT. But frankly speaking, paying almost the same amount of price, I preferred Melt The World, which has better atmosphere and more quiet

Celebrate life! There is no need for a special occasion in order to come and enjoy buffet at carousel.If you are like my friend ans I who eats to satisfy their palette and not their stomach, CAROUSEL is "the" place to be. Sure, it's quite pricey, but it is worth every penny. From salad-seafood-meat-veggies-dessert, its just fantastic. And of course,their staff are very friendly,attentive and accomodating,and I can tell you exactly that in a place/country like Singapore, it's not cery common.So,if you want to splurge a little on lunch or perhaps have a sumptuos dinner, go to Carousel. :
5
This is the only place I know where you will have a good breakfast with lots of variety! Even their lunch buffet and high tea are excellent!! Make sure to book ahead. Stayed here once during Ramadhan, they have the "sahur buffet" and I was one of them who managed to wake up and head downstairs.
5
Of course, double thumbs up for the great ambience, wonderful food always and their awesomely friendly staffs will be first talked about whenever i mentioned Carousel! They make us feel at home and appreciated as a customer. I have been to their Dinner buffet more than few times and was never once been dissapointed with their level of service. CAROUSEL will always be our number 1 choice for fine dining at a casual level. We will definitely be back again, thank you! :
5
Decided to dine at Carousel after much contemplation between a japanese or an international buffet. This was the second time dining at Carousel; it was for my anniversary with my girlfriend. Carousel provide a great variety of finest international buffet dishes. If you're sick of the formulaic spread of buffet in Singapore, Carousel is a must-try! They were generous in replenishing the food; at no point in time was there any empty food trays. Service and hospitality was magnificient. Staffs, managers and chefs are really warm and friendly; my girlfriend and I felt really welcome. They even provide surprises for customers (i.e singing of birthday song). It would really be an excellent choice of place to dine in with your loved ones. Special thanks to Chef Robert and Manager Karlson Kim for the wonderful experience. 5-Star, A must-try!
5
We stayed at this hotel and the breakfast was suburb, something for everyone. I am fussy with my eggs, but there were cooked to perfection. The service was top notch!
3
The food here is good, it's a help yourself buffet however it's a little expensive and you can get as good a meal within a few hundred yards walk for a lot less.
That said its popular especially with the locals
5
Carousel at Royal Plaza Hotel not only caters variety of international sumptuous dishes but also offers perfect delight from the staffs, the service, the ambience and those lobsters that made me wanna come back again! Highly recommended! They really deserve to be named the best buffet in Singapore
5
Its My 2nd Time Dining At Carousel.For Their Dinner Buffet.And Im Here To Celebrate My First Wedding Anniversary.We Were Greeted With A Welcoming Smile From The Staff At The Reception, And That's Definitely A Great Start To My Wonderful Night.My Overall Experience, From Service, To Food, To Ambience, And Staff.Everything Was Exceptionally Awesome.Thanks To Mr Karlson And His Team, For Suprising My Hubby And Me, And Wishing Us Well For Our Occassion. Its A Dining Experience I'll Always Remember.Thanks
5
Carousel is one of the best buffet in singapore, I always start with the cold dishes, the salmon shasimi ,sushi,prawns, lobsters, scallops, followed by lots of salads and beautiful dressing,then move on to the local dishes,western dishes and lately the northern indian garlic naan is fantastic!Can go on and on, cheese,fondue, bread pudding, chocolate mouse and the fantastic creme brulee,I highly recommend to try Carousel! The excellent services, the staff actually remembers the customer's name they are very friendly staff and I love all of them!If you have a birthday surprise for any one, Carousel is also one of the best to look at,they will arrange beautiful cupcakes, they write and create their own Carousel Birthday songs.Just lovely to just being able to enjoy breakfast , lunch or dinner!Special thanks to Tina, Michelle, Carson, Mahdi, Lena, Ben, Jas, Shahira and many more!!Thank you for making each and every reservation a Success!!!Thumbs UP!!

16 of us had Carousel dinner on Saturday. Food was amazing! Absolutely love the desserts. Couldn't stop eating the Jivara Chocolate Diplomat with Oreo Crumb. Service is excellent. Staff was prompt, helpful and pleasant. Especially Karlson Kim the Customer Relations Manager who goes the extra mile to accommodate to the customers needs and make us feel very welcome. Thank you Karlson and team for the wonderful Carousel dinner experience. =
5
absolutely great execution on service,service frm the heart. I felt important as they ALL greeted me by name.i had planned for a surprise bday for my hubby and indeed he was surprised. Great management. Great servers. Great cooks. Great ambience. Wat else can one ask for. While ur there,look for the manager,karlson. The man whos gonna ensure ur dining experience is one u'll nvr forget!
5
We have eaten here for breakfast over several stays and each time is as good as the last. Your cup never goes empty and the staff are always polite. The omlette's are great and there is no problem if you like them big. I would think there would be no way that you could not find something you like to eat here.
5
I like the variety of the food. start from cereals , fruits , salads , hot food : Asian, Indian and mix section. if your breakfast is included to your stay at the hotel then the best breakfast among all the hotels I have visited so far. The price for individuals are S$ 25-28 plus service and taxes
5
Today, two of us went to Carousel to celebrate our 5th year anniversary. Wonderful experience I think. They never fail to impress me in the last 3 years. Today, there is some improvement on the desserts section and Japanese foods section which are glad.Besides, the staffs here are amazing. Despite my last minute request, the manager and his team still managed to give us some surprise to remember. I would love to come back many times more in the future :DRegarding the food, they are all exceptional
4
Went several times as company events. The seafood are fresh and desserts are beautifully presented. I always have a pleasant experience there.
4
So many choices. Impossible to try everything in the spread without stomach bursting by the end of dinner. Loved their ice-cream, very good!
4
Great place for a good selection of buffet. Liked the fresh seafood... yabbi and roast bar had great cuts and mashed. Not a place to go for a romantic dinner, as due to good selection and price, is normally packed.
4
Liked the food, not the price!
Breakfast is 30 Sing dollars.
Starbucks is 50 meters away with good food choices at a fraction of the price.
5
Sea food spread is super, whole salmon is fresh, live oyster, lobster and many more, must try the dessert, yummy bread and butter pudding, two color chocolate fountain with more than 10 condiment,
5
My hubby and I love Carousel buffet so much. He celebrated my 29th birthday here. It's really place for celebration.The seafoods was fresh and delicious. Apart front that, the pasta was so nice prepared by the Carousel chef. Exceptional.... So much selection to choose on. The desserts are magnificent.The service was tip top. I also surprised by the cute cupcake and taylor birthday song.I really enjoyed myself that night
5
Normally I don't care to eat in Hotels, but in this case I do often.The food is really exceptional and I've had many meals here.The Breakfast is exceptional, but do not look for Pork items like Pork Bacon, as I mentioned this hotel is owned by the Sultan of Brunei.However the selection is unbelievable and covers many international favorites. There is of course an egg chef that will make any kind of egg dish you would like.The coffee and juice attendants are extremely attentive as well
5
The place was just overwhelming and spoilt with choices. So many selections and you don't know where to start. It is impossible to try everything, even though you have a good-sized stomach. Food was delicious, and well worth your money if you could spend longer time inside
4
My second visit to the Carousel buffet. The selection of food is very good and you could not come away saying you were hungry. The beef was still a little raw - not sure what this is all about. Seafood continues to be a big hit. Price is an issue if you are on a budget - $160 for two with taxes. The creme brulee is still very good. You need to book - a few people were turning up in hope of a table only to be disappointed. Finishes at 10.30 pm. Staff are friendly and relaxed
4
Carousel at Royal Plaza is doing very well with their hi-tea buffet, but you could never neglect their seafood buffet dinner as well. I went there for farewell dinner with friends on a Saturday night. We made the reservation online couple weeks ago, you will never be able to get a seat without advance reservation as it is really HOT!Although Im not a real seafood lover, I still get impressed at the buffet counter. Tiger Prawns, Salmon, Live Oyster, Lobster, Alaska Crabs..you name it, you get it! After few rounds of raw stuffs, we carried on trying those main courses and desserts until our tummy couldnt afford more! However, the atmosphere is a bit too noisy and they are squeezing the seatings. Perhaps the restaurant wants to accomodate as much as they could and try to maximize the dining capacity. I can understand that, but they should have worked out some solutions to prevent being over-crowded.Large variety, freshness and high standard of hygiene. Although $75++ (weekends) is defintly not a cheap deal, but it worth to give a try
5
Great place for a small celebration. Good spread of favourites from Appetiszers, Mains to Desserts. You can create your own courses with the buffet spread. The quality has not been compromised since my first visit almost 15 years ago.
5
Really nice breakfast, with every type you could ask for : asiatic, european continental... really good quality.
I also enjoyed the warm welcoming and service of waiters.
5
The buffet dinner was great ... Just that u need to book it a month in advance for Christmas dinner.
4
This buffet deserves the glowing reviews but be careful. As of January 2013 the facade of the hotel is under renovation and I frequently hear jackhammers near the windows when i walk past. I am sure the new look will be terrific since design is one of this hotel and restaurant's many strengths
4
I was staying in the Royal Plaza hotel and decided to have my dinner in the buffet restaurant of the hotel. Good choice! There is an enormous variety of cuisines to choose from India, Malay, mediteranian, Japanse and a large selection of desserts .The seafood buffet I found the most impressive with plenty of lobsters, crab, oysters etc to choose from.Service is excellent and price -to Singaporean standards- reasonabl
5
no wonder they keep racking up the awards - the range of offerings at this smargasboard would be almost impossible to beat - sashimi and seafood on tap - which was where I spent my energy - and then the carvery - wow! One very cool extra was the fondant fountains pick your fruit and coat with the chocolate of your choic
4
This restaurant is a place to go in Singapore if you want to have the choice.Indeed, you will be able to eat oysters, sushis, pastas, Indian and Indonesian specialities, European pastries for dessert...There are not many European tourists there, but more Singaporean or Malaysian and Indonesian consumers.The place is quite noisy and on Saturday night many anniversary are celebrates.The waitress Katsuri was very friendly and professional!Prices on Saturday night are the most expensive one, it costs me almost the same price as the room's for one night
4
We celebrated our 23rd wedding anniv. in Singapore. And while planning our activities and where to dine at our anniversary, we learned about Carousel in the internet as "the best buffet restaurant in Singapore". So as soon as we arrived, after checking in at our hotel, we immediately went to Carousel at Scotts Road to make our reservation for dinner the following day. The receptionist were very accommodating. The buffet comes with wide variety of international and local menus. The sea foods were at it's freshest. Love it! We've got to taste variety of cuisines. Good for food trippers like us. The desserts were also very good with fresh fruits, 2 kinds of chocolate fondue among others. Though some of it do not really taste good, but you can satisfy your sweet tooth with the rest. I like their cutlery holder, unlike in other buffet restaurants we've been to where you have to leave your spoon and fork on the table napkins. The service is good. The staff were alert to clear the plates and to attend to our other needs. We were glad to dine at Carousel. When in Singapore, try Carousel.. it may be pricey but it's worth it
5
I definitely regret missing out on the dinner itself and had the consolation of having breakfast there. Dinner on the weekend itself warrants an early reservation otherwise you would be stuck behind 13 guests on the waiting list like us. Room service and breakfast comes from the same kitchen which shows us what we had missed. The breakfast comes with a wide spread of local, international, vegetarian (basmati pilau for breakfast!), fruits, breads and more. I will definitely return for the dinner buffet itself.
4
My son loves the sashimi section!I m not a sahimi person but I do love the dessert sectionLots of varieties The seafood were fresh Staffs were friendly n helpful tooOverall, a very pleasant experience though it was our 1st visit and we reached there late at 130pmWill definitely visit agai
5
Ate breakfast here during my week long stay, large variety of Western,Malay, Indian, Chinese dishes.Truly delicious.
4
They serve international buffet dinner, good value, good food from all over the world. From japanesse food to italian pasta, i like their choco fountain the most.
4
Dine with wife here..love the dessert..superb..cold dish were good with oyster bar always having the longest queue..go for the dinner slot...
4
I like the choice (incredible) and the quality.
A lot of fruits are available but not all the time fresh fruits.
5
Nothing comes close to Carousel's buffet spread. We are spoilt for choices from Japanese food like sushi and sashimi, cold seafood, eastern to western food. The chef will cook the pasta the spot. The desserts especially the bread pudding is a must-have. The service is always good. The only minus point is the place is always full and can be noisy at times especially during lunch and dinner
4
I am now gonna share with you some helpful buffet tips: 1. Starve yourself a little beforehand. 2. Go easy on the rice and bread. They're a waste of space. 3. You're paying a lot for an international buffet, eat more things you don't normally get outside. 4. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSER
5
We dined in Carousel for breakfast for 2 mornings whilst we were staying at the hotel. The variety and quality of the buffet was awesome and the selections varied the next day.We only had one night to dine in Singapore and decided to just eat in the restaurant again rather than head back out. We were so glad we did as again, the meal, a buffet, was spectacular! There were so many different options to choose from and all of it was prepared to perfection. The service was great also each time we were in the restaurant.Would certianly recommend you pay Carousel a visit
5
If you did not like the food served you would have to be very hard to please. The food was fresh, plentiful. I went across the road to one of the real up market hotels for a meal and hand on heart came away very disappointed with regard to their seafood. The selection at the Royal Plaza on Scotts was incredible
3
dinner is ok, I still think SG$89 is still in high side. It would be a heaven for shell seafood lover as there are many choices. But breakfast for SG$33 is really pricy, it can't really justify this price with the type of food that they offer. Not even an egg benedict. Walk across street from the bridge to Far East shopping plaza. They offer local toast breakfast for SG$
4
Came by to try this place out after the spouse raved about it after a prior visit with colleagues. Had a weekend high-tea. Reservations are necessary, and queues were forming up just before high-tea opened at 3:30 PM. Many patrons made a beeline for the seafood first and immediately. The sashimi, salmon, boiled prawns, mussels and clams at the seafood station were pretty good, though within 15 minutes of opening, the largest prawns had been snapped up, and the ones that remained thereafter for the rest of the afternoon were of more modest sizes. The other stations were quite varied, with the laksa and nasi lemaks worth a mention especially if you're not familiar with these local fare. None of the rest of the items I thought were really standouts though they were serviceable. Service on the other hand was uniformly excellent. The wait staff were attentive, very polite and used plates were cleared very quickly
4
heard about it bt never been there. would like to try it mysself after so many great ratings from friends n colleagues
5
We had the most divine dining experience! My family and in-laws went to Carousel for dinner and were blown away by the amazing and mouthwatering variety with a range of exotic dishes they served. The red wine list was delightful too. Great value for money...
5
Went there during the Spanish festival. Alot of varieties, from fresh seafood varieties (lobsters, oysters etc), to pasta stations, to seafood paella, asian section and plenty more. particularly loved the mini creme brulee in the dessert station.
5
All kinds of food available. Sushi, sashimi, pasta, Indian food, dim sum, desserts. Most importantly, good and prompt service.
5
Great Sunday brunch, really good value for money. Great service and something for everyone's taste. Ask about 'take your own' wine. Used this place quite a few times, evenings and lunch but Sunday brunch is the most enjoyable.
5
A wide variety of international food is available. Desserts are mouthwatering and you will probably eat everything and won't want to think of the calories in it. I love the chocolate fountain the most!
4
My teenage daughter elected to have her birthday group here for a buffet dinner and when you can satisfy a bunch of 18 year olds you are doing well. Excellent and friendly service,fantastic buffet (albeit a touch pricey)of the highest quality and great atmosphere. Is this really a coffee shop............puts some restaurants to shame
4
My friend gave me a treat at carousel restaurant last week.Have been to different types of buffet in KL and also have been to 2 other halal buffet in Singapore.When compared to other halal buffet in Singapore,this is the better one.I was there on saturday for lunch.The restaurant was full.Must reserve early. Their seafood is fresh and taste gd. Didn't try much of the asian dishes though.Roasted chicken and live station pasta were gd and their ice cream,bread and butter pudding and chocolate cake were fantastic. Rest of the food are of average taste.Their service was excellent.The staffs were always there to attend to us and quick to remove our plates. It's a place to visit if you feel like having buffet once in a while
4
Visited Carousel weeks ago for high tea, as part of my wife's birthday celebration. I shall not reveal the "mushy" details here but what I would say was that Carousel did a fantastic job! Long queue was formed before the time and the staff obviously noted the special arrangements under the reservation. We were seated and everything was going as planned. However I was surprised when staff and even their manager approached me for more detailed planning of the surprise. It is a shame I had not noted their names, I was pleasantly amazed that they were interested in the plan and took care to approach me only when it was 'safe', in fact, they seemed more excited than I was. So with the careful planning, and with the staff knowing what my plan was, I waited for the right time and executed the plan together with the staffs' collaboration and we brought the surprise to the table. As for the choices of food, it was high tea and it was understandably not as widespread as lunch or dinner. It was still good with some fresh seafood and pastries and dessert. The food was nice, made better by the service.Well done Carousel, along with their happy people who are sincere in their roles, while serving the patrons. Put everything together, and you get the Best Buffet Restaurant award winner
5
We had friends gathering in this restaurant! One of them was a Muslim and said "never had such yummy seafood before!". The restaurant staff was friendly and attentive... Now the restaurant has increased the tepanyaki counter, this is some different!Tips: just go for seafood and definitely value for money
4
I tried the breakfast and lunch buffet..... Those are great food! The food that they provided is varied....
5
We had breakfast there every morning while in Singapore with excellent different cuisnes and we also had dinner one day and the buffet was amazing (seafood, malaysian, japanes, indian and chinese cuisines, etc.)
4
I am not really a buffet person but I was taking a group of people out to dinner. Man, it was great. Everything you can think of to eat and the quality and flavours were fantastic. It was also packed so please remember to book.
3
Went there a few times for buffet lunch & high tea. Variety of the buffet spread was indeed good. However the service level should be improved. I had to request for a few times to change for a clean plate & water to be refilled.
4
Carousel is always innovating ... careful of the price. The last spanish event buffet was SGD 90++
Buffet is always very generous and staff is very good.
They have smaller room that makes the place not to noisy is you are just a few.
5
If you are keen on seafood, the buffet at Carousel, Royal Plaza on Scotts is not to be missed. There is a great variety, hot and cold, raw and cooked, you name it, they've got it. The desserts are to die for! Overall, the food presentation is A

This is my first visit to the restaurant after hearing so many good comments about it. We were celebrating my wife birthday on that day and wanted to give her a surprise. So I specifically told the staff that when we called for the bill then they presented the complimentary cake. However to my disappointment this was not so, I needed to check on it several time after we had asked for the bill and it took a while before the cake was deliver to our table. It totally lost the element of surprise as my wife was wondering what we were waiting for after paying the bill. It may be too busy for the staff to pay attention to my tiny request as the restaurant was busy, but I think it is very important for the staff to be attentive to the guest special request, especially on this special occasion as the time once passed cannot be unwind

This place is a haven for those whose taste buds swing a little towards the Malay/Indonesian cuisine. There was an extensive selection of gravy and desserts sticky rice cakes, red bean soup, gado gado etc. the popiah rolls were tasty. Didn't quite enjoy the sushi and the English patisserie though even though they're my usual high tea favorites. On a whole, it's was a good experience
4
The buffet commenced at 6.30 pm and people were already lined up when we got there at about 6 pm. An extensive buffet spread - seafood, cheeses, hot dishes, Chinese and Indian choices amongst others. I have to say that the beef was far too underdone even for those who don't mind a bit of blood. Vegetarian Indian was very good. Usual array of desserts, but the creme brulee was particularly delicicious . Staff were very attentive and friendly, the water glass was filled regularly and plates removed promptly. Sadly though there is the usual 'feeding frenzy' at the seafood area - the inability of some people to wait patiently in line rather than push in is always upsetting to see. There is plenty of food for all. The cost for three of us after 10% discount paying by DBS card was $238 so you need to factor this in
4
The place is very modern but all the food available in this buffet is good and fresh.Service is also very good there.We owe that to the GM who is by far the best host in Singapore.If you don't expect Raffles hotel type of setting, I would recommend this restaurant
5
Plenty to eat, they serve Japanese, Indian, Malay, Western, Chinese. The only bad about it, it's very noisy.
3
Although still Expensive during my visit in Singapore,They are all nice,service is good.
3
For the price, the buffet spread is extensive and offers a very good value for money. Impressive presentation and also a nice atmosphere. Always crowded and very popular.
4
excellent. reasonable price and delicious food.good environment.
4
went for tea time and it had a fantastic variety of desserts!! my favourite..
4
Great food selection, atmosphere and quality. A bit pricy but valua for money.

Went here for a Sunday breakfast buffet and found the food to be very good. The have a nice selection of breads, juices, western food, fruits, cheeses, meats, and asian food. I had a sampling of everything and nothing disappointed. Make sure to try the fresh-squeezed orange juice and go early (before 9am) to have the greatest selection. The replenish but after 9am things finish quickly.Atmosphere was good as expected but I found the service to be sub-par, it seemed as though they had a lot of staff in training
5
Take our advise and if you want a great meal in Singapore go here! The staff were very attentive and our water glass was never empty! It cost us around AU$104 for us both and the aray of food was plentiful including seafood, asian cuisine, roasts and the desert bar was to die for! 3 different types of chocolate fountains! yummm!!! We will certainly be back there next time we are in Singapore thats for sure. Thanks to all the staff for there help and attention
5
Had a buffet dinner on Saturday during my stay on 16.6.2012. Great selection with high quality food from this award winning restaurant. Paid about SGD75++ per head but worth for the food on the table especially the seafood counter with selection of lobster, crab, prawn, salmon & fresh oyster. Highly recommended for weekend dinner. Weekdays cheaper but less seafood selection. Tips : You can check the food list offer at buffet from their website
5
Visited the cafe on 27 June with my wife and son. It was my son's 7th birthday. We told the staff about this. Shortly, they brought him a cupcake and sang him a birthday song. Appreciate that. And this does not come with additional cost.Food was great. Good spread of local delights such as Indian, Malay, Chinese, Japanese food.Waitresses are attentive and quick to clear used plates and replenish the food.Great job!!
5
No doubt in my mind that this is the best Buffet in Singapore. Great Quality and great variety every night. Thinking of the food I have there makes me feel like picking up the phone to make a reservation
5
They have a good spread of fresh oysters, pacific lobsters, clams. Best seafood spread, There are many choices of different regional cuisine. Love the 3 types of chocolate fountains, white, dark and milk chocolate, Good Service, must reserve so you don't have to wait.
4
A group of us ate here last week & we were impressed. We got before 6.30 & noticed the place filled up quickly. The buffet spread was great. Well worth a try, you'll like it.
5
Its not the biggest hotel resto around, but the choices are abundant!
5
Great place to enjoy halal food in Singapore.
Provide pastry selection as well.

For our last evening in Singapore, we decided to go to Carousel, the buffet restaurant within Royal Plaza on Scotts.Even on a Monday night it was very busy by 7.30pm, with no spare tables. Luckily we reserved that afternoon so were shown straight to our table. So key suggestion is reserve early.The food selection is extensive - what sets this aside from other buffets though is the large seafood selection. Half lobsters were stacked, plus copious quantities of large prawns (shimps), oysters (I think Pacific), clams and huge fish. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I sampled most things here and all were delicious.The rest of the food would suit any palate - there are spicy indian dishes, more classic Singaporean and south asian selections, plus more western choices (from Yorkshire pudding through pastas - blanched on demand, to roast chicken). We also had a choice of two delicious soups (I tried the mushroom).The dessert choice was amazing - there are three dessert stations. One is mainly fruits (everything from apples, oranges and grapes to bananas and dragon fruit); another is petit fours and classic asian sweets, and the third is ice creams, mashmallows, fruit pieces and three chocolate fountains (white, milk and dark).Although the place was full, the only time we needed to queue at the food stations was at the chocolate fountains - obviously very popular!Service for two, plus a Tiger draught and an orange juice came to S$171 including taxes.Overall, this was a very enjoyable buffet - we noticed that almost all the guests were Singaporean so I'm guessing even the locals think it's pretty good!A couple of points raised by other reviewers: Firstly, this is a buffet restaurant so of course it is self service. The wait staff looking after drinks and clearing the dishes were very efficient - we had no problems attracting their attention. Secondly, to the person complaining about 'fake' Parmesan: it is labeled (correctly) Parmesan because that's what it is - it does not pretend to be Parmigiano-Reggiano
2
Self service chaotic and bad distributed . The quality is very low except the sushi area. The raw fish and lobsters are not fresh.the sweets part is very poor.the fruits part is insufficient .i founded a fake "Parmesan " and not the original Parmigiano ...with a terrible taste
4
Tried the breakfast at this hotel during my stay, the breakfast selection is not bad, other than the usual spread for intercontinental buffet breakfast, they also serve local dishes and fruits. Remember to try their traditional prawn noodles, although itâ€™s not as fantastic as those from the hawker centre. But the soup base is not bad and the portion is not too big so you can try the other food too
5
Carousel is on the ground floor of the Royal Plaza on Scott's. They have an extensive buffet offered for breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner, of high quality and all you can eat. Prices range from Sing.$ 33-75, depending on time of day and weekday vs weekend. Food choices include salads, fruits, cereals and yogurts, vegetarian Indian curries, omlet station, breads & pastries, dim sum, Chinese noodle station, and a variety of cheeses, sausages, and other meat & shellfish stirfry dishes. The restaurant is completely non-pork. Decorum is lovely, food is excellent, and service is efficient and smiling. A good choice near Scott's and Orchard Blvd

Singaporeans are ultimate foodies and love their high teas, which are usually held in hotel restaurants. High teas can range up to $100, especially at high end hotels. There are two kinds of high teas in Singapore - British scones, dessert & tea style, then a Singaporean type with an international array of foods buffet style. Royal Plaza on Scotts Rd hotel offers the latter at 3:30 pm every day and is affordable. The restaurant is ground level and opens their doors promptly at 3:30 for the high tea, so if you are early, you will have to wait in the lobby. There is such a huge range of foods from seafood, to deep fried chicken wings, pizza, soups, snacks, desserts, etc that you will have a difficult time deciding what to eat. One great feature of the Royal Plaza one is that they have a lot of famous Singaporean specialties so you get to try their local snacks. For example, you might have to ask a local fellow diner how to assemble a famous snack called pietee, which is a little edible cup that you filled with all kinds of savoury fillings before you eat it. Another favourite is ice kacang where they offer an electric ice shaving machine to make yourself a mound of shaved ice on which you pile your favourite toppings. It's great to learn something new about the city that you travel to. Suggest you make reservations for high tea at Royal Scotts but I just showed up and waited for the doors to open

I've been there for breakfast, lunch even dinner with my family. Love the food but the sitting is too cramp. The staff is great. But i wont bring any of my overseas friends over.
4
This is the best place for entertaining your Muslim and non-Muslims friends and associates. The food selection is wide and tasty, as it is very popular, advance booking is advised.
3
A little expensive for non-shell-fish and sashimi eaters like me.Great variety for the 'shell-fish' lovers. Desserts are yummy too.
4
Great food..nice place.a wide choice...nice staff.be prepare to sit with a big crowd.food are fresh..should always book in advance as it always full for walk in.

Last year, i had a lunch birthday party at Carousel. I pre-booked their awesome private rooms which are connecting rooms (double thumbs up), and can hold up to a maximum of 28 pax. However, i feel that 24 pax is already the maximum for the room's seating. Lucky for me, i only had 24 pax and hence i could rent the private rooms for free. The whole atmosphere in the private rooms are super awesome and i totally fell in love with the Chandeliers in the two rooms. The best part is none other than their food! (FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD).Though i didn't get to eat much as i had to attend to my guests, they certainty enjoyed the food. Great seafood and mouth watering desserts to die for. The staffs in Carousel also gave me a surprise birthday song which really touched me :')I did not regret hosting my birthday party at Carousel (though it's really quite pricey). :) Thank you for making my party such a memorable one
5
My wife and a friend had a wonderful dining experience at this buffet style restaurant in SINgapore. The food stations were great and the food was of the highest standard. Found it hard to decide what to eat as there was so much choice on offer.The seafood station has the most enjoyable fresh seafood for a starter. The choice of what to eat next was difficult but I went for a mixture of eastern and western food. One fo the best parts was the desert buffet which was wonderful just to look at.Overall a great dining expereince. Will be going back there in the future
4
I used to have breakfast at this restaurant when i stayed at the Royal Plaza hotel. The spread is almost the same as all 5 star hotels and there are kitchenettes for ordering fresh cooked items. The quality of food is average but nothing to complain. Lunch & dinner are however quite expensive
3
Its a good buffet spread - lots of variety and they do replenish the trays frequently. But because it is in the Sultan of Brunei's hotel, it is also halal ie. Muslims can eat there and so, the place is really bustling since it is one of the few halal buffet places. It sort of gets to you after a while when you are jostled for the umpteenth time. Pretty good value and standard if you can stand the crowds
4
The service staff is great and they are very attentive. There are staff behind the food counter to help cut up the meat for you or to cook pasta for you too. The choices of food is great, especially the seafood counter, I had the crab and crayfish which are fresh. I do not eat shellfish and there are plenty around. The dim sum and drunken prawn is surprisingly good too. I had the lamb rack which was rather chewy for me. Do try the dessert, especially the chocolate fondue and ice cream. There are not many halal restaurant around in Singapore, so this is definitely one of the better halal restaurant around. The only down side to the restaurant is that the seating arrangement are rather tight. I kept moving my chair for the people seated behind me
3
I tried a simple rice with chicken plate, but the chicken was not really hot - actually more cold than hot. The menu is brought by an iPad - no paper anymore. The drinks are ok. We had life music, but it was quite empty. No special place.In general prices are not cheap and there are a couple of better clubs and bars in Singapore. It is good for a last drink before going to bed
5
The spread was one of the best breakfasts i have had in Singapore
2
Just crowded.... Many people come for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Just eat and eat, nothing special about the food, standard quality.
4
Loved the huge spread and variety of food. One of the few halal places for muslims to enjoy a scrumtious buffet. A little expensive but worth the money.
3
purely personal. no biggie. could have spend the cash otherwise. but it would be a good pamper or a good place to show your potential catch how wealthy you are.
5
I love the buffet variety they serve here. It is not too cheapskate like what certain high end hotels serve. I will love to go back again.
1
All the food is made by outside contractors and of a very very average to poor quality. Cold pancakes, very average dim sum, horrid coffee, pastries were the worst I have ever eaten. Over all a dreadful experience, never again!
4
Be careful that you might just over do it at the buffet. I love every counter. Do walk around or you might miss some of the counters tacked away the corners. Make reservations or you could be disappointed especially on Fridays
5
Mango Ravioli, a must-try there. Splendid dinner there.
3
Good variety if you're looking for a halal buffet - go for the high tea for good value for money.
5
The weekend dinner buffet in Carousel is absolutely wonderful. They have lobsters, crayfish, oysters, prawns, shellfish, crabs, salmon. The prawns are particularly sweet and it might be because they have a tank where they keep live prawns.The dessert selection is great too and the ambience is cozy and inviting. Waiters clear your plate quickly and I would say the service is good. This place is one of the few higher end halal food options available on the island.I have been here a few times in the past and noticed that the menu selection changes from time to time and I understand that the weekday menu is somewhat different from the weekend menu. It's a great place to dine with loved ones
5
The best breakfast in my opinion as the variety is amazing. Fresh juice is available but you have to get there fast or they run out of the fruits (they make your juice on the spot). Hot food wise they had everything.
4
Good variety of food. They open each oyster only when you want it. Plenty of choices and they do replenish. Most unique is the buffet is 'halal' !!!
4
Generous offerings and wide selection of seafood. Expensive but also value for money.
5
Marvellous selection of buffet spread.
The service staff was friendly and attentive.
4
Good selection. Great place to entertain if you have friends who need a halal option.
3
The spread of food isn't as impressive as what other reviewers mentioned. I have been to others that offered better range. (e.g the Melt)
The cooked food are average. Not impressive. An average overall.
4
Good Food, Always Crowded. They have won awards fot their buffets. they offer special discounts on some credit cards.
5
Been there twice. Seafood spread is a lot and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. Don't miss this place during your visit to Singapore.
4
I really enjoyed the seafood and selection of local and international food. I heard from the locals it's very difficult to get in without a reservation. The service was great; the servers were very detail-oriented and observed and watched to see what we needed while the party was busily conversing. Dropped napkins or forks were replenished before we even asked for them. Cool
5
If you are searching for a good restaurant on Orchard road,this is truly one of the place...The buffet they served was absolutely tasty and in a very hight quality.Plus,if you a muslim searching for halal restaurant,this is also the place for you.I still craving for the food they served during the breakfast buffet,especially the waffel and pancake topped with maple syrup and the wipped cream.Absolutely delightful...The pastries are also varieties and freshly made.The food here are so variety.I just cant get enough with the food and I also wished I had a bigger stomach.The ambience are also a plus.Would love to come back if I staying in this hotel next time
5
Love Royal Plaza on Scotts, carousel is fantastic never seen anything like it
5
Food is fresh, good range and staffs ushering you to your seats are fantastic!
4
I went there for hi-tea recently.The ambience was good and the food served on the buffet spread were fresh.The chef will make rounds and make sure the food were replenished before it runs out.They have Asian delights like handmade popiah,pietee,rojak,Nasi Lemak,prata and laksa.Deserts like ice kacang is also worth the try
2
We had organised a mini celebration at Carousel 2 weeks ago. The staff were very friendly and fairly prompt although it was very busy. But I am not impressed with the spread of food and quality. No salmon belly for buffet, most buffet do serve it as part of the sashimi spread, like Mandarin, Goodwood, etc, the few I have been to. The satay was dried and rather tasteless. The dessert spread was not too impressive too. The cheese spread was rather good and "exotic", I quite enjoy it infact. I am not sure I will go there again, as it is not really value for money, for the price, $80 per pax after discount. It was a bad location to wait for taxis, as it is not classified under CBD, so no surcharge for taxis..... the waitress although friendly did not inform me of the coupon that I can get to have priority at taxis stand...... had to call one instead....
3
After reading other reviews and also taking into account the location I was expecting quite a lot from this place, I did not get it.There is a fair selection of main dishes but there is only a modest selection of starters and deserts. Some of the main dishes were cold or lukewarm some were empty and not replaced.The restaurant cannot seem to decide what it wants to be and do that well; it feels like a mess and failed to impress me.Service was fast but not very personal, overall a dissPpinting experience
5
It is always a rare pleasure and privilege to stay at the Royal Plaza On Scotts (especially their lovely hotel rooms) and this restaurant is part of the experience. The diversity of choice and the variety of food available caters for every palate and the consumer is absolutely spoilt for choice. Whether it is breakfast, high tea or lunch (haven't tried dinner there yet), it is always of great value. Service is great -for the most part wait staff are attentive, courteous and polite beyond what is required of them and the ambience and the layout of the restaurant is also very nice. Highly recommende

I was celebrating my anniversary wif my husband on 7th april 2011. We were given reservations immediately. At arrival, staff greeted us warmly. Made us feel instantly welcomed!Buffet spread was awesome!We were surprised with a small cake that was complimentary! Assistant manager balan and another male staff wearing black suit was exceptionally fantastic.I will definitely come again! The night has made my anniversary truly memorable and wonderful
4
Good selection of food. The desserts need improvements, should have more selection. Other than these, the ingredients were fresh. The seafood available there had me going back for more. The sushi was excellent. Great value for money. However, the queue was very long. Reservations preferablely should be made beforehand.Best place for buffet in Singapore
5
High tea in CAROUSEL in Royal Plaza on Scots is fantastic and i would say best value buffet in Singapore. Food choice and quality fantastic and service is excellent too.I must confess that I went 3 times for roasted duck! Absolutely amazing, Canâ€™t wait to go back again. My compliments to all people making visiting this place unforgettable experience.thank youAnto
4
existing two lanes to the hotel entrance was closed to only one operating lane. caused major jam not only to the hotel but also to Shaw and DFS building. long Q was caused outside the hotel and along scotts road. but restaurant serves good food with good service
3
no oysters at this price... not too value for $$$
3
tried hi-tea buffet. good variety.
5
One of the best buffer spreads in town with many stations. And halal to boot if you have muslim friends
5
Excellent choice and very nice food, all halal as well.
The staff are very friendly and helpful and the decor is very nice too. We ate an evening meal there and were completely stuffed by the time we left :D
4
One of the better buffets
2
Lousy service! Pastry sucks!
3
For the quality, but not variety.
4
Best for hi-tea ;)
5
THe place is cozy and the food spread is great....Lots of seafood too...The important thing it is halal....I think this is the most cozy halal restaurant I have been to...
Should try it...the buffet price maybe expensive but its worth the money...
5
What's special to me about this restaurant is that their buffet line is halal. The grill section is wonderful and salad choices are plenty. Even though I don't care much about dessert, they also have a pretty wide selection of both local and western choices for sweets
3
dessert a bit suck for a buffet restaurant. The place to bring halah people for business
3
halal buffet is not bad

I've only gone for the High Tea so far.. GREAT spread! So many to choose from - please go on an empty stomach! Haha. So I reckon the spread for dinner would be loads better! Can't wait to try! Hees.
3
Good buffet spread.
3
ok to be fair, i'm giving them 3/5. don't go for the hi tea... dinner spread is visually stunning, tastes even better
