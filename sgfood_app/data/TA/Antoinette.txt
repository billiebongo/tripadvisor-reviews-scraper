Excellent service! Food was good as usual. Went on a quiet afternoon and atmosphere was nice and cosy for a quiet chat
3
Service was good but the all day breakfast of Egg Florentine and pancakes were so so as have eaten better ones at other restaurants in Mandarin Gallery.
5
If a 3 course meal for two warrants a budget of no more than 50 bucks, you wouldn't expect services to that seamless and fantastic. 10/10 for service crew.
3
Felt cheated as the Chope exclusive was actually a tasting menu. Portion was extremely small. Not worth the price paid.
3
Ambience was great, service was fabulous, dessert needless to say, fantastic as usual, however, their food have much need for improvement.
2
It was disappointing as the 1 For 1 Set Meal simply halfed the regular food portion and served 2 people. What promotion is this, not value for money and felt cheated.
5
Food and ambience is still good . Love the cakes esp. A good dining place for the ladies to have brunch

I had shown several dining options to my Korean friend and she chose Antoinette at the Mandarin Gallery due to its proximity to her hotel (and no doubt the rather elegant photos on the cafe/restaurant’s website). Antoinette is supposed to be a French eatery with an Asian twist, but the menu also includes some Italian fare, so it would be more accurate to say it serves European-Asian fusion cuisine. I thought the one-for-one deal sounded promising until I read a few of the reviews - some of the comments were enough to cause me some concern. Afterall, I really wanted both of us to enjoy the dinner. Before we ordered, the staff repeatedly assured us that the food would be sufficient for the value-for-money one-for-one deal. And they were right. Not only were the portions all right, they were delicious! We ordered each of the following and had a good time sharing:Starter: Antoinette’s Mushroom Soup (small bowl of authentic mushroom soup but it was deliciously rich)Starter: Duck Rilette with wild mushrooms and poached eggs (quite good)Main: Omelette with red wine beef ragout and butter pilaf rice (tasty, with all the elements working well together, and surprisingly filling because of the pilaf rice)Main: Chili crab tagliatelle (my friend from Seoul really liked it!) The dessert was the chef’s choice: white chocolate coffee cake. It was yummy, with just the right texture and balance of sweetness. (Afterall, Antoinette is better known for its cakes and desserts, thanks to Singaporean pastry chef Pang Kok Keong). The one-for-one dinner cost SGD50++, just under SGD60 (USD46/£32/¥4,992/48,857 KRW). Très, très bien! That’s really reasonably priced for a three-course dinner for two ladies at the Mandarin Gallery, smack in the middle of Orchard Road! We felt that even though French/European food usually comes very well presented and plated in much smaller portions, the servings we had were fairly generous. Bon appétit
4
Love the ambience and decor of this place. The decor is unlike the minimal styles we get in other cafes in Singapore. It's a refreshing change and the food is great too. A pity I didn't get to try the cakes, will come back for the cakes another time.
5
Went for the 1 for 1 3- course promotion. The chilli crab pasta was surprisingly good, i really feel like I'm enjoying chilli crab. Servings might seems small but find it just nice as we were not very hungry. The service staff were friendly and offered excellent services.Love the chair, so comfy.
3
Had their 3 course set menu. Taste wise is not bad. Nice ambience as well. Quiet which is good for making conversation. Food portion is small though.
3
The creativity of the nesi lemak burger is good. The food consider above average. The only downside is the coffee. Too cold . I ask for a hot latte . Need improve on this .
4
Service was excellent - staff was attentive and efficient. Food was quite nice. Loved the Antoinette salad! Mushroom risotto was a little too heavy and creamy. And aircon was crazy cold, couldn't stay any longer.
4
Ambience is great but service is a little slow. Love the cakes especially the walk in the forest! Cute
3
Food was great, love the Aligo olio! However, the restaurant is abit cramp, prefer the restaurant and atmosphere at penhas road.
5
Good food, good ambience, great service! Definitely recommend to go for their crab pasta and French toast. Expect to pay $50/pax
5
Nasi lemak burger was crazily good. Think otak,cucumber, fried egg, fried chicken patty, sambal and rice all in it! 3 pax with 3 main course, a bottle of wine, 2 teas and 2 desserts and the bill was $150! Totally worthed it!
4
This was our 2nd visit. The first was not auspicious, seated as we were next to two loud obnoxious women who did not bother to keep their conversation to themselves. Manners 101.Anyhow, on this occasion, they seated us in s corner, as requested. We shared the salade Antoinette (crab meat, edamame, quinoa), then companion had the mushroom soup - which came with two crunchy slices of bread. Heavenly. Then came the mains. The chicken roulade was very good, and the boeuf bourgignon (slow braised wagyu), even better. Prices are a bit stuff but you get quality. The servers were friendly and attentive too (although they had to be reminded to refill water glasses). Nevertheless, service was certainly better than in many other establishments.
4
Went to Antoinette's for a celebration. The waiters were attentive to our needs. The restaurant was flexible enough to prepare spaghetti pomodoro - although the latter was not really on the menu . Was a little disappointed with the mushroom soup - it was rather bland. I ordered the ribeye, rare. However was surprised to see that it was less than 1cm thick. This makes for a difficult steak to grill. True enough, the steak was blue in some parts and over cooked in others. There was also an inappropriate level of gristle. All in all, not a good exemplar of a ribeye.
3
It wasnâ€™t my first time been to this restaurant and I always love their food and cakes. My friend and I were sitting near the kitchen and we can hear every single conversation from the kitchen staff. I would advice you to choose a table further away from kitchen.
3
The variety of the food can be improved and the prices of the existing ala-carte menu is a bit too steep. Overall, the dining experience is good.
3
The food is alright but restaurant looks tired. Menu is worn, furniture looks old, and the seating is tight. The place could do with a refresh to bring it back to its best.
5
We really enjoyed the French pastries, which were beautiful to look at, and tasted amazing. Antoinette has the best desserts in town, hands down.
3
Had my birthday tea here, was hoping to be cosy but it was a little too dim for preference, service was ok - friendly servers. The cakes were good!
4
We like the outlet at Mandarin Gallery. Centrally located but away from the crowd.
The Royale Hot Chocolate works surprisingly well as the source for the thick pancakes 🥞
3
Good Service staff but most food is not up to standard. Desserts are ok better than the mains. Ambience :/ looks pretty rundown compared to Lavender Branch.
4
The Roast Duck Breast.was very tasty especially the garnishing was very creative & good too. The decor is also very chic.
5
A fantastic place with great ambiance for get together with friends over a pleasant afternoon tea in the heart of Orchard Road. Restaurant is located in the upper level of Mandarin Gallery. It offers a nice spread of cakes and staff at the counter was friendly. The Le Royale was superbly delicious. Canâ€™t resist and bought the cake
5
The ambience of the place gives you a good initial expectation. Service though is hard to catch as the staff seem to be overwhelmed. Food was generally okay except for the desserts which were excellent. Probably would come here again just for the desserts. Good to look at and good to eat. Yumz
4
After few satisfying visits to Antoinette Penhas Road, It is my first visit to Mandarin Gallery outlet. I find that this sitting arrangement is more congested than Penhas Road, maybe due to the more expensive location in Orchard Road, but the good thing is that the quality of food has been well maintained.
4
Wish the restuarant could be more spacious. Great service staffs. Great cakes and mains! :) great beefs
3
place was a little over rated for the good, based off all the glowing reviews on some food blogs.
ambiance was ok and service was prompt, but the quality of the lunch and good was totally not worth the price paid
5
food is good. ambience is good. price is reasonable. reservation is required. French Toast is highly recommended.
3
Good service but food was not hot.i order steak and was not hot at all if you like hot food not a recommendation .however service was good
2
Not worth the value, the portion is too small, perhaps for kids meal. Taste wise ok. Service could be improve for those having this 1-for-1 set
4
The shrimp pasta and la petite salad were exquisite, though the asparagus was rather fibrous. The shrimp was very fresh and the overall taste was very delicate. I was looking forward to the dessert but it was just ok. I remember enjoying it more at my earlier visit at the Penhas Rd branch
3
Theres a 1- 1 set meal promotion between chope and antoinette but little did i know, the portion is not what im expecting. For the mains, it feel like one normal portion split into 2. I was looking at what other orders and i think most of them ordered the ala carte, their portions was huge so that made me wonder. For a set meal that costs $50++ (put the 1-1 promotion aside), if the portion they served is so pathetic, then i think it would be alot more worth it to just get the ala cart. And the food wasnt super great, but they have nice and friendly waiter which savage alittle. =)
4
Tried their La Rose, Monotone and Orient. Love their Orient where is made up of a coconut sponge base, topped with layers of crunchy salted peanut and sesame feuilletine. Covered with light and creamy white lotus seed mouss with a rich flowy salted egg cremeux in the middle of the cake
2
We went for the 1-for-1 set menu. It cost us $50. If I were to pay $50 for such small portion for a person, it was really a ripe-off. Hence their 1-for-1 promotion is not sincere at all. Also, the decor and chairs were rather dated, time to have a makeover
2
1) The food - IT HAD A FLY THAT LANDED ON THE SALAD, ON THE EGGS, ON THE SMOKED DUCK. I have a hunch that the staff only changed the salad. 2) The staff were not attentive. I ordered a pot of tea, it did not arrive even after the end of my meal. I requested the staff to lower the volume of the eerie muffled jazz music playing on repeat, I bet he forgot about that request too.3) Twice beaten is adequate enough for me not to dine here again.
3
Foods wise was overrated and overpriced. Ordered 2 sets of all day breakfast, both with poached eggs, no sauce for the eggs and the sad thing about the eggs was that there's totally no yolk taste at all. Pretty much disappointed with that.
4
Review by Dr Sim. Very good cakes. Usually I do not eat cakes but the cakes were very good. Service is good. High end cake and cafe. Outlet is on Orchard Road. Air-conditioned. Tourists should try. Not cheap. Regards DrSim001
4
Order the 1 for 1 set meal, very small portion, have to order additional from alacarte menu but food is good. The dessert is very good too. Service can be improved.
5
I love to visit them again... thank you for the service.. Glad that my gf is happy coz is for her birthday celebration!!!
1
The portion is just big enough to feed a bird. One of the 2 main courses is not available and no alternative was offered. Tt left diners with no choice at all.
2
Food portion is too small for one for one menu. Pasta does not taste that good. Like decor setting in restaurant. Location at Orchard is convenient.
4
The service was very good, very attentive. The kale caesar was special and good. The best was dessert, chocolate cake. The chocolate was rich and not too sweet. Will visit again!
5
I am very impressed on the restaurant. Very cozy and great ambience. The cakes are really pretty however i dont think it taste great. Service is ok only.
1
There was this 1-for-1 promo and the restaurant says it cost $50 per diner for the set meal So with the promo I pay on $50++. Sounds like a fair deal. Well it was not. The portions given to us were very small. And certainly not enough for a dinner. We left the restaurant disappointed and felt tricked by the deceptive promo. Will be more weary now for such gimmicks. As for the food, there was no typical French dishes at all. Just western meal. I had chilli crab tagliatelle. Sounds more Italian. I cam only says the service was all right.
3
The food was great, except the chilli crab pasta smell and taste a little weird, like too much soy sauce. The salad and soup portions was too small; felt like eating kids meal.... My friend's chicken roulade. After the meal, we were only 50%.full. is that the purpose since the set we ordered were 1 for 1? Actually the biggest issue is we wonder how they compute the UP of $50 when the portion, as we were told by the waitress, was a reduced one compared to a LA carte portions. Which means if we had paid $50, we still get the same mini portion? Otherwise, how can it be called a promotion? U might as well label it as sampler so we know we are paying less for equitable food. Don't take customers for fools, cos they may not return. The quality don't disappoint. The mushroom soup is the best I had.
1
recently went for the 1 for 1 promotions at antoinette but I was served a "promotional" size menu, which was barely half the size of the normal meal. Please state carefully in your promotion as half for half instead of 1 for 1.
4
very classy place for a nice meal. food is good too love the french toast! many visits here and will come back again
4
Staff were friendly and ambience was nice. Quiet and comfortable place. Food looks good and taste good too. A Will definitely visit again.
3
We love the cafe at Piazza but this one is definitely not as good. The whole place looks run down and the aircon is too cold. Food is only passable.
5
The decor was so beautiful and it made us feel like royalty! Food was also yummy and plated well. Would love to go back!
5
My first visit to Mandarin outlet. Definitely my hunt out next time. Idea for privacy, spacious, good theme and music.
4
The food overall was not bad, but abit overpriced.
Cake looks nice and taste nice too.
Environment looks authentic but abit noisy once it is full house.
Services abit slow.
4
Really nice food and the service was excellent. Something's need updating in the restaurant but otherwise wonderful

I had the smoked duck breast with egg and wow am I amazed at how terrible the food was. The duck breast looked and tasted like the pre-cooked frozen ones from ntuc, except you get about 5 slices of meat. You also get about 5 pieces of sliced mushrooms, some pieces of salad leaves and croutons. That's it. Oh and 2 eggs which you must add $3 for. The eggs were way too watery and undercooked (and the eggs looked like they poached them by tying them in plastic bags and dropping them in hot water). Honestly, I could have done a better job cooking this dish myself. But I suppose I have only myself to blame since that's technically all the ingredients listed on the menu. The cakes look better than they taste, unless you're a fan of milk chocolate. I got the Royale which was supposed to be dark chocolate but honestly tastes more like milk chocolate.Service really depends on which waitress you get. Our first waitress (middle-aged Malay lady) black faced us throughout the entire meal, smiling only when she chased us to leave before the dinner crowds come in. Oh yeah and I had a dirty knife at the start (before I ordered) which I asked her to change for me, and amazingly, she walked out of sight and after a while came back with the exact same knife!!?? I had to point out to her the unwashed piece of food on the knife from the last guest that used it before she actually changed it for me, and that took her about 10min AFTER my food came. She also forgot our order 3 times (how did that even happen) but that's the least of her flaws.That aside, I'm giving this one more star than what I thought it deserved because funnily enough, the restaurant gave me one more egg for my meal because apparently they forgot one egg (there's supposed to be 2 eggs in the dish but they gave me only one). So kudos to them for their honesty
3
The place was relatively empty for a weekday night. The selection of cakes on the display were rather limited. 2 of the cakes which I was planning to have were not available.Yuzu Green Tea Bubble Bath ($12++)Jasmine green tea with yuzu, dill, mango and lime meringueThe drink was part of the Dilmah Tea Inspired Menu from 1 June to 31 July. It was served with a rubber yellow duck sitting on the meringue. So cute looking. The drink was refreshing with cubes of mango sitting in the bottom. Interestingly it was not served with a spoon and had to request for one.French Toast with Ham and Cheese ($14++)Served with creme chantillyBrioche bread sandwiched with Swiss Gruyere cheese cream, Paris ham served with salad tossed in house dressing.Could not taste the cheese cream in the bread, nor could see it. The bread looked average not the kind of brioche bread which I was expecting.Ondeh Ondeh Queen's Castella Cake ($11+)Made using fresh fragrant pandan leaf, and studded with gula melaka bits with hints of coconut.It was like pandan chiffon cake, with filling in between
5
The food is delicious
The pasta pomodoro is great, the crepes with chicken is great, the best are the cakes... we had antoinette and charlote IV and both of them are superb...
The atmosphere is great
The waiters are a bit difficult to be called
3
nothing much except the fancy cakes, average taste, bit pricy. go there just only for cake presentation. so and so ambience, nothing special for all.
3
the cakes looks very nice with good presentation. They look delicious too with interesting flavor but maybe a bit too sweet ?Service and environment is good too. Good for high tea afternoon with friends for long chat as the place is quiet.
5
I don't visit it often but when I do, they always have something new. The croissants are their specialty and are always crispy and yummy. I have tried several other desserts as well, some are according to seasons, e.g. Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day.
5
Everything was amazing: incredible service, food and atmosphere 😍😍😍 probably my favourite place to eat in Singapore.
3
We ordered the wild mushroom risottos and the stuffed chicken leg for sharing. Keeping our stomach for desserts. The risottos was nice.For cakes, I liked the Antoinette most. Its milk chocolate mousse infused with earl grey tea. The mixture of tea with chocolate was just right
3
Had dinner here and got the promo dinner set thinking we had a good deal. We were wrong. The deal came with a starter, main and dessert. While the starter was decent, the main and dessert were basically smaller portions of the same dish on the ala-carte menu. It was especially obvious as the cakes were all of standard size and ours was basically cut in half. Quality of the food was really mediocre....Suggestion to the management... make sure to specify if the promo portions are smaller.Will probably go back for the cakes but for sure not the food.
4
What I knew of this place is their salted egg croissant. Decided to go for a try and relize they offered much more greater choice of food with great quality as well. Not to mention their salted egg croissant which is worth dying for. We ordered the chilli crab croissant which is equally fantastic. However the matcha croissant is not our favorite. Taste kinda weird to us. But their dessert is just lovely and my kid really love it.Do give it a try
5
 im here at the moment with le wife for Valentine's Day tea break. i ordered the humble yet simple French Toast with Maple Syrup, my God it was gigantic!! 3 large french toast bathed in not-too-sweet maple syrup..it was absolutely amazing. and also i ordered the Ice Yuzu drink, delish!! go on the weekday, less patrons, no queue. for some it might be a little pricey,but totally worth it. wont come here too often though, unless u wanna gain weight quickly!!! must try...!!
4
I needed a few desserts for a party and stopped here to pick some up. The cakes are all so pretty I knew at least they would look great. Well, they not only looked great but they tasted delicious and were light and fresh. Everyone enjoyed them. The person who helped me select the cakes was very kind and helpful in recommending what to choose. I appreciated they taped down each cake in the box so they would not move around when I was commuting to the party. The cakes are on the pricey side but make quite an impression with their presentation.
4
If you are looking for a sweet tooth fix then this is the place to get it! The cakes are yum!
We had dinner and was at best average and sometime served like warm...
Definitely return to pick up cake and delicious sweets.
4
Happened to walk past and saw the most amazing cakes...had to have the Terrarium Petit...was good, not amazing but good ...$20. Friend had the strawberry shortcake (pictured) which was really yummy and only $9.
5
Very exquisite place for dessert, hidden away inside a shopping gallery. No doubt you pay the high price for the food. Definitely worth another visit.
2
Our family had lunch here. The beef entrecÃ´te was overcooked and full of gristle. My pasta arrived before my foie gras appetizer. The foie gras was bland. We had to follow up our orders several times before they finally served it. At the prices they charge I expected better service and food quality
2
We visited Antoinette with my girlfriend based on recommendations we had from friends and her previous visit. However, we were greeted with a note that we have to spend minimum $20 or we can stay only less than 30 minutes. The restaurant had 3 tables occupied only at this time and after we left (50 minutes later) there we tables occupied only. We ordered 2 types of hot chocolate and 2 crepes. Chocolates were very nice and met with our expectations. However, the crepes were too sweet, over-fried and tasteless. The interior is a bit rundown with scratches and stains on the tables and seats
5
Love their Marronette. The cake is soft with lots of crunchy bits on top! But I still give Mont Blanc my highest rating. It is definitely for chestnut fan.The place can get a wee bit noisy. Fair enough, as the area is small and thus fairly small space in between tables.Yes, I do hope to visit this place again for other cakes and definitely must have the Mont Blanc again
4
Visited the cafe for coffee and cakes, Nice ambience for relaxing and chatting on a lazy afternoon. We had their Le Royal and. Strawberry shortcake , both quality cakes come with delicate and rich flavors. Coffee was great , together with the cozy atmosphere, it's a nice place to chill
4
We have a wonderful time visit in Antoinette Cafe at Mandarin Gallery in 2014. The dessert was nice and staff was friendly, but Long Q .. especially on weekends. We like the Strawberry cake & Montblanc cake with Black Tea & Coffee . We like the dessert but due to Long waiting we never been there anymore..
4
This is our go-to patisserie for birthdays, Christmas celebrations etc as the cakes are delectably presented, light on the palette with its quality ingredients YET on the reasonable end of the luxe range. I've followed Chef Pang through his exploits from Canele under Les Amis to Pique Nique and now celebrate his own French brand. We had 2 birthdays this weekend and adored the pink Superlova (rose mousse and raspberry) and the intriguing Terranium (all forms of dark chocolate and alcohol delights). The standout was the Trufflette from the Fetish Chocolat range crafted to look exactly like that ambrosial earthy fungi. Two thumbs up. Till next time.
4
We were here to try their famous salted-egg yolk croissant for takeaway. Service was good, price was reasonable, and the place was nice. As for the croissant itself, I like it a lot, since the filling was not as sweet as other salted-egg yolk croissant from other bakery that I've tried before. It was just right. Located on the 2nd floor of Mandarin Gallery at Orchard Road, this place was easy to find
5
We had coffees and pancake here. I had coffee latte and tasted yeah was not bad, but the pancake was really really good! And the interior of this cafe was awesome too!
4
Stopped in for an afternoon dessert pick-me-up. Place is small but very cute inside. Dessert case was filled with several different selections. Enjoyed a piece of strawberry cake. Very light and refreshing on a hot day. Price was affordable. Service was great.
4
Grand ambience with many artistic wall pictures, fanciful mirrors and lights. The quaint and comfy furniture are at the expense of walking space between tables.The place is famous for cakes. The popular one is called "Antoinette" named after the cafe which is the name of last queen in France. This chocolate cake is infused with earl grey and is recommended to those chocolate lovers who enjoy some twists.The cafe is continually experimenting with new creations. One of them is queen tart made from many types of cheese and will be greatly appreciated by cheese lovers.Another new signature for limited period is croissant with salted yolk lava. The taste and texture are awesome. There is another version of lava croissant adapted to local laksa flavour. Unfortunately with the one we ordered, the lava did not flow out smoothly from the croissant as expected. The waitress was kind enough to replace with a new croissant. We have indeed received excellent service, thanks to waitress by the name of Jen
3
Quaint little French place in the Orchard road mall. They have an extensive breakfast, tea and dessert menu, but a limited entree and main dish menu. Although, the prices are OK. I had the ribeye with mashed potatoes and greens. While the taste was OK, it was a tough cut of beef. I did have the chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream...very good
3
My favorite brand for macaron here was Canelé which under the same management company "Les Amis" which closed down. So, I was expecting to get the same taste and quality of macaron from this place. I was very disappointed with the runny cheap cream they using. They didn't use real ganache in it. I ate after purchase less than 10 mins and it was messy. The shells quality as good as Canelé Pâtisserie level. Price rank here are from 2.50-2.80$ plus tax. Go to TWG Tea Salon for 2$ nett per macaron with real ganache. TWG's macaron shells is a bit softer than this brand.. No mess when eat though.
3
The cafe was located at the second level of the shopping mall. At the front of the cafe, I was attracted by its offering of delicious looking cakes and pastries. Inside the cafe, it was decorated in a very English style with grand armchairs and comfy sofas. Quatre Fromages croissant ($6++)classic croissant with a well-rounded mix of aged Cheddar, Gruyère, Parmesan and MozzarellaThe cheesy filling flowed out easily like lava. The pastry was light and crispy. There was also other flavours such as Matcha, Charcoal Kaya, Chilli Crab, Salted Caramel, and Salted Egg.Vanilla Cheese Tart ($2.60++)I was surprised when the filling flowed out like lava too when I cut it into halves. Too bad the salted egg yolk was not available. The only other flavour available was chocolate which I was not interested.Royale Hot Chocolate ($7.50++)Spiced with cinnamon, orange, star anise, cloves and vanillaThe hot chocolate was very thick and rich, although I could not taste the orange and vanilla in it.The bill was served in a jewellery box. So grand looking. After paying the bill, the receipt was clipped with a bookmark. So interesting. The staffs' knowledge of items available was lacking. One staff did not know there was croissant on menu, while another did not know what flavours of the cheese tart.The place was packed and waiting time was about 45 minutes when I overheard a staff telling a customer as I was leaving the place. I was lucky that didn't have to wait for a table then
4
Having heard positive reviews about its cakes i finally went to try. Antionette was good but the earl grey taste was not refreshing enough. Mont blanc was disappointing as it doesnt have the chestnut taste! Felt like i was eating yam puree. Pastrt base was also too hard. Royale was the best despite it being too sweet.Forest berry tea was excellent! It would be good if they had a sweets men
1
The tea cup was dirty. I ordered rose tea and was asked by server if I would like milk with it! The macaroon was crunchy , and chewing gum like in the mouth; not soft and melt in your mouth. The macaroon filling texture was similar to watery yogurt and tasteless. The Mont Blanc did not have a chestnut in the middle
5
This was actually my third visit , first visit was a dine-in, second was takeaway cakes and this time, takeaway cakes too.The shop was well staffed and each one has his/her special role, and chatted for 15 min with a middle aged man even if he bought only 6 macaroons for his teenage girlfriend, while the other staff was pouring iced water and the other girl was using her iPhone to ? Arrange online orders (I suppose so).I didn't have much to say to the guy responsible for takeaway cakes , so he only spent 3 min with me.The cake was lovely although it was chipped a little as the cakes were stuck to the box at different levels 
1
I went there with my girlfriend for high tea. when we reached there, the queue was very long so I guess the food must be good. While waiting, we looked in and noticed the service staff has totally no sense of urgency as they were taking their own sweet time clearing tables and serving customers. we waited for an hour before we finally got our table.We ordered 2 cakes, the Antoinette and Summer and a pot of forest berries. The Antoinette was good but we are quite disappointed with the Summer as it doesn't taste as good as it look.When we were served our tea, it came with the pot of tea and just 1 tea cup. Before I could ask for another tea cup, the service staff informed us that sharing is not allowed. I presume he was saying 1 pot of tea is strictly for 1 person?! We were shocked. It doesn't make sense because obviously we are sharing the pot of tea. Therefore, I asked for another tea cup. We looked around and noticed some tables which also ordered pot of tea were served with 1 tea cup as well. some of them like us, asked for another tea cup while some follow their "rule". I find this "rule" ridiculous as never in my life I was told a pot of tea can only serve 1 person. if this is their policy then it is time to change it
1
ケーキはおいしいかもしれませんが、店員の態度が悪いの一言です。店内で食べたいと思い並んでいたのに、通りかかる店員全員に見て見ぬふりをされ、相当な時間、完全に放置されました。席が空いてないならその一言を言うべきだと思います。海外では日本のようなサービスを受けられないのは普通ですが、それにしてもと思いましたので、評価１をつけさせていただきます。This restaurant is awful even though the desserts taste good, since the staff just left us (and other waiting customers) without saying anything while we were waiting in front of the restaurant for a very long time. I understand that, as a general opinion, the service level of the restaurants overseas is not as good as those in Japan. However, this restaurant is far beyond our expectations and totally disappointing
4
This joint has uncommon hours. When we've tried to come around 8 -9 pm for dinner, they are only serving dessert. So we decided to come for lunch- we were the only guests.The steaks were fine, one of the salads was fine. French Onion soup was very good.The Bombe Alaska was well, unusual and alright.Service was appalling considering we were the only customers. The staff congregated at the cake counter/cashier outside, totally inattentive to us and I had to walk out to the counter to get service, which was also very slow! They did not seem to know the progression of courses for meals or to ask when they could serve the different courses. Young untrained staff?When a restaurant has good location and good food it has potential.We used to enjoy the outlet at Palais Renaissance but will not be rushing back here
4
Le Royale (the flagship cake far more superior over the signature Antoinette cake) is the only reason why I queued for a table here for half an hour on this Saturday afternoon. It never fails to jolt me to heaven each time its well balanced chocolate and feuilletine arouse my taste buds. However, Desir (desired by my lover), promptly plunges me back to earth. The anaemic chestnut cream is overpowered by the acidic blackcurrant jelly. Leaves much to be desired. Perhaps replacing the jelly with a coffee ingredient would offer a chance at redemption
3
My gf brought me here for breakfast to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday. must called and make reservation otherwise you will need to queue. The food is fine, probably nothing special to me. The place was well decorated and the ambiance was quite good for us to to have small talk
5
Me and my friend's most favourite French restaurant. Better than Angelina or Bistro Du Vin. The food selection is much greater, both sweet and savory. The prices are mid-range, yet very worth it for the high quality of the food served. We feel much more worth it compared to other mid-range restaurants. It serves the best French Onion soup in my opinion. And the best of the best French toast. No other French toast that I've tasted in my life comes close to it. Thick slices of bread, thoroughly soaked through with flavour, yet remains so deliciously crispy and fragrant on the outside. No sogginess, no oiliness. Utterly perfect!! Ask for the French toast to be served plain, toppings if any to be served separately, in order to preserve the wonderful crispiness

Had seen this place online and wanted to try it out. The decor was charming but the dessert I ordered was extremely disappointing. The baked Alaska was nothing like what I imagined. The meringue just tasted sickly sweet and I couldn't eat it so I only ate the ice cream inside. For $25 I felt it was grossly overpriced and very unappetising. I wouldn't recommend ordering it but rather sticking to something more basic

Visited Antoinette on a weekday with a friend. Antoinette is situated in Mandarin Gallery. Mandarin Gallery has few cafes. What really draw us to Antoinette was the variety of hand crafted piece of art desserts.We came during high tea. The cafe was elegant and well decorated. Ambience was quite good too. Staffs were friendly. They suggested some of their best-selling desserts and teas.However, my friend and I were interested of their beautifully hand crafted cakes.We ordered:-Summer Petit: Raspberry mousse with pistachio bavarois, forrest berries jelly; pistachio sponge and glaze-Mont Blanc (Mont-Blanc Aux Marrons): a dessert of puréed, sweetened chestnuts topped with whipped cream (My fav, as the sweetness is just nice- very light compared to other Mont Blanc)-Rose Chinois Tea (a must try)-Iced Elder Flower Strawberry Tea (Refreshingly good)Antoinette's french desserts and organic teas were amazing! Their hand crafted desserts and cakes were definitely an Instagram worthy, gorgeously appealing with an exquisite taste

On my recent visit to Singapore, I came across Antoinette, a French café in the heart of the city, and decided to indulge myself! This cafe is run by a local renowned chef, three times over the Pastry Chef of the Year in the World Gourmet Summit. It took me straight back to this café whenever I was in Singapore. From the delicious hot chocolate, wide selection of teas to the decadent world-class pastries. It was a great experience and would happily recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore! Oh and if you are planning for a visit then you must try their signature cake - Antoinette, it’s to die for

Walking past this place without being tempted is shockingly difficult. The items in the window are like miniature works of perfection, and look so delicious. We ordered some patisserie items takeaway, and --- I’ll be honest --- were a little disappointed. They were pretty good, but just not as amazing as we were hoping
5
This review is one month late but it goes to show how impressed I was, to want to commend Antoinette for making their staff feel happy and proud of what they are doing. We were a party of 3 and we could feel that our server, and his colleagues were genuine about wanting to provide a high level of service. We were offered scarves in case the air-conditioning. The food recommendation was great & our server, I forgot his name, was very attentive and sweet
5
Tea and cake really nice and Earl Grey Tea is the best that I've ever taste. And the cafe cozy and really nice for chit chat
4
Go to Antoinette for the delicious cake! The service is average (forgot to bill us half our food). The decor is interesting - my chair had its foam exposed! Nevertheless I would still rate this a 4.
3
This is what happen these days. you decorate your cafe with so many cute props and beautiful things but you don't pay attention to your food. Antoinette is just average. They should pay more attention to the macaroons than the wallpaper.
4
I'm always on the hunt for macarons, but if you're in Singapore stick with Laduree. These have good flavor but the consistency is too mushy.
3
Nice ambiance, good service, buttery heavy cakes and terrible, burnt, sour cappuccino, that is how I would put it shortly.I ordered Antoinette cake. It was good but I could barely finish it, I found it too heavy and buttery. My hubby had Mont Blanc cake. He was not impressed. Especially his cappuccino was terrible, so our feelings about Antoinette were very mixed.Definitely not going back anytime soon, if ever

OMG, deliciously sinful afternoon tea is probably not the best way to go if you’re on a diet. Looking at the food, the desserts, the creamy incredibly thick, incredibly sinful hot chocolate and the sweet spreads would make you throw your diet routine out the window.There was plenty of couples on dates, girlfriends on day out enjoying such decadence on a Saturday afternoon that the wait could be very long. I waited 30 minutes for a table but with this delight staring in your face, what the heck.Enjoy responsibly
4
Very elegant setting so the ambience is grand. Have these wide high back palace like chairs and round tables. Perfect sitting for two and weird for four as they put two round tables next to each other. Menu was grand. But it's a real struggle for vegetarians. Many option has something porky in it or alcohol. Managed to enjoy the crepe instead with small adjustment to the ingredients. My guests says they don't like to deviate from their menu so I chose the crepe as its just fillings to change. The crepe was large and delicious. The other order was gnocchi which was great too. So good wise this place is great and price wise I think it's worth it considering the venue you at. Service can be improved for such a high priced venue. The server will follow the procedural etiquette which is entertaining. But unfortunately this occasion one plate of food arrived 10mins before the other. It was returned as it got cold waiting. It was the gnocchi. Then few minutes later the other dish arrives. Then more minutes later. So food timing from the kitchen is weird and must be improved.Overall the food was elegantly enjoyed but service not so good. Ambience and location is top so final rating is 4.

We went for cake (Chloe), Jasmine tea and hot chocolate. Quite pricey (bill was SGD30) Cake was average, hot chocolate was good, very rich! It was a Saturday dinner time, so it was quite empty. But not many choices of cakes left.What we love most was the ambience, the nice chinaware and the comfortable seats
4
Quaint cosy café that just beckons you in. Comfortable cushioned seats to sink into as you await your order.We sipped on French apple tart tea then delighted in the artistic presentation of our nougatine sweet crepe and the chocolicieux crepes. Light almost crispy sweet crepes that came covered with sauces and served with ice cream.Definitely a lovely afternoon delight

As mentioned, Antoinette's has remained one of my favorite restaurants cum tea rooms at all times, for their pretty desserts, queenly interior decor and delicious savoury food items as well. Hence, we are back for another evening of lovely pastries Anyway, so we had different cakes and desserts for sharing, starting with the Strawberry Coolie with Vanilla Mousse (around SGD$9.00). It had a lovely texture on the outside, like a crusty chiffon kind of combination. The sweet-sour flavor of the fruits blended right in, bringing the pastry to a new height -it tasted as good as it looks. Next, the famous Strawberry Shortcake (around SGD$9.00) - velvety smooth and cotton soft, with the most aromatic strawberry flavor in its cream-dream layers. There were also real fruits tucked between the layers, making this cake an enjoyment in texture and flavor. Finally, the Le Royale cake (SGD$8.00) - layers of dark chocolate mousse, crunchy hazelnut feutille and almond meringue - on a pulp soft sponge cake. This was a chocolate heaven from first bite till the last- the overt sweetness of the chocolate balanced with the other abovenamed ingredients, making it absolutely another favorite of ours.For full review, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/333a-orchard-road-02-33-mandarin.htm

I only just left this bakery about ten minutes ago after buying some macaroons. They are incredible; they've brought me a great deal of happiness that I never knew I could get from baked goods
4
The dessert on the menu, namely the sweet crepes, are absolutely wonderful! The desserts to go from the counter are also very good.
The place is really very cold though, so bring warm clothing
4
Love the presentation of all their desserts. Could see lots of effort put into the preparation. A little pricey for a bite of dessert but overall a great experience that everyone should try at least once.

I popped in to Antoinette while shopping in the lovely Mandarin Gallery Mall in Orchard Road while on holiday in Singapore recently. I was attracted by the beautiful looking cakes in their display. Service was very good. I am not sure what other reviewers were talking about in critiquing the dÃ©cor harshly. I thought it was beautifully done, very luxurious and French themed. Perhaps they were in a different Antoinette (there are a few around Singapore) and mistakenly reviewed it under the wrong one? I was shown to a beautiful armchair - absolutely terrific comfort. I was offered high tea at a cost of $30 which is very reasonable by Australian prices. However, I just wanted one piece of cake so had a strawberry sponge and a hot chocolate (see pictures). In Singapore they don't seem to offer a choice of HC - milk or dark or flavours. The Hot chocolate I received was dark and not very sweet but it was very strong and good quality, so thick it was almost like drinking melted chocolate! Served in beautiful china too. The cake was very good. Very light and moist sponge, very fresh cream and strawberries, freshly made. Cost was about $18 SGD if I recall correctly, so about $15 AUD including taxes (everything is taxed there). They do not serve lunch after 3pm but I only wanted tea anyway. I would definitely return to Antoinette and recommend it as a beautiful place for tea and cake

Second time we have been to Antoinette, first time was diner at the Lavender location, it was a very nice meal I recall. Breakfast was not of a high standard. Pastries lacked the fresh crispness of the real thing, they tasted like they came from long life packaging. Bacon and Sausage both poor quality raw material, sliced toast way to thick and soggy, the poached eggs are acceptable.The black coffee was good, the hot chocolate which is French style was acceptable but perhaps a little bitter for most peoples taste. Menus are well worn, the restaurant is going for the rustic look but items such as the tray the change came in was grubby and the silver coating is worn down to the plastic. The Staff seemed nice enough. I suspect the outlet is either coming towards the end of a lease that the owner does not intend to renew or there is a general lack of management control.Coffee 4Hot Chocolate 3Orange drink 2Antoinette Breakfast 2Nougatine Crepe

For full review and photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/05/all-day-breakfast-at-antoinette.htmlI like the romantic ambience at Mandarin Gallery outlet but the tables here are super small.. Once our food and drinks are all served, there're no more space for you to put anything else, including your hands.. So do not order so much food at one time.. The seatings are quite cramped as well. Aircon also very cold here..... Service was average - We asked for ice water but it was not served... What a waste of this nice place..... Luckily the quality of the food and coffee here are really very good

My wife and I love the desserts from Antoinette! The artisan pastries like Angelique, Antoinette Chocolicieux and Mount Blanc are amazing. The flavours are properly matched and each piece is well designed... a bit pricey but worth the money for the quality of the desserts. Highly recommend if you have the budget and would always bring my overseas friends here for a high tea!To Antoinette, I say "shut up and take my money" :

Dropped by for lunch and was pleased to see the colourful cafe from the floors above, but was truly disappointed when I entered the place. All those beautiful plants, trees and flowers all around were plastic. Not one fresh flower anywhere. This is singapore and you can get fresh flowers from all over the world at your door step. Anyways, I ordered the Crepe brittany (with scallops, shrimps, mussels and all) and what I get is a plain tasting crepe with a pot full of the sea food in wine sauce. There is fine sand in the sea food. Is that a french thing or what? There is no warmth in service. There is a nice display of cakes and Macaroons. Suggest you drop in here for nothing more then a tea and cakes

The lovely Antoinette's Tea Lounge / Restaurant. Believe it or not, I have been to all three outlets - Mandarin Gallery, Palais Renaissance, and Lavendar. I have eaten there five times, and will definitely go back again, for more, perhaps try their outlet at Scarlet Hotel this time.Selection of awesome cakes and macarons, all delectable and fulfilling. My personal favorites are the Chocolate Earl Gray Cake (a deeply-chocolately haven mightily-infused with the richness of earl gray flavor, topped with a cherry that looks and tastes good) and Saint Honore L'amour(crusty pastry filled with the sweet goodness of rose petal cream, rose petal adornment, fresh raspberries and strawberry compote). Sadly, the latter, which is a real beauty - has been taken off the shelves.The Wild Mushroom Risotto - exotic field mushrooms cooked with arborio rice in White Wine cream sauce, served with crispy Serrano ham. The arborio rice has always been one of my favorites as well - chewy in itself, infused with the tasty wine-creamery, made more delicious with mushrooms - heavenly!For more detailed information and photos, visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-antoinettes.htm

My boyfriend and I found this place by accident when we browsed around looking for place to have brunch and we stumbled across this French bistro. I ordered the Antoinette breakfast which has all you need for good, fulfilling yet somewhat light breakfast (coffee/tea/juice is included) and it was really yummy. Boyfriend thought it kinda reminded him of English Pub (which I think it's not, but maybe because he's missing UK so much). I love the place, it's quiet and romantic. Perfect for weekend breakfast with your significant other or your girlfriends.

VeWe came here after visiting the outlet at Scarlet hotel. Very enjoyable and quiet ambience for coffee , hot chocolate and macarons. The staff are very attentive and good. Will definitely return during Christmas
4
you have to try their yuzu crab sandwiches! i found them delightfully refreshing and unusual, and the taste of crab was strong (none of that fake crabstick nonsense). their crepes are also generously-sized, and the noisette one was fantastic.
4
My friend took me out to tea at Antoinette at the Palais Renaissance when she came back to SG. We had macaroons, hot chocolate with Chantilly cream, the Saint Honore l'Amour and the Concorde crepe because we were hungrier than we thought. The crepe (with its own gravy boat of mushroom sauce--delightful), the beverages and macaroons were good, but the rose flavoured Saint Honore tasted like bandung to my Singaporean taste buds. Service was okay but it was difficult to get the waiter's attention sometimes. The decor goes a ways towards the whole "tea with the queen" vibe that is more for ladies doing tea or brunch. Will come back to try the other cakes in the future

I decided to give Antoinette a try after reading the other reviews. I remembered that this place got a lot of buzz since they opened a couple of years ago.I decided to bring my brother at their Mandarin outlet and were not disappointed at all when I step into the restaurant. Their beautiful cakes counter at the entrance and the luxurious furniture created a wonderful ambiance. Furthermore the place is cosy enough to make you feel isolated from the city crowd.We ordered two mains and two desserts.I choose The Gnocchi Carbonara ($18.50) which was a rich dish. With assortment of caramelized bacon and chunky Gnocchiâ€™s served in a white wine cream sauce topped with poached egg and Parmesan cheese, this dish is simply to die for. The Gnocchi which were lightly pan-fried, giving a crisp outer layer and soft center.My brother had the the Classic Eggs Florentine ($14) which was served on toasted brioche with Serrano ham and Hollandaise sauce. He loved the dish, most especially the runny yolk. The dish was appetizing to look at and taste fabulous. For dessert we ordered the signature Antoinette cake and the Strawberry shortcake.My brother became a fan of the Strawberry Shortcake. He said the sponge is light and moist and the use of strawberries was very generous.The Antoinette was a layered cake of earl grey tea with milk chocolate mousse on earl grey tea crumble. A raspberry coulis is perched ontop of the cake and balances the taste, it was a piece of heaven.Overall, we like Antoinette at Mandarin Gallery : dishes fared well, staff looked happy and were very attentive. I will definitely come back for hi-tea as the place would be perfect for an afternoon retreat

Seriously? French food??? OK - the Onion Soup is good, flavourful but a little less bread and more soup would be nice. Tasty touch with the cheese crust. The mixed green salad was nothing special - no flavour to the vinaigrette - needs work. Now - the Service - it was awful - terrible. Please train your staff to be competent and have pride in what they are serving and not even be afraid to recommend items. Sit them down and let them try the food they are presenting to your patrons - sheesh - show them how it should be served. A server started to take our order and when he could not cope, walked away without explanation and a lady came over to "start over"...Come On...either you're in the restaurant business and are serious about it or "throw in the towel". The Coffee - This is supposed to be a French Restaurant - the coffee should be robust, flavourful and strong...and served with fresh pasteurized milk NOT UHT MILK. What's up with that? Couldn't be bothered to order or taste the pretty desserts which look like they are made somewhere else and brought in

As a general rule I can find something positive to say about every dining experience in Singapore, ANTOINETTE is the exception. A recent visit to this eatery was a true disappointment. Our meal began with luke warm cups of watered down "hot" chocolate that resembled the real thing in color only. Further, while our orders--French Onion soup, Nordic Crepe with Smoked salmon, and French Toast-- arrived promptly, we quickly wished they had not come at all. The French Onion soup, with strange cheese hat and vinegary broth, could not have tasted worse had it come from a can. Three spoons was more then enough of this soggy bread ladened mess. The Nordic crepe, which we returned to kitchen after one bite, contained salmon which tasted as though it had gone off earlier in the week. The crepe was as crispy as a taco shell, and bore no similarity to a real crepe. Interestingly, the staff charged us full price, over our objections, for this item because we had tasted it, as if there was some other way to know that it was bad. The French Toast, while eatable at least, was only passable. Needless to say, we left our food largely untouched, and went in search of good food elsewhere. Luckily, in Singapore you don't have to go far. Bottom line: Whether you are looking for French food or just food in general ANTOINETTE is NOT the place to go

The crepes were delicious. I ordered the strawberry crepe (served with Chantilly cream - the best), and my friend had the salted caramel French toast. When I tasted her French toast, I immediately regretted the already delicious crepe. The salted caramel made the French toast murderously good and was so very indulgent. If you're looking to treat yourself after a long week, then I suggest coming to Antoinette. I typically pay a visit to Antoinette whenever I have a horrible craving for macarons. I especially love the passion fruit flavour. However, I suggest either going very early during the weekends like at 10am, or at an odder hour at 6. Because the place is small, the queues tend to be long. Going on a weekday night is a better idea

Their macarons might not be good but at least their pastries are still decent and worth the try if you don't mind the occasion indulgence. For full review : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/01/antoinette-four-musketeers.htmlOne can tell from the name Kyoto that this is a Japanese inspired cake made of matcha mousse, chestnut creameux and matcha sponge. This does not taste sweet despite the presence of chestnut and the green tea powder used is likely to be authentic for it had a mild bitter aftertaste.I love this Gula Melaka Tart out of the four as the taste and textures is like a haphazard mess but in a good way. The bright yellow exotique coulis on top burst out that sour passionfruit lava which cuts the coconut mousse but hits head on into the next layer of gula melaka cremeux, finger sponge with gula melaka. I have also under-estimated the tart shell which survived the weight of the mousse by maintaining its crispness.The Chloe is made up of yuzu cream and enrobed in white chocolate mousse with a light sponge cake on a crumbly thin almond biscuit. Unlike most yuzu cakes, the generous amount of yuzu centre gives a tartness that balances of the extremely sweet and milky white chocolate. The base is flat one here.The Forbidden Fruit inspired from the Adam and Eve story, is made up green apple mousse, green apple jelly, maple cream with chunks of vanilla scented caramelised apples on a sweet financier cake base. The combination of maple and apple is refreshingly light and the flavours did not clash or overwhelm the other.I hope that these four will stay for good while the older versions can be replaced with new exciting flavours so that the Singapore pastry scene can match up with the rest of the world. And perhaps for those with a sweet tooth, its upcoming CNY catalogue has been released featuring some dark chocolate cake with mandarin orange mousse and also a almond orange macaron.For more at www.dairycream.blogspot.co

This year, Antoinette has come up with 3 Christmas macarons along with 4 other Christmas cakes which are upsized versions of its regular petit cakes.For more pictures visit : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/antoinette-christmas-macarons.htmlRum and raisin macaron/Fruit Cake/Orange Flower In all, these Xmas flavors like fruit cake are not exactly what I prefer but is certainly a welcome innovation. The macaron shells are slightly dry and hard. Hence they are fairly decent but not the best versions in town so far

Lovely place for an afternoon tete-a-tete over scrumptious desserts. The toast with smoked duck breast and poached eggs were delicious. Although the macarons were a tad disappointing, being slightly chewy rather than crumbly and melt-in-your-mouth, their signature chocolate earl grey cake was sublime and more than made amends for the meh macarons
