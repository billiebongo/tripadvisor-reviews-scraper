Pricey food. Even though the food is delicious, but the 1.5 hours wait for a main dish is really not worth it.
Will not recommend this, and definitely will not be back.

We had the escargot, duck confit, beef cheeks and baked salmon. Nothing could be faulted. Beef cheeks were extremely tender and duck confit had the unusual addition of kumquat. Not particularly cheap considering the location but acceptable for the quality.

Nice quiet place to spend time with hubby. Delicious lamb shank and beef cheek. Superb banana chocolate dessert with rum raisin ice cream. Onion soup could be thicker but taste was there :)

I always go to this cafe with my husband, from the time it was at Thomson V and now Thomson Imperial court. My favorite dish is the duck confit and my husband, the lamb shank. Both are superbly tender and moist. Onion soup is awesome too, flavourful and not too salty as how others make it. Price is a bit on the high side but worth the value of the food. Cafe is a bit small and narrow since they moved to the new space so will not be ideal for big gatherings.

Chef Ratha, you do a mean duck confit and a superb soufflé. I really do dig the foie gras as well. Let’s not forget the baked Brie. More pistachios would’ve been great. We loved the unpretentiousness of the food and setting, and you bet we will be back!

What Hubby and I ordered for lunch: foie gras, mushroom soup, duck confit, lamb shank, soufflé Yummy French food, reasonable pricing, very attentive Chef (constant top up of my piping hot water - 5 star service). Cosy setting, small restaurant with seats for less than 30. Wine list pricing is very reasonable. We will be back again for sure.

Sometimes a girl hankers for a great solo lunch in an unpretentious setting where she can just be with her thoughts and amazeballs food.Black Sheep Cafe is it. Have followed Chef from his early days in Seletar Hills and am glad to have found him here again. The duck was excellently crispy and the alcoholic soufflé delightful. If only he could serve the baked brie that has since 'migrated' to House (Dempsey). Will return!

We decided to check out this restaurant after my daughter's choices for her birthday dinner were unavailable.We were pleasantly surprised. Bread served with unsalted butter at the start of the meal reminded us of Europe - fresh, warm & toasty. Left us craving for more. Next came escargots which were ok, but probably the least impressive of what we had that night.Lamb shank was awesome and the beef cheek was yummy. My girl meant to share those with her daddy but she ended up eating most of both! My younger girls shared a seafood linguine which they enjoyed while I had the chicken cordon bleu which everyone wanted a bite of. We ended our dinner with the chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream. No flowing 'lava' and the ice cream was a tad too milky for our liking. The restaurant is rather small with seating for under 30 people inside and maybe 4 outside if you do not mind the traffic going by. The inside is small and cozy and we were there the same time as a french-chinese family with 2 toddlers - 1 was hyper and other was screaming for a good part. Not exactly how one who like to enjoy a lovely dinner, but kids are kids. Was fine after they left and the service staff turned on some background music (which we thought might have helped those kids calmed down earlier).On the whole, a lovely first experience and we will return the next time we are in the area

Went there for lunch on Sat and not many people, so it was nice and quiet. Ordered set lunch that comes with soup, main course, dessert and coffee/tea. Onion soup was delicious, so was the bread, nicely toasted warm. However, the wait for the duck confit was super long. So long that we asked for another serving of bread. Luckily the wait was worth it. The duck had crispy skin and just nice texture meat. Dessert was chocolate fondant, which was yummy with the gooey chocolate oozing out. Perfect pair with the ice cream.Best of all, the price doesn't include GST nor service charge. Set lunch is worth the money. Main course cost almost the same as set lunch!Will come back to try other menu, if their set lunch menu changed

Our family has been patronizing this cafe since the time it started in Jalan Kelulut. We'd go for the usual house specials like the mushroom soup, baked Brie, duck confit, pork cheek and Kahlua soufflé.Did the same this weekend dinner with the kids. Dishes are consistent in their taste, prices have gone up a fair bit though. I suppose this could have been due to the rising labour and rental costs. I liked most of the dishes although the kids found the baked cheese and duck confit too oily.Our set dinner (starters, mains, dessert) for a family of 5 came up to a little over $250. Mid-range fare and definitely not cheap.Might be good if there are some revamp to the menu. We've been eating the same dishes since the day it started business

Desserts are excellent too...
Nice and cozy ambience

Just a try out of this restaurant, which I found on internet (good score by Singaporean restaurant app).You would not expect such a restaurant in this location. Interior is modern and nice, lights just a little to bright.Very friendly service, respond well to all requests.The French food is delicious. Baked brie as starter (yum!), main the fish of the day and a very impressive and light soufflÃ© for dessert. The linguine seafood could use a bit more pepper, but the duck and lamb were tender and tasty.It took some time before it was ready, but still very reasonable. Also, as common in Singapore, not all dishes were served at same time.Overall, great food at a surprising location. I would not hesitate to go there again with friends

We were looking for a quiet place for late a lunch (in the area) which could accommodate our fairly large table and came across this little place situated in Thomson V. We called ahead and made a booming (and I must say, we were looking forward to it as the guy on the phone really built up our expectations).We arrived at 2pm and were seated in a nice area. We got served these printed paper menus and was also informed that the brunch menu was not available (although it stated clearly that brunch was available on Sat/Sun/PH before 5pm). Not much of an issue in all fairness, so we continued to place our orders. This is when the problems started piling on top of each other.Service was non existent, the wait staff took exceptionally long got water service and they got orders wrong. Food started coming out in waves too. First it was the fish and chips, 10 minute later the watery Shepards pie was sent out, 15 minutes after that the vege creps creeped over and 10 minutes later comes the pene in "lobster" sauce (mind you, it was all individual portions). They missed an order, completely and it took the 20 minutes to get it out (at which point all of us were done with the meal). All in all it was a very average place with an average menu and unfortunately below average service

Quiet and relaxing restaurant serving French cuisine. Everything from the bread, french onion soup, main course and dessert are rather good (close to what you would have in a high-end French restaurant). Service is good and fast (not sure why some reviews claim slow service). Recommended for a slow, relaxing Sunday lunch

Expensive, secluded, Food with average taste and priced at an average of $30/mains and $15/starters. Tried the lamb at $39,was well marinated and tender but it just did not deliver the bang. Could do without it . The escargot sauce was flavorful but it seemed like the escargots were just dipped in it and hence did not blend in. The simmered beef was just below average. Won't be going here again, it lacks any lingering experience of good taste

for detailed information, visit http://molly-mia.blogspot.sg/2014/06/mias-review-black-sheep-cafe.htmlvisited with my friends as they found many raves on their duck confit. didn't order that but I did try a bite from my friend's plate, and I wonder why the raves. my chicken in red wine was more decent, but all in all i wonder if it's worth the price (not high end but not exactly very affordable either) and the atrociously long waiting time. we waited an avg of 20 to 30 minutes for our mains and almost 1 hr for the souffle

Had lunch with my wife and ordered ala carte. We were drawn to this place because of the reviews and curiosity did do the cat in this time.For starters, we ordered the French Onion Soup and the Garlic Prawns on Baby Romaine Lettuce. While the Garlic Prawns weren't bad, the French Onion Soup came a tab bland. Passable stuff.For mains, we ordered the Duck Leg Confit and the Seafood Cabonara with Leeks and Asparagus. The duck leg succulent and juicy and still had skin and some fat oozing from it. It was every bit a very nicely done pan fried duck's leg that was cooked over a low heat and slowly cooked. It's almost like tucking into one of Hong Kong's roasted duck's leg sort of juicy and quite enjoyable. An actual confit, it was definitely not.The seafood carbonara was slightly disappointing. Although not a total disaster, the pasta came very slightly undercooked while the sauce had a slightly waxy aftertaste that I can't quite put a finger on. We were pretty thankful we didn't order desserts but we did have beer and lingered on slightly since we were the only few people there for lunch. Total bill for two starters, two mains and two beers came up a few dollars under a hundred. Wouldn't consider it cheap but it's not expensive either.Would I come back? I can't say I was impressed or floored by the food, perhaps the actual chef works evenings. I probably would stop by if I was in the area

This is tucked away in basement of a nondescript building with shops and residential units but, nonetheless, it was packed when we arrived for dinner at 7 pm. Our starters included lobster bisque, escargot and seared foie gras, all of which were delicious. Our mains were pork cheeks, duck confit, seafood carbonara and coq au vin. The pork cheeks and duck confit were particularly good, and were well cooked and well presented. We also ordered three desserts - kahlua souffle, creme brulee and chocolate boudini (kind of lava cake). They were okay, though the souffle was definitely the best of the three. Service was attentive but rather slow - it took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes to finish. Portions were nice. For six of us, the costs (excluding wine or beverage) was quite reasonable, at S$260.We liked the food so much that we are returning the next weekend

I had passed this restaurant at it's previous location in Mayo Road and had always intended to try it. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had moved to Sing Ming Road, a stroll from where I was staying on a recent trip to Singapore. My wife and i ordered dishes that we had had in our at some of our favourite restaurants in Perth. The good news is that the food served at Black Sheep Cafe more than passes muster. My lobster bisque was as good as I have had anywhere. Besides several good size chunks of of lobster in a delicious soup (the stock must have been excellent), it bits of carrot and celery that had bite and crunch. I must mentioned the bread which was really good. If the bread at a restaurant is good, you are unlikely to go wrong with the food. My duck confit was near perfect; crisp on the outside, moist on the inside and loaded with flavour. Chicken in red wine sauce is a French standard that is not terribly hard to cook but difficult to get right. No problem for the chef; this was easily one of the best my wife had tasted. If you like souffle, you need patience. Ours was rewarded with our passion fruit souffle which was perfectly executed. The double chocolate with banana boudini was also a tasty treat. We have always looked for owner chef establishments as we have found these to offer good food and good value. The Black Sheep Cafe fits this bill nicely. The restaurant prices are all you pay, so no service charge or GST. Tip generously. The staff are worth it

The French-style bistro reopens after about year at a more spacious venue in Thomson V's basement spotting a more contemporary and elegant outlook.Several classics remained on the menu such as the Duck Confit with Apple Roesti (26.50 SGD), the Pork Cheeks with Orange Glaze (28.50 SGD) and some new additions like the Fish and Chips with Green Pea Mash, Chicken in Red Wine, Chocolate Boudini and Seafood Carbonara. One of the major plus point is the nett-price policy at Black Sheep Cafe has not changed,The Duck Confit I had was quite decent with crispy skin and juicy, tender flesh paired with savoury apple roesti. If you are just looking for somewhere to meet and have coffee, Black Sheep Cafe now serves Puro Coffee, a Belgian brand. I had their Cappuccino which is a very balanced cup of coffee. It was not too strong and rather fragrant. Coffee and tea are part of the lunch sets too
