This eatery is cheap even if you order the fish. The food generally quite nice and you always see the long queue. They serve quite fast but still you might need to queue for 15 mins or more sometime.

there is always a queue there. they serve porridge with a big variation of toppings: fried fish, meat, tofu, vegetables. the taste is great and the price unbelievably cheap. highly recommended
