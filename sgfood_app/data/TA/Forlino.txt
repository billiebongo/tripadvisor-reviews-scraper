view is superb, food is average, tried the set lunch menu. There is no one at the front desk, was wondering around until someone serve us to our table.

So glad to fine one more Elegant Italian restaurant with nice food, great view and VIP service. will definitely revisit.
3
Nothing wow about the spread. Had the executive lunch set. Besides the very average Italian food, the serving where the meats are concern is too little for the price. The view isn’t that fantastic.
4
food is ok but their desserts is really outstanding. Service is good but not friendly enough.
a really nice atmosphere with amazing view. highly recommended
4
The quality of food is good. I loved the ambience, day or night. It will be a nice and romantic venue for couples, especially with the night view.
3
Pasta was really poor. Seriously I can cook pasta better than that. Waiters politely ask if you want white truffle with that sir....be sure to ask the price because its $20 a gram. For the price of the dishes I figure they could have added it before hand. Restaurant was empty expect for some very noisy people behind us. Overall disappointed
3
Overall dinner was okay. We had ala carte from the menu. The pportioning was really small. Not value for the price paid. A plus thing was that the food was delicious. Service was so so. More attention needed. We have to ask for our water to be replenished. Wouldn't recommend.
4
This was my first time and the restaurant had an excellent view, staff was very attentive. Food was excellent though it would have been a little more satisfying. If the courses were a little more since the portions were very small. Overall it was good food, good service but be prepared to pay as it is pricey

Had 4 course set lunch on Sun 10 Dec. So sad to say that we could not eat any of the food. All food tasted wrongly flavoured. Very salty and badly imbalanced flavours in everything from salad entree to main. There were 4 of us dinners, non of us could finished any food on the plates. It was that bad. The ice cream that come with dessert was the only thing that was eatable. I didn't want to write this review but had try to let the restaurant know directly but know body respond. So I assumed there will be no change in the kitchen. I had to write review because the food was so shockingly bad. I have never experience such bad tasting food with my dinning in Singapore. After been to Forlino, it made me scared to eat out at new restaurant. Hope this review will be helpful to potential dinners.

Left the restaurant before eating. Within 15min of ordering, the waiter came thrice to remind us that our 2-year old son has to keep silent as he may be affecting the next table of customers having a business dinner. The business diners were definitely laughing louder than any noise that my son could make through his pacifier. In the 15min after ordering, nothing was served except water and the 3 reminders from the water that we should move to another seat so as not to disturb the business diners. The alternative seat seemed equally far from their table as our present one. Having been reminded thrice, we decided to call off the birthday celebration dinner for my wife and left.
5
It is a rare occasion that I will give commendation of exceptional service. However, Forlino food and service are really good. Instead of selecting their set menu, they recommend you to customize your set.
4
The ambience was good, it will be even better during evening I think. We ordered the executive 4 course set lunch. Quality was good but I do feel thatl it is a little bit pricey as compared to other restaurat.
4
I visited Forlino for business lunch set on a week day which is "value for money" for 3 course meals plus coffee. Ambience was fantastic as it was not too busy accompanied by excellent service from staff. Would definitely be back again.
5
Went for a friend's birthday.. amazing views and ambience..service was prompt ..wine list long enough and food so tasty..
5
It was a quiet evening when we came here. What a stunning view of the most scenic part of SG. Service was excellent. The food was good too.
1
Terrible food. Sea urchin pasta was a disaster . Did not taste fresh at all. Slow cooked pork was tough
4
This is an institution in Singapore. Considering how quickly restaurants are opening and closing these days, it's incredible that Forlino have managed to stay the pace over the past decade or so! The food was good, and service was exceptional. Try to get the corner table by the front window for the best view ;

My friend and I came here for lunch. The food was really good and the set lunch was value for money.The service wasn’t bad that’s why my rating is still a 4. I am not sure if one of the waiting staff was just having an off day but when I ordered wine with my set lunch, it was forgotten so I had to follow up. It was not even busy when we arrived. I didn’t mind that too much because my drink eventually arrived. What got me was the bill.My friend did not have wine. As the wine was additional $10++ with the set meal, my friend said I can just give her $10 in cash and we split the bill in half and setlle it via credit card to make it simpler. We didn’t really check the receipt but when I came home, I noticed they charged $16++ for the wine. It’s not a lot of money but it’s just a bit irritating that the mistake of forgetting my wine was not really “corrected”. It was probably keyed in as a separate wine order instead of as part of the set lunch.Despite this, it’s still worth going there at least for the set lunch. Just make sure you check your bill properly
5
We had an excellent meal here. Fine dining done well. The menu was Italian. An incongruous touch was the sparkling water from France! We had the steak - nice and tender and sea bass, cooked well. To finish, we had the tiramisu, which was a really light version of the dessert with cappuccino ice cream and mascarpone mousse, very more-ish. An additional bonus was watching the lighted fountains and lasers from Marina Bay Sands during the dinner. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a special meal.
5
We visited here as a family complete with our baby granddaughter in her buggy. The staff were excellent and ensured we had a roomy table with more than enough space to leave the baby in the bassinet. The food was excellent and presented beautifully and the service was second to none - unobtrusive yet attentive. The views are amazing with a panoramic scene around the bay, the Merlion - it’s a perfect place to watch the nightly light shows from whilst enjoying incredible food
5
Nice place to dine, price is reasonable for fine dining and both myself and hubby love it. We will come again!
4
A very good italian food, it is not my first time there, most likely not the last one. Service is war and efficient.
5
Attentive, they prepared a complimentary wedding anniversary macaron dessert that pleases us. The view was spectacular with merlion sprouting and in front of us was the marina bay sands. Picture perfect shots were taken. Highly recommended!
5
Definitely come here again - such a divine experience. The food was to die for, thanks for Forlino for looking after us like queens.
5
great views of National Day events and fireworks - buffet was excellent with a delicious choice of starters including fresh oysters. staff attentive and great customer service
5
Making reservation via Chope was very easy and smooth. Response was fast too. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner, much to our guests satisfaction. We had great evening.
3
The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. The location is inside a building next to the Fullerton bay hotel. We had brunch there and had a good time. Sat next to the window so we were able to have a lovely meal with the view.
5
We had dinner here and the view was the Singapore National Day Rehearsal, so we saw the beautiful fireworks. It's short but really unexpected. We ordered a set dinner and it was very good portion and delicious. Service also impeccable and friendly.
3
Frankly the restaurant is disappointing. The food is competent but service is lacking in warmth and attention. A 10% service charge is imposed because diners wouldn't tip voluntarily.
5
My wife and I ate at Forlino for iur wedding anniversary. We had the degustation menu and asked for the waiter to recommend a good wine to pair with the food. The Italian red that followed was a truly delightful as it conbined in so many different ways with each dish. Especially the cheese. Highly recommend for special occasions both for the food and the view. You won't regret it
3
Enjoyed the cheese that is served with the bread :) instead of the usual olive oil/butter. Ordered the cod and it was very fresh and creamy. Only disappointment was the overbaked fondant
5
Forlino has an awesome view, day and evening. Service is always superb, and the food is good. This is a great choice for a special occasion with a special someone. Their weekday lunchdeals are good value for money as well.
5
Went for the 4course set lunch + free flow prosecco, food was great, so was the prosecco. Staff was attentive and friendly. Had a nice table facing the merlion. Definitely dont mind going there again!
5
We went to Forlino for a Mothers Day brunch and it was fantastic. The staff were friendly and the food was wonderful. A great meal was had by all!
5
It was really great time in Forlino. I visited the Forlino on 24-Jun-2017 for a dinner with my girl friend to celebrate her birthday. Every foods we ordered were served with detail explanations of ingredients and really good tastes. The atmosphere was also very nice with Marina bay night view.
4
Beautiful View from the restaurant, nice decoration. Big wine list. The food is good, special the beef, and in good presentation. The pasta is just ok, not as good as other people's comments. Everything quite nice, however, we heard the staff talking about other customers behind.
4
Lovely setting, well drilled staff and a great menu unless you're vegetarian - then the choices are a little sparse. Start with the burrata - it was amazingly good and they offer a great selection of wines. There's not much to fault here, the quality of the food was superb, the wine was crisp and perfectly paired and the location and view are very good. If you're looking for a trustworthy high end restaurant - Forlino is an easy answer in the Singapore CBD area
4
We are there to celebrate my partner's birthday, and they surprise us with a birthday cake, they give us a table with a nice view too, thank you!Only thing is the cod fish we order, there's a funny smell, overall are good, anyway we enjoy our dinner, and will go back again
4
Had a team dinner at Forlino. Was a little difficult to find but once seated, the view is certainly spectacular - I could see the Merlion from my seat as well as the skyline of Marina Bay which allowed me to spend some time debating the merits of the Marina Bay Sands design! Service was prompt, polite and efficient. Hospitable without being overbearing. The food was good but not excellent - but given the range of Italian restaurants in Singapore, it is really difficult to stand out. Was a little disappointed by the desert options which were somewhat limited in scope but the tiramisu was apparently very nice. Ten of us ate and the bill came to slightly under S$1,000 - so an average cost per meal of S$100 - including some beer and wine , which I do not think is too bad. So if you are in the Raffles Place area and want Italian then would recommend this restaurant but primarily for its location
1
Was looking forward to the dinner to celebrate our friend's birthday. Was very impressed by the building and view when arrived. Everything thereafter went in opposite directions from our first impression. After studying the menu for a while & ready to give our orders, then we were informed of no Angus beef & black cod fish due to no arrival. This would usually have been informed after we're shown to table and seated. Typical fine dining restaurant would engage customers in small chat especially when food is brought to table to introduce to us the dish and what's used. Again, none of such service. Another episode on the service is the poor alertness that service crew didn't top up our water glass when water level is low, and when we asked for water top up, service crew only top up for some and not all. This is not even fine dining service that's missing in this instance. It's basic common sense at any dining place. Lastly, the food quality & standard leave nothing desirable. My friends who ordered pasta with wagyu & truffle related their food to meepok that's too dry & clumpy, in both taste & presentation. Certainly we wouldn't have paid $30+ for meepok though. Overall, wouldn't recommend at all for even first visit. Better to take our apensin elsewhere.
3
We went for the weekend brunch. You truly pay for your money's worth. Food wasn't great. Could simply be limited to just the weekend brunch. Suggest diners give the alw carte a try instead.
5
Service is good and the food is excellent. Great place for couples on special events. Highly recommended.
4
Plan for any special occasion for the love of the food and the views from the top. Being vegetarian, the options were less but still the waiter and the chef prepared special food for us, customized to our choices and preferences. Much appreciated. The class of the restaurant was evident in the taste, appearance of the food and service
4
We went to Forlino to celebrate a friend's birthday. The view was breath-taking and the decor of the restaurant nice and elegant. We all agreed that the set lunch was delicious and good value for money. The birthday girl was very pleased when she got an extra dessert with her name written on the plate. We will certainly visit the restaurant again soon
4
Want a regal treat that doesn't cost an arm or leg? Forlino weekend brunch with 4 courses perfectly ensure your morsels match the picturesque view of Marina Bay Sands stretched out in front of you. The ambience is of an imperial touch. Make this your Sunday treat
1
I made my reseravation for Forlino on Chope. The reservation was confirmed. Then I received a call from Forlino that said the restaurant had been booked out for a private event and I would have to move my reservation. I chose to go to OSO instead which was lovely. I asked Chope and Forlino to cancel my reservation in their system seeing I kept getting reminders of my reservation that the restaurant canceled. And now, I've been asked to give a review of a restaurant where I apparently went to dinner because the restaurant and Chope are too lazy to cancel it in their system. So, here's to being lazy & terrible
5
The restaurant has amazing views of the Marina Bay. Equally impressive is its food. We particularly enjoyed the lobster bisque, spaghetti vongole and pork belly. They were packed with so much flavour! We thought the trio of eggs pre-appetiser was good but not quite worth its price. We also felt the minestrone soup was worth skipping. They serve foccacia bread and shredded cheese and an amuse bouche (burrata cheese) complimentary and these were very tasty.The service staff were all attentive, friendly and prompt. They gave good menu recommendations and even surprised my partner with a birthday dessert. It was a very memorable dining experience for us and we cannot wait to visit Forlino again to try their other menu items
5
I love love love this restaurant. Everything about! The setting, the ambience, the view and of course, the food! Fine dining in the middle of Raffles Place, with an incredible view of Marina Bay. Rain or shine, the experience is different but no less beautiful!Visited with my team, this is our go to place for lunch treats! The food is unique, flavour combinations mouthwatering. Lunches are great value with a wonderful selection of the Chef specials. I particularly love their pastas!Their best kept secret? A Super affordable champagne lunch every Saturday! Definitely make this your next destination
4
Forlino. Would highly recommend Forlino to any-one who enjoys great Italian food & hospitality at fantastic value! Decided to try this place after numerous recommendations & wasn't disappointed. The menu was great & it was hard to narrow down my selection. Staff were attentive & the food was delicious. Some of the tastiest Italian food I've eaten in SGP. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure must be delicious. The prices are definitely high, especially for the wine, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. However with such an exquisite experience we are looking forward to going back soon
3
For the prices they charge, the view of Marina Bay and the airs they put on you would think this was amazing. But it's not. It's ok, average, while charging sky high prices. I actually became sick as a result of their seafood pasta or cappaccio which is never a good sign.Service was sporadic and set lunch was ok not great.Decor is very bland and beige too.Not a place I would recommend
4
I last visited Forlino a year ago, wasn't impressed with the swordfish and lava cake then so didn't thought of returning. Am glad i went there again recently, menu has changed and quality of the dishes have greatly improved! Will be back
5
A very good place for Italian food in Singapore. The view is great as well. A must come back place!!
4
Love the food there as the quality was good (especially the quail) but the mille fruille can be improved. Wine came non-stop and that made me and my friend very happy :)
5
It's our anniversary ... the staff has surprised us with a complimentary dessert and arranged a window seat for us...
2
First came to this restaurant 7 years ago but it has changed significantly since new management took over. Food is not worth the price you pay, and the nice service staff can't save the experience.
5
Good service with staff that knows their food menu well. Ambiance was good, and staff were able to provide good recommendations for starters and mains.
2
Fantastic view and it really should be an excellent meal given how much it is but for us it was let down by the service.There were 4 of us eating and only 3 mains were served together and we had to send one back because it was cold. After waiting for 5 minutes for our friend to be served and being repeatedly told it was coming the two of us with food were forced to eat it otherwise it would have gone cold. We actually finished our food before our friend was served and the returned cold dish also bought back out. The last dish was also wrong and upon explaining this to the waiter he proceeded to argue with us rather than just apologising. All in all a disappointing experience especially as it was a birthday dinner for our friend
4
Nice ambiance, great view, good location but can improve on service. The waiter didn’t brief us on the menu, just serve the drinks directly to us once we sit down. I drive thus can’t drink, he should at least check whether we prefer alcohol or non-alcohol. Also, it’s valentine’s day, it will be good if the restaurant can give a small token for the ladies/couple such as a stalk of rose, one small piece of chocolate, it will make the dinner ends with a smile (this is my partner’s expectation as it’s a special day & some restaurants do take note of such little gesture)
5
Went without much expectation as we were there for the view but the food turn out beyond our expectation . Service was also excellent as the waitress attending to us throughout the meal was very attentive and take time to explain every dish in the degustation menu that we ordered . Every dish was simply fabulous
5
My girlfriends and I went to Forlino's for the Sunday lunch set with free flow Prosecco and it was amaaaazzzzing. Service was superb! the service staff, Celion was very attentive and topped up our glasses ever so often... The food was very value for money as well! it was also very quiet and nice with a perfect view of the bay area. :)
5
Excellent service of the staff: they did their best to accommodate our requests, help select according to our taste and even make a risotto that was no longer on the menu. The music playlist made an great ambiance
4
Beautiful restaurant with a view of the river and merlion. Nice 3-course business set lunch.
Service not as warm as I would expect though...
Food portion is on the smaller side.
5
Excellent value for money. Friendly staff and always attentive. Good view of the bay as well. Will be back again

6 of us were here for New year's Eve dinner.Located on the second floor overlooking Marina Bay, the view for fireworks is spectacular. Except there is a rather large overhanging roof, which blocked the views of the higher rockets.The table was right by the window, but was very unstable and the the foldout wings were leaning precariously. Don't look up - the chandeliers are caked with dust and with plenty of dead or missing bulbs.There was some sort of tinny piped music, which all of us thought came from a first generation Bluetooth speaker at a neighboring desk.The food was good enough, although I'm not sure it was worth the money we spent. The foie gras was a bit stringy, the lobster the size of my pinky and the wagyu beef ribs fat as can be. The dessert, a yuzu sorbet ball, filled with ricotta was quite good.The staff is friendly, although I don't understand why you would start every sentence with "thank you"... Half of us had empty plates piled up when new courses arrived, while the other half was cleared off.For $500/head, I would expect a lot more attention to detail
4
My wife and I visited Forlino on the last night of our honeymoon. We are huge fans of Italian food and therefore have very high expectations regarding quality and taste - Forlino did not disappoint. The wine list was plentiful and reasonably priced; the menu was varied but not over complicated, the food was exceptionally cooked and fantastically presented and the staff were friendly and polite. The view over Marina Bay were incredible (made it in time for the 8pm light show); it is fantastically placed to enjoy the lights and ambience of the MB area. Highly recommended.
3
I went last night to forlino with my boss ( was our 4th time there) : as usual the cuisine of the Japanese chef was perfect , i ordered several dishes of the white truffle menu ( uova, cold delicious cappelini, and very tasty spaghetti with lobster) , all really delicious. But ( and i should write BUT) in a very competitive F&B market like Singapour , some staff still seem to ignore that a positive restaurant experience is a mix of quality food and good service. Regarding the latter point i was very surprised by the rudeness , impoliteness of the manager when we asked to change a table , showing several times his lack of patience and self control... this type of behavior in such a restaurant is just a big mistake and requires urgent training.
4
This is one of my favourite Italian restaurant and has been here for a couple of time, I was there for an anniversary lunch and they have a 4 course set menu at $44++ and I find it is value for money and the food was great, ambience was great and you will be overlooking the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands, do ask for window seats to get the view
1
No flavour, no character, no identity... At half the price I would not come back.From the amuse bouche, we were wondering whether they missed some seasoning. Turns out all dishes are disappointing. Foie gras is gross, scallops tasteless, wine average. On a positive note, view is great, and dÃ©cor is Nice
4
If there is no event, this will be a good place for couples to enjoy their meal with good view. It's not suitable for big group of guests if they have loud voice as it will disturb other guests beside them. Area is not as big as what I expected but overall is acceptable
4
Ordered two appetisers to share, four main dishes for four of us, a bottle of wine and one dessert to celebrate a birthday. We were very impressed with the venue and the ambience. The setting makes us feel private because there was a lot of space between tables. Service was prompt. Price is on a high side but you are paying for the exclusive view of the bay. We like every dish especially pasta - they did a great job. Overall good experience but a bit pricey for everyday meal. Perhaps a special occasion. We didn't get any extra dessert for this birthday though - we usually do when we go to restaurants for birthday celebrations.
4
Celebrated my first wedding anniversary in Forlino. Was given a seat with Merlion and MBS view. My wife and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance.
4
For the first time me and hubby going to Forlino, the restaurant it quite nice with beautiful view and the food was delicious definitely will come again
5
Just nice amount of Italian dishes and Prosecco with an amazing view of the Marina Bay! The service is very professional and very friendly stuffs. I would definitely go back again!
5
We went for a business lunch and they treat us excellent. I asked for a table with views and they offered the best they have bear the corner. The food was tasty and portions are enough. Business set lunch is reasonable 38++
4
Visited this restaurant for the first time , though I had heard of it for some time now The access route to the restaurant is a bit funny. Once u alight from the lift @Level2 , u must climb a flight of stairs and go through labyrinthine passages to arrive at the restaurant. But in the end it was worth all of that Service staff is brilliant with very forthcoming service . Always with a smile and happy to help. Food was great too. Fresh , well cooked and tasteful Must try the Pesto Risotto, never had one before but this one was great Beautiful views over the Marina Bay Area. A bit pricey I guess that may be the reason why only 2 tables were occupied when we arrived Last order at 10pm Highly recommend this place
3
Let me start with the good, the food was great (loved the foie gras) and the scenery was beautiful. Service was prompt and efficient as well.Now, the issue for me was I called the restaurant in advance to let them know I was there to celebrate my marriage. They replied that they would let the chef know to prepare something. However, while I was there nothing came. Perhaps I should've let them know of my request but I didn't want to mar the experience with my wife being there.If not for that, I would have given 5 stars. All in all, the food and scenery are great, it would've have been perfect if I didn't have the request
3
After reading the reviews I do have very high expectation of the food quality. The view is gorgeous, you get to oversee the Esplanade and Marina Bay Sands. However do take note that the food is fusion of Japanese styled Italian cuisine. Not exactly my cup of tea but I have to say the fruit tart is really good
4
The restaurant is located at the far end of the building, with a unblock view of the merlion and Marina Bay Sands. The place was very stylish decorated with a cozy and old school feel. Currently the restaurant was having a promotion for Flavours of The Fullerton Heritage 2016. A 3 course set lunch for this promotion cost $35++ and available everyday.I was served iced water but it was not refilled regularly. The meal was started with amuse bouche and bread. The amuse bouche was a creamy truffle mousse, topped with crispy rice, which pop in the mouth. The bread was soft and warm, served with thin sliver slices of cheese.Appetizer : Burrata CheeseMango Olive Tapenade, Parma Ham, Rosemary FoamThe cheese was light and soft like tofu, where one can slice easily with just the fork. The olive mixture added a punch to the slightly bland dish.Main : Tagliatelle alla BologneseKagoshima Wagyu Beef Ragout, Parmigiano ReggianoThe handmade pasta was soft and tender. The dish was served pipping hot. Looked simple but it was delicious and very filling.Dessert : Coconut Panna CottaPassion Fruit Sauce, White Mango Compote, Mango TuilesThe dessert was light and tangy, without too creamy.Overall the food was great and filling too. However I was quite disappointed with its service. I had not finished my amuse bouche when I was served the Appetizer course. Turned out that there was a wedding dinner that night. The staffs were rushing the lunch crowd, so that they could start to prepare for the dinner. I wish that I had been informed when I placed my order. I felt kind of being rushed through the meal
3
The food was undeniably good, the food standard definitely saved itself the average review I must say. However, I really hope something could be done at the management level. I made a reservation via the Chope app, requesting for a slice of cake for my fiancÃ©. Waiter came to me (a lady) and wished me Happy birthday instead. I had to clarify that it was my husband's birthday, not mine. This really would have been alright had the other saga not occured. I ordered the "Risotto alla Carbonara", waited for 34 minutes and when my food was finally served! Came this plate of Risotto with green sauce. It was the "Risotto al Pesto". I quickly rectified with the waitress who took my order, she looked me in the eye (still in a polite tone, i have to say in her defence) and said, "But you said risotto pesto just now!" "No, when you repeated my order, you said 'Risotto alla Carbonara' as well.""Okay." Waitress left and changed my order quickly. (Thank you for that)My partner, however, waited a good 47minutes for his Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe to be served. It really felt like we were forgotten by the waiting staff :( The 2 tables around us who arrived later than us had their dinner served and they were almost at dessert while we were still... waiting... We were famished, we reminded the wait staff twice that we were still awaiting our dinner. No extra bread was given to us, to at least comfort our ravenous stomach by then. To show that they are apologetic at least? Or is the food usually served after this long a wait time? Really hope the management could improve on these:- 1) communication from the waiter to the kitchen, 2) training for the wait staff to be more empathetic towards customers (famished, cold and having a birthday) It was quite a soiled birthday for the husband, he left feeling disappointed and grouchy. A hungry man, an angry man :( I didn't feel too good about the experience as well, probably will not recommend my friends to visit Forlino for celebrations :

Tonite's experience at Forlino is an example where a great experience and superb service can supercede everything else!!! To be honest, we've been to Forlino many times, because of the view, the gorgeous ambiance with their nice chandeliers and their competent food! However, tonite (which I think maybe a one-off), while our starters and pastas were good, our mains (the grilled fish and grilled lamb) were too hard and dry! We were disappointed as we've been to Forlino many times and have brought friends and vistors there many times, so we gave it the benefit of the doubt and was willing to forgive and forget about the mains that were less than competent tonite!! However, when we didn't finished our grilled lamb, Lorenzo (their director) enquired and was very gracious to make amends and gave us free dessert! This was so delightful, as it changed our experience from 4 star to 5 star. This is exemplary of what I would expect for fine-dining restaurants. Will definitely continue to support them
5
Great view of the waterfront. Conducive venue for business lunch too considering its in the middle of CBD.
4
The food is very good, value for money, spacious and comfortable environment, and that with its prime location in the Marina Bay, good place for a lunch/dinner date.
4
Quiet restaurant with relent ambience. Marvellous view of Singapore's bay front throughout the whole restaurant. Good and service were excellent too.
5
My guests were satisfied to spend great time at Forlino. Food is quite nice and view of Marina bay is wonderful.
5
Service and food was excellent. With a very nice view as well. Will definitely be back again! Thank you!!
4
Although I had business lunch and I had enough time, we had enjoyable time at your restaurant.
Tastes, serving time, location and cost performance were totally excellent
4
We went here for brunch recently and were very happy with the food and the service. Of course the view of Marina Bay and the Merlion and the swarms of Chinese tourists is uniquely Singapore, but the flavors at FORLINO are world-class. Recommended.
3
Order set menu. Environment and service is nice.
Food is so so. The lasagna is too salty but Wagyu beef is nice. Other menu, bread and dessert are just norms. Good place for romantic dinner ☺
4
Hosted lunch here for business associates. The deco is nice. Some parts of the restaurant faces the F1 track as well. This is a good place to host clients without costing a bomb. The decor of the restaurant also gives a classy feel. They have 3 course set lunches priced at SGD38++/pax which is very reasonable for such setting. Had the mixed veg soup, fish fillet and mango pudding. While the soup has nothing to shout about, the fish fillet and mango are nice
4
Brought the gf there for her birthday dinner. Service was great, personable, and the food was exceptional! One thing though, I mentioned upon booking that it was a birthday celebration, but they didn't do or provide anything special, even though they said they would. Not a big deal (we were so full after the excellent meal we couldn't possibly eat anymore), but thought its something expected. I'd still go back nevertheless :)
4
Meal, service and ambience were fine, but for any newcomer the location of the restaurant is not clear and you can spend some time looking for it.
5
Nice environment for couples, the food was great with reasonable price. I would pay a next visit to it!
4
a very nice fine-dining restaurant with million-dollars view, overlooking to the marina bay and great buildings in Singapore
3
First of all, it's extremely difficult to find it! Hidden in the most obscure way you can think of on seond floor of One Fullerton with no signs to guide you. Well the view is definitely amazing overlooking MBS and the river. But you can get it easily in any other restaurants along the bay. The lunch set around $48 is all right. Good quality food ingredients but my fish could be cooked with more salt. I can only say it's good for business meetings but I won't come back for the food or romantic dinner. Average but not impressive. Follow me on serenagourmet to find out more

I went Forlino for two occasions. First was for my brother's birthday. The food was of good standard and the staff was friendly and approachable. Second was for my 3rd aunt 60th birthday. We manage to book the private room which had a nice view of scenery and the set course meal provided was really good. The staffs also ensured that the birthday celebration was a success helping us in all ways

Don't go, this is a tourist trap. Firstly this is like dining in a soulless hotel restaurant, no ambience whatsoever. The complimentary bread was like a door stop and no butter or olive oil with it but hard grated cheese on the side, not sure how we were supposed to eat this. The candles on all the tables were not lit so we asked for ours to be lit and the waitress did so but them slammed the candle decoration back on the table. It was freezing cold. we were, told it was busy when we tried to book at 7pm so asked for 8pm and when we turned up it was very quiet for a Thursday evening. The starters were ok but boring, the main courses we both left, the black cod dish was very average and just covered in black ink, it was just a mushy mess on the plate, the lamb dish was sent back as it was undercooked and cold, the second attempt at this dish was still no better, we left most of the two main courses and we were not asked if we enjoyed our food or offered a dessert so we paid in full and left without anyone asking a question and the plates still on the table as we left. Please don't waste your money, we spent 250sgd and it was not worth 10sgd. we gave the restaurant a score of 1/10 and that's being generous

As others have written, the view here is really lovely and the location is prime. For a Friday night at 7:30, the restaurant was not even half full. It's nice to see the Marina Bay from this level and really, every table as a view. The food was nice and reasonably priced. My friends and I had the burrata, hokkaido scallop and vegetable soup as starters and then enjoyed 2 different fish dishes and the lamb chops which were all good. The tiramisu that we shared was yummy and was made with a special twist that I won't spoil if you order it. I found the service, however, to be a little off. Our waitress seemed distracted, didn't offer to explain the specials, actually gave a funny look when I asked to have the table candles lit (duh!), didn't make any menu suggestions or do any of the normal things good servers do ("hi my name is ___ and welcome" or "how are you tonight?"). Maybe I'm spoiled but I think that's an important part of the restaurant experience

The minute one enters the restaurant, one can't help but look at the view! Wonderful view of the Marina. It is an Italian restaurant, and while I was here, the restaurant owner had flown his mother and two of her friends all the way from Italy to cook real Italian food for us. Hospitality was wonderful. Pesto was great and the veal belly was highly unusual. All in all a memorable experience

Came here with a group of girlfriends on a Saturday for their weekend free-flow prosecco brunch. The restaurant is in the prime location of second level of One Fullerton with an amazing view and beautiful decor. The prosecco brunch is one of the most economical I've had in Singapore, $44 for the food and $40 more for free flow prosecco. Food is served to you. There aren't that many varieties and the taste is not to die for, although dessert was good and so was the prosecco :) The whole time we were there, there was just our table one other one, but we didn't mind, as we really enjoyed ourselves in the beautiful and relaxing environment.For the price, the setting and the view I'd say it's worth it

We came here for a friend's surprise birthday. However we didnt mention to the service crew. To our surprise they gave us a compliment personalize dessert for the birthday girl because they heard us singing "happy birthday". The food was made with so much of passion and every bite of each food we had was just like a carnival in our mouth. Great job to the Chef, a handsome chap! We would also like to compliment Celion (i hope i spelt her name correctly) one of the waitress for being very attentive. She went the extra mile to recommend food based on individual preference e.g my pregnant and Hindu friends. Service was prompt and cozy ambience made our fine dining a fine experience!

I had a quick diner after business before heading to the airport. Perfect tourist spot facing the Marina Bay, Sands, etc.
I only had baked salmon - well executed.
I recommend it.
3
The restaurant has an amazing view of the Marina Bay. Some parts of the restaurant are pretty chic. Food was sufficiently delightful. My fish was slightly overcooked. Service was just trim and proper. Quite a pleasant experience overall.
4
Food was excellent! but there are times where we had issue getting the services from the waiter / waitress although there isn't alot of guest in the restaurant but overall it's a great place to go with excellent view of singapore river / MBS etc..
5
The three-course business lunch (SGD38++) is totally worth the time and the money. We were served warm and fresh homemade focaccia bread soon as we were seated. I have the pea soup, the red mullet and the cheese board. All superbly prepared and plated. The service was attentive and seemed to great pride in their offerings. The decor was a tad old-fashioned for me but the view of the bay more than made up for it. I'd highly recommend this place for a business lunch or a romantic meal. And kids are welcome

Enjoyed a very nice evening with a dinner for two at Forlino. Very scenic with our table just next to the wide window with full view of the Marina Bay area. The service was good, with the service crew attentive and friendly.We ordered a Classic Set and a Steak Duet. The quantity was just right for the two of us, as we were not too hungry. As for quality, I would say generally it was pretty good, although the cod fish dish was a bit "confusing" for us as we felt it had too many flavours competing for our taste buds.A nice complementary anniversary and birthday chocolate dessert was specially presented to us, which was very thoughtful and we really appreciated it.Overall, nice enjoyable experience

The food at this place was a joke. The carbonara tasted like mac & cheese, the swordfish was served in two fake looking patties. One of the worst Italian dining experiences in Singapore. The best things were uncooked such as the beef carpaccio and all the aged Parmagiano. Save your money and go to one of the many excellent Italian restaurants on the island. The service and setting, however, were excellent. Great views of the Bay. We also had to walk through a long and odd entryway to arrive in the restaurant.
5
The food at Forlino is very tasty and refined, with a great view on the Marina Bay Sands. Do ask for a table close to the window it's worth it ! The service is impecable, with a lot of details on the food and the preparation, which are very useful and interesting. We really enjoyed our dinner there, and you will too!

It was a surprised birthday dinner treat and Forlino was chosen as it was an ideal location facing the marina.We planned to just picked the ala carte menu but decided to try their set menu specially prepared for the week in conjunction with bank credit card promotion. A seven course fine dinning meal as a fraction of the cost... And we were not disappointed. The dishes were well prepared and cooked and to make the whole dining experience great, we had an enthusiastic service staff who took enough care to explained the dishes we consumed. Every details were explained and each mouthful was gastronomic experience of both taste and senses. Thanks to the chefs and Forlino for coming out a great collaboration with the bank to give us this experience. Kudos

My friend and I enjoyed our first dining experience at Forlino. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly staff and brought to our cosy table near the glass window. Then the main waiter Celion recommended to us the special degustation menu created for the citibank #100gourmet promotion. It was perfect. The appetisers of mushroom mousse and burrata were already so impressive: like the first chapter of a great novel that entreats the reader to go to the next chapter, Forlino's first two dishes made us look forward to what would unfold next in our culinary adventure. The entrÃ©e of red mullet was amazing! How on earth did the chefs come up with the ingenious idea of putting ham on a fish and yet allow these odd ingredients to bring out each others' flavours so well? The foie gras was cleverly prepared with an onion and kaffir lime jus that masks the strong taste of the liver while giving a rich complimentary flavour to this classic dish. The ravioli was pure fun, really. We were delighted with the freshness of the seafood and the squid ink sauce (which I thought initially was the plate decoration because it looked so artistic!). Just as the main course of veal shank was served, the fireworks came on from a distance (it was Chingay festival). What a beautiful coincidence! The veal melted in our mouths and it's taste was accentuated by the lemon and vegetable puree. And the dessert was a lovely pairing of dark chocolate tart with white chocolate ice cream which they froze using nitrogen so it's extra smooth. Best of all, the staff surprised us with a complimentary birthday cake for my friend and sang us a birthday song to make our evening one of the most memorable ever! Finally, guest Chef Chris Naylor, the talented creator of the awesome menu that we just marvelled at, came out in person to chat with us and what an honour it was! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends!

My first impression was good when I come there. The restaurant was beautifully decorated. I've been invited to an Asian wedding. A design of pink roses on a white ground. All the settings on the table with these glasses and knifes was be perfect. I like it. The food was actually pretty good there. however, Staff worker haven't professional yet. They were still forgot something with our order or served slowly. but almost everything fine with us. We had a nice time when we enjoyed there.

Fantastic view, amazing wine, starters blew main course out of the water. Bread was bad and desert was alright!
3
Starters are good, but mains are average. Staff are friendly and helpful but don't really know about the food.
5
The servers are really knowledgeable and the food is good with excellent service provided by the restaurant. The view is fantastic as well :)

Average food but good view. Service was slow and I was late for meeting because of the delayed service

what a great surprise, i was directed by a common friend where he told me that he had a great experience, i know he was over excited as at Forlino he did propose to his now wife to be. So i gave it a try, i made a booking, very nice lady over the phone, all the detailed were taken and i told that it was my wife birthday. Once there in that evening, although it was a bit odd the way to arrive to the restaurant once there you quickly forget it.What a beautiful view of the bay! much better that very ( too very) hight building. we got a nice window table, service although we are in Singapore and the expectations are not very high... believe it or not it was faultless .. wow rear to see nowadays.. anyway the highlight it was the food...what a treat, a perfect combination of Italian ingredients with a touch of Japan... well no wonder the chef is from Japan, nice guy, little english but very humble , he just pass by to say a quick hi... great to see that they did not forget my wife birthday and they provide a small nice cake with candle, a bit cliche' but again it was a good touch... the home made spaghetti with the sea urchin are amazing but you must love the sea.. again Kudos to all.. well done will be back with friends... thank you all

It's a regular fine dine; went with my husband for my birthday dinner. Food was decent nothing extraordinary and service was also just decent. Was not super impressed for the price you pay.Views might be good but in the night you can hardly see anything due to glass reflection.Overall "Decent" place
3
Went as a group of 8. The view and food are excellent! Can't say the same for the service .. They'd forgotten one of our guests' main dish. So we sat there awkwardly waiting while all our mains got cold - no apologies ! Slow service considering it wasn't busy on a Saturday night!
2
Great location. Nice ambience.But it will not get any Michelin star.(1) Forgot to serve a side dish(2) Ignored request for more bread (3) Served pasta in front of me as I was reaching out for bread(4) Shoved black truffle under my nose without asking if I want to smell. It is only truffle
5
Due to my husband's medical condition, we had to choose a place that we think is clean and not too crowded for Boxing Day dinner.After a long search we ended up in Forlino.We gave specific cooking instructions for my husband, and if they had missed that out, they were most happy to redo the dish for us again.The food came with some misses although generally they were good. Someone complained the lobster bisque was too diluted and they offered to change for us, with no questions asked.Another person complained about the fish being too fishy, and again a change was made.We left the place with great and fond memories, and decided we will definitely be back again

There is no shortage of good Italian restaurants in Singapore ofwhich I hve di e in a few. As so being a purist in food culture, while trying to be open minded in fusion food such as Japanese-Italian or Japanese-French food, I tend to be more discerning given the comparables. Forlino is a fine restaurant that uses fresh ingredients but its more Japanese influenced that makes the menu akin to modern Japanese using Italian ingredients but lacking culture. E.g. one of the main dish in the set menu was Venison with risottto base. It turn out to be vension on a hash-brown looking risotto mixed with potato which had an extremely texture. Even the most basic pasta (lobster tomato) with slightly sweet tomato sauce pits at best in the league of 'Pasta Mania'! So overall it doesnt give the satisfaction that one had a great Italian meal - which typically hearty and full. Overall, its simply average
1
The service was slow and staff was unsure of menu. Food was awful, fish was overcooked and dessert was subpar
5
Good food, offers set lunch on weekdays. Great view of Marina Bay and MBS. Excellent for executive business luncheon.
5
We enjoy the view from the restaurant! It is beautiful at night. The root garden veg is very fresh, the carbonara pasta we had is awesome and the duet beef is the best of this meal!!
5
Lovely meal we had the carbonara and arriabiata which was cooked to perfection. Friendly staff and beautiful views of the marina and waterfall promenade.
2
Painfully slow service, even by Singapore standards. Semi-competent when they were able to find their way back to the table. Not unfriendly, just overmatched. Most of the food was tolerable, though overpriced. Nothing was exceptional. Bland risotto with blander sausage; foie gras 3 ways, well, one of the ways was tasty; best dish was the lamb, but the portion was two quite small chops. Not a bad looking room, but you can get a better view from many nearby places, even the Starbucks downstairs. Anyone who likes Italian food should skip this place. NOT worth it
4
Fantastic seating arranged for us by the staff of Forlino, Good service from the waiters on the ground, Delicious appetizers and dessert but was a little disappointed with the Black Cod fillet. The cod was really well done but the sauce did not go well with the cod in my opinion. The day ended off with a surprise birthday cake for my fiancee which made her really happy. In general, it was a really good experience at Forlino
5
I've been to Forlino a few time a few years ago and wasn't that impressed with the experience. It wasn't bad but nor was it memorable food. This time my dinning experience was excellent and I enjoyed the food and care from both the new Italian Manager Eugenio and the new MASTER CHEF Sasaki San. I had an amazing meal with my date with delicious wine and a night to remember. The food was interesting with a slight touch of Japanese flair but not over the top fusion. The potions were perfect which left room for a fabulous dessert. I strongly recommend giving it a try. It's new and improved and the service very good. The only recommendation I have for the management is to increase the temperature as it felt like 18 degrees, 22 would be nicer
2
Been there for dinner with three colleagues. Service was slow, arrogant and close to rudeness, also lacked professional knowledge (untrained?). The food is average, nothing special at all. You will eat it and forget what you had already 5 mins after the espresso. Even the presentation was boring and without love for detail. Prices are way too high for what you get
4
Met a few friends at Forlino's for a Prosecco free flow lunch. The initial feel of the place as I walked in was good, it looked very modern and clean. There was only about 30pc occupancy so dining room felt a bit empty. The view of Marina Bay was spectacular and if you want a place to take visitors the restaurant would be great at night.Food was a bit disappointing, not a lot of panache in the way it was presented and the sharing platters to start were a bit stingy although they were happy to bring another one for us all to share. Pasta 2nd course was again a bit boring and if you couldn't have cream or cheese you had to go without. They did kindly make a little pasta for my dairy intolerant friend which was nice. The "main" course of beef and I think it was chicken and fish was really disappointing. Tiny blobs of potato with one square of meat per person. No vegetables at all. I was really hungry after eating which is never a good thing. At $80++ pp it was good value and makes a change from the greedy "all you can eat" running buffets but I think the menu could be crafted more.I also did not like the way they cleared up around us, we were still at the table a little after 3 pm and whilst I understand they have an evening service to prepare for it did feel a bit rude when they ironed the new table cloths around us

just had a business lunch there and it was the first time there for me. It seemed rather small and intimate - or at least where we were seated - and had a great view of Marina Bay Area across the water. (Apparently, the restaurant had a larger section.)There were set lunch offerings, but each course had about 4 or 5 different options, from starters, mains to desserts. The food was okay. I had chestnut soup, which was very good, and grilled swordfish loin which was decent, but nothing to write home about. I topped it off with a mango sorbet pallet cleanser, which was very nice. All for the price of S$38++. My colleague, who was visiting Singapore and staying in a hotel on Orchard Road, commented that the price was lower than her breakfast.The service was efficient, though they got the orders of a couple of us switched around. No big deal.I may try it again for dinner. The night view must be spectacular

We were invited for dinner to celebrate a friends 50th birthday. The restaurant is difficult to find. The view from the restaurant is great. The food was very average but price wise it was expensive. The service was slow.

On personal verbal assurance from their staff regarding some promotion I was intending to use, I had brought some family to forlino to try out their food. Yet when I reached there, their policies had somehow changed and I was disallowed to use the promotion as they had previously assured me was usable. Instead of being apologetic about it, they had simply said, 'no, that is not possible'. The waitress in a blazer kept repeating, "I think she meant (so and so)" Does it really matter what your staff meant? You made it darn clear to me when I had previously come here that the promotion was ongoing. By calculations, I would have had to pay an additional $300 for a meal for 5. No apologies, no compromises for something that was the fault of your staff.Poor poor poor service, and not deserving of any rating whatsoever. I only put one star because it's impossible to go beyond that.Regarding food, the duck wrapped foie gras was total crap. The foie gras was too tough and the duck was too dry
4
Lunch sets are reasonably priced. We had a table overlooking the Merlion and river which made the dining experience even better. Quiet restaurant. No complaints abt the starter and mains choices - had my faves - foie gras, steak.. Couldn't tackle dessert afterwards. My friend enjoyed it so much that she booked a table for her wedding anniversary celebration. Can't wait to return to the restaurant
4
One of my friends treated me a sumptuous degustation menu. Three of us arrived about 9pm on Sunday. I like the restaurant for its view of the Bay and also Fullerton Hotel. All the other patrons left around 9.30-10pm so we had the place and services to ourselves after that.My favourite dishes were the scallops, pasta with sea urchin ("uni") and wagyu beef. The resident Japanese chef is good. Memorable night. The only thing I don't like is the cold bread
4
Stunning views of Singapore skyline, beautifully presented plates of well thought through Italian Cusine, great and attentive service staffs.All the above would be worth the dollars you are paying. $44+++ for weekend All You Can Eat buffet.They would serve sample bite size portions of everything on the menu. Everything looks pretty.Just a pity nothing stood out that would make you want to order seconds.The white tuna we had is interesting but not exceptional.
1
The food was fine. I am sure the chef is excellent, but the service completlely absent. We waited 20 minutes after being seated for even a glass of water. Each course took way more time to deliver than would be expected and there was no attention from the staff at all. Stay away from this place. It has rea problems
3
Went for the HSBC 1-for-1 offer for the chef's 7-course classic menu which includes bread and cheese, pan fried foie gras, spaghetti, main of either short rib or cod fish, white chocolate mousse and coffee/tea.Except for the coffee which is not bad, the rest are quite disappointing. The foie gras did not create the satisfaction that I always had with any pan fried foie gras. The spaghetti had a very slight fishy taste, enough to make me dislike this dish, and the cod fish was too 'dry', i.e. no trace of the cod fat/oil that will melt in the mouth. This is very different from most of the positive reviews I had read online about this restaurant.The ambience and view of the restaurant was very good though. Look out of the glass windows and you will see the beautiful night view at Marina Bay.The set menu costs $108 per pax before tax, and before the one-for-one. Overall, the food was ok, and I would say it is value for money if I pay around $60 for a 7-course meal. I will definitely not pay for it if there were no offer. $108++ will not be worthwhile to spend on such quality. I paid $254.23 for 4 people
4
The Italian food served here taste great and the night view of MBS from the restaurant was enjoyable. It was a dinner event that we attended here, the service of the staff was good too, even though there were so many tables of guests. Will be back together with husband for a romantic time together and will recommend to friends
5
We came here for the sunday prosecco brunch. All items on the menu were served once first and you can have seconds and thirds etc of what you like. Quality of food was fantastic, loved the fish and beef cheeks they were fine-dining standard. FOr the SGD78+ we paid for the prosecco option, it was great value for money. Attentive servers, view of the bay, great food, nothing more i could have asked for. Do make a reservation and request for a table by the windows to enjoy the view. Will definately come again

A classy Italian restaurant with everything to offer from panoramic views of the gorgeous Marina Bay area, excellent service and awesome food, hence for me it was a revisit. A table was reserved for us, by the ceiling-to-floor windows as promised, so that we could watch teh night slowly falling into beautiful forms.Our shared appetizer of Fegato Grasso (SGD$36.00) was served next - a dish consisting of hot and cold foie gras interestingly paired with pear compote, sambuca raisin, balsamic cream and homemade pannetone.The cold foie gras was rich in a buttery manner, and the flavor of game / innard was very strong when prepared this way, it resembled pate to say the least, with a rather distrinctive "raw" overture to it. I had to pair it with the crispy little pastry beneath it, alongside the tiny fruits used as decor, in order to mask the strong odor. Maybe we were just not used to it.Both of us agreed that the hot foie gras was a lot better - tender, even in its slightly jellyish state, and tasty with smokey hints that complemented the natural flavor of this dish.For the mains, the SIL took, at my recommendation, the Tortellini ai Cinque Formaggi (SGD$36.00) - 5 cheese tortellini with saffron cream sauce, kurobuta pork cheek, beetroot ouree and summer truffle. As usual, this sandy-textured pasta never failed to disappoint - smooth and rich in flavor. The pieces of tender black pork cheek enhanced the saltish flavor of the tiny little dumpling-shaped tortellini.I had the Merluzzo (SGD$42.00) - pan fried fillet of cod fish wrapped in parma proscuitto, baby cuttlefish in black ink, white polenta and zucchini flower. The cod was cod and springy in its juiciness; I thought the fine layer of prosciutto around it was rather interesting pairing with its texture and flavors play. The baby squids were a surprise - chewy but soft, and resplendent of the smoky black ink's taste.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dinner-at-forlinos-italian-restaurant.htm

Tried the executive set lunch and the pasta was very very well done. Not cheap but good value. Great view of the marina bay with good attentive service. This definitely means the dinner must be tried.
4
Had a wonderful evening at Forlino. The food was great albeit portions are a tad small. The view of MBS and Marina Bay was fantastic. Service staff were well trained and attentive. Definitely coming back

Booked a private room for my wedding. The staff ensured that the event went smoothly. Great services. Flexible in food options. We had kids as guest, and they were able to come out with a kids menu.

Fine dining for lunch is usually much cheaper than for dinner. So in order to save a few bucks, lunch dining is usually my preferred choice.Set in the heart of the CBD area is One Fullerton where there is a row of eateries to choose from. I chanced upon Forlino on a website while surfing for “atas” places to have a meal at. Upon being directed to the Forlino website, I noticed that there was a weekend buffet promotion and decided to find out more. It was my first time coming across a buffet dining at a fine dining restaurant so no harm trying. We made our reservations online via Chope and one of the staff will give a call to verify that you have made a reservation. Reservations may also be made through emailing them directly – email is found on the website. Request for a window seat facing the Marina Bay Sands, it will boost your dining experience. The entrance is a little conspicuous, and needs a little finding. Located on the 2nd floor, the entrance leads you one more floor up to the 3rd floor where you will be greeted by the waiters. We didn’t have to wait in the lounge for our table to be ready as we had made our reservations earlier on, and were shown to our seats. The menu changes every weekend, so when making reservations, ask them to send you a copy of the menu so that you know what to expect. They will serve you a round of the full course less the dessert which includes appetizer, secondi, main course. After the first round, you will then be able to request for more of any of the food which you have eaten. Our main course for the day was grilled sea bream and beef cheeks, which my partner and I adore. So we just kept ordering more and more of it. The waitresses are very friendly and don’t mind you ordering more of any of the courses – it is a buffet after all and they probably expect people to keep ordering what they like. The only downside for us was that the dining experience was a little blemished by a big group at another table. They were holding a birthday lunch, and in all big groups, they were rather noisy. Half the experience at a dining place like this is in the ambience, but it was rather ruined by the rest of the patrons.The price for a buffet here was really reasonable and for the amount we ate, I felt that it was quite worth the price. Service was reasonable, and like all fine dining establishments, the waitresses are attentive to all your needs. Overall 4.5 stars for me
4
Been here twice, once for lunch and the other for dinner. Set lunch was value for money, service was good and can get a good view of the surroundings (MBS etc). Dinner was more pricey but food was really good, had one of the best tiramisu. Night view is romantic, ambience is very good for a date or special occasion and the service was impeccable. One of my favourite Italian restaurants and am looking forward to visiting again.
4
Forlino has long been a favourite of mine for business lunches, thanks to its incomparable panoramic view of Marina Bay Sands and traditional Italian cuisine. There’s a great set menu with a variety of choice and you can see the F1 circuit from the restaurant- great for a car fanatic such as myself. It’s a brilliant place to bring friends or clients looking for a sophisticated lunch

Took my wife here for her anniversary. Food was excellent but very very expensive for what it was. Alcohol silly prices too. Only given a half decent table despite asking for a window seat as it was our special day.Staff initially gave us flat champagne - Not a good start. Only after we tasted did he notice as no bubbles in the glass. Even my 5 year old would have noticed that.Cut my finger on the door of Unisex Toilet handle and numerous flies in the toilet. Not a good sign for a supposed high end restaurant. 8/10 for me and wouldn't go back as been to far better eateries with nicer food and views
2
Visited the restaurant for their set lunch menu (2-course @ SGD 35++ & 3-course @ SDG 38++). Online menu showed a great selection of starter and main course. When I got there, the menu listed their starter, main course and dessert selection, however for certain items on their starter and main course, additional $$ is charge, if you go for a certain pasta or meat on the main course, you will have to top up SGD 8-10 on top of the 3-course meal pricing. That ain't right to my opinion. If you are looking for nice food, great value for money and not feel cheated by this way of marketing, visit other restaurants in Sg

Had the business set lunch this week, and the food was ok for the price. You can get better tasting food at Senso for about the same price. The foie gras was overcooked, the perch dish was tiny although the accompanying cous cous was quite flavoursome and the gelato and white choc dessert were good.But what stood out was the poor service. Smiles were missing from most of the wait staff from the time they greeted us at the entrance to the time they grudgingly served us the little pastries promised in the menu. Indeed we had to insist on getting the piccola pasticceria which the waitress kept insisting was coffee until we showed her a google image. She then said, "I'll ask my manager.' A while later, a plate of macaroons and biscotti was served with no apology and no explanation. We believe it is possible that the pastries had been accidentally included in the day's menu because the menu on the restaurant's website did not have it. That said, if a restaurant or shop had erroneously included something it should still offer that thing with grace. Contrast Forlino's attitude with those at Singapore's supermarkets - NTUC and Cold Storage - which when they have mispriced something still honour it with a smile and an apology. Surely Forlino could at least try to reach for the standard of service offered at these supermarkets. FORlino is supposed to be fine dining and it certainly should serve patrons as if it were a fine dining restaurant even when serving set lunches. The restaurant seems to have forgotten it was there FOR the customers and not to FROWN on their customers who leave with FROWNs on their faces

We've been going to the Forlino for the last few years, when it was under the Italian chef. We recently tried again, not knowing the ownership has changed hands. What a disappointment! We knew something was up when we saw a large, noisy group of Japanese men, wearing shorts and t-shirts. Dress code? The foccacia bread, which used to be mouthwatering, was so stale that I couldn't eat it. The lobster in the pasta was so overcooked that it was disintegrating. And whilst we used to go for the amazing view over the harbour, the new decor meant that due to the reflection of the bright restaurant lights and ugly curtains, that was all you could see when you looked out the window. What a disappointment. Apparently the Italian chef is at a new restaurant, which we will check out the next time we are in town.

We love the food and the ambience is so romantic. BUT they DON'T accept Brunei dollars. The waiter told us that his Manager said they don't accept Brunei dollars. I told him that Brunei Currency is the same rate as Singapore rate. I so wanted to tell him that shall I call MAS to reconfirm? I know it's not his fault, we do not want to create an issue so lucky that we have Singapore dollars with us, otherwise ... Anyway, we really enjoyed the food, wine and of course my date ;

I ate here twice at lunchtime. Once on a weekday and enjoyed it so much, I decided to return on a weekend. When I made the weekend reservation, I was told it was a weekend buffet brunch, which is fine. All of the food on the menu was brought out in succession; starters, pasta, then mains. This allows you to try everything before deciding if you wanted seconds (or thirds). We didn't touch seconds because we were so full! The food was delicious, very tasty and the chef substituted one of the dishes without us asking because of dietary restrictions. We had assumed that we just wouldn't get that dish, but were pleasantly surprised. The focaccia is amazing, the seafood pasta is delicious, and the chocolate tart is light and yummy. The restaurant has a nice view of the Merlion Park, Marina Bay, and Marina Bay Sands, and the decor is pleasant, comfortable, and inviting. Strongly recommended.

Six of us met here for a reunion on Saturday night. Excellent food and wine, very pleasant surroundings, great views and first class service from our waiter Frankie. Would have given maximum points if they had not started ironing the linen on the tables around us as we were waiting for our deserts at 10.00pm on a Saturday evening. We were the only people in the restaurant by this point and while it did not affect our enjoyment, it was disappointing that some of their staff appeared to care so little for their customers

The setting was perfect and Forlino was a great choice for New Years Eve. The letdown was the food. Trying to deliver gourmet food in the style of a wedding feast in a fine dining restaurant is very hard to do. The service and ambience made up for it and the food was secondary - an odd thing to say in such a high quality place as Forlino

what an experience, bravo to all, i was quite amazed by the quality of the food and the chef is not even Italian, is Japanese! Finally in Singapore a truly Italian fine dining, difficult to find as the majority of italian restaurant in this city are serving almost the same typical menu.Highly suggested to sophisticated Italian food lovers , tired of the same Spaghetti carbonara or fettuccine alla bolognese. High five to the service crew, lead by a great manager, very polite and attentive.Will be back for sure with more friend

It all started on the faithful F1 race night. We were invited to Forlino to watch the F1 race on the 25 Sep.When we all stepped in, we felt something was amiss. Alas, the room temperature was slightly higher than usual. We thought it must be the heat from the race and excitement. But as the night goes on and even before the race got started, the room temperature went even higher than the race track. Then the manager came apologizing that the air-con was malfunction and the reparation was in progress. It didn’t get better, it just got worse even after prestige guests started to leave the function (or malfunction) room.Basically, it was a nightmare and at the end of the day, we received a $100 voucher as an apology. But the nightmare didn’t end… We happily visited Forlino on the 26 Dec (which happens to be the last day the voucher was valid) and were disappointed to see that they have a private event that evening. Hence we looked for the manager to discuss if alternative arrangements can be made. The manager in charged, Lorenzo came out, immediately rejected us without even considering. And simply accused us of coming late because the voucher is valid for 3 months. It was simply bad customer service. He did not even bother to check if anything can be done. And he didn’t even realized that this voucher was issued because of a screw-up at Forlino’s end. His attitude was arrogant and we felt belittled as it seems like it is our fault that we came on the last available date. Sensing that nothing could be done, we left. But moments later, we checked the voucher and noticed that there wasn’t any terms indicating that we can’t utilized the voucher when Forlino has an event. We followed the terms in the voucher but got penalized and turned down because of an ill-mannered manager (Lorenzo). Hence we went back to speak to him and asked him how can we escalate this matter. When we asked for a contact whom we can escalate to, he felt offended and used a sarcastic phrase “oh, yes, I am not important”. On top of that, Lorenzo said that we have to make reservations to enjoy the usage of the voucher. At this point of time, we really think that it was impossible to communicate with him and he offered to call the COO. His conversation was in Italian and we could not understand what did he say but when he returned, we got the same answer. At the end of the day, it was another terrible experience. We think that Forlino has handled this situation very badly. We abide to the terms & conditions of the voucher but did not receive the $100 goodwill that Forlino has given. Never in the voucher was mentioned that we need to make reservations prior visiting Forlino and never in the voucher it was stated that we will not be able to use the voucher if there was a private event

We dined in the private Serena room overlooking the bay. Service was exceptional, food was spot-on Italian. Price, like anything in Singapore was expensive but worth it.As much as I enjoyed the wonderful rawness of the outdoor Hawker Centre downtown. It was good to get out of the humidity and enjoy a terrifc plate of pasta in the air conditioned luxury of Forlino. Enjoy

 Went with my girlfriend for our special day lately. We wish to thank all the staff in forlino restaurant for the excellent service and food! Direct view of marina bay sands and you will be mesmerized by the new ala carte menu. Tremendous effort by the chef. The food was amazing and couldnt ask for more. Staff were all very efficient and attentive. Need not have to waive my hands to call them despite the busy night they had. We were impressed by everything rendered to us. I have recommended all my friends and colleague for a lunch with their partners and gave me the same comment which was `excellent`! Felt proud about it as I am not a dining person. Well credit goes to you guys! Definitely we will be back with bigger groups! Im sure it will be an awesome place to host an event with Forlino!!

Went there recently for a colleague's farewell lunch. For all the hype, the food was underwhelming - not terrible but not worth the anticipation either. We had to keep waving to the service staff for water, olive oil for the bread, cracked pepper, coffee and the bill. There were plenty of staff but they all seemed to be rushing about doing nothing in particular. For a fine-dining restaurant, customers should not have to ask for olive oil or pepper when their food arrives; we should be asked instead having them scrurry away the second they plonk the plate down. Most were very cheerful & polite - when you got their attention - but one guy looked at me blankly when I asked if they had a DBS AMEX card promotion and said he would check and promptly forgot - wow

Hired the small private room for my mum's 70th birthday. The views over the bay are breathtaking and the room was very well decorated. A special venue indeed. Service was attentive but not particularly knowledgeable about the quite extensive wine menu. Drinks prices have a spectacular mark up (£30 retail in UK selling for £140) although granted I am not a local. We ordered the menu degustation which was 7 courses. Food quality was good but the cooking was simply not outstanding. Best of the lot was the wagyu beef which was very nice done
3
Had a corporate lunch at the restaurant.
Pros:
1) Great view
2) Nice decor
3) Good service
4) Quiet
Cons:
1) Hard to locate.
2) Food wasn't great
Great for couples and close friends.

Had a memorable evening at a friends birthday party. Terrific food - I think our hosts chose a superb set menu. Recommend the roast lamb in particular, it was amazing and one of the chocolate desserts was great.
Service was also very good.
4
A beautiful view of the bay with incredible homemade pasta. A bit pricey but to be expected with the location
3
The appetizer was excellent, but the main was a sore disappointment. The view and the service were excellent, but I would not want to go back. Over priced with food that was not good enough to justify the price.
4
I'm totally in love with the place; the bay view is amazing and the interior is very elegant and lux which you wot find very often in italian restaurants. The feeling you get is that you can unwind here while the busy world is bustling out there. Service was very good; the staffs were very attentive and knowledgable about their foods. Their menu is not very extensive, but you can request as you like.I ordered a tomato based angel hair, which was good. And the dessert and coffee was very nice. Bellissimo

I was there in group of three for lunch yesterday. Didn't opt for the lunch set which is about 38++ on weekdays but went for ala carte instead. Foie Gras, wine, seafood pasta, lamb steak and smoke salmon was ordered and the Foie gras was surprisingly good. Our seats were in the middle of no where so if you're entertaining a client or going for a special occasion I recommend specifying window side seats when reserving a table. Service was good, staff was welcoming and pleasant but for $300, id expect a less obstructed view. I will go back for the private setting though

singapore has wide range of options to eat. It seems that Forlino is not one of them. The menue pretends to be Italien but the result is very average food with a very little resenblance to the original. On top of it prices are high for this kind of food, and the view to the bay is limited. To sum up go there only if you have to entertain local customer in an expensive restaurant
5
I have recently been to this very elegant italian restaurant. First of all the location : unique ! Directly above the Merlion, Singapore's symbol and right in front of Marina Bay Sands. The ambiance is refined in classical (upmarket) italian style. I', Italian, living in Italy, so I know what to expect from an italian restaurant : in this one they serve a "revisited italian" cuisine with many ingredients coming directly from Italy. Some dishes were original and simply outstanding and the caramel lava signature dessert (to die for) ended a really perfect meal. Last but not least the service : prompt and very kind.I higly recommend ! Prices are correct and in line to Singapore's fine dining restaurants

Me and wife has been patronizing Forlino since 2 years back. Since it was our anniversary day and wanted to have Italian cuisine, Forlino strikes back in mind. So we went to Forlino and was truly amazed at how the restaurant dining area has changed from previously 'dark' to more brighter and more elegant! We were greeted warmly and the staff were amazing! No words could describe my dining experience and my wife told me that was the most memorable anniversary date she had with me after 6 years of marriage!! Forlino, you guys made it happened! The Chef present us the surprise anniversary cake with 'happy anniversary' written on the plate which adds more to the dining experience. Food was fantastic, full flavour, generous portion and very satisfying. There was a family with 3 kids seated next to our table who celebrated their kids birthday and the staff were singing birthday songs to the birthday kid and I wonder which restaurant will go to this extend when they are busy. It is an awesome evening. Will definitely come back! I wish Forlino exist during my wedding so that I could hold my wedding reception there! Great place to hold weddings and function too. Totally in love with the view 'it brings up the romance', the food and the service! GREAT! Me and wife would like to extend thousands of BIG THANK YOU to you guys for doing such a great job and going to the extra miles to make your patrons leave happily! WELL DONE

Food was nice, but this is not a restaurant that welcomes families. We dined one early evening with our 2 and 6 year old. When we arrived, we had a luke warm reception. Immediately I got the feeling that kids were not really welcomed, when they sat us in a far corner, far away from everyone else. Though our waitress was very lovely and attentive, our dinner was soon spoilt by the French waiter who abruptly came over to tell us that our children could not be "walking around disturbing other dinners" when in reality they were both just walking over to the window to get a closer look at the light show at MBS. In a place like Singapore, where there are plenty of other options, I doubt I will be coming back with or without my children
5
The entrance was a bit strange considering that it is in a relatively recent building. That said, the setting and view is fabulous. The food is divine. The service flawless. Recommended.
5
The food was top notch and the service impecable. Glad I wasn't paying though.
The wait staff are knowledgable and frielndly without being too much. Really enjoyed the meal. 11 at a table can be tough on staff but they handled it very well.
3
Finally tried Forlinos during restaurant week. It felt tired and food was competent although nothing earth- shattering. I would pick Mozza or Oso, heck even Gattopardo, over this any day.
2
For anyone who knows and likes Italian food this just doesn't rate!Supercilious Maitre D and over stated dishes. Pasta undercooked (not just al dente) and a risotto that was uneatable the rice was so uncooked were only part of the story. Perhaps it was chef's night off, but they need a very good excuse to justify the prices.Saved only by super view and our choice of a good wine
3
When I mentioned to my wife that I was going with some colleagues to Forlino she said that I would like it.The restaurant is nice and the setting pleasant too but the view of MBS is blocked so that was a let down. The staff were very attentive and kind and we returned a bottle of wine without any fuss. We had the set lunch which looked like good value for money. We had a smoked salmon starter which was way too salty. I think that the kitchen ground some rock salt over the underlying salad so I could barely taste the fish.The second course was a pork ball and ricotta lasagne which came in a cute pot. That was very nice but found it odd that they put an egg at the bottom of the lasagne.For the mains I had turkey and my colleagues had fish. My turkey was too dry and the fish too fishy.For dessert we had grenache chocolate in between two slices of panettone. That looked nice but the panettone should not have had any lemon in it and the fruit on the plate didn't really work for me.I agree with another reviewer that they pushed two bottles of water on us. No one really commented on it but they should have asked, especially at $9.00 each!The meal we had can be vastly improved but at $68.00 per head overall was good value.I would give it one more try and some people rave about it but it would only be one more

I went for dinner to Forlino a few days ago with two good friends of mine, one french and the other one local singaporean, since i knew that they are used to the Haute Cuisine of Paris wich is their home base for six month a year and beeing myself an italian food lover recently moved to Sing, i looked around for a restaurant that could be the wright place for them in terms of good an attemptive service and well researched food without spending a fortune. My experience over-all was just amazing and beyond my expectation, thanks to the hostess we got our beautiful table on the mbs side wich felt like being on the shore of the bay with the view of Merlion off course in a very elegant atmosphere.Once seated at the table from the Italian Manager we ordered a Singapore Sling (probably the best i've ever tried in my life) wich was made in less then 2 minutes from the bar tender and served with a selection of three different kind of breadstick, while having the cocktail we looked at the menu and i realized immediately that this was the place i was looking for.To pick only two or three dishes from selection on the A la carte menu was too difficult cause everything sounds too good to me and my friend so we decided to go for their degustation menu, a six/seven course tasting menu that gives you the opportunity to try many dishes.The food starting from the freshly baked Focaccia and Bread-stik was very good and the timing beetween each course was managed attemptively by the person in charge of our table. The Sommelier picked for us a bottle of Trebbiano (very similar to the Sauvignon Blanc) that we had with the first three servings and a bottle of Supertuscan red (can't recall the name) which was just great with the homemade tagliatelle with duck ragout followed by a maincourse of a perfectly cooked beef.The dessert was exactly what you really need after a six course menu, a mojito cocktail revised and made as a dessert with a very fresh lime sorbet that clean your mouth.The service staff was accomodating with a wide and friendly smile all the request we made that's why i'm looking forward to go back soon and try all the rest of the dishes that weren't in the degustation menu of this restaurant, which is so far the best i've tried in Singapore.LOVE IT!!

We had a most memorable dinner here last weekend during the F1. Forlino's enviable location on the 2nd floor of One Fullerton gives patrons panoramic views of Marina Bay and the New Downtown. It also overlooks Turn 13 on the F1 circuit making it an excellent vantage point to follow the race. Unlike 99% of commercial outlets surrounding the Marina Bay circuit, Forlino's didn't jack up their prices or put together an astronomical 'F1 package'. It was just business as usual. They even waived corkage on a magnum bottle of 2005 Margaux that I brought along. The ambiance in the restaurant is really quite amazing - more so during the F1 with cars zipping by just 50m away!The food was excellent too - a fusion of Italian & French. Service was impeccable.All in all a 12 out of 10 night, and we'll be back for next years race if not before

The restaurant is in the very heart Of Marina Bay Sands. Very close to all central hotels, so you can have a pleasant walk to and from the restaurant (if it's not to hot) around marina. The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated and very well organized with different areas. The style resembles very much the style of posh old school European restaurants. You'll definitely have a feeling of sitting in an expensive place and regret that you don't have a jacket and good shoes (if you lack them as it was in our case). However, all the servants are very friendly and not officious at all. It's very funny as they try to speak Italian. The food is good, and for Singapore it's even excellent. Gnocchi are delightful and it's usually a very hard test for any foreign Italian restaurant to prepare good gnocchi (as well as risotto). Even in Italy it's not easy to find such gnocchi! The wine list is extensive with some rare Italians. Overall in terms of location, cusine, ambience, distance to a hotel - it's No.1 for us in Singapore. And it's not very expensive as it may seem when your enter it for the first time. Very goon choice
3
We took about 3 hours to complete our "degustation menu". My eyes can barely open after the dinner finally finished at 10pm+ on a weekday. The dim lighting makes it difficult to examine the food. I liked the lobster salad, the meat is very sweet and succulent. Yummy! The slice of pan fried goose liver is pathetically small :( The tortelli is nice, but each portion only has 2 pieces of tortelli on a huge serving plate. The black cod is really so-so, nothing fanstastic about it. The Wagyu beef cheek is delicious, very tender and well-seasoned. Our molten chocolate dessert is good. All the courses came on a huge serving plate, with tiny portion of food. Fine dining~~ Argh, not something that I would prefer to do so often.

This is a seriously difficult restaurant to navigate your way to/through. On saying that on arrival the decor here alluded to a genuinely interesting restaurant - until you walk into the main dining area. The views of Marina Bay are wonderful I admit but the rest of the interiors look very ordinary and not at all chic as I guess was the designers intention. Food was tasty, wine list adequate for such a restaurant but the service was annoying. As we dined quite late ( due to the arrival of our flight into Singapore) we found the staff clearing tables around us, ironing table clothes and generally making it known that it was time for us all to go home. I stay ALL as there where three other tables still enjoying their evenings whilst all the cleaning activities took place. Not very professional in my mind. Overall an OK restaurant in a town full of much better choices. Great views, disappointing ambiance and food was good but not memorable
3
recommended by hotel concierge and the view of the Marina Bay light show was spectacular. food was not memorable.
3
The restaurant was difficult to find, many corridors and turns. Dining room full of light with nice views. Food looked sophiticated but taste was just OK. The kind of restaurant that pretends to be in and priced accordingly...but it isn't.
5
Fantastic view of the SIngapore river, great food, excellent service. It's a perfect place to impress that first date
5
Great view, great service, wonderful food. I will go again and again and again (as soon as I get the money!)

Had the degustation menu. Wasn't impressed. Money could be better spent elsewhere.

When I turned up to this restaurant as an invited guest as part of a client thank you dinner it was full of promise. Great dÃ©cor and views, seemingly good atmosphere and efficient waiter service of wine and cocktails while we waited. Although it took them 10 minutes to get me a San Pellegrino.From that point on the evening descended into a very average restaurant experience.To be fair - what I had of the food was alright. Fish tartare appetizer and amuse bouche were fine nothing special and no better than I've had at any other Italian restaurants, but not bad.Unfortunately, neither I nor the rest of my party were served any oil or butter with the bread The main courses black cod and beef were okay. desert was unoriginal and so-so.Those who drank wine were kept well supplied in alcohol. Unfortunately the staff seemed out of their depth, poorly organised and, quite frankly, badly managed. Portions were small and I was still hungry after the four course menu so if you find yourself hungry and in the area, I suggest you go to other across the street to the Fullerton Hotel !My ratings are based on what food I did have. Service, atmosphere and value for money cover the whole evening
3
Been to Forlino since it's opening a few years back. For those who like Italian food the French way it may be just right but I would always expect Italian food to be as close to the natural state of the ingredients as possible. Prices are outrageous for what you get. Food quality is surely top notch but the service is below average and sorry the interior is just boring. The view however makes up for most of that. Bring a big walle

First of the get to the restaurant is more like a maze of alleys in a tube station and not inviting at all. The decor and atmosphere in the place is more like an after thought than a nice romantic entrance and setting, it really feels like an annex to something that has past it's best by a long time. The service was poor and depended on just a couple of staff working hard but well pushed. The food was actually very good and the views where good also. Overall for setting and service it only warrants a

Forlino is an Italian restaurant situation in the Marina Bay area. It is next to the Merlion fountain, and the view includes the Singapore Flyer lit up at night and Marina Bay Sands, which spews out a laser light show every hour when it gets dark. The view is magnificent, and most of the "over-priced" comments probably is to pay for this, the view.The decor and service are also to be commended. Our large party got our own private room. Three waiters and waitresses attended to us dutifully. When one lady could not eat the Foie Gras, an observant waiter quickly replaced it with a crab salad before anyone could utter a suggestion. The atmosphere was top-notch.The downside, however, was that the main course was the biggest let down of the night. Our rack of lambs turned out a tad bit dry and course. But the Cheese mousse puff appetizer, Foie gras and peach, Mushroom penne and Cheese trifle dessert were absolutely delicious. The chef did also come out to give us his regards, which makes me feel a little bad about dissing the main course. Plus, as others have pointed out, it is pricey. Well, we were there for a special occasion so it turned out just right. I would go again given another special occasion
4
Very good food with good service although a little too much attention especially when going to the washroom which is quite a distance away. On the way, back there would be at least 4 to 5 wait staff saying Welcome Back!Wines are way expensive but the overall experience was worth it :
5
one night a very pleasant, quiet atmosphere, breathtaking views, but what we liked most is undoubtedly the food, but I will not say more, I leave you the surprise to discover a authentic cooking style, purely Italian.
3
My husband and I selected this Italian Fine dining place in Singapore for our anniversary dinner. We liked the Terrine and the Pumpkin Soup, not to mention the delicious spanich ravioli, however the most basic pasta (Spaghetti in Arabiatta sauce with some mixed veggies) was highly disappointing. Not recommended if you are a vegetarian. Very few options and they charge you extra if they tweak the existing dishes to suit your pallate. Barring one fine gentleman who greeted us with a smile, I found the staff lacking pleasant demeanour
3
Have gone once, with a group of 12. Our food was good to very good. Our group of 12 did the set menu, and the spaghetti chitarra, roasted quail, molten chocolate cake and other dishes were all well-prepared. But there was something about the night that made it less than luxe dining. Something that just made it seem a bit awkward and not as smooth/flawless as one would expect at a place like this. During one funny moment, I was perusing the wine list and quietly commented to a friend that several of the bottles are cheap Italian wine one can pick up at a wine store or market for under $30; of course restaurant wine mark up is common and expected, but table chianti were marked up to more than $200. What was funny is the server must have seen us point and he commented, “Oh, yes. Some of these wines are not that good. We make them expensive so our guests don’t order them.” ?? And we were bemused when he first handed us the wine list and immediately turned to the brunello page (which is one of the most expensive / highest quality Italian wines … very good but not something one typically orders on an average night out) … we said, “Thanks .. but don’t think we’ll be ordering any brunello tonight…”Most frustrating -- If you’re going to have an upscale Italian restaurant, it might be better to not locate it above a popular teeny-bopper dance club; all through dinner, we could hear – loudly – the music from the club thumping through the floor of the restaurant under us. And, the restaurant doesn’t have its own bathrooms but rather shares bathrooms WITH said club downstairs … so our toilet trips were accompanied by throngs of girls throwing up in the stalls and masses of people waiting to get in the club. Not exactly a positive dining experience. In the end, we paid about $200 pp and while it was fine, it wasn’t worth that so we wouldn’t go back
4
I have been visiting this Restaurant with my friends and we enjoyed a wonderful evening. The food was the best Italian I have ever had and the Atmosphare is just fantastic. The service is friendly and quick on the uptake without being officious. All in all, Forlino is definitely worth a visit
4
If you are looking for very good gourmet Italian food with wonderfully attention service staff, then Forlino is the place to go. In terms of the view of the Singapore waterfront, you really couldn't do much better. Right next to the iconic Merlion and between the iconic Fullerton hotel and Marina Bay Sands on the other side of the waterway, the view is fantastic. It would be even better on a Formula One race day as the view is fantastic. But that probably requires really early reservation. And the food is really good too
5
Elly and her service team should be commended for making my family's night out at Forlino's on 13 December 2010 a wonderful experience. I had thought of fine dining to celebrate my son's 3rd birthday, and it was a pleasant surprise that Forlino's agreed to the challenge. We went on HSBC's dining promotion,and thoroughly enjoyed the degustation menu, from the crispy focaccia, through the seared scallop, tagliatelle with duck confit (Elliot's favourite), petits fours, to the chocolate birthday cake for my son. Service throughout was thoroughly impeccable and well-informed, as one would expect of a top restaurant, but unexpectedly also very warm and friendly. Thank you so much, and kudos once again to your Elly
5
The best in a long timeI’d never been to Forlinos but have sampled Chef Mario’s wares before in Thailand now Singapore and as before he did not disappoint.My starter appetiser, Prosciutto e Burrata Burrata cheese (like a very creamy Mozzarella) Prosciutto (Italian Parma Ham) with oven baked Leek. An excellent formulation and execution.Main, Guance di BueGuance di Bue, I was taught to stew Ox cheek with Rosemary Bay leaf and Juniper berries but Chef Mario braised his Wagyu beef, with my old favourite chocolate and red wine sauce it got me again. Bellisimo

I traveled to Singapore to try Forlino’s cuisine which is now made by the renowned chef Mario Caramella, who has been a prophet of top quality and authentic Italian Cuisine in Asia. I have tried his Classic Menu, in which he have included some of the most popular dishes of his repertoire. Chef Caramella´s Lobster spaghetti chitarra for example is a timeless dish, impeccably prepared, simple yet delicious, built at the same time on the quality of the ingredients as well as the ability of the chef. In other words: the true essence of Italian Cuisine. Both tuna couscous and Roasted quails were excellent, as well: 2 clear examples of how Italian cuisine, in the hands of a capable and knowledgeable chef can be taken at the heights of superb Fine Dining. The service was efficient, in line with the elegance of the place. Not to mention the location: unsurpassable in Singapore. But I went to enjoy the food (great Wine List, by the way) and, indeed, I did

Finally get to dine at Forlino with my family last week!It is aww-so-wonderful Italian dining experience that I had to share it here!The great dishes we ordered:Ocean trout tartare,spanner crab with tuscan bread - appetizersSpaghetti 'alla chitarra' with lobsterSlow roasted pork flankRoasted quail with goose liverRicotta cheese trifle with pistachio cream and coffee granitaI particularly love how the spaghetti tasted so fresh and tangy! Chef Mario even came out to greet us and told us that the spaghetti is actually freshly handmade every day, what an effort! Overall, it was a really sumptuous feast that delivers authentic Italian flavours with a modern twist, and the seat we got has the most spectacular view of the Marina Bay Sands! I will definitely come back again for more Italian treats :
5
Great atmosphere, the view from the restaurant is fantastic.The service is personall and attentive.The quality of the food is outstanding, flavorsame and top engredients are used.Chef Mario is a real caracter, outstanding chef with a lot of experience in Asia and brings the best of italian food in Singapore
5
Food incredibly good, service impeccable and beatiful location.
We ate burrata chese and risotto, and it was absolutely delicious...authentic italian food and first quality!
5
I've been visiting Il Forlino for two business dinners last month and I found this restaurant to be just outstanding.The food is really Italian with a a modern twist, chef Mario cooks witha solid Italian foundation, and is also up to speed with the new techniques, in other words is authentic, yet elegant and contemporary as well.The service was just excellent we were taken care very well by the staff which were discreet and allowed us to talk business without any interruptions, the wines offered by the sommelier were just right, very good, not the "usual suspects" and yet fairly priced.My guests were impressed as well and they mentioned recently how much they enjoyed their dining experience at Il Forlino, they will make sure to return when they'll come back to Singapore.Well done to Il Forlino!
5
If you want to experience the real Italian food this is the best place in town.Yes the view is fantastic and the service perfect but the food of chef Mario is the protagonist . My friend and me we past a wonderful night and the food was exactly like we was in italy.We recommend to all

Been to Forlino last week with a colleague of mine, one of those lets go girlfriend and have fun.Rolled in without a reservation on a Wednesday we figure that surely they may have a table for two...wrong ...the place was packed but we were not sent away; instead Chef Mario himself came to greet us and offered a glass of prosecco while he invited us to wait at the bar till a table became available.It did not take long since it was close to 9 pm and while we were waiting chef Mario appeared with some very yummy savory bigne and truffle meatball just to keep us amused, nice touch.Table ready and we get into the restaurant, it seem is quite stark in contrast with the amazing view of the marina lights, but once seated it become cozy and we relaxed immediately.A nice bottle of wine in and here it comes the appetizers, the crab panzanella was nice and refreshing, simple yet very satisfying, My colleague artichoke salad was fresh, crunch with the natural iron taste of the artichoke nicely offset from the simple vinaigrette, simplicity at its best, mains: let meat it out for change so I had the quail...it was beautiful, not a bone, nicely roasted, great sauce again simple but so tasty I had the Secreto of pig, a particular part of the pork back ( or so Chef Mario Explained ) was melting in your mouth with a crunch to it .the peaches on the side and mulled wine sauce to compliment .. it was that good that no word was exchanged a part for a mutual agreement to just share it all.Dessert was not in the card , too many calories so we skipped and move on to a limoncello which was served with some sort of sweet crisp fritters called chiacchere...addictive.....way to addictive.... so much for not ordering dessert ...Very good experience, not cheap but you get what you pay for , I will definitely be bac

This restaurant could be great. Service is some of the best I have had in Singapore. The food was good, but considering price not exceptional. The restaurant atmosphere did not work for me. It is not intimate, not a place to in with friends, it just made me feel awkward. Don't let this put you off, this place is worth a try

I ate here with a colleague in August 2011 on a Thursday evening. My colleague, a local, had never been there but heard good things. I was left disappointed based on the expectations she established. We had the "Chef Mario's Classics" set menu for 108. It was a hit and miss meal. Like usual, the Good, OK, and Ugly.....The Good- We were the first table seated and met the chef in the hallway into the restaurant (likely Mario?) upon arrival to a warm greeting. Unexpected nice touch.- The view is real nice. It's unobstructed of the Singapore skyline and bay towards the MBS.- The decor was real nice. The hallway leading into the dining room is an egg-shell blue trimmed with silver - well done.The OK- The food overall.....the blue fin tuna appetizer (very small piece) was real nice. As was the quail stuffed with foie gras. Each of these were delicious and well done. BUT...the spaghetti with lobster was not good. First, the pasta was so salty I could not eat it. I don't mind some salt, but it was horribly over-salted. The lobster was nice, albeit a quite small sliver. Potentially the best course was the dessert - a chocolate cake.- The service. Like the food, this was hit or miss. Our drink orders were taken immediately and each course came with a brief overview which was interesting and appreciated. However, when the waitress approached after the lobster course and saw my serving intact, she asked if there was an issue. I responded about too much salt for my taste. She nodded and did nothing. Management team - if your wait staff cannot make amends for issues at the table - do not have them ask. I assumed (wrongly) she may have offered an alternative - but nothing came.- The price with drinks was almost 300SD. Overpriced in my opinion and many better restaurants to be had. I'd been happier with having paid 75ish for the set menu....The Bad- Nothing.Maybe I should have ordered ala carte........again the setting and the view was nice. I just didn't like some of the food. Would I try again? Maybe, after I try the long list of other Singapore haunts I've been meaning to get to....Jerem

Celebrating my birthday at Forlino was one of the unforgettable moments of my life.Something I would rave about to all my friends are the picturesque view of the majestic Marina Bay Sands. The windows at the Forlino in the dining area are stretch from floor to ceiling such that you can't stand looking out to submerged in the overwhelming Singapore city scape! Felt like a totally Queen with that expensive view right in front of me!Cuisine wise, the presentation is good. My first time eating ravioli and risotto and I fell in love with them. My pals were crazy over the pan roasted goose liver but I am not really a fan of anything goose. And if you love chocolate souffle, please do try their molten lava chocolate cake with banana and rum sauce! So good! All in all, my experience there was worth it for the money I paid and I will definitely return

I wished i had something to write about the food ( UOB promotion ). Within the last 1 mth, we made 3 reservations and each time we confirmed that the promotion was valid. The day before the dinner we receive a call and informed us that its not. We made another reservation , confirmed promotion and againthey cancelled the dinner 1 day before. This happen 3 times and i finally blasted the 3rd caller from the restaurant. I have not even tasted the food yet but with services like these, i dont think i need to waste my time. I got alot more choices and Forlino will never again appear in my restaurant list

I can't review this restaurant, in truth. Because I never got in. I made a reservation for my wedding anniversary. Then, a couple of days later, they cancelled it. They said that the restaurant was being booked for an event.I don't know if this is standard industry practice, but I was severely let down. I will never visit this restaurant, and I would like to warn everybody out there that even if you make a reservation with this place, they may not keep it. It's the truth - they did this to me

We choose Folino for our final dinner in Singapore before leaving for Hong Kong. We weren't disappointed. We we seated at a table next to the window on the Marina Bay side of the restaurant. Great view of the light and water show at the Marina Bay Sands. Food was very good and the service was great. Not fast but we really weren't in any hurry. Expensive but so is everything else in Singapore.
