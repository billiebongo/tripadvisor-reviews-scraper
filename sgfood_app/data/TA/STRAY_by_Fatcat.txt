Good food, small portion though. Expensive but worth to at least try once. Food presentations is extremely pretty. Nice cafe ambience. Good service.

Just finished dinner with my friends at stray. The restaurant was not very crowded and conducive for gathering or couple. I ordered short rib pot rice, salted egg chicken, and salted egg calamari. The food was good, especially the calamari. The taste was good and presentation was nice. A nice dinner

Interesting twist on some traditional dishes. But the menu is too short, the atmosphere too casual (tables set in a corridor of a mall!), and the dishes not good enough for people to go back on return visits. Of the dishes we tried at lunch, only the salmon Yu sheng bowl was good. The rendang carrot cake and the wagyu beef bowl were interesting, but too rich that one must struggle to finish the small serving.

Came here on recommendation of a friend.Had the spam fries, jellyfish, Black pepper beef rice, chicken cutlet waffle and keep popping spheres.Presentation is excellent. Would not be out of place in a Michelin restaurant. Food wise flavors were well harmonized. The pink ginger foam goes splendidly with the beef. Canâ€™t go wrong salted egg with chicken cutlet. The jellyfish is splendid too.Overall the quality is excellent.Price is very reasonable given the quality.Highly recommended

Unpretentious open restaurant on the 4th floor of Orchard Central with an interesting limited menu of fusion Chinese food. We enjoyed the spam fries and the black pepper wagyu bowl with an onsen egg. The paper wrap chicken was done with Chinese herbs and would appeal to some who like this. The wagyu short rib claypot rice was not served in a claypot but the rice was tasty and the thin slices of meat were tender. Though the food was tasty, the servings were small and the price expensive. After the meal, we moved off for a second lunch in a nearby Japanese restaurant. We liked the dessert mysteriously called Commando's Favourite - Very refreshing lychee sorbet with an assortment of toppings. Black and Gold is a charcoal waffle with salted egg ice cream - Again, rather eclectic and even the salted egg lovers in our group were divided whether they liked it or not..

Interesting salted egg soft serve ice cream and charcoal waffles. The dessert was nicely presented (this is called Black and Gold - $18). The soft serve tasted ok with a tinge of salted egg flavour. The waffles tasted normal though I found it a tad dry. You add $2 for salted egg sauce. Overall interesting dessert but I found it too pricey. The restaurant served food and other dishes as well but I didn't have a chance to try them that day.
