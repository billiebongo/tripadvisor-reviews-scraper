Seafood were fresh and refilling were fast from the staff. Chicken were a bit salty to our likening. Slight improvement to be make were the ants. Too many crawling around our table and rushing into our soft drinks. And we end up keep changing our drinks. Till the end we solved the problem by putting our drinks on our plate and fill the plate with water.
