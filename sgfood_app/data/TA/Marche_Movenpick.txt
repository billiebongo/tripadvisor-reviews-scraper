The overall experience given by the staff was disappointing. Every request from us such as getting water refilled was always turned to deaf ears.
If you want good food with good staff, this is not the place for you.
2
We popped in for breakfast and had a pretty ordinary meal. Breakfast was delivered with no cutlery, toast was dry with no butter or preserves and coffee was disappointing. The espresso had no creama and latte was uninspiring. When we asked for a bit of water the waiter rolled his eyes and to no one's surprise we did not get any water. Maybe it was an off day but it was disappointing.

The restaurant is in the center at a fairly busy intersection, but that does not bother you. During our visit it was raining, and despite the fact that the place is open and is practically outside, it does not matter. It was very nice, the service works very well, the roofing works and the tables were dry. Who wants to maybe sit down deeper, closer to the bar and the kitchen. We only went for a beer and a coke. I ordered a large beer, but I did not expect such a mug! It was the best beer I drank in Singapore! Price does not matter..

Great spot on the corner outside Raffles city. Itâ€™s got an indoor and outdoor seating area. Nice and clean and comfy chairs and higher seating too. WiFi available and servers friendly. Choices of teas etc and served in lovely tall glasses. Breakfast options very good and the bread sourdough was lovely. Reasonable prices too
1
2 pm and and not eaten since dinner I was absolutely starving .It was a case of it is here letâ€™s give it ago We found the menu very limited and we should have left .We ordered the crepes one chicken one ham Tasteless and the side salad smelt fecal . Needless to say as I write this review I am still hungry as I could not eat it YU
3
the resto didnt live up to standard! expensive and the food is a disappointment. the place need some improvement as well. i dont like the chefs talking while cooking. who knows saliva has been flying all over the food!
5
What I really like about this place is that it is in open air. They have a terrace, sheltered from the sun and the rest of the restaurant is wide open. So no airco but real air. They serve great snacks, pizza, burgers and more elaborate dishes that all look really great. As a veggie there are also good choices for me. Staff is always very friendly, helpful and efficient. I like the informal decoration. Always a great place for a quick snack, drink or even a substantial lunch, be it solo, for business, family or informal.

I was in Singapore for business and always try something different. I read the reviews of Marche on TripAdvisor and always had people seated when I have walked past.I think it struggle to develop a following with Brotzeit being on one side but I can say I the experience was good. The food was a large portion ( pasta option where you make it up off the menu ) The pasta was well cooked and the overall dish was excellent.The beer was cold and my only issue was there was very few options on the beer side of things.Overall a good experience and I will eat there again
4
Marche Movenpick assumes prime position, directly opposite Raffles Hotel at the corner entrance to Raffles City. Whilst the menu is varied, one gets the impression that as they are so potentially busy, that you can take it or leave it, which is not customer friendly, or what one expects to experience
4
On walking back to our hotel we decided to stop off for coffee as we had eaten 2 hours previously,first impressions poor when server did say it was reluctantly ok.another couple came after us and said they just wanted lattes but she said they didn't serve them and left.we our waitress came Sandy completely different ,brought our coffees with a smile and checked everything was alright and when my wife asked Ramesh for some extra hot water it was brought immediately with a smile.good coffee by the way
5
Our dinner here was excellent the staff were friendly and attentive, and the food was excellent. Not a bad Singapore sling either. Well priced definitely worth a visit
4
I had a Singapore sling here and it was on average (for sure not the best one I had in Singapore)!! The service was ok.
5
Right opposite our hotel this is a great little place for meals - especially the hand made pizzas. They also make the best cup of coffee I had in Singapore, even though it was a small cup! Attentive but not intrusive staff and spotlessly clean.
4
Visited for lunch. Good location in Raffles city mall but outside at street level. Large open area with lots of seating choices
Service good as our the menu choices. Good drinks choice
I had a salmon sandwich that was good
Some specials and well priced
4
Great food, excellent service. Everything consistent, well priced. Restaurant overlooks an open street so there is a permanent breeze. Will definitely be back.
5
Rhoda - 6 stars service. Good to see familiar face after a long absence.
Compliments to the Chef and team for the very delicious margarita pizza, salad and mixed berries crepes for dessert - out of this world ðŸ˜‹

I love the Marche restaurants in General. But today for dinner I tried the Raffles Place Marche Restaurant and was left totally annoyed. The food was good. The service was good but the experienced left us frustrated, angry and exasperated. We were there for an evening and right from the start there was a group of 5 to 6 people occupying a table in front of us. All the members on this table were using flashy camera's with powerful flashes. After an hour of enduring this and my Nephew who suffers with migraines feeling the flash photography causing it, I politely asked the party to please stop using the flash. Other patrons were also disturbed by the constant barrage of flashes especially because the restaurant is quite dark. However they continued with their behaviour with no regard to others around them. Eventually we had to get off the table as my Nephew had a full on Migraine. Whilst they waited outside I went to the pay counter to pay. I discussed the matter with the waitress who advised me that the photography party were a group blogging the restaurants food. It was an awefull evening trying to help my Nephew. I won't be visiting this restaurant for their disregard to their paying customers

The pork chop i ordered was hard and almost imposible to chew, when i complain it to the waiter, they said it is like this their pork cho

So Iâ€™ve given an extra star just for the amazing location.. the food is average.. pizza was ok.. pasta was decent.. garlic bread is a joke.. overall very average food.. whatâ€™s amazing is the location.. itâ€™s got a good vibe to it. So if youâ€™re looking for a place to relax and have a good time then this is it.. but if u want good food.. I suggest you find another place
1
Been here 10 days and worst meal of all chicken was fatty grissly and not pleasant at allSalad was warm prawns over cooked And had to fight for a bill reduction Wonâ€™t be back, plenty of others to choose in Singapore
4
Kind staff, nice place, good choice of meals
Pizza are really good
Salad was perfect
All ingredients are fresh
and of course the ice cream is great :)
5
Perfect interesting and very comfortable place.
Food has very well taste.
I came along and they gave me best table that usually 4 people sitting. Staff best!
5
This restaurant is just the right place with fresh food cooked in front you. Everything is great and very delicious pasta, pizza, meat and see food. The restaurant is built in Swiss style and it has very interesting interior.
5
Recently staying across the road at the Carlton we had breakfast here a couple of times.. Great value if your looking for a quick bite and coffee to kick start your day .
4
love coming here as they never disappoint, great range of foods, duck gourmet pizza is amazing, lovely wines, very fast and attentive service, nice location, what more could you want?
2
At the conclusion of the Singapore Grand Prix and on our way back to our hotel found surprisingly not the many places open at least for food Opposite Raffles this place looked abiding and welcoming A Movenpick franchise it's my first visit Though the staff were very service oriented the food proved much less. Order an entree of Nachos with Guacamole What arrived was a concoction of corn chips most likely packaged aka supermarket variety No melted cheese and not hot The Guacamole was anything but I couldn't fathom any avocado It was terrible The salami pizza was acceptable but pricey The German beers as this establishment specialise in European drinks was about the best thing. If that's your thing then this place is OK
2
Food I would rate a #4 "good" however the rest was "Disappointing". Services #1. From having to get up several times to get cutlery to sugar to not receiving drinks till we had almost finished breakfast. Staff attitude #1, Capacity was only 2/3 full.
2
Mid afternoon the restaurant was not busy but we still waited an excessive time for a burger and caesar salad. Ordered a beer which was not cold. Food eventually arrived, the burger was acceptable but the Caesar salad was served with chopped up chicken leg meat including gristle skin and hair and was eventually abandoned. When mentioned to staff nothing was sai
4
Just across the road from Raffles Hotel, Marche does a great lunch and breakfast. We shared a pizza and salad for lunch, accompanied by beer and wine, as we watched the world go by. It's position on a busy corner with it's open front, allows for excellent people watching. We also had several breakfasts here. The menu has good variety and the service is very friendly.
2
Noisy, dreadful service, mediocre food. We wanted a simple family meal for last night in Singapore and after overpriced cocktails in Raffles thought this would suit the whole family. The 5 main meals all came at different times. One of us had finished their meal before the last was even served. We were brought 3 wrong dishes before the correct meals came. I resented the service charge and would have taken it off if easy to do but already added to the bill. Not much redeeming to say about it. The Pizzas looked good but we hadn't chosen those.
5
A nice and relaxed place to meet up with your friends for a meal or drinks. Friendly staff and great food.
3
Different from the other outlets where you can pick your own selection of food walking around, raffles only offers a menu. No aircon, pretty warm indoors. Food and drinks were much tastier at vivo city but friendly staff.
4
It is a good place to eat. You should try the apple tart which is freshly baked for you. Friendly staff, worthy to try.
4
Nice central location opposite the Raffles and Chijmes. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the food is solid, reliable and mostly Western. They are open early on Sunday mornings for breakfast (which was quite hard to find!)
4
We were caught out....Came back from the Night Safari on the Hippo bus link, about 22:30 and discovered all the restaurants and cafes around the area were closed as it was a Sunday evening. We were starving hungry - had expected to eat at Zoo, but didn't have time, and so were so relieved to find the Marche still serving. Had a wonderful supper of pizza and beer (or two) and it was really good. Highly recommended if that's what you need
1
I went there with family one morning for breakfast. We ordered an omelette, French toast, pancakes, fresh fruit with yogurt and muesli. The food looked good but tasted below average. The omelette was decent nothing special. French toast was flavourless and tasted like soggy bread. Pancakes were very rubbery and tasted like rubber. The fresh fruit and yoghurt was a lie. The dish should be called small diced fruit drenched in a hot yogurt, there was more yogurt than fruit. Lastly the muesli was muesli, nothing special.
4
Popped in for a quick lunch here as it wasn't too hot and we wanted some fresh air. It wasn't busy and we were offered our choice of table. The staff literally couldn't have been nicer or kinder. I honestly have tried to recall our waitresses name but I think she was Filipino from her accent? Our visit was around 2pm on 02 May if that helps? Anyway she was super nice and helpful. We had lunch special of pesto chicken pasta which was very nice and also the Pizza Salami. Salami was of good quality and with extra goats cheese the pizza was lovely. It comes on a big rectangular board and would be enough for two to share. Overall atmosphere was nice and calm and we felt able to relax and enjoy lunch. Bill came super quick as my friend had paid in the time it took me to visit the bathroom so I had no choice but to let him pay!
4
Stopped by for a quick bite, bread was really great, and you could share the continental bread basket for two (SG$8.90), this is definitely not a 1 person meal. The full breakfast (SG$16.90) was tasty but was served with some measly sausages, I was hoping for some proper ones. Service was excellent and the staff was very polite
4
we ended up here after a not very pleasant experience at Jumbo's Seafood, so the staff, atmosphere, food was just wonderful. The staff are extremely welcoming and the service was excellent. We ended up going there a few times during our 10 days stay. Would recommend it to everyone. Although we didn't have dinner or lunch there, looking around the tables they were almost always full and the meals look very appetizing
3
Wanting a change from the usual hotel breakfasts we decided to try Marche at Raffles city. Breakfast choice is quite limited but the big breakfast is filling. The wait is quite long even though the bistro was about half full, or seems like there are not enough people in the kitchen. At 9 in the morning there were 2 in the kitchen and two serving and making coffee, not enough for fast service.
3
The Marchers in Raffles City is a good location. The service was slow. It took very long to get a fresh beer. The food was to big.
However it this hot city is this location a good place, and we relaxed there.
4
Breakfast par excellence. German beer garden styled restaurant delivers with authenticity in flavor and decor.
4
Less than 1 minutes walk from the Fairmont hotel, close enough to still be on their WiFi. Also attached to Raffles CityMarche Movenpick offers a nice range of breakfast items at prices well below hotel prices and freshly cooked. Good serving size of fresh fruit juices at 330mL and excellent coffee
4
Our last meal in Singapore before flying home after three days, and we chose this place because it was close to where our walking tour of Singapore finished.It has a nice atmosphere, with inside and outside seating, and very pleasant service.We enjoyed our meals - I had a pizza, my wife had chicken Kiev, both off the lunch special menu. These were well presented and very tasty. Their home made lemonade is also most enjoyable
4
We visited Marche Bar & Bistro for a late breakfast.We were promptly shown to our table by a very cheerful waitress and our drinks order soon taken.The drinks took a long time coming and in the meantime we had ordered our food. Whilst waiting we observed all of the front of house staff literally running from table to table; at times having to ignore people trying to get their attention to avoid being slowed down.After a while a meal was delivered to me and left before the waitress quickly disappeared. I thought she had gone to get my wife's order. Looking down I realised that the dish in front of me was not the one I had ordered so called a waiter over to tell him He apologised and took it away. Soon after both our meals arrived. Before letting the waiter leave our table we ordered more drinks. Once again we had to chase them up.March was a nice place, clean and tidy with staff who were working very hard to meet everyones needs. The food was well presented and tasty but service unacceptably slow and trying to get anyone's attention uncomfortable.Our overall impression was that there were insufficient staff to meet the needs of their customers. Even with literally running around the restaurant they were unable to keep up.Hopefully this was an unusual experience. We would return in the hope that we just happened to catch them at a very busy time or when they were short staffed.My rating is higher than it might have been as it was clear that the staff were all working very hard; and the food and price good
3
On our last day of our stay in Singapore, we went for dinner at Marche as its convenient because nearby our hotel and surprisingly not so crowded for a Sunday. We ordered our food from the Menu of the Day ,,My wife had Salmon with pasta (It is just ok!!) and I ordered 1/2 pork knuckle with mash potatoes and sauerkraut. I got a big portion (suppose half portion) of pork knuckle !!!..and.easily I can share with 3-4 pax. Unfortunately, the meat is too dry and tough to chew too !! In general the taste of the food is ok but nothing special for a Marche which is located next to Brotzeit where the pork knuckle is much better!!...Service is fine but food is nothing special in comparison with the neighbors!
5
Six of us went here for supper and enjoyed an outstanding meal. We tried specials including tuna, lab, salads and soups. All of us were thoroughly pleased with this place. Service was great and prices for entrees were outstanding considering quality and portion size. I had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection, best meal so far on one month vacation. This meal was a bright spot after going to Raffles for $31.00 Singapore Sling across the street........... Don't waster time and money over there, eat this place, you won't be disappointed !!
4
If I'm 100% honest this place was perfect mainly because unneeded somewhere close to where I was staying and served good, quick food. Marche dit the bill perfectly, good food, well cooked and nice beer to boot. Very centrally located and good menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I'm mighty glad I chose this place
2
After walking around Raffles City we decided to have some lunch. I chose Marche as I thought it would be nice. Well sadly it was a disappointment. My son had the Ribeye - it was undercooked and did not come with the potatoes. My husband asked for it to be cooked a little more and also where were the potatoes. These finally came in a separate dish. The rest of us had the Pineapple Pizza. Thankfully this was tasty and enjoyable. The service is below standard and not what one would expect in Singapore. This is not a cheap restaurant but suggest that if you have the pizza you should be ok
5
Just across the road from Raffles Hotel and next to North Bridge Rd/Bras Basah Rd entrance to Raffles City Mall, we have been here on several occasions over the years. Breakfast pizzas are really good, as is the "Movenpick" full breakfast. All bread baked on premises and still warm when served.Service can be a little slow but worth the wait.Prices are reasonable with most breakfasts below S$10, expect to pay around S$15 with drinks. Service included
5
Fabulous breakfast here three days running, best Bircher Muesli I've ever had. Great coffee, great prices and great service from Daffine and Girish. Great spot for a quick lunch too.
5
Perfect spot for a delicious breakfast, the goats cheese tartine was amazing, as was the spicy salami omelette, fresh juice, great tea and coffee, friendly service and a great atmosphere.
3
Not bad for a quick lunch. The specials were good as was the grill menu. Service was not the best and all staff eyes were averted when trying to get the bill.
4
This along with the German restaurant next door are excellent places to stop for lunch as you shop the huge Raffles City Shopping Center.
4
Food was good our steaks served with roasted potatoes served on a Caesar salad. staff were friendly enough service was good. We didn't think it was anything special
5
Being a bit jet lagged and with a kid that did not have adventurous taste buds - this hit the spot- great coffee - and pizzas - the rest of the food looked good as well
4
In Center of city good place to eat good meal . You can sit all night long all watch people around .
5
It was so near to our hotel and just opposite Raffles that we decided to have breakfast. I had the muesli and my husband a white egg omelette. Both were delicious and I would definitely revisit. The restaurant was very busy which was a good sign. All the food looked good
5
This was a find for us as we were looking for some where to get a steak at a reasonable price and we found it, Marche has great menu options and can recommend the steak from the grill, it comes with salad and roast potatoes. This restaurant and bar is particularly busy but the staff are attentive and helpful. If you are looking for a nice drink non alcoholic try the homemade lemonade and ice tea both help quench a thirst
3
Walked passed this restaurant and thought, why not?Here are a number of reasons why not:Don't be fooled by the casual looking environment. The "handmade" pizza and pasta is average, a real let down when compared to the exquisitely worded menu. But all that could have been excused, but the service was atrocious! More interested in churning through what was left of a three quarters empty restaurant, staff had no knowledge of the menu. In the interest of fairness, they did have positives:The daily special of the day was a tomato soup, and it was really special, full of flavour, served with a sliver of garlic bread.
4
A very late lunch and the restraurant was quite.
Service ok and food was delivered quickly.
I had a salad and wings - both very good
Only downside was the price - too expensive for the style of dining and food
4
Serving of pasta and pizza was big. I enjoyed that. However, the coffee wasn't too impressive even if it was their own brand. I'll go back for food but not for coffee.
3
Stay away from the outdoor dining - situated next to one of Singapore's most busiest intersections - if you value your life. The persistent breeze blows all the smog and vehicle brake dust in the direction of Marche. Imagine what you're really eating.
5
The food is lovely and fresh, well priced and great service. Wood fired pizza oven, all pizza made to order. Serving a very large Yum!!!!!
2
Breakfast is quite ok, but the service is poor, based on two visits. Too many trainees who don't know what to do, whom need someone to lead them. Even simple requests (like can I have another cup of coffee) seemed to be difficult. About cold plate - would appreciate of having some veggies in it (tomatoes, salad, something). Bread slices are very thick. Good ingredients, but little bit more thinking with portions, and much more focus on service
4
Sat on the outside dining area. Yes it is near a busy junction and if it weren't for the fact it was raining the traffic fume could have been a problem. We had prawn crapÃ©Greek salad off he today's special menu Chocolate ice cream Vanilla ice cream Glass bubblyFresh fruits lemonade 2 lattes. Bill just over S$95The crapÃ© was a little thick and heavy The Greek salad was large. Both dishes were nicely presented. Ice cream could have been Hagen Das. Food was ok if a little on the pricey side. That's what you get for eating in the posh part of town.
4
After eating Asian food every meal for a few days, I started to miss having a salad made European style. Conveniently located right next door to my hotel the Fairmont, the MarchÃ© on the corner was very convenient. I had a Ceasar's salad which was delicious
5
Had a delicious lunch here starting off with home made apples, mint lemonade. Followed by nachos with delicious chilli, chicken wings, breaded chicken, salami pizza with red chilliest, orange cake and chocolate brownies. Very good service too. The bill for three was about 109 Singapore dollar
3
My wife and I dined at this restaurant for lunch over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend.The menu looked very inviting and, the food was good, however quite expensive. While we did not have any complaints over the food, it was expensive for the quality.My wife had a Margherita pizza which was big, it is done slightly differently to how you would expect, in that there is no tomato sauce used as a base, except large slices of tomato are used instead. I had the Spaghetti Carbonara which again was nice!We didn't sample any desserts as the mains were expensive enough!The service was excellent and the food good but, like other reviewers, the overall experience left us very 'meh
5
Food standard is always good and price point hits the mark. Very busy at breakfast with only 2 wait staff - poor girls were run off their feet. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my meal as did my travelling companion and I will be back when in Singapore again
4
We had a Super Breakfast there on the Last day of the F1. Super Coffee and Fresh Juices and Breakfast Pizza that sounds Odd but actually very Very Nice Idea. Not Cheap but Worth The Money.
3
We enjoyed our food but were disappointed to see both a service charge and GST added to the bill taking the cost up. It's a pet hate! Prices should be inclusive with no surprises. My bad for not taking more notice..... YMMV
4
We had breakfast here many days and it was always reliable, good value and great service. A good way to eat in expensive Singapore that is still tasty and enjoyable.
3
We decided to come to Marche for dinner given that it was close to our hotel and it looked appealing. Staff were friendly and prompt. We shared the mozzarella cheese sticks for entree, which was ok but pretty bland. I opted for the ribeye steak and asked for medium-rare, but it was pretty much still mooing and it was so grizzly too - I didn't finish it and the potatoes were still slightly raw. I had the banana and Nutella crepe, which was delicious.
4
Was in town for the Grand Prix and spent 4 mornings at Marche for breakfast.Why 4 mornings you ask? The breakfast pizza was my calling for the first 3 days and the berry pancakes on the 4th.On all occasions, the service the great, food excellent and the coffee was a welcome treat. Water was ice cold which was great considering the heat and humidity.Staff were happy to help with charging of my IPad when it needed it. I didn't feel rushed whilst there and highly recommend for both meals and service.Thank you
4
We decided to dine here due to it's proximity to our hotel. The staff were pleasant and the restaurant well presented. The steak is was a basic meal but was prepared really well and was thoroughly enjoyable. Unfortunately the chef was unable to co-ordinate his cooking and our cheese sticks hadn't arrived by the time we finished our meal, the only disappointment we had
4
Located in Raffles City, you'd assume that this would be quite an expensive place to go. Not the case at all! I was pleasantly surprised to find this place as I wanted a drink and something quite light. They have the most delicious lemonade! I had the nachos which given that it was only meant to be 'lite' was rather generous! It tasted good too.The service is great as well. You do not wait long at all to be seated as the staff are so mindful of anybody standing at the entrance. Inside, lovely service - really attentive.The view is good as you can just watch the passing traffic of cars and people
4
I love to come here for the pizza. It is quite a large portion and the price is reasonable. Comes out piping hot from the pizza oven. The pork knuckle is ok but could be more moist. The rest of the items on the menu are average
1
Ordered sea bass with pasta, chicken with salad and two glasses of wine. Unfortunately my chicken had blood in it so I had to send it back. My partner was left eating on his own whilst I waited for a fresh meal. When this was brought out, the second piece of chicken was undercooked and had blood in it. I was offered an alternative but chose not to, one I had lost my appetite and two, my partner had finished! I explained that raw chicken was dangerous due to salmonella and we should have the cost of my meal and both glasses of wine taken off the bill. They wouldn't do this and agreed to remove my meal and my glass of wine. Poorly handled and worrying if a chef cannot cook a piece of chicken. Would give this no stars if I could
4
A nice place which even though not the usual air conditioned restaurant was still pleasant to sit in and relax. We had pizzas and nachos, both good. We also had lemonade and some wine. Service was with a smile. Convenient location as taxi and mrt right there to get back afterwards
3
Not really special but stopped here to have something small to eat. Ordered pizza and drinks..the staff was friendly and helpfull. Waiting time was pretty normal for a pizza and it was nice food. The view is nice, you can sit inside or outside.
5
We stopped here to have a late breakfast, and what a breakfast it was. A breakfast pizza and pancakes. Great flavors, and great service, nothing was rushed but nothing was slow. Great sitting outside and watching Singapore go by.
4
Was looking for breakfast early and this was one of the few places open. Ordered butchers muesli, farmers breakfast and some buffalo cheese sandwich. Great flavour all round, maybe a bit more basil with the buffalo cheese. Filled us up. Large fans and had raffles hotel opposite. Bathrooms were clean with some interesting old photos on the walls. Service was friendly and prompt. Reasonable price.
4
Having dinner on a business trip.Really good meat and very well done. Coming with salad that is better for dinner. I thank that too.Later I had very good vanilla ice dessert.Nice that they don't have strong air con inside, and open doors, so the temperature inside was very pleasant
2
Ordered a "beef carving" from the menu, but instead got a lump of fatty steak just simply grilled.Correct me if I'm wrong, but carving usually denotes roast beef. When I enquired, initially the waitress tried to pass it off as a carving, but upon pressing the issue more, admitted that it was only that particular evening that the dish was presented like that. I think the more basic reason is that they ran out of roast beef for that evening.I would have given a 1 star if not for the fact that after persevering, the waitress did not charge for the "carving". Appreciated the gesture, though it really took some prompting
5
Had breakfast here on my last day in Singapore on a lovely cool rainy morning. Enjoyed sitting outside enjoying the lovely weather. What made the experience even better was the delicious food (the most amazing french toast EVER) and courteous attentive service. Would love to go back again just for the french toast alone
3
Pizza was good, crispy, lots of tomato. Service variable, dishes dirty, wrong order and ice cream came in a dirty bowl. Staff tried to say this occurred as they scooped the ice cream... Don't think so it was chocolate and were having vanilla! So stick to pizza. No offer of water, all rather pedestrian from a service perspective. If as you do sit in the outer area be prepared for the smoke wafting from smokers who loiter. It's gros
4
I you ever tried to look for breakfast options in Singapore, you realize that usually everything is close until about 9:30-10:00 AMThis place was open since 8:30 They have great breakfast options, fresh juices and coffee. Air condition and even place to charge your mobile or tablet [ask the waitress]Service was good, waitresses are nice.Not very expensive and very tastyMy recommendation
1
A simple pizza was asked for without mushrooms. The pizza was delivered wrongly. No apologies. Waited another ten mins for the next pizza. This one was served with chicken when it was mentioned earlier that we wanted a vegetarian pizza without mushroom. Again no apology. A shrug and that's it. I've Been to Marche many times but it seems that the staff now is overworked and could care less for what you order. Be careful. At your own risk. Given then twenty minute delay and two wrong orders we missed the movie. Good luck in trying this place out.
4
Being a single traveller not keen on Vanetines night but you need to eat! (Also CNY). They were several couples seated (all on their mobile devices, how romantic) and a cross section of people. The ladies were all given a long stemmed red rose. Service friendly and food good, I had chicken. German beer went down a treat. This was my last night in Singapore otherwise I may have eaten there again
5
this is a great place for lunch just across from the raffles hotel. The pizzas are really great for sharing and the fruit mix delicious. nice ability to eat outside
5
We ate in here twice last week for breakfast during our stopover in Singapore on our way home to UK from Australia and were very impressed. Food was very good, staff friendly, and very efficient. Excellent service!
3
It was a Saturday night and I came by Marche for dinner with some friends. They have indoor air-conditioned and outdoor sheltered al fresco seating area. We opted to sit indoors at a high table. We also ordered food to share amongst ourselves.Here are the highlights of my meal:- Half portion of pork knuckle. Rather big portion of sauerkraut with mash potato on the side. Good to share amongst 6 pax.- Smoked duck breast pizza. This came with hoisin sauce, spring onion, red chilli and celery. Very oriental, 'East meets West' flavors which worked out well. - This pizza caught my eye when I was going through the menu. It's Tuna sashimi pizza! Pizza was topped with tuna sashimi, mixed greens, wasabi mayo and ebiko caviar. Rather tasty and its not bad! - Dessert! Freshly-made crepe with slices of banana within, topped with a scoop of Movenpick stracciata ice cream and drizzled with Nutella. Something so familiar and comforting to the palette and tummy! The concept here is a little different from the previous Marche that I have been to, where you go to different live stations for your food. Here you browse the menu and make your order, much like any other restaurant. You can see the chefs prepare the food in the open-concept kitchen though.Restaurant is centrally-located and easily accessible. Good for meals with friends and family
4
Apart from the hotels it is hard to find an early opening place for a western breakfast in Singapore.Most food courts don't open until 10. I had a breakfast pizza and my wife had eggs and bacon. Coffee was ok and all for a reasonable price in an easy location
1
After a show at SOTA we took 3 hungry kids for dinner on the weekend. What a mistake!Ordered, beef crepe, nachos, pork knuckle and Hawaiian pizza. Everything tasted way below average: crepe was soggy and tasteless, knuckle was greasy and smelly, and even the nachos was wasted.Better off going down to the mall for a more tasty meal.Never again

Food is pretty good - when you get it, but the service is awful. They are totally disorganised. 4 different staff visited our table with not the faintest idea what was going on. Several other tables complaining too. I asked for the device charge to be taken off the bill. No apologies just a grating "Have a nice day". Best avoid.

Looking around for CNY dinner and just needed some more bums on seats. Good service, reasonable menu, good prices and tasty food. Service was good and no rush on ordering. Try a Mohito, it was really strong, german beer was tasty, chicken wings and pizza was very nice too. Finished off with a swiss hot chocolate. A good evening both leaving fully satisfied

We ate hear for breakfast because it was near our hotel. I ordered the pancakes and the boyfriend ordered the platter. Pancakes had berries in them and it looked like a murder scene but I didn't enjoy it. They weren't fluffy pancakes either, more flat. The platter was decent but nothing special. A bit pricey but it's understood with its central location. Eat if you have nowhere else to go. I would have rather eaten in Starbucks instead.
4
Different concept from the one at Somerset. I actually like the pizza they offer, huge pieces where you can share among friends. I am always there for dinner, one choice if i wanted to have pizza when I am at city hall area. It opened slightly late, so late supper is possible
4
The staff made it easy to sit and eat quickly. We had dinner one time and split a Hawaiin pizza (delicious thin crust with pineapple & ham that had flavor). I'm a sweet crepe fan and Nutella and banana is one of my favorites! Oh man did they balance the amount of Nutella to banana ratio right! It's even topped of with ice cream. Definitely would go back just for desert. We went back and had breakfast the following day and the breakfast pizza was average. I think my hopes were extra high after dinner and I'm not much for breakfast either. Still for the $$ you walk away very fulfilled.
3
The place has an open concept, which looks nice, but doesn't really work in tropical Singapore. They've got air-cons and fans, but with everything being open, any cold air generated is gone. The food is Ok, fanciful but not that tasty. It is definitely overpriced.
4
We recently had dinner here and the location is perfect and the food was good, the staff are friendly and the service was pretty good. Great for relaxing with a glass of wine and watch the people go by.
1
We ordered Clam Pasta and Greek Salad, the pasta came without clams and replaced by salmon and some calamari. For the Greek Salad, it came without feta cheese or any kind of cheese and they put eggs instead. Both dishes were tasteless and simply horrible.
4
Came with a friend and had pizza. Arrived around 10-11 pm and the kitchen was still open, so a good place to eat late.
3
Was there for dinner. The pizza (smoked duck breast) is good. The serving is big enough for 2 persons. However the service is average.
4
Exceptional location near to cbd area with al fresco seats. Always busy. Good food, nice staff. Have to change some items on menu maybe.
Quite expensive.
1
Molds on the cold cuts. They changed one portion but not the rest of the tapas.
Terrible staff service. Takes too long to serve and even takes time to get the bill.
Not fresh ingredients. Have black spots on my potato.
No coming back again...
4
Great little place, great location from our hotel. Pizza's were well priced and delicious however maybe a little more ingredients would make it even better. Service was good. Menu was quite extensive and priced as reasonable as Singapore gets.
4
After a very disappointing experience at Raffles (Steakhouse and Halia) this was a great surprise. On a Monday night six of us had great steaks and desserts but most of all the service was superb. Very attentive and friendly. Our waitress Nicole never stopped smiling and was fantastic. Very nice ambience outside and a cool breeze. Highly recommended.

In this building, breakfast options used to be overpriced offers from the 2 hotels. Thank goodness for Marche. My favourite and usual choice is the Swiss-style bircher muesli with fresh berries. Today I did the Marche Movenpick breakfast - a robust meal which will last the whole day - 2 eggs, 3 sausages and 3 slices bacon, excellent house baked beans in rich tomato sauce and a bread basket. The coffee is also in my view the best in the area.
4
Have been here several times now, mainly for breakfast. Coffee is good and the food and service is always consistent. Well worth a visit.
4
We came here after work for some drinks and food. Reasonable selection of beer and wine, prices ok. Food was better than expected and service was friendly enough. Convenient location near City Hall.
3
First night in SG, late dinner, really it was all that was opened around our hotel. It was nice food, big pizzas if your tastes are not aligned with fellow travelers you may waste a bit.
Service was a little short, but ok.
5
even itÂ´s a chain they provide one of the best pizzas in SG. The seize allows to share the pizza for 2. Our favorite is the one with feta and olives!

Dropped into this restaurant for a bite to eat mid-week after a morning of shopping in central Singapore. Service was friendly and efficient. The menu offers something for everyone and the daily specials are worth looking at too. Prices were very reasonable, portions generous and the quality of the food was good. Kitchen staff were able to accommodate my wife's food intolerances without fuss.I recommend Marche for a casual lunch in the centre of Singapore
1
At 11am on a Sunday morning the restaurant was practically empty. There were only 6 other tables occupied. The service was disorganised with everyone from the manager, waitress and runners clearly requiring more training. You need to know your menu and you have to know your which tables are which. The team on duty did not know their menus, were not able to articulate recommendations, delivered servings to the wrong table multiple times (they kept sending us items meant for the gentleman at a table next to us). They did not have cutlery for children and the baby chair was covered in food from the previous occupant. The breakfast set was delivered without the breads and it wasn't until we enquired that they bothered to serve it. Multiple requests for service went unattended and the runners took their lunch break at approximately 1130am in the dining room itself leaving service levels to deteriorate event further. Very disappointed and one of the rare times when I almost lost my temper. I understand how difficult the service industry is but there are minimum standards which clearly the management at Marche need to work on. Totally took away from the fact that the food was actually quite decent
3
Bistro is ideally placed on the corner of Bras Basah Rd and North Bridge Rd and offers (or did) 1 beer at full price and the second at half price.The beers were German and served nice and cold, just right for a hot day.Food Menu was sparse and offered very little. Not the best place to eat
4
Arrived in Singapore for the first time and needed a late dinner. We had the dried meat pizza (can't remember the name) and it was brilliant. Service was good however they did forget a part of our order and we had to ask again for a couple of drinks hence the 4 stars. Good atmosphere too
4
Our family had breakfast at this lovely restaurant at least 3 consecutive mornings. The fruit juices are freshly squeezed, the food is really tasty and fresh and the bread and pastries are delicious. The Cold cut threesome and Nuhremburg Sausages were a big hit with the kids. The bread basket with a selection of different slices of breads and croissant was also fresh and tasty! Each table comes with a bowl of fresh green apples to eat/take and it was free of charge! The location is great - it is opposite the Raffles and Carlton Hotels and is situated on street level in the Raffles City Mall. Wish it had aircon, as opposed to only large fans

You pay for the convenience, location and ambience. Marche serves crepes, salads, pizzas and bar snacks. Portions are massive so be mindful. I had the roasted chicken crepe with a side salad...it was too cheesey and the salad comprised of tired old leaves. You can give this place a miss if you have time to explor
4
A great place for outdoor dining experience. Greeted and attended by friendly smiling staff. Delicious roasted duck pizza and nice German riesling. If only the wine glasses were not wet and water still dripping, the whole experience would have been perfect.
4
We enjoyed the food in this place. It's casual dining with good pizza's, salads, sausages and crispy pork knuckles! The staff are very friendly and accomodating
4
A nice place to eat a tasty European mixed green salad with bread!!! They serve after 10.00 pm, good service and nice terrace. Try the cake with Swiss chocolate.

We have been regular breakfast customers at Marche's Raffles City branch for some time as we love the bread basket and the ham and cheese platter. Service had generally been consistently good. Today, we had the worst experience at the restaurant. Our usual order of bread basket and cold cuts took over 20 minutes to arrive (they don't have to cook the ham!!). The sausages took even longer. And the scrambled eggs turned up looking like omelette. We had two very hungry children in tow, which we politely mentioned to the server the moment we arrived. No one bothered to mentioned to us that they were short-staffed in the kitchen and that food will take longer than usual, just so our expectations are managed. I returned the 'scrambled eggs' to the kitchen and asked for a standard scrambled egg, not an overcooked one. The version that came out was a little bit in between a scrambled egg and an omelette. I had given up at this point. Sadly, we won't be going back there again

Just thought of having breakfast all by myself and remembered this particular marche restaurant at raffels....by the way I am a big marche fan but this was my first visit in this particular restaurant.....and it turned out to be a nice outing with a nice breakfast in a nice ambience and a nice service....loved the breakfast here. Ordered seperately so next time I would take there suggested breakfast meals instead of ordering choice which is a pinch higher on your pocket...but definitely going for more
4
On our first night in Singapore we were fortunate enough to stumble on this restaurant very close to the Fairmont and Raffles. After a long flight over, this restaurant was so handy and the food, Australian/European was very welcoming. We were able to sit outside and watch the world go by.Food was very good and wine/beer very reasonable
5
During our stay in Singapore we had breakfast at Marche twice. Staff was always friendly and attentive. Creative breakfast menu - typical English breakfast (baked beans, sausages, ...), sweet and savoury crepes, Muesli, fresh fruit juices and their coffee is just great!Prices are a little above average, but everything is fresh, portions are huge and taste is good
3
We noticed this Mache outlet at Raffles City Mall and decided to give it a try after finishing our shopping at the mall.We decided to try out the Pork Knuckles as it offered half portion size. We like the mixed salad and we also ordered BBQ Chicken Wings. The portions of the food are large and the staff can allow us to share.The staff was friendly and atmosphere was good even we were sited outside the non-aircon areas.The disappointment was the food we were having are all not hot!
3
Ate here for breakfast, it was ok. I had a tasty breakfast pizza, my wife the Bertram musli, (actually a grated apple with about 7 seeds in it) & we both had terrible coffee's, they just tasted off, I mentioned this to staff and they were more than happy to take these away and offer us another one or something else. Will go back, just not for coffee, although the fresh juices others had looked pretty good.
4
Have been going to this little gem a number of times now and have to give it a review.I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as it is close by my normal hotel in Singapore. Service is always outstanding and friendly and food comes fast and is tasty. For lunch or dinner I can highly recommend their Tuna steak and for desert I have to recoemmend their pancake with banana and nutella - very nice too
3
Went here because I liked it in Jakarta, but this one had much less on the menu and was much more expensive at 150 for a family of four.
4
The special chicken was great, and well priced. Service was good (took a while to order a second drink or get the bill... My only compliant) wine was expensive but you expect that in Singapore. Overall a good experience and id go back
4
Went here for dinner after a sever bout of jetlag. Most kitchens close at 10 but this opened later and food was pretty good. Shiraz was wonderful.
2
+ friendly staff
+ good location
- high price for a la carte food and wine
- main course was served just after we started eating our entrees
4
The most standout thing about this restaurant was the staff who were so friendly and efficient. They really made our several meals that much more enjoyable. The food was really fresh and much of it made and baked on site. The coffee was consistently very good. No air conditioning but open to the outdoors so a breeze coming in off the street usually helped.A good wine and beers list. Thoroughly recommend
4
I enjoyed a very nice salad of Mixed Greens, with vinaigrette and Smoked Salmon here. It was a generous serving, accompanied by a piece of pizza bread - quite tasty. To complement this, I got a Bloody Mary cocktail. Very nice, thanks. They don't muck around either, the service is swift and food comes pretty quickly. I'd come here again. The open sandwiches that other diners had look gigantic - might try one next time

The best thing about this Marche is its location on a sidewalk where you can do people watching and have 3 views of Singapore - a slice of famed Raffles Hotel, another slice of old Singapore named Chijmes (a convent originally for nuns, orphans and girls)and the modern Carlton Hotel (not Ritz). Quite often a trishaw rider resting on the handlebars sits at this corner of Carlton Hotel! The restaurant is setback quite well, not right on a hot dusty street - just one of 3 such eateries in a complex of hotels, shops and offices known as Raffles City where there seems to be close to a hundred food outlets -from the basement to two of the highest restaurants in Singapore - Equinox and Jaan.As such, we found Marche was fairly warm at noon on Friday! So beer was the drink of choice. I had gone ahead to grab a table as they do not take reservations, and on Fridays it attracts groups of office workers. We kept to lighter foods such as salads, cheese platter and the special of the day, a perfect portion of grilled (or was it panfried) salmon. Not quite bistro fare, i must say. All were pronounced good, as we finished our meal with the famous Movenpick ice creams before we walked back to our respective offices !It was a pleasant way to start the long weekend, just by slowing ourselves enough to feel relaxed and cooled off well before sun set
3
One of the few restaurants open on a late Sunday night, this place does the job: we wandered in at 10pm and we had a good pizza and a few drinks. Quality and service are OK, while the price is in line with the area, ie quite expensive
3
First look at the place, you will love the location but hold on it just stops at that. Marche is a well known chain for fresh counter food. Other locations as the somerset one where you have live counter food you won't be disappointed, as you can actually pick what you want, all fresh . This outlet( raffles city) is a bar and restaurant and with a weather like Singapore, you will agree that one needs a/c first. Anyway get over a/c and come to the menu which wasn't too elaborate. While other things on the menu looked great and I have been to this restaurant many times but for this outlet, it's high price to pay .I asked for a vegetarian crepe which was average but not worth the money spent. After a meal you don't come out too happy:( much as I wished. So my two cents for this place:-1. Locations is good2. No A/C, I would recommend , if you have to go , please do so in the evening and not afternoon.3. Expensive, you would rather go someplace else and have great food at good price and location.4.There are many options where this place is , so you wouldn't mind looking at them , you'll get good priced food and taste is guaranteed.5.Staff is friendly but people serving you don't cook you see.6.For vegetarians, limited options
4
We went looking for European food and found it. Comfortable seating, nice decor, no tub thumping music. Friendly staff, our meal arrived quite quickly and was perfect . It was a bit pricey for essentially a cafe, but we are in Singapore. The wine list seemed a bit limited but quite adequate.
4
Friendly, engaging staff, good service and an excellent pizza cooked in a wood burning oven. That they serve Warsteiner beer just added to the experience. A bit on the pricey side, even for Singapore!! Also, receipt has wrong date printed.
3
Visited for dinner on a busy Friday evening. Limited menu but served quickly by friendly staff. Food was average and no local dishes. Good atmosphere but really expensive wine â€“ check the prices on the drinks menu carefully.
4
Very good location - in front of Raffles hotel; modern and comfortable design; big enough variety of meals; nice staff; will be perfect if there are WI-FI internet;

A couple invited us to this MarchÃ©. How were we surprised when we saw it and realized immediately that this MarchÃ© is different from the others. Here you choose from the menu card and you are actually served by friendly and helpful staff. This MarchÃ© is excellently located, near several hotels, like the Raffles Hotel. It is also adjunct to the shopping mall Raffles City, easy reachable by public transport. Wow - their breakfasts to choose from are delicious. We tried four different ones and they all were of excellent taste and quality. I enjoyed an omelet. Also we all chose a different hot drink and we were happy with these too. Their hot chocolate milk is served in a big bowl like we know them from up in the beautiful Swiss Alps. I never knew there was a MarchÃ© with such a great and relaxed atmosphere. Truly enjoyable. As soon as they will have more than one highchair for babies, families with children will feel more at home too

Came here for lunch as its a convenient walk from our office in the city. Was attracted by the open concept of the charming restaurant whereby you can get a good lovely of the sidewalk of Raffles City and Raffles Hotel which is just across the road. We choose the seats outside to enjoy the nice sunny weather. We had the salad with salmon and roast chicken and the rib eye steak that came along with the Caesar salad and roast potato followed by coffee. We enjoyed the salad with salmon and roast chicken which came in a big portion, the salad and salmon was fresh and the and the chicken was well cooked. We had to wait a while for the rib eye steak and we felt for that price, the portion was too small and found it a bit overcooked and oily. The service was fast and efficient. Will come back again for its convenient location lovely restaurant and good service but will stick with the salads..
3
Had to go out for dinner alone and bumped into Marche Bar, buzzing with life and people eating. Noticed the huge pizzas but ordered the sunday menu prime ribs; very nice risoto, nice salad and thinly sliced not really great prime rib. Risoto was not hot but still nice. Service was great with a nice smile, however price was over the topppp. 60% of it would have matched it but all over okay for a meal. For 2 persons - go for the pizz

Amazing pizzas here! recommended to try if you are a pizza fan! loved it :) Went there for lunch and dinner. The service is also excellent. Try and get there on time to get seats for lunch and dinner .... very busy place check out their grills too ! looked too goo
5
This restaurant is immediately adjacent to Raffles Hotel and offers excellent food at a very reasonable price. Their breakfast menu offers some specialties including delicious egg white omelette and a crepe filled with scrambled egg and ham. All this can be chased down with a variety of coffees plus fresh juices and a bread basket to die for. If you happen to be staying at Raffles this is the perfect alternative to their extortionately priced breakfast. Highly recommended
4
This is a nice bistro close to some good hotels and shopping. I've been here on prior trips when I needed a little break from the local cuisine. The pizza's are very big and they are pretty good. They have a nice selection of starters and a wide variety of drink choices - Beer, juices, etc. The wait staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great. There seems to be a fair amount of locals taking it easy after shopping in the mall next door
4
Like most thing in Singapore not cheap but this is prompt, nice ambience with music and a good mix of customers from visitors to ex pats and couples. Chicken was nicely cooked with a healthy helping of iceberg lettuce and roast potatoes. The chianti was nice if perhaps needing a little warmed. Great for people watching and opens out to raffles and chijmes. Excellent location! I would eat there again. Didn't feel uncomfortable at all dining alone... Well maybe for a second when I realised it was unisex toilets!
