This place is close to my working place. Great coffee, excellent ambience. Wonderful staff. Resonable pricing place. I come here to buy coffee if my work starts at 9:00am or 9:30am. Thunbs upüëçüëçüëç

Came here after lunch. Not as crowded or noisy as other coffee places. The coffee here is nice with choice of either Brazilian or Ethopian beans. Price is also reasonable.

Definitely the best coffee in the area. Being asked to choose between 2 beans and you know you're in Jewel. This unique system makes you try new coffees everyday.

Awesome standard coffee with nice ambiance and friendly service. It was top one quality of coffee so far among my experience, sure will return again for my future cups.

Great coffee. Choice of origin (Ethiopia or El Salvador). Served in mugs with decent handles. We had flay whites and I could tell that the Barista wanted to make us something we'd enjoy. This place is busy for a good reason. Staff all happy. Opens at 7am. All good.
