What a fantastic restaurant. Why is it not higher in the ratings in Singapore. Four gorgeous course- one was complimentary. Loved all of it. Art means food!

Company received food poisoning for the deserts. But the manager was too kind and made up for it with a whole bunch of h

The Salted Caramel Popcorn ice cream was some of the best ice cream we have ever had. Unbelievably buttery. We went back the next day.

Went for a birthday celebration. Food was fantastic. Staff were friendly. And as a bonus recrived a free birthday dessert

Went to celebrate our anniversary & we loved the food so much that we know we’re gonna visit again soon. Ordered Cod & Crispy Charcoal Nest for mains: Cod was cooked delicately & it melts in our mouths but the Collagen Broth that comes with the Charcoal Nest left a deeper impression as it was so full of flavour! And of course, dessert is a must order, and we were hooked with Cassis Plum after watching Masterchef & it was the highlight of the day. Really a piece of art, the balance between sour & sweet was perfect & it was a refreshing palette cleanser. We would like to commend on the service by the server too, it’s a shame we didn’t catch her name but she was attentive & polite throughout the night; and helpfully helped us arranged another pairing for Cassis Plum since the usual pairing Umeshu Elderflower wasn’t available. It was a really pleasant evening to be spent with such delicious food

Coming from the US for 3 days so I made advance reservation here. The Plum Cassis did not disappoint. However, the chair as well as the table was wobbly, sort of spoiled the otherwise an excellent experience. Will be heading to the Tokyo Shinjuku location next month so let's keep our fingers crossed

Great ambience with beautiful colourful arts. Quiet for lunch which we enjoyed. Excellent staff service by Melo. The other Chinese staff, pleasant but service too casual for this classy restaurant. Melo was sharp, meticulous, great in anticipating our needs. Love the food!!!! Janice Wong should get Michelin star!!! Such great talented chefs, love the culinary arts, presentation, taste. We had de degustation menu & we were blown away!!!! Melo presented to us the a birthday treat!!!! So wonderful!!!! Tks to Cassidy from HK (cobo house) who helped us make de booking & arrangements. Highly recommended to go.

serves Chinese soup dumplings and colourful noodles. I think the place is overrated for this. Portions were small and nothing great as far as taste is concerned. Definitely over priced. But desserts were something else. they were great and very artfully presented. Other reviewers have complained about service. we found the staff friendly and attentive

Couldn't wait to try this desert bar. Walked in and thought this is not what I expected. Very contemporary but no ambience. Was expecting deserts on display but nothing. Ordered two deserts and a port for the husband. Both just tasted blah. Nothing to write home about. Paid $86 and thought "never again"

The service staff looked towards us while we waited in line to be seated. They then turned and walked away. The other patrons waited with us to be guided to our tables. After about 5 minutes (it seemed longer) the service staff again reappeared and looked towards us. Deciding it was of greater importance to clear tables where other customers had let they set about their task with a level of energy that would ensure they would not be tired at the end of their shift. Needless to say this approach dampened our enthusiasm to eat and we considered leaving. Foolishly we persevered and were rewareded with a similar standard of service to our initial tortuous seating experience. Overpriced and food of a lesser standard than many hawker stalls left us feeling disappointed. Still the Museum is a great place to visit so please go there - but eat somewhere else

I finished my second cup of ice cream in two days from Janice Wong... a shop I accidentally bumped into. The ice cream was really good. The smoked ice cream and pistachio were fantastic. I highly recommend this place.

Had the set lunch, choosing the xiao long bao, spinach pasta with prawns & shared the desserts, chocolate praline & tiramisu. The dishes were nicely plated, especially the dessert. Food was overall good though the dessert stands out above the rest.

Absolutely stunning dessert selection.
A hidden jewel in singapore. Must visit for those who cherish good creative desserts.
Absolute delight and highly recommended.

We splurged and got 6 full sized desserts to share between two and what a treat it was! Absolutely would recommend to any foodie travelling to Singapore. Cocktails were great too.

I’ve always admired how Janice Wong turns desserts into a work of art. Beautifully crafted and decorated, the offerings are a step into heaven. Not only were they delicious, but super instagram worthy as well. Highly imaginative.

We booked a table here for lunch and desert - probably don't need a booking as it wasn't too crowded. We ordered a few different dumplings for lunch - they were amazing, each plate was a work of art, not at all like your normal simple dumplings. We then followed with deserts - the lavender desert and the cheesecake. A lot of hard work had been put into the deserts, after all this is mainly a desert place. We found the deserts a little bit too sweet, although they were definitely worth trying and I would recommend anyone to visit here for a meal and desert

I visited Janis Wong's restaurant at the National Museum of Singapore and although I had done my homework I was so pleasantly surprised.I had a simple lunch basically three different appetisers inc soup so I can save room for the dessert. I have to admit the savory part of the meal was far more impressive than the dessert. It was Devine

Other than the signature desserts that the chef is known for, the dim sum and main courses are well worth a try. Presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner, the food is not only a feast for the eyes, but equally enjoyable to the palate. Topping it off with an excellent service team, this cosy restaurant takes museum dining to the next level

i visited the place for just dessert.experience was so so, staff didnt have too much passion in introducing or recommending.the seating was not too comfortable or relaxing I would say.dessert is ok, but not with too much surprises.it's good to visit if you want some quiet time

Everything is done with aesthetically done - From table tops painted with multicoloured chocolate paint to each bite-sized dim sum! The location is lovely too, in the beautiful grounds of the National Museum. However it's outside the main building so you will need an umbrella on a rainy day. The gyoza dumplings in many different flavours were delightful. The scallop somen and barley noodles were great. Janice Wong is famous for her desserts so must leave space for this. The toffee pudding and the churros with dipping sauces were superb! We also had a variety of macaroons - kaya, salted caramel and mango. Will definitely be back again
