Chinese restaurant with varieties of choices. Very good taste, nice display and helpful staffs. The atmosphere is very cozy. You can see the nice view of Swimming pool. The desert is also very delicious!

Tucked away in Science Park is this Cantonese restaurant with 20-feet floor to ceiling windows and more
Importantly, tasty Cantonese classics. Prices are reasonable and the staff friendly. Will be back with the family soon.

Came here for lunch and ordered the lala with bee hoon, xing hua noodle and champagne pork ribs.
Ooh la la! The soup stock was yummy and the pork ribs were such scene stealers! So tender and full of flavours!
Recommended!

As the location is not downtown, this place is probably not well known to many. Their signature dishes like sauna prawn, clam bee hoon, 3 eggs spinach, etc. are indeed tasty. Service is excellent and ample parking. We ordered their chilli crab and the meat was fresh and the sauce not half bad with buns to go with the sauce

I've been to Diamond Kitchen at least 4 times with both friends and family. And every single time I go, the food is scrumptious!! I especially love the beef hor fun that has perfectly cooked tender beef and brilliant beef sauce! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! The service is also extremely quick- my food came in less than 15 minutes. Definitely worth a visit

Conveniently located for me as I work in the area, I've had such there many times. There's a decent selection of rice and noodle dishes for takeaway, although the whole a la carte menu is available for takeway too. There's a set lunch, which is enough for 4 people and at $68 is great value. The salted egg squid is excellent, as are the pork ribs. In fact, I've tried so many dishes there and all tasted good. If someone just randomly ordered from the menu, everything that is served will be delicious. Sometimes, there are too many customers at once and the service slows up but the staff actually run from table to table t try to get things happening. Good food, decent prices

Had lunch here on a weekday and lots of tables begging for customers. Service was so-so but it's the food that's the real star. Ordered beef hor fun and you could really taste the wok hei and the generous sprinkling of black pepper. The deep fried salted egg yolk calamari is truly fabulous and deserves the good reviews it's been getting. Crispy and salty on the outside and fresh and firm on the inside - perfect! The 3-yolk spinach was also good. All in definitely one to revisit.

This restaurant caters to the Science Park One crowd, I guess as it is a little bit far from the business district and tourist places.Yesterday, I hosted a business lunch for 7 peoplein this restaurant. We ordered- Salted Egg Sotong- Champagne Pork Ribs (apparently, a popular dish)- Crispy bean curd with chicken floss- Superior stock clam bee hoon (very tasty soup!)Stir fried Nai Bai with Garlic- Salted chickenAll of them were nice. My favorites are the champagne pork ribs, the bean curd and the superior stock clam.Total bill came up to SGD144 only (including the drinks, wet tissue, chinese tea, ). Great value for money.So if you happen to be in Science Park one on business or a visit, try this restaurant

Great Chinese restaurant hidden in a way out place - would come again if I happened to be in the area. They have set menus so it does seem worthwhile for a big group. Some of the dishes e.g. The beancurd looked nothing like the photo on the menu though. Otherwise good place to come for Chinese if one doesn't want to go to town.

Delicious Chinese food served by extremely attentive staff. This place came recommended by a friend and my family were so happy! We ordered the dishes under "media recommended" such as clams bee hoon (rice noodles, $28), salted egg sotong (calamari, $21), champagne pork ribs ($21), three eggs chinese spinach ($18), cereal prawns ($33) and minced meat beancurd ($21).We brought a cake there and the generously provided us with disposable cutlery and a plastic box to bring the remaining cake back!You will need to drive to this place but there's FREE valet parking. The valet staff are so helpful and polite too. Therefore, you can just tip them! :
