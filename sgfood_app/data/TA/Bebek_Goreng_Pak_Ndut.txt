The crispy duck is delicious - under different forms: original, shredded, crispy skin, crispy feet. They don’t have soursop, so have the yummy sour soup that cuts into the fat.

After shopping souvenirs, candy and chocolates in the Lucky Plaza Orchard area, we can stop at this Indonesian restaurant for lunch or dinner. The place is small and clean, also we do not have to wait too long to have our meal ready. Beside the most popular crispy fried duck, the grilled duck is also delicious with hot sambal.

You wont find label "Bebek Pak Ndut" in Indonesia, but their fried duck definitely reminds me to "Bebek Goreng Pak Slamet" which came from my hometown - Solo (Surakarta). Just the same!!!You can try their "crispy duck" if you love the juicy taste of the duck flesh, and you can go for their "crispy shredded duck" if you'd like to get something that dry and crunchy from beginning to end. The portion will look alot bigger on "crispy shredded" cos they pull out the duck flesh and double fry it until it reach the certain level of crispiness (it looks like a floss but it's not a floss).Their "sambal korek style" is recommended if you love spicy food and don't miss their duck feet too!The downfall for the beverage is they don't use real coconut milk for the es campur or their beverage which using coconut milk so the smell of the instant coconut milk is still remain and that's not good :(. They can mix the instant coconut milk with water (1:1) and put some pandan leaves and bring it to low heat until the artificial smell is gone instead using it directly from the instant package.If you love Es Bandung and you want to try something more kickin, then u can order their Happy Soda. It's like es Bandung but they use soda instead of water in it and it's pretty famous in Indonesia. Recommended! â™

Was treated for lunch here by a good friend and enjoyed the meal very much. Lovely grilled "pengkang" or deliciously grilled/ roasted chicken with Indonesian chilli/ spice sauces and greens. Enjoyed it with Teh-Botol, an Indonesian bottled sweet milk tea. Wasn't too crowded when we showed up at 130pm on a weekday and got our table immediately. Not bad for an Orchard Road restaurant at lunch time.

Recommended by one of my colleague, we went to this resto at Lucky Plaza complex, 1st floor. We went there after lunch to avoid the busy hour time. We ordered the fried duck with original chilly sauce (sambal) and the one with the green chilly. We like them both, but the best part is, we can take more variance of the chilly sauce free! We also had the gado-gado (mix veggies with the peanut sauce), it was a bit spicy but so good.. We tried another fried duck in Bali but this one doesn't really taste the same, but it's already really good for us (even a bit too greasy). Once in a while won't harm i told my self! :

We ordered grilled chicken, gado gado and duck skin for our meals. Skipping the usual fried smashed chicken. The grilled chicken turned out to be great, accompanied with the Super spicy Chili. The rest of the dish are average. Shall return again for the grilled chicken.

I went there with my family.. My children order bebek (duck) and i ordered gado gado (mix vegetables with peanut sauce)... The taste is delicious.. I love it very much.. Their gado-gado is big portion for me... Because the taste is great.. I can finish it easily... My children also love the duck... Very delicious... I also order coconut... For my drink.. Really good to release my thirsty throat... Their price is not too expensive.. Compare to other.. But do not compare with bebek pak ndut in indonesia... You can reach bebek oak ndut easily... It's located at lucky plaza.. If you come from the main entrance.. It's on the left in the back... They still open until 9pm... We came for our late dinner.. So.. Come and try..

First tried the food from Tampines 1 Branch by ordering through foodpanda delivery. Despite the lack of restaurant ambience and time lag due to delivery, the food tasted warm and succulent. The kids and elderly at home enjoyed the shredded crispy duck rice thoroughly. Be warned, the chilli was extremely hot. We went to the restaurant a few days after and the grilled chicken and shredded crispy duck were both wiped out. To say the least, nice
