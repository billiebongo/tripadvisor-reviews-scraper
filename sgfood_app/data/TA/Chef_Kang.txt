Great food and recommendations from Chef Kang's private kitchen. Tried the crab beehoon, roast pork as main favourites. Slightly on the pricey side but worth a visit!!

A humble private kitchen with only 4 tables. We ordered most of their signature dishes. Unfortunately, not all the dishes were impressive or mind blowing, but they were all good stuff! The Signature Vegetable with Marble Goby Soup was a good start of our dinner, followed by a few other dishes - Shrimp Paste Deep Fried Pork Belly, Sizzling Char Siu, Steam Crab with Glutinous Rice and etc No doubt prices are expensive, and I believe is higher than some diners would expect for the quality and overall experience. Just like us, we were expecting more since they have gotten their one star recognition. Food: 1/2Price: 0/1Overall experience: 0/1Will we return: 0/

Had a fantastic lunch were with colleagues today. Ordered the Soon Hock soup, fried egg plant, deep fried pork belly, Portuguese styled pork chops, bean curd with broccoli, salted egg prawns and the bee hoon. All dishes turned out really well and my favourites were the soup and salted egg prawns. Intimate restaurant and nothing fancy. Definitely need to make reservations well ahead of time

This Michelin recommended restaurant in Singapore fell below expectations.It took 5 weeks of an advance reservation to secure a table for our foodie gang of 14. Expectations were high, maybe too high.......We preordered all of the signature dishes to allow adequate time to prep. Chef Kang was even present for the entire lunch, but seemed a bit indifferent.3 of the 7 dishes were above average, buy not spectacular. 3 dishes were average or below average. The desserts appeared to be "take out" orders from a supplier, so they didn't count.The price was steep which is fine if the quality was there.A disappointment after all of the Michelin buildup

The family decided to celebrate a birthday and we booked ts pace two months in advance. A small place with like three rooms only in which the largest room can accommodate thirteen to fifteen people. The smaller rooms about ten to twelve.The place was a bit cramped for us and it was no five star eatery.Food: Personally for me, the 'Char Siew" was good, the soup average and the 'Portuguese Pork Ribs With Man Tou' was average, and the 'Tofu' too. We had a veggy which was ok.Service: Great service by China waitresses who kept on apologizing when ever they severed a plate.Very attentive and helpful.Overall, if you want to try 'Nuovo Cantonese cuisine' then it is worth a try

If you are somehow scared of pork lard, get over your (irrational) fear.The first dish of tofu served up had a gravy redolent of fragrant pork lard. The second one was stir-fried chives with dried shrimp and crispy pork lard. These two simple dishes were our favorites. In fact, Chef Kang told us his little eatery uses up more than 200kg of pork lard each month! We were fortunate to snag the three-seater table at the one-star Michelin restaurant by Chef Kang on a Friday evening. Located along MacKenzie Road across from Rex Cinema, this eatery is done in Hong Kong 'private dining' style with three small rooms, and the small table next to the entrance, can only accommodate 40 diners (or so they claim). There is an air of exclusivity and you can't just walk in because the door has an electromagnetic lock controlled from the inside. Of course the prices match the Michelin accolade; after all, what do you expect - 'tzi char' (Chinese stir fry) stall prices?If you do go, do moderate your expectations and frankly, not every dish is a winner, or to everyone's tastes. The braised pork ribs with deep fried yam matchsticks of yam had a coconutty flavor. The ribs were cooked to perfection but the sauce may be too rich for some. Similarly, the pork chop with Portuguese sauce was too cloying. I thought Cantonese cuisine should have lighter flavors. The specialties of the chef are listed with colour pictures on a laminated sheet of paper, without prices. So do ask before ordering because the foie gras with roast 'pipa' duck cost Sing$46 a portion and the minimum order is two portions. However, the foie gras was fried to technical perfection, a surprise from a chef of Cantonese cuisine. So should you give the good chef a try? Yes of course. Do call to make reservations. And avoid the largest room as the toilet is located therein, hidden behind a curtain. Otherwise, belt up for an interesting culinary ride.

Overrated & overpriced for mediocre cooking standard. Couldn't imagine a dish of about 10 pcs of prawn paste chicken wings cost S$48! Worst when we couldn't even taste the prawn paste. The soon hock fish soup for a table of 7 at S$128 was totally not worth it. We could cook this at home. Expectation was high on our first visit but totally disappointed. Better to park our $$$ elsewhere. Will not return

Though location is not buzzling, it is in a central location . Restaurant is comfy with air conditioning. Hearty Chinese food.Certain dishes a little too oily but I guess this is a very delicate balance. Very good cooking.We brought with us some wines and offered them to Chef Kang and he was nice to share some of his favorite bottles.We noticed server(s) poured a few generous amount for themselves when we had only intended it for the Chef.Pretty soon we find our bottles going very fast.Our best guess is that the server may be a next of kin but we cannot be sure.Unfortunately there is always the black sheep.Will certainly go back for the honest and very good cooking

We ordered the Chinese Omakase 7 courses lunch including dessert. The fish soup are very very good , very well boiled and tasty. The prawn paste fried pork belly are non oily and feels light though it's pork belly, tastes even better with the Chichalok Chilli. Salted /pumpkin egg prawn are fine - comparable to some I have eaten. For the main - the seafood Kway Teow are very good with strong wok taste. Very small restaurant with just less than 10 tables. Service just like any other Chinese restaurant

Fish soup to start. Must!!!Full of flavour, this is Cantonese comfort food to warm up the stomach and set the tone for a nice evening with friends.We moved on to Dragon sprouts. Never had these before but they had a nice crunch with a mild spicy XO sauce.I asked for the duck with foie gras to come next. This would have gone with a nice riesling. (They do not charge corkage which was much appreciated.)Unfortunately, the chef's famous barbequed pork was sold out by the time we ordered. In its place, crispy pork was recommended and it was a simple yet effective dish. A good friend had brought along a Morey St Denis red and it held up beautifully. Our last main dish was the coffee lamb cutlet. Mmmm the umame in this dish was paired up with a bottle of Chateau L'Evangile.Rounding up the night with coconut ice cream and jelly, we rolled out the door at 11pm. An evening well spent

Tucked away in a shophouse in a quaint neighbourhood, this cosy little Chinese restaurant is a true hidden gem. Unique dishes created by Chef Chef are cooked to perfection and served by very attentive staff.

Chef Kang private dining showcases traditional Cantonese cooking with flair and finesse. Booking in advance is necessary as seats are limited. The KL noodles and bee hoon is to die for. Ditto for any of his soups

Its company's dinner night and the Boss and his friends swear by this resto!!Never expect to find such a fabulous Cantonese resto in this neighbour (so near to Little India). Chef Ang Song Kang however is Teochew, and he used to helm Lei Garden resto. Be sure to make a reservation if you do not want to be disappointed by popping in. The resto only has 3 private rooms and space are packed very tightly. Just go for the amazing and awesome cuisine and not expect a kitschy decor. Let the food speaks for itself!!We had the Marbled Goby Fish Soup which was really really delicious! Be sure to ask your server to add more soup. We love it so much we made 2 orders! Next to the do not miss items will be the lobster noodles. (Do ask for mee kia as its goes better with the broth). And just our luck, Chef Kang just roasted his char siew which had burnt molasses sticking to the bottom of the pan! Fab! And do order their home made braised toufu. The Sweet and Sour Pork also gets my vote. We had a few other dishes on the menu. Or you can actually just ask Chef Kang what the special of the day is and go omakase with his recommendations. Can't go wrong. Just be sure to finish up your delectable meal with the coconut ice cream, served in a small coconut husk.Altogether an amazing feast

My recent experience in this restaurant compelled me to write this review. Despite the hype I found this to be over priced and of poor value. The "omakase " menu at $78 pax served up very common fare that is hardly " the best ingredients the season has to offer" I was left slightly embarrassed by the dishes especially as it was my mom's 75th birthday. The dishes offered would be more appropriate for a family meal in a "zhi cha " place. I would certainly not be returning

Fried fish in soup - very good, think it's even better than the one at Paradise Teochew Restaurant.Wasabi prawns - okay but don't like it stickyChicken in a cage - niceCoffee pork and sweet pork (again that sticky stuff which I don't care for). I like the coffee pork.Tofu, shiitake mushrooms and broccoli - very nice especially the tofu.Fried kway teow - a bit burnt like it should be with prawns, vegetables and scallops - nice but I wish it wasn't sticky/starchy.Coconut pudding with coconut ice cream - some of us like it but not me.Lemongrass jelly - lovely.$77 per head

The restaurant is being considered as one of the gourmet haunts in Singapore. The location is well in the city centre and can easily be reached. Both the ambience and service are good. The quality and choice of food are also good. The price is in line with most 5* rated eateries. However, there are dishes which are difficult to obtain in other restaurants; for example the "Emperor Fish" from East Malaysia. This fish became top choice after a TV travel documentary name it :"Forget Me Not" dish !!! The price is in the region of S$2000-2500 per fish depending on the size and season!!!Do visit and have a taste of Luxury

Went to chef Lang last night for dinner with old friends. I tried their recommended pork two way and it was chewy both ways. Over cooked and flavored. The tofu was ordinary. The kailan was stiff and oily. The double boil chicken soup was the only good dish

Reservation is a must here, so if you are planning to have your meals, do book in advance. Overall had a pretty good experience here. Food served was not overly salty, and tasty. However for the price, you could probably have it somewhere whereby you can get similar quality, on par or even more outstanding dishes, take into consideration the long waiting time for each dish to be served. Service was prompt, and staff are friendly too. Enjoyed the crispy eggplant, fish soup and fried noodles

A small quaint simple chinese decor restaurant which can only sit about 40 pax so prior booking is recommended. Park at the open air car park opposite the restaurant which is next to the Rex theatre. Food is good and service friendly courteous and efficient with regular change of plates after each course. Had the marble gorby or Soon Hock fish in creamy soup. Two course pork ribs, fried prawns with almond, tou foo with broccoli and the Cantonese fried kueh tiow . Really loved the fish soup which is creamy and sourish from the pickled olives. Fish was so fresh that our young 5 years old granddaughter asked for more. Fried prawns were crunchy yet soft and tasty with the blend of mayonnaise cream n almonds. Tou foo in oyster sauce was good too. The two styled pork ribs were served with mayonnaise n another in honey sauce. Price was reasonable due to the freshness of the fish n the other dishes. Can go again.

The small place of 4 to 5 tables has made booking difficult. The food is still as good as what he served at his previous locations but prices have gone up. The fish soup was tasty but I could feel the use of MSG. The duck was good but I found it salty. The tempura styled egg plant with pork floss was nice as before. What I liked best was the pork ribs in two styles - tasty and juicy. Go if you miss Chef Kang's cooking. Overall, the food was good but far from outstanding
