used the entertainer app, so it was value for money. portions were pretty generous as well. would return.
4
The food was not bad and thankfully we had entertainer for our meals. The food was authentic but abit pricy.
2
The food is average, the portions are small and over priced. Don't think it's worth it, there are better places to eat at, in and around holland village.
4
The restaurant has decent selection of food and the service was great. It was good to start the year at this place.
4
We were early for lunch and the everything was served fresh! The lamb shawarma was great!! The pita bread was nice and soft with the humus. The lamb dishes were surely better than the beef or chicken dishes. Both minced and chunky lamb dishes were both good! Service was great and reasonably fast. Will surely visit again.
3
The food was ok ,but definitely not authentic. It taste more like Indian food than Lebanon or Mediterranean.Service was great and that's a plus for this restaurant. The decor is very simple and doesn't give any impression of Arabic or Mediterranean environment. I guess that's the reason one of the reasons why you don't see much people in this restaurant. The manager should look at the prices as they are very expensive. Dinner 28/01/201

Had the 4 course set lunch starting with Fresh lentil soup. Appetizer was falafel, hummus, tabouleh & pita bread. I was almost full after 2nd course. Main course was rice serve with lamb kebab n cabbage pickle and ended with not too sweet yet crispy baklawah. Food was fresh & tasty. Seasoning was just nice. Service was fine. I will come back to try other food items.Note: set lunch menu is same everyday. Only soup changes daily

It's very average middle eastern restaurant. Nothing very much to rave about.slightly over priced.the dips and hummus doesn't come with free pita bread. Pita bread is chargeable at $5 per basket and portion are very very small. It's not crowded and only a few table were occupied on a Thursday night
5
Qasr Grille is vegetarian friendly and the overall ambiance is very warm. Our server Gunalan made sure our wines and water were filled and gave good suggestions on what mains to have. Lamb shawarma and Eggplant kebab were the highlights of our night. Soft warm pita breads were excellent pairings with our tasty Hummus. An overall great dining experience at the corner of Holland Village.
4
Shared the vegetarian mezze platter with a friend when we came here for dinner; the chef managed to prepare us a lovely assortment which we thoroughly enjoyed. The flatbread used for dipping and mopping up the sauces was fresh and tasty too!The wines proposed at the restaurant was quite extensive, and we weren't disappointed by the recommendation. As it's located at Lorong Mambong, a busy watering hole at Holland Village every evening, I think it forces this place to compete with the surrounding pubs and bistros. The difference is of course, one gets to eat a nice Lebanese meal instead of bar snacks.We're definitely coming back again to try the other dishes on the menu. They all looked really good.Service was professional and waiting time appropriate. Prices reasonable. Only draw back is that one has to pay for water at the restaurant
4
This place is becoming a regular for us. The food is consistently good, the service polite and prompt. The toilets are also well kept and clean. One of our favourites in Holland Village.
4
Laid back place with good selection of menu. Love the flavours.
Will be back again for other options!
3
We chanced upon this place looking for a different restaurant for Father's Day but we weren't disappointed. Food was good, and because it's an open restaurant, there weren't terrible acoustics to deal with which allowed for conversation. Overall it was an enjoyable experience.
5
Great menu, variety, busy... good service. A great addition to the Holland village restaurant options.
1
your not getting the quality that you are paying for. Expensive for no reason compared to the quality of food provided.
4
Enjoyed an evening with a large business group for an after-work casual drinks and dining. Food was a mostly Lebanese, middle eastern fusion but was great. Beer and drink options were great.
2
Decided to give it a try because of the good reviews, but left frankly disappointed. Taste and preparation is not lebanese or mediterranean at all: from the first taste of the baba ganoush we ordered as an entree, things went south fast.Service is average an so is the place, but nit the bill. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re definitely not getting the quality you should be getting for the price they charge
5
We went on a Wednesday lunch time and there was only one table occupied which made me very nervous. However the set lunch offer and previous reviews kept us there. The food turned out to be very yummy. The portions were also quite large and I wished my friend and I had shared because we were not able to finish. Would definitely go back.
5
This restaurant in Holland Village is near the end pf the street, so it is easy to miss. It is quiet, and a very cozy place for lunch or dinner. There is quite an extensive Mediterranean menu with appetisers and main dishes. We found the food to be delicious, the beer cold, and the service attentive. The ambience was also conducive to a relaxed lunch with good conversation. We will definitely go back
4
The restaurant was not due to open till 11.30am, but we managed to book an 11am slot via Chope, therefore confusing the owner/manager/staff. However, he quickly welcomed us in and set up the place for us, taking our drink orders and kindly informed us that it might take awhile for the food to come. Food was tasty, and service was good. Will return
4
As a vegetarian I found the choices at Qasr plentiful. The service was a bit slow to my liking but the service and the food mase up for it. The portion of the dishes is very decent and the price is competitive.
2
Ok food, but forcing people to buy bottled water is both cheap and creates lots of plastic waste. Disappointing.
5
nice food,friendly staff ,mezze platter super good teste, meat we love lamb chop, sure visit again soon,
3
Food is good, house wine is nice. However, the overall look and feel do not match the actual prices. Waiters hardly speak english, portions are quite small, whole pace looks a bit worn down.
5
Had a taste of Middle eastern cuisine and was worth it.The pita bread with dal was amazing.Light and tasty.Dont miss out on the Kebabs and Bakalava.
4
Friendly staff. Nice ambience. Food is good. Went there using the entertainer app. My Son loves the lamb kebab.
1
3 main points. If any of the below applies does this stand for "service"- Takes the menu every 5 'minutes when the complete group have not come- provides dirty glass, does not replace, try to joke and plays with phone. No sense of urgency or the care of where the place he works. I had to get the wine glass myself from the bar.- Bit disappointed when heard such great things about the place.We were an easy group of 8 Constantly asked to pay the bill. Asked that the outside area closes at 1115 from 11 constantly asked to leave.I have no idea why people previously have provided great reviews. We have come with friends that are local and say they will never come here also again.Seems like they were rushing to close. They lure you to drink in the "semi" indoor area however they rush to close everything and say they can drink "as long as you want." infact they shut the shop, turn OFF the lights while 6 customers still in.Last night in Singapore really left a sour taste
3
So the Holland Village street was closed and all the restaurants were full. Maybe because this place was further up the street, it wasn't full and somehow the atmosphere didn't carry up. The waiter had a really strong Indian accent which was hard to catch and they didn't have a children's menu. Food was okay - not out of the moon but we enjoyed it. Would have been good if they could have indicated the spice level on the side.
4
One of the better middle eastern dishes I have had. Although decor is not as fancy as some other restaurants, the food was tasty and the service was attentive and friendly. Hommus and motabal were good dippings with the pita bread. Portion of the lamb shawarma was filling, but I wished the portions of the grilled dishes could be bigger. Chicken cubes of the shish taouk were super tender. Lamb cubes of the shikaf kebab were flavorful and juicy. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I will return
4
Went today for lunch at Qasr grill. It was empty during peak lunch hour just one more table but Set Lunch did not disappoint.Waiter was reluctant to tell what dishes are in set lunch, we opted for both Veg and Chicken kebab set lunch. Soup was average and appetiser of Pita, falafel and hummus was tasty and so was Main dish of Chicken Kebab with Pita and Saffron rice. Dessert was a piece of Bakalava, ever tasty.Service was average, place is good. Good lunch option in Holland V for Middle Eastern Food besides Al-Hamra restaurant

1st time here.
Happy with Ragu's service.
Recommended our 2 dishes which was superbüëç.
Will come back again with more friendsüòÑ
Thank u Qasr for making my Bday a memorable 1üëè
5
The opening Mezze platter was superb, the Shish awesome.
Pricey at ¬£164 for three people, but well worth the cost for the food and the service.
5
Here with 3 other friends to try out the food. The ambience is good and the food is simply tasty.Strongly recommend the lamp and the seafood (prawn n fish) which is really good in portion for sharing. Not overdose but just nice for the taste
5
Came here for a weekday lunch on the recommendation of a friend. It was great, fantastic value set menu with more food than I could finish. We had a delicious lentil soup, hummus and bread, grilled vegetable wrap for mains and a small dessert. The food was fresh and tasty, with just the right amount of spice. Lovely restaurant setting tucked away in the far corner of the holland village restaurant street, away from the main crowds. Nice open room with lots of light and fresh air, but without the heat from sitting outside. Staff were also lovely, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Service was quick and all four courses were served within an hour, perfect for a work lunch. Recommend for a casual business lunch with colleagues or a quiet lunch with friends. I will be back, can't wait to try more from the menu.
3
We were there early evening on a weekday so the restaurant wasn't packed. The food was nice and served hot. Indoor seating is comfortable for catching up with friends as it is away from the hustle and bustle of drinking outside along Lorong Mambong. Worth a try for the experience
1
We have been coming to this restaurant for last 10 years. This time we ordered shirazi kebab. Kofta kebab. Sheesh tauok, shawarma. Arrayes kofta. No taste. Food was stale . And horrible. We looked at the Holland street and all restaurants were full. This restaurant was empty. We asked the manager ..kuljit Singh what happened. ? He kept saying good food. Not ready to accept our feedback.Price of $26 ++ per dish and they have reduced the size of kebabs. Rice quantity . Price not justified. Is a complete rip off.We have decided never to come here again
3
We dined here as a three-generation family of five. In addition to starters, we shared a vegetarian platter and a meat platter. The food was okay, but rather cold. None of the dishes stood out. Total bill = $166. The service was okay until as the host I came to pay. For some very curious reason, the card reader seemed stuck in a loop of "insert card" and "swipe card". Finally, they asked me to pay cash so I had to fork over notes I had for non-card purchases. All very curious
4
Finally had time for a date night after much business travel. So glad we walked by the first Lebanese on the left as we strolled down Lorong Mambong. Don't stop til you reach Qasr one of the last restaurant on left. Nice atmosphere on a Friday, air con indoor or fans on deck outdoor. For crowd watching on this bustling strip sit right in the street. Nice menu and couldn't decide so plumped for the dinner set. At S$85 + Gst for two was a steal, including 2 alcoholic beverages. See photo for full menu. My fave were the 2 succulent fresh prawns followed by the lamb kebab. Thumbs up too for the crisp motabal, all washed down with a chilled Asahi beer! Neither of us were so keen on the Beef sawarma ( too much cardamon or clove?). Owner immediately offered to replace with something rise, but we were too full already. Large portions meant we had to doggie bag our dessert, baklava. Still crispy stored in the fridge after 2 days. Good food, friendly service
4
Was taken here by a work colleague. Firstly the road the restaurant is in is vibrant and full or places to eat, drink and dance. A very Western area.The Qasr is a very nice and friendly restaurant with both outside and inside seating. We ordered a selection of dishes recommended by our waiter which all tasted very nice and made for a pleasant evening with a few draft beers as well
4
Nice place tucked away inside Holland Village. You have to walk down right to the end of the road. If you are looking for a quiet dinner, don't go on the weekends as this is pub hopping central. The streets around are full of revelers partying their cares away after a hard weeks work. But well, its not rowdy anyway. Its Singapore and everything is well contained. Just that the streets are loud. This restaurant sits right at the end of the street so some of the noise is filtered out. There are places both outside, for the smokers, and inside. The decor is not too bad. Their bar menu leaves a little to be desired. Choices of beer is very limited. They don't have stout and have only two options for draft. The food however is quite delectable especially the mixed kebab platter. The stuffed Peta bread was top notch. They also serve up a mean hummus and spicy sauces. Everything considered, this is not at the helm of fine dining and not really cheap but its not bad either, especially considering middle eastern food and a little drinking on the side, you can give this one a try. We didn't try dessert since a big haagen dazs ice cream bar at the entrance to the street completely laid wage to all else on any dessert menu on that street
3
Lebanese Food was quite ok but it was closed at 11:30 PM without warning, our beer glasses were still full when staff closed the restaurant and shutdown the lights !
Quite a weird experience !
5
A real find. Will certainly go there again. Staff were pleasant and attentive. The food was some of the best I've ever had in Singapore.
1
Far from beeing as tasty as what middle east food could taste. Big disappointment. Service was slow and food was not so warm when we received it.
4
Situated in Holland Villlage buzzing with activity.Was there with family and friends for dinner and had a rocking time.The bar is well stocked and the bartender is a very friendly guy(?Jerry).The mediterranean style cuisine of humus kebabs etc was finger licking.Evening was well spent.
1
Well, we love lebanese food, and the diner we ordered was not terrific at all.
The mezze was not tasty and size of dishes were very small.
The meat such as lamb and chicken were discusting....
to avoid
and quite pricy ......
4
We were drawn here by Eatigo App. While family enjoyed the dinner in a quiet setting, the quality is a little below what I am used to in middle east. The kids enjoyed falafel, swahmar and hummus. The pita bread was freshly baked and hot when served. As it was slow Sunday, service was excellent.
5
Qasr is a great spot on the top corner of Holland Village. It's a pleasure to sit out at this open-air corner cafe when the road closed to cars at night. There are plenty of food options around so I'll tell you why we like Qasr: We have found the staff to be lovely and personable. Food is fresh and full of flavour. The menu has a good selection for both meat eaters (husband) and vegetarians (me). We like to have the Mezza Platter and the Mujadara (lentils and rice). The pita is served puffy, fresh, light and warm. The falafel that comes with the Mezza is light and crispy- though it only comes with 2 so I suggest ordering extra. They often bring us complimentary little side dishes to try with our order.  Don't expect snappy 5-star service here. It's casual. It's hot out. If you have an evening to relax with a G&T in this open-air Lebanese cafe, especially when the rain is falling down, break off a piece of warm pita, dip in the fresh tahini-thick-hummus sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and enjoy
3
Had Dinner here again as have eaten here before and was very good.Unfortunately this time the meal was not so good as before and was not as authentic as the last time.Seemed as though they were cutting some corners and quality was not so good.Overall the meal was pleasant however definitely not to same standard as when we have eaten before.In discussion with the server, he indicated a new Chef had started in last year and hence the authentic cooking had gon
3
Holland V had a lot of options for drinking and eating. We chose Al Qasr last night as we wanted mezze.Food choice was good with a mixed mezze to start and Chicken cous cous and lamb kebab for main. All the food was great but it was just a shame that it all came at the same time despite asking for the mezze platter as a starter. So we had no time to enjoy either starter or main and we were all done in about an hour
5
Just went to try Qasr Grill and Mezze Bar in Holland Village. Casual modern decor with chill out ambience. The lady owner Sangita was friendly and recommended quite a few delightful dishes for us :Hummus dip platter Lebanese Omelete Summer Fest PizzaParsley Salad with goats' cheese Grilled Mutton skewers Grilled King PrawnWe almost rolled out the door as we were really full. In all for 7 of us we spent slightly above $200
1
First of all, the restaurant's atmosphere was not all that bad, and some of the waiters were friendly. What really bugged me though, was the lack of knowledge the waiters held. A friend of mine ordered a drink and the waiter was clueless as to what the drink was, he even had to ask the manager quietly what it was and the manager told him to google it. Don't get me started on the food, this place served a sad excuse of a shawarma, which tasted mostly of spices and was obviously served with an imbalanced temperature. Was the food microwaved? Half of my group did not even receive their fries and when we asked for them, the waiter rushed back to the kitchen and practically threw us the fries in a small bowl. Not to mention the rudeness of the manager, I understand that it can get stressful in a busy restaurants, but come on
2
Let's start with the positives. They offer microbrewery beer on tap, its actually quite nice, and before 9pm it is reasonably priced (S$8.9 per pint) for Singapore. The ambiance is pleasant.Hmmm.... cant think of any more positives. So on to the negatives...The service is slow. Often didn't see my server for 30 mins or more. I wouldn't mind if the food was worth waiting for. But it was not. It just doesn't taste how it should. I don't know if has been toned down for the Singapore market, but it lacks those gorgeous flavours of the middle east. The kebabs from Shiraz are much better, and even their kebabs I would rate as "average".That said, the restaurant was quite busy. Taking a look at the scores for this restaurant, it is quite an unusual profile, quite polarising. In other words, some people love it, whilst others hate it. Well, I am definitely in the hate camp. But you may well love it, you can only really tell by giving it a try. But it doesn't come with a recommendation from me
1
We have been sitting here for 2 hours. First one hour, we waited for drinks. For the next hour, they only change the charcoal for the sheesha once. After we asked for more charcoal, we waited for half an hour only to be told that the kitchen has closed and there's no more charcoal. Not only was the kitchen closed, the toilets were closed too and we couldn't use it.Okay, so about the drinks. The coffee was watery and the Martel was mixed with water. The only dish we ordered was four pieces of nuggets on a scattering of fries. It looked like what you would get in a primary school canteen except it costed $7 excluding tax and gst.Unless you have plenty of patience, wish to smoke only a few puffs from the sheesha and just want to eat a few pieces of nuggets, there are better options in Holland Village.
4
I have been to Al-Qasr many times and it never fails to deliver quality as far as food is concerned. If you are adventurous like me, try the mince raw lamb (reminiscent of steak tartare). It is a must have with a very delicate flavour. The kebabs are all good and the mainstay for me.Prasad the manager is always at hand to help and he aims to please. All in all, satisfying experiences
3
Went there for the 2nd time last weekend. I thought they were okay the first time. The second time confirmed that they are overpriced ($28 for a lamb kabob khash khash) which was average tasting and confirmed they are inconsistent with their food quality. Our guest thought her shawarma tasted like fast food from a mall. And the most ridiculous part is this is the only restaurant I have been to where they offer a humus dish but no pita accompanying it. Yes, you have to order the pita bread separately and pay extra for it! The waiter looked confused when I asked how one ate the humus if there was no pita. Clearly a rip off. Smelly washroom to boot. I would not go back
2
We went over the Holland Village for dinner and of course all restaurants were full, except Al Qasr, which was maybe 1/2 full at best. We were seated quickly, then it went down hill from there. The waiter convinced us to order the most expensive foods on the menu, though we told he we just wanted light portions. We were with our young son who was very hungry. It took a long time to get our food, then the person serving had vast confusion. Then it went even further down hill. Our waiter seemed to morph into a cashier and the new waiters (who over I could flag down) would say "yes yes yes" then never come back. It took so long to to get the check that I eventually had to stand up and walk towards the door. The original waiter came back and apologized saying how busy they were, but the restaurant at that time was less than 1/5th full (I now understand why). The service issue was not unique to us, tables around us had the same problems - wrong orders, slow service, highly confused asian waiters
2
The seemingly senior waiter took our order for a Mezza platter then another waiter took our order for mains. The mains turned up before starter then the staff brought the mains back 3 times when we finally got the starter. This was in spite of us stating we wanted to finish the starter before our mains. Staff did not listen. When we got the bill we were charged $5 for bread. We had assumed it was part of the platter and at no time did a waiter tell us we would be charges. When we pointed this out the senior waiter was rude and told us bread was needed for the platter. We had no argument with that but it would have been nice to have been informer. Again he didn't listen to the feedback and missed our point completely. Food was bland and very salty. Won't be returning to this place.
4
Went for dinner with another couple and they had not had Lebanese before so food was quite good for them to get a good cross section of Lebanese dips and kebabs, hommos, tabbouleh, eating with your hands and all the good stuff.Relatively quieter end of Holland Village as well so not as noisey and full on as the restaurants in the middle.Was a semi-business dinner as well and had plenty of time to talk and not have to yell over others.Some of the staff were a little more "non-fussed" on service however overall they were very good and have no hesitate in going back
2
We live at Holland Village and normally go to Al Hamra. We thought we'd try this place to see how it was. Nothing was authentic, everything was tasteless, service was pretty average. I wouldn't actually care so much about service if the food was great, but it wasn't. We had to add salt to everything to try to make it taste like something. And to top it off, it was expensive. I would honestly say, go to Al Hamra, it's just a few doors down and way better food
4
Went there to celebrate my mom's birthday and was very pleasantly surprised with their gesture of goodwill in celebration of her birthday and their great service !They offered to cut our hard ice cream cake on our behalf ! The lady's service was fabulous , always checking if we needed anything...The lamb shawarma , falafel were very delicious though kids spaghetti needs alot of improvement. Chicken morsel was made of breast meat though not dry. Lamb chop is harder while lamb chunk was more tender.
