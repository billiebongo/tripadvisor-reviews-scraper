Large selection and they cater for different nationalities. Gluten free was no problem. We did not go the for the evening buffet.

Crave for Penang flare then this is the place. All in one. 20+ dishes to fill your appetite to the max. Prepare for lines as there are no reservation. Staffs are attentive. Food is acceptable.

Food is average, prices are cheap.
Hotel service staff ranges from very good to very poor....
However the cooks attitude are horrible especially the fried kway teow.
Will never go back again.

The food is very good; the cafe has a good Chef especially in the area of local food. However, there's room for improvement in the level of service.

The cafe is well known for its Penang Hawker Buffet for years and it has been a long time since I last dined there.So my family and I decided to revisit it since we are looking for Singapore Flavour's Food and currently the cafe is offering the ala cart buffet, mostly local cuisines.We dropped by at the cafe at 12pm on a Sunday. The cafe was quiet then (but in a while, it was quite pack of diners) and we were ushered to our seats by friendly staff. The ala cart buffet menu consists of about 25 dishes (including desserts), mostly curry oriented. Not surprising since the chef in charge, Celebrity Chef Charlie Tham is the curry master chef!!! If you are a curry fan, you should not miss this place!Nice and cosy ambience though at some areas the hotel/cafe may look dated but would say the atmosphere is more of "nostalgic and vintage" feeling, bringing back memories of our growing up days.The must try is the Fish Head Curry, very nice and yummy and yet do not contain much coconut milk, unlike others, and you will not get tired of it! The portion is huge with lots of other vegetables like ladyfingers. Great to have this over white rice!The Beef Rendeng, Curry Chicken, Chicken Masala, Black-Ink Squid are all nice and tasty. Flavourful and you could taste the different kinds of curry. The crispy Chicken Drumlet is very nice too, crispy on the external and tender and juicy on the internal.The Goh Hiong (minced pork wrapped in bean skin and deep fried) was passable, the Nonya Chap Chye was ok (too wet and the vegetables were a bit overcooked), Clams were not bad.We didn't manage to try all the dishes but would say about 70-80% and most of the dishes were quite good and nice!And not to be missed are the desserts, very refreshing and super delicious, such as the Ice Kachang, Chendol, Cheng Tng and Black Grass Jelly. Great to have them on such a warm and sunny day!Service wise. Overall good! Staff were friendly and nice, though at one point of the time (the initial session as there were a large group of diners storming in), our used plates were not cleared nor our drinking water refilled but they were very responsive and reacted promptly when we waved at them. The celebrity chef was seen to walk around the cafe from time to time (besides seeing him cooking via the open-kitchen concept) and talked to diners and solicit feedback. Great Job!Suggestions for improvement. Would say, if they can add on another 1 or 2 more dishes, such as fried noodles or rice, sambal or chilli prawns (since they already have fish, squid and clams and why not prawns or crayfish). In addition, to have coffee/tea included in the menu and with some fresh cut fruits (just one or two variety will be good enough). With these, it will be perfect. (even if they are to up a little on the buffet price, I think its still reasonable)Value for money? Yes, surely. Currently they have a 4-for-3 promotions (meaning, 4 diners paying for the price of 3) and quite a good bargain, over a nice curry spread of dishes!Recommended especially for curry fans

My family 3 pax went for reunion buffet dinner. We were offered a complimentary dish of abalone yusheng by the supervisor of White Rose Cafe though restricted by hotel to serve for min. 4 pax per table. Appreciated with the supervisor for such friendly arrangement & will definitely return for ala-carte buffet lunch and Penang hawker food fare

I ate here twice this week during my stay. I have to say the food is ok, but nothing better. Some of the staff are nice and a pleasure to deal with, some are just plain miserable and made dinner dire. Don't bother eating here unless your really tired and can't be bothered to go down to Orchard Roa

Went with a family of 5 to celebrate my boy's birthday. Have made the reservation for 4 persons weeks ahead and request for a slice of cake to surprise my boy. Last minute request to include one more person was accepted readily. The fish head curry was really signature. Good ambience and very pleasant service crew. Have a very memorable family gathering.

There were 7 of us for dinner. We thought there was Penang Food but that only happens occasionally. However, they had local Peranakan type dishes which we settled on. Top of the list was the Assam Fish Head, tangy and lots of ladies fingers. It was a whole fish but still we wanted more. The beef rendang, black ink sotong and kangkung were good too. The chap chye was very sad looking although it tasted OK, and the assam prawns was also a disappointment. For dessert I had a chendol and was happy with the texture of the green noodles, the red beans were nice and whole (not azuki) but the local ones, plenty of fresh santan and finely shaved ice. The taste was just right but it could do with a bit more gula melaka. All in all, it's another go-to place for a more than decent meal. Service was better the Ok and the restaurant though not attractive was quiet and spacious

Spread is a bit more than simple, but cold. Egg station - you don't get to chose the ingredients in your omelette from the fierce aunty. Slow in replenish even though I was there 8am plus. Cappuccino was bad.

Very good food and service at this cafe. I tried the Beef Rendang which was delicious. I thought the food was reasonably priced but the drinks were expensive. Although pricey, this cafe makes great milk shakes and I think their hot chocolates are amazing.

This restaurant had great food, great service and is very reasonably priced. If staying at the York then book the breakfast at reception on arrival as this will save you money.

We were staying across the road and decided to try this restaurant but we were very disappointed. We ordered our dinner and mine arrived almost straight away. My husbands did not arrive for quite some time afterwards. The food was very ordinary.

Decided to go to WRC and have lunch with my family. It was a long walk from the main road. Which is might as well, since I get to burn more calories before eating.If you are ordering from the a la carte buffet, you just write the quantities on the order form for the dishes you want. It's unlimited servings, except for the fish head curry. I find the portion for fish head curry to be generous. It was also delicious.Many wonderful dishes in the buffet. I like the silvee fish omelette, onion omelette, black ink sotong, sambal kang kong, and the stir fry bean sprouts. The best part for my family, especially children, is the dessert. Ice kacang, chendol, cheng teng are just some of them.For $29 per adult, this is worth the price! Should try if you want to taste good Singaporean food

Beef rendang, fish head curry, black ink sotong, chap chye, silver fish omelette and so much more. All served as you order and the only limit is your tummy! Watch the chef through the glass panel and that will further increase the enjoyment. It's very reasonably priced so great value for a satisfying meal but it's a well kept secret because the restaurant was less than half full for a Sunday lunch. Service was friendly and helpful.

A large group of us had lunch here today. The reservation process was helpful, efficient and friendly. We were greeted by Mr Ramly who led us to our table and he was a great host throughout the meal. Superb service which left us with a deep impression. Executive Chef Charlie Tham also smiled and waved to us from the show kitchen! The food was served quickly and every (and I mean every) need was well anticipated by the service team. Recommendations for what to order were on point, and the food was delightfully tasty, especially the fish head curry. Very appetizing. Definitely worth a visit

I spoke briefly of the food available at the White Rose Cafe in my review of the York Hotel so I will elaborate a bit more here.Our first encounter with the food here was at the lunchtime buffet .. we went in and the waiter come over and asked us to tick our selections on a form ... usually at a buffet, you go and help yourself but here you select what you want on the form and they bring it to your table. We didn't tick the fish head curry and the waiter said "you must tick" .. we said "no thanks" and he insisted "it's free, you must tick" so we did ... wow ... best curry we have had for a long time ... what a surprise so if they insist, go for it.This was part of the Treasured Flavours of SingaporeThe rest of the buffet items were also great and included Black Ink Sotong, Sambal Sotong, Stir Fried Spicy Clams, Onion Omlete, Chicken Masala, Beef Rendang, Chap Chye, Curry Cabbage, Sambal Kang Kong, Chendol and Ice Kachang ... and lots of others I can't remember with as much steamed fragrant rice as you want.The staff at the York Hotel are just great, friendly, efficient ... always smiling.Even if you aren't staying at the York, eat at this restaurant, you won't reget it (unless you have some sort of brain damage)

It has been a long time since I dined at white rose Cafe for their famous Penang food fare which happened thrice a year.As we are looking for a place to celebrate our aunt's birthday, and it coincides with the Penang food fare period, we decided to do it at white rose cafe.Some new items have been added to the penance food fare, it may have been added some time ago but it was my first time seeing them at the fare. They are the fishball Kway teow soup and the roti Babi. As for the rest of the items, they are still as good especially the char Kway teow and oyster omelette and lor bak. The Chendol is authentic as well.The best of it all is the service that goes with the Penang food fare. After so many years, the staff are still the same. Complements to Mr Ramli who always goes the extra mile to ensure that everyone is well taken care of. Though the coffee house is filled to the brim, never did we feel that there was a compromise in service standard. Kudos to Mr Ramli for his great hospitality. Met the chef, Mr Willie as well at the Penang food fare. He greeted us and was very helpful to explain the different dishes and the concept when it was first birth about 30 years ago. I believe not many chefs at hotels will actually "walk the ground" and ensure that the patrons are will taken care of and listen to any comments made by us. Great job chef Willie!Great event filled with simple yet fulfilling and tasty food, matched with great hospitality by the staff

We always come for the Penang Hawkers Fare, which the cafe has every 3-4 months. It brings to us the best of Penang street food without having to fly there, such as the char kway teow, Penang laksa, prawn mee, lor bak, ban chang kueh (peanut pancake), chendol, ice kachang!

Had a late lunch in White Rose Cafe when we stayed at the York Hotel. The staff serving us was really friendly and helpful. Service is quick and the food is average. No complaints though

They serves very good fish head curry.
Their Penang food fare is the best in Singapore.
I like their chicken pies a lot.
Recommended.

Staying at the York for a week, we visited the White Rose Restaurant on 4 occasions.One was to celebrate our 6 year old grand daughters birthday. The family came from Dubai & my husband I travelled from Australia. The service was good staff very friendly & helpful. Thank you for looking after us and making us feel welcome. Thanks for the chicken wing advice. Only order 2 per serve, but tasty!

Join their cooking class for penang food was given a $12 voucher, thought of try the fish noodle, but my friend want to try the curry fish head. So we order half a curry fish head with two rice.It was a quite aftetnoon, peaceful slowly tuck into our fish head was so pleasant. They serve with some cracker, we ask for more the staff said three pcs for $2 , told him if pay we don't want, he than whisper and said he try to get us some. Here he came with a plate that was a good gesture it make customers happy.Curry fish head was good with lots of vegetables we even order a take away. $28 for half a fish head fresh and tasty good value

It was surprisingly quiet here on a Friday night (normally we experience the bustle of the Penang hawker fare here). We were a party of three and we ordered like we were at a heartland "zichar" (ie local stall where you can get large variety of ala carte dishes). Pricing is very close to that of the heartland but with first class hotel service! It is good to have hotel associates who are able to advise you on the local dishes. A good way to introduce non Singaporean friends to our little red dot's cuisine. And the dishes were definitely of high standard

Very excitedly I have gathered 6 seniors to head down to my favourite White Rose Cafe on a Tuesday for lunch. There is this daily lunch ala carte menu Peranakan style buffet special per head at S$25.00++ but on every Tuesday, additional 10% discount for all seniors. Tempting range of dishes like black ink sotong; chap chye; sayor lodeh; fried chicken; beef rendang; chicken masala; sambal sotong; fried omelette; kang kong; fried taugeh with salted fish;achar ; ngoh hiang etc .. such an enticing spread.With a group of 4 and above, a dish of one full fish head curry will be served, once only. As for other dishes and rice, it is unlimited servings.We were looking forward to it since the chef who prepares the fish head supposedly comes from a reputable Chinese fish head restaurant which has ceased business. We were totally disappointed beyond words. We have ordered most of the dishes on the menu but non were tasty and it weren't Peranakan nor Cantonese style. Nothing was good and nothing worth mentioning. Equally disappointed with the service staff who served better before.For a good half an hour after we have settled our bill but weren't ready to leave yet, non of the service staff came forward to ask if any of us need more drinks: water.Initially, I had in mind to visit again with a few other groups of seniors but after this rather embarrassing lunch treat to all my other seniors, no way am I ever going to try the lunch special anymore

Only went to this cafe for breakfast. It was buffet and had a very good variety. When walking through at night, there was always a line to get into this restaurant and was always busy, so I would assume was good for dinner, but never personally ate there

Singaporeans rave about Penang food and they think nothing of flying up there to have their fill, chartering a taxi to take them all day to all of their favorite haunts featuring the best street foods. So when York hotel brings in a good cross section of the hawkers from Penang to cook in this cafe and charges only $25++ buffet style, it is a no brainer. My wife who was from Penang rated the food an 'A' after tasting the Char Kway Teow (not too oily and enough wok hei), Penang Laksa, Kway Teow Soup and the Ao Jian (Oyster Omelette). They come three times a year, March, September and December, 2 weeks each. The rest of the year they feature Flavours of Singapore buffet reviewed by others

This is the first time that my family and I have had a lunch buffet Ã  la carte. This means that you order food from the buffet menu and you get unlimited refill of small dishes. It took 30 minutes for the food to finally come out but worth it!! The food was DELICIOUS!!! We started off with a traditional Singaporean dish called Fish Head Curry. The curry was mild but the taste was savory. This was one of my favorite dishes. Everything was delicious!!! My kids (11, 8, and 5) also think the food was "really good"...they are a fan of chicken tikka masala

I wouldn't rush to eat breakfast at the White Rose Cafe. There are many other better options close by for a cheaper or similar price. Go to Paragon Shopping Centre to eat - much better.I don't know about lunch - apparently they are famous for fish head soup - which i like but after the breakfast i was put off trying it
