For newbies who adventurous maybe they can give this a try, Turtle Soup! If you are a party of 3, order the $50 one which shd be more than enough. The broth is thick n rich with spices, if you order mixed, you get a mixture of soft skin n meat. They hv white rice n yam rice so see yr preference. Chilli sauce, vinegar, light soya sauce n pepper are all provided. They do hv individual portion. And if not everyone is into turtle soup then try the brewed chicken soup. It is an acquired taste, if you like it then for sure you will be a regular here!

We arrived at the restaurant at around 11.15am on Sunday and the waiter promptly took down our orders. The crowd was already building up with individuals and families enjoying the various herbal soup including soft shell turtle and black chicken soup. The yam rice was fragrant with crispy shallots. The Chrysanthemum tea was authentic. I noticed that many of the patrons were regulars. My family of three enjoyed the meal very much at below S$90! Strongly recommend to those who enjoy herbal soup. Convenient parking just opposite the restaurant and along the road outside

My first try of the black herbal chicken soup and I would say that the restaurant was very generous with the herbs which give the soup the type of taste it should have. My expectation of such black herbal chicken soup is usually on the high side and frankly, I was expecting something better given the reputation and online review that I heard. Nonetheless decent, worth a try. Cost $13 a bowl but the portion of chicken you get is more than some of their competitors. Just a note that they have the white herbal chicken soup as well (taste a bit sweeter and a less herbal) but it sells out earlier, usually by noon.
