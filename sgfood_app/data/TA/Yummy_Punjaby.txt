Great Food, Excellent service.
We host regular get-togethers where all catering is from Yummy Punjaby. Our guests (of varying nationalities) have always complimented the food.
5
Ordered chat items from YP for catering. Received fantastic reception from whoever had the food. No hassles in negotiations as well.
5
Excellent dining experience. Nice ambience Ang great service. The roti was to die for. Plus other signature dishes.
Will definitely come back.

Authentic indian food. Best north indian food in the town.
The food was delicious and served in good quantity. The whole surrounding is north Indian and excellent variety of indian cousines.

I have eaten more delicious Indian food many times so I can’t say that here is good/best.
Prices are a bit expensive.
Atmosphere is ok.
5
Let me start with food. The best food I have ever eaten. I have eaten food for continuous three weeks. The quality of food is excellent. Hospitality is great. I am back in India and I still miss the food.
5
Love the vegetarian ghobi manchurian,vegetarian biryani and samosa!! My all time favourite whenever i visit this place..
Good food, good place !!
5
Mango lassi is a must try! Lovely ambiance and friendly staff. Healthy authentic indian food is hard to find.
5
IT WAS AMAZING!!!! We have been to so many restaurants in Singapore AND WE HATE ALL OF THEM EXPECT for yummy PUNJABIIIIII. It is simply amazing. Everything on the menu is great. We went there more than once. The service is outstanding and they make you feel just like family. Never been to such a welcoming restaurant. It feels just like home!!!! Thank you Yummy Punjaby for making feel at home! This was one of the best parts of traveling to Singapore

Reviewed this place last year with a cautious "shows promise" tag. Certainly much improved on this family visit. We shared four spicy dishes and rice and found them all good standard. Service was fine and overall looking like a successful Indian restaurant should. Keep up the good work
4
Very tasty chicken kardai and spinach paneer dish washed down with a large bottle of Kingfisher. The garlic naan wasn't the best, being too thin and greasy but apart from that a nice meal.
5
Excellent food and mouth watering dishes.
Delicious dishes and One can feel the real Panjaby flavour in the dishes. Wonderful location. Will strongly recommend to visit once and taste the food if you haven’t been to yummy Panjaby.
4
Good Indian food in Singapore. If you are done with seafood and wants to eat spicy one, then ho for it.
5
Recently we had an outdoor dinner with family and relatives from Zurich. They were very impressed with personalised service and great food. He promised to come back and try the Tandoori food again. Please keep up your quality and hope you will do better.
5
The food is good. Authentic Indian food with a nice vibe in the restaurant. I recommend the sizzlers.
5
Yummy Punjaby ...we visited n revisited while in Singapore for amazing food n hospitality. Must try their stuffed parathas . All the paneer preparations and dal take u closer to home . Best chefs and ever smiling staff is welcoming .
5
We ordered home delivered food from Yummy Punjaby on Diwali. Fantastic food and fast delivery. Spoke to Inderjeet at the restaurant and he went out of his way to deliver our special request which was out of the menu. I will not hesitate to recommend this restaurant for great Indian cuisine and professional service Thank you.
4
I visited this restaurant with my family waling as its nearby my son's home. We ordered Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian food. All the side dishes were upto the mark. The best plus point is its quick service. It is centrally located also. If one wants to relish Indian food, sure to try and enjoy
4
Whilst staying at Park Hotel Alexandra I happened across this hidden gem. Yummy Punjaby (Naff name) is a small restaurant tucked away near the entrance to the hotel car park. First impressions as a guy from England was the fact it was populated by native Indians, I was the only European in there. Good sign. The ice cold draft beet was a welcome refreshment whilst I ordered. The meal was a delight, fresh, full of flavor and authentic. We took the chicken tikka masala and mutton rogan josh, wonderful
5
Brilliant tasting food. Paneer wrap was amazing - the best I had to date. Preparation is nice and not too heavy which makes it easy to go back to Yummy Punjaby when feeling hungry. Great options for vegetarians. Excellent quality and great folks running the place. Kudos.
5
Yummy punjaby is the best food joint ever visisted......they serve delicious food . I become a big fan and insists my freinds to have a visit.
My kids enjoy the food as well.
5
The food is very tasty and good value for money. Highly recommend the tandoori chicken and reshmi kababs.
4
Just had a lunch here. Good ambience. Super courteous staff. Good north indian preparation. Not very hard at pocket. Wifi given. Play english music . Must play hindi/punjabi music that shall go with the theme. Good combos but only at selected time.
4
We have visited the Singapore in May 2017 and this is the only reason why we survive there. The only restaurant near our Hotel with Good and only Indian serving. The staff is also good. The service is excellent.
5
If you are looking for authentic Indian food, Yummy Punjaby is THE place. Delicious food, quick service and cordial staff...
5
The ambiance, the food & the quantity & quality was fantastic. Have been to other joints serving India cuisine, but this one was outstanding. Really liked the place & the very hospitable hosts. If you are an Asian, must visit.. must dine at Yummy Punjaby, when in Singapore 
5
This place is on top of my list for worthy Indian authentic food restaurants in Singapore. Have been a regular customer to this place for about a year mainly for its great ambiance, amazing food quality and service. A must visit restaurant for all the locals and visitors. Special mention for its Owner Mr. Indrajeet Singh who is great buddy for all its customers, he and his staff really takes good care
5
Great north indian punjaby food.Afgani murgtikka and soyachop, Dal tadka, Naan basket and Mutton briyani was the best, service is good but it can be more better
4
I liked the name so I planned to go there with my big group.The place is bit small.Service was good and food was also good. No complain or issues. Starters and main course was all good and no one in the group said anything negative.Little Pricy (mid to high) so group says that we may go some other place next time
5
Yummy Punjaby has one of the best Authentic Indian food in Singapore, just like the name, the food is Yummyyy too..! You definitely need to put this on your bucket list for your next visit here!The whole experience was mind blowing. Great service and the best combinations of food and drinks. Loved everything that I have tried in all my visits. Highly commendable place, go and pamper yourself and give soulful treat to your appetite
5
Had the peanut masala, palak paneer, butter chicken with 3 different types of naan, all were fantastic and service was attentive. Will go back again
3
A few of us ate here last week. They have good selection on their menu, service is fast, food is decent.
5
Good location and ambience. Authentic North Indian food. Completely worth the time and money. Must go for North Indian food lover.
5
The food served in this restaurant is absolutely sumptuous and very authentic Indian cuisine. The management and staff are very cordially, friendly and helpful.
I recommend this restaurant for Indian cuisine specially Punjabi food.
5
We visited here during our stay in Singapore and it proved to be one of the food highlights of the city. The menu is very impressive, which made choosing quite hard but we selected a number of dishes including Afghani chicken,Amritsari fish and Chilly chicken in starters..We also had Yummy kastoori chicken (highly recommended) in main course along with Dal Makhani - the food was amazing! My wife (being vegetarian) had Sarso ka Saag with Makki ki Roti..I don't know who invented Saag but it's among the best u get in Yummy Punjabi..I brought back lot of lovely memories from Singapore and my dinner at this restaurant is among those for sure.Wonder how they maintain that authentic taste of all those dishes precisely.Staff here very friendly and helpful, especially when we were unsure of a couple of items on the menu.Highly recommend tourists to reserve an evening for this place
5
We go to Yummy Punjaby very often and thoroughly enjoy their dishes. We love their masala peanuts, daal tarka and kadhi....the taste is authentic and is almost like home cooked food.Our friends who enjoy non vegetarian food have loved their Chicken Bullet....something that we have not seen in other Indian restaurants in Singapore. Staff is very attentive and friendly....a must try for those looking for authentic Punjabi food in Singapore
3
Ambiance: it was good enough, very typical. However, I have one major complaint. The music playing in the background was atrocious. If you have a penchant for Punjabi men serenading girls in miniskirts with terrible lyrics only then listen to the music.Food: We ordered butter naan, butter chicken, and biriyani. Naans were good. Butter chicken gravy was really good but there were only 5 tiny pieces of chicken. Biriyani was like a concentrated mush. Stick to naans and currys.Service: Quite good and prompt. However, one funny thing was that we saw the security guard having a beer on the job. Interesting. Just one small thing, we asked them for a table in the middle of the restaurant but they refused, saying it was reserved for a party of 5 or more. However no one else came. Could have given us the table.IIf you are really craving Indian food and this place is close to your house then go. Otherwise it isn't really worth it. Sadly I won't be returning
5
Food is amazingly tasty by all standards.Even more is the refreshingly pleasant manners of the staff. I was there during a busy weekend, so naturally it took some time for dishes to come, but the excellent attitude of the staff more than made for the delays.Great location as well, with not many Indian restaurants in the surrounding 4-5 km I guess
5
Best place to go for a dinner with Team, family and friends..Delicious food served in starters and main course. I precisely liked - Samosa, Pakoda, Aaloo / Gobi Paratha, Navratan Kurma and paneer Bt Masala :)Prices are also good !!I am a vegetarian and was able to get lots of options over there..Would definitely recommend this place for those who visit singapore.Nearest MRT is Redhill and then a bus directly to this place.

After reading all the good reviews we dropped in for dinner around 8.. the hotel was not crowded when we entered.. since we were two and with a baby they did not allocate the four chair tables which were free.. And asked us to wait for five minutes to prepare a table with two chairs and a Baby chair.. five min turned to ten n then 15 min.. I went to the counter to ask for the table by which time new customers came and they were being accommodated in the four chair tables.. This in itself was disappointing since with a baby in tow waiting time for more than five for just to get seated.. by the time we placed our order it was 30 min since we entered the restaurant.. We placed the order for soup, starter n main course. Thy gave the starter and main course together, forgot the soup.. when asked to cancel the soup after waiting for about 10 min they mentioned it is ready and will be served.. they served the soup after another 5 min. Now coz all this we weren't able to enjoy the food like we had planned.The food per se was good.. but definitely not worth waiting this long
5
I had dinner at Yummy Punjaby. The good was so authentic Punjabi and very yum! Service is exemplary. I really felt at home. Definitely going to come back every time I visit Singapore. Highly recommend!
4
My girlfriend and I frequent this establishment due to its delicious food and great services. I highly recommend this restaurant and also the mutton briyani.
5
Tasty food, good hospitality & value for money..
We have been quite regular to this joint & I would recommend this place to all..
5
The food is very very tasty, the quantity is good , service is excellent , ambience is good for a mid range restaurant . In short excellent value for money .
5
Eating paradise for north Indians who prefer mughlai food .Only place in Singapore where North Indian chefs makes Mughlai food .....Great ambience ,location and cheerful staff makes a must for us to come back again
5
Great food even though the staff seems different from the one they used to have in Pahang street It got rave reviews then it deserves rave reviews nowGobi manchurian and palak paneer are my all time favourites here Their stuffed parathas are not bad eitherMy recommendation would be to keep some time for this restaurant when you plan to visit IKEA Alexandra which is next door
4
I stumbled across this restaurant and pleased I did. The menu offerings are sensible and found to be well diversified to North Indian standards. The location is fairly easy to get too, however the restaurant interior is not really the best in the world, however I came for food on more than one occasion and liked the food.Flavors were good, food is well presented and served nice and hot and to a good standing. I have knocked a star of this review for the following reasons, service is not the best, as any service had to be stimulated by myself and perhaps lastly the cost. Its certainly not the worlds most expensive food, but its a touch higher priced then it perhaps needs to be in my opinion. With that said, been twice and shall be back again as the food remains highly recommendabl
5
Surprised pleasantly by this unassuming small restaurant in not so populated location in Singapore. A pleasant decor and casual atmosphere combined with very authentic punjabi food makes it unbeatable. All ingredients are sourced fresh and no frozen ingredients makes it tasty and healthy. The service at the table was excellent and overall i would come back to this restaurant
4
On a business trip to Singapore I ate at the Yummy Punjabi on more than one occasion and each time the food was fantastic, the background music was a little load for my liking but that was made up for by the fact that they serve pints of beer.
5
Fantastic Tandoori Rotis and great Dal! I love the fact one can sit outdoors and really enjoy a drink as well. I had dietary restrictions and the chef altered the dish to my liking as well - thank you! Will certainly be a regular. Staff are extremely friendly and they make sure you are well taken care of
5
Great atmosphere. Been there few times, every time the staff and chef has served the best! always on top of service and food quality.
5
We've been there a few times and the food is very good and the service is courteous and nice. The veggie stuff..Dal Tadka, Sarson ka Saag, Pakodas etc are excellent. A must visit place.
5
Serves probably the best Indian food in Singapore at reasonable prices...a must try destination for foodies...also offers wide range of meals
5
The restaurant serves super-tasty, authentic north indian food, and some indo-chinese dishes. The cost is average. A meal for 2 people would cost roughly 30 dollars without drinks.
5
Yummiest Indian food I had in Singapore. Authentic punjabi food. Soya chap masala is the best I have ever had. Must visit.
5
I've been staying in Singapore for past 3years and enjoying the food being served here. It was first located near Arab street and now shifted to alexandra central mall. Over the years the quality of food and their service has never disappointed me. Just love the Indo-Chinese cuisine. I would highly recommend this restaurant to people who are looking for some good Indian food. Reasonably priced. Recommendations: chicken tikka sizzler, butter chicken and chicken chow mein
3
After a leisurely, tummy-stuffing buffet breakfast at the Park Hotel, our grandsons decided they needed more food. We went to the Yummy Punjabi in the Alex Central Mall around 1.30pm. There was something funny going on with the staff who, although we were the only diners, seemed to have their minds on other things. Each time the waitress came to the table it was as though she had never seen us before. The boys had curries and Shirley Temples, and S and I had smaller dishes and lime juice. I had a tomato soup billed as "spicy" on the menu. It was sweet and straight out of a Heinz can.The wait staff were huddled at the Bukit Merah Road entrance and the manager and some visitors closeted near the door to the Mall. Neither group seemed very interested in the diners.I paid the bill and as I turned to leave the cashier called me back because he had forgotten to charge me for the drinks. Get your minds on the job ladies and gentlemen
4
Staying in Singapore for 3 weeks and this was my 3rd visit to the Yummy Punjaby I had a different dish each time and each one was excellent, if I stay in this part of Town the next time I am in Singapore I will definitely come back here
5
Home Food Away from Home..Thanks IJ's Yummy Punjaby for the lovely authentic North Indian Punjabi food.....Must try - Chole PeshawarI -veggies delight indeed, Chicken tikka masala was finger-licking good...The bread served had lots of choice n the best part they were freshly baked...n guess the biggest surprise was it was absolutely low on oil n spices yet had the richness of flavours will definitely be coming ever n ever n again......Highly recommended..

I am delighted to share the news that Yummy Punjaby North India Restaurant & Bar has a new location, new ambiance and expanded seating at 321 Alexandra Road, at the the Alexandra Central Mall in Singapore!The new design and ambiance of Yummy Punjabi emphasizes the rich colors or orange and yellow which are synonymous with spice and seasoning of Punjab and North India.The unique and tantalizing menu remains the same as the menu at the former location, which includes hand selected spices and seasoning by experienced and well-traveled Manager/Owner Inder Jit (IJ) Singh. This is an excellent choice to invite your clients, colleagues, friends or family when you are looking for a unique and creative dining experience in Singapore. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and I recommend arriving early for an aperitif, cocktail, wine or beer at the Yummy Punjaby Bar. Convenient to visit as adjacent to Yummy Punjabi is a taxi stand and SMRT bus stop.Congratulations and well-wishes to Yummy Punjaby on your new home in Singapore
5
This is one of the best places in Singapore for Indian food. I am quite a frequent visitor to this place and have never been disappointment. Apart from food, I think the location is perfect for family outing or a friends gathering.
5
Great place. Authentic punjabi food. Great location and fantastic staff! Highly recommended. Every thing on the menu is good. Been here a few times - the lamb briyani is one of the best I've had.
4
The food is definitely above average, but not that great, so Very Good is exaggeration and Average is under-estimation, they are definitely above average. Recommended to try, but Soups are must try. They make awesome Soups. Huzayf
5
I have eaten here twice this week im staying at the park royal hotel. Service is friendly and food is nice. Curry rice & starter & 2 beers for about $50
5
Good tasty authentic food, reasonably priced, quick friendly service.
A good range of menu items to choose from, including vegetarian.
Sit inside our outside, with plenty of drinks options.
4
In the vicinity of Arab Street, an authentic Indian Punjabi joint. Good ambience...Helpful staff and fairly priced food makes it a prefect mix for a weekend dinner with friends or family alike.
5
I would highly recommend Yummy Punjaby to anyone looking for an authentic Indian cuisine. I visited the place for the 5th time since learning about it last month.That's how addictive it is. Last visit, a friend of mine and I had buttered chicken paired with garlic naan and pineapple rayta. The combination was unbelievable. Very good texture & flavor with just enough amount of richness that would leave you craving for more! I'm actually salivating while typing!Hyderababdi Dum Biryani plus onion and tomato rayta is another perfect combination you should try! I should also mention that they serve the best saag and chicken tandoori! I can't wait for my next visit to try another dish! Thank you YP

That was so downgradation of your courtesy by you as we were 12 people, all were knowing the Singapore Standard time very well. That was sharp 10:20 pm when we reached there to order good food as per others reviews. Even you are saying that uptil 11pm you take orders, then what if it was 10:20? And if you cannot serve your walking customers then there is no need of you on Trip Advisor. Even after not getting a taxi, we ran 2kms to reach on time at your hotel, but very much dissatisfied.
1
After reading your restaurant reviews in trip advisor we group of 12 people decided to take dinner at your restaurant but on reaching your restaurant the owner refused to give table and gave reason that they were out of time but in trip advisor the timing of restaurant is OPEN TILL11:00PM, so it is requested to owner of the restaurant to change their timing in trip advisor to 10:30PM from 11:00PM. Please never do this to anyone again and value your customers.
1
Reached this hotel at 10:20PM but refused to give the table giving reason that they were short of food. We went to this place from review of trip advisor but we were very disappointed
1
The food was average and portion really small. I had two small pieces of chicken (size of golf ball). Then the guy even gave me less money back.. Rip off place!
5
This is our favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore, consistently tasty, delicious vegetarian curry. We have also experienced their delivery service which is also great. Highly recommend this restaurant for affordable cost and good customer service.
3
The food was good, little costly, but their service is poor. We waited for more than 30 mins for just daal and roti.
5
I have been to Yummy Panjabi few times and also have offered home delivery few times. Every time food quality was excellent and food delivery was quick. Restaurant staffs are very polite and nice.
Rating - 5 out of 5
5
Wonderful experience in Singapore really nice tasty food. must try Navratan Korma and butter naan with special green salad and hara bara kabab.
5
We wanted to have Punjabi food for lunch near to Bugis. Ordered Aloo Parata and other vegetarian dishes. Enjoyed the food, really tasty food. Highly recommended.
4
Goos punjabi food. The dalmakahni and Breads were good. The vegetable curry was also good. Good for casual eat out .
3
I was staying nearby so chose restaurant based on reviews and proximity of restaurant. I did not think that the curry had that strong a taste (Goscht Rogangosht - mutton curry). Naan cam out quite burnt but kuchumber salad was nice. Staff were friendly and the beer was cold! I think there are better choices in the area and so will not be rushing back here
5
The food was excellent ,tasty fresh. No heart burn or any other adverse effects.A very good dining experienc
4
We had been multiple times here. USP is the location, Bollywood songs, spicy food to our taste and cool breezy experience if you sit outside.The food is good. Menu spread is good enough. Yesterday we ordered Sarson ka saag as an experiment along with other stuff, and trust me, I wasn't that sure while ordering but it was finger licking to say the least. Samosa Chaat is a must is starter, though Panner Tikka was a little disappointing as it had more of Tomota, Onion and Capsicum slices as compared to Paneer slices.Ambiance is a bit contemporary, low frill.The service could be improved, few of them can be just trained a bit.This is a good casual dining place if you happen to roam around MBS area and want to have good Indian food
4
Simple Indian food. Naan particularly lovely. Good grilled meat and rice. Lots of Indians in there which has to be good!
5
Being confused by time zone changes we found ourselves wanting some "lunch" at about 3pm in the Arab Quarter and Yummy Punjaby came to our aid. We had onion bhaji, paneer shashlick and then dhall makhani and bread (roti/naan). The portions were large, the price modest and the staff helpful
2
I visited Yummy Punjaby on the 24-Sep in the evening. I had read good reviews on TA and other websites about this place and was very excited to try the food here. There was lot of haze in Singapore on the day we visited and when we reached the restaurant wearing our N95 masks- we realised there was no aircon. A disinterested waiter came to us with menu card.We enquired about the aircon - to which he said there is no aircon in the restaurant. I showed him the 2 aircon units right above his head to which he said- they are not working and the A/c repair staff has been called but is yet to arrive. There is a happy hour display on their website from 4PM -8PM as well in the dining area. I checked with the waiter and he told me there is no happy hour.When I mentioned that there is one on the website - he says there is happy hour but not today as it is a public holiday! (no where was it mentioned that happy hour is not applicable on public holidays).We are vegetarians and we only have non spicy food. We told him that and asked him for a dal and paneer gravy suggestion- He suggested us dal makhani & shahi paneer. We ordered both the items and they were very spicy. We asked him to replace the paneer . This is when another lady intervenes and tells us that we should have ordered some XX paneer gravy if we wanted something non spicy. How were we supposed to know which gravy to order - when their own staff had no idea??? We insisted that they replace the vegetable as it was not our mistake - they unwillingly agreed to it. The food was pretty average overall.The bigger issue was service - The staff was more interested in staring at a group of young college kids sitting outside than serve us. I had to literally stand and wave my hand/ walk upto the staff everytime I needed to order or request them to serve water. The other staff a guy and a lady were standing at the restaurant door and discussing 'life issues' may be - with their backs facing us and they too weren't approachable. In the end we walked out of the restaurant promising to ourselves that we would not eat at this restaurant again and also not let people who we know eat here ever
4
Authentic Indian food. If you're a calorie watcher then this place is not for you. Good selection of North Indian cuisine
4
If you wish to have yummy punjabi food, do visit the place. As the name suggests it is indeed yummy. You might feel its a little expensive, but the food is worth the mone
5
This is a wonderful and affordable place t eat great Indian food. from the food to the people working there all know Hindi and Punjabi. So if you get bored of Chinese in your visit come here for authentic orders in Punjabi . Must visit for vegetarians who do not get anything to eat in Singapore
4
Good place to have yummy parathas served hot from the oven. Veg raita is good too and the accompaniments, green chutney and date chutney were tasty too
5
We are were staying near Bugis for our family vacation in Singapore. I learned from Tripadvisor that this restaurant is very near to our hotel and is ranked in the top 100 out of the 7000 restaurants in Singapore, so must be special. And Tripadvisor was bang on target like almost always. We ate here almost everyday of our 10 day stay in Singapore and every meal was worth it...Authentic North Indian flavours...We ate a number of dishes...Lemme write down as many as I can remember :-)Dal Makhani.......truly yummyyyDum Aloo, Palak paneer...Mix vegetable...Aloo pyaaz parantha...gobhi parantha...Veg biryani....salad...raita...and on and on....everything great...We didn't try non-veg food, but I'm sure it must be as good since Veg was awesome.The table service is quick and delivery too. We ordered once at the hotel and the food came to our hotel in flat 20 min.Location is great too....10 min walk from Bugis MRT...Its open till 11 PM, this is big plus since you do tend to get late at times for dinner. A lot of other restaurants shut down around 9:30PM.Mr. Inderjeet and his team is extremely hospitable. We infact discussed our travel itinerary with him and his suggestions were extremely valuable. We had long chats over dinner...Must recommended for everybody who miss home food (and taste) plus all those who want to get a taste of India in Singapore... !!!
5
A must go hotel..Very good service and the owner takes care of ur food and needs ..Very very tasty food and Indians would love this hotel.. I think it's best restaurant I visited in Singapore
5
We ordered paneer lababdar.wanted to see if the paneer were as soft as in india and it indeed was. Then we had egg fried rice which was very good too.The mango lassi was somewhat watery.but overall nice and decent restaurant
5
Yummy Punjaby offered very tasty punjaby food.must try Aalto paranthas.
Kulfi is yum here.very quick service.very friendly Indian staff.
Food is served piping hot.
One must go to yummy Punjaby.
Will give 10/10.
5
A must visit restaurant.Very tasty North Indian food. One should try Aaloo Parantha.Very good service and excellent staff.
5
We live 200 meters from this restaurant and keep going back!! There are around 200 places to eat in the immediate vicinity and this is definitely in our top 5! Must try their Garlic Naan dipped in their Chicken Tikka Masala and Prawn Kadai
5
Excellent food that makes you feel at home. Authentic North Indian Food near Arab Street..... Recommended for both Vegetarian & Non Vegetarian foodie
4
The food is delicious made with lots of passion. My compliment goes to the master chef of this establishment in carefully choosing the ingredients for the recipes and making it the most delicious Indian curries and rotis. Although the chassis could be a little less watery and severed without ice. It's located in a corner of a residential area. You enjoy the food minus the unnecessary formalities of a hotel or mall restaurant
4
This place serves amazing food.. Reasonable price. Especially if you are looking for Indian vegetarian food near bugis.. This is best
5
The food was simple and great.. the service was quite fast.Would definitely go again and highly recommend others
5
We have heard great things about YP from friends in Dubai and India. We were not disappointed! Tasty home cooked North Indian food cooked with passion and served by a friendly team in a casual and relaxed ambience. We will be back
5
Hi to all my friends in Yummy Punjabi, I am happy to be part of your group there. Yummy Punjabi made to survive in Singapore for two months by providing a best food which feels like home food. I suggest to reviewers to taste Allo Dum both in Curry and starters. Food is really worthy for paying and is affordable in Singapore Market
4
The food here is first class. Fantastic garlic nan brads and dhal. Can't say more, a great feed. The beer was good too. Great Tiger on draft and Kingfisher in large bottles. All in all a great experience. Staff where friendly and attentive and the price was right
4
Visited there with Friends for a party. An amazing place with good quality food, wonderful ambience, Must visit for Indians missing home food especially North Indian Food. Located near the bugis mrt at beach road. Drinks are also available.
5
Delicious Food, An Heavenly Treat for Indians and Continental food is really suits all customer needs.
5
We had an excellent meal with very attentive service, the dishes we ordered were all of a high standard. The location and venue had a good atmosphere.
4
Authentic homely meals at affordable pricing.
Convenient location although parking may be an issue during peak hours.
5
Great food, great service. Wonderful people!!
Traditional Indian food, Indian Chinese... Some of the dishes taste better here than I've had back in India.
It's refreshing to experience this away from home.
5
Very good Indian food. Super friendly and service minded staff. I don't like garlic so they prepared my food especially without it. Had a Chicken Tikka Massala and it was delicious. Right amount of spicy and very tender chicken. Relaxed atmosphere in a calm neighbourhood, outside tables but covered by an overhanging roof. Try it
4
Yummy Punjaby @ 2 Pahang St, Little India, is a delight. It may be small and the decor basic, but the food is first class. There is a large menu to choose from. We let the owner/chef recommend our meals as he knows what he cooks best. He didn't disappoint as we loved all the dishes he served us. Throw in complimentary drinks and the value is amongst the best in Singapore. Would definitely go back there
5
We have been frequenting this place the last two years or so and now I am finally doing a review! A quiet place next to the happening Arab street! Their starters and soups are to die for.. Must try their sizzlers and hot and sour chicken soup! The mains are good too.. Good north Indian food but if you are a south indian so used to south biriyani's - may be biriyani's are not your choice of staple here.. Their jeera rice, Chinese selections and masala papad are my 9 year old's favorites!! Overall its a cosy nice place with nice food, homely ambience and service!

So we got off the MRT, and were headed towards Bugis, to pick up some stuff for back home, my friend who was Punjabi, overheard a girl having a conversation in Punjabi, after walking a few steps he figured he'd ask her about advice on a good Punjabi restaurant, she got up delighted and handed out a flier, of yummy Punjaby, and offered to take us there, post our shopping, we found directions to the place, which was a little difficult but finally got there.We were greeted well, and got a nice place to sit outside. and ordered a few of their best things on the menu.and we were certainly pleased, if you are going to Singapore with your family / friends this is definitely the best North Indian food you will get in Singapore. A delight really. we ended it with a shikanji. the meal was fabulous, to really top-up the experience they gave us a 10% discount, which the girl with the flier had suggested which was well totally unexpected

YP is simple, and simply brilliant. Understated, they have good wholesome hearty food, that is apparently being made with some level of love/ passion that goes missing in kitchens of even 5 star hotels. I compare this to the Indian food I ate just one day back at Radisson Blu in Chennai, which is also home to The Great Kebab Factory. Radisson's food was average at most, and simply high on chilly to compensate for taste probably, and this is while being in India. Now to YP - food much better - leagues above - and this is saying a lot, considering being in Singapore. The chicken sizzler was awesome, and a simple thing like the Tandoori Roti was perfect - something most restaurants foul up on Ambience wise they aren't much, but food is another thingOne last thing is the attitude of the staff - very nice indeed. I will just hope they keep it up, so people like me can keep going ! Great work guys

We came across this little gem on the day of our departure from Singapore. The restaurant was very quiet, which allowed us time to languish over the beautiful food presented to us. Make and effort and try Yummy Punjaby, you won't be disappointed.

We felt very relaxed, at home and energized with the ambiance. Freshly prepared food served friendly and with smile, made us want more of it. Our guests were highly impressed with the place and the experience. We highly recommend people to visit Yummy Punjabi.

This is a great place for lunch or even dinner if you are near the Arab Street area. Very casual, consistently excellent food and the price is right. This is a place enjoyed by my Indian and non-Indian friends alike. What is also impressive is their extensive menu which includes tons of vegetarian and non-veg options. At lunch the set menu is very generous and is served very quickly, making it a great place for a workday lunch. The only watch out is the bathroom is pretty awful! Other than that, I highly recommend yummy punjabi if you are looking for a casual Indian meal

We were happily surprised by the attentive staff, delicious food and how neat and clean the restaurant was. A friend had recommended Yummy Punjaby saying it was delicious Indian street food. We sat at an outside table on the sidewalk (maybe why my friend called it "street food") and ordered a good array of meat and veg dishes. Each was tasty and flavorful. We will definitely return and bring friends!

Fantastic little restaurant with a friendly and relaxed vibe. I was in Singapore last month for a very hectic week-long trip. I used to be really exhausted at the end of each day, and all I wanted was comfort food. Yummy Punjaby was just a short walk from the hotel I was staying at, so I had my dinner there almost everyday. Really delicious food - I enjoyed pretty much everything I ordered. And the proprietor and the staff are all very friendly and warm. If you're going in the afternoon, you might want to try the set meal - I had that once and it was great

I am exceptionally fond of North Indian cuisine, especially the cuisine and culture of the Punjab region of India, which I first learned about in the excellent novel entitled The Far Pavilions, by M. Kaye. I was surprised to find during a walk in my neighborhood of Beach Road, Arab Street and Sultan Mosque, a delightful and colorful sign of Yummy Punjaby. This charming corner location offers indoor/outdoor seating and my guest and I were graciously welcomed and seated upon our spontaneous arrival.I prefer to learn and experience the unique dishes of every restaurant and upon inquiry, was recommended the combination of Sarson Saag, Chicken Tikka Masla, Jeera Rice and Garlic and Butter Naans.This is a delicious combination for the taste buds of two people who enjoy sharing spicy and savory dishes. We originally ordered only garlic naan but our taste buds and curiosity led us to order the butter naan.The ambiance and colorful lighting are charming and as American and Vietnamese guests in the restaurant, we felt we experienced a multi-sensory experience of Pubjab hospitality and cuisine. The service was exceptionally helpful, kind and considerate and we were surprised to find an email thanking us for our visit in less than 24 hours from our visit.The next time someone in your family, or a friend mentions Indian cuisine, surprise them with a gem of North India cuisine a the Yummy Punjaby!My Vietnamese guest and I look forward to our next visit already

A good choice for tasty Indian cuisine with super friendly service. Visited with family group of 5. Cost less than S$100 including 3 beers, mango yoghurt drink and more food than we could eat.
4
Good food, without having to worry about cost. Economical set lunches in town . value for money.
Order was taken promptly and served efficiently. We were 4 and we all enjoyed.
Keep it up.

Finally found a yummy north indian food place in Singapore. Great food and Cool Area by Arab Street. Loved it.
5
Thanks for amazing... We got to have the food after days.. It was nice and North Indian style with papas...... Thanks a lovely food.
5
The best paneer parathas and paneer tikkas I have had in Singapore thus far.
Great value for money food.
And the host is soooooo charming, went out of the way to give us a great experience !

If you are in the area it is worth the visit. Obviously a little more expensive than the Indian food in the middle of little India however the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly so worth the money. Still much cheaper than eating back home, we had 5 people with 5 main meals, a basket of mixed breads and drinks for under SGD $100. While you are there take a walk around the streets surrounding it
5
Had a dinner with a group of seven friends and we all loved the food! We came here once before and this is the reason to why invited tso many people to join us there for another delicious dinner. We sat outside and the personnel were really nice - it was really great. Will definitely be back for more of this fantastic food

Stumbled upon this restaurant late at night in the Arab district of Singapore. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices. Don't be put off by the outside appearance of the place, because the food is definitely worth it. You must try the dal makhani. It was the best and most memorable part of the meal
3
Had a group dinner here. Service took a long while. Rather cramped seating.Food was just about OK. More Meat friendly than Vegetarian I guess.Well the one good thing is the Price is not V High. Apart from that nothing much to write home abou

We were on business trip and working close to this restaurant. We worked at Concourse on beach road. I am a vegetarian so choice of veg food in this area was limited. The other choice i had was subway and pizza hut. This restaurant has limited place to sit inside and has outside seating too. They have set menu and can be upgraded with a drink. Everyday a different dish of set menu is available or you may order from the menu. Food taste is from average to good. We had lunch there on multiple occasions. Sometimes its difficult to work after a heavy lunch. Overall i would recommend this restaurant for a quick indian lunch. Food is not bad
3
We use to visit this restaurant during our lunch hours, but the I found that the restaurant is Too expensive when compared with food quality and quantity, you rather try a foodcourt meal.
4
Cool environment, with several seating options (inside and outside). Didn't try any food, but the coffee and tea was okay. Prices are a bit high for what you get

After reading positive reviews me and my husband decided to try Yummy Punjaby. Set up is not like restaurant its more like a cafe. Unimpressed with service. We had fish tikka sizzler. Its not at all a sizzler. Sizzler suppose to have some sauce with some assorted veggies. But, it was just nice fish tikka with salad. So, if you have ever tried indian sizzlers this would be a disappointment. Though, fish tikka itself was not bad. Panner tikka was too dry and average taste. Tandoori stuffed pranthas were better then main course or starters. For just an average food yummy punjaby is pricey. Not a worst indian food i had just, average
4
Good food as well good price. Service guy was new but still ok as trying his best for service. We love the food as chat , curry everything was so good. spent around 60$ for two person but had really good food with lots of variety. If looking for good food with reasonable price its a best place to visit.

Went with my family while in Singapore, staff have no people skills and no professionalism. Food was tasty but Customer Service was really bad. Plates were taken out of a cupboard and handed to us, with specs of dust on it. Beer was warm, no water was offered with meal either. Even if food was free here, highly doubt we would ever go

Walking around the Arab Street neighborhood at lunch time, I came across this Punjabi cuisine restaurant. After seeing the Tripadvisor logo on the restaurant window and decided to try the place. Used to Punjabi cuisine at home, I should be able to do justice reviewing this regional food restaurant. The lunch special of the day -- Fish Do Piaza was well priced at $8 that came with Daal (masoor) as a side. Regular non-special dishes were in the 15-20 SGD range. The daal was a pass but the Fish Do Piaza was poorly done, gluey sticky curry with stale masala. None of the ingredients tasted fresh including the fish. Tasted more like leftover that was reheated or one of those desi dishes you can buy at your local grocery frozen food section. Desi Naan (whole wheat) though small pieces were ok. Maybe I got them on a bad day, but this restaurant is more like fast food grade than a fancier slightly upscale joint. Staff was friendly, but no experts on food. I would suggest to avoid curry type dishes based on one experience and try more of the fresher tandoori checken or lamb dishes

Might I say ... one of the best North Indian food places in town, authentic home cooked style . Very very light on the oil/ghee front and you are given the option to go ghee-less on some menu choices. The "sizzler" dishes, especially the fish and the paneer (cottage cheese) are must tries.We always come away feeling very satisfied but without the heaviness often associated with eating restaurant style Indian food
2
We visited Yummy Panjaby based on the various positive reviews on this forum and had rather high expectations. However, the food was extremely oily and about average at best. We had the Aloo chat, Shahi Paneer, Bhindi do piaza, Aloo paratha, and Garlic naan. The flavours were not great and overall, we were rather disappointed. The one plus was that they had a good 1-1 offer on the wine, which was pretty nice. I would not go back
5
We ordered some vegetarian items, as all three of us were Veggies. When we placed the order, we were expecting normal taste, but when the food entered the taste buds, it was like OH MY GOD!!! Awesome Indian Veg food, in Singapore,??? I never had this tasty food even in Bangalore !!! It was simply AWESOME !!!Though it is not on the cheaper side, it is worth!!!Our Order:Palak PaneerMixed Veg CurryTandoor

Great food and lovely service, all at a decent price - especially for Singapore! Great vegetarian selection. Shared the veg app platter with a friend despite the servers warnings that it was far too much for two people (she was right! Its massive!) Looking forward to snacking on our delicious left overs

Good indian food with variety of kebabs... They organized a special valentine evening with wine,, chocolates.... Ambience is also very nice...
Close to Arab street and this is an advantage....

this is a small joint serving great indian food. There is option of set meals also.
Food is excellent. staff is courteous. a good experience.
4
last night in Singapore we dinner in here, we order chicken biryani, vegie biryani, pratha, naan butter and chicken curry butter, all have good taste until we order plain rice again, I wish can visit this place again if come back to Singapore
4
Tasty North Indian cuisine just around d corner where we were staying at 5footway.inn.. Not too expensive as well.. Worth d experience
5
The food here is simply brilliant. The food tastes exactly like what it tastes in North Indian restaurants in India. Best North Indian restaurant in Singapore
5
My co-workers and I eat here often for lunch. The food is good, fast and the wait staff is attentive and polite
5
We went last night on the recommendation of the concierge from our hotel. The service was very good, friendly and welcoming. The owner offered to help with any menu enquiries. We saw an adjoining table's starter arrive and realised the portions were large so we shared a starter of chicken pakora. Followed by rogan josh, butter chicken and dahl makni, all were faultless and very tasty. We had naans and bottled water and the bill was S$60 which we thought was good value. If you like North Indian food I don't think you will go wrong with choosing to eat here. Highly recommended
4
I didn't need much to eat, and wasn't drinking alcohol, therefore the restaurant wasn't going to make that much profit from me... but I was treated as well as any big spending customer might expect. My choices were fresh and very tasty, chosen with the help of the friendly waitress.The menu is extensive and reasonably priced; so when I am next in Singapore I will venture back hopefully with a bigger appetite.For the record, my dahl and freshly made roti were exquisite. And the lime soda just perfect.Thank you
5
My boyfriend and I often go back to Yummy Punjaby as the food is great and really reasonably priced. The staff are really friendly and the portions are generous. They even have a happy hour offer on glasses of wine before 8pm which keeps the cost low.The restaurant is on the corner of a street and the ambience isnâ€™t romantic or upmarket by any means so not the right place for a special meal, but perfect for delicious food and good value for money
4
The food was probably the best we had in Singapore, most authentic North Indian food we had perhaps. We were not staying anywhere close to this restaurant but I had read reviews about this here hence while coming back from Marina Bay Sands on our last night I thought of visiting Yummy Punjaby once and it was bit of a struggle locating this restaurant as its in a fairly quiet area off the main road. The food was surely the yummiest and pricing was very reasonable, however the service was bit too slow for my liking but I think if you are up for good food you won't mind waiting afterall :
