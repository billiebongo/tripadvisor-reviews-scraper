First time trying the ham sandwich, the look of it seems nothing much. But after eating it taste better than it looks. My Fren tried the spicy tuna sandwich instead, he loves it. Will try out other bread for sure!

Bakery is probably an extravagant description - it is just a bread/cake shop in the food court, but the danishes and cannolis are much nicer than the average Singaporean bakery, and cheap at about 2 bucks each.

I was recommended to visit Pecks bakery which is situated at the basement of the Takashimaya mall. This is at the end of the food court so quite a trek to get there. The bakery is Italian and we ordered a sausage bread and bought a pack of fresh spaghetti to cook later. A little of the pricier side

Besides the famous Takashimaya food court, are two bakeries-one of which is the famous PECK. Here, bakers bake fresh made bread and they come in a wide range of whole grain bread, ciabiatta, white bread, mini pizzas, croissants, danish pastries and custards. My personal favourite is Pugliese bread

This is the one of the best bakery in Singapore yet not many local come here.It is very strange because they provide one of the most artisan style bakery than many other fake bakeries around Singapore.Since they are not so popular, each items are less expensive than others considering the effort and quality of the products.I hope they open more shops around the Singapore so they can spread real bakery culture and taste in Singapore
