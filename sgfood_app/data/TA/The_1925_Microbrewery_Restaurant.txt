Nice little cozy brewery. Serves a good variety of craft beer from the other breweries as well. Reasonable price as well
5
Came back again because the food was good. Pretty sad the Lager were not available tonight. Must tries are their Asparagus, Chicken Skin, Truffle Fries
5
Mega loves for their double party chargrilled burger that was juicy-ily and cheesily good!!! Truffle fries were great too
5
You can have good quality of beer and they have happy hour from 10 to 12. Highly recommend to try after your trip around Singapore.
4
Mains were good, beers were better. ;-) Tried the yellow van and general during our visit and would recommend it.
4
The restaurant has many good food options and craft beers. Environment is slightly noisy but bearable.
4
Dreamt of Mr lobah lobah for days after.. fantastic food.. handmade pasta and curry chicken skin are really good too.. great place to enjoy beers with food.
2
Service was rude and unhelpful- food was ok, definitely not great. Beer selection only included 3 in- house brews
4
Food was great, and they all went well with the beer. The duck pasta was bland though - would be really nice if it had more flavour.
5
My husband and I stumbled upon this great little pub while we were making a mad dash from the rain! We had the tasting paddle with five different beers. It was a great option when you're spoilt for choice!Highly recommend popping in here for a drink or 5
4
Excellent service, great juicy beef burger, duck confetti pasta was underwhelming, but crispy and fat truffle fries made up for it!!
3
Staff was not very friendly or flexible. The Pork burger is very good and the portions are huge. Value for money. The beers are rather strong and value for money too. Ambience in the restaurant was ok. Good for group outing
4
Good place to hang out after work for a pint or two. Appetisers are great complements to the beer. Definitely recommended.
4
Although we were there early our first two choices of the menu were not available which was a little bit disappointing. But the food we took instead was nice anyway.
4
They had a good selection of home brewed beers that was unique and delicious.
We also ordered 4 dishes (2 burgers, curry fries, poulet) and the best was their poulet--soft and tender on the inside with a crispy skin.
4
Would definitely recommend the pulled pork burger. The sauce used for pork was well marinated, and the burger also made apple slices to make it refreshing. We also ordered the smoked duck fettucine which was okay and the skewed brussel sprouts, which was a little too hard for my liking. Didnt managed to try their beers this time. Definitely next time!

We visited the 1925 Brewery last night and the experience was far from what we expected.First off, we came here for the beer and I should mention that it wasn't bad at all, we tried the full range but settled on the yellow van for the bulk of the evening. We also ordered some bar bites that were very good so this 2 star rating is not directed towards the beer or the food specifically, rather, the front of house team themselves.1. It seemed that we had stumbled into their own social club, the waiters and waitresses were drinking shots with a couple of tables of guests and the end result was that it was almost impossible to get orders placed.2. One member of our group asked if he could have some bread and olive oil and the waiter refused. We asked if the kitchen had bread and olive oil and he confirmed that they did but that we couldn't order this as it wasn't on the menu.3. We promptly decided to leave and when raising these issues to another waitress and confirmed that we and everyone we know will never return she didn't seem to care and no solutions were proposed or suggested. Disappointing and completely careless.We should have known that there was no focus on the customer when, at one stage, one of the waiters asked everyone in the restaurant to stop talking and to sing happy birthday for one of the waitresses. We were paying guests who were not there to focus on the front of house, I remember singing and clapping my hands just wondering when my beer was actually going to emerge...Given they are charging SGD 15++ per pint from a location that is not exactly central they need to be going the extra mile to delight their customers. I would have spent twice as much last night and probably returned with larger groups in the future if the team could just take a moment to stop enjoying themselves and to focus on the customer. The end result is that they are essentially hemorrhaging money and pushing guests away but I doubt that anyone at the 1925 Microbrewery will really care until it is far too late
4
Tiny bar by the road. Came here because of the entertainer voucher bus was pleasantly surprised to find it almost full on a weekday. Ordered the smoked duck fettuccine and the beef burger. Both were awesome! Had the lemonade too but that was a little too sour for my liking.Very good value with the entertainer vouchers
4
I popped along to this bar for a Canadian Day, Canadian beer event and I was impressed with the ambience of this bar. It looks and feels exactly how I expect a craft beer pub should be. The staff were very professional, and they kept their cool even when dealing with very needy or bossy customers. I didn't try the food, the the meals were well presented and properly plated and the portions were of a generous size. They had a good range of beers on tap, and a decent amount of spirits if you want something stronger. The only suggestion that I would make is that they need to make sure the lighter beers, like pilsners are properly chilled. But other than that, I would stongly recommend coming into this bar if you are ever in Singapore
4
Small and cosy, with sufficient & comfortable walking and seating space. Partner had their house beers and mentioned that they were really good! We had the curry chicken skin and fried chicken, honestly don't think it's worth the money, but the mains (catch of the day Salmon and chicken) were well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service staff were attentive and always made us feel welcome. Certainly will visit again!
5
Went for a brunch on Sunday morning and the place is quiet, which is exactly what we are looking for. The 1925 breakfast and pizza are good. Will try the burger and mushroom soup next time if heir available.
4
Delicious. Friendly and attentive service. Pork belly rice with portobello and egg yolk - 5 stars. The choice of beers was the highlight- from light to dark and all at reasonable prices.
4
Chic place with an industrial look located in an old central neighbourhood shophouse, good for beers and burgers.
4
Best beef burger I have ever had, anywhere. Not greasy but juicy and peppery. Can still taste the meat. Fries equally perfect. Service could have been better. Had to look for staff even thoughthe small bar was half empty and at least 4 patrons on duty. Venue is relaxed and rustic. Pricing reasonable
4
Really nice brewery bar. Their actual brewing operation is quite small so there were only 2 of their own beers on offer but they have a number of guest taps so there is definitely a good range to drink through.Nice bar to sit at for a few pints when escaping the heat!Keep an eye on their specials as some, especially the free pour Sunday offer look pretty reasonable.
4
Came by here before Druggists. Wanted to stay here as the prices were great, and the guys working the bar were friendly and fun.They have great deals, such as when we arrived on a Sunday to the start of Happy Hour. It's also around $50 or so for all you can drink on Sundays too! If only I didn't have a flight to catch...Food was OK, got the smoked duck pizza. Nothing special, I think it could do away with the olives, as that was the overpowering flavour and couldn't taste the duck, which the pizza is named after.Beers were great, got a few light beers but want to try some of the heavier ones next time. Will be back 
2
the interior was interesting but service wasn't really good. staffs standing around chatting away. ordered pasta but the waitress gave us forks and knives. food wasn't the best.
4
The place is located in an old shop house on Jalan Basar and looks good from outside. The inside can be described as distressed industrial with unfinished walls , rough wood holding up the bar counter and metal angle used to make the tables. Fine dining it ain't but I love it! The place brews a couple of its own beers and the range is then supplemented with imported craft beer from U.K. and Australia.There is a good food menu from snacks to encourage more beer drinking (try the crispy chicken skins) or something more substantial to soak it up
3
Booked for 30 plus people for drinks and snacks. Pre dinner supposedly. Because the group was the size we were, we were put upstairs. An area with tables and chairs. And we wanted drinks and snacks.Asked to move downstairs to the bar but was refused the request. We arrived just after 6pm and it took an hour for the first few drinks to arrive. It was exasperating trying to push the wait staff to deliver. They seemed kind and I guess they were dependant on the bar to deliver to them. But it just wasn't happening. Ordered a selection of snacks of which the truffled fries arrived first, before any drinks were served. So drinks and snacks before dinner turned into drinks and snacks during dinner time. Leaving around 9:30 /10:00pm. All rather disappointing really; especially considering the total bill I had to pay in the end..
5
Based on a recommendation from a friend, this unassuming place serves up a pretty mean brunch. It is a bit of a limited menu for brunch, but definitely tasty!!I had the french toast with agave and berries! YUM - it was perfect, not overcooked, not too sweet and the tartness of the berries were great! On our table was also the deep-fried poached egg on portobello which was delicious too, and also the beef dish - which was supposed to be served in a hollowed out loaf of bread, but wasn't...we were after the 'flare-factor' - nonetheless, it was also very good!This place is definitely worth checking out, even if it is a bit out of the Singapore's centre, we found the closest MRT was Farrer Park, it's about a 10 minute walk away.
3
it is a nice one and next door is the bakery and breakfast place so it has a courtyard sitting shared and the bakery/eating place is decent also
4
The place is really set up as a bar with mainly bar stools.
It has specials for drinks throughout the week!
Food wise it was hit and miss.
King prawn pasta with pork floss. Prawn pesto pasta needed a little bit more salt.
5
Looking for a place to grab some food and friends suggested we head to this little brewery. Tried an IPA that they had and was great. They ordered the fish and chips and I opted for the burger.The burger was great. Very moist and juicy when you order it medium. The fish came out golden brown and still flakey to eat. So the cook did a great job. Food came to the table in a wood plank and just added to the atmosphere. From the outside you would never guess what is behind the doors. Great looking place, a brew pub that could be in any city back in the states.Easy walk from lavender station.
5
This brewery is located in the most unlikely place, on Jalan Besar. There is nothing before it on that road, and nothing after. If not for Tripadvisor, I'd have probably missed it. There are a few joints on the parallel road, on Tyrwhitt.  This came as a surprise, not only for its location, but also for the brews on offer. Mind you, it's not a lot, just 4 or 5, some from the US and some from the UK. But I've never had these brews before, and they were really good. There is one dry hopped variety which was exceptional. And also a wheat beer from Coronado, very good! The decor is also very interesting, in that that nothing additional has been done to modernise the decor. It gives you a long unused industrial feel, with minimalistic lighting. Both combined, it comes off easy on the eyes. Didn't try anything to eat, but they've got a fairly decent menu. If you're looking for a microbrewery in Singapore, this is one more to the growing list of them. You get a chance, and you're around that area, do drop by, it's definitely worth a visit!
5
 This micro brewery is a perfect place to have some very good draft beer , I tried a peach flavored beer with truffle flavored chips as a snack , the interior design is so cool with old layers of paint on the walls and simple steel and barn wood tables , really liked it
3
It was a department outing for brunch here. We had several orders of fries, the duck pizza which was nice but would taste better with hosin sauce, mushroom soup with faint hints of truffle, deep fried poached egg on portobello, the 1925 breakfast and special order of the beef steak with foie gras. Some hits and miss here but what's to our bewilderment was that they only had one beer available that day, which was rather unbefitting of a place that called itself a brewery
5
We used to live around the corner from 1925 and was our local, but now we've moved we still make the effort to head back there occasionally to see what beers they've got on offer and grab a bite to eat. They always have at least 5 beers on tap, with some brewed on the premises behind the bar, and others brought in from as far afield as NZ, UK and USA - some weve tried we've really liked, others not so much but that's half the fun in experimenting (and a half pint is cheaper than a full pint to get you trying new beers!)Friendly staff and good food too, but a bit out of the way and could be hard to find for the non-initiate
3
The beer scene in Asia is still in its infancy but I'm sure it is catching up. It was kinda dull during a weekday visit, with few patrons, and with some of the beers unavailable. Beer selection is meh compared to what I am familiar with even in small towns in N. America or Europe.
5
i really love the old industrial feeling of this restaurant. and it really cosy, had my proposal done here, the owner Mr Ivan is very accommodating and his staffs provide excellent service for my group of friends. it's also a wonderful place to chill out having craft beers and a affordable price
5
Came here with a friend for a few ales after work. Great atmosphere and great selection of beer. We tried several of the boutique beers on offer. Bizarrely one of my favourites was the Watermelon beer (never thought I'd hear myself say that!!) Food was very fresh and tasty. Would recommend the pulled pork burger. Definately worth a visit!
5
I love this place! Makes me feel like I'm back home in Europe:) Try theur pulled pork burger, so juicy, it melts in your mouth. The ambience is also nice, quite 'hipster'. I would definitely go back.
5
We live across the street and i did not know 1925 before. We tried it out for brunch and it s quite nice, cool set up and good value for money.
4
We stayed there for beer but end up eating there as well. Food was good. There are pasta, burgers and appetizers on the menu. They also brew own beer. This was a good value place.
4
Here you'll find half a dozen fresh beers on tap rather than a million different bottles in the bar fridge. As well as their own beers they have one or two guest beers on tap too. Apart from beer they have cocktails and a well curated selection of 3 red and 3 white wines by glass at a range of price points. Food menu was similarly focused on quality rather than quantity, with a relatively limited number of choices, but all of which looked delicious
5
The owners are very passionate about this place - and it shows. The small downstairs bar area was buzzing with people trying the craft beer or glass of wine. Upstairs is table seating for the casual dining restaurant. The food was simple but really tasty. It's located in an old shop-house that has been scrapped back to bare walls giving a slightly "warehouse" feel but also showing layers of history
3
We came to 1925 as my husband felt like having some beers and Burgers. I ordered a glass of red wine, which was quite obviously off. After inquiring as to when the bottle had been opened they told me 4 days ago. They did offer to replace the wine and I ordered a Italian which was better, but it also had been open a day or two. As for the food, we got an entree of fresh oysters which was lovely. For the mains, we ordered the pulled pork and the beef burger. The pulled pork was nice, juicy, though it was not overly filling. The Beer burger was a little dry, was very filling though it was lacking in something.......I will come back again, but I think I would skip on the wine, and perhaps try a different mains as some of the looked nice as they when out to other tables
5
We are big fans of checking out local micro-breweries wherever we visit and The 1925 is certainly one to check out in Singapore. Nestled in a fascinating area of town, the 1925 is dishing up some of the best food and beer accompaniments we have found in quite some time. Try the crispy chicken skins - they will rock your world. We loved the atmosphere, and the friendliness of the staff. Plus the design of the restaurant was modern and funky, while still keeping the essence of it's history and location. Great place - can't wait to go back agai
4
Not too many places brew their own beer in Singapore, so I was quite curious to try this place. There's a selection of 6 beers available on tap of which we ended up trying 4. I particularly liked the dark beer. Prices are good during happy hour
5
Been to this place a couple of times before and it has never disappointed me with the food and service. Their selection of craft beer changes from time to time but with the brew master keep a close eye on it, they never seem to same beer on tap everyone I come. Their harimau prawns,crispy egg aglio olio and ribeye with foie gras is a must.Service is at its best with all the staff knowing what to recommend if you like beer or a cocktail.If you are around the corner do visit them and have a pint
4
Having wanted to check one of the microbreweries of Singapore, we went 1925, which is a small microbrewery and having exotic beer varieties. We tried their Indian ale. Very good and the potato skins we had along with the beer was also tastefully decorated. Nice and old 1925 style ambience with good service. Nice play to try when you are in Singapore
4
This cafe serve nice brew beer, the food more on western. The price was a it too high at that area. Staffs was friendly with good service.
4
Not central but you can arrive easily.
Great beer, nice pub food andfriendly and efficient service.
Remember that in Singapore the kitchen (and the pub too) close at 10 maximum 11!
4
I've been here three times in the past month with different groups of friends. On two of those occasions, the groups were large (14 and 20 people). On both occasions, we were given a large table made of 4 separate canteen tables on the 2nd floor. This was excellent for large groups as it was spacious and at one side near the window so we practically had a third of the second floor to ourselves. The food was average except for two items which were above average: chicken skins and beef paddle. The brewed beer changes from time to time and the better ones usually run out fast, so it would be a good idea to check what is available before heading down
5
It's a bit out of the way, but once you find The 1925 it's well worth it. We used to live around the corner and still make the pilgrimage back to savour the food (can be a bit hit and miss, but generally 4*) but more importantly the rolling selection of beers they have, from their own beers brewed behind the bar, to a rolling selection as far afield from Bend, Oregon, UK (Adnams!) and Australia. Half pints cheaper than full pints which we've argued with the staff at length about but to no avail...Great decor and nice place to hang out but a tad small, so book in advance
4
We had our team dinner on the second level of the place. The design of the restaurant is kept very industrial-vintage, retaining the look of the original walls of the shop house. The place specializes in home-brewed beer with extract specially flown in from the Czech Republic & Australia. We had fun trying out the different flavours of beer. There is also an extensive list of food to go along with the drinks. Our favourites are the Harimau prawns (entrée), pork belly (entrée), beef paddle (main), truffle mushroom soup, pulled pork burger (main) and tiramisu (dessert). The ambience was great, we couldn't get enough of the grubs and beers. The only grouse is that the lighting on the second level is not friendly for photo-taking.
4
I've visited a few times to 1925 as it is located near my office. It is definitely a good place to chill out after work and have a drink or two to relax.The food selection is good, and the food that I've tried taste good too. I always enjoy the guest tap as the owner brings in different country's beer. For the resident beer, I like the yellow van.Ambiance wise is good if it is for drinks. If it's for food, level 1 lightings are better as level 2 is a little too dark to see the food clearly
4
We had a business lunch upstairs. Great space. Good food ..attentive service..Only annoyance was the chinese contractor who kept drilling in light fittings without any interest in us - Not handled well by manager. I dont appreciate being disrespected. I stayed on for coffee afterwards downstairs which was enjoyable. With the exception of the lowbrow contractor it was a good place
4
Found this great bistro not far from our place. We ordered chicken and beef burger for dinner, tried thier home brew Yellow Van and Boho Lager. Burgers came with fries, my boyfriend and I both like the chicken more than beef, the beef is a bit plain and dry but still considered good. The flavor of Boho Lager beer is really good, refreshing and fruity, if you are also fan for Hoegaarden kind of white beer, you will enjoy it!The location is a little distance from Farrer Park station, around 10 mins walking, but we would definitely come back again
5
There are loads of good places to hang out on and around Jalan Besar but this is the best I have been to so far. They brew their own beer and also feature a selection of great guest beers on tap e.g. Brewdog. And the best thing about 1925 is they have a happy hour on Sundays (and weekdays) from 2pm to 6pm. During this time a half litre of beer costs $10++ which is (unfortunately) very reasonable by Singapore standards.The staff were friendly and even gave us a free serving of ice cream, we weren't sure if this was because of the amount we spent or because they thought we were drunk and needed sobering up!The interior is dark with polished concrete, the decor is to a very high standard. They play jazz / swing music which creates a nice atmosphere.I didn't try the food but will do next time
2
I stumbled across this bar while looking for some reasonably priced eats in Japan Besar. There was a great ambiance to the bar, with warm lighting and good music. The menu looked good and casual; and with the chance to sample new beers from a microbrewery I was in! The 1925 pale ales were quite good. The Indian pale ale in particular was aromatic and hoppy. The service was very pleasant and attentive (especially for a bar). I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger which at 18 SGD is no bargain. When it arrived with a generous side of fries I tucked in with gusto. It become apparent after about 3 bites that the big ,seared breast fillet was not cooked through. I left the fillet and explained to the waitress that I thought it was not cooked. She returned with it cut in half and attempted to explain that the cook thought it was cooked. I disagreed (it was pink, had no firmness at all. It was raw) and asked politely for the bill. I was not offered a discount or anything by way of amends. I probably wouldn't return... the beer was good though
5
We did a search for Microbrewery, and the 1925 came up. Enjoyed the Ginger beer, and some appetizers. I would definitely head back should I find myself in Singapore.
4
My bike breakdown near this area and I end up in this place in scorching heat to quench my thirst and this place certainly did not disappoint. Following is my review based on few areas that I had experience: Service - The best point about this establishment. Quite number of local staff which is rare in Spore F&B restaurant. They are well dressed, mannered and very knowledgeable. I feel they have extensive training from the management that running this brewery. I really love wine and dine in such F&B place. Bravo guys!Food - I did not try much since I was alone but the Burger Sliders that I had ordered that came with 3 various meat for mini burgers was awesome. On par with authentic burger restaurants. Kudos to their kitchen teamAmbience - Very simple but tasteful I would. Will be appreciate by bunch who loves old and rustic. Nice....Price point - During happy hours...freaking cheap I would say. So office folks. Please head your way there. But food price can be more competitive. Location: Slightly away from MRT but quite central if you don't mind walking 1000 metres from nearest MRT stations. Overall is fantastic and keep up the good job guys
4
Had a couple of drinks on a weekday afternoon, and the place was quiet and chill. There are 2 floors, and we chose the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor was brighter and there's a cool mural on one of the wall. It's a cool hipster place. Will try the food another time
4
Not many microbreweries in Singapore, and this one is located in a fun neighborhood not too far from the city center. Food options are bar foods plus some nice mains (I had a past with homemade pesto and prawns, which was very tasty). I didn't love the house beers, but not bad at all and nice to have something locally brewed. My husband's burger was good . We'd definitely consider checking out again
5
Once the food being served, I was shocked by their food decoration. After I start to taste the food, and definitely I will memorize it. It was just too great! You can't find another restaurant that serve this kind of food quality with such a reasonable price! Highly recommended!#I ordered BBQ chicken thigh
4
I found this place thanks to an online search for a local microbrewery. I was both disappointed and glad I stopped in here. The disappointment was that they only had 1 beer they brew on tap. The rest were imports from England which is great but I was in Singapore. I recognised some of them from my London trip last year. If you are a local and have a craving for some English beers, this place is definitely worth a stop. As a visitor, I wanted something more local. Other than that, the staff is very friendly. They explained the different beers they had on tap and the menu. They had some happy hour items but decided on some skewers. The chicken skewers were excellent. They were not dry or overcooked. A little off the beaten path (at least I thought it was) but an easy place to find. A definite place to stop in and try
2
Went for lunch with my friend. They had 3 beers on tap with 2 others from other local breweries. Beer was ok , but it was 15 sgd for 1 pint. The burger was 24 sgd and was served only with the bun, meat and cheese, with a side of fries. Had some kind of bbq sauce as well which was alittle off. I would expect atleast some lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, etc... I liked the fries, but with the bill coming to around 140 sgd for 2 people I was not impressed and disappointed. Step your burger game up 1925
3
I was staying in a hotel near and decided to go for some craft beer. I was suggested two brands by the boy behind the table to try out which I eventually did. The beer were either a bit over fermented or too sour for my taste. That's why I would suggest give yourself a try and decide as I did not like it that much but you never know. The atmosphere is of 1930s Singapore..woody and rustic...and relaxing. Try out the lil finger foods on the menu as well. Let me know if you shared the same experience as mine.thanksAbhijee

Went to 1925 Microbrewery for dinner on a weekend. The decor and ambiance were both nice, I liked the location, the music, the design and lighting.On food, I was disappointed to find out that their beef burger was not available. The disappointment was compounded by the special ginger beer also being unavailable. We ended up ordering the Pesto Fish and the Chicken Burger.Pesto Fish - Small portion and taste was not appealingChicken Burger - Burger was average, fries were nice and crispyTotal bill (post tax and service charge) came to ~$42 for the two mains, excluding drinks. Considering the area and the quality of the food, we left disappointed
3
My friend and I chanced upon this joint and decided to try it out.We ordered the yellow van and Blk6.22. Personally, I enjoyed the yellow van more as it has a lighter taste on the palette. The staff were very helpful and entertained our numerous questions on the beer. Best part was that they brew their beer by themselves, literally bringing the term "home-brewed" to a whole new level!My friend and I sat downstairs and enjoyed the relaxed, chill-out vibe. As we were here for drinks, we only ordered the truffle fries for something to munch on. The truffle fries were not bad, but I have tasted better. As we sat near the kitchen, we also noticed that our fries were hanging around the ready counter for a 15 mins before it was actually served to us. Hence, it wasn't as fresh or crisp as could be. Pity though.Nonetheless, had a great time here and would recommend for a chill-out spot
