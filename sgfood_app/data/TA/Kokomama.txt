I did not try the food but the coffee was really good. We tried the flat white and the espresso.
They offer pastries for breakfast too but we did not try them.

A group of us tried a variety of Snow Storm and we all liked it.
We tried Mango Madness, Milky Oreo, Cheesy Cheesecake and my personal favorite, Milo Dinosaur.
Kokomama is filled with energy; both from the guests and it's staff team!

The setting was pretty nice when I walked in. I had bought a student meal for my dinner at a good price ($7.90). There is also no GST or service charges, so you won't need to worry about the spike in the bill. The food there was great, especially the bakery they had at the counter. Of course, we had a slight inconvenience there, such as the staff member saying that the student meal was not ours when we were the only students there

Visited this cafe after having a meal at I'm Kim's Korean BBQ restaurant, which is located just next to it.. Tried four different flavours of Bingsu but however was not impressed by the taste as all of them tasted too sweet. Not really to our liking, but quite a nice place to chill with friends

Crispy exterior and thick creamy tasty salted egg that oozed out upon breaking apart their signature salted egg croissant at SGD 6.50!The green tea bingsu at SGD 12.90 was delicious as well with texture snowflake-liked coupled with the yuzu mochi a twist to the normal mochi one normally gets.Service was rather friendly, though it's self service, my food was served to my table

Located on the busy stretch of passerbys walking from dhoby ghaut to bras basah mrt is Kokomama. It is also situated on the ground floor of School of the Arts (SOTA), as such, they have an affordable menu. They have an excellent location between SMU, SIM, NAFA along with the SOTA students as well as being in a central location. Kokomama is marketed as â€‹a hip fusion cafe that sells different varieties of food and beverages - french bakery, chilli crab/curry/clam chowder bread bowls, rice bowls, coffee (latte etc), traditional kopi/ teh and dessert such as waffles and korean bingsu. And also affordable bread for people to take away!As the previous tenants of this shop used to be the now defunct 3 Petit Croissants, the massive industrial ovens are still embedded into 30% of the kitchen that you can see through the glass window. Which is why Kokomama offers pastries, cakes and even bread. It has a large variety of croissants to pick from.Once you take a glance at the menu, you realize you are looking at foods from different regions, like chilli crab sauce, QQ beef, unagi, baked rice and korean bingsu. It's quite hard to decide what exactly does this cafe cater to. But you can also tell based on the dining room arrangement, the owners probably wanted a no-frills cafe environment for students to hang out, grab a quick bite and dine in a comfortable environment.You can't miss this shop walking from Dhoby Ghaut or Bras Basah MRT.1. QQ Beef Rice $9.90First up, we had a QQ beef rice, the beef reminded me of Yoshinoya's beef bowl, but with less fats. I liked the salad that came in the rice too, made it feel more nutritious. Sadly unlike the yoshinoya beef bowl, the rice here was just your typical rice, rather than Japanese rice.There are options for sauces for the rice like chilli crab, clam chowder and curry chicken. These are also their soups for their signature blackout bread bowl. They serve these sauces to you in a small cup and you have the option to pour it into your rice. I felt that without the sauce, the rice was too dry to be eaten. The beef itself was slightly dry too and the texture could've been better.There also sprinkle some seaweed garnishing on the top.BBQ Unagi with Chilli Crab sauce2. BBQ Unagi with Chilli Crab sauce $12.90Next up unagi! They pretty generous with the unagi but same thing again, the rice wasn't Japanese rice. I wonder why they tout this in their Japanese menu but it's only Japanese because of the unagi and the seaweed?I enjoyed the unagi was it was tasty and because of the sauce, the rice wasn't as dry as the QQ beef.After mixing the unagi together with the salad and rice, you will have a mashed-up ungai salad with rice! Not a bad blend! If you're feeling up to it, you can also spread some chilli crab sauce into it. But I felt the unagi didn't go well with the chilli crab sauce. Which, can be a tad spicy.BBQ Unagi with Chilli Crab sauceHowever the rice together with the chilli crab sauce made the rice more bearable.3. Ham and Cheese baked rice $7.90The cheapest on the menu was their student meals and at $7.90 with a drink, I felt it was still a bit high for this area. I can't imagine spending $8 a meal in my secondary school days. The cheese was well baked. I attribute this to their well-equipped baking infrastructure passed down from the previous tenant. The cheese was thick and delicious. The cheese went through about half the layer of the rice, so the bottom half of the rice stayed dry. I guess it's your part to mix the cheese around to ensure you have a properly balanced rice and cheese ratio.For the rice that had cheese on it, the rice was good and tasty, together with the numerous slices of ham. It was better than expected. I felt that this was a better option than a well-known chain that also offers student baked rice. 4. Seafood Cheese Baked Rice $15.90Next I tried the seafood cheese baked rice. For the price, it's alot! Yes there's prawns and squid and what not, but $15.90? That's being a bit bold, I must say. The cheese tasted the same and the same thing with half the rice being dry. I wish they could've added more cheese to the rice, to ensure you don't end up with half a tray of plain baked rice.For drinks each person get a syrupy drink for a top-up for $2 with any main course. You can choose from blackcurrant, blueberry, iced lemon tea, lime, honey lemon and green tea.Check out the fun colours of our drinks! These are definitely catered to the students for sure!Blackcurrant - tasted like ribenaThe blackcurrant drink tasted like ribena to be honest! So not a bad choice for ribena lovers.BlueberryThe blueberry looked cool but it was too articial for me but hey! They were a couple of real blueberries at the bottom of my drink! How cool was that? Didn't expect that at all!Overall : A hit and miss place, good location, quick and fuss-free food
