Visited this restaurant which is in the Intercontinental Hotel as it was on my doorstop. Thoroughly enjoyed all the options we chose especially the softshell crab roll and the plum roll.
Setting is peaceful, service was very good but prices are on the high side.

Though awarded the Michelin Plate, the dinner was fairly disappointing for the price. Famous for its eel, which was quite good, the rest of the dishes were quite forgettable. The only other saving grace was it's charcoal grilled wagyu beef and tofu skin.

Best appreciated by anyone who loves japanese cuisine and swears by freshness. Never seen anything as clean precise and fresh at this branch restaurant out of Japan.
Expensive but worth every bit.

The Japanese food here is ok. One of the places which I will come back if I need some Japanese food in between my Japan trips.
Nothing great ... But ok.

We decided to go here walked out the hotel around the corner and in the door not realizing that there was an entry in the hotel lobby!! the food was OK service good, probably wouldn't return as there are so many good restaurants in Singapore.

The place to go for fine Japanese cuisine in SingaporeMust see if you are into Japanese food.There is always a special Japanese dish, just ask chef Watanabe-san.Japanese soshu better than anywhere else. I had a Jukushi which is difficult to find even in Japan.Don't expect a small bill but this is part of the fun that you have

I had lunch here on Sat, 9 Dec 2017 with two of my family members.Reception & ambience.With a reservation in hand, we were greeted politely and shown to our table. Place was fairly serene with some tables placed a bit too closely.Food: We each ordered a set lunch. Mine was the Sashimi set which comprised a mixed Sashimi platter of about 2 to 3 slices each of 5 different seafood, including Ika, Hamachi, Akami & slightly arboried Nama Hotate, a bowl of rice, miso soup, chawan mushi and a small dessert (a sort of mochi creme caramel). The Sashimi was pretty decent with slightly undersized slices but fresh and succulent in texture. My two lunch companioms had an Unagi set (this restaurant specializes in Unagi) and a wagyu beef main set respectively. The Unagi was rated as "excellent", with firm flesh, no jarring bones and well marinated with sauce that was tasty and not oversweet. The wagyu beef was grilled to medium (although I think medium rare would have been ideal) and pronounced as "very tasty" with a good meaty but tender texture. The Ocha is served by the cup and the wait staff (courteous enough but slightly understaffed) brought us a fresh cup rather than top up your cup from a teapot. The Ocha is a better than your average Japanese green tea with a "serious" ocha flavour, a result of a good brew using quality tea leaves.We also ordered a Spider roll (way overpriced @$29), a Tekka Maki and a California Roll (both very good and fresh) from the a-la- carte menu. The 3 rolls cost about an extra $80 so I recommend sticking to the set lunch menu. The Sashimi set was @$66. The Unagi lunch @$78 & the Wagyu Beef set @$80. Overall assessment:Ambience: Quiet but some tables a bit close to each other resulting in lack of privacy.Service: Polite enough but understaffed and insufficiently attentive.Food: Sashimi: Above average for a retaurant of this calibre. Unagi: Excellent. Beef: Very good.Value for $: On the pricey side, particularly the 3 additional makis & rolls. Total bill came up to @$290 for 3 persons.

I am from Japan and I grew up in Japan and I eat ell twice a month for more than 20 yeard ever since I starte making my own money.I ate eel with my paretns as I grow up so it is fair to say I eat ell for more than 300 times inclduing one in shizuoka and including chikuyotei in japan.Ever since I relocated in Singapore, I have eaten eel here more than 5 times. Taste is OK. it is a bit sweeter than chikuyotei in Japan. Tha is not the issue. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH BONE?????????Eel got too much bone.Eel does have bone.It is normal.Small bone should be everyehwhere, which is OK and which is how it should be.BUT, their e BONE is just TOO MUCH. TOO THICK IT STUKC ON MY THROAT FOR DAYS!Hwat is wrong with therei SHOKUNIN, the speicalize in eel.うなぎに骨がありすぎて喉の毎回刺さって痛くてせっかく美味しいんですけれどすごく不快です。シンガポールの人は骨が好きなのでしょうか？そうじゃないですよね。職人として、うなぎの骨の処理ができないのは、竹葉亭の名に恥じることです

This restaurant is in Enter-Continental hotel where I stayed during my business trip to Singapore. Hotel concierge recommended to try it. My knowledge about Japanese cuisine is mostly on the level of sushi or tempura. Here was something else. It was high level. Actually I choose only Hot sake and trusted restaurant staff. So they put me across the chef and I've got TAKE Omakase Course. It is mean that during almost two hours every 10 minutes I received small dishes mostly fishy Including crabs and salmon eggs. Also in some of them were meat, mushroom and tofu. It was strange taste but delicious. This dinner was finalized by small fruity desert. Dishes were small, but by the end I was full. Staff was very professional and friendly. This dinner cost around 300$. Very expensive, however I think that this experience worth it

This is the Japanese restaurant that I frequent whenever I am in the mood for good Japanese food. I opted for the Omakase meal. It is good to leave the meal to the chef, who will put forth dishes that are seasonal and prepared from the imported day’s catch. Just have to tell the chef your dietary restrictions and he will take care of the meal.The meal kicked-off with a platter of dainty appetisers: Hokkaido sweet corn (Sweet and crunchy), Fresh Salmon roe with bonito flakes and shoyu (taste good and the bonito added a nice flavor), Mulukhiya - Jute (a high-fiber crunchy Japanese vegetable with grated yam) and slow cooked Ayu fish in sweet sauce. Dainty start to the meal. Next up was the sashimi platter, which consisted of Ark shell, Octopus, Chutoro, Yellowtail and Tuna. All were fresh. Especially loved the Octopus and ark shell. The freshly-grated wasabi was good, whose taste was so unlike the commercial ones.Soup was served next. Today, it was a mini claypot. I opened it to reveal Kurobuta pork slices cooked in clear soup with sliced burdock and matsutake mushrooms and Japanese greens. Learnt that the pork slices is packed with collagen. After finishing this dish, I could feel my skin have the QQ feeling already. I wouldn’t mind another bowl please! Strange but true. I was served another platter of sashimi. My second for the meal! There were Kanpachi belly (Loved the firm meat and bite when eating this), Otoro (Melts in your mouth!), Surf clam (Interestingly, this was served poached, instead of raw. This tasted much better than the raw version, I must say). Not forgetting the Sanma fish (firm and crunchy).Matsutake mushroom: grilled first and the stem is sliced into thin pieces, while the top was simply cut into two pieces. Paired with 3 char-grilled spears of Japanese white asparagus, peeled then grilled. It was crunchy. Served with a slice of lime which you squeeze over the mushrooms and asparagus. For added flavor, you can add the Japanese salt on the side, which was sourced directly from a family-owned salt harvester. Unagi with rice: served bento style. Live unagi fishes are imported from Japan and prepared at the restaurant daily. Soy sauce was light and doesn't overpower the fish. Also came with a bowl of clear soup with thin fish cake slices and Unagi liver, which was light and tasty.To end, I was served the Shingen Mochi for dessert. Named after a famous samurai. Cast in a mould to resemble a mountain (Mount Fuji), with snow on the side. Beautiful! More like a jelly with a texture that reminded me of konyaku, instead of sticky rice cake. Came with fine sesame powder and black sugar syrup. Yum! Good quality ingredients used, which you can really taste in the food.The meal filled me up nicely, and I left happy. Will not be long before I am back again

It was one of my best visiting of a Japanese restaurant. The food was very delicious and fresh and the service was as well very recommended. It should be on the list of everyone who visit Singapore and like to go for Japanese food.
5
Tired and want to sample Asian delicacies, you don't have to travel far to taste it, just a trip downstairs
5
The food is divine, I recommend the Shabu-shabu. The sashimi is top grade and beautifully fresh. Service is gracious. Again, it's expensive but worthwhile.
4
Been to this fine restaurant twice and food and service is very good. Cuisine is fine traditional Japanese with no surprises. Lunch is always better value than dinner but both are expensive....

Hadn't been to this restaurant for a very long time but happy to report that the quality of food and service has not diminished.

Chikuyotei Dining is next to the lobby entrance of the intercontinental Singapore. We passed by several times each day on the way to the room elevators. The restaurant's main entrance visually seemed exclusive with a long walkway giving the illusion of size and luxury. Whenever we see a restaurant that can catch our attention we’re always tempted to giving it a try. Because Chikuyotei was located inside the Intercontinental Hotel, it was quite normal for hotel guests and other walk in customers to innocently assume it was part of the spectacular Intercontinental group of restaurants. It was deceivingly not so and not a part of the Intercontinental Group.We had such great afternoon hanging around Orchard Road. Cheerfully, people watching with a few drinks at Marriot Hotel Cross Roads Cafe while deciding where to dine on a Friday night. After some considerations, we decided on Chikuyotei and thought to accumulate some IHG points while dining and we've been tempted to try every time we passed by. When we first walked into the restaurant, the room was so bright like if entering a science lab. The interior was informal with a simple layout and very bland looking furniture. It felt more like a chain fast food eatery than a high end venue for fine dining Japanese cuisine. Clearly we were misled. With any common sense, anyone being presented with a menu having $$$$ printed on the right side of each page, one would expect great service and marvellous food? Well, that was definitely not the case here at Chikuyotei. Service was amazingly casual, food was just as average where in my humble opinion is less superior than many other fast food Japanese franchises in Singapore but with triple the price. We should have sense something was not right with this place when only two tables on a Friday evening were occupied in the entire restaurant. But, then again we hadn’t known it was independent of the hotel and gave it a try out of our high expectations on IHG’s standards. The servers must’ve been ex-military as they were constantly stomping their feet when walking by as if they were marching in a parade? They inconsiderately spoke to each other around us as if we were non existent. We usually ask the server to recommend their most popular dish on the menu whenever we dine at fine establishments. The most popular "signature” dish (it was even advertised on the menu as that) was the Unagi rice and to bluntly put it, it was average at best. We started to question our own taste buds or maybe Singaporeans and expats have a different palate then we had? If the underwhelming, soggy, overcooked, over sweetened Unagi dish was their “ signature” dish then what were we to expect on the other items we had ordered and to follow? We recently had one of the best Sea Urchin sushi at Nobu Intercontinental Hong Kong. So we wanted to try the Sea Urchin sushi at Chikuyotei to compare. The only male server in the restaurant took our order and the first thing he said abruptly was that the Sea Urchin cost $48 Singapore dollars per piece. Wow, that was subtle! It was so unbelievably rude to assume we were unable to afford this high end item from their menu! Were we wearing shorts or sandals? No, we always dress appropriately for dinner, some say I over dress. Being told the price on the menu items can be regarded as an insult. I thought we had already surpassed that racist era? Just like their lousy customer treatment, the $96 dollars for 2 pieces of sushi were falling apart right in front of our eyes milliseconds after arriving at our table. Part of the Sea Urchin fell off and landed on the table. Haha.. (Errrr.....) At least they had the common sense to quickly remove and replaced it with another similarly unappealing piece of sushi for us. Maybe that's just the way the substitute Sushi chef prepares his version of a $48 sushi? Yes, we later found out the head sushi chef had the (Friday) night off! The only semi decent dish we ordered would be the pork shabu shabu. It tasted very authentic and the broth was light, not over powering. My girlfriend who is from Singapore told me this place is popular amongst the office crowd for their set lunches. She was shocked with hearing about my unpleasant experience. Maybe that’s why the restaurant was so empty because of the high cost of the ala carte menu and no dinner set menu being offered? the Chefs must be used to cooking for large crowds from the style of plating? Or maybe we were just not their "cup of tea" as I did observed the older lady staff was being extremely attentive to one particular guest who dined alone at the next table. She also told us that they're running out of staff as no local young generation wants to work in the hospitality industry now a days. It reminds me of when traveling on a premium brand airline and you get a horrible flight attendant with attitude and the supervisor comes out trying to justify by telling you about the airline's problems and challenges. A poor excuse! I can only say that starting a business is easy when you have the right source, the right location, the right team. But, it’s not that easy to keep up the same high standard of quality in the product and service. To Maintain consistency, good managerial skill and strong motivation amongst the staffs is essential. Chikuyotei was definitely lacking on all fronts. Trust me on this one, save your “$96 dollars" and go for a delicious local venue. Afterall, Singapore is well known as a multicultural paradise hub of great cuisines!

Choose this place for our wedding anniversary. Great selection of set lunches, and unique Japanese dishes you can't find in Singapore. We loved the unagi and also the waygu beef. The restaurant was almost full, but service was prompt and food was very fresh. Will be back.

Yes, food is great, close to excellent, but...I can't say it differently, but this place it ridiculously high priced. We paid for a two people dinner $180. Mind you, I was still hungry after eating!The place itself, wants to be a fine dining restaurant but seriously lacks the interior and the service in order to do so. The tables are nothing special. Seating was uncomfortable and the table itself was sticky. On top of that, the service was not attentive at all. We've had to ask more than once to see the menu or get some additional water.As more and more people came the louder it got. They also seem to be have "back rooms" which was only for Asians (at least so it seemed).Seriously, do yourself, and your wallet a favor and eat somewhere else. This was very disappointing

Locals dressed as Japanese and speaking basic greetings welcome the diner,Spartan decor some tables and booths and a reasonably large counter area where up to two chefs work their so called magic.From the main entry corridor you have to pass by a huge glass fronted refrigerator filled with varied sake bottle prices are not for the faint of heart.I was offered four lunch menus with pictures and chose from their set lunch menu as the a la carte appeared ridiculously overpriced for such simple food.The presentation started with minimal mixed salad almost an infant portion,an egg dish with a small piece of chicken and then a bowl of rice with thin thinnest possible slices of varied daily catch topped with uni and salmon roe more as an after thought decoration,if you are on a diet this is the place to eat.I found solace in a French bottle of wine and not the ridiculously priced sake as offered.On a weekend day at lunch time there were approximately ten diners and myself with another three at the counter.The chef in front of me took over thirty minutes to make a simple salad for a guest and when I was about to finish my meal the time was 2.20pm I was asked would I like anything else as they were closing.......A couple arrived a moment later and they were told in front of me sorry we are closing,I cannot in all fairness give them marks as there is simply no atmosphere and cannot be placed as a true dining experience only a unique one,I will not go again.............

I had a really really strong unagi craving, and having heard of their reputation in Japan, I went with my father. While the unagi was alright, their sashimi was ordinary at best. I can't say nothing much. The service was good though, food came very quickly
5
Place is nice and so crowded and the food is really delectable. ingredients are all fresh and the food in totality is worth my two thumbs up:)
4
Portions were just right for lunch. Atmosphere very comfortable, and food pretty yummy! It was crowded enough not to feel isolated, yet quiet enough to have your own personal chats

Inside of InterContinental Hotel in Bugis. Nice location.
Taste is real Japanese but price is bit expensive. We visited there by 4 people with several beers
and food by business but price is bit expensive. I won`t go by private.

Chikuyotei, an authentic kaiseki-ryori restaurant, located on the lobby level of the InterContinental Hotel on Middle Road. Kaiseki-ryori is a traditional Japanese multi-course meal. They can be either themed grilled eel, Kagoshima Kuroushi wagyu, Kurobuta pork, etc. or non-themed, but either way each dish is masterfully crafted juxtaposing and balancing taste, texture, appearance, and the colour of ingredients, then served on beautiful ceramic ware and lacquer ware. In short, kaiseki is truly, edible art. If you like eel, this is the place to be. Food is super and service is great and friendly. All is prepared to perfection!Chikuyotei is definitely the place to go for a unique and genuine Japanese experience
5
It was my first time to dine at Chikuyotei here at the InterContinental Hotel in Singapore. Amazing experience. Very good and friendly service. Food quality was very good and delicious. The freshness of their sashimi and sushi was really making my night there a lot better

My wife and I dined here last night, and had a wonderful meal.There is a wide range of Japanese food styles offered, and the place was packed.We chose to sit at the sushi bar, though ordered a range of other dishes too.The theatre of the sushi chefs was great, matched by excellent food.Service was attentive, and efficient.Drinks were wide ranging with good choices of sake.Quite expensive, bur worth it.Highly recommended
2
The food was just ok deserves a "average" rating (maybe I should have tried sushi, but I had grilled eggplant -dull-, grilled mushroom -the whole recipe is in the name... Duller- and wagyu - didn't taste like wagyu was just ok and little quantity-. Essentially a teenager could have cooked all this the same way.So if he prices were not sky scraping it would be average, but at this level of price it is not even worth this. Avoid this place
5
I can only judge a Japanese restaurant by the freshness of its ingredients. In this case, the restaurant delivered what I expected. All seafood and vegetables served in the restaurant is imported from Japan and are flown in three times a week ( to get the freshest, please check their shipment dates). Even the Unagi is freshly imported from Japan, and the fish is still swimming in the kitchen before they grill it for the customers. (In Singapore, most restaurants serve frozen Unagi). The freshness of the fish can be enjoyed and is not overpowered by the Unagi sauce. Price is above average. If you're prepared to pay for fresh seafood from Japan, this is a good place to be

After a great dining experience at this restaurant recently, I came back here for lunch and went for the omakase lunch.We were seated at the sushi counter, which uses Japanese wood and we were able to watch the chef in action and also talk to the chef about the origins of the ingredients of the dishes he prepared. The chef is knowledgeable and well versed in sushi preparation and cooked food. Here are the courses that we had:- Stewed Bonito: The first course of the meal. Served cold and very refreshing, with tasty gravy.- Fresh beancurd skin topped with seaweed, roe and freshly grated wasabi: The chef gets this special supply of fresh beancurd skin that’s ben layered to create tofu. Topped with the other ingredients, it was a delightful dish.- Teapot soup: Drinking the soup with and without squeezing the lime made the soup taste different. After drinking the soup, you can eat the prawns, mushrooms and vegetables that has been cooked inside.- Sashimi -- Hokkaido sea urchin: The chef only imports the best brand from Hokkaido and if its not available, it means the quality is not up to their standard. It has heavenly.- Setouchi Sea bream: Biting into this white fish gave a good bite. Definitely fresh!- Nagasaki Spanish mackerel: The chef flame-broiled the outside of the fish – skin side in front of us. It gave the fish a slightly smoky flavour. I usually do not like mackerel and this changed my perception. Loved it. - Wakayama strip jack: Also fresh and delicious.- Hokkaido scallop: It was very sweet and delicious. Must-order.- Assorted fish with Goma dressing: Assorted fish that was marinated in home-made sesame dressing. The dressing was unlike any that I have tasted and definitely not off the shelf. It was good.- Fried Japanese fish with Japanese sweet potato cut in the shape of the Ginko leaf: Decent piece of fish that was skewered on a stick, coated with small bread crumbs and fried. Fish was very good. It came with two pieces of Japanese sweet potato that has been cut into the shape of a ginko leaf. Good presentation. It also had two soba noodles that has been tied at one end with seaweed and deepfried. I had thought it was toothpicks and inedible till the chef said I could eat it.- Mini hotpot with Oysters, crab meat, seasonal mini Japanese potato and cream and cheese sauce: Another highlight of the meal. I wasn’t expecting the whole oysters in there and together with the cream sauce, it was yummy!- Rice topped with Unagi, Japanese pickles and Nagoya Miso Soup: Last course of the meal. It was a mini bowl of Japanese rice topped with two pieces of freshly grilled unagi. The unagi was soft, but do be careful of bones. We were filled to the brim after our meal, and most importantly, the food were fresh and good!I look forward to visiting the restaurant again in the near future

For years, we passed Chikuyotei in the Intercontinental Hotel, intending to have dinner there. Finally we walked in at 8 pm, and they set a table for us. It was quite crowded. Our favorite dishes by which we evaluate Japanese restaurants are agedashi tofu and miso cod. Chikuyotei offered only teriyaki cod, which was good but comparatively small. The agedashi tofu was authentic with bonito flakes, but there were two instead of three cubes, and the outside was so sticky that all of it separated from the tofu when we tried to break it in half. In addition, we had fried eggplant which came as four small pieces. There was no complimentary fruit at the end of the meal, but the prices were higher than at comparable Japanese restaurants that do provide a little extra at the end of the meal. Service was very good. We felt our enjoyment of the food, service, and surroundings divided by the price was between average and very good. We were able to charge our bill to the hotel. We think the lesson for us is that when we go to a restaurant that receives frequent enthusiastic reviews for specific dishes (in this case, unagi and Kagoshima beef), we should stick to those specific dishes. But we expect to eat at other Japanese restaurants in Singapore where the food was more to our taste before we return to try the unagi
