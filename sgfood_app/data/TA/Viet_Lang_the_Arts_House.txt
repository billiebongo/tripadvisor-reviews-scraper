Had a business lunch at Viet Lang and it was great as always.
Food was delicious and service was very good. As it is on the pricey side, I usually visit this restaurant on business or special occasion.
Highly recommend the Pho and wraps! :)

It's an absolutely beautiful building in the old Parliament House. Nice Vietnamese food well-presented ( but not cheap). We chose to eat there because it's just around the corner from the Arts House where we were seeing a show.

Black Cod is the only reason you need to visit this place. Excellent food. Great service. White linen kind of place.

We haf the daily menu and everything was very tasty, but the best part was the staff. The most friendly staff we've ever encountered, they were nice, polite, and talkative if you wish. They discreetly check your needs and offer you service drinks or more salad or soup. 10/10 for them

We Had booked in advance for a Saturday evening. On reaching there, found the place to be empty except for one group. We initially thought that perhaps the place and cuisine is very special and hence more exclusive. The setting is nice but the cutlery or the presentation does not befit it being termed as a classy restaurant. We ordered crepes, snapper pancake and Pho ga (Vietnamese chicken noodle soup) and Singapore sling. Portions were large but none of the items were extra ordinary. The Singapore sling tasted fine. The crepe was chewy and did not appear to be freshly prepared. The experience was in contrast to the reviews that we had read about the place. Will not go there again. Not much value for money except for the fact that they are located in a beautiful building

We couldn't find anything we want, if not for my tired son we would leave the restaurant after viewing the menu. Fried Spring rolls without pork, papaya salat without dried beef... all are strange to any Vietnamese people. There was only one other customer in a Saturday evening having a dish of fried rice. We ordered only cold nodle with beef and chicken wings in nước mắm. we had only one bite on the cold noodle (bún bò xào) and couldn't have more because it was too salty. And what's more, we couldn't stand the crazy banal Vietnamese music

We happened upon this restaurant when we saw their signboard for a set lunch and so we returned when they opened. Cuisine is Vietnamese and all three courses were tasty and attractively presented. And it was cool inside with a friendly wait staff. We were pleased we found them

We were walking in the neighborhood on the way to the Asian Cultures Museum and happened upon Viet Lang. Since tummies were grumbling and lunch tempted we stopped into Viet Lang for their noontime three-course set menu. It was delightful. Excellent food. Good service. A perfect break. Recharged, we reported for cultural duty after lunch. If we lived in Singapore we would add Viet Lang to our regulars list

My husband and I 'stumbled' on VietLang when we headed to the Arts House for an exhibition. Being super health conscious we hesitated with the Vietnamese crepe but thought to give a try and somehow managed to get the staff from the sister café to send in the Chicken curry. Heaven!! Staff was superbe, the wine selection and food was just perfect. Perfect date night with hubby and since then have brought in business associates for lunch and dinner from OS (as recently as last night) and everyone not only loves the food but really enjoyed the experience of eating Vietnamese food (lots of fresh starters requiring your fingers to get to work!!). Highly recommend for food, staff, service and atmosphere

It has been awhile since I visited Viet Lang and discovered it made shifted one building down. But the décor (back to the future), the service (imagine 1950s) and the food (modern take on north and central Vietnam) were as good as I remembered. The dinner was always going to be a tricky one. Where do you take rather food fussy Vietnamese who were originally from HCM but now living in the US but pining for Vietnamese food? As they were in eat mode we had, I think, everything on the menu except the individual noodle dishes. What stood out for me were the imperial rolls (rice paper prawn salad rolls though not with as many favours of mint as I remembered), the soft shell crab (crisp, moist and finger licking good), the duck curry (very creamy but they ran of baguettes) and coconut ice cream. But the other dishes were good (nothing was bad or left) and showed strong French influences. From the past I remember slow service but given it was a leisurely dinner the pace suited that ambiance of yesteryears. Food wise, specialist outlets in Vietnam (notably HCM, Hanoi, Hue and Hoi-An), Sydney, Paris and west coast USA have been better but as a package I would count Viet Lang to amongst the top 10 Vietnamese eateries I have visited

Went here with a large group and had a set menu. Delicious food and beautiful setting. On the pricey side but worth it for a nice meal. Staff was very accommodating.

Two years ago we visited this location when it was the 1827 restaurant, so sought it out again only to find it is now the Viet Lang. The restaurant has been redecorated and has a very fresh feel to it.For entree, we had the soft shell crab rice paper rolls - they were not quite the hit we were expecting, but still good, however, the other dish that we ordered (some kind of crepe) was to die for. We then shared the Hanoi steam boat for our main course and it was so fresh, healthy and tasty. Service was attentive. All in all, a beautiful meal and while we left feeling very full, it was such fresh, healthy food that we knew we hadn't blown our diets too much. Would definitely visit again

This place will get more and more busy once the nearby construction is completed (which I didn't hear today) and the National Art Gallery is completed. Until then, even better! This is located in a historic building, and highly recommend sitting outside - nice shade. Oh, the food! Rather high-end Vietnamese fare which is well done. if you've lived in Asia, you've had this before - but it is very good, just nothing spectacular. I wasn't that adventurous - beef salad and thai chicken, so perhaps that's a bit unfair. My colleagues had the set menu which had a nice variety. Service was a bit slow which can try one's patience during a business lunch, but otherwise, they're ok. A nice place, not so easy to find with the construction going on at the moment - but definitely worth the trip

We were given lots of recommendations by our friends for a good lunch spot when visiting the Asia Civilizations Museum. But Viet Lang caught my eye as I wanted to explore the Arts House and figured Vietnamese cuisine is always good on a hot and humid day (and what day isn't hot and humid in Singapore). The space is quite lovely, with an outdoor patio if you prefer open air. I had the cold rice noodles and a glass of wine while my friend had the pho and a Singapore Sling. We were both pleased. After lunch, we wandered over to the small museum store which had a few quite nice items and a very friendly clerk. There's also a nice looking cafe in the building, which we were tempted to try.All in all, a nice visit and within our budget

We have visited this restaurant a few times through the years, and it has been very consistent as to ambiance, service and food.We have been sticking to the set lunch, which offers a pleasant, well cooked meal which I believe is genuinely Vietnamese. The room is pleasantly cool and the service is quick and friendly, leaving you the time you need to enjoy your meal and your company. The house wine is good. We find the price reasonable considering the whole "package"

-This is one of the best meals in a Singapore restaurant and definitely the Vietnamese food in Singapore.-Each dish was excellent. - Appetizer (Imperial Rolls), Main course (Duck curry + prawns steamed in whole coconut) + Dessert (Caramelized bananas with coconut gelato + cassava cakes) + Vietnamese coffee.I would recommend each one of the dishes.-Service is really quick and efficient.- The prices are on the higher end- entrees are around $22-28. - It is located at the Arts House, which is actually Singapore's old Parliament House. It was built in 1872. So in addition to the oh-my-god food, you can have a peek into Singapore's history and the local arts and literary scene.-After dinner, you can take a lovely walk beside the Singapore river

This restaurant is located at the Old parliament house. It was just besides the Victoria theatre which is undergoing renovation now, so you can only see construction in progress if you sit outside to dine. We went there to have our lunch in a group. That was around 2pm plus and it was over lunch time. The place was quiet, with a few tables occupied. The food was okay but not fantastic. Especially the noodle soup, we all felt that it was not served hot, the soup had already cooled down when arriving at our table. But what I like is their soft shell crabs, it was yummy. The paper roll with prawns was okay as personally I do not like the taste of raw bean sprout. But it was okay. The service of the waitresses was good. Patient, and quite efficient. Price wise, it was not cheap. You can expect a bowl of noodle soup costs ard 20 over dollars. The food we ordered including deep fried soft shell crabs, mango salad, 6 bowls of noodle soup, paper rolls with prawns, paper roll with soft shell crabs and a few drinks cost us about 300 over dollars and each of us paid $46 for one share. One can order their set lunch which costs ard 30plus dollars.But as I said, if you can sit down at a quiet and nice environment to enjoy your food with good service, isn't it worth to pay a little bit more

We decided to sit at an outside table as there was a nice breeze for a change. There was some building work going on opposite but it wasn't loud enough to put us off our food. Everything was fresh and delicious, especially the prawn spring rolls, much better in fact than we had in Vietnam! However the standout was the Pho Bho. i have to say i baulked at the SGD 21 being charged until I saw the bowl it came in which was huge and more than enough for two or more people. It was absolutely delicious, perfectly seasoned with a beautifully warm beefy flavour. We will return

This is a very well appointed restaurant and a great location( just behind the Parliament House ) in a lovely colonial building. The food here seemed to take on a modern flavour rather than the tried and tested Vietnamese fare. This worked for the starter which was an open plate of rice paper, salad leaves and a beef roll which the guest is required to roll up and dip in the sauce as well as lovely green mango and pomelo salad topped with prawns which was closer to Thai food. The clear mushroom soup had hints of a Tom yum soup. What did not work so well was the main which was grilled fish and chicken
