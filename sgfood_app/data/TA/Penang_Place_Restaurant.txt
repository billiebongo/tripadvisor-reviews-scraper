Wide range of food & fruits are fresh.

Would be great to have Satay.
Comfortable settings & location is ok

My family of 5 together with a helper went to Penang Place for lunch last Saturday. And we enjoyed the food very much. The Fried Chicken was delicious. The Char Kway Teow was expertly done (with lots of Wok Hei) and they kept refilling it as it was done in small portions every time. So we could get almost piping hot Char Kway Teow. I also liked the Fried Assam Prawns as they were very flavourful. The Satay was very good too, though I found it a tad over on the sweet side. The Penang Hokkien Mee was good enough, though I have tried better ones in Penang. The Penang Laksa was a bit lacking in robust flavours.The desserts were also good. I especially like the Steamed Glutinous Rice with Kaya and had several servings of them. My wife said that the Pulot Hitam was good too.The service was good too. Though it was crowded, the wait staff were very prompt in clearing our plates

Penang Place in Suntec City is not difficult to find. We were glad we made reservations for 6.30pm as the dinner crowd was not in yet. The food was better than I expected. The buffet spread had a good variety of Penang cuisine. There was rojak, Assam fried prawns, crispy chicken wings, achar ( pickled vegetables ). I thoroughly enjoyed the Penang Hokkien mee- the thick soup was superb, the best Iâ€™ve tasted. I had 3 helpings- my guilty pleasure. Bryan, the young man who served us,was very friendly. We enjoyed the freshly fried char kweteow too. You will be spoiled for choice when it is time for dessert. There were several types of Peranakan kueh- my favourite was the kueh ko swee which was so soft. We loved the mango pudding, gui ling gao and cut fruit. We were too full to eat the ice cream, pulut hitam, ice kacang and chendol. Drinks are not included in the buffet. Our plates were promptly cleared after each round. The ambience and overall service were very good. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

Had dinner there yesterday quite crowded best to make reservations. Great food, char kway teow is a winner, other delights including century egg porridge, chilli mussels, nasi lemak, except the duck soup tasted like bak kut teh soup, Penang laksa is good and a variety of yummy nyonya desserts. Thumbs up for the chefs as we can taste food were cooked with pride. Perhaps they can include some drinks maybe coffee/tea to complete the meal. Will definitely visit again

We were in Suntec City mall and we were looking for a restaurant because we were very hungry, we made our order via an Ipad, 5 minutes later my plate arrived with fried chicken. The chicken was not very warm anymore but I was so hungry I still ate it. Then when I lift my chicken I saw HUMAN BLOOD on my plate. It was so disgusting we left. Never again

Took 4 friends out for a BUFFET dinner here on a Friday. What's nice?Char kway teow (fried rice noodles) - see photo.Penang Laksa - sweet sour spicy - see photo.Nasi lemak - rice with mildly spicy anchovies, cucumber, hard boiled egg.Satay - skewered grilled meat (only chicken satay served).Kueh - kuih.Location: Suntec City (above convention centre).Cost per pax: approx. $36 (after incl. 10% service charge plus 7% goods & services tax)

Have been visiting the restaurant in its old premise at one-north then. As it shifted to the current location, we came back to give it a try since it has not been operating for several months.We came by for the lunch buffet on a weekday. Well, would say the ambience was nice and cosy (better than at the old premise), very bright and nicely decorated (lots of flowers around) too. As for the food, generally it was about the same in terms of quantity (though we would expect it to be slightly more since the price has gone up) and quality. There were some "hits and misses" but overall, was a satisfactory meal. Would recommend the satay, rojak and goh hiong, bun with crab sauce, chicken curry and sambal prawns. The penanag laksa, a different version from our local one, was ok. Some items were a bit too oily or salty. The kuehs were nice, though a bit too sweet for me.And the service was fine as the used plates were cleared quite promptly. Only feedback was that the replenishment of some food items were much slower (especially the more popular items like the fried kuey teow etc) and they were quickly "depleted" due to a great demand.Overall a satisfied meal. Would give a 3.5 rating but since not able to award a 0.5 (and feeling that it has not yet reach the 4 rating), so decided to give a solid 3 rating.Hope they will look into and improve and will likely to revisit again

We went to Penang Place to have some authentic Peranakan food. Unfortunately the food lacked taste and was the worst example of Peranakan food I have ever eaten in my more than 50 trips to Singapore since 1979. I guess people come here because its a buffet so you can enjoy quantity if not quality.One example: the beef rending lacked any flavor. I have eaten considerably better for few dollars at various food courts.Stay away - Singapore has great food and there are much better options elsewhere
4
We were searching for a good place to have lunch on our first day in Singapore and we stumbled upon Penang Place.It was a marvellous decision healthy and hearty food, we ate it all with gusto and enjoyment.If you are nearby, drop in and taste the quality offered by Penang Place.To cap the experience off, the service was also very good
4
Great place for authentic Penang food buffet, love the assam laksa, satay, prawn, hokkien soup noodle, and many more. Good variety of desserts, Super delicious Pulut hitam.
2
This is my second visit because a friend wanted to try, disappointed with the menu, fried Kuay Teow is so so, Desserts and Rojak quite disappointing!Coffee and tea not included, for price of S$24.90 ++ not worth it, hawkers' foods.
4
Good and authentic Penang food like char Kway teow , lor bak etc except no coffee n tea . Service staff very efficient and always with a smile . Worth a re visit if you crave for Penang food
5
The place serves Penang food. The fried Kway Teow and Penang prawn noodle is nice. The buffet is good value. The spread has Assam prawns, fish curry ,beef rendang and curry chicken, Assam laksa , Penang Hokkien mee, chendol, rojak, Nasi lemak, lots of local cakes.

We were planning to have a family lunch recently, and after heared and reading a number of very good things about this restaurant that served Penang fare, the choice of a venue seemed to be an easy one. The restaurant's website lists a very broad range of items on their buffet menu. The reality is that not all the items were on offer; however, what was available was decent and didn't miss out on any dishes you would expect to find at stalls on Gurney Drive. Because folks have different tastes, there's bound to be something to please most palates. The most staked out dish was the char kway teow which disappeared within minutes of a new batch being released. I certainly enjoyed it (nice plump prawns it had) as well as the hokkien mee and jiu her eng chye (cuttlefish salad), assam prawns, chilli mussels, and herbal duck soup. Diners are invited to make their own rojak as well as the air kachang or chendol for dessert. I didn't manage much dessert because I was quite stuffed by then, but fans of Penang food should certainly be able to do justice. Prices were relatively reasonable, but take your time and enjoy the lovely food
4
The price that one pays for the spread of the buffet is good. Sufficient no of is service staff to clear off the used plates/ bowls so much so that we are always ready for change of food. Staff are also friendly n courteous Food is good too. Good for family get togethe
5
This was my first visit, but my mother has been going there for years since they were at Fusionopolis.The food is first class! Every dish has the authentic, old fashioned taste that my relatives remember from their childhood. So much to eat. So much to choose from. Excellent service by the staff.The owner, Kiat Hoe, has been an acquaintance from many years ago. He looks like part of the kitchen staff as he goes about clearing plates, refilling empty trays of food, checking on supplies, ... If you don't know him, you would not even have noticed his existence.Here's some of the menu:Fried kway teowAssam laksaPrawn noodle soupAssam prawnsNasi lemakRojakThey even have western salads.Make a reservation beforehand. The place is always packed. Go early and take your time to savour every dish. It's worth your time and money
5
Great variety and quality penang eats in singapore! Char Kway teow was fried upon request. Kueh pie tee, century egg porridge, herbal duck soup are delicious. Nani lemak was aromatic. DIY rojak station was sufficient. Nonya kuehs at the dessert station were fragrant. Restaurant is very clean. Service staff are all very polite
5
I went here with my family, this place is pretty hard to find because its located inside a mall in the basement floor..But this restaurant served various cuisine from many countries..you can taste all of them as much as you can! And its very very delicious ! 
4
If you are looking for a halal restaurant that serves a wide variety of penang food at a reasonable price, this is the place I would highly recommend. We truly enjoyed the spread of food from their main courses to the desserts. The overall experience is a great one
4
The service is excellent and the Penang food truly authentic. But being the only big-scale truly Penang "makans" in Singapore, regulars have to bear with the lack of Penang default hospitality of free flow of tea & coffee !
3
If you are looking for great value for money buffet, this is the place.
Price is very reasonable, plenty of food and choices, but don't expect great quality.
Service is average.
4
The food is authentic and the Char Kway Teow is nice. I personally love the Penang Assam Laksa, although it is a little more watery than those I experienced in Penang.My daughter really like the herbal duck soup as well as the chicken wings.Service was not fantastic but I will not sweat it due to the price. However, the water jugs that are used to refill cold water really needs to be re-looked at. Each time the cups were refilled, water simply poured or dripped all over the table, which in one instance, almost a quarter of the jug of water was on the table
4
I visited Singapore and met with old friends for lunch on a weekday.There's a buffet for workers in the area, and I must confess that I was feeling envious of this option for them! A varied, tasty range of Singaporean/Malaysian food that I had too much of! The service is helpful, available without being in the way and despite the large room with very little in soft furnishings, the noise level was very acceptable.You can always order from the a la crate menu for lunch, but why bother when the buffet is such great value and delicious?I'm glad I don't work her or I would get fat fast (or fall asleep at my desk!

My group of 14 people had buffet dinner on the 13th Aug 2016. The restaurant was packed full with about 150 people. The varieties of food cooked in the style of Penang amazed me. The TOP 3 dishes I like the most was Char Koay Teow, Cuttle fish with Eng Chai, and Hokkien Mee. The cost per head was S$35.20 net. I would say the value for money was average. No hot drinks like coffee or tea. Hot or cold water was provided free flow. Recommended for people who like to have a taste of Penang style foods
4
This place serves really authentic Penang food. My mum was from Penang before married to my dad. Every year we go back her hometown in Penang so I consider myself very familiar with Penang food. After disappointed by so many so-called "authentic Penang food" in Singapore, finally I found this place. The buffet has a wide spread of food. The highlight is char kway teow which no one can miss. I recommend the prawn noodles soup and lor bak
5
Came here with a large group of colleagues for lunch. It has a good spread of Peranakan food. The fried kway teow was especially popular. Good place for large groups since there are plenty of seating and we can all get food at our own pace. Everyone had a good time
4
Amazing range of dishes on offer and food was high quality. Service very attentive with plates being removed as soon as empty. Highlights were Penang assam laksa, Penang lobak, nasi lemak, Penang fried kway teow noodles with prawns, and various curries. Dishes were regularly replenished with freshly cooked food. Desserts included serve your self Penang rojak, glutinous rice cake desserts, cendol and ice kachang, pulut hitam, etc. All delicious. Make sure you are well starved on arrival as otherwise difficult to do justice to the huge range of dishes. Seems excellent value for those with big appetites at around S$25 for lunch buffet
4
Save your trip of going all the way to Penang for the best Penang fried "kway teow" noodles and fish laksa along with its famed Nyonya curries and glutinous cakes etc., for merely SGD23.90 lunch buffet in this clean, well-lit and spacious restaurant !The service is excellent though a little rustic and less refined compared to lunch buffets in the big hotels in town. Nevertheless, its ideal rustic "kampung" Penang ambience would be largely enhanced with the indispensable free-flows of local Penang coffee and jasmine tea 
1
I booked a table for 5 and was told we have to sit outside the restaurant area, but still within the building. When my family arrived we were lead to a long table setting with one table covered with a tablecloth and the other is bare. The height of both tables are different. There were a lot of tables also set this way so I ask to be put in a proper table setting with the same but was refused. So i left. Apparently, they are just setting tables up with no proper plannin
4
- good buffet, try the char kway teow
- conveniently located above an MRT station
- can get crowded, make reservations early.
4
Had a company event there last week. Food was good, prawn noodles, kueh tiao, porriage. You may not like everything but I am sure you will like something.
Big and spacious, the location is easy to find. Go give it a try.
4
The Penang kwey teow is a must try!! Provided u could get hold of it..the restraunt needs to replenish it more often..another must try is thier rendang dishes!
4
This Penang Buffet is really one of the best cheap eats I have come across! The food are authentic and the serving is all you can eat. You get char koay teow, satay, assam laksa, laksa, rojak, ngoh hiang, cerial prawns, soup, nasi lemak, nasi bryani, curries, etc etc. There is also some of the local malaysia salads with different sauces and chillies so hot you burn your tongue out!! (which is what suits me!!).The spread of dessert and kuih kuih is really value for money!! This restaurant is quite popular so better to book to ensure you get a place during weekends

This restaurant moved from the IMM building to it’s current location at Basement 1, Unit 20 to 24 of the Fusionopolis Building, is owned by Paul and Hannah Ooi. Born and brought up in a Nyonya family, Paul has employed Penang chefs to bring high quality authentic Penang food made with fresh ingredients to Singapore.The restaurant has a large sitting capacity, the setting non ostentatious with a few Nyonya articles like food baskets and carriers for table decorations. No WiFi, comfortable noise levels, subdued lighting with soft background piped Christian music. Most patrons come for the Penang Buffet where it’s help yourself to the food, but the service is still attentive and polite. Empty dishes in the buffet are quickly replenished, and there’s ample cutlery for the diner.We came for the Buffet dinner, and found an impressive array of Penang dishes laid out among which are evergreen favourites like Penang Char Kway Teow, Penang Laksa Asam, Jiu Hu Enchai, Penang Rojak, Penang Hokkien Mee, Lobak, Choon Piah, Chicken Satay, Chicken Curry, Beef Rendang, Dry Curry Sotong, Asam Prawns, Nasi Lemak, Indian Vegetarian Rice, to name some; and for deserts an assortment of Penang Kueh Kuehs, Ice Kachang, Penang Chendol, Bubur Cha Cha, Salted Egg Custard Bun, Siew Mai and Prawn Siew Mai wrapped in spinach leaves, Pulut Hitam, plus a few others. The food is cooked without lard for health reasons and to cater to the Muslims. Some bottled food items like Achar and sauces, are for sale at the reception counter.You are definitely spoilt for choice, but with some discretion, eat the dishes that you find appealing in small amounts ( with second helpings if desired ) as any wastage is charged at $5.00 for 100 grams of food not eaten on your plate. The food is delicious, tasty and certainly authentic. Cost for adults is $26.90 for the dinner buffet and $23.90 for lunch buffet. Children are charged $16.90 and $14.90 respectively before tax and service charge.The restaurant also has an ala carte menu which is served from Monday to Fridays for lunch, and Monday to Thursday for dinner. They offer catering as well.A convenient place for bringing family or friends for a meal, in a relaxed atmosphere and pleasant ambience without breaking the bank. Certainly value for your money especially for people who have huge appetites and stomachs. Parking at the basement of Fusionopolis One is available

My husband and I moved to Australia from Singapore 13 yrs ago so whenever we take a trip back, it's the hawker food that we miss and Penang Place fills our cravings because the buffet has a wide selection of food, not to mention the desserts that we miss too! Even though some of the food is cooked Penang style, there is plenty of Singapore-style food as well
4
This is the way to get your fill of Penang food -- Penang laksa, char kway teow, nasi lemak, kueh pie ti, rojak, all types of gooey steamed snacks, chendol and ice kachang. The price was quite reasonable for dinner - about SGD $35.Good place for good eats with friends
4
We simply enjoy Penang food and although its really very bad for the bulging tummies, the occasional trip to this place is well worth it. It is a buffet and the quality and consistency of the food is really good. We have been back here many times and although it is still a little bit pricey (especially if you only go for a few of the many choices), it is still value for money. Recommended
4
The wide spread of famous Penang food...from desserts to typical Penang Laksa, Penang Fried Kway Teow, Fruit Rojak, Nasir Lemak...I like the tender ladies fingers added to the coconut rice is a real treat. Cut fruits (prevent oxidation) and jelly are stored in a chiller ; great thought by management. Good location and spacious area makes it a good venue to catch up with good old friends....our SG50 alumni lunch
5
~celebrated our colleagues birthdays over lunch, fuss free trust full Penang Place... make sure you've a reservation, even during the weekdays~we took the buffet, so we're ushered to the tables with water jugs already placed, go take everything you ever thought you'd missed in Penang and every taste will come back to you~apparently 6 Penang chefs work ala minute cooking up a storm that's lapped up by the patrons as soon as they're served at the buffet spread, some like the Char Kway Teow with "See Hum" is in such high demand that they get walloped soonest ~I like the Nasi Lemak (coconut milk rice with condiments), Beef Rendang (curried beef cubes), Char Kway Teow (Fried rice noodles with bean sprouts, fish cake & cockles), Penang Laksa (curry soup with fish flakes & more) & Ice Kachang (crushed ice with choice of sweet fillings), and there was this fish soup with tofu that simply hits the spot :)~The large shelled prawns & various Penang vegetable dishes are also great but I didn't eat them~what I don't recommend is the mango pudding outta the fridge, it's not well made :(~When all tucked in, just look at the table number and go to the cashier to pay
5
Good buffet lunch. Especially char kway teow. One of the better ones in singapore. Value for money lunch buffet
4
This modest little place has a wonderful selection of Malaysian and Singaporean style delights. We were there as a big group with plenty of selections and plenty of it! Not flash decor but really nice food.
4
Every dish is so... tempting except No Penang Assam Laksa Bubor cha Cha is abit diluted. Overall it's worth it. We really enjoyed it on Valentine Day.
4
The food was quite interesting as I am a babas. The char Kuay teow was indeed good! Worth to eat! Pricing was reasonable too.
5
I liked the local flavour and generous amount of ingredients used in the dishes, eg whole prawns used in dishes, juicy chunks of meat in satay. Have gone there twice with friends, not crowded for dinner on weekdays so its a nice place to talk. Also perfect for bringing overseas friends to have a taste of local fare
4
I would say this is one of the better place to have Penang buffet in Singapore. MUST try- Prawn Noodle, Nasi Lemak, Char Kway Teow. Laksa is so-so. Dessert is not to me taste bud. Well.... most of my friends simply love this restaurant, affordable place with a decent spread
5
We were taken to Penang Place in Fusionoplis Way Connexis in Singapore and I have to say this is the best Penang food outside of Penang itself. I cannot advise you of the cost of the meal as someone else paid for it. It had to be the best food we have eaten anywher in Singapore or Penan
3
I hope the management will take note if they wish to have regular customers as if you change we will notice. Positives: a wide variety of Penang origin food. Enjoyed the nasi-lemak with lovely sambal and dried shrimps. Great "char kway teow" with prawns and fish cakes (keep it up). Good selection of prawn, beef, chicken Nyonya/Malay spicy dishes. Cuttlefish, prawn Mee, "Loh-Bak", "Rojak" or Malay fruit salad in shrimp paste. Make your own chendol or "ais-kachang".Could be better, hence 3 star not 5: The kitchen need to work harder to place popular food that finish especially, satay and the sauce and "char kway teow".So over to you, once you lose your regulars, no turning back

Penang is an island best known as Malaysia’s unofficial food capital. After many trips to Penang, I am hooked on the food and this restaurant is as good as being there.The buffet line was quite expansive – 30 specialties. There’re hits and misses, with the Penang Fried Koay Teow faring very very well, while the desserts and Assam Laksa less so. This is a no pork no lard restaurant, but the char koay teow, is a winner – not oily but equally fragrant with that smoky flavour as any others around and topped with generous amounts of fresh and big sized prawns and cockles. The nasi lemak was just ok. The rice was not particularly fragrant but the rending was very tender, though a tad too spicy. The curry chicken is also a must try. The assam laksa was a DIY station but sad to say, this dish was not up to par. I actually enjoyed DIY-ing my own rojak because I decide what goes into the mix: cucumber, pineapple, guava and starfruit.Being an ex-Malaysian, I would say this is the closest to authentic Penang food you will get in Singapore. I had to waddle out of the restaurant stuffed to the eyeballs, moaning that I could never, ever, possibly eat another thing. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyti.wordpress.com
4
This is a buffet style dining of a wide variety of Peranakan / Penang food. You will be spoilt for choice and the chef quickly replenishes when a tray is empty. The char kway teow ( fried rice noodles) was very good with freshly cooked prawns, the rendang (beef) was moist and tender. Lots of choices but save some space for dessert too. Be spoilt for choice like nonya dessert or chendol. A great place for friends, families and tourists
3
Two of us for lunch, me a fishy laksa and my colleague a beef rendang, with two cool barley drinks for $26. Speedy service and tasty too, even for my Western palate!
4
Can get noisy when crowded but family dinners are like that anyway.
Good spread of Malaysian food. Love the satay and fried kuay teow.
4
If you are in the area give this a try – really very good value buffet with a good range of options. Helpful staff and see what you think of the interesting wall decorations
3
The lunch buffet costs $23.90. Since I can't eat spicy food, I didn't get to try most of the assam dishes (assam laksa, assam fish etc). There's only a few non-spicy choices.I liked the herbal duck soup, which I thought was excellent. It had just the right amount of salt and pepper. The rendang was tender, tasty and not too spicy. Also liked the prawn paste chicken wings which were delicately flavoured without being overpowering.The DIY stations for ice kacang and rojak were idiot-proof and fun to play with. The buffet doesn't include drinks. However, with ice kacang easily available, I don't think you need them
4
Range of Penang delicacies to choose from the buffet table. Char Kuay Teow and Assam Laksa are must try dishes. DIY Chendol and Ice Kanchang were fun to create with your favourite ingredients. Only drawback would be no drinks (hot/cold) included in the buffet menu (additional purchase if you want). Would be better and worth the $$ if it was inclusive
5
A wide range of different Malaysian/Singaporean/Chinese food but at a high price if you have a small appetite. You will need to eat at least 2 platefuls to make it worthwhile. There is car parking and accessible by MRT or bus. This is our favourite restaurant whenever we go back to Singapore for its Nonya foods. It is a place where you can savour all your favourites in one location. The taste is pretty authentic with a self service element when you can mix your rojak, ice kachang and laksa - these can cost up to S$9 for a fixed quantity elsewhere. Other food we ate this time in 2014 included: cuttlefish/spring glory, Nonya kueh, beef rendang, fried king prawns, fried rice, fried noodles. spicy fish steaks, duck soup, achat, red bean dessert, oat type dessert, lotus seed pau, siu mai, lobak, frozen desserts, ice cream, chendol, salad, fresh fruits. Ice water is free but other drinks are payable. The unlimited buffet cost $28 pp (for approx. 3 hours) but one can order single dishes. As a deterrent for food wasters, any left over, uneaten food will be charged at $5 per 100 gm - so don't be greedy !!! Important tip - eat first and order your drinks later if there's still stomach room
2
The title says it all. This is the kind of place that in the US would be called GIANT CHINA BUFFET and would cost $12.95. Here, for two diners drinking only water, the dinner bill was an eye-watering S $68.00. This included a FULL Singapore service charge. For a buffet restaurant. What a gyp.For all this money you get an assortment of rather ... Ordinarily conceived versions of Malay dishes. Imagine GIANT CHINA BUFFET having "Malay Night" and you get the idea. The Beef Rendang in particular was disappointing. Rendang done properly is a tender, rich, spicy delight of Malay cuisine. The Penang Place version was tough, gristly, rubbery, and just all around bad - about as authentic a Malay dish as General Tso's Chicken is authentic Chinese.General Tso, however, doesn't cost seventy bucks for two people. And that's the thing. If these Chinese-Playing-Malays charged a reasonable price for what is very average food, I'd be much less irritated by the whole thing. As it is, Penang Place gets the Carolina BBQ Boy Thumbs Down: RIPOFF. Stay Away
4
This place is amazing. We were taken here by family who live in Singapore and who frequently take visitors here due to the quality and variety of food on offer. The buffet has around 20 items and the quality of food is high. The price is of course higher than hawker stalls but considering the sheer variety and quality of food available represents very good value. Would highly recommend for anyone who loves this type of food. Would recommend going early at lunchtime as it gets really crowded around 12 and they come around just before 2 to say that the buffet will be closing soon and that the food will no longer be replenished. The kids loved the make-your-own ice kachang station
4
This place offers a bit of everything (salads, main dishes, dim sum, snacks, soup, finger food,desserts). I won't say the spread is elaborate but there's a bit of everything (anyway, how much can one eats?). The food taste quite nice as well and the ambience is causal, service was also quite up to mark. The price is pretty affordable. So if you want a 'simpler' buffet, this is not a bad choic
4
Penang Place is one of the great place that serves authentic flavours of penang cuisine that value for money.The buffet has a wide spread of dishes that makes me crave for more......especially char kway teow, assam laksa, different types of nonya kuet, desserts ......the food is GREAT! Really great value for money! The location is at the west side of Singapore but it never stop me for going....it's my 4th visit now!http://www.penangplace.com/index.ht
4
Great variety of char kway teow, rojak, herbal duck soup (bit lacking in flavour), kueh pie tee, rendang, kueh. Noisy happy environment. Reserve a seat in advance on Saturday nights. Buffet only on Saturday night.
5
I first went to Penang Place Restaurant in July 2012, a treat by my colleague. First time there, we loved the food so much that we decided to bring our family to try out this restaurant.I subsequently went another 3 time, twice in March 2013. The food is great. They are generous with their ingredients. I love the century egg porridge which is cooked with big chunks of century egg.The char kway teow is delicious too, with big prawns and squid in it. They don't serve a big portion, rather, they top up quite frequently. Nasi lemak is quite nice, with a bowl of boiled lady finger served aside, which is rarely seen in restaurant.Shrimp paste chicken wings are usually served in the beginning of the buffet. Then comes the chicken satay which you can see the customers 'snapping up' everytime it was topped up. They must have loved it.Going there for Saturday lunch, I realised that they also served some food for kids - french fried, nuggets, sausages and chicken fillet (which is tasty).Keep stomach space for the desserts. I once tried the pumpkin kueh with coconut milk on top. It was sweet but tasty.I recommend this place for gathering too, a relaxing place to chit chat and catch up with friends
5
Went to Penang Place for their dinner buffest two weeks ago, am craving for their Char Kway Teow right now. Excellent dishes were the Char Kway Teow, Hokkien Prawn Noodle Soup, Ngoh Hiang, Penang Laksa. The other stuff was just so-so. Comparable to the Penang Buffet in Copthorne Kings Hotel in quality, but cheaper
4
this is where you should go if you have craving for penang food. the assam laksa is delicious as well as their fried kway teow. the satay sticks "fly off" the plate the minute they are placed by the staff. there is also hokkien mee, which of course in penang food, is actually prawn mee. DIY rojak and kueh pie tee and dessert chengdol are available. leave room for nasi lemak and rendang. there are also a whole lot of other food like soup, porridge, spring roll, finger food selection, salad, vegi etc. don't miss the kueh which should be eaten together with kaya. cheng ting and bubur hitam are the hot desserts and the cold desserts are mango pudding, gui ling kao and fruits which are found in the fridge. the place can accommodate big groups which is great because not many places can cater to that. overall a very pleasant dining experience
4
This is an excellent place with good, fresh authentic Penang spicy food in Singapore. The environment is charming and well laid out. I would recommend the assam laksa, fried kway teow, nasi lemak and diy rojak. There was a good turn over of food and well topped up. Even for a busy Saturday night, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of the food. Dessert with the kueh-kueh, chedol, etc was superb.As an overseas visitor (and locals alike), I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for that Penang food experience! Enjo

Singaporeans love buffets. There aren't many penang food ones but this is one of them. The place itself i very large so it accomodates a lot of people. But I didn't find many really penang special food so much. And a lot of items seem to run out quickly (cause when it's running at full capacity which it usually is on weekends). The fried kwey tiao is good if you can get some (i waited 2 rounds!). The prawn noodles with soup was so so. I expected the soup to be thicker but it wasn't. The rojak is not bad (of course it's fix your own which is great really cause you can put whatever you want and leave out whatever you don't want). The place is quite well organized i must say just that I think speed to replenishing the food needs to be looked at. Quality of the food is ok. I do confess I prefer the penang buffet at the Princess Terrace at Copothorne King's hotel (pricier though

Had dinner there on 25th Oct with other true-blue Penang friends. I didn't expect the place to be so big, had a canteen-like and unpretentious ambience. It was full house but the young servers were rather efficient and friendly. One of the better table service that I have encountered in a long time in Singapore! Detailed breakdown:Lor bak - it was nice, but lacked that crispy edge to the skin. The 'lor' wasn't gooey enough to get 100 marks, but overall taste was 90 marks.Char Koey Teow - main star with loads of fresh prawns, taste was good but lack that 'big fire' wok taste. 95 marksAssam Laksa - very sweet and the gravy was too watery. 70 marks.Chilli crab - a surprising feature as this is not really a Penang star, but a generous feature to the overall dining experience. Gravy could have been less sweet and spicier. 80 marks.Rojak - lacked the oomph factor, the sauce could have been thicker and spicier too. 80 marks.Kiam Chye Ark Soup - disappointing. It just tasted sour and stopped there, lacked of flavours of a well-brewed stock.Pulut Hitam - this, I give 100 marks. A little salt added to the santan would have blended the sweetness better, but this was a star. Satay - very good, thick and generous chunks. Again, lacked that 'burnt' edge that one would only get on charcoal grills. 90 marks. Mango pudding - 35 marks, it tasted synthetic. Gwai Lin Gou - 50 marks, tasted more like grass jelly. Overall, it was ok, just that I wouldn't rave about it and proclaim it the most authentic Penang food dining place

The crowd gathered before opening. Once opened, the reception efficiently showed us to our table. As we talked o our table, we saw the buffet spread of delicious and hot Penang food. There is about 20 different varieties of penang food. Char Koay Teow is a hot favorite. Once finished, the chef will cook and new tray. Nasi lemak, lor bak, satay, prawn noodles, kang kong and cuttlefish etc. Just a lot of food. Pace you or you'll miss the Penang laksa, curry noodles. Overall, a good place to enjoy Penang food. Must go. Must make reservation.

The reviews of this restaurant written up till now were likely of the facility before the move to the current location at B1 of Fusionopolis. I'm not sure if there's been a change of ownership, but I will only be reviewing the Penang Place that is at the time of this review located at the first basement level of Fusionopolis. It is easy to get to by MRT. Stop at One North station on the Circle Line, take the escalators up to level B1 of Fusionopolis and Penang Place should be staring you in the face.It's buffet dining. I recommend going for lunch. Although dinner is busier, you will not need to wait for a table. Reservations would be a good idea although not strictly necessary. I would recommend the following dishes that are definitely worth trying on your first visit or if you only have time to visit once. Penang Fried Noodles (Penang Char Kway Teow). This is easily the signature dish at Penang Place. This dish is definitely the product of ample wok hei, where the wok is very hot and the noodles are flash fired with the seafood and fresh vegetables. There is a brief dance of joy and the wok hei will subtly reveal itself in the al dente noodles, the crunchy prawns, tender squid slices and bean sprouts that snap. This is no mean feat and a fried kway teow lives and dies by this one thing. When wok hei is absent, the result is a soggy mass of anonymity. The Penang fried kway teow at Penang Place manages to showcase this culinary standard very nicely, and for me this is not just a great Penang kway teow, this is a great fried kway teow, period. I would even go so far as to recommend that visitors with not much time in Singapore, stop by at Penang Place where they can have a very strong example of fried kway teow and also sample other local staples, all in one time-efficient stop. You now have more time to spend sipping your slowly melting Singapore Sling slushie perched poolside atop MBS' skypark pool.Beef Rendang. The beef is tender and the sauce is richly pungent with turmeric, blue ginger and lemon grass. This may not be the BEST rendang, but if this is the first rendang you've ever had, then Penang Place's version will set the bar quite high for all future rendangs.Chicken Curry. The sauce is weighty and thickly flavored with a nice sea salt finish. Most other curries tend towards a soupy consistency, not with Penang Place's version. This is a nice thick curry that will coat, no soak into, the slice of french loaf that you dunk into it. The cream of the curry is an harmonious admixture of coconut cream and chicken fat perfectly and irreversibly bonded after hours of steeping. There are certainly better curries than the chicken curry at Penang Place, but not many.Penang Place at Fusionopolis is definitely worth a visit if you like char kway teow. For first time visitors to Singapore, this is an unlikely recommendation but entirely consistent with the Singaporean philosophy of dining which is that it should be about what you put in your mouth and much less about where this happens. You will find local food well represented at Penang Place and so worth visiting especially if you don't have enough itinerary for a full blown crawl through all the hawker haunts recommended by KF Seetoh or Anthony Bourdain

We paid without looking but after seeing the banner in front of the restaurant and asked the cashier. First he said the price included GST and service charge, but I pointed to him that GST and service charged are shown separately in the bill. Then he said oh then it is the dinner price!!!! We were stunned because we were there late and imagine there were how many people before us who paid for dinner without taking a look!The restaurant looks good from outside, but inside we feel like we are having food in the food court. We booked a table, but when we were there they just gave us an available table next to the wash basin. The value is not as good if compared with York hotel which offers good ambient with few dollars more expensive.Despite all this, char kway teow and assam laksa are very good, but some dish like chicken curry is below average
