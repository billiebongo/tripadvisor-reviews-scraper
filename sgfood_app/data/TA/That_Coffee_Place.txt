This is your neighborhood coffee shop. Whether you fancy chinese, malay or indian cuisine -- this cafe will serve your comfort food.
Our favorites: salted egg chicken, prawn paste chicken, mee goreng (seafood/chinese), sambal goreng (malay).

Nothing fanciful much but it's a reasonable price coffee shop in the quiet Neighbourhood. The aircon is cool and the service is fast.

Great place for a meal with your family if you stay nearby. They have Chinese food, Muslim food and more. Meals for one person to multi course meal for the family gathering. The prawn paste chicken and salted egg prawn are good.

The key advantage of this place is location next to compassvale mrt and no eatry nearby. Food options are good and taste is OK nothing different than what you get at food courts.

The place is located favorable just below the compassvale LRT. Nice place to grab you supper with limited choice of beer and drinks. The place has no wi- fi and the rates are on a little higher side. But the food quality is best and worth coming. It was my everyday destination for dinner and drinks with friends

Wide variety of yummy food for anytime of the day from 6am to almost midnight! Reasonably priced. Salted eggs was delicious, so was its claypot tofu. Good place for meals with friends and family. Comfy, air-conditioned and with good service. Will be back to try its nasi padang and coffee
