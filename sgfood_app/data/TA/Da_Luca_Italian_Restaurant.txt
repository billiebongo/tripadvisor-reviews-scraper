I have been to this restaurant several times now and it never disappoints. A gem. Big fan of the eggplant starter, especially.

Portions here are on the large side. Fresh and delicious pasta!
Prices are slightly steep and the atmosphere gives your hair and clothes a really bad smell after walking out. Dress casual. It can get really noisy when it's full house

Nice restaurant with good Italian food. We order day specialities and that was a good joyce. Frendly owner was busy but still had time for All tables.

Went for the uni pasta and it was not available. Minus the disappointment of not having what we went for, the service staff were untrained and ignorant. A simple task of refilling water for 3 pax, the staff can refill for only one glass and never returned. Food was ok, but service+good food is an overall package in my opinion? I am not expecting a world class service, but basic service is lacking. Management should seriously look into the training and actual service procedure

We had lunch with my parents at Da Luca and all of us enjoyed the dishes we ordered. For Starters we shared the Chilled Angel Hair Pasta with Scallops and Uni. This dish is very good but also very rich. I would recommend it as a sharing portion. We split ours four-ways because we planned to leave room for the dishes that followed.......Next was a raw Sicilian Prawn appetiser followed by the grilled octopus, then a Vongole Spaghetti to share. The octopus dish was a real winner!For the meat dish, we ordered the Fiorentina Steak and this was also very good! (you can check out my photos)Dessert was crispy Apple Pie and Tiramisu to share.Overall, a very good Italian restaurant. We will return and also recommend

We were introduced by our friends who live close bye. The entire experience exceeded expectations. A humble store front tucked away in a local neighborhood revealed a refined Italian dining experience. The nights menu included angel hair pasta, a selection of truffle inspired dishes, risotto, fresh-selection cod and elegant pork chop. If you're looking for an excellent, small neighborhood italian dining experience, then check them out

Have dinner there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The price is quite expensive. More into fine dining price.But the place quite old and the chair have no cushion.We ordered several dishes but to my surprise only angel hair pasta and grilled lamb are up to my my standard.Their truffle pasta is quite plain ( only pasta + sauce and truffle ).They also did not allowed us to cut our birthday cake bcoz they say no ouside food allowe
5
The title says it all - this was the best Wagyu t-bone I've had to date. Done to a perfect medium rare, the steak was flavorful and lovely with the crispy roasted potatoes and fresh corn on the side. We really enjoyed the stewed veal tripe as well, which was done in a simple tomato sauce with parmesan cheese. Service was personable and the ambience was rustic Italian charm at its finest. Will be back

Decent quality but overpriced food. Well-known for their crispy focaccia, tasty octopus, cold capellini in truffle emulsion with raw Hokkaido scallops and sea urchin. Service was poor. A staff said he will give us a chair for our bags, but he did not. So i placed my bag on the floor. The same person kicked my bag and gave a cursory apology. The staff seemed to give more attention to big groups or customers who ordered wine.

Dinner - for 2 Angel hair pasta, Japanese eggs with ham and truffle and tagliatelle Ragu. The angle hair pasta ($88SGD) was delicious. I remembered it was $36 SGD without the Uni option years back but the restaurant doesn't have that option anymore. It s delicious and it serves 2 people easily so definitely a hefty price to pay for one of the best cold angel hair pasta in the island. Eggs- $58 . Again it was very delicious and hats off to the Chef. We felt the truffle that was included did not elevate the taste. Mains - Ragu tagliatelle. This is where I would judge it s food. Their ragu which is a staple dish of any Italian restaurant loses out to its peers. There was not the warm home cook Italian feel. 3/5. We highly recommend u skip this option and go for the Risotto instead which was lovely when we tried that the first time we visited this restaurant. Overall it was a lovely meal. Kudos for the family for putting some extra gloss on their food and making it more profitable for the restaurant which we totally support. We will come again for sure but we ll have to save up

Had a pretty good meal at Da Luca Italian Restaurant. Their set lunch is quite reasonably price. The ambiance is quite romantic!

My husband and I were introduced to this restaurant by his nephew. Having frequented Italian restaurants in UK an Italy, I was pleasantly surprised to find an Italian fusion restaurant in Singapore serving such delicate and delicious food. The ambiance was buzzing. The service was excellent despite the place being full throughout. I was also impressed with their extensive wine list.We had the tasting menu so we were able to taste various dishes. The chef was also very accommodating and he changed some of the ingredients in some of the dishes to accommodate my sister-in-law who did not want to have seafood. We started off with the Chilled Capellini with truffle emulsion topped with Hokkaido Scallop & Uni. This was followed by the following dishes:- Wangyu Miyazaki Beef Carpaccio with Rucola & Marie Rose Salsa on Crispy Focaccia Chip- Pan seared Spanish Octopus with Sicilian tomato coulis & Squid Ink puree- Homemade tagliatelle with Alicia Boston Lobster in Sicilian Tomato Lobster Bisque- Deep fried "Elephant's Ear" Veal Milanese with piquant Arrabiata Salsa- Dolce Di Luca : Crispy Ialian Apple Tartlette with homemade vaniglia gelato We ended the dinner traditionally with a shot of Limoncello

This reminds me of Lucio Restaurant in South Kensington, London. Very much a residential area and the local restaurant patronised by the community. We were taken by Singaporean friends who consider this their favourite place for years. Coincidently we lived not far a few years back, and were put off this little patch by Novena because of the ex-patty/irish bar thing (boat quay rowdy) on the front but noticed it has since closed down!!. If we had known about this hidden nugget, we would have been there every week!! Very authentic, and as good as eaten in Italy! Beautiful home made el'dente pasta. Lamb and recommended carpaccio was scrummy. Chianti wonderful. The tiramisu gets a very high rating on the website, and deserves 6 stars. The apple crisp and molten chocolate pud with pistachio sauce was also fabulous. None of them were over sweet, home made and really freshly prepared in the kitchen that day. Put it this way, my husband who never orders dessert / not that interested … pretty much indulged and demolished the lot! Great food, excellent service and a warm friendly vibe patronised by local residents made for a really lovely way to finish off a busy week. The owners are there on the evening and very hands on, which is good to see

I have been to this restaurant for about 5 years now and the food is really of high quality but after all these years going there I must say that it is overpriced once I checked other Italian restaurants and it is not the first time that it happens but they will always overcharge you and add items to your bill... Had Wagyu Miyazaki which was good but when I went to eat it at another place I was shocked at the price difference. Then the bread supposed to be complimentary and one of my quest ate more bread and we requested more and I think they billed and extra side dish. It is not the first time they are doing that and last drop for me and this is why decided to write.You go there just enjoy the pasta and classic Italian food, for Wagyu steak go elsewhere as it is overpriced.Also be careful and check your bill and ask well as when I go with my friends we will eat like Chinese and share all and better check as they can charge you how many portion and you won't know. Had a truffle pasta to share for 3 and turned out to be $48. But it's okay as it is awesome.The only disappointment is the charging of additional bread - even after all these years sponsoring this restaurant it's a real disappointment and it's not the first time they are doing that.Finally I didn't throw away the bill....Bottom line don't eat steak there and just try truffle pasta... the rest stay away and not worth the price....

I'm a italian food lover and I did like the food but I think the doses were small and the food overpriced. The wine were super expensive but we still asked for a bottle. I order the gnocchi and it was very tasty. The desert was superb! The restaurant is vertical cozy and the staff, specially the owners, are very friendly.
3
Had lunch with the family. Ordered the daily special lunch set, the Alacarte Lasagna and a half order of Penne Bolognese for my son.This was a an average experience and the food was average. My Lasagna was brought and the top of it has a layer of melted (crispy) cheese. Underneath it it was burnt (you could taste it). Thank goodness for Lasagna being layers of pasta, I remove the first layer and saved it to show later. When my dish was picked up, no opportunity was there to complain nor did the wait staff look or ask how the meal was.se la vie..
4
Service couldn't be friendlier, the cooking is skilled and the food tasty. Is it exciting and new? No, but then that's not what you come here for. It's like visiting an old friend; reliable, comfortable and you know exactly what you're getting. In a very fast changing city, it is good to see places like this. Is it worth a detour? Well, nothing in Singapore is really much of a detour, is it
5
This is my 4th Visit to Da Luca Restaurant. This time round, I ordered the Cold Angelhair pasta with Scallop, Caviar and Japanese Uni. The Angelhair pasta is superb with the excellent combination of scallops and Uni. The scallop simply melts in your mouth.I ordered the Lamb Chop as my Main Course. The 3 pieces of lamb chops are grilled to perfection. Sides include steam vegetables and grilled potato cubes.My wife ordered the black Ink Linguinie with Prawns and my daughter had Bolognese Spagetti.For Desert, the apple tart is a very unique and tastefully presented.I would say this resturant serves one of the Best Italian Foods in town in a Cozy Environment.You definitely have to call and book a table.

Came here to celebrate a friend's bday. Food is generally good but extremely overpriced. Would not come again. We had a (small serving for 2) of Japanese egg burrata cheese with shaved truffle for appetizer ($67.86), Cold angel hair scallop pasta w truffle oil ($79.56), lamb chops ($44.46), braised rabbit pasta ($32.76), one of us had a glass of wine ($23.28). Total bill came up to $247.17. It's not uncommon to be charged this amount for Italian food but for the ambience, location and portion, it was really overpriced especially the burrata cheese with truffle. No doubt food is good but not worth the price. Would not patronize this place again. Another friend i know is a regular here, he said the prices did increase. Egg burrata used to be $20/pax and cold pasta scallop used to be $48. Twenty dollars price jump per dish is too much
4
One of my former work colleagues suggested we try this Italian in their neighbourhood- a simple taxi ride away from where we were staying.It looks and feels like a traditional Italian restaurant like you could imagine in any Italian city. The menu is interesting and the staff excellent We had a mixture of starters to share and in hindsight we probably went overboard - but the main course of Salt Baked Sea bass is outstanding.We had a very good evening catching up with a friend from my old employer and enjoying some great Italian hospitalit

Fine dining prices for mid range Italian food.
It is in an odd location for a restaurant that serves a lot of truffle. But truffle alone does not fine dining make.
Caprese salad is a cold dish. So why was my plate hot?
4
Cozy, homely ambience that is fairly loud as it is usually full; friendly, warm service; great food. Loved our dinner. A bit pricey, but definitely looking forward to coming back!

Was told about a little restaurant called Da Luca and decided to go there without reservations. The deco is simple and rustic, reminds you of Florence and we were quickly seated since we are customers #2 at 6:05pm!We were introduced the "specials" and seriously, everything sounds too good. We decided to ask for help on what to order and was recommended the following:1. Cold starter: Capellini with Hokkaido Scallop and Uni with black truffle;2. Hot starter: Spanish Octopus3. Main: Moroccan Prawn PastaCapellini:When the capellini came, it was split into 2 portion and you will expect small portion. Wrong! The portion is a good size one!The Uni is sweet and the capellini with truffle is very flavorful, I gulped down the pasta! The Hokkaido Scallop texture is great, however, the taste is overpowered by the truffle. But still, a good start!Spanish Octopus:This is flavorful. I missed this dish in Florence and the tomato is sweet with black ink sauce + tomato sauce.Pawn Pasta:The presentation is simple but the Moroccan pawn is split in 2, beautiful grilled and the meat texture is smooth and buttery! The homemade pasta is thin and excellent in tomato sauce. I am not usually a tomato sauce fan but this is excellent!Ok, move on to dessert. We chose the Crispy Apple Tart instead of Tiramisu. When the tart came, it's a strip of biscuit with a scope of ice cream, slices of strawberry and vanilla sauce. I thought, how good could it be! One cut on the strip, I saw Apple fillings oozing out and when I put into the mouth, it's heavenly. The crispy texture, nuts, Apple fillings all come together in a symphony. This is one of the best dessert I ever had! The ice cream is excellent!Lastly, we finished off with a cup of Macchiato and this lived up to every expectation of a good coffee! Very close to Florence memories of a good coffee!It's so good, we made another reservation in the same week to try other food on the menu
4
came here for christmas dinner with friends. i had to say, the food were really good. The items listed in the christmas menu was not in the usual dinner menu. i can't remember the details, but it certainly was delicious. However, the price is a bit on the high side. Meanwhile the ambiance of this place is definitely not fine dining, it's more like a casual italian place. Nevertheless, i will come back agai
5
Really love the crab meat penne here! Have tried others too - in general their pasta sauces are really fragrant, while the ones with cheese can be quite strong. Cold angelhair pasta with uni, scallops, and truffle has a pretty strong taste, but it's one of their signature dishes. Highly recommend their pistachio gelato - very authentic and very nutty! The colour and texture both reflect that it's homemade. Tastes like the ones I had in the REAL gelato places in Italy (not the fluffed up ones which are fake gelato)
5
Had their set lunch last Thur. Simple atmosphere and decent service. Staff introduced their specials for the day but I wanted to stick to my Budget. Had the most wonderful lunch with my Wife. Food served is fresh and quality is TOP Notched. Had the best Creme Bulee in my life and I don't even like Creme Bulee in the first place. Stuck to set lunch and drank complimentary water. Spent closed to $60 SGD. Well worth every penny. Btw, it's close to Novena MRT which is close to town. Tourists should come here too if you're craving for some authentic Italian food.
4
The place is not big and not luxurious, but the food is superb. Owner is there to help you and very friendly. Food is served quickly. Make sure you try the Chilled Angel Hair Pasta tossed in Truffle Emulsion topped with raw Hokaido Scallop, Hokaido Uni and Oscietra Caviar for starter, and then have the Sea Bass for your main course
5
Started with the Parmigiana and Burrata. The Parmigiana was delectable and rich while the Burrata was one of the smooth and creamy I have ever eaten.I had the homemade tagliatelle with wild mushroom and minced beef sauce. The food was so good and with really healthy quantities. Also tried my friend's gnocchi and it was excellent. Truly, one of the best italian places and great value for money
5
Food excelent, with real italian taste , in one month i've been there four times with work colleagues. I suggest Risotto ai Funghi and Fiorentina Steak with Amarone red wine. Hui, wife of chef Luca, is a perfect hostess and with staff guys help you to have a fantastic Italian food and wine experience

We made a reservation for 5 people at 8.30pm and went promptly at 8.30pm to be seated. The restaurant was running full house and we were informed our table wasn't ready. We asked how long the wait was going to be and was given the reply by the hostess "I'm gonna close the door now. Your table isn't ready. I'll let you know when it is" and got physically chased out of the restaurant to wait. After a 30 minutes wait, the hostess came out and asked if we wanted any drinks and said she would get chairs taken out as the tables weren't ready. The chairs never came out (even though another party of 5 had a gentleman on crutches) though appetizers kept coming out even after we rejected the second plate onwards. After numerous times of asking the staff how long the wait was going to be, no one got back to us and we were kept in limbo not knowing whether our table was coming soon or whether we should go elsewhere to celebrate our friend's birthday. We finally got seated at 9.40pm, 70 minutes after waiting, with throbbing headaches from the waiting and hunger. Even when we got the table, the waiter joked and asked our two parties of 5 to "long cham paz" on who should get the table first. When we finally got seated, plates and cutlery were all over the table, we had no napkins too. The waiter serving us sensed our displeasure and instead of promptly ordering us bread and water, and taking our order, he decided to give us a lecture on how we should cool down and not show him an attitude. Despite how he appeared to have ordered bread for us, it came after the appetizers.The rest of the food came and was beautifully done. They did service recovery by giving us a complimentary dessert and a half bottle of moscato. However, no apology was being made and throughout our dinner duration of 1.5 hours, the hostess made it to every table except ours, as if to avoid the confrontation. We would have gladly paid for the dishes because there is no point in a service recovery if the service lapse hasn't been addressed. At the end of the night, my headache from waiting hadn't faded and anger hadn't simmered. Ironically, when we left we found chairs outside the restaurant when it should have been brought out about 3 hours ago. The staff explained that the earlier patrons had came late, however, Da Luca has been around for a while and should have been able to manage the timing much better. If they committed to a 8.30pm slot they should have the table by 8.45pm. As the common practice for restaurants are that if patrons come in after 15 minutes grace period, the table would be released. Overall it was very disappointing because such a well-established restaurant should have been able to turn a bad situation into a neutral or a positive one but no attempts were made. The food was better than average but the service is lacking and I won't see us returning because of that
5
Nice ambience and very good food at a very fair price. My favourite dish was the Fettuccine ragù but my friends loved the Ravioli stuffed with meat in a succulent mushrooms sauce. Great job Chef Luca.
5
The menu outside looks so normal but this place is always full - there must be something special. Finally got in and the place was absolutely thriving and bustling. The service was amazing. And then they had the special menu and that was spectacular. The slow boiled egg with burata and truffles was very rich. The uni, scallopp and truffles emulsion was SPECTACULAR - no skimping on ingredients - only the best ingredients in quantity. There was also octopus starters and a phenomenal lobster main dish. Place was not at all cheap but one pays for what one gets and it was really memorable
5
After spending a couple weeks in Tuscany this year, I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a wonderful gem near Novena. Owned and operated by husband and wife, Hui and Luca, this restaurant focuses on top quality products and traditional cooking styles. Flavors were full and properly portioned. My guest and I had the tasting menu with a bottle of Brunello. While the entire meal was delicious, the two starters stole the show for me. The first was cold angel hair pasta with uni, scallop, and truffle oil. The second starter was a burrata with a slow cooked egg, and sliced truffles on top. Truly a delight. I only wish I got a chance to also try the tripe appetizer. The tasting menu was also rounded out with half a fresh lobster and perfectly cooked slices of a5 wagyu beef. Dessert was a crisp apple tart. I would definitely come back and bring some friends. Worth checking out. Prices are not cheap, but they are well worth the value and quality. I find too many people in Singapore complain about the price of food as compared to many of lower price point options. However, it is always wonderful to see a place that produces high quality without having to gouge people like they do in the more touristy areas (CBD, Raffles, MBS area). highly recommended
5
This is my 5th visit to Da Luca and it has never fail me. Chef Luca offers the freshest and most delicious pasta options one can find in Singapore. There are too many signatures to highlight and as many reviews indicated- the truffle pasta with uni is an experience not to be missed. Their seasonal menu option is also one to look out for. It is ironic how the recently awarded Singapore Michelin Italian restaurants can hardly stack up to Da Luca's service and food quality. This is definitely an all time favourite. A great venue for first date, business or family

I heard about this restaurant awhile ago but did not go so when this place was chosen for a group dinner I was looking forward to trying it. I must say that I was very happy with the overall experience here and that I will be back for sure. As we were a group we were informed that we we would to have the chefs menu and not order alacarte. The selection we got was very good and filling. From the cold pasta (with caviar) to the risotto (with truffles) and the lamb and wagyu beef we were all very impressed. There is an ok wife list but you can also bring your own (1 for 1 or corkage ). The service here is also very good and we will be coming back again - good experience overall.
4
We made a reservation not quite knowing what to expect, except that the location seemed convenient and parking easy. The restaurant is in Goldhill square, which was probably built in the 60's, and has a warm vibe. Staff were also friendly and polite. We ordered the papardelle with braised duck and the squid ink linguine with seafood, both were absolutely delicious, if a little messy to eat. Each dish was $25 and with tax, came up to $59 in total. Not exactly cheap. If the pasta was between $18 and $20, i would have given it 5 stars.
4
There is a reason everyone is raving about the cold truffle pasta with uni and scallop - because it really is that good! So are most of the pastas on the menu. Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side for what is essentially a neighbourhood joint, but you're paying for the quality and the amazing taste. Service can be erratic which I think has a lot to do with the lack of staff (this is a problem truly plaguing the f&b industry in Singapore), but the manager/owner makes up for it by being thoroughly engaging and chatty. This place is well worth repeat visits
4
It was my first time to try cold angel hair pasta but it was served with raw scallop slices, caviar and sea urchin roe and tasted delicious (I believe this dish has to be pre ordered) They use a lot of white truffle on other dishes and the gnocchi is interesting. Setting is average, but very busy, and they do sharing portions so you can enjoy more options as a couple or with friend
5
My girlfriend and I had just returned from a summer holiday in Europe and had been struggling to find food in Singapore on par to the quality we had there. One night, she had a craving for Italian food, and we decided to give Da Luca a try.Upon stepping into the homely, authentic interior of the restaurant, situated in the unassuming row of restaurants at Goldhill Plaza in Novena, we were greeted the overwhelming fragrance of truffles. "We have both white and black truffles in season," the hostess and wife of head chef Luca told us. "So you can try one in your appetiser, and the other kind in your pasta." Sounds good, we thought! But were we to be upset as we had been at other lacklustre European establishments in Singapore? Absolutely not - it only gets better. We figured the best way to sample a chef's cooking is to order the daily specials... and boy, did it deliver! We ordered:1) Black truffle capellini with Hokkaido scallops and Uni (sea urchin)2) Japanese onsen egg with jamon chips, fresh burrata and black truffle3) Miyazaki A3 Wagyu beef carpaccio with rocket and shaved Parmigiano4) Miyazaki A3 Wagyu steak on grill5) Luca's special homemade Apple tart with gelato6) Homemade molten chocolate cake with pistachio lava and gelatoFrom the moment the first appetiser arrived, we already knew this was going to be an awesome meal. Each strand of chilled angel hair pasta was coated in fragrant truffle and covered in black truffle bits, and the Uni and scallops were as fresh as touted to be. Winning combination of creamy flavors and textures!We thought two truffle dishes might be overkill - but the burrata and onsen egg appetiser proved to be a different spin and absolutely worth ordering. The egg and fresh cheese cut through the saltiness of the jamon for the ultimate umami. The piece de resistance of the meal was of course... the steak. At this point, we were already starting to fill up from the hearty portion sizes (the most generous we've seen in Italian restaurants in sg!) but who can resist the buttery creaminess of excellently done Wagyu steak? Every single piece was perfectly seared. (We didn't even have to say "medium rare" - apparently the Chef already knew, and there's only one way to eat Wagyu!)The deserts were great too! But enough reading. Just remember to make a reservation in advance as they are usually completely booked out, especially on Fridays and weekends.
5
It's not on the regular menu but it is a great reason to patronise this restaurant. We ordered a 1.5 main size to share between 3 people and helpfully the chef prepared it in 3 separate portions each with own scallops and Uni beautifully places on top. Substantial truffle flavour on cool angel hair pasta, delicious. I would give this restaurant a 5/5 as a reason to visit for this dish aloneWe also ordered the 300GM burrata for starters and it fed four of us satisfyingly. Creamy fresh burrata paired with sautÃ©ed spinach and slices of tomato dressed in balsamic. Simple way to start the meal. The pork main and salt baked Italian sea bass were also shared and flavourful. Tiramisu was simple and had the signature coffee kick that signified the end of a good meal.Be realistic about expectations here. On a Friday or Saturday night of course service may not be 100% but we had no issues on a weekday night. The only con I'd mention is it is pricey for a casual gathering of friends over a good meal but the service we got and standard of food was near worth the dollars so it's worth spending an evening. It's an intimate setting with professional servers who are attentive and welcoming, great for a weeknight gatherin
5
Good location to catch up with friends over lunch at Da Luca restaurant.
Enjoyed the set meal with excellent service by friendly staff.
5
Was a wonderful experience, great food. Great ambience. The host is very involved and caring. She took special care of the children and my son says it's the best gelato he's ever eaten
5
fabulous food. Very reasonably priced. Truffle pasta amazing! Staff are so friendly. It's the closest thing to Tuscany this side of Europe. Thanks Luca. Amazing family experience!
3
Ladies night out last night and went back to Da Luca for dinner after a long hiatus on one of the Ladies' suggestion. Although the food was fresh and we had some seafood, I felt it was very pricey as we paid s$370 for 2 appetisers, 3 main courses (admittedly 1 main course was a whole salt baked sea bass) and 2 desserts. No drinks except warm water which was complimentary. Service was average with the 2 waiters taking turns to drop cutlery!! Owner was ultra friendly and tried her best to cope with full house. Need to spruce up the place a bit I feel if they charge these prices and up the ante on the service
5
My first visit to Da Luca and it did not disappoint. The food was mouth watering from the get go. From the appetizers to the mains to the dessert. We wiped our plates clean. It's definitely a place I will go to again and a place I will recommend to others. The host, Yong Hui, is very hands on and knowledgeable. She went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and had great recommendations for us
5
We've visited 'Da luca' a few times and each occasions has been as special. It's all about the food and the overall experience. The owners put real heart in the place and we've always felt taken care of. The menu is quite creative and each dish is special. They've taken pizza's off the menu but I'm hopeful they come back... Will give me a reason to go back even more often.
5
Words aren't going to be enough to praise this restaurant for its amazing food and even more amazing people - staff and guests. Not only do you get value for money for food, you get an exponential value add for people like Luca and his gracious wife Hui who run the establishment. Must try: anything with truffle and the Wagyu carpaccio! #yummyinmytummy
5
Got a treat for lunch today at this lovely cosy restaurant and the pasta was excellent - I had the set lunch and the cream meat linguini in tomato cream sauce was excellent must go back to try the Angel hair with scallops which is apparently excellent as it comes highly recommended
4
Tonight we ordered the special that was tomato soup as starter and morocco prawn pasta and cod fish as mains. The foods exceptionally good tonight. I was here several times before but never as good as the recommended specials. The bread also marvelous that we couldn't help it to order another served.
5
My wife was looking forward a second time to their heavenly trinity of Uni, Truffle and Caviar pasta. It will not disappoint you if you are a fan of all 3 of them. I ordered the king crab pasta and its was delicious. The crab meat was tender and fresh. Service was not an issue to me even though it was a busy weekend night. Hui was friendly and introduced us the specials. I am sure she won't hesitate to answer any of your queries in the menu.Agree that price is steeper if you choose the premium ingredients but the overall experience is still worth it. A great place to be if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of town area

Good Italian food at fair price, but wish they had better service.
Just not very responsive. Overall, it's just ok. I can get better service in my own kitchen
1
I have been to this restaurant twice now. The service constantly lets it down. We waited so long to get our water topped up. There were large gaps between service of the different courses and no apology. The music was incredibly loud and we had to ask to have it turned down. Despite explaining that I didn't like truffle oil a dish came out covered in it ! All in all there are far better, more pleasant Italian food experiences to be had in Singapore
2
Was here for a celebration, the food was good but they have too many protocols to follow which leaves no room for negotiation e.g. (1) we were asked to take on the chef's special menu for sharing which not everyone likes everything but still paying the same price and doesn't allow us to order individual portion from the menu. (2) There were dietary restrictions for some of us and the staff was aware and said they'll take note and prepare the portion separately. however when the dish came, they were all for common sharing with no special arrangement for those with dietary restriction (3) we didn't order enough wines from them to meet their 1 for 1 free corkage policy and the staff insisted numerously that we have to buy additional bottles from them to make up the numbers even though we offered to pay for the additional corkage
4
Full on a Tuesday night! Service was slow and lacking in several aspects. The pasta was served before the breads were delivered. I had to refill the wines myself. The saving grace was the food. Really delicious. The chilled angel hair pasta with truffles, caviar and scallop was such a flavourful dish. The baked eggs with burrata, chorizo and truffles was a harmonious hot pan of creaminess and yolkiness. To end off the meal, the chocolate pistachio brownie was a huge piece of molten cake paired with smooth hazelnut gelato. I would come back for these again, but service would really need to be reflected upon
5
I am a European expat living in Singapore. I frequent Da Luca both for private evenings as well as business lunches. I just have to go back. The restaurant is owned and run by Chef Luca who is doing magic with simple Italian dishes added with Asian flavours offering me a taste of home with the added Asian flair. The dishes and wines are very affordable (20++ for 3-course lunch). Price - quality is excellent.Highly recommendedAnd do n

Dined at this unassuming and cosy restaurant with a group of very good friends recently. I was blown away by the high quality food and the extremely friendly and attentive staff, including Hui whom I believe is the lady boss. Will certainly return with friends and family very soon
5
Da Luca serves up delicious hearty Italian food. The handmade noodles are prepared just right, and served with unusual (for Singapore) meats such as rabbit. The service is also very good. We go there often and don't even have to order our wine because they know what we like. Da Luca's cold angel hair pasta with scallops and wagyu carpaccio are two of their specials and are truly indulgent and decadent. The restaurant is usually busy so it's best to make a reservation, especially on Fridays and Saturdays for dinner

Ordered 2 take away pastas and a Parma ham. Was given 3 boxes so I did not check that my order was correct. It was only when I left that I realised they had given me 1 pasta only. Before this when I called to order, it was difficult to understand the waiter on the phone so I reiterated few times that I wanted 3 items and he noted. That's the first disappointment. When I noted my missing order, I called back the restaurant and again was received by the same waiter whom again I could not understand what he was saying on the phone. This could be due to his accent so I asked if I could talk to the other lady working in the restaurant but he refused to pass the phone to her. Second disappointment. He was rude and not helpful at all. Exasperated, I hung up the phone and decided to give up on having my lunch. About 30 mins later the female staff called back to tell me that they've got my order wrong ( surprised it took them so long to realise) AND that they have overcharged me for my first pasta instead. Third disappointment. So I had to make my way back to collect the extra amount that they charged me. Took me extra time and petrol + parking charges to go all the way back and the waiter was not even apologetic at all. Only apologized when I pointed him out and asked if he was the rude waiter that was on the phone with me but no offer of apologies was given to me at all. In summary, decent food but service is bad enough to spoil the dining experience. Will be able to get decent food like theirs elsewhere too.

Stumbled upon this place while scrolling through the www for a nice casual Italian restaurant and it proved to be a really precious find. The food is very authentic and they only serve Italian wines that make great complements to go with the lovely cuisine.My wife and I shared a super creamy burrata mozzarella cheese .. It was so fresh and very generous in size.. Later I had the pappadelle with duck while my wife had a simple but beautiful parmigiana. We shared two glasses of wine and then decided to have another (yet an old mistake) and the sweet waitress was kind and knowing enough to change the order into a carafe alrogether. Service is very personable and the waitress (queen I think her name was) made an effort through the night to engage us and find out a little bit more about us, making us feel more than just customers. That was very much appreciated and made our night really special. I would recommend this spot for delicious Italian food and cosy service staff who actually care if you're having a nice time or not. Thank you deluca

Great mix of Italian dishes, my family if five all love this place which is rare for us. We all have a favorite here
Staff if friendly and prompt, and the wine never seems to stop flowing

Had dinner there last night for the second time.Beautiful Italian food, good wine list and great service. Would recommend for a casual local Italian restaurant.

Went there today with some friends. The restaurant is slightly hidden due to its location on the far side of Goldhill Plaza. The initial impression was that it was slightly upmarket type of restaurant, but the attitude of the waiters was somewhat of a let down from the first moment you entered the restaurant. Firstly, none of the staff came forward to we attending offered drinks, it was clear he was not happy we did not want the fancy stuff and only requested tap water.The food itself wasn't bad. We had the set lunch which was quite good value at $20. The starter was quite good in fact. I had the slowly cooked eggs. Interesting and quite tasty. The penne carbonara was tasty but rather too salty. We finished up with a small serving of tiramisu.While the food was decent and in fact quite tasty, the service was dour and almost grudging. Quite a let down. Would we go back?Probably not

Ordered 2 appetizers, angel hair with scallop cold dish (sprinkle with truffles), and beef carpaccio on crispy bread. 1st time trying out raw beef, and it was just simply yummy! It was not bloody, and it definitely went well with the crispy bread. I Love the angel hair with scallop! Though it was served cold, it has a memorable flavour and the truffles fragrance mingled well into the dish. Main dish for me was Vongole. Well, I simply finished the whole plate even though I was already almost full from the delicious appetizers. Definitely will be coming back to this restaurant again. The food are great and the prices are affordable

I went here with my boyfriend last time in November. This restaurant is totally hidden and small but I'm glad we went to have dinner here. We ordered the mixed salad in extra virgin oil for appetiser, tagliatelle with wild mushroom and minced beef for me, braised rabbit for the guy, tiramisu and expresso for dessert. Of course we ordered a bottle of wine too to complete the meal. Surprisingly the tagliatelle was really good, the portion was quite big for me though. The rabbit was nice too but I can't really enjoy it as that was the first time for me eating rabbit.It was a pleasant dinner. We received a complimentary shot drink from the owners and I will definitely come back to this place again. The service was great and people are very friendly. It happened also that our seating was secluded from the crowded people, which was great because we could have great conversation while listening to the old Italian music that playing while we were eating (the speaker is just above me :p)Keep up the great food and service, Da Luca! :)

This could well be the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. This was our second visit and gave us a chance to confirm our initial suspicion that Da Luca is indeed a hidden gem.First of all, this is a restaurant that knows its stuff. From its mainly Tuscan menu (it takes a quiet confidence to open your offering with tripe alla Fiorentina) to its unashamedly chauvinist wine list (but then, why indeed would you want to look at any other country's reds when you have Italy's to choose from?) and onto the remarkably poised young lady who presides over the front of house, this is a restaurant that knows exactly what it is - namely, a master of complete Italian dining excellence.My companion and I shared, in turn, a capellini with scallop sashimi and truffles; a burrata with spinach and cherry tomatoes; an ossobuco; and a succession of dolci. For wines, we started with a light, frivolous Prosecco, with which we stayed through the pasta, and then switched to an big, intense Amarone to accompany the ossobuco. The burrata and the ossobuco were both excellent. The ossobuco had been braised to perfection and - unlike others I have tried in Singapore - Luca had gone easy on the salt to produce a sauce that was subtle while remaining assertive. The burrata was top-notch - firm, very fresh and moist. But the star, we agreed, was the chilled angel hair pasta with raw scallops and truffles. This turned out to be an inspired combination and was quite simply exquisite (and raised troubling moral questions about how much you could enjoy a dish before it becomes unanswerably sinful). I have had something similar at Gunther's, and perhaps it is not coincidental that Luca is a Purvis Street alumnus - but Luca's is better. Da Luca's secret is that it combines this virtuoso culinary performance with outstanding service and ambience. The restaurant is small enough that the young lady can attend personally to all diners - she was the perfect foil to Luca's skills in the kitchen, discussing any feature of the menu or wine list with real understanding as well as a nicely understated erudition. It made a real difference to our overall experience - she seemed to have an intimate understanding of what each of us was looking for, and indeed by the time we reached the desserts (which incidentally were all light, fresh and scrumptious) we simply gave up and let her decide what we really wanted. She added numerous personal touches, and we were not disappointed.In terms of ambience, Da Luca manages to combine the informality of a trattoria with the elegance and fine cuisine (but not the self-importance) of a ristorante. It is authentic to a fault, and it reminds me of places I have eaten in the hills around Siena where you really do feel you are a welcome guest in somebody's home. It is odd to think of Novena as Singapore's spiritual equivalent of rolling Tuscan hills but, at this cosy and friendly restaurant, it is easy to suspend disbelief.It is not cheap, but it is extraordinarily good value for the experience. Would we go again? Yes, again and again

This is a hidden gem in Singapore but well worth seeking out.I went at lunchtime when it was busy enough but I was not surprised to learn it is packed at night.The eponymous Luca is a serious chef who trained at two of Singapore's best restaurant.We left the choice to him and it really paid off.The highest quality burrata,the porcini risotto and melting tenderloin were a few highlights but the sensational apple tart-ultra thin and crispy- with proper gelato was heaven on a plate.Luca's charming wife is not only amazingly efficient but manages to be perfectly attentive to all the customers.This place deserves its success and I suspevt,before too long,will move to a more central location.One of the real discoveries n Singapore

It is always great when you have a really good Italian around the corner from where you live. Da Luca is just that a really good Italian in the true sense no Pizza. The menu has all you need with some delightful tastes in every department. The wine list is superb both from low to high end and you will find something to accompany your food. The service is exceptional if you are there for a short or a long time. Definitely a good stop on the way home

My husband and I went yesterday for dinner.. Very poor atmosphere, poor sevice and terribly cold. Had to ask twice to turn off the AC.I tried as a starter one of the specials of the day: spanish octopus. Taste was mediocre, octopus definetly not soft. Sauce was anonymous. ( discovered later in the bill that it costed 40 sgd!!!!) My husband tried the carpaccio. Meat was good but not excellent. Main courses: lamb and galletto. Meat was tender and tasty well cooked. Can do the same at home anyway no need to go to a restaurant...2 glasses of brunello, 1 sparkling water. Paid for the dinner 240 SGD .... Definetly too much for an italian avarage dinner. Will for sure not go back a second time
5
I came to know this restaurant a few months ago. Ever since then, I'll dine here often. Love their pasta & ravioli. All freshly made. You may ask for recommendations or ask anything off the menu. It's not a fancy looking restaurant but a cozy place to have meals.
5
I was here with friends who are a regular customer to this restaurant. I was amazed by how small this restaurant is but with efficient service. They serve very good food with reasonable price. A must try if you are around the area.
5
Simple, homely decor doesn't prepare you for food that puts most fine dining establishments to shame. Please try the octopus carpaccio, cold capellini pasta with scallops and truffle oil. One of the pastas that has left a deep impression. Very good wine selection as well
5
There is never a bad dining experience with Da Luca. All dishes we had today was fantastic, especially the cold pasta Angel's hair with Truffles and Scallops, and yummy fresh bread that is free flow. Love this place so so much! And if you have a budget, they set lunches are a value for money. Always enjoyable, always good service

Atmosphere in the restaurant is splendid and the staff is nice, attentive and service minded. But on the other hand the food is just mediocre. My wife had Linguine with prawns, squid and black ink salsa which she said was just okay but was I bit disappointed that there was just three prawns. I had Grilled fresh chicken marinated with fresh Italian herbs and roasted potatoes. The fresh chicken meant that there were a lot of small bones and tendons and not enough to eat. The premium house wine Brunello di Montalcino 2010 was quite ok although quite pricey (130 SGD). The chocolate fondant as a dessert was excellent.
4
It was time for another review for Da Luca.Great place for business lunch, day's 3 courses menu for just Sgd 20+ is a must try, although dessert could be a bit improved.Good service, food and atmosphere as usual, ideal for a relaxed business meeting.Cheer

Good ambience with authentic Italian food. Calamari was nice and not too chewy, pasta sauce was nice, but could be better if less salty which I recon that it could be due to the ham. Risotto was ok and also alittle salty as well. The staffs are experience and are ready to provide you their recommendation on food and wine to go with as well. Will return again but will ask for less salt perhaps. Would have rated it higher if not due to the salt... will review again after my next visit

I am Italian heritage and am very very picky about flavor, tomato sauce, olive oils, bread, etc. I had carpaccio which had thin but very long pieces which made it difficult to share with our friends. The bread was mealy and cake- like, not warm, not crusty, no flavor. The olive oil was too mild.My pasta was cooked perfectly; I enjoyed the crab penne. Our friends really enjoyed their sea bass. The tiramisu was fine. The wine list is quite good. The service was exceptional but the food was only OK, but again, I am very picky and prefer intense flavors.

Recently visit the restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday on a weekday evening. Called 1 day in advance to make the reservation. I indicated that it was to celebrate my husband's birthday. When we arrived at the restaurant, the restaurant is packed. The restaurant had reserved a table for us at the corner. The waiter was very warm, introduced himself and asked for my husband's name. We ordered the cold angel hair pasta and fresh scallops with truffle oil and seaweed. This was not on the menu, but was recommended by the waiter. It was very flavourful and the pasta was cooked al denta. We also ordered salmon pizza, but it was abit of disappointment after the yummy pasta. We ordered Molten Lava cake for dinner. When the dessert came, the waiter also served a complimentary tiramisu with candle and a handwritten birthday message to my husband with his name on the plate. It was a pleasant surprise to my husband as he did not expected it at all. Overall, the meal was very pleasant and the waiters offer great service and constantly check in with us on the food. Will go back for its weekday lunch set at $20++ for a 3-course meal. I will also go back for the cold angel hair and try the other pasta dishes that look really delicious

Its always a little treat for myself to go to Da Luca. My personal favourite - Angel's Hair with Truffles and Scallop, one portion at S$50, means it can't be a daily affair, but only reserved for special occasion! Fresh bread oh so yummy! Service oh so friendly! Sometimes the newer staff could be ditzy but the older ones can always make you really comfortable and welcoming :)Really love this place and if you have a the budget, try their cod fish with mash potatoes very good too! To cut this review short, I have NEVER tried anything in Da Luca that is not delicious
4
You have to make an effort to have the cold angel hair pasta with truffles and clams at Da Luca. So rich, smooth, simple and wholesome. The clams lend sweetness overall and we could not help but savour each bite slowly. Call ahead and check with the chef if they are serving it that night. We mopped up every morsels of the truffle bits with home made bread and brought justice to a priceless seasonal ingredient.
5
I had friends from Italy and we dine at Da Luca. We enjoy the Burrata and the Trippa.
Good wine section and friendly staff.
Bravi and keep it up

I practically had the best burrata here.... very fresh. Bench-marked my standard for burrata and i'm not even a fan of burrata to start with. very nice lambchops as well. Desserts were so-so though....

I wanted to introduce my children to authentic Italian food, and discover cuisines that are beyond your standard pasta and pizza. And what a wonderful journey they had. Da Luca serves the best pastas, all hand made, pizzas and great appetisers/mains. Had a memorable mushroom risotto and squid ink pasta. Deserts were fantastic with a milky smooth panacotta and rich tiramisu. Service was prompt and cheerful and we were well taken care off. I highly recommend this place for good soulful Italian food at reasonable prices. It is also conveniently located near Novena mrt which makes it easy for anyone to access good food without having to drive
5
We had dinner at Da Luca twice over the last few weeks and we loved the food (imagine Carpaccio di Manzo, Burrata, spinach Gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce and awesome pizzas paired with a glass of Prosecco followed by some red wine and the superb final: Tirami-Su and Panna Cotta!!!) and the staff is so lovely and attentive! We'll be back for sure, such a bliss to have Da Luca in our neighbourhood
5
We were recommended this restaurant by a friend for good original italian food. We were not disappointed.We love the pasta and lasagne in nice quaint atmosphere. The wife who loves her wine really likes the large wine selection.Costs are pretty high, even for singapore standards, especially if you work in the wine/beer. But food is so good our family tries to find our way there about once every couple of months

If you are working in novena area and need a good quiet place for business lunch, look no further than Da Luca. You can also help your company save ok entertainment expenses cos the set lunch there is truly inexpensive. On the a la carte menu, Da Luca's mushroom risotto is tops!!! Even the regular restaurants in Rome can't beat this (but then you might say risotto is not a Rome thing). Whatever it is, Da Luca's risotto is incredibly good.I also like the squid ink pasta at Da Luca. Few can do this well, and I daresay the one at Da Luca is the best I have had in Spore.

The waiter claimed the restaurant was out of fresh clams so they couldn't offer the usual clam vongole. Instead he proposed mixed seafood which still had a couple of clams. It was like a school experiment gone wrong - real bad. It was tasteless without anywhere close to what a vongole should be. Don't listen to what the waiters tell you. There is no communication back to the kitchen even when we had told them the vongole sucks, 3 times
3
I think my problem is that I went to Da Luca with an Italian friend who is very "snobby" when it comes to Italian food. The food at Da Luca is acceptable Italian fare. The pasta is good, the meat plates look good (I had the pasta) and the bruschetta was fresh and light. I think the best part of the meal, though, was the cheese plate we ordered for an appetizer. Even my snobby Italian friend had to comment on the quality of the cheese and the creaminess off the burrata. It's a good restaurant, nice for a night out, but not worth the price if you're looking for really excellent Italian food. There are better places in Singapore, however, Da Luca is much more accessible than most.The waiters were very attentive, even when the place filled up and they were responsible for too many tables. Our waiter even spoke Italian with my friend
5
The burata cheese with spinach and tomatoes is to die for, we had the whole blob of burata cheese which is very nice. The truffle ravioli got generous amount of truffles on it, and it is fantastic. T bone steak was medium well and it taste heavenly with the mustard. The beef tripe is also very very nice and risotto I believe is one of the best in Singapore
5
It was my 5th visit to this authentic Italian restaurant and I find it consistently good. We were recommended the perfectly grilled pork belly that was really good - soft and tender. The freshly baked pizza prosciutto and seafood were really good too - unlike other restaurants serving burnt pizza. I like the squid ink penne and the Lasagne- tasty and full of flavor. The service was good and prices were quite reasonable. Will definitely be back when I have craving for a good Italian meal
4
The risotto is good, one of the best in Singapore.
Food's good, authentic. Reasonably priced.
Nice touch when we were served limoncello at the end of our meal.
Tis the place to satisfy cravings for good Italian food. :)
5
Brilliant food. Authentic Italian. The set menus are superb. Would go there agin. The dessert was also great. A must try. And very accessible from Novena MRT.
4
The truffle ravioli are not on the menu, ask for it. In season they are a real highlight, and you would cross half the island to taste this dish. Quiet atmosphere, alfresco terrace, great wine. ..one of my favourite Italians in Singapore.
5
Having a couple of friends in town; we headed to De Luca again. This place definitely has found its clientele as it was full on a week day; and justifiably so. The black mussels as a starter were sublime and are highly recommended. As usual I asked for my ravioli special with truffles, black this time, and the magic worked again. Simple and extremely good. To have an italian chef in the cuisine just makes a difference and combined with the manageable size of the place; it is still on top of my list. Just to add that it is safer to book these days if you want to get a table at that lovely place. Buon apetit
4
Delicious spinach soup, piping hot and just perfect. Never had spinach soup and it was delicious. Tagliatelle was also very tasty and a good sized portion. Good priced Italian treat for lunch. I loved that spinach soup. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much bother. The selection of bread that was served with the olive oil was beautifully fresh and crispy too. Definitely worth a visit if you are in that part of the city

My wife and I, visited Da Luca during the truffle season and decided to order their dish of the day which was Truffle Tagliatelle. The dish was excellent, fragrant and creamy and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Its so good that I actually dreamed about the dish at night and decided to go the same restaurant again the next day. Waiters were friendly and professional. Smiling and engaging. Explanation about the menu was excellent, choosing food and wine was a breeze with their help. With the quality dish and superb staff this restaurant's up there among the best. However, atmosphere/decor was a bit outdated, a little renovation would make this place even greater. I would certainly come back to this restaurant bringing friends and family
1
The first time my wife and I went to Da Luca we had a good experience, the waiter Jack from Malaysia was fantastic. So I decided to take my Mother. who was visiting from overseas there. After being seated by a less than friendly German (I think) Lady. We were offered still or sparkling water. Later on I saw a waitress pouring water to other tables from a cantina jug, I wondered why we had a bottle so checked the menu to find the bottled water was $7. Obviously the water from the cantina was free, however we were not given the option for still (tap water) and basically were only given the choice of 2 different bottled water which is basically a sales rip off, we hardly drank the water as we were drinking alcohol so I found it to be a Con in disguise, most restaurants give you table water at no charge and if you want distilled bottle water you ask for it. The next disturbing thing was the Asian waitress who was assigned to our table, who just dumped food on our table when it arrived. I had to call her back to get pepper for a risotto and parmesean cheese for the pizza as there were no seasonings on the table ie pepper or salt, which she did with a scowl. After our first drink we had to wave the waitress down to order another, with her opening line was, YES? in a condescending tone. The table next to ours was asked how there food was (different waitress), though we were never asked (I don't usually mind not getting asked however when the table next to you is and you are not it makes you feel very under valued), in saying this though, the table next to us had ordered pasta with truffle on it, when they were told this they decided to cancel there order (fair enough) however the waitress then came back and said they cannot cancel?? the couple next to us then said they didn't want the dish as it was not what was stated in the menu, the waitress went away and came back and said that they do now have truffle?? very strange. I believe they had a function on later as there were many reserved seats and they were saving it for the reserved people... very unproffesional. I have been to many restaurants around the world and I can honestly say it was the most unfriendly atmosphere and staff I have ever encountered. I am far from a difficult customer a smile and normal greetings is fine, basic service etc, but the negativity I found from particularly the Caucasian woman and the Asian girl assigned to our table was off the chart. They put an automatic 7% service charge on there bill which when you don't get any thing near decent service is, however noting that the service was that shocking its understandable, as who would tip..

We first time patronized this restaurant and during restaurant week. We have our lunch but I decided to try out their dinner set after seeing its Menue. No regret, I really love it's foie gras, very smooth came with great source. So tasty that I told the wait staff to let the chef know it was real good. It's mushroom soup with truffle oil was generous in both it's size and amount of mushroom. The fresh crabmeat pasta with light tomato source was good too. My family enjoy the food here. Would definitely be back, especially it's foie gras. It was gathered that it's chef previously working for Garibaldi before having his own outlet

You would never thing that you could find such a wonderful little Italian eatery in the rundown Goldhill plaza. I was brought here by two friends, who swore me to secrecy... but it is too good not too share! Make sure that you order the Burrata cheese, it is the most fresh and delicious Burrata cheese I have ever had in Singapore, better than the one I tasted at Mozza in MBS! The Tomato served with it is very sweet and ripe, while the creamed spinach is delicious. There was also a cold truffle pasta served with scallop, which I think was a special for the day. If they are still serving it now, make sure to order it! The portion is good enough for 4 people to share as a appetizer. Absolutely delicious. Other than that, I ordered the ravioli in a cream sauce with a sausage filling which was a surprisingly large portion. I was stuffed! My friends ordered the risotto as well as the clam pasta, both of which were also very authentic and generous portions. I ended off the meal with a tiramisu to share, which was quite small, honestly, I could have eaten the whole thing myself. It was also very creamy with a great coffee flavour. Overall, we had such a fantastic time, and the meal, including some glasses of wine only cost us around 80 dollars a head. Such a great deal for a nice Italian meal! Definitely a place to try
4
Burrata with just the right texture and accompaniments started up a great lunch. Squid ink linguine which was generously made in all ways was very hearty.One can slurp around with some of the great bread made on the site and this adds to the satisfaction. The mussels were not the greatest but overall it was an enjoyable well- crafted meal, It was more than the company that made for a sense of real food, While well plated one, didnt have to suffer the large plate, pretty pictures and tiny food syndrome which dominates some more precious dining abodes in the Lion City
