This place is always on my list when visiting Singapore, it’s expensive but the quality of the food and ingredients make it worthwhile , including fabulous Wagyu beef and scallops .
4
The 8 course brunch was execellent. Each course was delicious, and elegantly presented. The price was also reasonable.
5
We come here for celebrate x’mas. Food in here is fresh. The service nice as well especially Amanda. She is friendly and helpful. If you want have great dining experience, here is the best place.
4
Good quality food and nice ambience. Suitable for business lunch with clients. I will definitely come back again.
4
Overall the food is great but I felt the soba can improve further. Tempura were served Super hot! Sashimi were very fresh too. Will return.
4
Make a reservation and mention your dietary preferences. I went for their vegetarian set course. Most of the dishes were either a hit or at least above average. Only a couple were a miss. Getting a table in front of the counter is much recommended.The place wasn't packed and this is good
4
Be prepared to pay a lot to dine here. I only come here when I want to indulge myself. But the food is consistently good and service impeccable. It is certainly a worthwhile experience. Thr only flaw this time was the desert. The honey melon was overly chilled to the point of betting soggy. Of course this was promptly replaced with a fresh serving when I pointed out to the service staff.

Had a Friday lunch for Keyaki for 4, which allowed us to try a variety of dishes. Key highlights were tuna salad, wagyu beef with fried garlic, spider sushi, and a tea soup (can’t recall the name, but it’s a lovely broth made overnight of chicken, prawn and lemongrass and then served as a tea).

The food was terrible and extremely unbecoming of a fine dining Japanese restaurant.Of all the mediocre dishes, the cha soba stood out (for the wrong reasons). My mum thought it tasted like airplane food and she’s usually very kind with her words.Service was lackluster as well and despite us giving them feedback about the food, they didn’t really bother or even passed on that feedback to their chef.It was my dad’s birthday and we requested for a cake for my dad which they forgot.The decor of the restaurant was very nice but if you are looking to splash out $200 per person for a meal, there are many other places to go

If one could give a negative rating I will give it for today's experience. Was here to celebrate my mother-in law's birthday. Haven't been here for a while. Was actually looking forward to it. But what a letdown!It was a large group and we each ordered differently. However no one kept track of who ordered what item. Courses were sent to the table without identifying who ordered the dishes. Worse of all, two of us ordered the premium signature seasonal Kaiseki and the courses were served haphazardly. The courses were very far separated apart. When queried the manager brought the rice dish. We realized something was wrong. We found out that the grilled beef and simmered dish had not been served. For a premier restaurant charging such prices I find this unacceptable. They have lost a customer forever.

Perfect visit. Amazing meal. Good business lunch.One of the server Kim she is very good. we will visit again
4
They have interesting menu with a range of prices to suit your budget especially the set menu. Good service too.
3
Food was expensive. Food was ok. Service time was a bit slow with only 2 tepanyaki chefs manning their station. But Ambience was superb with the nice Japanese garden.
3
The wait for food is simply too Long, we waited more than an hour despite the restaurant being quite empty.
3
Superb service staff and nice, peaceful ambience. The food is good, but could be much better given the price range. Ingredients are not top notch.
4
We came as a group of 4 for teppanyaki. The food was really good but very expensive for the quantities we received. The service by our waitress was 'average' and the chef was nice but didn't put on a real 'show' like we have experienced at other teppanyaki restaurants.
4
Comparatively the prices on the menu are near the roof. The sashimi chef prepares fresh salmons and tuna. The selection of Japanese dishes are impressive and quite skilful cooking. The well maintain Japanese garden with the beautiful collection of the Japanese koi fish. Service personnel are so so but there are room for improvement.
5
Keyaki has always been my favourite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Can be relied upon to always serve the freshest seafood, top quality wagyu beef, cruchy salad and tasty soups. Although the whole meal was not cheap (S$600 for 2 pax) with a bottle of sake, it was worth every dollar...will keep coming back
5
We had a seat at the chefs table and followed his advise what to choose and in which sequence. Everything we had was very tasteful and the chef really understood to guide us. We enjoyed the sparkling sake, that was new to us. The staff very nice and friendly. It's not a cheap place to eat, but it's very good - and in my opinion worth the money
4
I had dinner with friend in this restaurant. We ordered two Ran sushi sets and the beef tongue. The sushi was fresh and good. The beef tongue was also good but can be better if grilled a bit longer. The environment is very comfortable and the service is good. Overall, it is a bit expensive properly because it is inside a hotel
2
We have dinners with colleagues from US. The expense is pretty high while the Japanese foods there were not authentic ...
4
Good japaneese food in an elegant ambiance at the Pan Pacific Hotel.
All starters and main courses were very good. The service was efficient and friendly.
5
We had a delightful meal which was made even more pleasurable by Steve and Andrew. The dishes were one of the best Japanese food we have ever eaten. We decided we would prefer a la carte as we dined for our wedding anniversary and wished to just enjoy each others company without anyone else. Great night, wonderful food, thank you Andre
4
Most restaurants these days are crowded and noisy. This however provides a lovely zen surrounding in which to enjoy your meal. The walk to the restaurant starts off the lovely experience- one has to walk outdoors throw a Japanese stone pathway and pass a koi pond.Service is inconsistent - we had a mix of lovely and attentive staff and the " just doing their job" crew.Food is delicious We had the Sunday set lunch menu on both occasions and we walked out feeling replete but not over stuffed.Lovely presentation together with the quality of food make the slightly steeper than normal prices worth it . We went with my baby and the one draw back is the lack of baby changing facilities . The manager was however quick on his feet and flexible enough to offer us the use of one of the available dining rooms
5
It was my daughter's 15th and coming back to Keyaki for the occasion reminded us how quickly ten years have zipped by since we first brought her here. Although she is no longer in awe of "beef on fire", it remains whimsical nonetheless. The secret to food this good starts with the fresh selection of choice ingredients then cooked to perfection by a chef who understands the art of teppanyaki. We made a request for chef Chua to cook for us because my daughter remembers him all these years. When you turn up and see a familiar face, it tells you the restaurant team makes an effort to oblige. The food and service quality remains top notch. Keyaki is clearly at the top of Singapore's teppanyaki league table.
5
Best Japanese restaurant ever tried . Location , staff , food....everything is wonderful and excellent. We tried tempura, noodles, nigiri, sashimi , maki roll..... everything has been perfect . Let me underline even staff professionalism and efficiency .Even if not cheap , price is largely justified

This was a last minute reservation made via an online website to celebrate my husband's birthday and Father's Day in advance. An employee made the effort to call on the requested day to confirm the reservation for my husband, son and I for dinner.Being known more for teppanyaki, we were pleasantly surprised by the salmon and scallop sashimi which was presented as though the dish is a piece of art. The sashimi was fresh and each piece delighted my husband's palette. The california maki comprised 6 pieces of sushi. This is one of the rare times where the salmon roe coating the Japanese rice felt turgid yet juicy, notwithstanding it being tiny.The beef fillet and beef tongue teppanyaki were probably cooked almost well done yet very tender. Another teppanyaki dish we tried was scallop wrapped in beef slices, which combined the succulent tastes of both that we felt was unique. The cod fish with teriyaki sauce was perfect; not too oily and the sauce not overwhelmingly salty. We also sampled the garlic rice that was fragrant. The tempura set with cold soba looked quite ordinary, yet the batter was crisp and the soba chewy.Dessert was simple with lime sorbet and red bean soup with mochi. The sorbet was refreshing and taste homemade. The latter was interesting with its clear soup base and flat, round mochi. They were a fitting end to a wonderful meal.The restaurant is located within a Japanese garden at the hotel. Attention has been given for guests to feel like they have been transported to Japan, such as numerous koi in large ponds, architecture and Zen surroundings. We wish to dine there again, particularly for special occasions.

I am rarely happy at a Japanese restaurant whose itamae (and everybody else working there) is not Japanese. Well, I can tell you Keyaki is the exception, in that the quality of the service is excellent, the sushi the closest thing to Tokyo, Kobe you can get outside of Japan. (A small caveat: the edamame was less than perfect). Highly recommended, an address worth remembering
3
Was at Keyaki for a business lunch and was very impressed with the decor of the restaurant. You have walk thru a small zen Japanese garden on the 4th floor of the Pan Pacific Hotel to reach the restaurant. When the automated door slides open there are two very welcoming waitresses to greet you in Japanese. The warm and dimly lit atmosphere brings up the anticipation of good food even more. The menu is very well stocked with the various types of Japanese cuisine, teppanyaki, tempura, sashimi, sushi, bento sets and deserts. However, the quality of food for that price disappoints a little. Overall the restaurant is a good place for business talk but if you are into Japanese food, there are tons more options for this price range.

Visited Keyaki for a special occasion with someone special last week.When we arrived at the entrance, door sign still showing "in-preparation" at 11:35am. While we were waiting at restaurant lobby, we saw some patrons were already at the teppanyaki counter, but no staff was around to entertain us.After several minutes, we managed to attract someone's attention to get us seated. There were no tea or drinking water served until we requested for it. This is a bad manners for a Japanese restaurant by any standard. We ordered sake but it seems like its bottle cap was not closed last night. The quality of the food was not on par with the status of the Keyaki. The lobster served was tough to chew and the beef is "Oh No", the wagyu could be better.Overall experience is a big disappointment for the special occasion on that day. Not up to the minimal expectation of this high end restaurant. Maybe bad luck of me :
5
The food and service is good ! Compare with the price it is really value added. They may increase the selection of wine, such as Rose.
5
Super good Japanese teppanyaki or just plain high quality Japanese food. Loved their mushroom soup and grilled. Cold tofu was good. Beef with goose liver was fantastic. Please try sushi.
4
As always, Keyaki serves great food with compatible service. Ingredients were fresh, tasty with variety.
5
The food taste so good that I felt that I am eating in Japan. 😊 The ambience is nice and the service staff are friendly.
4
Brought my wife and my daughter for dinner. Service staff were attentive and food was good. My daughter loved the food that was served.
5
I went for the spring lunch menu on my last day in Singapore. The lunch was completely delicious, very beatuifully presented and the service was warm and friendly. The place was busy but i was never neglected. I highly recommend you treat yourself to a lunch at Keyaki
5
We ordered the Weekend Brunch menu, where we can choose each dishes from amuse bouche to teppanyaki to dessert. Generally, the dishes are well sized and are flavorful. Waiter also gave good recommendations when we were pondering on what dish to order. I would visit Keyaki again. Nice atmosphere and environment for a upscale Japanese Restaurant
5
Was invited at the behest of a good fried to enjoy a Teppanyaki meal at Keyaki. Was not disappointed as the food was excellently prepared with all the usual flame and knife theatrics. We ordered the lobster and wagyu set which was very tasty. A special mention must be given to the the lobster dish as it tasted as if it was just caught. Service was quick and attentive. All in all a very enjoyable evening
5
Dined at this restaurant annually for the past 10 yrs. Food and service was good.Server was extremely cautious of our order and often I order more than what we can consume.We ordered ala carte and set and by mistake had a beef item that we don't take.Server did an exchange with a smile.Birthday cake was complimentary. UOB Credit card has a promotion of 20% off for ala carta items
5
Entering the Japanese restaurant you will walk through a real Japanese garden and you will be amazed to see a koi pond with waterfall. The koi numbering about 70 beautiful big ones some measures more than a foot. We ordered sashimi, Wagyu beef teppanyaki, sanma grilled fish, gindara terriyaki, tempura, chicken balls yakitori, Japanese fried rice, tofu with mushrooms. Having kirin beers and warm sake. Overall it was a perfect Japanese dinner. Taste is authentic Japanese since I know for I stayed in Tokyo for 4 years. Service is excellent as well
5
Went there for my husband's birthday celebration. Nice ambience, awesome food and great service! Will definitely go back again
4
Came here for my husband's birthday dinner date! Tranquil environment for dining. Premium quality dining at pretty affordable prices. Furthermore, there is a 20% discount for uob card. Their beef is good!!!
5
Came here for my last night for a nice high end dining experience. I did the Spring fixed menu and it was worth every cent! Beautiful display for the food courses and great recommendations by the staff for seating as well as saki choice.
4
The staff are all friendly and attentive. We had the weekend 8-course brunch menu. Food was served promptly and they were all delicious.
5
Everything about this place is fantastic. The food is of very high class. We went for a menu that included both vegetables, meat and seafood. A absolutely memorable experience.
4
Best introduction to Japanese food ever. Appropriate menu guidance, food history and alternates if required.
5
My family and I had gone to Keyaki for lunch last week. The beef was very tender and we had a wonderful lunch!
5
Choosing 8 course from 40 dishes is what we call a first world problem - and it was so hard to choose!! Each course provides 5 options and you can't go wrong. The teppanyaki cod, salmon sashimi, and Japanese sweets were the best courses. Must try the sparkling sake from Kyoto!! The champagne is high quality and your glass is endlessly topped up by the attentive and pleasant wait staff. I will be back!
5
Restaurant was located on 4th level of Panpac Hotel Singapore. Very Japanese feel as the hallway towards restaurant was replica of a mini Japanese garden with koi pond. Loved the design.Had the popular teppanyaki with foie gras, beef fillet, iberico pork, salmon, and cod fish. All tasted delicious and what a show displayed by the Chef. Servers were all friendly and polite. Kudos to the excellent service rendered throughout meal. Lastly, we were also treated to a big slice of yummy chocolate birthday cake which was complimentary.
4
went for a birthday celebration for 8 people, the chef was skillful and the food delicious, beef was very tender. service was decent, but could have been better - on top of the sake we ordered, we asked for ice water from the start of the meal which only came near the end of the teppanyaki experience despite repeated reminders (roughly 10+ times); we had brought our own birthday cake, but had heard there would be a complimentary cake as well, which was charged into the bill at the end haha, would have been nice if it were clarified at the start/end. all in all a great dining experience, but with the money paid, service could have been better
5
We had an incredible evening. The food and atmosphere was wonderful but our chef Alvin made the evening special. He is super friendly and talented at his job. I strongly recommend this restaurant and remember to ask for Alvin.
2
Starting with the gas station chop sticks and continuing through the substandard sashimi this place grossly under performs its rating. Dont bother unless you want to waste S$400-500 on a Sushi Tei meal.
5
Celebrate my wife's birthday here. We order Hana set and wagyu beef set. Both sets are excellent and yummy. The wagyu beef are tender and so juicy.
An excellent restaurant for special occasion!
4
One of the better mid range priced Japanese restaurant in Singapore.
Ambience and services are good.
Food are good, but still cannot compare to Japan.
5
This is probably one of the best tappanyaki restaurants in town trendy place very good quality food and the beef tongue is a must try
I have been coming here for many years and can only recommend it
5
Even though it weren't authentic Japanese Omakase, they still delivered excellent dinner course with high ingredients quality and taste. The prices also reasonably set.
4
Nice as always. Been here a few times but be prepared to pay for it. We spent $400 for 2 of us. Good sashimi.
5
The staff was good and the food was fresh. Ordered the Fuku set which has the chef surprising us through all the courses. The quality was top notch! I have been to Keyaki more than two decades ago and they have certainly maintained their standards. Definitely recommended
4
Keyaki doesn't have the best or most authentic japanese cuisine in town, but it does tick the boxes in most areas, making it a preferred choice for many, if you have the bucks to spend. On average, be prepared to spend approx $150+ and above per pax especially if you order the set menus and sashimi. Ask for the seasonal items that are not on the menu. These tend to be more interesting than what's available on the menu
4
The food is overall good quality but if you are a first timer at Japanese food or not used to the traditional stuff, know what to order.This restaurant is more authentic and traditional than most so don't expect an amendment for western taste.The teppanyaki is their best food, the maki sushi is good for those who like quality fish but they are fairly plain; I prefer the fancier kind that come with sauces and other toppings.Their noodles are great too but I recommend you order some meat to go with it.Price is acceptable for what you get in Singapore.Would not come back to this restaurant but would recommend to those who like traditional Japanese food.
4
Sitting in a nice semi-outdoor location of Pan Pacific, with beautiful garden beside the entrance. Very authentic Japanese lunch meals at a relatively reasonable price.
5
Food & service was excellent. It is a great place to spend birthday celebrations / special occasions :)
3
Teppanyaki is both fun and usually tasty. This restaurant does not compare to Japan and other similar restaurants in Singapore. Wagyu was not the best quality and the cooking uninspired.
5
Keyaki never fails to delight in its consistently fine cuisine, elegant and simple decor. Seasonal offerings from around Japan brings us to Ishikawa this time.
5
The food is delicious and fresh, though it takes quite a while to serve.
Service is excellent. The staff even arrange for a small slice of cake for my friend after knowing that we are celebrating her birthday.
3
We loved our tempura items. We found the teppanyaki for which this restaurant is known, mediocre. We enjoy the spacious atmosphere of the main dining room. Had we not had a 20% discount via Chope, we would have found it expensive.
4
I've never been disappointed with my meals at Keyaki. Excellent food, pleasant ambience and attentive service.
4
Just had a delicious dinner at Keyaki Japanese Restaurant. We ordered the special Ishikawa Prefecture set with the focus on Noto (Wagyu) beef. The dishes did not disappoint, especially the different servings of beef - from thin slices of raw beef to tenderloin cubes on hot stones. The set menu is for a limited season at the restaurant and my hubby and I were glad we chose Keyaki to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Service was quiet and unobtrusive. The general manager came to promote the menu and the sake options. There was a bit of a communication barrier as he was more fluent in Japanese but we could tell he was enthusiastic to promote the quality of the food. We had a nice surprise when the senior staff gave us a lovely piece of chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary. I wondered though, if that was because I had mentioned it aloud or that the management had taken note of what I had written in my on-line booking. Another little peeve was they gave us a small table while other couples were given a larger one (4-seater) even though the restaurant was not crowded and we had arrived very early at 6.30pm, before the others. We were also right next to the service table which wasn't one of the best places to enjoy a quiet dinner. Nevertheless, the food was good and well worth the price we paid, considering we had 4 servings of Wagyu beef in 4 different ways.
5
boyfriend took me here for my birthday lunch and we both had the weekend brunch set. it was a 7-course meal that comprised a bit of everything - which is perfect when you want to have a variety of food at one sitting. quality of food was great, well worth the high price tag. casual ambience that makes you feel like youre in a japanese home (i definitely overdressed). my fav dish was the scallop with mentaiko and the tempura was amaaaaazing.
3
Reservation was in order and I enquired about the 20% Chope discount which they confirmed was correct. Service and quality of food were good. Just not too happy during the billing. They did not deduct the 20% discount and when I asked about it, the waitress was pretty rude, just looked at me took the bill and went off, an apology would have been nice. I did ask about the 20% discount before I was seated and they confirmed it will be automatically included in the bill. The bill was then reissued with the discount
5
Keyaki always delivers what they promise to deliver. A few recommendations are their prix fix lunch, unajyu and bento.
5
Great Service, value for money and definitely will be returning soon.
Good location as well. Well done
4
Brunch set was worth it. Found the a la carte menu rather pricy. Very nice ambiance. Food is ok, nothing spectacular
5
The fish was so fresh, overrall delicious, well presented japanese cuisine. Great enviroment and good service.
4
Have been there for a farewell dinner with Friend! Nice Japanese restaurant and food, especially sashimi and Wagyu beef. Excellent service!!!
5
One of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore. My husband brought me there for my birthday meal, and he made a very good decision to sit at the Teppanyaki station. It's always nice watching your food being cooked! We had the teppanyaki set meal - foie gras and wagyu beef were outstanding. Sashimi was fresh, as expected.Attentive & really friendly servers. One of the service staff, Nick, is Korean, and he was most kind in sharing with us about Korea when we expressed interest in visiting Korea. He even went the extra mile and passed us the latest copy of the Korea Travel Guide
5
If you want great Japanese food. Go here. The restaurant though part of a hotel has been able to create a very soothing atmosphere for you. The food is wonderful. The ingredients ( from Iga?) was very special and the service ( Nick?) was very attentive without being intrusive. Strongly recommend this place
4
This is one of the rare eating places in the city that offers you a quiet area to have a short stroll and appreciate their well maintained zen garden and koi ponds before adjourning into the main restaurant for your meal. The interior of the restaurant is generally small and cosy, and offers an assortment of set lunches that showcases their teppanyaki specialties.The food is good and we enjoyed the quality of the wagyu beef and ingredients used in their sukiyaki. The delicious beef udon was also a pleasant surprise as well.Prices are on the high side but you do get the japanese quality, experience and service
4
I must say the assistant manager, Andrew & crews made my 1st visit to Keyaki a very good experience. The service was impeccable with superb attentiveness to the details. The food was delicate and well done. My husband and I had a great dinner and we would definitely be back with our family again. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because we were seated by the side doors and every time a staff opens the door to serve the alfresco diners, we would feel a gush of hot air coming in. I don't recommend sitting anyone at that table at all. Otherwise all good! PS. Heads up, UOB card members gets 20% off!
4
Had a great dinner with the teppanyaki sets. The lobster was nicely cooked and you can taste the innate sweetness. The wagyu beef was perfectly done and the fats were nicely seared. Recommend this restaurant for its service and food with the added bonus of a beautiful japanese garden settin
3
We ordered two of the sushi platters and were not particularly impressed considering the price. It certainly wasn't enough food to feed 4. The service was extremely slow and the air con far too cold! Would not recommend.
5
We had a great time at Keyaki last weekend. Sashimi was really fresh! We also enjoyed the service by Nick, who was attentive, polite and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back!
5
I stayed at the Pan Pacific for 3 days and had to have dinner late night. The food was excellent and the service was great. The staff his name was Nick was really attentive and made the dinner pleasant.
4
Very good quality food and ambience. Service staff is friendly (Nick) and prompt in his service. Recommended for family meals or a private event with friends.
4
Have not been here for awhile. Food is good and fresh although a little pricey. Service is good and love the small garden and pathway leading up to the restaurant.
5
Their bubbly & brunch set is recommended with $75++ /pax you can try most of the favorite dish at keyaki. If you would like to have free flow sake, champagne, & house red & white wine just pay $ 135++/pax . Friendly staff and nice ambience very suitable to spend your lunch with family
5
When in Singapore we make a point of visiting this excellent high end Japanese restaurant. No compromise on flavors and yet a healthy food experience! Also we were waited on by Nick who did an outstanding job and a pleasure to have a short chat with
5
Try everything. The menu is varied and absolutely delicious. I had my first beef tongue and was enamored with the tastes. Sashimi, sushi, gyoza, cocktails, and desserts...everything was served beautifully (and in a stunning environment) and was delectable. The service was a bit off, but the food and the atmosphere made up for what they lacked in good service.
5
Visited restaurant with few friends. Restaurant has a private zen garden with koi pond. It was a private event. My friend's wedding lunch.Cosy quiet nice ambience. Clean restaurant. Helpful waiters and waitresses. Right combination of fresh sashimi and cooked food. Small portion of food to make one craving for more. Truly enjoyed.
5
This is a rare gem in Sg that offers quality Jap food! Everyone must try their udon which is made by a master in the restaurant. One slurp of it reminds me of the udon I had in Japan itself! How can this not be rare? We had their grilled skewers, sashimi, udon, whisky n sake for dinner. Nothing was disappointing or just average. Every dish is delicious n fresh. Even baby was enjoying the udon, beef n chawamushi. It's a lovely anniversary dinner n we were glad that there is such a good restaurant within the hotel itself. Guests don't have to worry about having to go out to look for good food! Highly recommended n we will definitely be back!
5
Been at this restaurant many times the food and service never fails to impress!
My compliments to Vincent, Andrew, and Jocelyn for being attentive, courteous and made my friends and I feel like home.
Thank you and we will be back again :)
5
My wife and I visited Keyaki a week ago for a dinner. The food was exquisite; we had fresh lobsters, white fish, fried rice with vegetables and desert. Everything was prepared to the perfection by chef demonstrating art of cooking in front of us. Nick, our server did a fantastic job, explaining the details of the menu and taking care every single request with a highest priority...Special thanks to Nick
4
A well appointed spacious restaurant with two beautiful private dining rooms, one of which overlooks a charming Japanese garden. The service was attentive and prompt. Food though was decent but not superb. We had the chef's Omakase menu and our favourite dish was the bamboo shoots wrapped in Wagyu beef. The Sakura ebi tempura was interesting. The sushi was a disappointment. Overall though, I would still consider this worthy of being in the top 20 of Japanese restaurants in Singapore.
4
This place has a nice Japanese garden but it has a modern interior. I think this is a favourite for a banker business lunch and is very busy when we came. Service was excellent. This place is not cheap but for the lunch set just below SGD60 and one eats till one is very full. I think its better than the Japanese restaurant at Shangri-La. Air-con is a bit cold so remember to bring a jacket/cardigan
5
My hubby and I were at the Keyaki today for a quiet celebration of my birthday after hearing from friends who highly recommended this restaurant that served exquisite Japanese food. We sat at a table looking out to a beautiful, tranquil garden while listening to the water sound from the koi pond. True to their words, we are served by two excellent and attentive staff members, Jessie and Nick. As we don't take beef due to religious reasons, we asked Nick to double check that the bento sets we ordered do not contain beef. Both Nick and Jessie ensured that our drinks were topped-up at all times and were very attentive to our needs. When our meals arrived separately, Jessie would patiently explain the dishes and combination of the food items. After the meal, during one of the small talks we discovered that both of them are from Korea. In fact several of the staff are from Korea too and we find that they are all very polite, courteous and hardworking.I truly enjoyed my birthday experience at this restaurant. GREAT FOOD, GREAT AMBIENCE AND EXCELLENT SERVICE!
5
We were there for my father's birthday dinner. Walking to the restaurant already felt as if you were @ Japan. The staff were friendly and attentive, serving us tea while we were waiting for the rest to arrive. I ask for the menu just to have an idea what to order and the staff patiently introduce to me some of the sets for my considerationThe food and service is great. Ambience is good too. Hungry for more!At the end of the dinner, the chef wrote some well wishes on the hot plate " Happy Birthday 寿比南山“ on the hot plate, using his cooking salt ... Nice 
4
Both lunch and dinner offerings here are incredible and service is amazing as well. The restaurant is located in pan pacific hotel, but the entrance to the restaurant takes you through a small scenic Japanese garden before reaching the main dining rooms; this makes for a very quaint experience.The teppanyaki set lunch meals are also great value and if you have a small group of 6 or more they would usually assign one Chef exclusive for your group.Service is also excellent, last week they offered to change a few choices of fish on my sashimi platter as I found the taste not to my liking. And they came back with even higher value items. Great service recover
5
I took my husband here for his birthday whilst we were on our honeymoon! The restaurant is located in the Pan Pacific Hotel with a wonderful entrance and stylish interior.We sat at the teppanyaki grill and ordered one of the set menus. Our chef was the incredible Eamon Chan who cooked the most delicious food and made our visit to the restaurant the most wonderful experience.You must visit here if you are ever in Singapore and looking to eat at a top class restaurant.Ask for Eamon
4
The first time I have visited Keyaki was around 1999. I was impressed but at that age, it was premium price!Over the years, I still visit for business luncheons and dinners. Value for money for lunch set menus. If you are reading this and planning your 2016 Chinese New Year's Lo-Hei, it is a must try their "Sashimi Lo-Hei" during this period. It's authentically their style. Even better if you are with a big group. I can't reveal more otherwise it will not work out as a surprise. Another occasion for dinner for 4, hmmm, go for lunch instead. Cheaper price and food quality is not compromised. Will I return? Yes!
4
One of our Singapore favourites, and on this occasion only one other couple had booked the lunch teppanyaki so the usual atmosphere was lacking, and our chef did not have much flair, but our food choices of scallops, prawns, salmon,mixed vegetables,garlic fried rice, and miso soup, were very tasty as usual. Our hostess was very engaging and professional. When we received our bill, we were delighted to find their promotion delivered 50% discount, resulting in total cost $58.00 ++ excellent value
4
We had set menu lunch with our friends, the food tasted delicious! The serve is larger than I expected! The restaurant was separated from pan pacific hotel by a Japanese garden, gives u bit of the zen felling!
4
This is a pleasant restaurant with an extensive menu of Japanese food. I suspect that things can get quite expensive if you go for dinner, or the tepanyaki options...but I was pleasantly surprised by the lunch menu and prices. You have to stick to the bento boxes or the set lunches, but the food was very good and prices were around 60 to 80 Sing Dollars. Reasonable value for very good quality authentic Japanese food. Service was OK. Decor is pleasant : a large room , with ample space between tables

Nice place with good service, good area with friends and business lunch.The lunch is good but expensive as usual in singapore on japan food.Value for money is average, but you are sure to not be desapointed, good service, nice food and clean area...what else
5
This is my second time here, and it's still as good as ever. Service is prompt and all the staffs are very attentive to your needs. We tried the konezawa beef, and it was heaven! Sashimi and the rolls are fresh, tasty and well presented. Will definitely come back here again for more! :

We have a tradition of splurging on fine dining whenever we travel abroad, so I've read tons of reviews before choosing Keyaki for our place to be while in Singapore. The result was... questionnable. We chose the priciest tasting menu on the list - the Kaiseki Kiri and while the food was definitely good, it just as definitely had no wow factor to it. And definitely it should not cost what we paid in the end. Now, I believe Singapore is considered to be expensive in terms of fine dining, but we have been to Michelin star/famous chef restaurants in London, Geneva and Abu Dhabi amongst others and comparing to them, Keyaki was just not worth it. Which was a disappointment overall. Having paid over 500 SGD for dinner, now I can hardly remember more than 2 dishes out of all the menu that we had. And no offence to this particular restaurant but in general I find the practice of not including the taxes in the menu prices very deceiving. Even having a discount as hotel guests did not save the whole experience.So to sum it all up - don't expect much apart from a fat bill from here

We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary and this was it. Amazing food and (of course) courteous staff who helped with our selection of food. The dishes were dainty, tasty and melted in the mouth. The garden was lovely to walk through when heading into and out of the restaurant. A very enjoyable evening
4
My friend had recommended Keyaki thus my boyfriend and I had our dinner at Keyaki on 18 July 2015 (Saturday). It is located at Pan Pacific Hotel. Keyaki has a garden and the restaurant is pretty big. It was not crowded at the time we visited. The service was very good, staffs were very attentive. The food was good. I personally enjoy the sashimi and foie gras w beef. The sashimi were very fresh. Would recommend to try :
5
I'm already a vegan but I'm still picky with my vegan food. I do not like processed food or food without adequate nutrition. But that vegan food in Keyaki was just superb! Even my meat-eating friends had nothing but praises for the food that they've ordered
3
Was there on a Friday evening. Not as packed as the Japanese restaurant in Goodwoodpark. Food was good, but not cheap. Sashimi was fresh. Waiter was very knowledgeable in recommending the fresh fish that was in that day.Overall good service. Would go again to pamper myself
5
Keyaki is set inside/outside the amazing Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore, one of several fine dining establishments on the premises. It's not cheap, but it is definitely delicious with excellent service. We had a selection of some of the best sushi I've ever been served, and a stunningly delicious wagyu teppanyaki, matched with a fine, warm sake. But as I said, you pay for what you get, so save this for a special night out
5
Lovely jap restaurant. Really nice house sake. The miso cod was fantastic! We also had the udon tempura and soba tempura. Both were great. The chief had amazing subtle flavors that you expect from Japanese cooking.
5
Keyaki is set in a beautiful Japanese garden, through which you enter the restaurant. There is outdoor and indoor seating with dining at the teppan available. The decor and atmosphere is almost serene, only disturbed (in a good way!) from groups and couples who were clearly enjoying their meal. The menu choices are set up so that you can choose from set menus or a la carte. Hot towels are offered before the meal to refresh.I could not go past the Kiri set menu, which at S$200 was pretty expensive but did include sashimi, grilled lobster and grilled wagyu beef, all of which I love and are hardly cheap ingredients. The set consisted of an amuse bouche, appetiser, clear soup, sashimi, grilled lobster, tofu salad, grilled wagyu beef, rice or noodles and dessert. Wait staff explained all dishes as they were presented and the pace of service was spot on, with a comfortable, timely flow of courses. There were a few tables celebrating birthdays and the staff renditions of "Happy Birthday" was fun for all the diners, not just the lucky birthday celebrants.The food served for my meal was delicious. Good quality, fresh produce cooked, plated and served with great care made for a very memorable dinner. The lobster, sashimi and wagyu beef dishes which had led me to order this menu were excellent. There was sufficient quantity of food in the courses to satisfy my appetite.Keyaki is a delightful restaurant in an unexpectedly lovely setting given that it is on Level 4 of the Pan Pacific Singapore. It was a real treat to dine here
5
We had our dinner here last night. The experience was great from the start to the end. Their Teppanyaki sets and A la carte menu offer great choices of beef and seafood. Although we did not have the private room, we were served by a very experience and confident waiter by the name of Andrew, who gave excellent services. As it was a private family celebration of our 25th wedding anniversary, Andrew arranged a small complementary cake for us. The ambience was perfect for the occasion and we even had a good chat with one of the Chef to learn about how to choose a good & just ripe Japanese musk melon ! Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience for the family with great quality food and excellent services

To avoid the crazy rush, we chose to have our Chinese New Year (CNY) reunion dinner at Keyaki private room this year. Other than the usual items, they're offering the seasonal items and 'Yu-Sheng' or Chinese sashimi salad, a must for Singaporen Chinese. We had the Yu-sheng; Keyaki's version was like a fusion of Chinese and Japanese cuisines-4 types of raw fishes and as per our requested, no salmon sashimi; thin gold and silver foils topped the bed of colourful salads, crispy pumpkin strips, fishes in different shades of pink, red and white, it was a perfect visual treat. The sweet sauce (denoted liquid gold flowing into the house, according to local custom) was just right.We ordered the kaiseki (personal 9 courses traditional Japanese meal)- seasonal Hokkai kaiseki (kinki fish), Ten (sky in Japanese), Yuki (snow) and Keyaki's special. The sashimis were fresh as usual, my 'botan prawn' and scallop sashimi were very good-we ordered additional portion to share. wagyu beef was grilled to perfection, soft and 'melting' ( in my girl's word). Dishes were good to look at, best to feast on.We're served by an attentive lady, who apologised for delay due to the festive crowd, well, we understood, looked like the other families are doing what we've practised for years, 'avoid Chinese restaurants during CNY'. It was also my kid's birthday, so we were given a complimentary chocolate cake which was very good. This is one of our favourite for special occasions and family gathering, never disappointed as the food and service standard have been very consistent. They're known for their teppanyaki. As with other good Japanese restaurant, ordering seasonal produces and sashimi is the best bet. Of course, ordering Katsu (my hubby's favourite) is perfectly alright too. They offer complimentary parking too, just ask when making payment. After the meal, take a stroll in its garden and admire the koi pond, when late, the koi fishes would line in an very orderly manner, guess that's the way they sleep (do they?). You could also see the flyer from here

I visited there for business dinner. I had been there for a few times, but this visit was worst. The service was very slow and took ages for them to serve drink. The food was average only and nothing fantastic. The quality was not there. It used to be much better. They used to serve better and more authentic food
5
Ate here with a colleague last night.The food (Sashimi followed by Tapenyakki beef, prawns and chicken) was faultless.Service is excellent and no complaints other than the place was devoid of people so the atmosphere suffered somewhat.This is not a 'show' like Benihana, it's well prepared quality food
3
Singapore is not home to many quality Japanese or teppanyaki places. Chose this for a 20 person business dinner and although the restaurant itself was nice, the teppanyaki was average. Not sure the chefs were highly trained teppanyaki experts. Wine was super expensive, although it is in Singapore in general. Would have chosen an alternative location for such a large party.
3
I had high hopes for this place when I arranged a dinner here for myself plus 3 visiting colleagues but unfortunately the overall experience was fairly mediocre. I ordered the Chirashi sushi set whilst my colleagues ordered the vegetarian set, the Moriawase sushi set, and the Sukiyaki set. My Chirashi sushi set was really nothing special and the sushi was similar to what I've experienced at mid range sushi establishments in Singapore. I'd have to say that at $80++ it was not particularly good value for money. The vegetarian set seemed to be more pleasing to one of my colleagues, whilst the other 2 meals were generally regarded as just ok. The overall bill came to about $500 SGD including service and GST. There's definitely better value out there, but on a Sunday night there aren't too many choices for decent Japanese food
4
Went there with friends visiting Singapore. The restaurant is nice and the food is really good. The quality of the fish and rice for the sushi is great and you fell it on the bill. For such an expensive restaurant, they really need to improve the service. Our waitress was not at all up to speed.All in all still a good experience and we'll go back.
5
Ate here having just stepped off a flight and had a fantastic bowl of Wagyu udon noodles... just what was required. my colleague had the sushi which also looked great and was apparently very good. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet given how good the food was, but it was mid week.I'd be happy to stop here again!
3
So overpriced. And in order to get there, you need to walk through the stinky Pan Pacific hall, which is a challenge... Too bad, the place in itself is nice and the food is good.
5
To be honest we were at a bit of a loose end for dinner plans. We were staying at the Pan Pacific but had walked for miles during the day sight seeing and didn't want to for far for a bite to eat. Then, we happened upon this restaurant on one of the floors and took a look inside, talked ourselves past the fact that it seemed pricey and booked a table.This turned out to be a fabulous decision. We had our own personal chef prepare our dinner in front of us, had a lovely time, great service, the food itself was awesome and I'd recommend it to anyone.Just save up your pennies and you'll really enjoy it
5
Really really good food and service, which is really hard to find in singapore! I loved the setting outside which is like a japanese garden. It's a huge space and great for both dates and family outings. Bring date to meet family dinners? :p only complaint is that many of their seasonal things run out really fast :(
5
For over a couple of decades we have unfailingly enjoyed the outstanding Japanese cuisine, especially teppanyaki dishes, delivered with style by Keyaki chefs. Today's a la carte teppanyaki lunch was no exception, and the quality of the prawns, scallops, and salmon choices was superb, as was the professional and engaging style of Eamon, our chef, together with the other service staff. Highly recommended for an authentic Japanese experience and quality food
4
For all types of Japanese cuisine there are few better cities outside Japan than Singapore.For a recent business dinner, we made reservations at Keyaki, having enjoyed its excellent preparation and choices in the past.One can certainly pay less (we averaged USD $150/apiece plus drinks), but it would be difficult to find a better value.Several of us went with the fixed price selections that included waygu beef, salshimi (hot and cold), miso and other tasty items.Located in the Pan Pacific Hotel, Keyaki is easy to find and reasonable on one's wallet
5
I was glad to return to Keyaki again after a few years away. Located in the grand Pan Pacific, Keyaki's Japanese garden with its raked sand and pond of gorgeous school of koi remain a lovely entrance. The restaurant ambience is zen-like elegance. Every dish on the menu sounded tempting. We opted for the Keyaki set, each dish was absolutely delicious, delicate and flavoursome. The sake base cocktail Rakuen was refined and delicate too. The wine and sake menu list was extensive and the staff was helpful as I preferred a medium dry sake. Service was very polite, attentive and helpful. The only comment I would suggest is to pace the serving a fee more minutes between dishes
4
The restaurant is located in the beautiful Pan Pacific hotel, removed from traffic although it can be heard if seated outdoors. We were placed at in indoors table at first but we asked to move as the temperature was arctic! The sushi and sashimi are amazing and prices are rather high, but when I leave a restaurant that content, the weight of my wallet feels less important :
5
I recently attended Keyaki during a business lunch and liked it so much I took my partner back the very next evening. I had to enter the restaurant through a sculpted garden and Koi pond which really gave the impression of stepping into a little Japanese world. Inside the restaurant, the kitchen is open, meaning I could watch my food being prepared. Service was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious, also quite classy/upscale so I’m planning to go back with clients for a business dinner. 
4
For Japanese in Singapore, sometimes we want to have legitmate Japanese foods, for such moment we go to Keyaki to have Japanese foods.The taste of Teppanyaki and Sashi etc is just same as in Japan.But price is not so cheap, so we can not go there many times
3
I've been to Keyaki a number of times for work lunches. Whilst I love the food and venue, the service often is inconsistent and at generally slow. Today I went for a meal with an important client. When I arrived, I asked for a quieter table. My guest then came I and was seated the original table where I couldn't see him. 20 minutes later we realised he was on the wrong table where we couldn't see him and the hotel staff didn't realise. He is never late - he was not happy and the meal was rushed. I've has too many cases of inconsistent service and having to hurry the wait staff not to go back again. It's a shame as the food is very good
4
Food was so-so.....ambience was nice though...
We had Sashimi, lobster, wangyu beef.
The food standard used to be better.
5
we were lucky to get s table as this was a spontaneous decision..... and a very good one. We had fabulous experience watching our food being prepared and it tasted delicious! highly recommended.
5
Adding this place to my favorite list. Had the usual Tempura and chawan mushi ..then some sake, my peers ordered a large sushi boat then more sake. Followed bu more sashimi then more sake.Leaving the restaurant a little heavier and happier :
5
The restaurant is on the 3rd floor of the Pancific Hotel at Marina Bay area. It is set alongside a Japanese style garden. It mainly serves teppanyaki but has choice of set meals and a la carte. The price of the set meals are quite reasonable. Service was excellent. Guests of the Pan Pacific Hotel enloy 30% discount
5
Entry through the sculpted roof top gravel garden, cross by the Koi carp pond and enter via a minimalist sliding door to equally minimalist and elegant decor inside. I ate at the sashimi bar and had, of course, sashimi. On the pricy side but utterly sublime, i could have eaten the menu - fresh, light, exquisite and beautifully prepared by the sashimi chefs in front of your eyes. Teppanyaki, rare was melt in the mouth and delicious and accompanied by smoke udon noodles and an appetiser of sesame spinach. All delicious. Definitely recommended. Pan Pacific guests get a 30% discount
5
The sashimi, sushi and teppanyaki are very good. Wine list is more varied than normal and offers several really good yet reasonable options. (We are Marlborough Sauv Blanc fans and saw Ned's, Cloudy Bay and Craggy Range on the list.) Personally, we did not like the sweetened soy sauce offered, but the restaurant had standard Kikkoman's available at our request, so no issue there. Staff were very good but not hovering over the table. Too much attention is sometimes a problem in Japanese restaurants, but not here. Only negative, sadly for the restaurant, is that they are in a large hotel and this means that sometimes ill-behaved guests will bring their children and let them run around or make a lot of noise. Perhaps the Pan Pac could support this excellent restaurant by asking guests not to take very young (or spoiled-rotten) kids! : 
5
I would definitely recommend this restaurant in Singapore. Food is simply amazing! Staff are very friendly! Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the chef who cooked for us, but he was so so so much great!!
5
I have been to this restaurant as a guest of the Pan Pacific Hotel,seated right at the sushi bar where I could sea the impeccable performance of the chef Kazuo Sato and his second, I choose at first the angler fish liver served in a pot with seaweed and cucumber with a delicate sauce by the side: delicate and tangy.As main I had a sushi selection plus a choice of my favourite scallop and tuna belly the freshness and the taste of the fish displayed was incredible!!!than to satisfy my self completely I had a sashimi of just scallop and tuna belly,the scallop were so fresh that almost I didn't need to chew it!Service is highly welcoming and professional.So far one of the best sushi outside Japan, if you are in Singapore and you love sushi as much as I do you can't miss this place
2
The food was bland. We order almost everything from sashimi to lobster to waygu beef. All were disappointing. The only saving grace was the servic
5
I had looked up places to host a group of 6 people and came across Keyaki on Trip Advisor. The reviews were really good so I decided to book a table for Teppanyaki. Getting a reservations was realatively smooth and seamless. When I asked for the menu before-hand, the team without any hesitation sent it across as well. When you arrive at Keyaki, there is a really nice Japanese garden and the decor is very nice inside. Already, the guests I were with were impressed. I had a good feeling when we got there that this would be great.The service at the restaurant was unbelievable. The men chose a nice bottle of sake from Niigata and the women we were with had a nice bottle of white wine. Never did we have to turn our heads to pour drinks into our glasses, the team were very attentive. Food wise, the quality of food was top notch. The sashimi was so fresh to start the course. Then the lobster and wagyu were divine. Highly recommend this place for a very nice meal out with your wife, girlfriend, taking clients out or just having a good time with your friends.You can reserve a table through this site or calling the Pan Pacific Hotel. I'm actually going back again this Saturday
5
I went this restaurant with family for lunch. Teyaki in pan pacific is good for family and also business. There's various of Japanese menu and it's not hesitate to foreigner. Specially, Mi hee Oh,my table server was nice and made me visit once again.
5
I have visited and dine in many Japanese fine dining restaurant. This is one of the best that I ever had. Just recall that we celebrate in this restaurant in 2012.Very nice cod fish and sashimi. I must say the service and ambience was fantastic. This is one of the very consistent outlet. Different experience compare with bay sushi and sushi tei. Hide Yamamoto in MBS is comparable but not the service level.I would recommend this to all traveller. For sure no doubt, I will visit this restaurant in the upcoming month..
5
We had lunch on a Sunday and were impressed with the ambiance both outdoor and indoor. During that time, the place was quiet and we dined at a leisurely and enjoyable pace. The food was good and were most impressed with Andrew who introduced the different dishes to us. He certainly exhibits professionalism and knowledge. We enjoyed our meal and would recommend the restaurant to my friends
5
Thank you to Andrew for making our dinner very enjoyable. His knowledge of the food and how to eat every item was amazing, he was able to explain everything in detail and with a lot of feeling. Amazing service from him. we really enjoyed our dinner and will return when next in Singapore
3
I dinned in this restaurant for the first time and it was recommended by my hotel to go to, the atmosphere is nice from inside but from outside the terrace it was a beautiful Japanese garden style.The food was good; but I had a much better Japanes food than this place with less luxury style and much better food quality.They did couple of mistakes by not listening to the order very well, they need to know that some people are allergic to some things or religiously they donâ€™t eat or drink it. But they did correct their mistake only after we have noticed it. Maybe our experiance was not good but i am sure the food qulaity is good and can be better a fixed
4
Went to have dinner at Keyakion a Sunday night. The restaurant was quite busy. We ordered a Sukiyaki set, some sushi, donburi sets and sashimi.Half way thru the Sukiyaki, we found a strand of hair in it. We informed the staff and they had it changed straight away. After our dinner, the restaurant manager gave us complimentary ice cream as an apology. We were pleased with their actions and the staff were very friendly and helpful.We will definitely visit Keyaki again
5
This restaurant is certainly one of the best japanese restaurant I had been in Singapore. I love the sakae for its lightness, smoothness and easy to drink. The wagyu beef is tender and it tastes so good without any sauce. The staffs were friendly and attentive to our needs. Drinks were refilled promptly and the plates were changed frequently. Excellent ambience, food and service. Will definately go back again.
5
I would like to highly recommend keyaki for good quality japanese food. The sashimi was super fresh, wagyu beef literally melts in the mouth!Its centrally located at pan pacific hotel. Atmosphere was good and trqnquil. Great for dating and friends gathering. I would also likes to commend on their service. The staffs were all friendly and very prompt on their service. We were served by lester. Me and friends are all impressed by his knowlege of food and he has given us very good recommendation of food.it is definitely a place I would come back again. And if you would like to have authentic jap food, you have to give this place a try
5
We came with a group of five from 4 different countries on 3 different continents and we all loved it. Especially the Maki - we tried all but the Tempura Maki - were sensational, the best I ever had. I will never forget the Spicy Tuna Maki, which we immediately reordered for a 2nd round! Great service with Lester going the extra mile for us.Only downside for me personally was that no single draft beer was on offer, while I believe Japanese have some of the best draft beers in the world
5
We had the omakase set, the food was good and served on a timely basis. That aside, I wish to comment on the excellent service of Andrew. He was all smiles and v polite the moment we stepped into the restaurant. He made an effort to explain each of the dishes to us, every time with a warm smile. What blew us away was that he got us a cake on the house when he heard it was my partner's birthday. Thank you Andrew, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Keyaki
5
The food was very nice, and we so enjoy having our dinner at here(keyaki). Thanks for the staff, Elsa,Corine and Andrew..
5
I have nothing negative to say, great food, service, atmosphere, ambiance. Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore who wants a nice dinner. A bit pricey, but worth it.
5
Best Food excellent Service done by Andrew.we enjoyed it very much.We felt like in Japan where er lived for 4 years.congratulation.we will come again
3
The 'old' Keyaki was great, one of the best teppanyaki joints in town. When the Pan Pacific shut down for it's extensive refit, so did Keyaki and whilst the new version is shiny and easy on the eye it has completely lost its' ambience, character and most importantly its' food has taken a huge turn South.It's a little hard to put one's finger on where it's gone so wrong but it feels much more akin to a Japanese fast food joint than the quality old stager that it used to be. Prices have certainly not dropped to match the new standards and it must be said and the service also seems to have lost some of the charm. It's safe to say that during the refit, Keyaki lost its' soul. What a shame
5
My wife and I returned recently to this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary, our first visit in just over a decade. One of Singapore's most established Japanese restaurants (it opened in 1987), I was also eager to re-acquaint myself with their well-known cuisine. While the recent renovations had certainly modernised the look of the restaurant, I couldn't help feeling that it had lost a little of its original cosiness. Nevertheless, it was still elegantly decorated. Feeling the need to splurge a little, I opted for the signature Hiru Kaiseki, a 9-course degustation meal and hoped to be impressed...and I wasn't disappointed. Because May falls under spring/summer, the style of the dishes were light (compared to fall/winter), featuring more steaming or grilling in the preparation. Ingredients used were also generally seasonal. I certainly enjoyed the three different appetisers, one of which featured a sort of custard made of peanut, something I had not expected to encounter in Japanese cooking, There were also two soups, one of which centred around bamboo shoots and mushrooms, the other featuring meat dumpling and fish roe. The sashimi had generous cuts of tuna and salmon, and the sweetfish was grilled nicely with salt. Serving staff were excellent - thanks to Corine who was extremely unobstrusive yet attentive and informative when necessary. My wife and I certainly enjoyed a stress-free meal and the overall experience. Much as we wouldn't mind returning soon, perhaps it's better not going too soon - say, another 10 years - just to make it that much more meaningful
5
We visited Keyaki on Easter Sunday brunch. As we went past the man-sized Tanuki, it felt like we were being transported to Japan. The serene Japanese garden and pond filled with Koi reminded me of my years in Kobe. We were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was not packed though there was a good sized crowd. It must be Singapore's well kept secret. For about 5000 Japanese yen, the Sunday brunch set was excellent in taste, quality and value. Imagine an 8-course lunch that covers practically all my favorite Japanese cuisine from sashimi, chawamushi, cod teriyaki, sushi rolls, beef teppanyaki, shrimp/vegetable tempura, miso, green tea ice cream...And service was truly just great. Our green tea was always refilled by the attentive tea server. Truly a worthwhile place to visit
4
we visited Keyaki during a recent trip to Singapore where we stayed at the Pac Pacific Hotel. The food was very good Japanese. We were given a table outside in the Japanese Garden it was very nice although missing a little atmosphere as we were the only one outside. The food is a little expensive. The service was very goo
4
Enjoyed a great lunch with friends at Keyaki. The fixed Sunday brunch menu was excellent. Good quality and variety. Have been to Japan many times and this compares very favourably. Great location and ambience. Good value for money, although drinks were expensive. Can't understand why simple drinks like beer have to be so expensive
5
the koi pond is simple and nice.. the interior of the restaurant is simple with a large space at the middle.. Environment is acceptable with kidSet lunch is expensive but it is good with the beef and seafood Udon is excellent my daughter love it.. which is rare as she is a very picky eater. It is fine to spurge once in a while.. Cost around less than SGD 200 for 2A1
1
upon arrival at the pan pacific hotel, u feel delighted with the newly renovated lobby. taking the elevator up to keyaki - it brightened up your mood further with the japanese concept garden outside the restaurant (perharps the best design japanaese restaurant in singapore). nevertheless, when the food start to arrive and after tasting it...it is a total disappoinment. the sushi and sashimi taste no different from those selling in sakae or ichiban boshi. the tepanyaki is equally disappointing. in summary, this is a place for ambience and not for the food, and they are charging exorbitant prices. for this pricing, there are many others better place like shirashi, tatsuya et
4
A restaurant with a nice and cosy ambience. Great food is served together with great service. A place worth for gathering with friends...
5
Wow, what a great experience. Friendly and helpful staff, which thoroughly explained the dishes and helped us with all aspects, from choosing the right menu to how you best "approach" it with your chopsticks. Pricey, yes, but a fantastic experience!
5
I ordered some sashimi and deep fried oysters, the food was delicious and the service quite good!
Definitely will come back.
5
Been there a couple of times with friends. Food was fresh and nice. Thumbs up for the great service and recommendation from Vincent :) Cosy enviroment and nice ambience! A place that you MUST try. Definitely worth what you are paying for!

Decided to do a different meal for Chinese New Year Reunion dinner and I decided on Keyaki since I like Japanese, mum doesn't take raw food.Is located on level 4 of Pan Pacific Hotel in Downtown Core. What's interesting is you will need to pass a zen like garden, walkway and koi pond before you enter the restaurant. Is an exclusive establishment, an enclave on it's own in a busy city like Singapore. To your right will be the bar counter seats and left, main dining hall. We chose the counter seat since that is where you can interact freely with the chef, see what they have instead of using a menu and get your food rightaway!We ordered Ise Ebi (Lobster from Japan), Hokkaido scallops, Kagoshima oyster, grilled Kanpachi cheek with salt, US prime Sirloin, Kagoshima pork, Wagyu beef, Enoki mushroom, garlic fried rice, Macha ice cream with fresh fruit, rice dumpling and red bean. The food tasted absolutely delicious - very fresh and you can taste their sweetness even with just pepper and salt as seasoning. We had hojicha, champagne and Yuzu-tini (martini which is flavored with Yuzu, a citrus fruit from Japan). There was good interaction with the chef, service was of a high level with staff being friendly, alert and responsive. I was even presented a 500g chocolate cake since this is my birthday month! All you need to do is to be a Pan Pacific member. You also earn reward points as you dine which allows redemption for room stays, dining, drinks. We spent almost $500 for two in this meal and is worth every single pennies! This place is recommended for special occasions, business, family, party and even solo. If you don't want to spend too much, they have business set lunches which is about 60-100+ per person.I like to return to this restaurant
5
I have been to this restaurant for my wedding anniversary every year. We love the seafood teppanyaki as the food is served fresh and delicious. This time we also tried the weekend brunch, which was thumbs up! The staff were also prompt in refilling our green tea and ensuring our table was sparkling clean. After the satisfying meal, we strolled at the Japanese themed garden just outside the restaurant. The view overlooking Singapore is fantastic and not to forget the beautiful kois in the pond. I would still go back to Keyaki for our annual anniversary in the coming years
3
I went to this restaurant with my family to celebrate a birthday. We have been to Japan many times and used to live there for 10 years, so we know our Japanese food. We had heard quite good things about this restaurant, and people said it was reasonably priced. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were overwhelmed by the beautiful decor and the charming service, however the mood was quickly destroyed when we looked at the menu and saw very few items less than $60. Even the sashimi was $6 per piece. Absurd. Instead of leaving the restaurant we simply had no other drinks that the free water and set ourselves a budget of how much we could spend. None of us at more than 3 pieces of sashimi and vegetables and we left hungry with empty wallets. I would only recommend going to this restaurant if you are not the one paying, otherwise save your money and go somewhere else
5
Went here after searching for a few different options and it did not dissapoint. Was Boxing Day and no one answered when i tried to book a table so took the risk and walked there from The Fullerton. Great setting as you walk through the Japanese Gardens on the way through and got a seat at the Teppanyaki Bar. Went al-acarte and is definitely the way to go. For 3 people with a bottle of wine was under S$400 including taxes, tip etc. Eric was our chef and was really good... Go the beef / 2 of the mushrooms were excellent / so was the mixed vegatables and prawns. Will definitely go back. Apart from Kyoto this was one of our favourite Teppanyaki places we have been to around the world.

Had a nice dinner at Keyaki on 20-Dec-2012 with my fiancee.I ordered the beef sukiyaki and the TEN teppanyaki set. The food was good. Especially the wayu beef is one of the best that I have tried so far.The ambience is quiet and nice for a couple dinner outing.I have to specially comment on one of the service staff Andrew Chiew for his prompt and polite service.Will definitely go back again

We went to this restaurant and found the atmosphere lovely but the food not great. We had the fillet, chicken and cod tepanyaki and they were all ok but not great, seemed to lack in flavour. The garlic rice is more garlic than rice and we love garlic just not to this extent. The noodles were tasteless and the service not bad but they don't understand much english so things get a little confusing. Will not go back.

High quality Teppanyaki restaurants in Singapore have seen a decline in numbers over the years. Keyaki, located in the Pan Pacific Hotel, is 1 of the few remaining good ones. It is a bit pricey but the quality of food is assured there.

I tried the sashimi was nice and some sushis loved it. Realy good place not too expensive easy to get there.
5
Excellent quality , but slightly pricey.
Good ambiance and location.
Check out any special promotions or packages.

Newly renovated, located on the 4th floor of the Pan Pacific Hotel. Very extensive menu for both lunch and dinner. When you don't have to back to work, try the teppanyaki bar.

This restaurant is kinda passé ! Gd for bring children otherwise. Big enough to run around.

The ambience of Keyaki is really lovely, made me feel I was back in a high end hotel in Tokyo.We had a teppanyaki lunch and it was both enjoyable and tasty. I loved the salmon and fried rice the best.On the expensive side but you are in the Pan Pacific..

We are just wrapping up a great week in SG and have well and truly sampled the great culinary diverity that makes SG such a great place. We were hankering for some jap and decided on Keyaki after our mandatory review of TA.we conider ourselves to be veteran foodies and sorry to say, that this was frankly very over-rated....Sure the service / ambience / freshness were all indeed great however you cant eat either and after trying six or seven offerings from across what is a very diverse menu, bland and uninspired best sum up our experience.....maybe the chef had a cold?While i am a firm believer that you can never put a price on an amazing meal... $300 for two (including a few cleansing ales but no wine) was neither value nor reflective of the quality of the meal.This is the first time i have ever written a negatve review on TA and feel a little guilty in case it was just an off night but given the overwhelming positive reviews i thought some balance was justified....

Japanese restaurant located in the Pan Pacific Hotel. The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere from the garden path to the entrace. Sevice was quick and polite. Menu was very extensive. I like vegettables, and I usually love appetizers as the chef to be a little creative. The food is good bur not as good as the prices. In brief, average restaurant -at a top ecpensive pric

Well I havent tried the other famous Jap places in SG yet, but my experience at Keyaki did impress me. The teppanyaki was quite out of this world, skewered almost to perfection. Tempura was also done really well. Sashimi was actually just average in my opinion, I have tried better sashimi elsewhere. The service here was attentive and professional. However, what made my experience a little less pleasant was that I booked a window seat but was given a place 2 seats away from the window, Nevertheless it worked to my favour anyway as the window is between an outdoor table and an indoor table, so you don't actually get much privacy. All in all, great Jap food. But the ambience of this restaurant is more suited for families than couples in my view

We made a 6:30 reservation at Keyaki because we had such a good experience at Keyaki Restaurant in the Sari Pan Pacific in Jakarta. We entered through covered walkways as light evening rain fell on the Japanese garden. We were shown to a table for two in a comfortable location by the windows. My wife ordered agedashi tofu, unagi sushi, aburi wagyu sushi, and a California maki roll. They were all fresh and prepared to perfection, and she was able to taste each of the dishes that came with my Keyaki kaiseki, the ever-changing multi-course meal that is created by the chef according to the season and availability of local foods. The first appetizer was seaweed with carrot and sauce. We had another appetizer consisting of soybean on cucumber, parma ham on melon, tuna in sesame sauce, Japanese seaweed block, and leek soaked in wine. The next dish was clam with sakura flower in clear soup. The next dish was a siso leaf with sashimi sea bream and stripjack and tuna with radish on a bed of ice. The next was wagyu beef on radish with radishes on the side. It was so tasty that I’m afraid we’ll be haunted by that flavor at every Japanese restaurant that we visit. The next dish was white baitfish steamed with seaweed. It was soupy and not very tasty. The side dish was sea urchin sushi and grilled salmon sushi. Next was lobster tempura, a real treat. The main was flat noodles with spring onions. My dessert was yuzu (Citrus) ice cream with strawberry on the side, and my wife had green tea ice cream. They did well with many of our regular favorites, and we discovered new flavors. Although we have eaten frequently at Japanese restaurants, we are not yet experienced enough to fully appreciate the subtle tastes or even the artistic presentations in the kaiseki course. Our well-trained (many of her habits seemed Japanese) and patient waitress was from Malaysia. We feel Keyaki is an outstanding Japanese restaurant that deserves its high ranking on TripAdvisor

Good traditional Japanese dishes, but there are definitely better places in Singapore. I highly recommend the tempura moriwase.
5
The sashimi here is lovely. Everything we tried was good. Will definitely visit again. Wonderful dinner experience!
5
I said experience because it was not just the food which was good , the staff were amaxzing, helpful in assisting us in chosing unfamiliar food , ambience at the restaurant so good
5
Amazing food, good service and ambience. Very expensive.
5
Very authentic Japanese fine-dining( Kaiseki style cuisines), with lots of privacy as you dine.
Every dish is specially designed and each dish is absolutely tasty. The waitress is very attentive and could explain each dish to us.

I tried the set meal (Kaiseki) and it was great! Ordered only 1 set to be shared by 2 and also some ala carte side dishes. It was enough for the 2 of us. Food was great and we enjoyed it very much. The entrance was grand though and it gave me a good impression but once I entered the dining hall, it was altogether different. Too open and lack of privacy. Worth trying but be prepared to pay. Price on the high side

This review is more like a trip down memory lane for moi so please bear with me or just skip to the next reviewer if you are pressed for time. Anyway in the good old days, The Pan Pacific Hotel had a wonderful card. For $xxx amount of money for its membership, we can have 50% off the bill for two diners, 30% for three, 20% for four....you get the picture. So at that time Pan Pacific had a few wonderful restaurants. One was its excellent BBQ buffet with imported Kobe beef, Keyaki and the other was this wonderful Italian restaurant with such a romantic ambience you feel like you are in a cosy restaurant in some coastal italian village. Too cut a long story short, it was excellent value for money as these restaurants are very expensive ala-carte and since SO and myself were always eating out when we were younger and burn calories every milli second, it was the best deal ever. OK back to Keyaki, after reading other reviewers, it seems they had done a reno and changed the look. Sad. Keyaki had an old worldly charm of pre-war Japan with its koi pond and secret rooms and different sections for different styles....my fave was the robatayaki. Yup those were the decadent days.. until the kids started coming and college fund beckons. Ah well. Oh what was I writing about...right... should still be standard par excellent. Fresh food, good service, great ambience... but I can never understand the $%#&* fruit platter... it was as expensive as ordering otoro. And it is only LOCAL fruits like watermelon etc. not even imported japanese fruits like honey dew. So there you have it my two cents worth. The date of last visit that I mark is wrong since they dont have a date that back up to 1990s. Duh

I have been to Keyaki long time but stopped since it as renovate and the chef was changed. I recently heard the former chef has returned and immediately made a reservation. I actually prefered the last time ambience which had more private roomand robatayaki counter. Current Keyaki is looks too open and no privacy.We of course had chef special kaiseki menu. We really enjoyed it. The sweet fish with miso paste was good starting good for sake. The appetiser was nice presentaton with seasonal ingredients. The turban shell was served with flame and looks really nice. All thefoo has taste and flavor. It is quite authentic so who prefer fusion or unique dish may not prefer this reataurant dish. I am quite happy that the chef has back andcould enjoy his food again. I will start come back again

The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere from the garden path to the entrance. The service is very attentive, and the restaurant is very relaxing compared to the bustle of most of Singapore. The tables could use some division between them, as they are well-spaced, but when the restaurant is empty, it seems a bit vast. In brief, the food is good, but not as good as the prices would have you hope. There is no reason not to go here if you can easily afford it. The location can't be beat for guests of the hotel. However, if you're considering trying it as a treat, you can probably get better value for your money elsewhere in Singapore. I decided to treat myself to a late supper at the Keyaki after arriving "home" to the Pan Pacific after a late evening at work. I ordered the 9 piece Nigiri set meal for SG$120 in part to avoid having to make any selections. I like sushi, and japanese food in general, so it was a safe bet in a good restaurant. Eating alone allowed me a little more time than usual to contemplate the meal, so don't get me wrong, it was good, just not nearly good enough food for the price. :)The set meal included an appetiser, 9 pieces nigiri, tuna maki, and a fruit plate for dessert. The first course was a tiny teacup with a seasoned lotus root salad. It was ok. This was quickly followed, well, overlapped, by the actual appetiser with was three tiny teacups, containing: a creamy, shredded crab dish (ok, a little sweet), a taste of minced salmon and shredded daikon salad (ok), and a minced chicken... something. I like vegetables, and I usually love appetizers as the chef gets to be a little creative. I wouldn't have requested seconds of any of these.The Nigiri was good. Not the best I've had, but probably the most expensive. The plate was beautifully presented, including tuna maki, five pieces of fish nigiri, (salmon, toro, hamachi, and two others I can't recall), ebi, Nori-wrapped sea urchin, and salmon roe. A section of watermelon and a single strawberry, cut in half, made up the fruit plate. This is where I had hoped for a nice, juicy slice of orange, or some excellent pear. Alas, strawberries don't seem to be very good in Singapore, and this strawberry was pale and flavourless. It's hard to mess up watermelon, and it was good.Service was quick and polite. I never had to ask for more tea, as my cup was kept full. It struck me that the tea was too hot to drink, as I had read once that Japanese brew their tea a little under boiling, and make sure that it is the correct temperature to drink before serving, hence not having any handles on the teacups. I'm not sure if this is truth or fabrication, but I had to gingerly set down my tea cup to let it cool, as the tea served from insulated carafes was too hot to drink right away

Celebrated my wife's birthday there last night with family members. Total we had 6 adults and we called in to make a reservation at the very last minute. Asked for a private room but was informed that all rooms had been taken. However, the wait staff was kind enough to sit us at a semi-private corner at the main dining hall. Not too bad at all.The minute u walked through the door from the hotel, there seems to be a change of atmosphere altogether. We strolled through the well sculptured garden that gave us a slight indication of what to expect, well planned and authentic Japanese dinner. The garden is beautiful and pleasent. The servers were all dressed in kimonos and that's commendable as this added to the "in Japan" feel that the restaurant is trying to create (my assumption). Staff were friendly and I thought I saw some of the servers are actually Japanese. Now as for the food. I had the wagyu beef set ($140) and my wife ordered the seafood set ($90). The others ordered the shira wagyu and lobster set ($250). First we had the amuse bouche which was hinting on what to expect next. The octopus sashimi is so soft and juicy that it brings a smile across my face on the first taste. I am not a fan of this as I found it rather hard and rubbery each time I have this. But it's really different here at keyaki. My heart roars with anticipation after this. The rest of the amuse bouche (don't remember their names and ingredients) were just as good and tasty. The sashimi was of a good quality. The salmon sashimi was so soft and juicy. Of cos, the toro (tuna belly) was even better. The tempura was so-so, nothing to comment on except that the prawn tempura was huge and juicy. Now the wagyu was good, but not fantastic. Had asked the server which grade of wagyu they are serving but they could not answer me. Anyway, the desserts are simply fruits, imported from Japan I assumed. We had a birthday cake and when the served it, few servers actually walked in and sing a bd song for my wife and her twin sister which was greatly appreciated. Generally, I felt that the restaurant is unpretentious and warm. They even have a small hut located in the garden for smokers.As for the pricing, I believed sincerely from my heart, we were paying for good quality food and they don't come cheap. I have been to Japan a couple of times and had Japanese food in Japan numerous times and I sincerely think that keyaki is better than a lot of them in terms of quality and ambience. I have to give them credit for trying To create a little Japanese corner in the little yet vibrant lion city and I would seriously say that they have done a great job, not compromising on culinary skills and quality of food

Slowly learning (it's the age I suppose:-) that TripAdvisor reviews are to be taken with a pinch of salt - not the other reviewers' fault, I suppose. When reviewing a Japanese restaurant, for example, there's no box one can tick as to whether the reviewer has ever been to Japan...Keyaki is an honest (though far from perfect) attempt to immitate a kaiseki restaurant in Tokyo. Very pretentious - probably good enough to satisfy someone who's never had the "real thing", mainly in terms of presentation.Ingredient quality is OK - but taste? Hmmm... That's another story.Summary: would only recommend for someone desperate tp show off, not having been to Japan and not planning to go any time soon. Value for money - just N/A here:-

We have stayed at Pan Pacific hotel and decided to have dinner at Keyaki just before leaving for the airport on our last night in Singapore.I think what really makes this restaurant stand out is its level of service; they have by far the most attentive staff I have ever come across.Our dedicated chef was amazing and it was a true pleasure having to watch him prepare our meals.My partner had ordered a selection of teppanyaki, all of which were very good. I was glad to see some good choices for vegans/vegetarians - I had a tofu steak with rice set, which was very delicate to taste and beautifully presented. The rice was cooked to perfection.I just wish we had more time to enjoy this wonderful restaurant and not having to rush to the airport!I would highly recommend Keyaki to anyone who is looking for a great Japanese restaurant in Singapore

Visit on early November. Welcomed with warm greeting from the manager and escorted to the table. entirely all the staffs are attentive and always have a smile. when I go to the toilet all the staffs passed through greeted me. It sounds normal but I don't see that all of the staffs doing that everytime even on a very busy dinner time. The food was actually on the par as this price but I believe you will satisfied. We had some sushi, sashimi and teppanyaki. The garlic taset bitter but we still had a good time. The restaurant have quite good selection of sake and if you can open a bottle, should ask for recommendation to the male staffs, they will give you a good choice

It’s difficult to justify $80pp for a meal in Singapore, when you can eat an incredible and delicious meal for <$10pp. But Keyaki is offering something more than food… I’d say it’s selling an experience. My wife and I celebrated her birthday here, and we booked a spot at the Teppanyaki counter. To be honest, the meal itself wasn’t amazing overall (however the Beef Filet Teppanyaki was really special and, if I returned I would only order this dish). But what is lovely is the entire experience… the entry on Level 4 into a private Japanese garden with Koi, the elegant wooden door that opens to greet diners, the beautiful Japanese dresses on the serving staff, the dedicated chef at your own Teppanyaki grill, the unique and inspired Saketinis (Martinis based on Japanese Sake) etc… etc… The whole experience was really special, and I don’t mind paying for that

The 12 of us took a private dining room and it was nice and cosy.Ambience of the rest of the restuarant was styled very Japanese-hut, including a meandering stone-laid stream, nice way to prep us for the Japanese dining experience.We all ordered all different sets from the menu from wagyu beeft sets to tasting menus to shabu shabu with grade 5 kagoshima wagyu beef.My shabu shabu was certainly worth the wait and it is definitely more than enough for one. Two persons sharing would be a better option but it was so good. And normally most Jap shabu shabu start with a light soup stock, the Keyaki's version was robust and great, with a tinge of yuzu and spring vegetables,,,,,very yummy from the start and the wagyu beef, 5 swishes and it was tender, soft, fatty good!My other dining companions were full of praise for their own orders. The tasting menu seemed to go on forever and it is a good testament to tasting a bit of everything. The discovery was certainly worth the price! Enough the simple ebi tempura and ramen (not on menu) for my little daughter was just amazingly good that we ordered one for ourselves!The sake was nice but we didnt get to choose our own glasses,,,,But at the end of the dinner, it was certainly money well spent. We have expected to spend more since there were 12 of us but the bill came up to be below expectations. A great Japanese premium place to eat great delicacies and the best Japanese fresh food. A pity though that the fruits at the end of the dinner were not airflown from Japan. We were looking forward to ending with a slice of Japanese melon.Highly recommended esp for large groups

Keyaki is within the Pan Pacific Hotel central Singapore.We visited for Sunday Lunch and found the food & service very good... they have managed to create a restaurant destination within a hotel... without you really knowing you are in a large corporate style place! Well Done!Brunch was 7 courses... pretty small in size and no choice so you had to have what was given.This included very good sashimi, california rolls, tempura, and ending in a green tea ice cream which was very good.Excellent value around £35 per head including soft drinks.Any questions just ask
5
From the walk through Japanese garden and fish ponds to the greeting at the door you will relax and enjoy the restaurant.Service is superb for Singapore but what you would expect of a 5 star hotel restaurant ( oh so is the prices)Food is suitable for all tastes and adventures and is excellently prepared and served and the wine and saki list is extensive and suits all palatesNot a place to eat 4 times a week but worthy of a visit when in Singapor

My brother and I were staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore (where Keyaki is located) in late October. We were at the end of a vacation to SE Asia and were splurging a little in Singapore to toast our late grandfather – a businessman who loved this town.We made a dinner reservation for 8 p.m. We strolled around the lovely Japanese garden beforehand. The restaurant itself is styled like a (very nice) Japanese house made of Keyaki wood and built using traditional techniques. The ambience is serene and wonderful.We began with 3 Ume Martinis, one for our missing grandfather. Not like his usual dirty martini, but I think he would have approved.We ordered the 10-course set menu, and although it is quite expensive, it was a terrific decision. I don't remember all the courses, but it started with an amuse bouche. We had sashimi, tuna belly, miso, wagyu beef, tea, chesnut ice cream... it was all sublime. The wagyu beef in particular was out-of-this-world.The service was quiet, friendly, and instructional. We had two young ladies waiting on us. They were discrete and mostly stayed out of the way. A perfect level of service in my opinion.This was a special occasion for us and Keyaki did not disappoint. Wow

I would like to compliment Ms Irene Kwek who have provided excellent service. She made an effort to explain to customer on the dishes that we have ordered and recommended what are the good food that serve in the restaurant. She is friendly and polite and exceeded to our request. On top of that, the restaurant atmosphere is quiet and nice
5
Will like to compliment a waitress, by the name of Ms Irene Kwek, her service towards customer is excellent, she'll go extra miles to explain to the customer for every dish that was served to us. The restaurant atmosphere for in door and out door are wonderful. Well done

I love Japanese food. We choosed the menu for SD 120, absolutely heaven.!!
5
I dined here with my new wife as a gift from my brother. We chose the 10 course set menu consisting of a mixture of cooked meat, soup and raw fish. The food was just excellent and the service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself is based on the 4th floor of the Pan Pacific hotel which provides superb views of the Singapore skyline if sitting outside. A special mention needs to be made for our waiter, Andrew, who was friendly, helpful and provided great service throughout the evening. Well recommended for a special occasion
5
We had our dinner at Keyaki on tuesday night. The waiters / waitress there are friendly and willing to give comments and suggestion for our order. The atmosphere and environment are nice, both of us feel relax and comfortable when having our meal. Both of us like the the friendly and attentive services of Keyaki. It is a nice restaurant to recommend to your friends
5
My wife and I had an excellent lunch at Keyaki.I chose a zen menu (mostly sushis and some few makis): the fish and the preparation were awesome. I've drunk a wonderful umeshu.My wife chose a bento (can't really remember the precise name) and it was excellent.The staff did a great work, and we were lucky enough to seat at the sushi bar and talk longly with the chief about France, Japan and other subjects. He is a very nice man and very talented chief !Expensive but highly recommended
5
I had my lunch at Keyaki on Sunday lunch. It is a good time to go with family due to the weekday is packed with business people. It is relaxing and not rushing. we had a week end set brunch which was very reasonable in price and good quantity ( I believe I eat more than average guy and I filled up so much). The service is friendly and attentive, very recommendin
5
We had a full menu, and the dished kept comming at a rapid pace. We had to tell the vaitor to slow down a bit. The food was excellent, and the service very polite and attenative. 100% recomended, and I'd love to go back next time in Singapore
5
The Keyaki Restaurant is set in a very soothing and picturesque atmosphere. The service was great and consistent, and they also provide you with bibs to protect your clothes - very useful for some people ;). Food-wise the sushi and teppanyaki were among the best I have ever tasted. The style with which the chef prepared the food in front of your eyes was an experience that I will remember for some time to come. Not to mention the exquisite taste that ensued.I liked the lobster the most as I don't have it often, and together with the provided sauces - it melted in my mouth.For the least liked, it's honestly difficult to say cause everything was so tasty - however be careful not to order too much as we did!
5
My friends and I went to Keyaki on our last night in Singapore. It's a gorgeous Japanese restaurant in the Pan Pacific Hotel, Singapore. The decor is stunning - there's even a rock garden (Zen-style) outside with a koi pond!Loved the food there - only wish that I'd known in advance the sheer volume of food that we'd end up eating and left more space for it! Everything is made in front of you (if you choose to eat Teppanyaki, like us), and is really fresh. My usual complaint with Teppanyaki is that the cooks end up overcooking the food and it ends up having a dry, brunt taste. But the chef (Eric) made everything very juicy and tender.Everything we ate was at the recommendation of the restaurant manager, Vincent. Eric the chef not only made great food, he also made sure to keep us entertained with his fancy spatula-flipping tricks & "Ring of fire" around the beef!Fair warning, though - it is on the pricey side. This isn't your typical local Singapore street-side stall (as if you couldn't guess). But for us it was completely worth it
5
As mentioned in previous reviews Keyaki is fantastic. I was dining alone so was seated at the sushi bar, which is fun in itself, but everything about Keyaki is a cut above. The food is incredibly fresh and full of flavour - possibly the tastiest salmon sashimi I've ever encountered. The staff were flawless and the atmosphere matched. It was a very enjoyable experience and I recommend the Tiger Rolls. Delicious and very deserving of all the terrific reviews
4
We tried the full taster menu and were blown away with some amazing flavours and tastes.The wagyu beef, sushi and seafood were all wonderful.We also had one of the friendliest waiters you could ask for who seemed genuinely interested in our travels, giving us tips for the rest of our stay and making sure we were happy with the meal
