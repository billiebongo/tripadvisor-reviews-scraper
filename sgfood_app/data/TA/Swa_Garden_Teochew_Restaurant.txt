The rice porridge is very good at Swa Garden. Teochew cuisine is not as common as Cantonese cuisine in Singapore, I like the fact that it is lighter than the usual Chinese food. The Orh Nee or Yam pudding is a must try.

This place serves very down to earth Teochew food. Those like your Mother will cook at home.
Prices are affordable.
Ambience is very average.

Parking will be an issue here. Food is interesting and well priced. Service is good as waitress are attentive and will top up your tea consistently.
The yam paste dessert is pretty ok. Worth a visit.

I am also reviewing Swa Garden with a heavy heart. Since I heard about the news of their closure, I've eaten three times in two weeks. Despite the restaurant being fully packed on the last day, the servers were still all smiles and tried to accommodate every customers. Sadly, they had to turn down customers with no reservations.Food maintained the same standards. You will be missed

I am reviewing this restaurant with a heavy heart after hearing that it will be officially closing down its business this coming Sunday 17 April 2017. This humble restaurant situated with the rows of shophouses along McPherson Road sits quietly between a KTV pub and a Prata shop. Many regular customers return to this restaurant because of its authentic Teochew style dishes at an affordable price. We are not looking at fast food restaurant pricing but as compared to a typical Chinese restaurant. Favorite dishes for many are their traditional Teochew "ou nee" (tapioca pudding) andfried kway teow.

Great service from the serving crew and lady boss is warm and friendly. It was pretty crowded on a weekday night...best to make reservation if you have a large group. Prices quoted on the menu are inclusive of GST, and compulsory tea at $1.20 per pax.We spent about $70 for 3 person (without fish/seafood order).Dishes tried1. Fried Duck Meat with sour plum sauce- 8/102. Prawn & Crab Ball - 6/103. Claypot Beancurd - 9/104. Swa Fried Rice - 7/105. Teochew Orh Nee with Gingko Nut - 7/10 (can be less sweet) If you are thinking of a birthday celebration, they have set menu from $288 onwards with free platter of Longevity buns

The food served at Swa Garden is really good and authentic Teochew style. The restaurant is also very old school with minimal furnishing. My whole family loves the food but the steam pomfret can be very pricey at about $80. The braise goose, fried kway teow and oyster omelette are awesome. Overall, nice food and will definitely be back again.

We brought my Teochew in-laws to sample the cooking. They enjoyed the food very much. It is definitely old-school in ambiance and presentation. They still serve pickled vegetables on the table, one of my bench-marks of an old school restaurant.The Steamed Pomfret was perfectly steamed and delicately seasoned. The Kuey Teow fried with salted radish was tasty with good wok hei, as was the deep fried Prawn Roll and Liver Roll. The Oyster Omelette was fluffy and had a good number of oysters in it. The hostess recommended the braised chicken, which turned out to have huge chicken thighs with mushrooms and pieces of yam. It was tasty enough, but I suspect that was the dish that left me with a feeling of MSG in my mouth after. We ended the meal with the ubiquitous Yam Paste, made in the traditional manner with lard. Even though we ordered a small portion, it was a generous serving. If you want to have the cold crab, be sure to pre-order them. The service staff were friendly and efficient. Prices are generally reasonable unless you order the Pomfret. Our meal for 6 persons came to more than $200

Walk pass this Teochew restaurant . Recommended to try the "stuff chicken" . Look like herbal chicken to me . The hei cho and prawn ball was v good . But disappointment came when the chicken was served. We took one bite , errrr..., to confirm our taste bud, we took the second bite . The chicken meat had a foul smell and we could tell that it had turn bad . The insisted respond we got was that the chicken is "fresh" .I can't believe in this modern era , chef can allow their ego to override their professionalism. Well it seems to me the chef had turn more rotten than the chicken itself. Sigh. Big disappointment

If you want to try Teochew authentic dishes, this is probably the last few places left in Singapore. Even the decor reminds you of the 70/80s ! The meal will not be complete if you don't order their Yam Paste for dessert. However, do be careful of what you order as some of the dishes can set you back quite a bit in terms of costs if you go for the high end dishes

Been regular there for almost 16yrs, usually our family gatherings. Good service always. Try their package menu, worth the value. Steam pomphret is always fresh n sweet, not to miss their braised goose and yam paste.

Was recommended pomfret porridge ($80) and added a Kailan dish ($16), meal came to a ridiculous amount of $102 which I thought could have been better spent elsewhere with better ambience.... Not coming back.... There are better restaurants such as Chin Lee...

Authentic traditional Teochew cuisine. Typical dishes like cold crabs, steamed pomfret, braised goose, yam paste are all highly recommended. Nostalgia interior adds to the dining experience. Cold crabs and pomfret are quite expensive items just FYI.

Swa Garden is one of the few remaining traditional Teochew restaurant. They offer the older version of dishes and taste very different and good
3
Its old decor from the 70s is actually an attraction to some diners, making it both an interesting and memorable experience to dine at this nostalgic Teochew restaurant. Their dishes are authentic and very reasonably priced without service charges and tax. Definitely a keeper!

Swa Garden Restaurant is a gem hidden on the rustic MacPherson Road. It serves authentic Teochew dishes. Its braised duck, steamed lobster, lobster teochew porridge and pan-fried rice noodle were top-notched. I will definitely return for more at this restaurant.

Simple decor harking back to the 80s if not 70s, this restaurant is situated along Macpherson Road nestled between residential and light factories. Service was attentive and professional and most speak English although mandarin or dialect is more common. Enjoyed the chai poh kway teow, steamed pomfret and braised goose and tau kwa. Dessert was the sweet pumpkin 'or nee'. Simply love this place and would always return

The price of the White Pomfret porridge is exorbitant, costing $75/$85 for supposedly 4 to 5 people. But in reality, it is only enough to fill the stomach of 2 diners as the porridge is the Teochew version, so is very liquid with not much grains. If you feel full eating it, it's due to the liquid! Though there were relatively large pieces of fish meat in the porridge, we each only had about 2 pieces swimming in a bowl of very liquid porridge. Paying $20 for my share of porridge and a bit of vegetable, I feel that it was a meal that is certainly not worth the money. If you are a big eater, the portion would be enough just for you. Imagine paying $75 to eat a bowl of fish porridge!If you must go to the restaurant, best try something else as the porridge will not be filling at all. And is not as tasty as well. I certainly will not be visiting the restaurant anytime soon. There is no service charge or GST but these probably have already been tabulated into the price of the dishes considering how expensive it is

The five stars given are based mainly on really good food in this place. The place is in a nostalgic setting akin to how restaurants were like in the 70's of Singapore. Location is a bit away from the central but there's an mrt station nearby such as aljunied and macpheson where you can walk or take a cab and reach within 5 minutes.Try the cold crab, steamed promfret, prawn and crab balls, signature stir fry kuay teow and braised goose. You will not be disappointed. Lastly try the yam dessert or orh-née. Bill is slightly high at about $40 average check per pax but fresh ingredients are used, so it's worth it.Opens from 1130am till 2pm and 6pm till 930p

We ordered the hor fun (no gravy), pan fried, slightly burnt on one side which does not give any bitter taste. Yummy! Another dish which worth tasting is braised goose, the slices of meat is tender. In my next visit, I would want to try cold crab and their yam dessert (orgh nee)\《°°》
