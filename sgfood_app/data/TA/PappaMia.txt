We had lunch at this place quite often but you need to go early as it gets crowded by 12pm and service gets much slower. Tryout their nissin chicken noodle and chicken rice. Really yummy

Came here for dinner and went for the set offer which cost <$30/- for 2 main course, 2 drinks and 6 satay sticks. The serving for the main course is pretty generous. Both the rice and Kway Teow tasted good.

~this no reservation, "first to queue gets in" place is very popular with the lunch time crowd as it's in the financial district~while they also do small takeouts, they have a pre-order & pickup or delivery for a min of 30 sets of a set menu~they do not have a table order system as runners deliver and clear tables, so all ordering is done up front and prepaid at the cashier~best grab the colorful menus, a order chit and pencil your order while queuing for a table, that way you'll be ready when they're ready for you (make sure you pencil in the table number)~Chef Han's Hainanese Chicken Rice recipe from the old Chatterbox at Mandarin Hotel is served and our group had 5 sets of this super YUMMY dish, everything you get tastes exactly like what I remembered!  ~PappaMia Fried Kway Teow is delicious with the right amount of "wok hei" (charred heat) and great fresh towgay (bean sprouts) :)Always a good place for a quick meal with colleagues
