This unpretentious eatery has excellent South Indian food - especially their curries and Briyani rice.
I would rate this way ahead of the trumpeted big wigs as this is truly authentic - menu not modified for non Indian palates.

4 adults and 2 children went there for lunch after buying 2 coupons on Fave. The coupon condition clearly states that each coupon is for 2 adults only. We have no problem with that. HOWEVER, they insisted that each children MUST have a set meal. We cannot order A La Carte. Each set meal consists of just plain white rice and a few measly pieces of fried chicken. They charged us a ripped off price of $7.00 for each of these 2 meals. Due to Fave's lack of homework, this restaurant was allowed to rip us off. As this was insisted due to the use of the Fave coupons, it should have been clearly stated as a Condition on the Fave coupon - it was not. So be very, very careful when using Fave coupon, there may be hidden dangers like this lurking for the unsuspecting user. Also, I was incredibly thirsty after the meal, indicating very liberal use of MS

Bought the coupon online which include a curry fish head, 2 meat dishes - chicken, lamb and 2 vegetables. Other than curry fish head, the rest is like side dishes size. We cannot choose what kind of meat dishes as we came late in the evening. The curry gravy is nice. The rest tasted average to me

They serve all Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. But if you are expecting to have a brunch, better to find another place as there won't be anything left from breakfast to eat after 10am. It was open when i had dinner for many days after 10 pm. They have a good collection of Dosa (Those) in their menu. I tried Poori with their mutton curry and it was one of the best I had. They mistook me for an Indian so may times and tried to talk with me in Tamil and Hindi.:
