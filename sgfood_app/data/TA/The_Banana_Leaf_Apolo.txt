Always love the food here...a family favourite. The mutton mysore and tandoori chicken are our favourites. We also do online orders and they have always kept us happy@

I really do not know what is special in this restaurant worst vegetarian food we had in Singapore. Poor food and poor hygiene. Stinking wash rooms. Avoid this restaurant if u are vegetarian

Had lunch here today and it was fabulous. Great service, great beer and food was first class. Will return for sure before we leave.

We where a group of 15 people. They took advantage of the noise of the restaurant,send severals waiters to take the orders. And, after, they tripled the quantity. The amount of good they served us was tremendous even if I had say that we wanted a light and quick meal. One waiter even said to me “don’t worry, we will manage it!!!”. For us, it was very shocking to waste so much good food. In my point of view this is not a professional manner and clearly taking advantage of a chaos they created. so I will not recommend this restaurant for a group! I don’t mention the bill : we shall remember forever for a “quick and light meal !!

Well, if you are living under an average temperature of 80°F and eat really hot and spicy food such as Indian food at this restaurant, you bound to sweat like a water baby. Don't forget to order lime juice with lot of ice, it may help relieving the heat on your tongues for a few minutes (to me, it is more like nano seconds). But the taste is so delish, I cannot resist or stop eating. It is really good. Trust me..it's worth it. After all, you have travelled all the way to this food paradise, why not try it before you "mati"?

Had heard a lot about this venue, some mixed reviews. Thought we would check it out ourselves.Went there with the family. It was a quiet night, only about a quarter of the tables were occupied.The waiter was friendly & helpful but there was another man, who I can only assume was in charge of front of house, who was attempting to be friendly with regular conversations with us but we found this quite overbearing & intrusive. The food was average. The paper dosas were nice, the mutton, chicken curries & dahl were ok, nothing special. The vegetable curry was less than average.Not surprisingly, We didn't stay for dessert.I'd rate the food & cost as average & I'd rate the service as below average due to the regular intrusions (as I've described above)

We loved lunch at Apolo. From the super friendly and smiling person who opened the door to the waiters who treated us. The very tasty food and eating on the banana leaves gives a different feeling. Delicious curry chicken, fried rice with vegetables, lamb, naan delicious and all in a nice environment, clean, tidy. Get ready because although it does not have the spicy symbol on the menu, the food is generally spicy. But with a cold Tiger there are no problems. A place to indulge yourself to ea
4
I generally stay in Little India when in Singapore and always try and head to Banana Leaf Apolo in Serangoon Rd. They serve delicious Indian food in a casual atmosphere at a very reasonable price. One of the distinguishing features is the incredible range to choose from and it never disappoints.
5
I did go here because of my friend's recommendation. He used to treat his clients to Apolo when visiting SingaporeFor me the price is OK because they served a very big portion in every menu. So I went there with my husband and 1 kid. we ordered only 2 menus and it filled our tummy very wellThe must ordered menu is Naan, Fish head curry, apolo set lunch menuI highly recommended to everyone to try Indian Food hereThe most special thing is that they served the rice on the real banana leaf!!The sensation is REAL!! :) May be you will need a little time to be seated while you came in lunch timebecause the queue is very lon

My husband and I came to Singapore on our honeymoon earlier this year, and were craving some Indian food. We searched for a good place to go and this was one of the top, and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes are good and the food is not drowning in oil as with most Indian restaurants I've been too! I had a mango lassi which was very yummy, however there was a lot of it! The naans were cooked to perfection as were the curries!The only negative from me.. the seats were not the most comfortabl

Was dine-in on 8th dec at 6pm with my wife.visiting this place since yr 2000. Food is good and the taste maintain. Service crew standard needs to be buck up. Many new faces. Unfriendly staff member at cashier counter. Overall was fantastic. Tnx
5
On of the best tandoori chickens I ever had,accompanied by succulent gravy,Dahl was the name I think.Fast and professional service.
4
Nice Andhra and south meals
Delicious
Eat full stomach
Unlimited papad
2 varities of curries
Dal rasam sambar
All Authentic taste
5
That was definitely delicious, and I really appreciate for the man who taught us this restaurant.
If you aren’t a specialist of a specialist of Indian cuisine , I highly recommend that you go to there:)

A quick tip - if you're making reservations they will only take them till 12.30. After 12.30 you take your chances
5
The Banana Leaf Apolo in Little India has great food, great staff and great atmosphere. Of course if you go you must have Fish Head Curry - its Signature Dish! All of the dishes we tried were fantastic. It's a bit pricier than a lot of places in Little India (where you can eat very well for not very much), but paying a bit more for the atmosphere is well worth it. We ate well for $30 sing dollars a head. And the service was very fast
5
Basically came here to have the Singapore Famous Fish Head Curry and a recommendation by Mark Weins the famous food blogger on YouTube. I was actually told back in the 70's I ran out of this restaurant when I was a small kid by my mother as I couldn't get my head around having to eat on a real Banana leaf. Fast forward more than 40 years later I am back here with my own son who is 18 years old trying this massive snapper head out. I don't remember back then but all I can say is Mark Weins was right. The fish head curry is to die for. Its a beautiful dish to look at and I am so proud I took the challenge to eat it, as it was my first time having this dish despite it being arguably Singapore's national dish. All I can say is my family enjoyed the food here. Well worth to put Banana Leaf on a list to visit and try this dish out. Simply amazing
5
The South Indian Thali ( rice and assorted vegetables) was mind blowing. It wasnt too spicy or bland. The right proportion of spices was used and the flavors were amazing. The entire team and the Chef need to be appreciated for the attention for detail. I advice all vegans to visit this place for a treat to their taste buds
3
Went looking for a restaurant for our evening in Singapore and found The Banana Leaf. Departing guests recommended the food so we went in. The restaurant is large and obviously popular as there were a steady stream of customers. The service was efficient and reasonably prompt. Our meal was fair to reasonable in preparation and presentation but disappointing when compared to Indian restaurant fare we've sampled elsewhere. At $41.00 Singapore the cost is on a par with NZ restaurants
5
Visited Banana Leaf Apollo restaurant for lunch. Not to be confused with Banana Leaf Gayatri Restaurant nearby. Banana Leaf Apollo serves veg and non-veg food. We had veg food. The food has a south Indian taste, but quite good for all. The restaurant serves rice, dal and cabbage subji for about SNG 3.50. Additionally, many options are available in both veg and non-veg. The quality of food is good and can be categorized as comfort food
4
On of my friend refer this restaurant for lunch, restaurant is near to hotel were we stay, serivce and food is nice, for south India people who travel to Singapore didn’t missed this restaurant
5
The second time we have been here, beautiful Indian food served very quickly. This is not fine dining but the food is delicious. One of our favourites in Singapore.
4
good place to dine, nice cuisine and with a a good variety. Closes by 945 10 at night. worth eating once.
5
I visit Banana Leaf every time I come to Singapore. It is a little more expensive now and the menu has changed but the food is still great. Mutton masala, spinach paneer and tandoori chicken are my favourites.
I will return!
5
Perfect stop. Delivered more than expected and great value for money in very pleasant comfortable atmosphere
5
It's a great place if you miss or want to experience authentic southern Indian cuisine when in Singapore. Great variety of dishes, served on banana leaf. And it always tastes better with Kingfisher beer!
5
We loved this place! We found the place by accident, loved the food, and came back a few days later. Lots of dishes to choose from, all great quality. Lovely relaxed atmosphere, perfect for a family lunch.
4
We walked into this place on spec and were not disapointed. The menu and range of food on offer was extensive and I'm sure you will be able to find something you like.All the food is services on a banana leaf, hence the name :-)The service was very good and the quality of food we had was fab. If you only have a few days in town you will not be disappointed by this eating experience
5
The never ending crowds in the place is simple proof about the place! Had a sumptuous banana leaf dinner with the family complete with a few additional chicken and mutton dishes. Curries were fresh and really tasty, the meats were well cooked, and we left the place with a vow - when in Singapore, this is a must-visit
5
Very friendly staff made for a great lunch. Kids lived the idea of eating off banana leaves and loved the god they ate off it ! Had chicken tikka, kadhia chicken, fried rice, naan and daal which were all brilliant. Beer was very cold which was great for a Singapore lunch. Nothing to fault about this place. Our 8 yr old daughter asked afterwards if we could go back tomorrow !
4
Having visited here many times, I don't think this visit was as good as previously experienced.
Menu pictures for some dishes are unrealistic which resulted in us over ordering dishes.
Not a wholly professional service on this basis but fantastic food as always!
5
We came here as a family on holiday following a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. Great tandoori cuisine, fresh and delicious. Service was fast and efficient. Definitely recommend for non veg Indian food too!
4
Good to hv food there any time can choice yr item from almost everything they hv less table space but great service & nice arrangement.
5
I visited Little India to get my Indian culinary fix whilst in Singapore. I was disappointed to find the Tekka centre was under reservation (it had been recommended). My wife and I stumbled across The Banana Leaf and whilst we paid restaurant prices ($25pp) the food didn't disappoint.There was an extensive range of options. Our highlight was the 'Fish in Banana Leaf' for entree. One of the most flavoursome dishes I've had in Singapore
4
Was there for a small family celebration to send off our helper. You can really soak in the atmosphere of little India here ... makes you feel as if you were really in India. The food was also nice and the staff that served us, Mr Rahman, was very friendly and professional. Really enjoyed the food there
5
We came here for lunch and the food was delicious. A party of seven and none of us were disappointed with our food. Very good naan bread, delicious curry and reasonable price. Great eating from a banana leaf which our children in particular enjoyed. A good place to stop whilst visiting Little India
4
We had visited this place last year and liked the tasty mouth watering cuisine.Visited Banana Leaf again yesterday .There is no change at all.The decor,the ambience every thing is just the same as last year. The place is all strictly business,which is offering high quality North and South Indian cuisine to To it's customers.Out of all the dishes ordered Malabar chicken was disappointing.Other than that it still remains good place to eat North and South Indian food
4
We popped in here for dinner. We ordered a few starts and a curry and naan to share.The food came, to share on large banana leaves, it's a cool touch. The food tastes really nice and had an authentic feel to it and the restaurant. Would definitely recommend this place if your in little India.
1
The waiters are usually keen to serve the Caucasians than the Asians there. The menu were thrown on our tables and when the waiters kept ignoring us for at least 30 mins. The waiters were taking orders from other tables who had Caucasians in them. We then decided to leave and patronize another Indian restaurant nearby
5
We visited little India one afternoon and decided to have our dinner at one of the many restaurants. We enjoyed the veg samosa and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and Kashmiri rice. Food was very tasty! Staff friendly. We didn't make reservation but noticed that people were queuing shortly after we arrived! Would probably therefore recommend reservation unless you're happy to chance it and wait!
5
Great hotel with great Indian food, though there was heavy rush we still managed to get a table. The waiters also were very helpful.
5
Cannot complain with the service one bit the staff were great, food was amazing. Definitely go there if you are looking for good Indian food in Singapore!
5
Best indian food 🥘 in Singapore, came here twice in our stopover. Will be going back next year. Had a very spicy curry with a jug of beer!! And one glass 😊
4
Being a big fan of Indian food I would be a bit remiss to go here while in Singapore. Based in the little India part of Singapore the sounds and atmosphere are everywhere. The menu is quite extensive covering all regional cuisines in India. The kitchens are open and can be viewed by all. I thing I like in Indian restaurants. Food was very good really well spiced and tasty. As the name suggested instead of a plate you are given a banana leaf to eat from. It all adds to the vibe. Last thing. Don't expect subtle lighting and low music. It's all about the food. Delicious.
5
A clean Oasis in the middle of little Indian, Singapore. Great Indian food made to required spicy heat. Large selection of beers.Fish curry to die for as is the usual garlic naan, Bindi masala. Tahli is wonderful but need to dish out from the buffe section

I visited this restaurant 8 years ago when I was in Singapore.  This time I went with my wife for lunch. I had a chicken tikka masala with roti and my wife had lamb rogan josh with roti. Food was tasty though portions not too big. Rotis were small. We had a soft drink each. The bill came to just over $41. Overall, food was good but not well priced compared to some hawker type markets serving similar food. We were given popadoms once seated and we said we didn't want them. The waiter said 'ok', disappeared and returned with some condiments. In the end we gave up saying 'no' and pushed them to the side of the table. Service was a bit slow and it took a while to get somebody attention to get the bill and when we did it took them a long while to return.
4
My partner had visited it over 20 years ago & wanted to take me there, hoping it was still as good. It was very easy to find using Trip Advisor. We weren't sure what to do on arrival but quickly caught the eye of a helpful member of staff. It's a large place with plenty of tables available. It had a busy atmosphere with the vast majority of diners being locals. We received excellent service and loved the food. I'm vegetarian & had so much choice. Enjoyed eating on banana leaves & were given forks, spoons & hand wipes - (most diners eat with fingers). It had greatly changed from previously and certainly impressed us both. Will definitely return when next in Singapore
4
I stumbled upon this place and liked that you could see the kitchen and people cooking/working behind it. Ordered Chicken Dum Biryani and a cold Tiger been. Good food and they serve it on what looks like a banana leaf. Not sure if the banana leaf was real as it looked like it was recently washed
1
Food was delicious, but experience marred by 1. Poor service. We waited a long time for someone to take our order. When we asked one of the many waiters serving food, we were told that only the manager could take our order. Subsequently we saw the same waiters taking orders from other tables. When we asked the waiter serving our drinks for utensils, we were told that he only served drinks and that he'll get another chap to help us. 2. Hygiene. The eponymous banana leaves used as plates were dirty. Really dirty. Try using a wet wipe to wipe the leave. You will ask for a plate immediately.
3
We visited this Banana Leaf Apollo because of the rave about their fish head curry, specially Andrew Zimmern himself went to try the fish head curry.We ordered the chicken masala, prawn curry and of course the fish head curry, also the garlic nan (eating indian food without nan, is not complete isn't it?).Prawns come in large size, chicken masala comes in with half chicken without the wings, fish head curry we chose small size but still more than enough for all of us 3 adults.Rice is served over banana leaf (hence the name), comes with two vegetale dishes.All the food is good taste, real spicy for spicy food lover. The garlic nan is specially very good. One thing I found not so great is the fact the food is not cook to order, this downgraded or score.In general the foid is good but its worth nothing to rave about. Service is good enough
4
We had two nights eating at the Banana leaf and on both occasions the food was really good . Even me not liking spicy food found lots of dishes that I enjoyed.
5
Loved the food. Just the right amount of spice, hot but not killer!
The chicken masala and fish curry were excellent.
Friendly and attentive staff. Cold beer. What else could you want?
5
Ordered mutton briyani and almond naan. The taste was excellent and authentic.Best Indian food I had in Singapore for now.
4
The recommendation to dine here was spot on. The cuisine is delightful while the service is prompt and courteous.We dined on a selection of vegetarian and chicken dishes, all of which were unsurpassed with quality and flavour from any of our Indian experiences back home in Australia.Served on a banana leaf, the entire experience was filled with authenticity.Cannot recommend highly enough.Superb and very reasonably priced.
3
I found this restaurant to be average in terms of both service and the quality of food. Liked the idea of eating on a banana-leaf :) The restaurant itself was a welcome respite from the heat of the outdoors. Seems to be frequented by both tourists and locals, which is a good sign to me. Was disappointed that dosa's were only served 17h45 onward... I was ordering around 17h00 and was there until long after 18h00, especially after a lack of service after my meal was delivered to my table.
3
First of all let me say what a gem of a place, it is like a little oasis in little India. This restaurant is clearly a favourite of locals and this is good business for them. They could go on to make lots of money over the coming years and never look back and good on them if they do. However there is such an opportunity to cater to the tourists and make even more money. The food is delicious, the environment is great and unlike other restaurants in Singapore the alcohol is not expensive. Don't change what you do for the locals, just add a little bit of polish to your wait staff and get them to look after and communicate to tourists. This would have been a 5 star rating had it not been for the staff

I recently visited the Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant in Singapore, 54 Race Course Rd. I must say that I had an unpleasant experience. Firstly, we never could get a waiter as they showed no interest to attend to our table. Secondly, we were entitled to more than one serving of rice and curry however, the waiters never bothered to attend to our table and just avoided/ignored us. Thirdly, I asked for some serviettes to wipe my hands and the waiter never bothered to bring any (but I noticed others were given serviettes). I asked him for serviettes for the second time and then he rudely asked me to go inside and get tissues myself sounding like I’m a waiter. I had so much patience and this is when I raised my voice and used some harsh words too (this guy totally deserved it for his terrible attitude). He then started talking back to me (yelling) that I’m a foreigner and I don’t belong to Singapore and threw insults in front of all the guests and not respecting me at all as a customer.I must say that this particular waiter treated me as though I came here for free food. I noticed that he and the rest was treating the ‘white skinned people’ (with all due respect) very well. I felt that I was being discriminated since I’m Asian (fyi, these waiters were Asians too).Discrimination is totally unacceptable especially in the hospitality trade! In spite of all these, I had to settle a big bill! I’ll never recommend this place to anyone
5
We just had lunch at this place in Little India and we were wowed by the authentic flavour and value.Banana leaves were put on the table and it from these we ate the well flavoured biriyani and pakora. The price for each was less than $10 each. Highly recommended for Indian food lovers
5
Had a nice dinner at Banana leaf recently with son & BFF, Food was nice just a little too salty for the curry fishead. Chicken Masala was good. We always loved their side dish of cabbage vegetables, 2nd serving is a must, like the way it's done to very soft, and the squid, I love it
3
We went for dinner and the place was full but lucky enough we didn't have to wait long to be seated. We had to share table with other guests and the table arrangement is kind of a blend between restaurant and canteen. Foods were okay as I assumed those were already pre cooked. Prices are somewhat a bit too high compared to the quality expected.
3
Tried this place a few times with friends.
They used to be better especially the curry fish head.
Service also used to be better.
4
Food is good here to enjoy when you're in Little India. They serve it on clean banana leaf, freshly cooked food but staff is non-cooperative as they take too much time to serve & for re-order during course.
4
Went out on Chinese New Year day for lunch here. The fish head curry was very tasty (not too spicy) and the service was fast. No complaints here, very good. Get in early though as they get very busy.
3
Ordered Apolo Pepper CHK-S, Chicken Dum Biryani, Prawn Masala and 2 mango Lassi. Food was not that great specially Dum Biryani. But I paid around $50+ for 4 dishes. You can get better quality food with lower price near Mustafa Shopping Center.
3
For a Hotel of this type having no Bathroom (There is one public bathroom) across the street which is not clean was a big no-no for me. The food was reaonably good, but a little on spicy side.
4
Had lunch with a friend and we ordered curry fish headI expected a red snapper but we got a sea bassThe fish head was cooked wellThe curry was spicy and hotWe ate on the traditional banana leaf Service was good and politeWe drank coconuts A nice clean place
5
This place is very popular with locals. Meals are served on a banana leaf instead of a plate. You have to help yourself with knives and forks as most of the locals eat with their hands. I love the prawn mango curry, spicy but not too much and my son love their butter chicken which is not spicy at all. Their naans are simply delicious. To eat there is quite an experience. Always been there at lunch and during week days. I would not recommend going on a Friday night or weekends as Little India is very, very crowded then and this place as well
1
This is the worst restaurant we have even encountered. We came with my family for lunch. Restaurant was not crowded, but we waited for 15min and not a single waiters bothered to serve us, despite asking for menu a couple of times. We just got up and left. Very bad attitude, will not recommend even thou they have many awards. Such awards should come with prompt service.
4
A very very popular and extremely busy restaurant all dishes from northern India very different from what we are used to in the U.K. , nothing sweet , no papadums , the nan bread delicious ! Service good and clean , interesting watching the locals eat by hand ... I love sweet food and dessert ( desserts they don't have ) so not my cup of tea , however who am I to judge it was packed full and everyone loved it ... it's in little India so after eating take a stroll enjoy the local culture and traditions ... was I in Singapore ? Wow a real feeling of Indian hospitality ... not expensive give it a try .
5
went here for a family lunch, everyone ordered different things but all the food was fantastic and service was excellent. I had vegetarian dishes and they were all amazing. Love eating off the banana leaves as well. Would highly recommend to other travellers looking for excellent indian cusine
4
Great lunch spot after a morning of strolling through Little India.
Atmosphere was amazing with getting to eat off the banana leaf ! And the food is very tasty.
4
try fish head curry which is very popular there also you may enjoy other dishes and drink also but must try fish head curry
5
Fish head curry is a must have meal in Singapore and the one at Banana Leaf Apolo is superb.I knew from reviews and friends that I should eat there. Then when I quizzed the doorman at Raffles, he confirmed that I had chosen wisely.As per tradition, eat it with your fingers
5
I visit Banana Leaf Apollo on a monthly basis and most of the time I have vegetarian full course meal for $8.00. It comes with 3 types of vege, sambar (vege curry), rasam (hot spicy soup), yogurt (good for your gut) and dessert. The food is too much for one person actually so share it with your friend or family. I have also tried their fish head curry, naan and most of their non-veg food and the taste is consistent and is awesome! When in Serangoon road, this is my most frequented restaurant. The food is good and it gets crowded most times so can be overwhelming for the wait staff. However when it is not crowded, the wait staff can be abit switch off. Nevertheless, it is my favorite restaurant with all my comfort food under one roof so I will root for this restaurant all the time
4
We ate lunch here on Dec 23'16. The place is a typical informal Indian eatery but the food was awesome. Being Indians (visiting from San Francisco) we expected to see the place packed with Indians but were surprised to see many non-Indians enjoying the yummy food. In fact, I leaned across our table to inquire of our neighbors about they delicious looking items they were eating. That's how we found the Masala Chicken...seriously the best in Asia
2
The rating is actually terrible, but I added one more tick for the staff, because they were the saving grace. I made reservations for 35 pax and they put us in one of the dining halls. We had some extra guests, so they were seated outside the hall. The mutton was way too spicy, and this was a unanimous opinion. My guests left full plates of the mutton behind, and everyone had to have yoghurt at the end of the meal. The rest of the dishes were just average. The covering manager, Rajendran, had a terrible attitude. He actually told off one of my guests for standing in his way. When I confronted him about the way he was speaking to guests, he said I was mistaken and apologised for my misunderstanding of his attitude. Zero service mentality. No idea how he's a manager. The rest of the crew were amazing. Hard working, friendly. One of em apologised for the managers behaviour. Very positive despite the busy hour. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are many more better ones in the vicinity.
2
Had heard so many comments on this place that we decided to give it a try.We went there at 20:00 during the Diwali festival. restaurant was full and had to wait to get a seat and be served.Food was not fresh as it was heated and given to us.I would suggest the owner to revisit their food preparation before serving to customers
2
We wandered around Little India. The kids (17 & 11) refused to eat in the hawkers market in Little India, due to hygiene concerns. So wandered around a little further and found quiet a few restaurants along this strip. Don't know why we ventured into this one. Sad decor, even sadder wait staff. The food was beyond "blah". Keep away. If you want a decent India meal, try some of the other hawker stalls around Singapore
1
We visited this restaurant on our first night in Singapore having seen the positive reviews. It's turned me off Indian food for life after having severe abdominal pain for 2 days after eating here, my partner was also sick. Aside from the food poisoning the service was also bad- I requested no coriander in my dish and was served a meal full of it. The decor within the restaurant is quite ugly and one or two of the waiters looked utterly miserable. All for $45, save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere.
5
Fast, efficient service from pleasant, organised waiting on staff. It was very busy when we were there - often a good sign - but everything was very organised and calm. The food was promptly delivered, was good value and better quality than the prices might suggest
4
Food is cheap and excellent. You can see it of the number of local that go there. Plates are banana leaves and the spoon is your hands. Can be a bit spicy haha
4
Love this place. The curries are fantastic and the price is hard to beat. The only problem I had, was that I was really hungry and ended up having two main courses :D.
5
Had read about this place in lonely planet book and wasn't disappointed. Great service and great food.
4
This restaurant serves up very tasty Indian food. The service was very efficient, albeit a little abrupt. Meals were very generous and the place was absolutely packed to the rafters with diners. Would return.
5
Just like Mark Weins on Youtube describes this place. Amazing fish head curry and always busy during dinner. You MUST visit if you like spicy Indian food.
1
We went for a Sunday afternoon lunch. The restaurant was overcrowded hence the poor service was understandable,but the appearance and taste of the food was awful.The look of mint chutney with green food Colour or the orange food Colour in a veg tandoori platter was not pleasant .The taste/ flavour was no better.This place is completely avoidable
4
Large, impressive open plan restaurant, very fast and efficient service, especially given the restaurant was pretty full.. Food was not 'haute cuisine' but very acceptable (except for the prawns which were like rubber - maybe dried rather than fresh?). Price was 80 SGD for 2 including several drinks, and we left feeling full (and reasonably content)
5
One of our taxi drivers recommended that we go to The Banana Leaf Apolo in Little India for an authentic Indian meal. We followed his advice and had a fantastic meal. The staff were brilliant and the Maitre d made us feel right at home. We requested food that was not too hot and spicy and it was just that. A fantastic meal in a relaxed atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle if Little India
5
We have our team gathering here and had set up buffet dinner. I would rate the food here excellent especially their mutton Mysore, chicken and prawn masala. Affordable buffet spread for team of people. Good place to dine and furthermore near deepavali period. Will come agai
3
Good food in a restaurant conveniently located in Little India so I went here several times whilst working in Singapore. When accompanied by a male the service, although not friendly, was satisfactory but when with another female or heaven forbid on my own the service was extremely poor. The one time I was alone the service was non existent so I got up and left as I am sure was their wish. There are many other more pleasant places to dine in this area
4
Friendly service. Plenty of choice. Cool and comfortable. Very good vegetable thali. Served on banana leaves
4
We shared samosas, pakora, rogan josh, fish curry & naan and enjoyed beer and a reasonably priced bottle of wine. Friendly staff too.
4
We visited this place with our son. The food was delicious and the service was good. We shared a variety of dishes and enjoyed each one. Service was ok. Definitely recommend for a simple and enjoyable meal.
4
Tasty flood. We had lunch meals and fairly decent in taste, price and quality. Service is lagged little bit but ok. Cleanses is average.
3
If you compare in Singapore, this is really good. I order a mutton and banana leaf rice. All are ok to my standard but the mutton is too dry for me.
They could do better.
4
We went out to walk round Tekka market and soon became hungry. We saw The banana leaf and looked through the menu outside. It was about 8-30 pm and was reasonably busy. A waiter came outside and said the food is Yummy yummy trust me! So we did and he was right. Everybody else was eating with there hands and so we did. We had samosas to start and then two different curries with chapatis naans and jeera rice. The mango lassi was good too. There was only one other westerner in and the rest were Indian. It was 50 dollars Singapore for two which I thought was good value. I would definitely go bac
3
Good indian food. Famous for both North and South Indian cuisines. Fish head curry is their speciality. However the prices is too steep for locals. Mainly for tourist who is on a short layover in singapore and want to try the famous fish head curry etc
5
Been to Banana Leaf a few times and always have a lovely meal. It is not a fancy restaurant by any means, but the food is awesome. The best Indian food I have had in Singapore. Chicken Khadi in particular is lovely. Highly recommend if you are visiting Little India.

It was packed with every nationality known to man, with a buzz better than any Parisian bistro, and service to match. Big pots of bubbling curry on liberally dolloped spoonfuls of fragrant rice, freshly made naan and fresh lime juice with straws. There are few solitary tables, mainly long sociable ones, most of which contained the legendary fish head curry, which is what we will certainly have next time. What a stunning place, go tomorrow

What a find! This little restaurant was a welcome discovery when wandering through Little India. The food, which is served on a banana leaf is remarkable, fresh and if you want it, thunderously hot and spicy!My wife and I had some delicious curries, crab, chicken and mutton; all simply marvelously washed down with a cold Tiger!The atmosphere is great: busy and bubbling; with some local folk snickering when my wife washed some sweat beads off of my brow when enjoying the hot delights that this restaurant offers. If you go to Little India, I implore you to visit this restaurant - if you love Indian foods you will leave with a smile on your dial - we did
5
had a very friendly waiter serving us, the food were very fragrant. we ordered butter chicken, naan bread, some fried broccoli vegetables, curry squid and mutton! super delicious
5
Probably the best curry I have ever had.
The mint sauce is just soooo good
A must try in Singapore
Just be prepared to share a table - but so worth it
Enjoy
1
Simply have to call too many times in order for them to notice us. When was approached finally, not even a single apology. Screwed up service!!
5
The experience was Interesting to say the least. It was my first experience dining in a first class restaurant eating my meal from a banana leat. The restaurant is very clean and the food is delicious. I enjoy my meal and the ambiance
5
One of our favorite restaurants in Singapore! Great food and very fast service. Reasonable prices and nice staff.
2
This was a huge disappointment for us. We had dinner relatively early (5ish) and the restaurant was mostly empty. The area was somewhat air-conditioned. But many of the main dishes had been kept warm buffet-style for several hours, rather than being freshly prepared. Which is possibly the reason why my husband became sick. My dish had overcooked shrimp. The other main recollection is that bathroom, apparently shared with Tekka Food Center next door, was dirty--filty by Singapore standards
5
The smell of delicious Indian spices when you pass by this restaurant works like a magnet. Once inside you know why. Always very busy and that's a good sign. The real Indian food as the local Indian people like to eat. You have to go here..
4
I first tasted Gulab Jamun in New Bombay, an Indian restaurant in Manila. I liked it instantly that is why when i went to Singapore i lost no time looking for an Indian restaurant. The choice was Banana Leaf Apollo in Little India as we were billeted in Village Albert Court Hotel. Ordered the usual curries and all. But what I really like in Indian restaurants are the lassi and the gulab jamun. I believe that gulab jamun is one of the best desserts in the world. Everyone should try it when dining in an Indian restaurant
3
I had high expectations for this place given the reviews. We ordered lots of food and it was just ok. Nothing special or better than Indian food that you can get in Australia. Was quite disappointed and also felt it was quite pricey when compared to other places in Singapore. Think there are much better places to eat at in Singapore
4
Banana Leaf is a restaurant which has acquired a must eat/visit place reputation for visitors to Singapore.Located in Little India Complex on Sarangagoon Road it offers Cuisine of South India .After having the food there , we tend to agree that the reputation is well deserved .The food IS delicious , tasty ,just rightly spicy and to please ever palate .Meals are served on banana leaves . Service on Banana leaves emphasises its name as well as South Indian Cuisine.Ambiance is average . They have tried to give it Indian looks by giving names like Delhi Hall, Tanjjore , Trichy Hall etc but failed miserably in their efforts to give Indian looks..Place also offers Hard and soft drinks.The food makes up for all those failures. It really is good
4
The food here is excellent and well priced. The staff were really helpful, advising us on appropriate choices. Such good value.
4
The restaurant is busy, filled with locals as well as tourists. There were large families and couples. The ethnic mix was Indians, Chinese and Westerners. They have a large menu with a variety of tasty choices.
3
It's since long we were planning had nice filter coffee with the coffee touch.Noon was made moody with coffee
5
Food is good. Service not so much. Price is average. But the freshness of food and authenticity of tastes makes it really worth your dime. I had yellow daal, roti, white rice and vegetables
4
Delicious indian food, nice staff, chicken butter, mutton mysore, garlic naan are good, butter naan also good, reasonable price
5
nice Indian food my wife enjoyed the food because she is indian ..../but for a person like me have an allergy to chilli food i spent all the night in the toilet
5
My boyfriend and I both ate here during out stop through little India and it was great! I had the butter chicken which I think it was the best I ever had and my boyfriend had the chili chicken which was also very good. Very popular place, got very busy after we sat down. Service wasn't that fast but it was still an enjoyable meal. Highly recommend
5
If you are looking for a fantastic Indian meal at low cost this is the place to go We each chose different meals so as to experience many tastes ( sharing ) The meals come to you on Banana leaves , and are moth watering Indian style You choose you meal individually from the bay marine ......absolutely a must for people who like Indian food and cultur
5
This is always my go-to for Indian food if I want to indulge without the crowd of the hawker center opposite. 3 adults can share a dum bryani comfortably. Go for the creamy chicken tikka masala, paneer mekani, aloo gobi for a lip smacking lunch without a carbo overload. Papadums come free. With drinks, the damage is about $50. Comes with service but no charge for it. Servers are efficient but not very personal. They don't warn you if you order too much. But that could be just me
4
Welcomed with big smile by maitre de at door and shown to table. Once choice of India food ordered a banana leaf was placed in front of us and this was to be what we ate from. A totally differen t experience for us westerners but highly enjoyable. Food was good, decor excellent and very clean. Pricey for what you got but worth the chance to try a different cultural way of eatin
3
Good but expensive, I ate in traditional, proper Indian restaurants and it is not that expensive even if it is in Singapore.
So no, I won't come back there again.
4
Enjoyed eating tasty south Indian food off the banana leaf with my fingers! Easy to find and definitely a must-go when visiting little India in Singapore.
4
Stumbled across this place when I was in Singapore on business. I wish half the places I eat in when away with work were half as good as this place. Lovely fresh tasty ingredients and a relaxed atmosphere with friendly efficient staff.
4
Good location, easy to find. Comfy space. Delicious Indian Food with reasonable prices. This is best Indian food in Singapore.
4
A very low key place with good Indian food. Quite diverse menu. Banana leaves as plates are a nice touch. Kids also enjoyed the food (though they are not particularly fan of Indian food)
4
Singapore's best fish head curry. The place is actually clean specially their bathroom. You will get 2 sides for free (cabbage and eggplant) and unlimited white or yellow rice.
5
A fantastic Indian restaurant in Little India. They offer a wide variety of food (heaps of veggie options) and it is all very reasonably priced. Some of the best Indian we have ever had.
5
After asking around for a good fish head curry place, some of the locals such as taxi drivers and shop keepers recommended the Banana Leaf Apolo. We went there for dinner around 7pm on our last day in Singapore. The place was crowded but we got a table fairly quickly. We ordered a large fish head curry, biryani rice, and a roti prata. The biryani rice was average. The roti prata was good. The fish head curry was excellent. The fish was firm and the curry was so flavorful but not over powering. The service was fast. Oh, the mango lassi was very good as well. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Singapore
2
Poor service (asked for more ice for drink 4 times and I'm still waiting!), cold naan bread, 'hot' mutton vindaloo not even medium strength and very bland, very average chicken tikka and stodgy samosas. Only saving grace was the pakoras which were half-decent.Quite expensive too. Best avoided, u can do a lot better in little Nadia for a lot less..
3
I always enjoy Indian food and must say this is one of the best! The food was tasty but disappointed with the Teh Tarai cause it was served warm instead of hot. It must have been at the drink counter for very Long and no one pick it up. The service was really slow 
4
This place is an institution. Food is tasty, prices moderate and some of the staff are a real riot making jokes and bigging the place up. We ate very well for about SGD 25 each.
5
Four of us ate here on business trip to Singapore. Was recommended by batman at marina bay. Didn't disappoint, food was fantastic, great variety, v v tasty and not a long wait. Was a Sunday night and busy enough but would go back for sure
4
The food was excellent and the service quick and curtious. Servers came around with a big bowl of rice and placed some on each plate right before the mains arrived... The madras was really good, we will be back.
4
Busy restaurant, frequented by locals and tourists alike. We found the food very good, you do actually eat off a banana leaf, but it took us a long time to be served after being seated. Staff helpful and polite once they got going. Good value for Singapore.Restaurant is a bit of a strange design with large pillars blocking views of the open kitchen etc
3
Thought we would try it as we were in Little India.We have a lot of Indian restaurants in the UK and it compared well with them.Eating off the banana leaf is novel to us and the pompadoms were the best I ever had.The food was delicious but the cockroach in the ladies toilets didn't go down well with the 3 ladies in the family group
4
As an English couple, we found familiar dishes on the menu, served up on banana leaves instead of plates. The food was of good quality and far better than the vast majority of curry houses back home.I would recommend as a safe bet for experiencing Indian food in Singapore
5
Noticed this on trip advisor and as it was near hotel thought we would give it a try. The food was very tasty and the price reasonable for Singapore. Liked the authentic eating with fingers and the plate substituted by a banana leaf. Well worth a visi
4
Food tasted delicious and the atmosphere was good. We got the food after waiting awhile. The service was the only reason why this restaurant didnt reach up to 5/5. There was too many people serving us, would appreciate if there was only one. Would recommend though
2
First time I've ever been to a restaurant and been entertained by staff arguing and abusing each other. Hilarious! This restaurant was very busy, noisy and full of tourists. They actually moved the couple sitting next to us while they were eating their meal! Anyhow the food was very ordinary and the service perfunctory. The food may be authentic, but there are plenty of better curry eateries in Little India
5
We went with a bunch of friends to this famous outlet. The food is great and the price super reasonable in terms of Singapore standards. You may have to queue if you have a bigger group unless you reserve in advance. Do try the spicy fish and make sure you have your coconut water ordered to simmer down the fire. But worth it
5
Excellent curry, just managed to get a table before place was full. Food was great - would recommend anyone to visit and experience this restaurant
3
Busy restaurant in the heart of Little India. Generally need to wait for tables, service is rather poor and food is average when compared to similar restaurants in the area.
Advice to management would be get more efficient waiters and improve service for repeat business.
3
The Banana Leaf Apolo offers a wide selection of Indian food and snacks. The place is a value for money but the service is lax.
5
What can I say about this place? It's a very good Idian restaurant with an efficient service and quite cheap prices (around 20â‚¬ per person if you eat a lot).Everything was good and nothing was too spicy.The restaurant itself probably isn't the fanciest place ever but that's not what one looks for when he / she goes to an Indian restaurant.Note that this place used to serve everything in banana leaves and without a plate. Now they've added the plate and they've kept the banana leaf between the plate and the food... I let you decide which version you prefer
4
I am not a huge fan of Indian Food but My wife is and our Friends highly recommended the Banana Leaf in Little India.This place is very busy and loud but the food is excellent.Like many have already stated the service is quite abrasive so don't expect any big smiles here ! The famous fish head curry was nice but I expected something stunning based on reputation.The Chicken Tikka marsala and lamb rogan josh are very good as is the biryani.All of the above plus three beers came to $90 so not as cheap and cheerful as I was expecting but good nevertheless
3
I went there because a friend of mine suggested I go here for the fish head curry. so we did end up going here though felt I made a mistake. one of the reasons is cause i live in Dubai where one is spoilt for choices when it comes to restaurants and the amount that I paid for a meal in this restaurant I would get to eat for the same price in a 5 star restaurant here. most people go here for the experience of eating food on a banana leaf which to me being indian is no big deal at all. the food I would say is ok, service decent but price way over the top. We were even charged for the wet wipes which are used to wipe your hands after the meal....would certainly skp this the next time I am in Singapor
2
We got to the leaf about 10 after they opened and when we got there they were still bringing in the food and it was just a little awkward. So we enter the restaurant after asking if they were open and awkwardly stood waiting until finally the guy told us where to sit. We then sat for probably a half hour waiting while everyone went out of their way to avoid eye contact with us. Finally I got the one girl busing the tables attention then she grab another guy who finally took our order. While waiting we realized there was a wedding and that's why they were ignoring us. It was just very frustrating to see us being put second when we were there first. After ordering our food did come out fast but it wasn't anything that we could get back at home. It was good but nothing out of the ordinary.
5
This was my second visit to Banana Leaf Apollo and I enjoyed it just as much as I did on my first visit. This time I visited at lunch time with my adult daughter.We were warmly welcomed at the door and led to a table. A basket of Pappadums arrived immediately and we were each given a menu, a banana leaf and a moist towelette.We ordered one serving of chicken korma, one of butter chicken, a serve of saffron rice, garlic naan, a mango lassi and a peach lassi. We found this amount of food to be perfect for two women with average appetites.We placed the food on the banana leaf and mixed it together. Although we began eating with our fingers, after a while we changed to fork and spoon as we found this easier. We noticed that many other customers were doing the same.We're not used to spicy food so we chose items from the menu which we felt would not be too spicy for us. The chicken korma was milder than the butter chicken but both were perfect for our level of spice tolerance.The rice and naan bread were nice and the lassis were outstanding.Service was efficient and the food arrived piping hot and very quickly.The total bill came to $46.80. I will definitely visit again when next in Singapore.
4
By my standards this was pretty authentic food. I travel to India quite a bit and this was very familiar to food you'd find there. The layout is long public bench style, so very easily have strangers sitting very close to you. The servers bring you several vegetarian mixtures after you order, as well as serve you rice. Little bizarre, but it works. The food was good, had good flavor and was a great spot for some indian food.
4
We had a look at the restaurant from outside and saw it was full of local people. We knew it was going to be good. The food is served on large pieces of banana leaf. The curry was tasty but not too hot and over powering. The tandoori chicken was incredible. It was a shame we didn't have time to eat there again. This is not your usual British-Indian food....this is proper
4
A nice and Good restaurant. Its spacious and not crammed. the seating is spacious and you get your privacy.
only Ysday i felt the Rice was overcooked and can be taken care in future.
4
We met some tourists who recommended this place. We had chicken masala and curry.very very spicy, but a nice experience. Clean good service. Parallel to the shopping road, but taxis were difficult to stop.
Worth the effort to go there.
4
A little bit off the tourist tracks but well worth a visit. Not a fancy place but serves delicious food on banana leaves.
4
A nice quaint place for some quick indian grub, cheap and hygienic. there may be better options but you can never have enough of indian food anywats
5
This busy restaurant in Little India in Singapore is definitely on the tourist trail, as the steady stream of European dinerâ€™s shows, but the majority in the large, busy, closely packed dining room were locals of all ethnicities. You sit at long tables close by other other diners and it is noisy and very lively. The menu has two sections South Indian and North Indian neither with a huge range, which I always consider a good sign. The service is prompt and efficient but certainly informal. The staples - rice, relishes etc. are brought to your table in bulk in steel buckets and dished out in very generous quantities and then your particular order is brought separately. It is high turnover, unsophisticated dining, but excellent, authentic Indian food in a very lively ambiance, very good value and an experience. Not for the romantic candlelit dinner
5
don't be put off by the looks of the restaurant - this is a proper gem! i can probably count on one hand the amount of times i have had curry for lunch on a monday but it is testament to the quality of this place that the food was excellent even then. very authentic flavours, great menu choices and service perfect. i can't recommend this place highly enough. the main courses were excellent and the chana, dhal and naan were really good. if you are in little india, you have got to give this place a go
5
Amazing food. Stopped here because it looked busy and people were happy. It was seriously the best indian ive eaten - had butter chicken, prawn briyani and butter naan. $32 sgd great value and was very full. Must go backFriendly staffGreat valueVery cleanYumm
3
This restaurant was recommended on google so I decided to give it a try. I had a teh tarik (pulled milk tea), banana leaf with biryani rice, chicken masala, chicken curry sauce, two vegetables, and papadum. It was decent.The restaurant itself is clean, service could be improved. There are probably better places to have Indian food around that area.Nonetheless, I was satisfied I got to have some Indian food before I left
4
If you are a South Indian living or visiting in Singapore and you are missing your comfort food - this is where you will find all your comfort. Restaurant is known for its Fish Head which in smallest portion is also too huge - they even have a record of selling maximum no of this dish.To me, it was like eating in a Udupi restaurant in India - being a vegetarian myself.
3
Went along on a recommendation, it was packed but was able to get a table pretty quickly.The guy who took the order was abrupt but I put that down to a little arrogance due to the name it has, food must be good ! I had butter chicken which was good, tandoori chicken was not the best, didn't taste like it had been in a tandoor Oven ! Others in the party were happy.Restaurant lacked a bit of ambience but at the same time was buzzing ! Would I go again ! Probably not ...
5
The food was awesome! I loved every bit of it, we had chicken briyani, mutton briyani, prawn masala and fish cutlet. the prawn masala was exceptionally good. i will definitely visit this place again.
3
Despite the restaurant being packed we were able to get a table within 5 minutes and surprisingly the service was exceptionally good for such a busy restaurant. The food however was below average and did not taste anything close to a proper curry.
4
Me and my family of 5 visited this restaurant and we all enjoy it very much. Nice flavors and we laughed a lot while we ate with our hands!
Great fun!
4
My all time fav! Generous portion of rice and vegs, yummy fish head, price is a bit steep, used to be cheaper. Must try!
4
My wife and I were at The Verge in Little India picking up decorations for our home. We decided to lunch in the area. The hospitality and seating was immediate and friendly. The menu was huge with most North and South Indian dishes that we could think of and more. My wife decided on the vegetarian set while I chose the Dum briyani with chicken. The food came within 5 minutes. The presentation and layout was authentically South Indian, including banana lead instead of a plate. There must have been 8 items in the vegetarian set including a fresh Chapati. It was a huge meal. The Dum briyani was equally large and came in a steel pot. The fragrance was intoxicating with tastes to match. The spices were balanced and provided for a delicious meal. Our drinks, masala tea and iced coffee, were also enjoyable. It costed SGD27.40 for both of us but we felt it was good value for the quality and comfort of a spacious air-conditioned restaurant. We'll definitely be back soon, perhaps with the entire family
5
An absolutely amazing restaurant! The meal portions are generous, and reasonably priced. Eating on the banana leafs just adds to the experience, the restaurant is very clean and the wait staff were very friendly. Try the biryani and chicken dishes, they also have fresh coconuts. Definitely a must try
4
Regular fix of their 'MUST' eat chicken masala whenever we are down visiting Singapore. I must say till today we can't any good substitute restaurant that can serve the heavenly taste of chicken masala thickly coated with extremely rich spicy sauce. Even my fussy wife eater was won over by the first bite and thereon clean out two big biryani rice servings during our lunch outing there recently. The fish head curry is another well recommended dish in this restaurant. We were promptly served by the restaurant crew and overall a good eating experience
4
Went with some trepidation due to poor recent reviews, but glad we did. Place was packed and noisy (8pm on a Friday), but we were seated quickly. Drinks delivered immediately, food arrived within 7 to 8 minutes, as promised. The Sizzling Tandoor was exactly as ordered - good selection of meat and fish, reasonably spicy, bubbling away volcanically on a cast iron skillet. Further beers ordered and delivered promptly (waiters use tablets to transmit orders to bar and kitchen). Fine dining this isn't, but if you're looking for an authentic food experience, this ticks a lot of boxes. Travel tip - only 100 metres from Little India MTR station
1
Decided to try out this restaurant on our trip to Little India . I think this was the worst mistake we ever did . Pathetic service .No one is bothered . The food takes about 20 minutes to arrive . My paneer makhani was not great . Our rumali roti took exactly half n hr to arrive . The sweet lime soda was average . Please please avoid this restaurant !!!
4
like their black dal aka dal-makhni and kashmiri pulao.. didn't like their chutney's in dosa/idly.. as they wont discard the garlic skin.. it irritates when you get a piece of garlic skin in your mouth.. same goes in their veg biryani.. you will get a garlic skin.. their service is bad.. they wont give you spoon and fork unless you ask them and also they wont serve biryani with lemon and onions unless you ask them.. some time they bring almost after you finish eating
4
Food is fresh and tasty. Service could be better not because of the waiters but because they are shorthanded.
5
I hosted a business meeting at the Banana Leaf. The food was awesome, and the service was very attentive and professional. I will definitely visit again!
5
This restaurant is located in little India in Singapore. Easily accessible with the MRT. Delicious and well priced. Servers are friendly and brought our food in a timely manner. Would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic Indian food.
5
I would love to recommend this restaurant in Singapore. Me and my wife visit singapore for my holiday and had found a nice restaurant with a very yummy food .
3
Has Options of Alcarte & set meals also.
I had south Indian meal and mango lassi
Set meals are value for money.
Service is good
4
My son treated me to Banana Leaf Apolo on 22 Nov 2015. Food is good, ambience is fair but the service was slow due to lack of staff. On that day there was also a birthday party going on and it was very noisy with lots of screaming and shouting. If not for the food I may reconsider going there again coz the service is not to standard. The waiters are polite and friendly only thing the management does not have enough waiters in this outlet
4
Have now eaten here on 4-5 occasions and suggested we did so again when visiting relatives. The festival was on so the whole area was busy and colorful.Once again we had a good quality meal even if the service was a bit slow and they forgot one of our orders!Has a unique atmosphere which we all enjoy and is always busy which is testament to the food. 
3
Food is cheap and okay. I am a vegetarian so there was quite a choice. The atmosphere was more or less okay. No great expectations. Service was quite slow. We waited a while to be seated and no welcome when arrived. But if you are looking for something filling and not that much expensive, then in Little India, this is a good place to eat
4
First impression of this place was waiting to get a seat! Quick glance at the people eating sealed the choice as it was full of foreign nationals (minus asians). food quantity and quality was good. Special mention to be given to Mango lassi which was wonderful
4
As a massive curry fan i couldnt wait to get to Little India in Singapore. We were going to eat in one of the food halls when i spotted this delight. It is very basic inside, old wooden tables and chairs in a large dining hall. The food prep area and counters are along the back wall and the chap who shows you to your table is well.........different!However the fun starts when you order your curry (decent enough range to suit all tastes). Your plate is a large banana leaf, no crockery here!The curry was served promptly and was delicious, authentic and plentiful. You can eat traditionally with your fingers if you want, or like me use a knife and fork.It was clean and tidy and i didnt worry about the hygiene standards, although my wife said visiting the loo was an experience as you had to take a ticket, wander down an alleyway and use a toilet that doesnt belong to the restaurant!All in all for 2 x curry dishes, 2 x nan breads, 1 x pilau rice and 2 x cokes to wash it down the bill came to about $40 which is just shy of Â£20.Would i go again? Yup no hesitation
4
We chose this restaurant, as it had been recommended by my friend's Indian colleagues. Food was excellent, incredibly tasty and much more flavoursome than Indian restaurants back home.
Service very friendly, food arrived quickly.
5
Friendly informative staff and one of the best meals I had in Singapore and also maybe the best Indian food I have had in a long time. I cant wait to go back and visit this restaurant again and bring my husband and kids.
4
No visit is completed if one does to visit this South Indian restaurant in Little India... Great selection of authentic dishes to try from, especially their favourite Fish Head Curry & many more..
3
Ordered North Indian foot and not too impressed. Food quality was just ok. Service was good and when we complained about a naan they did give a replacement naan at no charge
5
One of our favourite restaurants, well worth the trip to Little India (easily accessed on the MRT). The food is divine and all eaten off a banana leaf, staff are friendly especially the lovely man on the door (he recognises us on each visit even though they can be 2 years apart!) Prices are very reasonable for Singapore and the atmosphere and the fragrant smells of Little India markets all add to a must visit in Singapore
4
I held my mother's 60th Bday party here. We booked a VIP room for about 25 guests. I liked the privacy our guests could enjoy. The service was good, the waiter came to check several times if everything was in order and if we needed help. The food was good, especially the chicken and mutton. The room and the restuarant could use a little bit of refurbishment. The walls and furniture were looking really tired. We paid 150 SGD just to use the VIP room and didnt think that the room was worth the price. The wall paper was really old and the room looked really dull. However, the food made up for it. In all, a pleasent experience
5
Went to Little India, Singapore. We wanted to try the local curry, and were recommended this by a local.The meal came in dishes with a banana leaf for a plate. I had a chicken Kadhai which was superb. I like a hot curry, but though it was not a hot one, the taste of the different spices shone out. We were a group of six, with six different meals which were all good
5
We were working around to have dinner when we were rejected by the one before we csme across this place...we were welcomed with a real friendly way and given a table without any problems...the food here is just sensational they got such a grt variety that you wont be disappointed we had a few dishes they all tasted grt just mouth watering with taste XXXXX... for the price we paid it is very cheap...NOT EXPENSIVE. Will be back here for sure on our next visit
3
The food here is good; mild or hot, meat or vegetarian, adults or children something for every one. Add in the novelty of a banana leaf instead of a plate. The service was a bit hit and miss, sometimes attentive other times we were ignored. The downside - the toilets. Not a good place especially when children need the facilities! Rather smelly and dirty, to be avoided. Such a shame when Singapore is re-known for its cleanliness. Please improve if you want our custom again
5
A great experience.. Taken out by a local Indian couple. We let them ordered and it was a great experience. Accept that it was very busy (Sunday lunch) and service needed some reminding but that is part of the experience.The mutton biryani was amazing and the Palak Paneer was also brilliant.This is a great tasted of India and the experience is worth it. Also try the tandoori chicken was brilliant.Our second time there and many more times we hope
3
...because they aren't going to ask you if you want a refill, or come check on you at all while you eat. Bad service- maybe the worst I have had. But hey, the food was delicious and reasonably priced.
5
Found this restaurant while looking for a different one and glad we did. The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly! Definitely some of the best Indian food I have ever had.
3
The place has no spirit, it's llike a big canteen but the food is good. Ideal for families or big bunch of friends. Not expensive.
5
Amazing service + outstanding food = perfect restaurant
Some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted!
4
We tried this restaurant as it came recommended from a friend. They cater to westerners which can be a great thing or an okay thing. We personally like to experience very authentic food instead of the westernised versions so we weren't blown away. The flavours were good for sure but we have actually had better Indian in Canada which we were surprised by. Worth a go but if you really really know your Indian curries maybe try to seek out a hit more of a hidden gem.
4
If you ask a taxi driver they will always take you to the banana leaf Apolo on racecourse road which is more tourist foreigner location. So of you want SERANGOON road one then say that specially but refer them to HASTINGS ROAD which is first right as soon as you enter Serangoon Rd. The food. Was delicious. Arrived 30mins before closing time. Ordered two dishes. Arrived quite quick. Service is average as expected but like any resturant I'm little India we come for the food and not service. Reasonably priced. Cheaper than Orchard but priced higher for little India standards. Since the food was tasty I am happy. Not easy location to arrive at and depart so maybe next time I find a place to eat on racecourse road.  they have an entrance through little India arcade from Serangoon Rd but a taxi can easily drop you at these Hastings Rd entrance.
1
We had to ask several times for them to take our orders. In fact, they never gave us a menu. They practically ignored us for 10 minutes before we got up to leave. Horrible service. The people are just there to work and you wonder with such attitude, what type of food will they be serving if they couldn't care less about the customers.
4
My sister and I enjoyed our lunch at Banana Leaf Apolo. It was nice to sit in pleasant surroundings with effective air conditioning after suffering the heat on the streets of Little India.The waiter was quick to seat us and bring our menus. We ordered two servings of chicken korma, a saffron rice to share, plain naan bread to share and raita. Papadoms were provided as complimentary. My sister ordered a Tiger beer and I ordered a Mango Lassi.We were each provided with a banana leaf, which looked like a placemat, and the waiter served our rice from a big container directly onto the leaf. We then spooned the chicken korma a bit at a time onto the leaf and mixed it with the rice, using either our fingers (complimentary wet wipes provided), or a fork or spoon to eat it. We learnt how to do it by watching and asking an Indian lady seated nearby. There were actually a lot of Indian people eating in the restaurant.We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and it came to S$50.00. I've been told that you can find a cheaper meal in Little India, however we considered it a fair price for comfortable surroundings and what we considered to be good quality food. We would definitely visit again.

Although banana leaf Apollo is famous for its fish head curry, I being a vegetarian cannot provide an effective review of the non veg cuisine. I visited the place with family few days ago after many years. I was amazed by the menu in offer. The masala dosa , rava masala as well as Idlis were very tasty. The Apollo lime juice was quite good. The best was their coffee. It was quite creamy and left the taste lingering in your mouth for long. They should however improve their service as the waiters take long to take orders.

We went there with some friends and tasted several dishes : Dosai, Vegetarian Masala, Briyani... Everything was very good. I really likes the dosai and the vegetable masala (Aloo Gobi Matar / Potato Cauliflower and Peas). Some dishes were a bit too spicy, but this is to be expected when eating indian food. This place is part of he historic little india quarter in Singapore. Unfortunately when we went and maybe because it was late, it was very empty a nicer atmosphere. Yet the service was very nice and fast.

This tucked away Indian restaurant is a cracker serving top food at inexpensive prices. The place was packed and the atmostphere good and they served ice cold beer at a fraction of what it costs in the tourist areas
5
This is really a place to visit when in Singapore if you fancy Indian Food. Great taste, originally taste wonderful dishes. Good selection of both Vegie and meat dishes.
4
Had a late dinner ordered chicken masala,fish cutlet and 2 naan. Chicken masala was good so was the Nan.Fish cutlet was ok not great.Jug of beer was 25.00.Service was not bad could be better.Would go back to try some other dishes the next time around.
4
Staffs are friendly and I took a cab here and taxi driver ask not to give him a fifty dollars note, ask me to exchange somewhere! I went into this restaurant cashier was good to do that for me! Variety of food! Naan must eat especially garlic naan! My colleague ordered all I don't remember all their exact name but I remember there's a cheese curry it's so good. All others can be spicier I feel, chicken, fish and vegetable curry. Indian food are always slightly pricey, but that's okay
5
The Banana Leaf Apolo offers a large variety of dishes both veg and non veg. All dishes that we have tried tasted superb. The difference between a restaurant like this and the cheaper versions is that although the cheaper restaurants are nice enough, the taste could be considered somewhat crude compared to how the dishes at this restaurant are prepared, i.e. more refined in taste. We had mutton briyani, naan, chicken tikka massala, fish curry, fish cutlets and several other dishes. The staff is friendly. Only thing is that it requires patience if you dine here in the evening, when the place is really crowded.
4
While the atmosphere is not really the suggestive one may expect from an Indian restaurant, the service and the food are excellent. Eating on a leaf of banana and being allowed to eat with the hands (fork and knife are provided if the guest prefers the Occidental way) is also an added are new (and welcome) experiences. Good advices on spicy/non spicy dishes, everybody enjoyed the food and the evening
4
We went twice during our 10 day visit to Singapore . Good service , good food with original authentic flavours . You don't get a plate , your plate is a banana leaf . There are no toilets however . You have to go to the public conveniences in the arcade opposite picking up a little voucher so you don't pay . Not the best of toilets . For emergencies only ! The lamb curry I had on both occasions was incredible with pieces of coconut and fresh spices and vegetables . There is an altar as you come in with garlands and candles which is interesting to see 
5
My sister lives in Singapore and has a book on 100 things to do while in Singapore - eating at this restaurant is one of them! We went there for lunch one day, the restaurant wasn't packed but quite busy. You can choose what to have from the a la carte menu. Alternatively they have other foods on display to choose from. We chose from the menu and had chicken tikka (possibly the best chicken tikka I've ever had), another couple of chicken dishes, nann bread, rice and dahl. The service was excellent and we will be going back ;-)

Located literally few minutes away from little India mrt. There are few more other restaurants around. But they all cater Indian cuisine.Most of the tables have ipads fixed. It has an app shows the menu and has options to call a waiter, ask for the bill or even to place the order. But unfortunately it doesn't work. It's just for a fancy show. Waiters were prompt. Waiters took their order over a device not paper.Drinks did not taste as much we expected but blimey the food was very delicious. Food were served on a banana leaf. Was bit hot but too yummy. I have never had any Indian like this before.Prices are average for Singapore I reckon. Would definitely visit here again n if you are a fan of Indian cuisine you should definitely try this place out
5
Don't let the name turn you off. This is a must see. Even if you only go for a cup of tea. No plates, just a large banana leaf on the table. No silverware. Fingers only. When they say a dish is spicy, they mean spivey for a local. That means nuclear for a westerner. They do have mild dishes as well. You'll be talking about this place for years to come
1
Terrible place to eat. Would avoid. Rip you off, charge for napkins and table water left there.
Order a okra curry, more onions than okra. Reluctantly replaced by the rude staff
4
Tasty and vibrant atmosphere, good friendly service. Have been a couple of times and recommend to eat there.
1
Please dont visit this place ever...we are vegetarian,food was ok types ...staff was very rude....not interested in serving ..they are interested in money only..even they think they are obliging customers by serving average food.i had very bitter experience.please dont spoil ur mood & taste.
4
We went to the Banana Leaf for lunch. The restaurant was very clean; the service was quick and professional. The menu range was good and has both North and South Indian dishes. The food is served on a Banana Leaf and I recommend getting some Naan and then tucking into your food using your fingers
4
Went to this place with my family after my sister's baptism ceremony. Quite a different variety of dishes and most of them were authentic in taste. The place was not very crowded, given that it was a Sunday. If you are planning to go here as a large group I would i recommend that you make a reservation.
2
Restaurant is very clean. Located near the mrt and bus stop. However , the food was very subpar and there wasn't much indian taste in it . The service was bad as well as they did not take not of our requests such as no ice in our drinks . The ambience was not really good
4
Pretty good Indian food (Little India in Singapore has the best Indian food outside of India).We ordered the Tandoori mixed plater, Rogan Josh, Dal Makhani and some nan.The food was good, but the tandoori plate wasn't sizzling (Like they do at Delhi on race course road (that's the benchmark)
3
The banana leaf rice expert will not likely enjoy Apolos. I had the biryani rice and chicken korma as the base to my banana leaf fish. The vegetable DNS accompanying dishes were not generous. Having. Said that, the tastes and flavours were all good, and I ate the lot
4
Firstly we were greeted at the door by the maÃ®tre de he is a massive asset to the restaurant very friendly polite and obliging gentleman. The restaurant is a bit like an old food court but clean. The food was delicious.Don't expect plates as there name States banana leaf. So you are presented with a piece of leaf and food is placed on the leaf to devour. It was good value for money. Had butter chicken, tandoori chicken, squid curry. I prefer my rotis crispy but was soft still good though. I feel the staff should take more attention with the rice and check if patrons require more. I noticed a few tables near us were looking for extra rice but have up. Staff are nice but could be more aware of your needs. Next time though I think we will try their newer restaurant same name but down the street in Racecourse Rd 
4
Had a Saturday lunch here. Restaurant was busy without being crowded. Menu has a great selection of vegetarian and meat dishes. Service was good and efficient. Food was good value with a meal for two of us costing around 40 dollars. There are no plates and food is served on a banana leaf !! Certain credit cards give you a 10 per cent discount so don't forget to ask
4
Bin here several times now. The food is great. Even when they are busy they keep there level.
They have some long tables in the restaurant. It's for large groups or they serve several small groups on 1 table.
3
We were a group of almost 20 and they handled that ok, but they strugled still with some basic things, like informing us on what the disces were, bringing the right drink to the right persons. The rice came way to late in the meal. Sat in the middle of a big hall and there was little cosyness about that. But to me the food was really good and that saved the evening. Pluss also for really cold beers and working aircon
2
I do not know about the taste of fish head curry that they serve here but we left this place with bad taste and bad memories. It seems that they are basking in the glory of the past. The staff who attended us was not only impolite but arrogant. The place is known among non-Indians who want to try Indian curry but if you are an Indian I strongly recommend you to avoid this place as they are not interested in you. Place smacks of sheer commercialization
5
If you enjoy Indian food do not miss out on this place. Leave your 5 star expectations at the door as the waiters do look a bit bored and the restaurant does look a bit closed in and depressed but the food is exceptionally good. Definitely try the lime juice as well
4
Lunch at the Banana Leaf located in Little India, Singapore was truly a foodie experience. It was lovely to have your food served on a banana leaf, with so much flavour. Even though it is a very busy restaurant, the service is excellent. The variety of food is to die for!
5
I tried fish head curry, small $22, for the first time. It was so yummy! I also ordered cheese naan, the first cheese I have had in 2 weeks. Gobbled it down! ! My husband ordered chicken briyani $10. That would have been enough for both of us since it was a huge bowl, again very spicy. The white yogurt bowl of something had quite a bite as well. He kept thinking it was just yogurt but when I tried it I told him that was the spiciest thing on the table! Wait staff friendly but reserved. Service very fast. Ate food on banana leaves. Very nice restaurant inside.
5
This restaurant is a well known tourist spot. The establishment itself is very basic, but very clean --- so expect great food at excellent prices.I had the south Indian chicken masala and it was excellent. Everyone in my group loved their meals. The portions are generous so you may want o consider sharin
1
This place has little to recommend itself. The food portions were small (four scraps of chicken in the butter chicken), expensive ($64 for 3 curries and rice), bored waiters, noisy air conditioner and a dated and soulless room that resembled a food hall. Eating out should be an exciting experience. This was just bland, boring and passionless. I regret a wasted night in our brief stopover in Singapore. The food hall in the shopping centre near our hotel would have been better! Avoid at all costs.
5
It had been a long time since I had some kuttu parotta and when my friend suggested that there is a place in Singapore which makes one of best kuttu parottas anywhere I was in for a surprise. Some tiger beer followed by kuttu parotta was just a great finish to a lovely visit to Little India
5
I have eaten many a curry in my life(i grew up in England and lived in Nottingham and London) and i can tell you this ..... the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan are the best i have EVER tasted. The sheeka kebab(another tandoor delight) is not too shabby either. This restaurant is famed for its fish head curry and on this i cannot comment but if you stick to the tandoori fare you cant go wrong
4
I love their chicken sambal, cabbage and fish head curry .
South Thali meal is must try dish and don't forget the long beans and cabbage as your vege dish.
5
We're taken here by local friends.I Really liked the biranee. Will be on the list for all future singapore visits.
5
Great food, prompt service, fair price and a convenient Little India location. What more do you need?
3
Tried BLA as we love a good banana leaf meal.We were promptly seated and the restaurant didn't look too busy. However it took at least 10 mins before wait staff attended to us and that was after we prompted the cashier! Unfortunately the vegetarian thali was not available after 5pm and we had to order items separately. This made the meal much more expensive. Additionally some items on the menu were not available at that location but available at the Race Course Rd main outlet. That was really disappointing.Overall, whilst what we ordered was good, the dining experience was not. We will try the Race Course Rd outlet next time
4
I'm afraid this won't be as detailed a review as we came here as the guests of an Indian Singaporean couple. They did the ordering and also paid so I can't comment on the prices. We did have the fish head curry which was delicious! There was also okra and another vegetable dish. The place is called Banana Leaf because you eat off a banana leaf. The food is presented family style. They will come by and scoop rice onto your banana leaf (and refill if you want) and then you add the curry onto your banana leaf and eat with your hands. I supposed they have cutlery but I love eating with my hands! The decor in the place is very swank, as stated above, we were invited here. Service is prompt. I would recommend this place for a unique dining experience and of course the fish head curry
5
We visit this place every time we're in Singapore for the best fish head curry fix. We visited twice during our 5 days holiday and we were not disappointed. Not a big fan of other dishes but we love the spicy, tangy and delicious curry which doesn't have coconut milk in it
5
We went here as we had seen that it had some gluten free options and we were not diappointed in fact we had one of the best meals we have ever had. The food was beyond fantastic. i had the best banana smoothie ever. our meals came quickly we loved the banana leaf places mats. A lovely restaurant we will be visiting again before the end of our holida
2
I am a regular visitor of Banana leaf Apollo. Usually go by to get lunch or dinner if I'm arnd the area which is once a week minimum. Never experienced this before. Bought pepper chicken, my sore mutton rice and papadam for 24.60$. Upon opening the pkt at home there as a weird smell. Not looking too much into this I served the food on the plate. When eating it the stale of the food really came thru. Even the mutton wasn't fresh really hard to break. Even the papadam which is usually crispy was so hard. My husband tried the food and after 3 bites threw it into the bin. Such a disappointment to go home and face this situation when the restaurant is so reputable. Utterly disgusted. How can any restaurant serve staleFood. Should be totally ashamed. Hope the management takes this seriously n looks into it.
5
I was relieved to find have a cool restaurant in Little India, as I was dehydrated and sweltering after a long walk around Singapore Central. The host was very welcoming and the menu was extensive with both Northern and Southern Indian food selections. It looked like a food court at first but we ordered Chicken Tikka an Tandoori (hot fired clay oven) Prawns from the wait staff. Our sparking waters with real lime juice were very refreshing. The crispy garlic naan with delicious sauces was just the right amount of great spices and well prepared Indian cuisine. It was all great prices and I could use my credit card here unlike most other Little India eateries
4
My wife and me visited Little India of Singapore. Based on a recommendation we had a lunch in Banana Leaf Apolo. Our very tasty meal consisted of Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) and salad Palak Panner (Palak Paneer). Altogether under 20 $. We still remember the lively Indian families eating with fingers at neighboring tables
4
The portions on this restaurant are large, the food is tasty and fresh.The service was good and friendly. It is not cheap but it was good value for money. Recommended.
5
A local recommended this restaurant for the best curry in Singapore. We weren't disappointed! Authentic food with no fuss and served on a banana leaf. Delicious and great value for money.
4
great indian cuisine but dont expect posh.
-----------------------------------------------------------
5
I spent 40 $ Singapore had a couple of beers and a great meal, well worth a visit food was superb....and as name suggests served on a banana leaf !!
4
The chicken kurma was fantastic! Overall a lovely meal with no complaints. Was very busy and despite taking a while to be served the food was straight out! Will go again !
4
Had dinner at this restaurant upon recommendation from my friends. Nice and spacious indoor, and not crowded much which made it pleasant. I was looking for spicy south indian dishes. But the menu and taste was more north indian. However food was tasty and portions were large. Prices were nominal
4
Enjoyed dinner with friends at this lively and busy place. we arrived a bit early to avoid the rush, but place was soon full! Delicious signature dish - fish head curry. Didn't have the squid curry we wanted and substituted with the black ink squid, which was only OK. needed lots of rice, which was regularly topped up, to deal with the curries! Decent meal and around $120 with wine for 3 people
5
After my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore closed down, I had to find a new one. This really is the best Indian I have had in terms of their curries and breads. They have an extensive selection of curries and the breads are to die for! So tasty! Everyone I have brought here has loved it.
4
We stopped in for dinner on a Thursday night, place was packed which I always think is a good sign, air conditioning was a welcome relief. Plate is a banana leaf, best curry I have had, good selection, Beer was cold. Would definitely go again for Indian food. Bill a bit slow when requested, not the cheapest, but certainly not unreasonable
5
Whilst walking around Little India we stopped for a bite to eat and had been recommended, by friends, to try a "banana leaf curry". We chose this restaurant as the heat outside was soaring and we didn't want to eat at a table on the street in that heat, so an air conditioned restaurant was ideal.The staff were very friendly and the maÃ®tre d' (I assume the restaurant manager / owner) welcomed us in and came in a couple of times to make sure we were happy. It wasn't very busy inside, just a couple of other tables with Indian visitors, which is always a good omen when people are eating their own national food in a restaurant in a foreign country.The food itself was delicious. I'm a huge fan of Indian food and this was one of the best I've had for a long time and easily beats the rubbish often served on London's Brick Lane.The "banana-leaf" is a bit of a gimmick, the food would have been just as good on a plate, but still, it's a nice change to feel you are doing something more "cultural"! The other point is that you eat with your fingers, scooping the curry and rice onto your naan bread and eating that way. Nothing strange here really as this is the way most Indians naturally eat their food, but for a white English couple it felt "fun" to eat the proper Indian way.The food was great, staff friendly and good value for money. Highly recommended if in the area
4
The restaurant is very nice food and we felt like exact India culture. Worth eat at the Banana Leaf in Little India Town, Singapore.
5
We been this restaurant 2 times I'm from Turkey , my partner is from Singapore we both really enjoy the food !!! Highly recommend this restaurant !!!
5
We had friends tell us about the fish head curry, but we could not decide the menu is so good. We decided to share 2 mains with rice, papadams, naan and condiments it was huge and great value for money. We will be back soon.
5
My friends and I went here on our last night and it did not disappoint. The food was amazing and I wish I could have gone there for all my meals that weekend. The portion sizes are small, so order enough. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Indian Food.
5
The food was so great we went back again. One of our party did not wish her food to be served on a banan leaf which is the restaurant's 'staple' and was accomodated. Two nights later when we went back we were seated and a banana leaf'less plate appeared in front of her without us having to request one. Incredible service, incredible food, and had we stayed in singapore longer we'd have gone back again for sure
4
Was recommended by the locals to have an authentic curry at this restaurant .not very flash ,but the food is good. They serve your food on a banana leaf. Very traditional . My husband had tikka masala ,I had buttered chicken . Both meals were really good. Expect to pay around $50 inc a beer and coke. If your looking for traditional the it worth a visit
3
I visited Apolo again and the food is still the same tasty but their service is very slow and poor. Had to wait quite some time for the waiter to take order and when i asked for extra sugar for the coffee, had to wait for almost 15 minutes. The management should employ more staff
5
As the name suggests, the food is served on a banana leaf. Indian food comes with a variety of spices and colours and one could taste the real Indian food in Apolo. The place is packed with food lovers from different nations enjoying the very quick service and some spicy food made in authentic Indian style. Cheap to
4
Banana Leaf has two outlets-the main one is in race course road and the branch in which we used to take our meal is in little india We took south indian set meal/thali for lunch which was very elaborate, tasty ,fresh and sumptuous It was complete with papadam,1 chapati,3 vegetables,sambaram,curd and payasam and of course a bowl of rice One thali costing S$8 was sufficient for two of us!!The restaurant was very spacious,very neat and clean. Service was very prompt and staff were very courteous Very satisfying meal we had there One thing must be mentioned-they do not serve set meal for dinner and so we took masala dosa for dinner and despite being from india, i must admit that it was one of the tastiest dosa i have ever taken!!One masala dosa costs S$4 If this review prompts you to dine in banana leaf, and find my observation to be correct, please do not forget to give me a helpful vot
4
I visited the restaurant along with a number of colleagues during a fam tour related to my work. We visited the place for dinner and it was packed. But the service was good; staff were attentive and helpful. The meals were quite filling. We ordered lamb curries with rice and other bread works and apparently, the fish head curry was a delicacy and so some of my colleagues ordered one or two dishes. The curry was really good, and one dish of the curry could be consumed by three people atleast (I would say. Full grown men, maybe two can have one dish and it would still be enough). Overall, the meals were excellent and if you are a lover of spice and anything nice, you will enjoy this
4
A bunch of us from around the world descended on this establishment for a group meal. The staff were accommodating, food well priced and plentiful. My chicken was hot and tasty. No plates here they give you banana leaves to eat off, great idea.
5
Awesome spicy food place.. I only eat briyani at this food outlet out of any food place at serangoon north..
4
Food was great... service was fast and the place had amazing originally feeling. Like i was in India.
Tandoor chicken was supreme. Best chicken what i have ever tasted
5
Like the title, this is the best Indian I have tasted outside of India!! Unbelievably tasty!! And when you are finished, Little India is well worth a wander through!!
4
We choose this because we have some extra money before we go home. I like the food very much, the taste is very nice and very real.
5
Nothing beats authenticity when you visit Little India and try their delectable cuisine! My family and I walked under the blistering heat for almost 20 minutes around the area and finally sought shelter in Banana Leaf Apolo and tried one of Singapore's national dishes - the fish head curry. The customers are very diverse, coming from all walks of life, so the staff are well-accustomed to visitors like us. Since it was our first time, and we have no idea what to do, the staff helped us and walked us through the menu.Like my husband said, he is not a fan of curry but the FISH HEAD CURRY is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND A MUST TRY! He paired it with the sweet, nutty and fragrant SAFFRON RICE. We didn't mind the heat from the curry sauce because it was just that good! We ended up ordering 3 Mango lassi (Mango yogurt smoothie) and 4 orders of Saffron rice to help offset the heat from the curry.TIP: Eating with your hands (right hand, that is) makes it an even more authentic experience.IF WE ARE VISITING SINGAPORE, WE ARE SURE TO VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN
5
How I love this place. Every time I visit Singapore it is one of the highlights. I love to go at night when Little India is bustling and vibrant - and so is the restaurant. Excellent Indian food with strong Malay overtones. The curried fish head soup is the outstanding favourite for me but the menu is packed with excellent food. And the food is served on a banana leaf in case you may wonder. Service was gunfire rapid. What a great place .....
5
I was there with a group of friends, and they have such good Indian food. They also know their dishes, since I don't like to spicy food they recommended a couple different one to me. I chose Butter Chicken and it was amazing. Ended up going here several times; the food is that good
5
The staff are so friendly and alert! Always ready to serve you. Fast and efficient service. The food is amazing. Best fish head curry along that stretch in my opinion. The butter chicken, fish cutler and prawn masala are also heavenly. My favourites! Great place to bring guest from overseas. Special thanks to Sankar and Bala for always being so hospitalable whenever I visit
4
we were not seaking this place out, only found out later it was featured on an episode of Andrew Zimmerns Bizarre Foods for their Fish Head Curry. Since this dish was designated the "house specialty" we ordered a small for lunch, along with a chicken tikka masala set and an order of chicken curry. Started out with garlic naan and vegetable samosas. Everything was quite good, I especially like the chicken curry and of course the fish head curry. The small order was plenty for 2 people, and with the other dishes, we had more than we could comfortably eat. The food is dished out onto a banana leaf, and the locals all used their hands in the customary Indian style - we used forks and spoons. You really don't want to use your hands, in my opinion. The washrooms are located back of the kitchen, and are to be avoided at all costs - use your own hand sanitizer and the napkins and wet naps you bring yourself. Like all the restaurants in Singapore, napkins of any kind are basically non-existent, even when the custom is eating with your hands - still can't figure that out. Is that why they wear such colorful clothes, to hide the stains from wiping their hands on their shirt or pants? Anyway, this food was good, not really cheap ($22 for small fish head, but only $5 for an order of chicken curry - way overpriced and a bargain, respectively). With 2 lime juices, 2 Tigers, and the lunch we were set back $74 SGD (abt $60 US). We ordered too much, could easily skip the fish head and get out of there at about 2/3 the price. If you're in Little India, definitely try the food, and this place is as good as any to get a taste of authentic Indian food
3
Back visiting the Banana Leaf Apolo after many years away. Business appears to have boomed for them - bigger spaces more tables, but the food seems to be blah. A great disappointment.
4
Famous for its curry fish head. Rice and vegetable are served on banana leaves. Mutton masala, king prawn and flower crab are our favourite dishes. Food is reasonably priced. We normally spend about SGD50.00 for two with drinks.
4
In Singapore there are plenty of options for a nice Indian meal (that excludes food courts, of course, although some of the dishes served there are also very good). We had visited before several other restaurants on Serangoon Road and found that the "better looking" ones (read: "directed at tourists") lacked the authentic taste (simply said: some of the dishes turned out just bland). So, we had our reservations making this reservation....This was our first visit in this restaurant, and it was over a national holiday, so you would expect slack service. Nothing of that sort! Service was very attentive, with typical Singaporean Indian courtesy. All you needed to do was to actually make an eye contact and one of the attendants would right away show around (and no, we were not all "tourists" as majority were local Singaporeans in our group). Food came out great tasting and there was plenty of it. There were six of us in the group ordering variety of dishes and none of these dishes came up short on anything. We decided to visit this place during our next trip to Singapore. Well worth a repeated visit
4
I have lunch there.You will be served with a banana leaf as your plate. The food is authentic.I order their signature dish, Curry Fish Head. It is a portion big enough to feed three. You will know why the restaurant (or the patrons) makes it the signature.I also order dry masala mutton and chicken tikka with rotik. All are yumm but within expectation.  In terms of location, the branch I go is right in the Little India Arcade. You can also get entry by the door around the corner.I believe there is another branch in the neighbourhood
4
The atmosphere of this family restaurant is great. Food was tasty and reasonably priced, the mango lassi was fantastic. Language barriers are being circumvented by being able to order through an iPad. They didn't have dosas (pancakes) though which I wanted to try as these are a forte in Singaporean Indian food
4
This place was rocking the block like not other restaurant. The service and food came out at a rapid rate, the tables turned over quickly. It's family style seating, so don't be shy. The price was right and the food lived up to it's expectations. I ended up here with a local. I don't know if I would of found it otherwise. Carry the address around so you don't get sent on a milk run finding this place
5
I had a great experience at the Banana Leaf in Little India in Singapore. Each dish is beautifully eaten off if a banana leaf. I had the palak paneer, pappadum, garlic naan and veggie biryani rice. The food is flavorful and fresh and the atmosphere is hopping! I recommend
4
We had tasty onion pakora's to start. Curry's were very good and excellent Naan bread. You could see the guy making and cooking the bread in the tandoor which was interesting. Service was quick and efficient. One little niggle ..... They charge for paper napkins and after eating with your fingers you need them! It's a peanut charge but I'd rather they put a dollar on the food
5
Banana Leaf, the name sounded interesting. Surely enough we get in the restaurant and place our orders. We get served on the banana leaf. Its back to basics, this is how the ancestors would eat in the village. Food was tasty and it was served very quick. The restaurant was full of locals so you can tell it must be a favourite of the town. Staff were very friendly too. Serving size is decent. We were actulally not very hungry to start with and only went in to check the place out. But when the food came out, we couldnt stop eating. I ordered extra naan and it was available within minutes.You have to try the following:Fried FishFish ManchurianThis place is in little india part of Singapore.Recommend it
4
Good Indian curries in Singapore. Ate there on 1 night. Served on a banana leaf. Curry was tasty. Service was good. Cannot comment on the atmosphere as we were only 1 of 2 tables there that evening. Maybe it was a quiet night!Had a look at the other dishes prepared as well since it seemed like the curries are cooked in advance and left in warmers. The kitchen section/ counters with the warmers can be viewed if requested

We had a wonderful authentic home cooked meal. Price was right. Good service. A good choice. Family style if you prefer or order your own dinner. Condiments, papadums and extra veggies are included in the meal
2
We went here for lunch and didn't had a good experience.
Food was average but surely better in most other places.
Atmosphere was nothing special and the staff don't care at all about the customers.
4
No booking yet still got in. Made our order and waited a bit. Got naan bread and meats but no rice to go with it. Time we got the rice, the meat was warm. Flavours were nice though.
4
I wen for the same reasons as everyone...because Bourdain and Zimmern recommended i. I had the fish head curry and it was awesome. I even ate the eyeball. I can scratch it off the bucket list !
4
The restaurant was very helpful and accommodating to our group of 16. The dishes were yummy and everyone got enough to eat. Would definitely go again.
4
Foodwise this as good as it gets. Great tandoor, flavourful curries, fresh vegetables, the best lassie, but....the service is indifferent and the environment only a notch above functional.
Go for the food and over look the other shortcomings.
5
There were no dishes as such, a banana leaf was placed in front of you and the waiter served the food on this, very good food, and we returned several times over our 4 night stay.

When I moved to Singapore almost 8 months ago I had only tried the indian food a couple of times. There was nothing to reminisce over. However, once I tried this truly authentic restaurant in Little India I was greatly surprised. Ever since I put my feet on the restaurant, I have kept going to the banana at least once a week. The prices are damn fair and I can even have a great dinner with my wifey for less than 30SGD!!I have many personal favs: Chicken Malay, Chicken Korma, Prawn Masala, Dragon Chicken... always combined with an excellent briyani with vegetables. The atmosphere is very clean and fresh and it's not too noisy because the restaurant is barely crowded. Sometimes a particular dish might be either slightly spiced or extra hot depending on the cook and that's the only objection that keeps this stunning restaurant from remaining flawless

I have been eating at Banana Leaf Apolo, mainly at Racecourse Avenue, on and off for 18 years. On this visit with a Chinese friend who loves curry, I ordered Sri Lankan crab curry, for the first time. We also ordered fish head curry, squid, Tiger beer, and Biriyani rice to go with it.Well, what arrived as Sri Lankan crab curry wasn't the dish I expected. (BTW, I am Sri Lankan.) Covered in chilli paste, the taste of crab was lost in the mess that was served.The fish head curry was equally spicy. The food tasted of nothing but chillies.The service was friendly and quick, and, at 3pm, the place wasn't crowded or too noisy. Our bill came to S$89

We had visited Banana Leaf Apollo as a group, to celebrate our Diwali celebration. the food was ordered pretty much earlier, so the idea was to just go there and have food and move on. The good things first , atmosphere was good. We were served biryani at first, by the time the side dishes were served, every one had eaten biryani with out any side dish, as it took so much time for them to serve to us. the same story was followed for the rest of the dishes too. There was no schedule, every thing was haphazard. running around and not serving any thing nor making any one happy.Over all it was a disaster, we went in to celebrate and improve the mood , and we managed to achieve the exact opposite. i am not sure whether this has been one bad day for them, or that's how it is every time, but one thing is sure, i will not be visiting this establishment in a hurry
3
Good for the south indian food. Good fish head curry.
Rice quality is bad though but the spiciness of the curry covers up for it.
Would not advise to eat their northern indian food like kebab and naan. There are better options around
5
The Banana Leaf is apparently well known, but I only found out from a friend on email once I was in Singapore. I went there with a young traveller I had met. We thoroughty enjoyed the meal. It is a culinary experience at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended
4
The Food was different to what we have in India, The taste was bit asian but the dishes are Indian (Its mostly a variation of Tamil/South Indian cusine by the Indian origin people in Singapore). The chicken masala was great. Fish cutlet was good. Prawn masala we did not like that much.Yes ambience bit noisy, You will have a feel that you are in india . Also I think vegetarian dishes are not that great, Lot of other options are there for that
5
Recently had lunch at this restaurant. We were taken to here by a local Singaporean, we didn't want the food to be too spicy (had my 11 year old daughter with us) so our friend said that this was the place to go. Great novelty value of eating off the banana leaf instead of a plate and the food was great. The service was good. We tried a variety of dishes and also had the Lime juice which was delicious. Would definately recommend you search out this place when in Little India
5
I suspect that most of the people who have criticized this restaurant have never lived in India. I've lived in India and this is by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Stick to the Southern Indian cuisine (that's what they're known for). The food was downright excellent. Everything was very tasty. The service is just like all restaurant service in India and elsewhere in Asia - terrible. Just face it, you're not paying for that, you're paying for delicious Indian food. And by the way, the food is VERY reasonably priced. I had a huge lunch (curry chicken, samosas, naan, beer) for US$15
5
Although the waiter brought me something different from what I ordered, when I pointed it out, he very quickly changed it and brought me back a very very delicious chana masala. The naan and poppadoms were good too. The price was reasonable and I would go back. I love Indian food and I would say this is one of the best I have had in Asia
4
We had a really tasty meal here.You all eat on trestle tables and the service is very fast,almost like a conveyor belt.The atmosphere was good and the price was even better.Dont visit if your expecting an english indian restaurant, but we really enjoyed our visit ther
4
Located in the middle of buzzling Little India, this is a good choice to go to with friends since the food is delicious and they can accommodate also big groups. Very good value too. Service is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is lively- noisy, a little dining- hall like, so nothing for a romantic dinner. The fish head curry, their signature dish, is wonderful. Can recommend
4
The Banana Leaf Apolo It easy to go. It near Little India subway station and Mustafa 24 hour Shopping mall so you can shop in the morning and have lunch at The Banana Leaf Apolo and go afternoon shopping again. I love The Banana Leaf Apolo because friendly from people in restaurant I order Chicken Tandoori with Cheese Naan, mutton biryani and some curry for me old people from next table smile and said to me good order. It made my lunch so delecious and wonderful. At that day I came only one but waiter of The Banana Leaf Apolo can find one table for me in lunch time with cloud of people. So every time I visit Little india at Singapore I must visit The Banana Leaf Apolo at little India every lunch time

My family and I, we had lunch at Banana Leaf.. And, ummm..... it was good... the vegetarian dishes.. were good, prawn curry, chicken curry.. were good too... surprisingly good was the squid curry... This fusion curry was awesome... The squids in the curry were so soft and well manageable (even by my 5 years' old son).. we liked every bit of it...I noticed this Restaurant first time on tripadvisor (thanks to you!!!) while I had been making plans for Singapore trip... but during visit I forgot about Banana Leaf, completely... Then, again re-noticed it by seeing the crowd in/outside the restaurant... while we (my lovely wife, 2 adventurous kids and me) were passing through that area...... And, could instantly recall the name from memory.. and decided to stop by and experience.And, I was not disappointed... The food was good, though it took 68 SGD to buy that satisfaction... which is around 3 times more than any hawker food centre/ stall. My experiences say.. Indian Food Tastes Better Outside India... So, I like them sometimes when I travel overseas...
4
Restaurant was recommended by a local. Good choice of North Indian and South Indian food, in a slightly noisy environment (well, it is Little India!!). Inexpensive, given the quality of the food. Service was fine too. Will certainly go back.
4
Good food in clean surroundings at a fair price served by people who genuinely wanted the customer to enjoy their meal.
5
Amazing restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious and the mutton biriyani is out of this world! The naans, meat and vegetarian options are out of this world! The mango lassi is heavenly.Totally recommend it!
Good for a casual meal!
5
Extensive menu from all areas of India. Veg and non-veg, lassis, marsala chai, chat, curries, wide choice of breads....and all delicious, plus very reasonable prices.
Local Indian people eat here and recommend the restaurant.
4
The food at Apollo in Little India Arcase was good, some dishes was good whilst others was not the best. The pricing is also on the high side. I have eaten here before and thought the food was much better, maybe new chefs. The hotel is definitely recommended
3
My Singaporean friend recommended that they serve the best Fish Head Curry in town. I have eaten lots of curry fish head and I must say that I'm very disappointed if this is one of the best. Their service staff recommended their Chicken Masala and again, it was below par. It is one of those restaurant that you will give it a miss after trying it for one time
5
Had lunch at the Banana Leaf again after 18 years. It is approximately 5 times as as big now and has opened another branch but most importantly the food is still awesome. had some mixed vegetarian dishes with my Indian friend and fresh coconut water. The brinjal/tomato/capsicum was so tasteful and so were the sambal and the rasam. service in our case was pretty good, too.And for Singapur very good value for the price they charge
4
Serves a wide range of tasty Indian food in fairly functional surroundings. Not a place for a stylish night out, but rather more like an upmarket food centre. The range and quality of the dishes were really good, and there was no problem for me with the degree of spiciness - nor was there for any of the half dozen other people in the group we were with. Locals like this restaurant, and that is quite a compliment given the range of good food options in Singapore
4
First try of a restaurant in Little India. Mentioned in our guide book. It was good to see it being used by locals, eating their food with their hands off a banana leaf. They provided us with a fork and spoon so our hands didn't get quite so messy! We thought the food was very tasty although the staff did appear a little off-hand. I formed the impression they were used to dealing with local trade and not the tourist. However, that said, we did enjoy our meal and thought the price wasvery reasonable. A enjoyable visit
3
This has to be one of the bad restuarents in Singapore. And with my experience i get a feeling that their policy is charge the customer and give no service. It takes ages to get your order, and the waiters/staff could be the most rude people you could ever see on the earth. As for the food quality you could just walk to tekka market and get more tastier food at a much lower rate. Riddicules pricing and aweful taste
4
Had lunch here today after along time and was impressed as usual. The consistency and tase of their chicken masala is simply super.
The other dishes are average but the house special is certainly the chicken masala....to die for.
4
Really like the food there and the environment.
A banana leaf will be used as a plate.
Full of Indian people which proof that is a good value for money !
5
While Banana Leaf Apollo is pricey by Little India Standards. It has excellent food and is well air conditioned. Almost a mandatory visit each time I go back to Singapore.
4
The prices here were a little lower than the Banana Leaf on Racecourse road and it was not as crowded. The staff were very welcoming.I was very surprised when my meal arrived to have a banana leaf placed on the table in front of me and the food spooned directly on to it. No plate required! The food was much spicier than expected, but this did not stop me from enjoying my meal
1
Which Hotel charges for a glass of water especially in a country like Singapore where they most likely filled up the glass from the tap.Rude, impolite and uncourteous are just mild versions of describing the staff.Free wet wipes are placed on the table when you walk in and choose a seat. But they also find their way to your bill (chek) once you have used them but ofcourse with a price tagged to it. Definitely Not a visitor friendly restaurant
5
As soon as we saw that the majority of the clientelle were Indian and not necessarily tourists, we realised we had struck gold with this restaurant. The food is served on a banana leaf and the rice is brought around in a huge pot. All our choices proved delicious with varied flavours and not just curry sauce poured over things as is unfortunately the case in many such restaurants in the UK. The service was not the fastest, but we were not in a hurry so it didn't matter. The fruit juices were freshly squeezed and lovely. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Singapore
3
We had an ok meal here. Both my partner and I were looking forward to curries on a banana leaf, however when it came, especially the veggie meal it lacked any flavour and was bland. Surroundings were ok, and all in all not as good as other premises we considered
5
We visited this restaurant on the basis of the concierge's reccomendation at our hotel (Moon Hotel, Little India, Singapore).This place is a little gem. Without the recco of the concierge, it certainly wouldnt have been a place I would have dined at. However, we are certainly glad we did. Indeed, we returned on two occasions.The food is fresh and made on the spot for you. Should you wish, you can watch your food being prepared by the chefs behind glass. The NAAN was incredible. Service is very fast and the waiters are courteous, efficieient speak strong english
2
We went here last week in a group of 5 adults and 5 kidsWe asked the waiter whats good he said all are good in the end we ordered banana leaf tali meal for adults and chapati for kids, the tali meal was just 2 gravy's and rice, i could not believe they could just call it tali because other places serve so many gravys fried and other accompaniments The chapati did not arrive when our rice was finishing we called a waiter he said will check another 5 minutes nothing happened when we tried to atract a waiter they just ignored us and look the other way and it took more than 15 mins for the chapati to arriveI dont know why this place is so famous the tali was the weakest i ever had, the service was bad the prices are so high compared other simillar places nearb

Southern Indian specialities plus Northern tandoori styles as well. Banana leaf is your plate, not like some dummies who think its a place mat. Eat straight off the leaf your choices and rice etc. drinks to suit all tastes and prices. Cobra beer for example 7 dollars. With young children not wanting any formality this was just perfect. It was approaching Devali celebrations so entire area hugely busy, some, lots,eating on the streets simitvwas nice to get inside aircon restaurant. Great welcome efficient service and 70 dollars for 4 adults plus one junior eater inc drinks. Not bad. Will go again. If you do please use the banana leaf as your plate as intended, use your hand or the cutlery provided with or without nan. Enjoy the experience and clean up sfterward
3
It was kid's birthday today. we have some bad experience today with the food.some of the food was edible.
3
Place was hard to find. Mango curry and chicken tikka masala were excellent. Waiter could have helped us more with our choice. Started cleaning while we were eating due to closure at 10pm on Sun.
2
i ordered banana leaf rice with a piece of fried fish and chicken masala. fish tasted stale, chicken was tasteless. i've had (much) better banana leaf rice in malaysia.
5
Brilliant place ,good beer great food ,excellent service,tremendous atmosphere,casual dining ,what more can you ask ?and we reckon were experts.Try it.
5
Now I know what I've been missing. Great food. I wish there was a restaurant like it in Bangkok
4
Food and service was good and in an interesting part of Singapore. We were there at about 9pm and it was reasonably quiet in the restaurant.
Easy walk from Little India stop on the MRT
4
Food was absolutely fantastic and portions very generous. However, service was rather poor, not rude but unfriendly, and we waited for our drinks/food for quite a while (starters came together with our mains). Also, don't bother complementing the food, they don't seem to care whether you like it or not. Despite all that it is worth giving it a go as food is really really good
3
My friends and I visited Banana Leaf last week, and we were looking forward to have a good meal. Interestingly, what we had wanted were mostly "not being served" in spite of the fact that it was not even 7pm. Those listed on the menu for Southern Indian cuisine were not available, and other dishes when they were served we realised that they did not taste as good as before. That said, there was one particular dish which was considered above average - Black Dhaal - but over all I am not sure if I would recommend friends to Banana Leaf. The Chapatti, the Masala Tea, the Ginger Tea were just warm, not the usual "hot" standard. Service-wise was even stranger. The waiters disappeared just when you were about to place your order. When they returned, immediately after you have listed the first dish, the waiters vanished again. It was such a strange encounter
5
This is a must every time we visit Singapore. Last visit a few weeks ago..it has gone up market... your banana leaf now comes on a plate. This is an experience you have to have it is in Little India, easy to get to on the MRT..just a short walk from the station. You will not leave hungry...great cheap food...good service and great atmosphere. Go for a walk around Little India to walk off your curry, it is well worth it
5
Our taxi driver recommended The Banana Leaf and we were not disappointed. The clientele is a mixture of more locals than tourists. We ordered what we thought were small bites and ended up with way too much food for two of us. They serve it on a banana leaf and several people around us were eating the traditional way with their right hand. We felt like we were actually in India. Nice choice
4
the fish head curry is a must. served on a banana leaf, the rice, curried string beans and cabbage are spooned right onto the banana leaf and the fish head curry is brought in a large bowl. try it, you like it.
4
The food was good. We had the pepper crab and chili chicken with saffron rice, all were good. Portions were generous enough, three of us (women) were able to share the two plates. Nice atmosphere and interesting neighborhood.
5
Do yourself a favour, eat Indian where the locals eat. Really enjoyed the food!
4
we really enjoyed this restaurant , great atmosphere , good service , wonderful food
5
Really enjoyed our lunchtime meal here. We chose the vegetarian platter together with roti and a dhal. The vegetables were really tasty: on skewers and rubbed in spices then cooked in the tandoor - mmm...
3
walking distance of Hotel Perak. south indian food already prepared and given to you at a moments notice.. Not cheap but good service and nice ambience
5
The foods are really different with its representation and the sitting place was really clean. I would love trying the fish heads if I go there again.
4
Their briyani is awesome and you should not miss it
4
Since we found this Indian restaurant about a month ago... We try to eat here at least once a week!!! What a yummie and tasty food... Exept from naan bread and chicken tikka, we did not know the Indian kitchen at all... But thanks to Banana Leaf... We every time try some more dishes... There are a huge variety of dishes to order... And if not on the menu... They are always willing to prepare it for you... You don't get a plate to eat from, but as the name says... A banana leaf, which is very innovative.. (for us!!!)At first sight (for us westerners) this establishment does not look Cosy, trendy or whatsoever... But don't think of all the thrills... Or whatsoever...The food is real good, all is clean and the cooks working very hygienic.. As you can see them cooking behind a glass wall!!!... And not to forget... The prices are verrrrrryyyyyyy reasonable!!!!The restaurant/kitchen is continuously open from 11 am - 11 p
2
I ordered butter chicken at $11 then rice that was not on the menu. I was told it is an additional $3 to see $3.50 on my bill. And a charge for a wet towel that I didn't use but told I need to pay for regardless. Also was not allowed take any rice in a take out container...or bag should I say. I'd look elsewhere
1
overated and expensive
3
One of the bigger and more spacious places in Little India. North Indian food is average quality as you would expect when it is prepared by south Indian chefs. The food is served on Banana Leaves instead of plates. it seemed they reuse the banana leaves which I think should be disposable and one time use only. Don't expect great service but expect average quality food. Their Fresh Lime Soda was very different and nice
4
After walking around for a couple hours we came across this restaurant in the Little India Arcade. The service was good and the food was better. We had the chicken kebab and a biryiani set for lunch. It was more than enough for two and cost $28SGD. Would definitely recommend
2
This restaurant appears on all the tourist guides - but I wonder why. It is pricey, the food is greasy and the waiters are either overworked or incompetent, or both. I would not go back. We went with local friends because I read the recommendations and they obliged. We agreed never to go back. Our local friends called to make a reservation but when I arrived (I was the first one) they said there is no reservation so they just sat me at a table. When my friends came they were sat at another table in a different part of the restaurant. We waited for each other for 30 minutes, even though we were all there...
4
Really enjoyed the food and found the prices very reasonable. Hadn't experienced a large indian restaurant with this type of atmosphere before. They brought out our entree at the same time as the main meal which was very strange. I would recommend this as a place to eat. Our waiter was very abrupt and impatient
3
On a typical night at Banana Leaf Apolo you’ll probably see a copy of the Lonely Planet on ever other table. So yes, no hiding the fact that this very busy place is pretty touristy. But why, I sometimes wonder, as the food is kind of average at best. The tandori mixed appetizer platter that I foolishly keep trying whenever I go, for example, is consistently bland and the rice is pretty much always cold, and even their naan breads kind of miss the mark sometimes. There’s no doubt in my mind though, that at one time BLA ruled the neighborhood way back when, but that was a long time ago, as these days Little India is full of much better choices for serious Indian food. Mustards, a few doors down, for example, is simply awesome. I’m not saying BLA is a bad choice, but you can do much better. However…whenever I’m in SG and want some fish head soup, then this is the place where I come. It is the one thing that is consistently great. The flavor is deep and rich with interesting seasonings that will blow you away. It will not disappoint, as it’s delicious! It comes in various sizes, and I would probably recommend the small or medium, as even the small is quite big. So, I would highly recommend going just for that dish and that dish alone, while reserving your further exploration of Indian cuisine for other places. LI is such a great place for Indian food, so just go ahead and try as many places as you can and enjoy
4
This was our second time at the Banana leaf - we love this place!! This time we came for an early dinner. Great food, delicious curries and breads....and the most amazing cold beer just the ticket for a 30+ degree day.We love eating off the banana leaf with our hands.The wait staff were all charming and very helpful.Thankyou Banana leaf we will be back next tim
5
Food was superb and service amazing. Definitely make it a part of your visit (if you like Indian food, of course). Their specialty is Fish Head Curry and although I was not keen to trying it at first, the waiter convinced me to and it was excellent! For dessert, please try the Kulfi (Indian ice-cream). Very rich and delicious
5
Singapore is not short of amazing food eateries -- king prawns, dumplings, even cooked-to-order stir fry in shopping mall food courts can be amazingly fresh and delicious. Head and shoulders above the dizzying array of culinary choices, our favorite place to eat in Singapore is The Banana Leaf Apolo.Located in a Little India neighborhood of Singapore, your best bet is to arrive by taxi. Your meal is served on a banana leaf, and you eat with your hands. The food is so spicy and hot that you can literally feel the curry traveling down your esophagus. Despite the sweating and burning, you won't want to stop eating, as the flavors are scintillating and the meat is so tender.Yes, your fingernails will turn yellow from the curry. (Also note that this is not a fancy place and that service is not what you would call speedy). No, you won't care. It is worth it! Just don't touch your eyes with your hands until you soap them. Twice.Yum!!!!!

Visited with my wife whilst on a family break (kids looked after by grandparents!) and was very impressed. The smell that hits you when you walk in the door is amazing but not over-powering. We were shown to a table with people at the other end (you do have to share tables) and presented with a very comprehensive menu. Our drinks order was taken quickly and we had to wait about 3 or 4 mins for our food order to be taken. The waiter could not have been more apologetic. I recommend the chilli chicken but be warned, it does pack quite a kick but not as hot as the king prawn spinach dish my wife ordered! The vegetable pakora platter is a sight to behold as well but I can recommend one helping between 2 people - huge portion!The food is served on a banana leaf and coming from Scotland this is my 1st experience of this. The place was buzzing, full of locals and ex-pats and the service amazing. For the 2 of us (starter, 2 mains, rice, naan bread, 2 Kingfisher beers and a mango lassi) it cost just over 50 Singapore Dollars which I thought was fantastic value. They even ordered us a taxi back to our hotel.Everyone's experience and opinion is different but I am quite fussy about my Indian meals and this place ticked all the boxes. DO NOT MISS IT!!
