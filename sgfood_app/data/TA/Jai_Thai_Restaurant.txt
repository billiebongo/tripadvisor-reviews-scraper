our first meal at singapore ,fulfilling to our tired n hungry souls.tasty n fortunately we avoided the lunch rush
3
Simple Thai home cook food located in town with reasonable pricing is reason. Gets quite busy during meal time.
4
As recommended in Lonely Planet Singapore book. Around the corner from our hotel so super convenient. The food came out quickly. Fantastic food, cheap and cheerful as they say, definitely worth a visit!
4
Try the tofu, chicken and basil dish, as well as the mango and sticky rice.
All the dishes we've tried were good and Purvis St is a pretty spot to sit outside, if there's a free table.
For the price, hard to beat.

We were here because First Thai was closed. Though food came out really fast, the quality isn't satisfying. I was looking forward to a good Thai meal but I was really disappointed. The fried fish wth basil leaves tasted weird. The beef red curry was the best. Other dishes such as seafood tang hoon salad and mixed vege are really just average.
3
Had lunch here as we worked in an office in Beach Road. Furniture is all plastic and low cost interior design, fair enough. The Restaurant is open to one side, no aircon (good for me). Service was "sufficiently attentive", even got a smile once in a while.Food: had the "usual" Tom Yam and after that a whole fish - THAT one was phantastic - Pad Thai noodles and a green curry. Everything was tasty, spicy, nothing to complain about. Payment at the counter; again very fairly priced, no complaints.This is an outlet for the casual lunch or early dinner after a long day in office; when you know what you want, don´t want to talk too much nonsense with waitresses and rather be on your own or with friends. For that it´s a good place. It´s certainly not "the best Thai ever", but fairly priced for good food. Nothing more, nothing else
4
We had dinner with a good friend at this cozy Thai restaurant. Do not belittle the simple interior of this place - you order through an iPad tucked underneath your table. The pad thai and tom yum are to die for, and you get to choose how the food can be cooked (i.e. spice level, sauce type). Get their set meals priced at 50+ SGD if you're dining as a group

Visited this little unassuming restaurant after a recommendation.. cannot recommend this place enough. I have visited Singapore many many times and have paid an arm and a leg for many meals that have left me extremely disappointed. This however was simply divine. Order via an iPad.. fresh food arrives very quickly and is absolutely delicious .. still wondering how they do it.. Pandan chicken-crispy on outside and succulent on inside was a dream. Sampled thai red and green curry , numerous side dishes and rice and beers.. cheap as chips and fabulous. We went back on day 3 thinking we had just been lucky and second visit as good as the first.. cannot wait to go back.
4
Went there with friends, the staff is very friendly no problem with them at all, the food was correct for this kind of restaurant, it's nothing exceptional but the job is done. Not very expensive, i recommend if you go there for a quick eating and you don't want to spend a lot of money.
3
Felt like some Thai for dinner, this street is right next door to Raffles. Super quick service but it was really nice & super hot, the sweat was running down our faces. It was really nice & cheap, no frills, street food, beer was only $6!
4
Really enjoyed the red curry, up there with one of the best I've had. Pineapple rice was also quite yummy. Service could be a little more friendly but was efficient
4
This little restaurant was just opposite our hotel so we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. The service was prompt and the food delicious. The meals come in small,medium and large which is a great idea.

Authentic Thai Food Restaurant at Singapore
I would said it almost the same taste as i had in Thailand, but slightly costly compare to Thailand.
3
Nice and affordable Thai restaurant on a side street in the Colonial District. Good quality fresh food, friendly and professional service and outdoor tables on the pavement - a good spot to mix with the locals and enjoy a warm evening.
4
Really nice inexpensive food. Nice to eat outside when it's cooler weather at night. Pretty traditional Singapore architecture on the street makes it a nice setting. Come early because the place fills up.
4
We fell upon this en route from Raffles to our hotel where 2 mains and 3 beers cost half what we had paid for 2 Singapore Slings!!
Delicious pad thai and green curry, service good, basic inside but very tasty, authentic Thai food. Really enjoyed.
3
Came back here for lunch today and opted for the Pad Thai lunch deal at around $10 all in including a drink. Quite tasty and service was reasonably efficient. Food quantity is a bit on the small side but hard to complain at this price point. Very crowded on a Monday lunchtime and we were lucky to get a table (probably more crowded that usual as First Thai, just a few doors up, always seems to be closed on Mondays)

@TheKuoKnowsIt's quiet and it's unassuming. But Jai Thai still manages to pack a powerful punch. So does the liberal use of capsicums in its dishes.The diner, which more resembles a cafe than a restaurant, has a very laid-back feel about it. It's like the many eateries that are so ubiquitous in and around BangkokThe Prawn Cakes are fab. So too are the Fish Cakes. But the former probably has a slight edge in terms of texture.The Mango Salad is a delight. But do watch out for the chillies that lurk menacingly in the background. It is nevertheless very refreshing.I have never been able to work out whether Thai Green or Thai Red curries are spicier. Intuitively it should be the former. But I have come to realise that it might be the latter. They are both very good at Jai Thai.Jai Thai gets the thumbs-up from me. It's simple. It's unfussy. And it's not too expensive. Just what you want for a quite meal.
4
Nice restaurant with a large variations of Thai food with a very authentic taste and at a reasonably price. Please note that they do not accept credit card so bring cash. You can fill in a slip with your order based on the long menu en choose the size of the portions, this way so can taste a variety of dishes.
5
Found this place near my office, as every time I passed the Resto always full. Curiosity come for lunch and I loveeee their pad Thai, green curry and also the Tang Hoon! Don't forget to order their Lime Juice. Price also worth it. Will come back again.
1
A disgrace to Thailand!!! Should be shut down for horrible rude staff. Scoffing and rude blinking at patrons should not be tolerated. Shut this place down. Singapore doesn't deserve a horrid place like this
5
We had very good dishes and I could order a vegan meal - the staff was very helpul on that question. The ginger drink and the coconut were good. The food is typical Thai so be aware of hot spices!We could sit outside, the street is very nice with old sigaporan houses.The toilet is more or less in the kitchen - funny place... :-)Higly recommendable
5
We ate here 4 times while in Singapore and is was by far the best value place we had been to. Great tasty food at a good price with well priced Thai beers. I notice a lot of people going on about bad service but I thought their service was fine. Thoroughly recommend and will visit again when in Singapore
1
We went for dinner at 9pm , while we were eating the waitress stuffed the bill on the table and said impatiently - pay now that was at about 9.20 and the website said they closed at 10pm. They didn't come by to ask if there was any last orders so we said - but we wanted another bowl of rice. The waitress rudely replied - no rice, it's all in the fridge. As we were still eating, the same waitress can by another 2 times and repeated - pay now. We gave them a credit card and the waitress said no card, cash or nets and insisted that we go to the counter to pay via nets right now. The food is great, but This is terrible service
3
We'd been sitting having a drink in Purvis Street, people watching (as you do), and noticed lots of people coming and going from this busy little restaurant. Our hotel had recommended it if we liked Thai food, which we do, so finished our drinks and over we went. It was good, not great, plentiful and cheap
5
This place is a small Thai restaurant I've heard about when arriving in Singapore. Excellent food ! The spicy dishes are quite on fire but you can always ask for a little smoother. Green curry is amazing. Now the delicacy of these dishes is wonderful. Watch out though : they close at 9 pm and we weren't told when arriving at 8:30 - thus we couldn't have dessert unfortunately. But friends familiar to this place confirm dessert are as good as the rest.
3
Having been here a number of times for lunch over the past year or so I decided it was time to try it for dinner. The Pad Thai was a bit oily, the green chicken curry was decent as was the mango salad. The grilled squid was a little bland. I liked the milk tea also. Probably will be back again, although more likely for lunch than for dinner
1
As a local, I came here after a local food blogger reviewed the place as one of the more affordable Thai restaurants in SG. Firstly they didn't allow my Friend to sit on a chair while she was waiting for 3 of us to arrive (Please note that there were 8 empty tables). Secondly we had to remind them for our drinks THRICE, which meant that by the time we had our drinks, we were all done with our mains. Thirdly, they have extremely rude service staff that are from Thailand who is so proud and stuck up and I read the reviews on FB many said that they are only nice to foreigners. What a disgrace. All the female staff who works there have no sense of pride, and respect to the customers. I ordered a Phad Thai, Pineapple rice and Beef noodles along with their Tom Yum soup and Pandan Chicken. Everything else is unfresh and subpar. The prices are indeed a tad more affordable but honestly, I rather pay $3-$5 more to eat fresh food from genuine staff. We walked off feeling so unhappy with the entire experience.Just to add, most places in Singapore charge a service charge so basic service like having to serve our drinks is a no-brainer. I'm never going there again because they actually have the decency to charge for service. Ridiculous.
4
A group of 5 of us came for dinner. The food was great value and delicious and we found the service absolutely fine - this is a good no nonsense place to eat. The seafood tom yum was delicious - sharp, spicy and very 'clean'. The basil chicken was equally delicious and in fact all the dishes we ordered were very tasty. The portions are small but given the price, very reasonable.There is no alcohol served here but it did not diminish our enjoyment. We will most certainly go back
3
Came here this week for lunch and opted for the pad Thai set and some spring rolls. Food was ok but a bit oily for my liking and the spring rolls were on the small side. On the plus side it's very cheap. Expect to be chased out fairly quickly once you've finished your meal
4
Basic place with great food at low prices. No credit cards accepted. Unexpectedly long waiting time for the food.
5
Authentic Thai food especially Green curry this place would be good choice. the price is reasonable and good value.
4
This little restaurant gets quite busy in the evening. Filled with locals. Located on a side street a few blocks from the Raffles hotel.
Very inexpensive by Singapore standards. Casual dining, tasty food. Highly recommended. We ate there twice.
5
Authentic Thai food in good quality :) very spicy if you wish to. I loved the green curry and papaya salad! Exceptional dessert choice (they have red Ruby :) )
Very cuddly friendly staff.
4
Me and my son ate most of our lunches here while we were attending a workshop in Peminpin. Servings are categorized into small, medium and large. The medium serving is quite filling. I liked their sea food fried rice, yummy, with lots of squid, shrimps and fish. My son had their chicken fried rice twice. The shrimp pad Thai not to my taste though.This restaurant is air conditioned, in the middle of a row of eateries.Staff are friendly and attentive.Prices are a bit higher, but still reasonable
4
If you like authentic Thai food at most afford price but do not mind the poor service then Jai is the perfect venue. For a family of 4-6, you can enjoy sea bass in tamarind sauce, curry chicken and four or five other traditional Thai dishes for within S$100, drinks and mango stick rice desert included. On the other hand, the waiters and waitresses are all Thai but somehow they are not friendly and treat customers like dirt. I guess they can afford with good price at such fantastic price
1
Having been to several Thai restaurants and Thailand often, it's easily concluded that this has one of the worse Thai food and service ever. We've ordered the clear tom yum soup, mixed platter, green and red curry, pineapple rice, fried broccoli with mushroom and stir fried beef. Tom yum soup, the staple of all Thai food, was spicy from the chili padi, without any hinge of sourness and sweetness in the soup; pineapple rice was soggy with too much moisture without a single pineapple; mixed platter with fish cake and spring roll, was lumpy. Adding to it, being the first few customers when the place opens at 6pm, the waitresses who just got up from their nap gave a sour black face to "welcome" us. Probably they came from the land of smile and left the smile back home..
4
Jai Thai is conveniently located within short walking distance from either City Hall or Bugis MRT. The food is great and seriously good value. We ordered green curry chicken, mango salad, phad thai and clear tom yum seafood soup. They were all very delicious and authentic, though I personally feel that it was not spicy enough for me (my spicy-ness level is quite high) but they are all good for most people.On a separate note, the service level is really not commendable at all. Really bad. I would say it is the extreme opposite of Thai culture.So, just for the food; this place is great. Two thumbs up
3
When you need a fix of Thai food, this place remains a good choice. This time I was here with 2 friends and we opted for the set lunch of Pad Thai which came with a simple drink in a plastic cup. Cost for 3 of us was about $25 so it was pretty good value and fairly tasty too. I'm sure I'll visit again
5
BUSY, is the only way to describe this informal Thai place! The locals flock and the line to be seated moves quickly on the weekend. On a number of visits to Singapore, we have had dinner here more than one night and have not found any item on the menu which was not wonderful. Great pandan chicken and fish cakes as well as good curry and stir frys...
3
Ate here during Chinese New Year, as many other places were closed. Food was not very tasty. beef dish was very fatty. Didn't get a stomachache from it, but that's about all that I can say.
5
Great food.
Being a Vegeterian this was an awesome place because they would substitute with Tofu.
Excellent taste and Value for money.
5
I ordered the Thai fried tang hoon and its tasty n come with 3 big shrimps , the Thai prawn cake is very special as its stuffed with tofu.. Nice restaurant in the city n served by Thai people.
5
This hidden gem is tucked in nicely in Purvis street. I have to admit that I am a fan of Thai food and I frequented this restaurant almost once a week. Their Basic Chicken is really good - and their Tofu with Basil Chicken is even better. Their Green curry is also one of the better ones. This place is usually crowded during lunch hour. I would recommend you to try this place out.
3
The Jai Thai restaurant – really a café-sized place on Purvis Street – offers tasty food served super-fast for a semi-reasonable price. I tried to choose my usual two “test the Thai” items – Tom Khai Gai (coconut milk-based spicy curry chicken soup) and Green Curried Chicken. But, the soup was done for the night, so I ordered the Fried Squid & Vegetable appetizer at S$10 for the Small plate. It was served in less than six minutes and tasted great. I would have ordered a second, but I wanted to leave room for my green curry – a good idea, since even the Medium portion (S$12) was generous and served up quickly. With the boiled rice and a Tiger beer, and the mandatory 10% service charge, the meal came to S$32 (approx US$23) – as I noted, a semi-reasonable price. My local Thai back in the good ol’ U S of A would have charged a bit less to serve food cooked by real Thai people and served in a much nicer atmosphere. Still, since I could not call them to get delivery in downtown Singapore, this did the trick
3
The food here is quite good. We had a mix of dishes today: Thai green chicken curry, prawn Pad Thai, stir fried beef, and a mango salad between 4 of us. All the dishes were tasty and the green curry was particularly good. The service was pretty poor, just a general complete lack of enthusiasm. Despite that I'll probably still come back again for another visit. We paid about $60 which is good value for money for the meal
4
A lot of people complain about the service here, but I find it sufficient for a cheap meal. Just order on the order pad, signal to the staff and they'll take it. Food comes out quick and is tasty - I love the mango salad and the thai basil beef. Always recommend this to colleagues who are staying nearby and have had no complaints from them

We went to Jai Thai after reading many blogs that mentioned this place as of one the best Thai places to eat in Singapore. In fact, the website 'thebestsingapore.com' actually includes this place in its top 5 Thai restaurants in Singapore! Top 5 on Purvis street maybe yes but top 5 in Singapore, you must be having a laugh. I question whether any of those bloggers that recommended this place actually ate here. Other than the price, everything else is just average to bad. We got to the restaurant at 8:45 and the waiters seems completely uninterested to serve us. I had to wave them down 4 times before getting any attention and this was just to clean the table and bring us some menus. We had friends visiting so ordered a variety of things. The food was ok. Nothing stood out and the Green curry was bland and lacking seasoning. If you cant get the Green curry right in a Thai restaurant then something must be wrong. Mango salad ok, pandang ok, cashew chicken lacking the cashews. Generally a less than average meal. To top it all off, as soon as the clock struct 9:30 the waiters made it very clear to us that they wanted to close the place down and for us to leave. Last time I checked, they close at 10pm. To ask to take your plates away (when you clearly where not finished) and stack up all the chairs around is not a nice sign towards your customers. Will not be back here as there are so so many better Thai places in Singapore
2
Come here for lunch with my friend. I order set lunch tom yum seafood (the content was vy little). The fried platter that contain tofu, fried fish cake, spring roll and pancake super OILY really can stay on you throat for quite sometimes.Vy bad service as waiter extremely RUDE. When i ask for fried shallot and peanut she give me chilli sauce and say 'we only have this'Actually i can see the peanut as my friend order pad thai and served with peanut
3
I ordered pad thai and pandan rice for take out. One of the waitress is very un friendly, she said "take away, go inside" with emotionless face.. Well i stayed outside.. And almost immediately another senior waitress took my order, she was not rude to me.. Waited not too long for the food, price is pretty reasonable..
1
I felt very unhappy because staffs spoke ill of me and my colleague very loudly in the restaurant. I used to like here, and I've visited here very often though.
I was disappointed by these staffs' impolite attitude, and hope that they are well trained.
1
Arrived earlier than my friends but was promptly ordered to leave as i was waiting to eat with my friends.
I was to place an order or leave. I left.
4
Good food, excellent choice, fast polite service. Don't expect top end experience and you won't be disappointed.

Was looking for an alternative venue for lunch after the initial venue was full. Walked the stretch of stalls and settled for Jai Thai. It was a modest restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. Decor was simple and pleasing. As we sat and looked through the menu, I did a search here and was anticipating bad service based on the reviews.Thank goodness everything went well and we didn't experience any unpleasantness. The staffs seemed to be Thai and may not be totally good with English. While not exceptionally friendly, the service was quick and efficient. Food went down pretty well with me, and I am very much interested to try out their other outlets.
1
This afternoon around 2pm plus, i was at that restaurant with my friend and mother. As it is a new restaurant to us, we wanted to try although we had lunch already. 2 of us ordered beverage and my friend ordered Food & beverage as well . When service staff (a lady) took our order, she asked "only 1 person eat" with inpatient tone. I guess other tables could hear it. Then i replied "we hv ordered drinks as we all had lunch already". It was 2 pm plus. 10 minutes later, she came to our table and told us "only 1 person eating, can move to another table". I was stunned and difficult to believe what i heard. Because the timing was after lunch hour, with many empty tables, that time the place was not crowded at all. Yet, she "instructed" us with an ICE face to change table. I told my friend to carry on, to excuse myself with my elderly mother. My friend followed me as well. We cancelled our order and stepped out. Staff there did not bother at all. I wonder how could they run a business with this mindset. I hv noticed that the service staff chased customers away
1
I was with my friends I order lunch and a drink. My friends order drinks and we passed the order to the waitress she say out loud only one order? She look not happy working there. We were sitting at a round table . After awhile the same waitress came over asked us to move to the other table. The customers on the other table was disgusted and all of them left. The waitress was so rude ordering us to move. This place the service is so bad. I wonder where is the management and what are they going to do to train their staff to be polite to customers. This place will surely close down soon if the staff do not treat customers well
4
We stumbled upon this place when looking for thai food in this area. The menu and atmosphere look authentic enough for us to step in.All the dishes we ordered were good - Tom Yum soup, Pad thai, Thai fishcakes, Green curry chicken. Stir fried basil chicken. The thai fish cakes are huge in portion.the rest of the dishes are of average size
2
Not sure why people are saying this is a great value restaurant. The food is overpriced and the quality is very poor. I had chicken pandan and pad thai. Both were bland with overcooked meat. Neither was particularly authentic. Staff are surly, even with a few patrons in the restaurant. When I came at noon they were sitting around a table playing cards, ignoring customers. Given the choice, go somewhere else. Singapore is full of good Thai food
4
Authentic Thai food at a very reasonable price.The Green curry us to be especially recommended.And the beer is reasonably priced too.The only slight gripe is that the. Bill was delivered before we asked for it, almost line they wanted us to leave. We would definitely gave stayed for an additional drink had we felt welcome too so. It was only 9.30pm
5
We were a bunch of 5 girls with different ethnicity and eating habits. 2 Indians , 2 Philipinos and 1 Singaporean.. and 1 person was vegetarian :)But the restaurant had enough to offer for everyone .. we had a sumptuos meal . My recommendations are 1. Mango Salad 2. Sea Food Platter .. fish cakes are the best I ever had and just NOT MISSABLE .. Mango with Sticky Rice :) Thai Specialit
5
Easy going atmosphere anf authentic thy dishes. Nice and fast service. Fair prices..always a really really good choice..Be early and check opening hours!
4
Just arrived in Sungapore , used trip Advisor to find somewhere to eat nearby. Food and staff excellent, good variety of Thai food to choose from and the staff very helpful. Definitely recommend. Purvis St is behind Raffles hotel.
4
i eat jai thai at purvis street singapore and i love their taste and i recommend you to order set menu .
3
We ended up here as it was convenient for our hotel. The Green curry was probably the best I have ever had, but the rest of the food was pretty average in terms of flavour and presentation.The service was quick, but the staff did not seem that interested in service. I guess it is really somewhere to get a quick bite, rather than a full night out
3
Seafood fried rice was excellent except the calamari was rubbery. Otherwise delicious. Padang chicken over cooked. Shrimp in tamarind sauce excellent. Cashew chicken rather ordinary and in need of ginger. Out Waitress was fast but unfriendly but another one seemed to smile once in awhile. Prices reasonable. Will probably come again and try some more dishes. Doesn't take credit cards
4
Don't expect anything too end here and you won't be disappointed. Basic set lunch of Pad Thai, a lime juice and a simple dessert for $6.80++: it's hard to go wrong! Service was prompt, the place was full at lunchtime, and food was reasonable for the price. Only real issue was quantity; probably necessary to supplement with an additional finish unless you're a light eater
5
I have been only once, but it was the best dinner in Singapore during our holidays.In fact, it was a recommendation and, for sure, I´d like repeat again as soon as possible.At Purvis St. there are a lot of restaurants and nice atmosphere. Even though we decided wait outside the restaurant for 30 minutes because it was full. There were some tables outside as well. Inside there is a small dinning room and don´t expect any luxurious, just the opposite, it is a very modest restaurant. Regarding the menu, we ordered Pad Thai and Green Chicken Curry and it was delicious!!!!The staff was efficient but not specially friendly but, who cares if the meal is so good? Even more, it was value for money
5
I've been going to Jai Thai since they first started at Thomson Plaza, Suntec City, Clover Way.... & the food has always been very good & authentically thai, especially the set menus which are very good value for te variety that you get.though, I'm not a vegetarian, I like especially the vegetarian set that comes with this red curry (this thai dry red curry is "Paneang" style) with taukwa. Not many restaurants can do Paneang the real thai authentic taste. I used to work in outskirt of Thailand & I have Paneang Chicken with rice at least once a week in a Zhi Char stall, so this is my good memory food which I only find it at Jai Thai, no where else in SG
1
We had our dinner last 29 August around 7pm and we ordered Green curry chicken, deep fried fish in tamarind sauce and PANDAN CHICKEN. The food is nice especially the green curry chicken but one thing that captures our attention is the famous Pandan chicken that is full of skin and fat that is not as we are expecting as we order the food before. We ask for a replacement of the chicken hoping that the product is better than the first but unfortunately they fail. So we have to call for the manager to complain why is their Pandan Chicken IS NOT AS GOOD AS BEFORE. The manager explain and show to us how the chicken is done which is indeed FULL OF SKIN AND FAT. We also tell HER (the manager) that we are eating here for more than a decade and the chicken is not as good as before. The manager EVEN ANSWERED BACK that their restaurant opened only 2 or 3 years ago. (Yeah, your restaurant started operating since 1999, SO THAT WAS 2-3 YEARS AGO.. GOOD IN MATH). And worse, since we cannot accept the quality of the chicken, the manager said to us... NEXT TIME, DO NOT ORDER PANDAN CHICKEN. So that's how you treated your patrons. Yeah next time... oops, sorry, there is NO MORE NEXT TIME. Very rude staff, especially the girl who took off our tissue paper on the table (WE ARE NOT DONE EATING YET!!!!!) Yeah MISS, you said excuse to us, BUT TAKING OFF THE TISSUE FROM A TABLE THAT IS NOT YET FINISHED IS A SIGN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TABLE MANNERS!!!!!) Since THAT GIRL took off the tissue box, we ask the manager to have the tissue back... Yes she did BUT SHE BANGED THE TISSUE BOX IN OUR TABLE. Nice, well educated staff. I hope you could read this... IM REALLY HOPING YOU COULD READ THIS. I wont be going back to you horrible restaurant anymore
4
I return quite often to Jai Thai during my lunch breaks, their green curry is totally addicting. I have to confess it is the best green curry I have ever eaten in Singapore. Once I tried their Tom Yum, which was very good as well, but I personally still prefer their green curry ;)The service is prompt, no long waiting times for orders
4
50m walk from National Library.
Nice Green Curry Chicken, Tom Yum, Pineapple Rice.
Price slightly cheaper than shopping mall restaurant.
5
The food there are really affordable and delicious, it really brings up delicious thai food taste that can hardly find in singapore. Must go!
5
I've been to Jai Thai a few times and they've always impressed. Finding vegetarian Thai food options in Singapore can be difficult but in Jai Thai, they do have a fair variety. I've had the Red curry, Green curry, Olive rice, Mango glutinous rice, and Iced Milk Tea here. The food is delicious and flavoursome and the portion sizes are just right. It's good value for money. The service has always been prompt and the folks here are very friendly
4
When donating blood in Dhobby Ghaut exchange, we started to think where can we eat halal, slow food here. There seems to be none except the 1Market... until my friend who went to the washroom accidentally saw JaiThai! Thankfully, it was super nice! The ambience is good, the service is fast and the food is deliciously superb!! It's one of the moment when I wish I can continuously eat without feeling full.. =D And it really lives up to it's name~ wallet friendly~ ;) Hope to get a chance to drop there again!
4
Excellent meal but very slow service , place was extremely crowded , which was not surprising as our bill for two was less than Â£14.00. Pad thai was excellent as was the mango salad .If your looking for a cheap night , then this is the place . Three minutes walk from the Inter continental hotel on middle rd .. Plenty of other restaurants on Purvis Stree
5
Recommended by ladyiron and gave myself a try. And it never disappointed us. All the food we had ordered was wonderful. I feel like i had my dinner in thailand. We love all the dishes. Will try other dishes for next visit. Yummy!!! I love Thai foo
5
We found this place on trip advisor and decided to go there for dinner. The food was great but the service was pretty average with us having to go to the counter to order and ask for a few things many times.The Pad Thai, Mango Salad and Fish Cakes were all great. We ordered the curry like other reviewers had but they forgot to give it to us and we left without trying it.Overall the food was great and we would return
5
excellent all round menu with simple and good items, the famous land of smiles service is apparent and the food is freshly prepared. try the sea food and phad thai and the fish cakes are a must. the 3 for 2 singha beer deal means that food has more wash downs and the ambience is authentic without being shabby.it has become one of our regular food points in this island of plentiful variet
4
This has got to be the most reasonably priced and authentically Thai restaurant in Singapore . The mixed starter platter was very interesting ; except for the ordinary deep fried spring rolls the rest was very tasty . They do a good mango salad. Loved the Squid in basil , Olive rice and the deep fried Tilapia was very good. Desserts were a disappointment - small portions and the rice in the mango & sticky rice wasn't cooked 
4
Chanced upon this wonderful Thai hole in the wall as we were walking down Purvis Street looking for a place to eat. The tofu with Chicken and Basil was popular and good. I especially liked the Beef with Basil and Chilli, the pandan chicken was delicious, nicely fried and juicy. Good place for a simple Thai meal. Owned and operated by Thais.
