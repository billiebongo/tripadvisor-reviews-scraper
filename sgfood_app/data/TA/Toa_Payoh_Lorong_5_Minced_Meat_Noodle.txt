Lovely noodles. One of the nicest I have eaten. Came here with friends. Had a great time. Staff are friendly and helpful

Saw their makan sutra rating + other cerificates, so decided to give it a try. Sauce of dried mee pok was diluted, and I found the noodles just like any other bak chor mee stall, nothing spectacular
