They soy tart is very delicious and worth trying. Comes with a box of 8, it's easily consumed by a family or group of friends.
Really authentic taste of soy milk and the crust is very nice.

I love their soy bean egg-tart. The "egg"tart does not actually contain egg but is made with soybean, turns out to be so aromatic and yummy. I also recommend buying their pastry sold in the plastic container packages, like the pastry we usually buy for Chinese New Year. All their cookies taste so good too. Each container of cookie/pastry cost about SGD15-18. The tarts are sold in boxes of 8s.

Moonpies, tarts, pineapple tart all homemade, our all time favourite. Reservation is a must. Or else you will need to wait 15mins at the shop even they have stock. Mostly, all is selling fast. Moonpies will start to increase price one and a half month before the festive. Original price us Sgd 13.80, this year start 18 Aug 2015 will sell 14.80, and every week will increase one dollar till 27 Sept. They provide the premier box by adding Sgd 7.I love their moonpies!!!! It is better if they could sell selective favour

This place is supposedly famous for its traditional pastries, so I headed there before Chinese New Year to buy a box of the pineapple golf ball tarts for my family.The crust is OK (buttery though a bit dense) but the filling was the most extremely cloyingly sweet we've ever tasted - it's like a large ball of sugar in the mouth. Perhaps because of the lack of preservatives the store had to over-compensate with excess sugar to keep longer on the shelf, but this is frankly bordering on disgusting.Never buying from this place again

I did not imagine the shop to look so modern, unlike the old-school pastries that they sell. It is not like a bakery shop where you take a tong and think what you want to have for breakfast the next day. Most items are kept in the chiller behind the cashier table. However, there is a display cupboard showing the available items so if you want a box of assorted slice cakes, you have to ask the lady. I grabbed one of the pre-packed goodie ($3.50) whose appearance and name perked my curiosity. "A Classic Treat from the 1960s"  This colorful retro-looking scones eh no....rock buns are sweetened naturally with the assorted dried fruits. Rest assure that these rocks won't break your teeth as you pluck of morsels and toss them unstoppable into your mouth. And tada....the legendary Beancurd tart. Without the eggy custard smell, they are still wobbly and better than having just tau hway. These are delightfully crumbly and butter, like those from Chin Mee Chin. Shaped like a deep-dish ramekin, one is enough to fill an average stomach after dinner. I feel sorry for egg tarts now because beancurd tarts beat them hands-down. ($9 for a box of 8)  Though assorted flavours sound exciting, they really aren't because they taste the same, for instance peanuts is just a few steamed peanuts tossed into the filling. Not peanut butter. Same goes for the longan, grass jelly, ginko nuts and white fungus, red bean, egg white. Come to think of it, other countries have tau hway but i think Singapore is the only place with Beancurd Tarts. Another great reason to stay here:) Visit user's blog under profile for full post and pics

Other than the signature pineapple tarts (golf ball size), egg tarts (made from soya bean milk), do try their special swiss roll (e.g. orange, pandan, blackforest), durian puffs, rum balls etc. I've always enjoyed their old-fashioned cream cakes. Staff and bosses are very friendly. There are 2 other branches at Veerasamy Road, and Cambrdge Roa
