Does more than just snacks, Miki is a handy place for folks nearby, great local food that is always fresh and tasty. Helpful staff who can help foreigners like me choose something good and the eggplant is some of the best I have ever had!

A roadside café so not flash, but the food was great, quick and cheap. Who needs restaurants.The locals eat there and that's enough for us.

Curry fish head is over rated. The rest of the dishes are ok. A place where I will visit if I have no better ideas where to eat for dinner.

We had our dinner at this place last Saturday night. We ordered Curry fish head & Prawn Paste Chicken (虾酱鸡). It's really so delicious! Must try! They having a $5 off (curry fish head) if you followed their instagram. Service is good. Just that waiting time slightly longer during peak period. We will sure come back again for other dishes next time. :

Located at the basement of the old Katong shopping mall, this hidden gem serves varieties of chinese food. Affordable & tasty, one need to try the signature curry fish head at least once. Indoor (air-cond) & outdoor seatings are available. They also have delivery services in the vicinity of their stall-like restaurant. Order some beers to go with your chinese stir-fry, or opt for some sweet chinese desserts run by an old couple next door. Highly recommended for fuss-free dining

To share a little on Miki's Snacks, it is a family restaurant that has been around for around 30 years, serving a myriad of Chinese, local zichar and seafood dishes. It offers both indoor, air-conditioned dining as well as alfresco dining options, including an eat-and-smoke section as well.We had the Salt & Pepper Pork Ribs (SGD$14.00 ) was another palate pleaser as the tender pork fillets contained hints of crunch to it. This mini flavors explosion was exquisitely balanced between the salty-and-peppery combination.Who would've thought that even simple Stir Fry French Beans (SGD$12.00) could be so delicious? These were cooked to the right texture - soft but still maintaining the tautness of crisp freshness, with hints of spiciness to them. Oh, yes, these beans came in "original" or "spicy" versions!Following that, we tried out the Miki Curry Fish Head (SGD$22.00) - thick, rich curry served in claypot with lots of ingredients. The piping hot curry was not too spicy, which should fit most people's preferences. Besides the buttery-smooth fish, there were some vegetables and tau pok (dried tofu) in the pot as well, all beautifully-soaked with the essence of the tasty curry. It was served with tantalising bitternut chips on the side.Now my favorite item - Crispy Butter Calamari (SGD$16.00), chewy and flawless with a thin layer of crust. The buttery flavor was not too strong, but hints of buttery fragrance that blended very well with the slightly-charred flavor of the golden crusts.Last but not least, there was the Cashew Nut Chicken (SGD$14.00), endorsed by shiitake mushroom cubes, onions, carrot slices etc. The small chunks of chicken were tender enough, best eaten with the crunchy cashews. Every bite was packed richly with flavor; might be owing to the delectable gravy that the dish is cooked in.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/dinner-at-mikis-snacks-katong-shopping.htm
