Had the 7-course Christmas dinner and behind every dish was an interesting concept which was explained to us. I really love the whole setup; how Christmas should be about a meal with loved ones, about familiar tastes and vibes instead of strange new creations. The chef put a lot of thought into each dish and all I can say is that he completely nailed it. Every course was tasty with a unique local flavour. I couldn't get enough of all of them.Lovely food, perfect ambience and it was enjoyable hearing the chef tell his stories (especially about the giam chye ark that led to him marrying his wife). What an enjoyable dinner.The menu:1. Good Things Start In A Trio: Sweet potato espuma with freshly grated nutmeg, Smoked duck buah keluak wanton, laska prawns on haebee hiam cookie2. The Macaroni Salad With A Difference: Macaroni with fruits and nuts in Nonya belachan mayonnaise dressing3. One Chicken Two Cultures: Fried Louisiana cajun spiced chicken breast with Chinese herbal emperor chicken soup or cranberry sauce4.The Teochew Christmas Ravioli: Smoked duck and ham ravioli in salted vegetable and duck soup (Giam Chye Ark) with shots of Cognac brandy5. The Ham Quinoa Fan Choy: Fried quinoa rice with honey baked ham and mushroom sauce6. The GUMBO: Louisiana Gumbo with prawns, mussels, clams, luncheon meat and served with roti prata puffs7. Mulled Wine and Coconut Panna Cotta: Warm mulled wine with coconut panna cotta and orange peelImpossible to pick a favourite because every dish was so delicious and unique

9 courses for S$49.00! Delicious food, value for money and friendly staff! Visiting Singapore and met up with three old friends at Snack Culture Company. Eating the 9 course dinner was fun! We were excitedly anticipating the taste of each course. As always, food got us excited and spiced up our conversation and the evening. The owner, also the chef made his tour round each table to explain the inspirations behind each dish! Innovative dishes and fun to eat! Go! Eating is believing ;
