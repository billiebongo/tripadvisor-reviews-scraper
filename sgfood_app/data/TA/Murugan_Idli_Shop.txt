Perfect location , bang opp to Mustafa. Dont miss Murugan specialty ghee roast idli with podi. Simply amazing.
5
I always visit and it is my first choice to eat food at this shop whenever I visit Singapore. Although the ambience may not be so good but food is excellent.
4
This is a typical south Indian restaurant providing meals as well as snacks which are both fresh and tasty.
1
The coconut chutney had definitely turned ! Probably from keeping it for two days.
Go to MTR instead. Cleaner and tastier.

I had been to another south indian joint for dinner the previous night and then came to Murugan Idly for lunch the next day..Murugan Idly was much better than the previous joint. It had some yummy chutneys. Butter Dosa was too good. And there MAWA barfi (Called Palkowa in Tamil) was out of the world
5
After MTR1924,murugan is the best place to go for dosa. Here positive dosa is very well prepared and tasty. Quite spicy. Good for North Indian Tourist. Another best Item here to go for is #JigarThanda, a dessert u can found no where in Singapore. U can also enjoy the nearby busy streets of Mustafa and little India. A lot of other things to try.

It is quite a small place, The seating is for about 30 people max. At lunch time, sometimes you have to wait a while to get a place to sit. The location is a bit difficult to find the first time as it is tucked into a nondescript corner opposite Mustafa.In the last two years, we must have visited this place about three times and each time we found the food consistently good and the service considerate. The prices on the menu are subject to a service charge and VAT, for which they add about 10% to the bill. But the idlis are not only soft and fresh but totally yummy, served as they are with 4 different types of chutneys. The bearer comes around at regular intervals topping up the sambhar and the coconut chutney. They do not scrimp on this account, as does MTR, who charges extra for additional sambar.Easily the best South Indian restaurant, if you are interested in only the food and not so much the ambiance
4
Tucked away into a corner on the pavement facing Mustafa Exit 5/6, it is easy to miss Murugan. But if you are a vegetarian and a 'pure' one at that, you will HAVE to find this eatery. I frequent this place, most of the times, before stepping into Mustafa to have a hearty wholesome and most of the times delicious South Indian fare. They serve not 1 or 2 but a total of 4 different types of chutneys (dips/sauces/accompaniment ) with the idli/dosas. There's the staple coconut, then the tomato(red), a green coriander and then the last and the tastiest but am unsure of its main ingredient. The Sambar is a gamble....some times its tasty..at times its like a bland dal and some times its just not happening. The idli are as soft as cotton and their 'podi' dosas add a twist to the regular and at times boring dosas. The masala in their masala dosa isn't the usual yellow colored potato stuffing. It has red chili powder and its tasty. The meduwadas are quite okay provided you get hot ones.Otherwise I've had better. The masala wadas are also worth a try. If you have a sweet tooth, do indulge in the sweet pongal and/or the jigarthanda - a less sweeter and distant cousin of the falooda. Wash down the food with hot filter coffee and have it the traditional way....served in a small steel glass in a broad steel bowl - South Indian version of a cup and saucer if you please!!! Having filter coffee from a styrofoam cup is being absolutely disrespectful to filter coffee.The staff and service is quite good and don't be surprised if you find a 'closed' board during the afternoons...they say its closed for cleaning

Idli ( rice cake) is a popular breakfast choice throughout India. Rice cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body. Murugan idli is one of the very few restaurants which serves idli throughout a day and they give 3 different chutney along with idli which is again rare to get.
4
In a place, where everything looks meat and fish, this is a clear sight for sore eyes and tongue. It was a good place to taste the familiar idli, dosa, chutney and sambhar. The coffee is good and it was good to get among known cuisine. A good place to visit when one is travelling to stack up at Mustafa. The podi idli is good too. A small but unassuming place but definitely a good place for Indians to visit
3
Impersonal service - even unpleasant . Quality of their specialty - idlis - not anywhere near what they used to be. They have lost a lot of loyal clients
5
We had visited this place with plan to eat light food. They served Dosa and Vadasambhar with great taste and three different chatni which ignited our appetite and we ended with much more food than planned. This is authentic South Indian food at little India and reasonably priced pure vegetarian restaurant. Must try this here.
3
We went there but didn't find the place to be clean, they had too less staff (may be on that day) as no body came to take orders for almost five minutes, ultimately we left without having anything and surprisingly nobody even bothered to ask why we were leaving without having anything
4
Went to try this restaurant this time, which is opposite to Gate 5 of Mustafa, near Saravana Bhavan. When I crossed this place first, I could not find any empty seat both inside and outside tables and also few people were waiting. So I went to Saravana Bhavan and had some Idiappam. When I finished shopping at Mustafa and came out, I could see an empty table and occupied it. A person came and gave a form, where you have to tick your required item, along with quantity. Like Idli 2, dosa 1 etc. I asked for plain dosa and first they came and placed a plate with 4 different chutneys and after a few mins., dosa came. The dosa quality was good and the chutneys were very tasty. They also gave sambar in a bowl. Cleanliness can be improved, though they try their best. They give plastic cup for water and you can fill yourself from the jug. I asked the counter lady that they chutneys are their speciality, which she confirmed. The prices are reasonable and the quality of food was good. They are open till 11 pm, which is a good thing
5
I throughly enjoyed the food They come with plates lined with banana leaf and 4 types of chutneys and sambhar all tasted absolutely fresh n looked hygienic end of the day tooSambhar was not spicy or watery or bland We ordered 2Ghee podi idly 2Steamed idlyGhee onion uttapa Ghee podi dosa Medu Wada Jigarthanda Plain dosa Plain uttapa ( as they finished onion ) 2 filter coffeeAll this for 56 $ onlyAll was lip smacking fresh and satisfying taste buds Wanted to try Pongal but was finished we were there around 9 pm Would recommend reaching earlier on weekend

Visited in end Aug 17. This place has some of the best Idlis that I have ever had (even in India!!!). They not only serve Idlis but a whole fare of South Indian dishes such as dosas, uttapams etc. Combos such as Sambhar-rice, curd rice are available only between 9 AM to 3 PM. They are open upto 10 PM on weekdays and upto 11 PM on Sat/ Sun. Apart from Sambhar and coconut chutney, they serve all dishes with three other chutneys which are yummy. However, all chutneys are very spicy- but I loved them all. A clean and very decent family dining place. They provide generous refills of Sambhar and chutneys. Quick and efficient service. Not very expensive by Singapore standards. Idlis cost approx SGD 4 for two idlis, massla dosa costs approx SGD 5.2. Must visit if you are a South Indian cuisine fan, esp Idli/ Dosa/ Uthappams.
3
Murugan Idli shop I A no frills South Indian Vegetarian restaurant located diagonally opposite Mustafa.The service is simple ,home grown,handled efficiently. Food fare is limited to South Indian vegetarian dishes and has a limited desert / sweet menu.Prices are reasonable. Idli and vada came with four types of chutney and additional helping of Sambar,Dosas were good.Filter coffee was as expected in a South Indian restauran
5
Came by this place for breakfast and I was blown away by the quality of the Idli and Thosai.The chutney that they provided was flavorful and went well with the Idli and Thosai.Just a tip, don't order their coffee, it isn't really that great
5
For someone who enjoys the tasty madurai murugan idli and the four types of chatnis, this is the place to go. The beauty is they maintain the same taste as in madurai with 4 types of chutnis and off course the sambar. The beauty is you get sweet pongal and also vadai. Idli lovers especially madurai murugan kadai idli lovers don't miss it
4
we had visited this restaurant for breakfast last year same time but were not impressed by the taste . but this year the chutneys , four types were simply delicious with the dosas and idlis .coffee too was purely degree .great . the taste of the chutney makes our mouth water even no
5
Nice food, perfect place for b'fast, esp if you want to escape mustafa rush in evening. Prominent visiting Indian dignitaries often seen here. Food is reasonably priced and good.
5
The best idli, ven pongal, vadai, thosai with 4 different kinds of chutney are served in this little restaurant. We enjoyed every bite of our meal and to finish off we relished on their filter coffee and jigurthanda drink. Highly recommend and will definitely return.
4
Though rates on little higher side, good food is served. Perfect South Indian taste. Could be better ambience and professionalism. Trusted place for sole veg food.
5
A little expensive but worth eating here. No stomach illness. Very light food. My personal favorites were Sambar Idli, Podi Idli, Pongal, Coffee.
5
Great Experience. Excellent South Indian food. Very Traditional and highly recommend for those visiting Singapore and on a look out for South Indian Food !
5
This place just opposite Mustafa centre in little India is famous for authentic South Indian taste. Avoid evenings and lunch hour for it's very popular so crowded.Food is served piping hot and finger licking delicious. One can also have Madrasi coffee here to compliment the maxing fare . And imagine all this in the heart of Singapore . the best sellers are variety of idlis and uttapams , Upma and dosas . You can trust this place for quality and taste . I loved rava idli here . If crave for South Indian snacks just head to this place . This is little Tamilnadu in Little India ....
4
First time eating dosha, and I love it..!! Had masala dosha and a portion of Idli. They served idli with 4 type of condiments (chutneys), I don't like the coconut one. The rest are ok.I think their masala dosha is the best. Tried in several places afterward but nothing compared to theirs. The shop was really crowded on Friday evening, hard to get a seat. Weekday nights are best times to have dinner at this shop
5
Tried many of the highly rated South Indian restaurants in singapore but none could match the food quality that this restaurant could offer. Their iddly are to die for and you should visit this place just for the idly. I've tried Dosa too but iddly are what this place is famous for. Avoid other places and visit this restaurant if you want to have an authentic South Indian breakfast.

Heard of the famous Murugan Idli shop from Madurai have started in Singapore. Had to try it, so found myself searching for it at Syed Alwi Road one evening. Went there alone. There were seats outside as well as inside. Chose to be seated inside and found a place right next to the serving counter. Being there for the first time, I was only aiming to taste the famous idlis. Ordered 2 idlis and 1 coffee. Instantly a tray with 4 different chutneys and a small container of sambar were placed infront of me. 2 steaming hot idlis were served. As the idlis were small, I finished it so fast but I had so much of the chutneys still left. So I ordered 2 more idlis. It was soft and nice. But a different texture from the one found in Singapore. Chutneys were great. I have never eaten so many types at one go before. I had to ask for the coffee and it came piping hot in the small traditional cup. Very authentic. That's the reason why I felt that I am transported back to India. The guys who were serving as well as cooking were all from India. They were chatting personal things while working. So it even sounded like India! It is costly compared to other places. Paid SGD$11.10 for 4 idlis & 1 coffee
4
A branch of the popular Chennai Idli shop, the one page menu has some great food. It is one of the best idli or dosa in Singapore with 4 types of chutneys and sambar. What's great is that they also have free refills of chutney which they give very happily. Must try the Jigar thanda a cold milky dessert
4
The Murugan Idli Shop is a must visit restaurant in Little India. They serve amazing Idli's and Dosa's along with 4 type of chatni. This place is mostly crowded but the service is quick. One must definitely try their milk peda after having a meal.
3
Both idly and dosa were not up to the Murugan Chennai standards. The service was quick but the quality wasn't good.
3
For the cost of food here, they really need to improve the quality n process of cooking. Not fresh snacks or coffee for the price paid.
5
I wouldn't say ambience is super class, overall hygenic. but what stands out is idli, if you have a taste for it, you will be blown away but softness of this humble idli, 4 variety of chutni gives you a different taste with every bite.
3
Used to go there a lot but now very occasional .. taste is quite ok though may not compare the original Madurai taste esp main Madurai specialities like idli, jigarthanda .. also slightly more salty (almost all items) .. service needs a lot more better - a bit more customer centric ... A simplified menu helps ...
4
Whenever we went down to Singapore, this is the restaurant that we will also go to.. we love its podi idli and thosai which came with four type of tasty chutney. Its filters coffee is also superb. The negative side, dont go during peak period like lunch and dinner time cos u need to wait for a lo g time just to get a seat
2
I love the food there. But service is as bad as it could get. Hygine is another issue.Especially if u are served by the ladies. Gents are still better off.Its still one of my fav place but I have decided to shy from here after my last exp yesterday.The lady tried to serve the food without and plate. Than didnt even serve all requested. Finally when I asked she just dumped the food without asking the others plate.THe worst when I asked her .. some fella got pissed and started interrupting "Talk to the lady ncely"... what does that mean?? after much argument I paid and left the place never to return again
5
Got introduced through a friend when visiting Singapore. Has become a place of comfort for authentic south Indian bordering on a ritual! !.One of the more consistent outlets. Quality is dropping a bit. .more batter and less onions in an uttappam. .And the coffee ain't as piping hot as it used to be.The pongal is still great and will certainly get back for the pongal again. 
1
Really sad to write about this place that used to be so good just two years ago! Everything has gone from bad to worse now. Just visited them last night. First, the waiters were basically unresponsive- had to keep following up to get simple orders of podi idli and ghee podi dosa. Then the white chutney was so watery it was unbelievable! When we pointed it out to the waiter, he did not even bother to respond in any way. The dosa itself came after 20 minutes, and it was not crispy or good. All in all a terrible experience. We feel sad because the idlis wadas and dosas used to be good here, and the 4 varieties of chutneys used to be a strong point. Not any more:
4
It is a monthly staple in spite of the parking and waiting challenges. The menu is not the best in terms of variety but they do serve the best idlis of all and podi that os in a league of its own. Go enough times and the staff start to become amenable. A quirky queuing system makes it even more worth the trek 
5
Little place in the midst of other restaurant. Came here as a recommedation from a friend mentioning the authentic and simple, healthy choice of Indian food. The place does not disappoint. If you are in the area stop by. The prices are great, good value!
5
I come here for lunch once a month - it is always tasty as home-made food. I have tried few other dosai places in Little India, but they are not good as Murugan at all. And the price is 5$ for lunch (dosai and coffee).
4
We went here for a yummy south Indian breakfast. Idli, pongal, dosai... Tastes, service very authentic. Strongly recommended. Won't break your budget either.
4
Been there with family as well as friends..tables are not comfortable as compare to location..
South Indian foods at its best..must try Ghee Podi Dosa, Sweet Pongal & filter caffeeee...
5
This is a gem of an restaurant in Little India. If you are looking for mouth watering south indian food then this is the place to be. The best south indian restaurant in Little India
4
I come here for breakfast everyday! The idlis and the chutneys here are amazing! The staff here are not the most professional, as they talk loudly, yet they treat the customers well.
South Indian food fanatics must go!
5
Those who know about the Original Murugan idli in chennai would jump at the opportunity to have a meal over here. Though not up to the original chennai standard but very very near it. The idlis and masala vada are just amazing. The dosas are also great. The chutnies over here are not available anywhere else. Overall a very very satisfying experience
1
We went there for breakfast on a normal day. The first thing we noticed was that the same people did different jobs. The same person who cleans tables serves food. We peeked inside the kitchen to see a very dirty place. The cashier at the fronts clothes were covered with chutney and sambar
4
Murugan Idli is a place which dishes out great dosas & idlis with a variety of chutneys at a very reasonable cost. The sambar taste is plain ok. Dont expect a great place & great ambience & good service but definitely worth what you pay for. The vegetarian South Indian lunch thali only has a variety of diffferent Rice with sambar & veg raita & pickle. If you love south indian. Give it a try
4
Murugan Idli restaurant in Little India is a family favorite for a South Indian breakfast. The four chutneys are delicious and a wonderful accompaniment to the idli and dosa. The decor is sparse and the service can be a bit too much about moving people through, but we always receive a nice welcome and our chutneys are replenished as needed. On our last 2 visits the shop was busy, but the staff was not using the upstairs overflow area. We will continue to visit this nice little spot when we crave idli with chutney
1
Owner dont have any courtesy.. We are regular customers and most suppliers know us as well.. She was asking suppliers to ask us to leave while we are eating.. Will never go again..
4
Amazing to get such great authentic south Indian in Singapore. The idli's were too good and the ghee dosa was awesome... i could eat so much more... one place to always come when you are in Singapore and you crave some good south Indian food...
5
Big soft idlis with different Chutneys is something every Indian may be looking for. It also has rice thali system. Try Tamarind rice and lemon ice.
3
Have been a regular visitor every weekend for Breakfast all i can say is that i am there for the podi idly and chutneys.The owner lady is smiling and welcoming But the serving staff is not at all good they make you feel asif they paying for your meal
4
For all ye pseudo Indians and South Indian joints (including Kaveri at the Singapore airport) who are clueless about idlis, please visit here to taste the real idlis all the way from Madurai. They are melt in the mouth. However, the chutneys and the sambhar tend to be a bit disappointing compared to Saravanna Bhavan. The ghee masala dosa was good too and so was the filter coffee
5
The name itself says its idli shop - indian rice cake balls. The restaurant just offer many accomapnyments like 3-4 chutneys and piping hot delicios sambar to eat with idlis.The dosa and cofee available here are also delicious and the service is very prompt and hygenic.service is quick and i rate 100/100 for the service and pricing
3
We had heard great reviews of this place from friends in Singapore.Since it was close to our hotel, we visited it on the first day itself. We were very impressed with the idly, dosa, variety of chutneys and the tasty sambar. We visited once more during our visit and were hugely disappointed. Masala dosa was extremely oily and chutneys were not as good as the first day and sambar was spicier. Idlis were soft though. We could not visit more because it opens at 9:30am and we were already out by then
2
Been here to enjoy some good quality south indian food, but was left disappointed. The taste is vastly different from the ones you get at Murugan. The idly is ok, the masala dosa is bad and vadas not very crispy. The great thing is the coffee which they still serve with the same taste and quality. The staff serve you at their own pace and are not bothered of your order in detail. You may even be served other stuff that you did not order in peak hours. The seating is very limited and you may have to wait for long if you happen to be on weekends. You can look at this only if you have run out of other options in little India
5
If u have a sudden craving for South Indian, don't miss Murugan Idli at Syed Alwi Road. Mastery of a craft isn't always indicated by the price tag, so in this case don't let its low cost ($1.75 per idli) deceive you. It's texture comes somewhere between a muffin and "pak tong gou" 白糖糕, and it's delicate taste will leave you crying for more. All perfectly complemented by the scoops of 4 delectable sauces on your banana leaf
5
Well....we went to most south indian restaurants in Singapore...but this was the best of them all. The Sambhar(curry) that they provide is worth tasting,it is the best in the world...yes in the world. They had the bests dosa and idli . Whenever i visit Singapore , I eat only at this palce ....5 STARS FOR SUR
5
Very good food quality & Service. Located opposite to Mustafa Mall. All south indian menu available with good test. This place very good for breaffast or you may take lunch also
3
Murugan idli shop is very affordably priced and also has very tasty food. It's staff is very friendly and the service is very efficient. The food is very, very tasty and the restaurant is air conditioned.
4
simple but addictive south indian food that i keep coming back for, esp the masala vada and rava idli
5
A vegetarian restaurant and serving staple South Indian meals the place serves the price conscious diner who is looking for great food but something that's value for money! The Dosas (crepes), Idli (rice cakes) served with four kinds of chutneys are sumptuous!!
5
Probably one of my best - South Indian restaurant in Singapore especially Karam Idly, small Uttapam are yummy. It's value for money for the entire family to have good breakfast.
5
I can't eat any other dosai in Singapore after coming to this shop. The dosai here is done right!! I love to order the masala dosai and a vadai. The chutneys served here tastes so good, and you can always ask for more!
1
Place no doubt has good South Indian food but customer service stinks.Waited for 1/2hr to get people's attention & when we were about get seated; person from counter yelled at us & gave preference to person who just had visited the place.Please choose Raj restaurant(Located next door) which has more options & well behaved people
4
Murugan Idli is really has the best Idlis in Singapore. Their Chutneys are really good, and the dosas are crispy. To be honest, nearly everything on the menus is good, except the coffee. However the customer service can be lacking at times, the staff tend to be a bit loud
4
Indian food is seriously complex to decode as the flavors in itself are so vast and distinct as you travel across the country. Hence no restaurant can claim it serves all Indian flavors.But if you want to try south Indian delicacies or rather snack items ( can be as fulfilling as dinner or lunch) this is the place in Singapore. If you can handle spice try Podu Idly or Podu Dosa otherwise stick to Idly or dosa with a filter coffee (distinct south indian flavor) or lassi (cousin of yoghurt).Been here a few times for the Podu Idly and Podu Dosa with distinct chatnis and sambar for the taste buds. Truely delicious and Indian taste
3
Came here just for the hype online for its buttersoft idlis and filter coffee. I wasn't impressed at all. Idlis were neither piping hot Nor very soft. The best idlis are when they are taken out of the those coolers hot. The filter coffee was again average. Not that aromatic.I wouldn't say it's bad just that don't go here with TOI much hopes and get dejected.One idli + one vada + 2 coffees costed 10$.
5
Amazing "Podi idli" .. one of the best i have eaten. do not waste appetite on anything else :) Almost as good as the Murugan idli shop in Chennai .. not sure if this one is related.
5
Amongst various south Indian restaurants that I tried in Singapore, this is one of the best. They have 4 different kind of sauces (chutnies) they serve with all orders. Food is good. Average price per person: 5-10 SGD.
5
One of the best ones i had in Singapore, anytime best south indian authentic food. the only issue is waiting and things just finish if you enter after 9.25PM i had times where could not get anything more to order.
5
very nice south indian food
murugan is same where ever you find its name
too many choice in murugan
small place with maximum space utilisation
4
Despite many negative reviews about this place, I really liked the food and service. This is a quick service tiffin room with really low prices and they specialise is wholesome south Indian food. Anyone looking for pampering should go to a *rated restaurant.
5
Great south indian food. If you eat the idli or any other item and close your eyes it will be difficult to imagine that you are not in Chennai but Singapore. Obviously its a bit expensive but great food and quick service hallmark of Murgan idli
2
This place is by and far the most expensive place for a Idly vada meal. The service is absolutely poor and they take for ever to serve you. FOr the price we pay, they serve water and Sambhar is disposable plactic cups. I wouldn't visit again
5
We stumbled upon this humble tiny cafe Opposite mustafa. every cafe was empty and only this is place was full. So we decide to try it. Great choice! we tried the lemon rice and tamarind rice/ both on the spot. we also tried the lentil crepe, dosa and it was nice though a bit greasy. had excellent filter coffee. ended a satisfying shopping expedition
4
I had 3 idlis and 1 masala dosa here. The bill was less than $8. Additionally, Idli and dosa tasted fresh. So did the masala inside the dosa. I was also given 4varieties of chutney and sambhar as accompaniment. Photo attached. All tasted freshly prepared and full of South Indian flavor. Place is small, so I had to wait to be seated, and share my table with other guests. Staff was not attentive as it was brimming with customers. Service was slow.But overall a very pleasant experience, authentic tasty food at very little cost to pocket. Will definitely go back when I have a craving for South Indian food. Thumbs up
1
We, the people, made Murugun Idly famous by visiting it countless times but from last two times our experience is real bad with pathetic service.We asked for crispy dosa and hot sambhar..but were served cold sambhar and disa was no where near crispy. When we asked waiter about this, he said he cannot serve hot sambhar and was arguing about it
5
Food items we ordered here was not oily and at the same time it was very tasty and served hot. Even thoguh it is crowded and bit costly these days
5
It's a great place to visit for some very soft and delicious idlis.
Served with 4 types of chutni, the idlis are a delight to have.
Must try for anyone who likes South Indian food
1
Wanted to enjoy a nice Sunday morning breakfast. The food is average at best, further ruined by the pathetic service in the restaurant. They are discourteous and make you feel like they are doing you a favour.Much better options in the vicinity
4
Have been wanting to visit Murugan's for a long,long time. Haven't been to the one in Chennai also. So when a friend suggested this in Singapore a few weeks ago, I jumped at the idea. The Idlis were outstanding!
2
I have been visiting this place since i came to Singapore in 2012...Loved the Idli's back then but over the years they have lost their touch. May be change in cook or recipes have made the food tasteless. They were famous for their 4 chutney's with every meal which use to have their own distinctive taste but now have been now watered down may be due to rising expenses or change of chef or other reasons etc but they have lost their taste and just taste spicy except the coconut one. People who are away from home/Tourist will surely like it but regulars know the change in taste. The person in-charge during lunch time (a young guy) seems to be rude and mostly replies in tone which might offend you as you might not expect this from someone in Service Industry specially F&B. Sambhar served is not hot.Avoid during rain as their Seating capacity is LOW.Hit Thanks if you like the Review and it was of some help
1
In summary - if you don't want your Weekend/day/mood spoilt, avoid the place ... I went back to this place after a long time despite my first experience being less than ideal. First, how they serve .. they serve a plate with only chutneys and then bring along the stuff you order - Idly, Dosa whatever ...I ordered Idli and a Butter masala dosa with podi... the plate was full of melted butter and the dosa was over burnt ... bad experience. I was already frustrated and the server decided to add to my woes ... I asked for a top up of chutney ... it took a long time to comeby and it arrived only when i raised my voice a bit attracting the attention of the fellow customers. Then... when I asked for more.. the server goes ... "Saar .. limited only sir". So I'm sitting with a dosa fully dunked in melted butter, plate full of chutneys I dont like and server refusing to top up the chutney I like ... man, would i ever go back. Never... I suggest you don't either if you, like me, are just trying to get a hearty breakfast on a weekend morning.When settling my bill, i mentioned my experience to the cashier (assuming the lady owns the joint), she didnt even have the time to respond ... I bet she didn't even understand what i was trying to say - so much for service. the place wasn't clean either. I was very disappointed. Next time when i feel like having South Indian breakfast ... I will choose one of the several other joints that serve better quality breakfast with a smile and care about our experience. Too bad
4
The yummy idly joint with the wonderful 4 chutneys on the banana leaf - coconut, mint, curry leaves, tomato and sambhar. Eagerly Jotted down the order on the menu sheet shared with us. The long wait queue didn't deter us and we missed no chance to try - idly, ghee podi idly, masala dosa, onion uttapam and loved every bite of it.T nagar branch was much lovelier but this joint is nothing less in the land of Singapore. The ambience is more like an Indian one, no offence meant and reminds you are in Little India. Will visit again definitely.Food - 4/5Price - 3/5 (price on menu doesn't include GST)Overall -4/
4
Go where when you want to eat proper south India dishes on a traditional Banana leaf? This is the place. Love the way they have carried tradition to Singapore of serving on Banana leaf. Another highlight is the menu and ordering system. They give a paper with dishes and price printed on it, you need to write quantity with Pencil and handover to the server.Hot idli is awesome. Meduvada is a must. Masala of Dosa is good. Filter coffee is out of the world.We occasionally stop by. The only thing that I think needs improvement is the seating management. It is a bit clumsy and during peak hours, you may not like it. And the service goes down during peak hour. But the food is fresh and taste is guaranteed
2
Honestly , this does not come close to the Chennai Murugan Idli shop . Firstly, the place is too small to take your family . Secondly, you have to wait to get a place to eat . Please don't think that it means they serve good food, actually it's not . They serve average food with absolutely rude and unhygienic servers. They were just wanting to get rid of us as it was time to close. They still had 30 mins to shut shop but denied serving food that probably would take another 5-10 mins. To an extent even reused to serve coffee . Will never come back again.

It is one of the best restaurants serving South Indian Vegetarian food in Little India in Singapore.Not only the idlis but the chutneys served along with it were very good. Other than Idlis, they do serve other South Indian food like Dosa, Uthappa, etc. The location is just opposite to Musthafa Centre in Little India
4
Murugan Idli Shop has probably the best Idli in Singapore. Soft and Fluffy with authentic chutneys. After Idli, I like there is the Dosai.
4
Definitely the best idllis and dosas in towns and a must visit. Understand they have a lot of customers and super busy but would be nice if the staff is a bit more friendly.
5
We were hungry and looking for a good restaurant. We came across this hotel and was clean and tidy. It gives dosas and other south indian food. Chutneys were very good. Would be a sure place for brakfast.
1
Need to really improve the service and treat customers as customers. The last time I went their manager was so arrogant arguing with some customer. Poor thing! However food is obviously good coz it's Murugan Idli!
4
I visited Them this week after a break and was glad to see that quality was still good - chutneys were tasty and Podi idli, dosa, uttapam and Pongal - all well made
They could do better with cleanliness of toilets and wash areas though
4
If you love Idlis and Dosas, this is the place to be. Amazingly soft Idlis served hot with various kind of chatnis (sauces). Dosas & Uttapams are great too. Fast service.
5
For the softest idlis, four different chutneys and strong coffee, go to Murugans. Their menu is limited but what's on there is excellent.
4
As the name indicates it could be misconstrued to be providing only Idlis. It is not so. They provide all kinds of South Indian food. The Idlis are soft and are provided with 3 kinds of chutneys and a bowl of sambar. Their ulundu vadai is also classy. It is very rare in Singapore to get black tea, but they had it. If the quality of the idlis are an indication I presume that their other items too would be of the same high standard. Do not miss this place if ever in Singapore
4
The food no doubt is real good if you are looking for South Indian.Very good array of dishes to explore and their trade mark Ghee podi idly and dosai is mouth watering.The thing that I did not like though was the rates listed are not inclusive of taxes.Usually in SG most of them include the GST in the price.I also found service charge additional, this is not the "Fine Dining" restaurant and I was quite surprised about it.Rest I have no complaints
4
Went there early evening last week as had heard a lot about this place from the local Indian community. Was definitely worth visiting if you love idli / dosas , a staple food of South India. A very small & simple place more like a canteen no frills. They serve on banana leaf with four different kind of yummy chutneys ( sauce) and a sambhar ( lentil soup). The idli s are sore and the dosas are crisp as they should be. Worth a visit
5
We have idle wada and dosa. Awesome and delicious food which was just for sgn $10. Little exp as pee the area but worth eating as i am a pure veg and was not getting anything good to eat.
3
This place is always crowded and offers excellent food at a moderate price. The only drawback is that you might have to wait a while before being catered to.
4
I really everything served here..
They need to look into cleanliness more, but it's a very good place to get your hands on idly and dosas..
I love their paysam -sweet rice..
5
Wow 4 yummy chutneys served on green banana leaf with mouth melting idli .Crisp dosa ......
Sambar was just to what one would rate as authentic with exact consistency
Right opposite Mustafa being centrally located
Its true value for money.
4
Very popular, very crowded as expected.
Serves everything with 4 types of chutney and one sambar.
Idli is soft.The chutney fantastic
You must try the Small Onion Uttapam. Its fantastic!
And, of course the coffee
5
This is a place to go to if you are looking for authentic south Indian vegetarian delicacies. They offer quick service, indoor and outdoor seating, and are located opposite Exit 5 of Mustafa Center. Their chutneys are too good and they keep replenishing them in your dish 
5
We have tried all the so called popular south Indian serving cuisine but loved this place the most. This place serves four different kinds of chutneys, amazing fluffy idlis, crispy dosas and medu vadas. The filter coffee too is fantastic. Just one thing to be noted is this place can be very busy on weekends and hence, there may be some waiting time
5
So I travel all the way from the idly capital to Singapore to eat them and they are the BEST. Soft idly and crisp vada served with 5 types of chutney and sambar. the best part is that they are consistent in the taste and quality
4
Murugan idli started off as a small shop in a smalltown in South India and it has now grown far and wide; all credit to the founder and the team.The USP of the place has to be the different kinds of chutneys served with the soft, mouth-watering Idlis. It is located right opposite Mustafa centre on Syed Alwi Road so the location is great.Good for a short and sweet quick meal
4
We had heard of Murugan Idli Shop during our earlier trip to Madurai. So we decoded to give it a try when we were visiting Singapore recently.The premises is nothing great to comment. Just little better than any such restaurant in South India but it had a long list of people waiting to enter. So we thought there must be something about it hence we waited. And it was worth the wait. The Idli and Vada was most fluffy and soft that I has eaten recently. The dosa too was excellent and is a must have. The bill was a song---extremely reasonable. However the washroom was not up to the mark it shoud be improved
5
Excellent place to try out authentic idli , dosa and uttapam. They offer 4 diff kinds of chutneys with idli which i liked a lot .. Quite hygenic and well maintained restaurant . Highly reccomended
4
Limited items but taste closer to south indian quality.No meal service.Late opening hours.best place in little india.
4
As with most restaurants in little india,  cramped for space. Menu options limited for dinner time. Good varieties of chutneys were available but 2 of them tasted very similar , room for improvement here. AC runs very slowly and just not enougb on a crowded day limited. Pongal was very nice ..so was podi idli. Location is convenient to get . Overall value for money.
1
The service is horrible to the core.. They r not bothered if the customers are waiting.. After waiting almost half an hour when my turn came, the waiters inspire of seeing my table full of dirty plates dint bother to clean it.. Not that the waiters were busy,, they kept looking at my table and simply ignored.. They only serve foreigners good.. Horrible place.. I will never visit again.
4
I feel bad going to Murugan's idly. The idlys are crazy expensive. At 2+ dollars a piece, you can easily spend 20 bucks a person for a nice breakfast complete with some vadas and filter coffee.But man are the idlys divine. Its a guilty pleasure we indulge in once in a while. The restaurant seems like any other simple restaurant in Singapore with cheap tables and plastic chairs. They are clear on what their value proposition is - and it is tasty, hot, fluffy idlys and dosas
4
This is a hole in the wall restaurant that we regularly visit. The idli and dosa are the favourites. The service is courteous but not professional. Set your expectations right before the visit, the food is what's you're there for and its well worth it. Maybe crowded at prime time, so could take you 5-10 minutes to get a table
5
The menu is similar. The decor is based around plastic. You get 4 chutneys on a banana leaf even before your order arrives. Idlis rush out immediately. This place was exactly like what I was used to here in Chennai. To me and my wife, it was a haven when we were tired of experimenting with other options in Singapore.It will be noisy. Servers will be rushing around. The cashier won't be able to handle peak hour pressure. But the food will be reasonably priced and taste very good. Soft and moist idlis are their specialty. The dosas are not bad either. I'm surprised they aren't busier
4
I am a regular visitor to South Indian restaurants and my staple item from their menu is Dosa. The dosa is something that should have enough crispness and at the same time, the taste to carry it along to your buds. I have tried dosas almost everywhere in SG and I can say that the dosas in Murugan idli and MTR are the best ones so far. Today my review is on the butter masala dosa on offer at Murugan idli. This by far is their best offering on their menu and really makes a repeat visitor. The dosa is crisp and the masala is of good quality. Their 4 kinds of chutneys are a great incentive as well particularly their coconut chutney. The price is decent and definitely a repeat optio
4
If you are looking for the best place to try Idly and Sweet Pongal in Singapore, this is it! Idly is served with 4 types of chutney's and sambhar. Soft, fluffy and hot idly's leave you asking more.Sweet pongal made in ghee is a must try for anyone with a sweet tooth. I keep visiting this place just for this one item
2
Just good food can't make up for a bad experience. If you go to this place please be ready to be treated badly by the staff.. I really like the food here but forced to write this review after multiple disappointments. I visited alone and waited for 15 mins before the table got empty, but the table was given to 3 people (it was a table for 4).. And the staff don't even have the courtesy to tell me to wait for another 5 mins! This has not happened to me once but multiple times... And as I said just good food is not good enough. I m not coming here again and I gladly suggest to visit MTR (another restaurent) instead of this place which is 10 mins walk from this place.
4
Referred by friends visited Murugans Iddly shop for dinner and thank you maintaining that unique South Indian way.
Though with limited space and in waiting, worth and value for money.
4
True to its name Murugan Idly services some yummy idly. Visited here with a friend. Very near to Mustafa. The chutneys are awesome too. A Must place for idly lovers.
5
Simple, small menu. 3 kinds of dosas, idlis, and some rice dishes. Drinks menu is even smaller.
The shop is famous for its idlis, although the rest of the menu is excellent as well.
Pure vegetarian.
5
the steaming hot idlis,the four varieties of chutneys and the neat and clean environment make me go again and again to this place.the pongal, the dosais varieties are also very good.
4
One of the best masala dosa I have had with coffee and peda at low price. Bill amount 10.5sgd.But they need to keep place tidy and dry.
5
Get the best Pongal and Idlis at rock bottom prices. Best time is for breakfast or evening dinner. Chutney is meant for Indian palette.
5
Fast service, good taste, the staff so not cheap of giving the chutney. one of the best dosai I've ever taste
5
Great experience from food to the service - it is an experience one must have.Although, not a very big place but food is truly awesome.Once you enter , you will get an order form and a pencil to Fill-up order. Then within no time hot idlis with 4 different type of Chutney will be served to you.There can be some waiting time though
4
Awesome food. Only problem is the rate. I had 4 idlys, 1 vada and 1 tea. They charged me 17$ which I feel is expensive. If you are craving for South Indian food especially idlys and vadas and you don't have any budget, this is the best place to go
3
Quite a let down from Chennai outlets. Not kept clean. Non functional wash rooms, wash basins and tissue dispensers; especially in the first floor and soiled clothes made to dry anywhere is just like you find in roadside dhabas in India. A bad publicity for hygiene in India especially with non-Indian patrons. Taste of food is good
5
Super soft & fresh idlies. Great variety & taste of chutneys. The onion uttappam is to kill for, and the filter coffee is not to be missed...what more would you eat in a meal!
5
best place for break fast if ur in singapore & that too in little india area, u get n nos of cutnis & a nice filter coffee.
2
I have witnessed downfall in service in almost all places, not sure what's causing this decline.... Food was average ... Service was non existing ... Can't recommend this place to anyone
5
This Place holds the place for being the best south a Indian food joint in Singapore by popularity . The staff is attentive , service excellent , prices very friendly , top cleanliness and location unmatched across from Mustafa . A must visit .
4
We had 3 varieties of dosas&all were good.
Podi ,masala&ghee everything was perfect in their own way.
Sambar vada I was not upto the mark as they simply put vadais in hot sambar.
Chutneys were so good & fresh.
1
My Murugan experiences has been below average. I have been here thrice and each time the staff has been highly volatile, inhospitable and down right rude. Be it seating you down, taking your order or updating your order, they don't know how to interact with customers. They would either constantly rush you through your meal or ignore you and make you wait forever. The only silver lining is that the idlis are consistent in taste, just like Mc Donald's standardised burgers
5
A party place for idles and dosas. First a plate comes with 3 types of chutneys. Then you order your snacks in numbers and not plates. You can order 3 idlis etc. the sambar is good. The idlis are soft and delicious. Their famous cool drink Jigarthanda is also quite good but very sweet to my liking. It's a snack place and no mealsThe coffee here is the BEST. A highlight of the visit to this restaurant. Must visit for all South Indian food lovers.
4
A great, cheap, clean and wonderful place to try authentic South Indian cuisine. Idlis are very tasty and it's served with 4 fresh types of chutneys alongside sambhar (lentil curry). Various dosas, uttapam are equally worth trying.I would strongly recommend to anyone who's looking for a health, fresh & a pure vegetarian Indian cuisine
4
Murugan Idli is a small restaurant, the kinds where office goers generally have food in india. It serves great value-for-money south-indian food, obviously on banana leaves :). We happened to order sweet pongal for dessert which was totally awesome. It was dancing in ghee and no wonder was so heavy that all 5 people could just finish it after having very satisfying and stuffing main course
4
This place is very good for South India preparations like Pongal, Sweet Pongal, Dosai and Uttappam. Ironically, the quality of the idly in the singapore branch is just about ok. Nowhere near where good quality Idly should be.Also, sometimes their coconut chutney tends to smell stale. Of course, this was only once during my many visits and I would rather give them the benefit of doubt
5
If you want to try good south indian food (specially idli and dosa), this is a very good place.
They serve it in a very traditional way on a banana leaf.
Price is very cheap. (like 5-6$ for Dosa, 2-3$ for Idli)
5
This is the one of best places in Singapore to try South Indian fare, and my personal favourite. The idlis and the cocount chutney are out of this world! Even the ghee and butter dosas are damn good. Two thumbs up!
4
If you are a foodie and just love south indian food this is the place to be..While the name sounds a little funny but mind u taste makes it an apt place to visit..
5
The dinner i had has made an unforgettable pinch of south indian excellence though i was born and raised there. It was just those tender idlees that will make you feel blissful and chutney's just mindblowing-Mouthwatering
5
Liked:
Quick service
Food tastes just like in Chennai, India
Reasonably priced
Disliked:
Nothing in particular
5
Yummy Idlis and south Indian food. Very authentic join; not very large in size. On days you may even have to wait for a table as it is so popular.Just bang opposite Mustafa shopping centre, in Little India, so you can hop in to get a taste of the yum when looking for a break after shopping
5
I had been to Murugan Idli Shop in Chennai so I was familiar with the quality and taste of Murugan Idli Shop but at at Singapore I found it more fantastic. We Indians in general are very particular for the taste of food and when we travel to other countries finding food is one of the common problem but at Murugan Idli Shop the taste is as good as we are having South Indian food in Chennai. During my short visit at Singapore I went to Murugan Idli Shop three times. A Must visit for South Indian food lovers
5
Nice restaurant ....... I have never eaten such soft idlis anywhere else...they also serve different variety of chutneys and their sweet pongal is a must try if you have a sweet tooth.If you visit this restaurant, I am sure you would come out with stomach full and blissful :-
5
Authentic South Indian flavours in Singapore. Make sure to try the podi idli, as well as the perfectly crisp dosa. Only place I visited in Little India that was serving more than two chutneys. A little pricier than the rest (2x idli & coffee for $7.50) but worth the investment if you want the real deal
4
We are found at Murugan every Sunday morning for breakfast! I love their idlis and pongal. Their idlis are undoubtedly the softest I have eaten in Singapore! I would have given them a 5 star but for the fact that they dont serve Masala chai which is my fav drink with idli
5
Heavan for Vegetarians & South Indian Food lovers
Must try items @ this restaurant are:
a. Ghee Dosa
b. Masala Idli
c. Vegetable Uttapam
d. Filter Coffee
1
They add dal flour in chutneys to make it look dense. Surely overpriced taking advantage of the location. They still serve coffee in thermacoal cups! Saying no staff. Yucks!!! Totally profit minded.
4
The place is one of the best places to eat tiffins. I like their varieties of chutneys. The areas of improvement are to have food available in the menu advertised. Also expand lunch menu to dinner menu. The problem here is for dinner menu, there is only tiffin varieties available.Need to add more
4
I have been fan of this place for its hot steaming Idlis,Ghee Dosai,podi masala and meals can end with either filter coffee or jigarthandaIn my last visit I ordered for 2 adultGhee podi idli s$2.20Masala dosai s$4.70Ghee dosai s$4.50Uttapam s$3.60 Total S$15+17% tax Good points:Best south Indian food in SingaporeCleanliness is maintained.Different chutneys are yummyUnlimited healthy sambar n chutneysImprovement needed:Overcrowded most of the time(specially between 8pm to 9pm) They have upstairs also but never opened.Staff is rude n management least bother for customers.Uttapam size is getting smaller;)In ghee dosai ghee taste is almost unlike before ur hands with full of ghee.Idlis I feel overpriced But despite all I will recommend to give a try
4
Idli was one of the best I have tasted in Singapore. I also had a Masala Dosa which I felt had the perfect amount of crispiness. Restaurant is clean and air-conditioned, perfect to escape the Singapore weather. Staff weren't as friendly as what you'd find at other Indian restaurants but they weren't rude either. A bit on the expensive side but well worth it
4
I've eaten at Murugan easily about 50 times, during my 5 month stint in Singapore. 4 insanely delightful chutneys, and brilliant ghee pudi dosa. The only drawback is the occasionally rude staff, which is often so because of the sheer crowds there. Wish the restaurant was a little bigger. Great place to visit for a satisfying meal after Mustafa-shopping
3
Wanted to go here since I am a healthy food lover and Idli proven to be one of the most healthiest Indian food option. I walk into this restaurant at 2.00pm for a late lunch and following is my honest opinion:1.) Service - Sucks (no body smile, have the attentiveness or have a welcoming face)2.) Cleanliness - Good, I would say based on the food counter and washing area3.) Ambiance - Very plain like hospitals canteen5.) Food - 5* and this place definitely serves the best Idli and vegetarian option6.) Price - OUT OF THE WORLD; They charged SGD14.00++ for 8 Idlis that known as a pre-prepared cuisine. It is not like you have to even sacrifice an effort even to bare min level of frying Mee Goreng or Fried Rice. This is exorbitant price. If this is the price then they should command more than a good food and provide an experience for the customers. I guess the owner aspire to Millionaire within few years of opening this restaurant. Above is my summary and if any of you crave for a good idli then you all can head down. Office lunch crowd - you guys can look for somewhere else
5
Guys, just drop there to have the wonderful idli with multi color chutneys. Fast I can never forget. I had the same taste when I visited them at Chennai few years ago. Purpose of the entrepreneur who started Murugan in India motivates me to visit this place.
5
This is a small restaurant - quite often one has to wait to get a seat. But the wait is worth it because after you are seated, you are treated to one of the most mouth watering idlis one can hope to eat. Other items like Dosas, Uttapams etc are also very tasty. And the varieties of chutney on offer make for a good complete meal
4
I have been to murugan idli in chennai and wanted to try it again in Singapore . This place is right opposite Mustafa centre so one can do the shopping in afternoon and come here for lunch which is what we did .The place was pretty crowded inside so we decided to sit closer to the street on the outside . The way to order is the server will give you a menu and pencil you simply tick and mention quantity of what you want . We ordered idly , Podi idli and Podi masala dosa , coffee and jigar thanda (must try ).While the main server took our order another came with plate which had a banana leaf . On the plate were 4 kinds of chutney (made of lentils and coconut ) and added to the variety of things you can eat your idly and dosa with .Then the main server got us our idly and dosa . The idly was the softest and the very kind anyone will love . The dosa also was awesome . Service is good and quick and you can ask for more chutney or any other things you want to order like I saw people reordering idli Once you are done you pay at the counter . Won't recommend the usage of toilet at this place rest is all good .Will surely go next time to try other things on the menu 
5
Loved this place. Had a simple tasty meal, that was very representative of Southern Indian cuisine. Fully vegetarian menu. Amazing value.
4
Me and my friends went for dinner and we had all South foods. Especially Podi Masal Dosai was very nice and yummy with 4 different chutneys and it was a good dinner........... People can try it is good.
4
Being here several times, very close to mustafa centre. Good food but sometimes service is not good. depends on the person.
2
Meal taken away before I was half finished. On a 2nd visit, 3 groups that came in after my friend and I were seated before us.
5
truly feel great by eating Murugan Idli . Best taste with price tag. truly felt I am eating the idly in india. Must try if you are in Singapore. Thumbs up
4
One of typical south Indian restaurant in litte india near Mustafa center - Idli's are most famous here - I had tasted multiple dishes there during my dinner - Taste is good and price is competitive across multiple india restaurants over there -May be little improvement in service is required - Worth a visit here for one of your meal
3
The idlis and dosas are tasty and worth the higher prices that you pay here compared to similar places like Komala Vilas, but the service is slow and surly. I think the waiters gravitate towards those who they think will tip generously, the counter staff are poker faced and unfriendly.The floors are littered with food scraps. Not just the tables but the floors must be swept after each patron has finished his meal but the tables just get a quick swipe with a dirty cloth and the floors are not cleaned. It won't be long before the Singapore Health Authority downgrades this restaurant
4
visited this eatery atleast twice in my four day stay, food is as usual tasty, prices a 50 cents more than the others, crowded most of the time, staff sometimes get a little irritated with the guests particularly on ignorant guests, for sure single patrons are finding it difficult to get a seat as the design is meant for a four seated group
5
This is a Singapore branch of Chennai based restaurant chain. They serve pure veg South Indian food.The food is great as breakfast, lunch or dinner. They serve food on banana leaf. They serve 4 types of chatni + 1 sambhar (like daal). All south Indian varieties are great but you can't miss the following:- Idlis - very soft - Malagapodi chutni- a pinch of khaki powder + few drops of oil to be eastern with main dish like idli, wada, dosa etc- Sweet Pongal - ghee rich, sweet and hot mouth watering delicacy Ambience is ordinary, food is great, price is less.Great value for money to
5
In the bustling mustafa lane you have this modest little shop that sells hot steaming idlis with four different chutneys and sambar (all of which are unlimited). it is not just the idlis but the dosas and uttapams which can just make your day. the only problem with murugan is that one always has to wait and the other is that they have limited options on the menu.having said that, whatever they do serve, they make sure its fantastic.Tip: always insist on sitting in the inner section, getting the guy to serve you chutney while sitting outside is a tas
4
Softest yummiest melt in your mouth Idlis served with piping hot Sambar and an assortment of four lip-smacking Chutneys! Never mind the basic infrastructure as the food more than makes up for it.
5
Being here several times, just love this place for its fresh south indian dishes & specially the different variant of chutneys they serve.
Will be back again n again
😊😊😊
5
This place is famed for Idlis and Jigardhandas.
Loved the chutneys and sambhars they serve, I always end up eating more than usual.
Best place for South Indian tiffin and must try in Singapore.
5
This is definitely the place for South Indian food in Singapore. Best Idly and Chutney collection in Singapore! Can have a meal for 2 at SGD 12-20.
4
Very good south indian food at very reasonable price. Please do not expect a upmarket ambience as it is a quick food place. Clean and tasty are the key words.
4
We have just moved to Singapore in Dec 2014 and went to MIS for a quick bite. Amazing idlis- as good as you would get in a good South Indian restaurant in India. They serve 4 different chutneys and each of them is distinct in taste and flavor. Though I feel that the variety is not much (didn't find Neer Dosa or Mysore Masala dosa etc), whatever they serve is great to taste and mid to high on pricing. Top your meal off with a filter coffee and you will get a true feeling of a hearty South Indian meal. Definitely a must visit
3
The food here at Murugan idli shop is quite tasty compared to other similar restaurants although it's a bit overpriced. Also the fact that the servings are quite small is another drawback. Famed for its chutneys, Murugan idli shop is specially for those who do not get to eat South Indian food often. I must tell you that the chutneys were quite col
3
This has been a favorite of mine for the past 4 years....but off late I find the quality of food is going down and the prices going up...service staff is getting lazy and casual...without realizing the customer eating in peace they all keep conversing loudly or start having their meal with loud conversations... That is getting strange ...hoping to have them get back to their original taste and service
4
I had heard that Murugan Idli had moved from close to Race course road to walking distance of Mustafa Centre. So before embarking on last minute shopping, I went to Murugan Idli, you need to turn left before Mustafa Centre, go past Mustafa, continue straight after the next cross and Murugan Idli is the third shop. I eat idli and dosa, enjoyed it thoroughly. I must it was a satisfying visit
1
Very disappointed with take away. Instead of masala dosa only dosa packed. Instead of 3 medu vada only 1 is given. Early morning on weekday when there was not much crowd even small take away order is messed up. Once I realized at home and called - manager suresh did not have any explaination about it. No longer murugan cares for customers. Very disappointed
4
Great food! Especially the idli and the curd rice. The staff are extremely friendly. Very clean restaurant.
5
Very nice and caring people,we went for breakfast and were given very good service, have variety of South Indian chutneys including for Jains, South Indian coffee is a treat.
4
Best part is it's location as just opposite to mustafa but on most of the day you have to wait as they have limited space to sit down.Variety of chutneys is yummy with idli or dosa, you will get rava,masala, plain dosa and those set thali meals, also have desserts. I find sambhar should have more spices when they are serving the authentic food as it is quite bland .Filter coffee is so perfect though I am not a coffee lover but love this one.Price is reasonable
4
Had an early evening Supper here. Service is super fast. Great flexibility in ordering as you have to pick a Quantity of your choice from a sheet of paper. Exceeded my expectations.Masal Dosa was a little on the spicier side. If anything the Hotel can do better by providing an ambience just a touch better than the current on
5
If you want to know how authentic idlis, dosas or vadas should taste, this is the place for you. There is no other place (atleast in Singapore) that even comes close to the quality, texture and taste of these amazing feather-light melt-in-the-mouth items. Also, these are served along with an array of 4-5 chutneys on a banana leaf and sambar. (an additional star just for the banana leaf :) ). The price is quite affordable and the location is convenient.I highly recommend this place to all and gaurantee that you would not visit it just once
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the meal here.I am a very hard to please in food matters and honestly, everything I ate here was superb. Be it dosa, idly, sambhar or vada etcIf you are a fan Indian South Indian food and you are in Singapore, this is the place to go to! I promise you, you would not be disappointed.Average ambience, but it did not matter.Service was very good. would I return? Yes, definitelyDo I recommend? yes, for sure.If my review was helpful, please remember to click on the tab "yes, this review was helpful
5
Was there last night for dinner with a friend. Ended up ordering the usual suspects - Idli, Vada and Dosa. Enjoyed them. Must try if you have not been to any of its outlets in Chennai where the stuff is more authentic and tastier. Bitter ending - the waiter asked us to leave as people were waiting which was a 1st for me. Have been here quite a few times. That aside, the food did not disappoint
4
Murigan Idli shop is the one stop shop for all idly lovers in Singapore. The idlis are served with 4 different kinds of chatni . The sambhar is not the typical, it is the Tamil Nadu sambhar with a lot of lentils and is thick, the Vadas are also soft and fluffy. The Ghee Pongal - A porridge of lentil and rice is always piping hot and delicious. The filter coffee is good to but the strength is not consistence. The last time we wnet there the coffe had a milky taste. The menu is not extensive but for a soft fluffy idli ypu can never go wrong when u come to Muruga
3
I'm always wary of visitors to Singapore from certain countries who tend towards hyperbole. Idli were a little better than average in Singapore but not a patch on Tamil Nadu where we've been. We had three idli, three butter dosa with a bottle of water as they serve only that and soft drinks. The bill came to $17+. The place had a greasy, canteen-like, not especially clean tinge. Not going back for that price. Better off at a coffee-shop
5
Murugan here continues the timeless traditions from Madurai and Chennai in offering the best idlis on this planet. They are just melt in the mouth. I do not know their recipe, and do not care. I just wish they would open more branches in more cities. I was here for morning tiffin, and at 9, the place was already packed. You sit at the table, fill up your order on a slip of paper, and wait for the food. It starts with a banana leaf on a tray filled with 4 different chutneys and sambhar. Then comes the idlis and whatever else you have ordered. The medu vada was crisp and soft and piping hot. The ghee masala dosa was excellent except for the masala, that was just over cooked dark colored potatoes. It was just not the typical dosa masala. if you order any dosas, order it plain and skip the masala. The sambhar and the chutneys were just perfect, with a dose of heeng and no overdose of tamarind, the way it is mad ein Chennai. This is not a Udupi joint, so all the Gujus and the Bombayites should stay away. It is not for you. It is for the serious connoisseurs of idli and the tiffin cuisine. Eat with your hands be transported to heaven! All at prices that are unbelievable

No one can beat their soft idlis and tangy sauces with it... Superb superb and just superb... If you haven't had this, u hav had nothing in little india, singapore...
4
I like Murugan idly in Chennai so I went on trying it in Singapore tastes same but overpriced when compared to other restaurants $1.75 had to paid for idlis which seems to very expensive but the taste is still unmatched
5
The restaurant has a limited South Indian Food Menu. Try the Idli and the plain dosa. Idlis are so so soft amazing. and the plain dosa seems to be made in pure ghee / butter.
try thr white and green chutney
5
Have had many times, consistent taste and best idli s and dosa in town !! Both outlets serve consistent quality and service is quick and efficient. Sometime staff is dealing with many orders and requests, by being a bit patient and considerate is the key to enjoy a good meal.

Just back after an Idli meal at Murugan . The soft idli is not the kind of soft, which melts in your mouth. It is softer then other Sg idlis , but still not comparison to soft idli in south India. The sambar and chutneys have a kind of taste, which I never had before in my life. Other then the coconunut chutney, others were not to my liking.MTR is still a better choice
5
The food was served on banana leave ( on a tray ), four chutneys (yummy food) and hot sambhar. Sambhar and chutneys are served as you come and your order is taken later, its was a bit different then the way orders are taken in India. I ordered Idilli and Dosa, the Idilli was soft and dosa was crispy. The food was served hot and tasted fantastic. The four chutneys they served are wonderful . One can also find other Indian restaurants nearby
4
Had super idli was soo happy idli was soft and very tasty, they gave 4 chutneys along with sambar yummy, had onion utapam was good but too oily, my husband had plain utapam which was also yummy with full of oil, dont eat if your too conscious but I guess once in a while is ok, sambar vada was also tasty. Felt it was a lill expensive when compared to other tiffin centres in singapore but again worth the taste.I would definitely recommend if someone is craving for some nice indian tiffins
4
If you enjoy nice soft Idlis, with aromatic sambar and a variety of chutneys -- This is the place to be! The food is great, as a result, it might be crowded at times. Dosas are a bit oily, but are good and crispy. Service staff never failed to pay attention when your side-dishes are empty - they will promptly refill it for you.The place itself is a bit small and crammed, and like an average restaurant style. 5 â˜…s for the food
5
We went for evening snacks to this place. We had Uttapam, Dosa, idli and Coffee. The food was really tasty, hot and authentic. This is the best place to have south Indian food. The service was very fast, the cleanliness was maintained very well and the staff was courteous. However I felt that price is bit on the higher side, but after having such a wonderful south Indian food I was fully satisfied with the restaurant
4
We are a regular visitor to the Murugun idli shop because of three main reasons-basic south indian food with subtle home cooked flavor, fresh ingredients and cheap price. They make the best idlis in town and I personally like their utthapams and pongal. We have tried almost everything in the menu and nothing disappointed us. The place is a bit small and unkempt. Its the kind of restaurant where you eat and leave. It can get really crowded during peak hours. You should also not miss their filter coffee-its strong, bitter and refreshing.A good place to have a quick dinner/lunch after a claustrophobic grocery shopping time at the Mustafa's.A small advice: watch out for the spoons they serve with food, the sharp plastic might scratch your mouth
5
I liked the varieties of chutnies. Their food is very good and reasonably priced. I am yet to taste some of their meals which is served during day time.
5
We had Idly here. It came with 4 Chatnies. We loved the taste. Presentation was really good and rate is reasonable. It is very near to Mustafa center so location wise it is good. Service was good. Recommended....
5
A clean, airy restaurant. Don't expect posh ambience - it is just a simple dining room. No fancy menus, just a simple order form which lists all the food items available to order with a box next to each for you to indicate what quantities you want for your table. Next comes a tray lined with a clean banana leaf with 4 types of chutneys on it and a bowl of sambhar. And then the food starts coming from the kitchen item by item and is served to you directly on your tray, like you would be served at home! I have to say the idlis are the best I have ever eaten in a restaurant. And I have eaten at a fair few, including in the deep south of India. Soft, white, fluffy, melt in the mouth. The medhu vadas are golden and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - heaven. Not twice fried, like most restaurants would do as they fry in batches and re-fry when ordered - yuck! Ghee dosa lives up to the flavour you would expect from a great, thin, delightfully brittle dosa. Overall, a simple but outstanding dining experience at cheap prices. Highly recommended when all you want after eating in all the great restaurants in Singapore (which are set in superlative surroundings!) is a simple, home style meal
4
The restaurant is pretty small, everytime I visit I have to wait for about 20 mins to get a space, the idli is awesome and they have 3 different kind of chutneys which is yummy,The restaurant is a bit expensive but the quality of food is superb
3
The food's consistently good despite the menu being limited. The idlis are nice and soft, the dosas hot and crisp, and the chutneys are wonderful - they have 4-5 different kinds plus sambhar. The service gets a little slow but the authenticity and quality of the food pretty much make it worth it
4
I have not had this authentic and delicious south indian food even in Bombay. We had steaming idlis, crispy dosas and wadas but have heard almost all food is good.We went on a Sunday morning and getting a table was a little difficult, staff wasn't too cooperative about the table arrangements
4
I went here with my family. It is a very basic and simple concept restaurant where the waiter beings you a plate with 4chutneys and a bowl of sambhar.yummy chutneys.sambhar was average. We ordered vadai and dosais and they were very delicious. We will definitely be going back again for the food. A bit on the pricier side though compared to other same sized establishments
1
recently i was there to try out some idlies after some shopping at mustaffa. i went to this place and tried the food ,2 pcs idly and a plain thosai.i got a shock for the first taste which entered my mouth..the gravy was very watery,,no taste and the chutnies was soo terrible, the coconut chutney was about to spoil.it was a total bad experience.I was soo dissapointed that i left the food paid and left.i told the cashier about the bad experience..... she was like cannot be bothered.i will never ever step in to this eatery again.The food is not cheap either
4
I have became a fan of south indian food since my first visit to murugan idli shop. Hot idlis and flavored rice are must but dosa and utthapam were not upto expectations.Ideal for pure vegerarians like me who got ample choice in menu(for a change)Average price per person sgd 10-15
3
During my stay in Singapore, I wanted to taste South Indian food.A native there took me to this Restaurant to taste its Idlis, for which it is famous.We went early in the morning for breakfast,even before it opened, so as to avoid rush. They took their own time to take the order. They took a lot more time to bring the ordered items. Hence, service is not prompt and waiters are not cheerful with the advent of customers. As regards the food i.e. Idlis & Dosai, it is just so so. The cost is exorbitant. We get much better stuff and at a lesser price in Chennai. Even though, there is a rush for this Restaurant, it is only due to the eagerness to taste the South Indian food and its brand name. It is a small & ordinary Restaurant serving routine South Indian food, which can be visited once in a while with family and with lot of patience. Don't dare to visit it when your stomach is rolling with hunger
5
Quick service and great food! Almost missed this place while walking around Little India. Another no frills restaurant with awesome food :)
3
well its not as great as the one in chennai iteslf...but i cant give a miss to dosa and filter coffee for many days....so had to visit murugun in singapore..indeed a satisfactory meal
5
They have good options in breakfast. The food in healthy and very tasty. Idli, dosas and coffee were really awesome!!!
Keep up the taste and hygiene you guys are maintaining.....
4
The best idlis I've had in Singapore! Much better than what you get at Komalas, Sarvanna Bhavan or Ananda bhavan.Muruggan serves it with four types of chutneys and sambhar. The idlis were soft and hot when served unlike other places I've tried where they are generally served cold.For idlis this is one of my favorite place now!Don't expect anything much in terms of ambiance and service, just go for the food
1
After I trashed Saravana Bhavan for serving F&B with dead insects, I decided to visit this place. Dejavu. I found a much bigger dead fly in the food that was served. At least the waiters were apologetic and got me fresh plate. Food is okay, and not as good as what everyone raves. I personally prefer MTR. While I had kept this place as an option, I'll no longer be patronizing them
5
Little India has so many Indian restaurants, but my new favorite restaurant for breakfast or lunch when I am hungry for South Indian food is Murugan Idli Shop. It's located on Syed Alwi Road, just beyond Verdun Road, right across from Mustafa Shopping Centre's 2nd building.When we ate here right before the lunch time, it was already packed. We shared a table with a Tamil man, and we had a very pleasant conversation. Good food makes everyone happy!We ordered Masala Dosai, Idli and a few different variety of Vada. It comes with 4 types of chutneys on a banana leaf, and a cup of sambar soup. They are very tasty. The service is fast, and everything is clean.I will be tempted to eat something here, every time I come to Mustafa Centre now
4
Place is always super crowded and has some waiting time... but worth the wait if looking out for some authentic south indian foods such as idli, dosa, vada, etc... service is super quick too and runs like a factory sending out dosas by the minute. Tables and ambience is poor but who cares the food is tasty and price is not too bad for Singapore. A good eat 
4
While there are many places where you can get South Indian food in Little India in Singapore Murugan Idli is by far the best according to me. Tucked in a small corner opposite Mustafa in Syed Alwi road Murugan Idli offers good idli, Dosa and pongal at affordable prices. Try the pongal and idli her
4
Me and my hubby liked the soft idli's and dosa's and the 3 types of chutney and sambar. I loved the tomato chutney and coriander chutney very much. Even they also have lunch items like mini meals and variety rice. A tastier food for our money we get but not satisfied with the service 
4
My wife and I really liked the soft idly with ghee, sambar vada and filter coffee. The chutneys were very nice and ghee dosa was as crisp as it can ever be. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try idly and dosa for the first time or is yearning for South Indian tiffins. This is definitely not a place for having a romantic dinner. Don't even pay attention to the service or you will get disappointed. Just go there with Idly and Dosa on your mind !!!
4
I enjoyed the hot idlies with spicy sambar at this eating joint. A very good option if you are a pure vegetarian. Even tea was amazing.
4
Murugan's is a good place to eat before, in between or after a shopping spree at Musthafa's mall in Singapore. A smallish restaurant but with neat, homely ambience, their idly, dosa, coffee breakfast is excellent. One also gets excellent vada, pongal etc at Murugan's.
5
Modest looking Murugan Idli Shop dishes out authentic South Indian snacks with mouthwatering taste! The service is polite and brisk and families are welcome. Price is very reasonable. A must- visit in Singapore, for sure!!
2
The food is expensive and they have limited choice of food. Service is good. You can get better food at komalas
2
Murugan still has the best idlis in town. Fluffy and fresh, if a tad expensive for a very non-pretentious setting.But the service has gone steadily downhill over the past decade, and has now reached truly abysmal levels. I understand that Murugan is not fine dining, and I visited on a weekday evening so it’s possible that I encountered only second-tier staff, but they were truly pathetic. You'll reach the place, stand around, and not be approached by anyone. You must rush to a seat the moment it is vacated – that’s the only way you’ll get food. Then, you'll spend half of your dinnertime trying to grab the attention of the waiters. I’m sure Murugan can afford to hire an extra waiter or two, or train the existing ones. And they could open the upstairs area (which, bizarrely, is always closed despite the crowds) to accommodate more diners
4
Murugan idly shop on Syed Alwi Road, just opposite Mustafa in Little India is a great place for wholesome South Indian tiffin cuisine - go here for dosa/idly/vada/ uttapam, and curd/tamarind/lemon/tomato/sambar rice, apart from the coffee of course.It’s clean – Grade A. The food’s consistently good, and we’ve become regular customers. With hardly ten covers, it’s a cosy place. What we ate: The masalas dosa is fresh, crisp, very long (!) and not greasy - served with sambar (home style, ****) and four types of chutney it's yumilicious. The mini meal with curd rice, sambar rice and tomato rice served with kachumber (onion/curd mix) and aloo sabzi and accompanied by dessert is more than a meal for one.And what value - dosa and mini meal for 12 SDInteresting aspect: at lunch time there's at least one person on tour from India digging into the food. The conversation with the host is a formality, for the hero of the moment is the dosa followed closely by the smart phone.What’s disappointing: the filter coffee served in disposable plastic glasses - sacrilege of the highest order
5
This restaurant runs on some SOP (standard operating practice) and has a grade A ranking from Singapore health-authorities in terms of hygiene.We have been there several times and were never disappointed. Start with a Idli or two, go for the Masala Dosa and top it up with coffee. The prices are about 30%- 40% higher than similar eat outs in Singapore but you will never be disappointed with quality. Opens at 9 am. They now have a branch at race course road next to Anjappar under the shop houses that is relatively empty
5
Great place to enjoy South Indian favorites like Idli, Vada, Dosas and Uttapams. Really good food and fast service. The sambar could have been better but the chutneys (4 of them) more than make up for bland sambar. No charge for extra sambar and chutney - something that sets this place apart from other joints I have been too
4
We have been to this eatery many times every since this place opened a few years ago and is always our go-to place when we are seeking reasonably priced and homely idlis and dosas. The idlis are outstanding and so are the 4 delicious chutneys they serve alongside in unlimited quantity. Dosas, vadas and pongal are excellent too. Finger-licking good. The service is generally very good though during busy times e.g. weekend evenings, the service may not be that great. This is not a place for ambience (which is very basic) or for wide variety of eating options (menu is limited), but if you are looking for hot, fresh, delicious and very satisfying idlis, dosas, vadas, pongal etc, this place will not disappoint
4
We were living on staple food from Komalas while on a five day trip in Singapore, till we happened to notice Murugan Idli one road behind our hotel Grand Chancellor. Our first impression on breakfast was that breakfast was very homely. Then we had takeaway for lunch and on another day we had dinner. Enjoyed all the meals, would rate this as one of the best Veg joints in Singapore, even with its limited menu
4
The poongal and vada tasted excellent. The 3 different chutneys and sambar was being topped up regularly. There is so much crowd that it might take time to find a seat!!
4
If you enjoy South Indian meal and are around Mustafa Center then this is a must a visit place for having lunch, dinner or some snacks.. They keep on refilling sambhar and chutney. Don't go for the ambiance..Just enjoy the food.
5
These are best idlis ANYWHERE. The utthapams are also really good; and the masala dosa has superb masala. The service is, hmm, "innovative", and presentation (and dips) leave a lot to be desired: but the idli are truly superb.
5
any one wanting to have south indian food especially idlis there is nothing like murugan resturant . it is near mustafa and small place. extremely clean and have south indian coffee also. dosas are ok .
4
I missed the opportunity to visit the MIS while at Chennai, so naturally when I found out there's one in Singapore, didn't give it a miss. Their steaming hot idlis are perfectly cooked, saambar (gravy) was runny as it should be for idlis and they have variety of chutneys. If only they have chicken or mutton curry, I'll be enslaved at this place for their food. MIS are vegetarian only shop
5
This is a South Indian restaurant serving vegetarian food. The vadai, sambhar and chutneys are delicious. They are also generous with the sambhar and chutneys. The decor is simple. Expect long queues. My only complaint is that while they serve the food on banana leafs, they serve drinks and condiments in plastic cups/containers
3
This is one of the most authentic south indian food places in Singapore. However there is no ambience and seating is very basic. Food is quite consistent but for a basic small Idli (rice pancake) to be priced at S$ 1.75 (Rs 76) for a single piece, takes the fun out of having south indian food here. A basic meal for 4 people can easily set you back by S$ 50 +
5
I am obsessed with this place. An Indian friend brought me here before a Mustafa trip, and I am forever thankful. The idli are divine, though the star for me is the Masala Dosa. I commonly make "mmmmmmmmmmm" noises with my eyes closed, and the staff get a kick out of that. They refill my sambal and sauces, which is good because I dip a lot. I just love this place. My favorite Indian Veg in Singapore
1
Go here only if you are willing to pay for below average food with abysmally poor service. This used to be a great place to eat when it had opened a few years back but now it is one of the worst places in town. Perhaps they did too well in the initial years and this has made the management complacent. Clearly the management now has the sole objective of making money rather than offering an experience which will bring diners back to them. The size of the idli's has gotten smaller and smaller over the years and the prices have risen steadily. One would have ignored this had the service standards been so good as to offer a good dining experience. But the less said about the pathetic service the better. The waiters are clueless, orders are not prioritized on first come first serve basis and the staff response is rude when they are asked to speed up
5
Not only does Murugan provide the best south Indian food in Singapore, it has something rare in Indian restaurants: quick, efficient and friendly service (are you listening, Komala's?). Murugan easily has the best "idlis" in town. A great place to stop for breakfast in the morning before you head out to the stores in the vicinity
3
Murugan Idli shop, Chennai is my most favorite eating place but the one in Singapore doesn't match up to the Chennai ones... In fact, in Singapore I prefer Ananda Bhawan to Murugan...
5
Authentic south indian food, which tastes almost close to home cooked food. The varieties of chutneys, the sambhar, the dosas are all just awesome.
5
One must visit it to savor the best idli and yummi dosa. Do not forget to end your meal with filter coffee.
One must not care for service and ambiance for the food they serve.
5/5
5
I went there for the dosas and I will keep on going....
5
HOT idlies Super delicious ; Medu vada & masala vadas served hot : dosas all kinds super: 3 type chatnies & Sambar ,all are too good .let me tell you we vegeterians have any way limited option,if you have a option like this,its' a bliss
2
Folks,I am writing this review for Indians...Indians here i mean people from India. If you have not tried any Idli in life, than go here. If you have tried Idli before, than Avoid this. Singapore Indians have forgotten the real taste of Idlis after eating Idli here.They dont cook at their kitchen and always come out for food. Looks like most of them dont know cooking. I would say at one shot for people coming from Indians on Tourism. Why do you people want to try all these Indian food again in Singapore ? You have tried enough in India..If you are on Honeymoon, than go different. 1 Idli costs $1.75 dollars. The chutney is so bland and..Yuck. Coffeee was also very bad. Dont die to eat here. Just have your breakfast when you come across here and move on on your trip.Food is not that great in Singapore. People do not remove veins from Prawns here..So ugly !
5
This is another place which I have been waiting for. Its such an irony that I have to visit Muraugan Idli in Singapore. Idli was so hot and soft, just melted in my mouth. The 4 varieties of chutnies and the sambar were too tasty, was just finger licking. Had asked for an extra sambar bowl and drank it like soup.The only issue is an idli costs 1.75 SGD, a tad too costly. But not to complain or to offset the experience
3
For a reasonably priced lunch or dinner this will be a good place to have a meal along with your young kids. Can't say the service is that great here though as the many staff members here speak very little English. Usually occupied by Indian customers, the vegetarian meals here especially the hot idilis are fantastic. Great spreads of different chutneys here for you to savour and appreciate. The outlet is a little uncomfortable though as you will have a feeling as if others are watching you here to finish your meal fast to facilitate other waiting customers to take over your seat. Other than that, all is well here
1
i went for a takeout with my father.We ordered 6 plates (12 pieces)of Idli.Since both of us were there,waiting for the food to be packed,i ticked for 1 piece of Idli for Dad and 1 piece of Vada for me.The waiter said not possile,minimum 2 piece.So i had to explain as if i was breaking a religious rule,that we werent really hungry but sice we were here,wanted to have a nibble. He still refused.I asked for him to call his Manager. The Manager came read the rule to me! I explained 6 plate pack,we not hungry...blah blah. But our attention was again drawn to Rule number....ya you got it!. I cancelled the order and we walked out. Never again,there are many better places on the same road with polite staff and humilty in the management
4
Their idlies are the BEST ever. Butter soft. They serve 4 chutneys with this (non-stop) all of which are hot and delish! I always order the oil/podi combo to kick things up a notch.Their sambar is the TN (Tamil Nadu) style. Their filter coffee is said to be excellent too. (I don't drink coffee)The rice and other items are nothing to write a review about.Best to visit off hours, can be extremely crowded otherwise
4
If you miss home food, murugan idli shop will set it right for you :-). The food is great, the dosas are just the way they make them in chennai. Spicy curry with Idlis, yum! The Mysore dosa is worth trying.
4
A small joint but serves the best idlis and dosa. Recommend for any tourist
4
This is THE place in Singapore to have authentic South Indian idli sambar and other dishes. Not the cleanest of elegant of places, but serve great food.
3
I'd heard a LOT about this place since i came to Singapore. As we were in Little India, we decided to try this place this weekend. The place is a small joint, like a cafe, and hence you might have to wait in queue during the rush hours.We ordered Idli, Wada and Onion Uttapam. Idlis were soft and fluffy, exact same way my mom cooks. So yes, i liked them. With the other two items, i was not much impressed. Wada was a little too oily and uttapam just tasted average. Sambar and chutneys can be called for refill without extra charge.We wished to have tea, but they don't serve it yet.Overall, i would prefer their neighbors Ananda Bhavan or Saravanaa Bhavan
5
Go here at least 3 times a month. Have been a regular since the last 6-7 months. Great food. Awesome value and clean environment. Dosas, Idili, Pongal, etc..you get to perfection like i am used to in Chennai - Vegetarian food. Highly recommend the same!!! Must go at least 1 in two weeks..
5
We were four and tried atleast 6 dishes. All of them were excellent and mouth watering. The presentation and flavors are excellent. The manager out there is very humble and ready to help with every minutest detail. They also pack the food , if u want to carry it along with u. Overall too good, if u hv strong liking for south indian food specially IDLI and WADA. Thank
5
Like the heading says. If you want quick, sure cheap and awesomely tasty south Indian food, go there. *Anything* else, this place doesn't give. The staff are friendly, but not that we'll trained. Te food is satisfying, satiating, but not the most hygienic. But come on, just because it's not a fine dine doesn't mean it deserves a bad rating. After all, the name includes 'shop'.So once again, the next time you want to taste the most amazing Idlis with the most amazing coconut chutney and a full meal for two under $20, goto Murugun Idli 'Shop'. If you want finesse, best look elsewhere :
5
At Murugan, you can find the best idlis and chutney money can buy in Singapore. Soft, fluffy, Murugan has become really popular and crowded since it opened here. Be prepared to wait for a long time during rush hours. Dosas are great as are the rice items. Amazingly tasty as they are, this is not a place if you are a weight watcher. Enough of ghee supply in the food. But tastes great! The service could be a bit better and wish they kept the place a bit cleaner. Extremely noisy as well, all adds to the flavor I suppose
2
The signature idlis are indeed good though equally good stuff is available in Little India. The premises are cramped and dingy, the service staff brusque and untrained, and the prices about 50% higher than comparable restaurants in the area. Don't go upstairs because the food will be stone-cold by the time it's served
3
The idlis are very fluffy and the other food is pretty good as well. I just have a big problem with restaurants serving food in styrofoam and disposable utensils even when you are eating in. Awful environmental practices. There are plenty of other South Indian restaurants in the area that serve equally good food and don't do this.
