Slow working-business lunch in a lovely atmosphere.Tiptop service in an understated way. Nasi Goreng was to die for, 10/10. No wifi yet, which will drive some customers bonkers, but who cares. Will be back.

Great food, excellent service and reasonably priced. Worth the visit if you want a quick delicious meal

The lunch menu is a set menu from which you choose whichever main and side sets you'd like, for SGD 9.90. Soup is free flow. Coffee or tea is included, and the included dessert is a scoop of ice cream. It's easy to order and served by efficient, friendly staff. My chicken chop was a little salty, but the experience was great, especially because there wasn't a crowd

They used to offer $8.90 lunch sets that comes with a free flow dessert (Usually Red Bean Soup). Now they increased the price to $9.90 but they now throw in free flow soup of the day and ice cream. Add on salad bar access at $4.90. All prices before GST and Service Charge

Had the set lunch - chicken chop spaghetti with mushroom sauce. Had eaten some spaghetti and had a small bite of the chicken chop n realised that the Chicken chop was not fully cooked. Waitress took it back and after a while they return me my half eaten spaghetti which was already cold , and only the remaining chicken chop was hot. Apparently what the chef had done was just re-cooked my chicken chop.Felt disgusted that such a restaurant in a hotel with good review would handle uncooked food in such a way, instead of re-serving a new plate of food. Probably the set lunch I'm paying is too cheap for the restaurant to re-serve another new plate

Our office is just bear by and time to time we popped up to petite for lunch. For reasonable price you get Main course with drink and desert of the day which really worth it. Menu is changing every two weeks so we not get bored over a year of eating there.

We were staying up the road and popped into this restaurant for dinner one night. It was absolutely lovely from the service to food and wine. On that basis we returned for breakfast a few days later and it was dire. We were told by the waitress that it was a Buffett with 10 min left and no more food would be brought out. Fair enough we thought so we paid the money and went to the Buffett table. Our feet stuck to the floor with so much food dropped and not picked up around the restaurant. The heaters had all been turned off the food and so everything was stone cold. Upon picking through the devastated and cold remains of the Buffett table we attempted to sit at a clean table with napkins and cutlery. However the waitress said we couldn't sit there and redirected us to a filthy table and to go up to the Buffett table and get forks from there. At this point I had enough and told the waitress I would like a clean fork. Her answer to this was to put reserved signs on every clean knife and fork set at clean tables. Ending this extraodinary experience was the male manager wandering in from the kitchen and eating left over food from the buffet table while guests were still eating. My advice would be to go to this place for dinner but avoid breakfast if you like hot food, good service and clean fork

Breakfast in this hotel restaurant at AQueen Hotel, is available for an extra payment of ca. 12 SGD but it is not realy the money worth because some basic things are missing if you also have European guests, like cheese ect. The politness of the staff is also not realy there. We was 3 persons ordering a lunch incl. a drink - coke for 7,50 SGD, but a coke light had to be paid extra, so i choose a meal without any drink. The waitress brought after 9 min 2 meals, but nothing for me. So asking her, she was not able to understand what we wanted. And i told her, that now i did want any meal. She turned around with any appologize and no smile throughout the whole session we was there. Her english was also very bad, and i lokked like she not wanted to work, as well as her collegues. The food my friends had, was nearly without any taste, and the dessert was crashed on the table, it was very goood to see, that she did not want to serve us

We visited back this resto this month and we are all satisfy with their new set of lunch, compare to our first visit in July. Before it was so petite (small serving) but now they bounced back with more satisfying new set of meals and good desserts. Price are just so reasonable and in budget. One of the selections we pick every week for our lunch place

went back to petite menu with my RI buddies for 7pax dinner on 8.4.2014. kind of soon as i just had a great dinner here at petite menu on 22.3.2014, but enjoyed just as much. we all decided to take the S$36 4-course tasting menu since it featured the restaurants’ signature dishes. it came with the lavendar pumpkin soup, smoked duck salad, a choice of mains = pan-seared seabass or chicken leg confit, and the deconstructed blackforest.we asked if some would like to try the ribeye, they could top-up the S$5 difference (ribeye was S$20 & the seabass & chicken confit were S$15 on the menu). the restaurant was under no obligation of course to consent to our requests (& we were ok if they were unable) but for this time they agreed. so 2 took the chicken confit, 1 took the seabass & 4 had the ribeye.#1 this the second time i had the lavendar pumpkin soup. everyone agreed the lavendar fragrance was overpowering (like eating perfume) but the soup turned out to be quite good when eaten with the wakame seafood. the crunchy granny smith apple balls added some unusual texture. everyone quite liked/didn’t mind it. #2 smoked duck salad – duck was good (a bit salty), tomatoes good with mesclun salad & some dollops of creme fraiche.#3 the chicken confit (rather unusual) looked & smelled excellent, and came with purple cabbage & pumpkin puree. 1 friend said it was very tender. #3 the pan seared seabass with quinoa salad was also par excellence! i thought the taste & texture of fish was very good (usually seabass has mud taste & falling apart meat texture), the foam, the flavour of sauce, the artisan presentation which enhanced the flavours & dining experience made it on par with most fine dining restaurant standard. #3 the ribeye was a large serving for S$20, but it was quite disappointing. i had a very good onglet (hanger steak) here at last visit & ribeye is a better cut than hanger steak so i was expecting better. the cooking was actually ok, the browning (searing) & the medium rare doneness were ok, but the quality of the cut was not great. 1 friend left 2/3 of the steak with tendons etc though i finished mine completely. also the seabass was very good here so i would not order the ribeye next time.my friends were impressed with the dessert. the deconstructed blackforest was excellent. we ordered 2 servings of kaya toast to share & they all liked it too except 1 friend commented the helping was too small c/w the blackforest.the bill came to S$48nett pax, including 4x top-ups & 2 extra orders of kaya toast. everyone was full & happy! see my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2014/04/10/return-to-petite-menu-on-8apr2014

Visited menu for a lunch with the family, giving us an opportunity to try a large variety of dishes. The presentation of each dish was absolutely amazing. In particular, I loved how the Pumpkin Soup, Late Breakfast, Kaya Toast and of course, the Black Forest was presented. An absolute beauty to behold. It's important that taste matches up to presentation - no problems here whatsoever. The sweet pumpkin soup was perfectly balanced by the brilliant use of a salty seaweed salad, bringing together a blissful combination and enhanced with nuts for a great overall texture. The Late Breakfast was an ingenious concoction - a buttery brioche, with the center emptied out to fit in a perfectly cooked egg, surrounded by a truffle-dressed salad and topped off with lovely bacon and amazing baked Parmesan. The crowd-pleaser Chcken Confit did not disappoint: it's almost hard to believe that chicken can take on such a pleasing texture and taste. My Torched Steak was a really good portion size for the unbelievable price, accompanied by an intensely good mushroom pesto. I could go on and on, but everyone should drop in and taste the food for themselves. Firstly, there is no where else in Singapore you can find such beautifully presented and prepared food, at this price. The enthusiasm and creativity of the chef is apparent in his work. Given the number of over-rated restaurants and chefs around charging stupid prices for mediocre food, this is one chef and restaurant who really deserves a pat on the back for delivering. Go try Petite Menu ASAP!

You would not usually equate cheap with good. But this was so good that the price was unbelievable - you can consider it EXTREMELY value for money. The food, the presentation, the taste - all of it, would be that like a fine-dining restaurant's. Except that the ambience and setting was more tone-down and more like a casual restaurant. Located at the lobby of AQUEEN Hotel, the ambience was not too shabby either. It was quiet and nice when we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, though the food service was a little slow. However, all the service from the staff was very pleasant. I guess all good things are worth the wait, and when the food was served, they kind of blew our mind with the taste and presentation. We had the chicken confit and pan-seared seabass as main course, the lavender-scented pumpkin soup as the starter, and the vanilla panna cotta and kaya toast mille feuille for desserts. Prices for each dish were all below $20 / $10. Yes, below $20, for such artisan food! I will definitely be back many many many times and I hope they wont raise the price when more people goes there or if it becomes too popular.Note: It is located beside Singapore Caskets, a funeral service shop, but there is nothing morbid about the place as it is along the main road. To get there, it is nearer to take the train to Farrer Park station and walk, than to take to Lavender MRT station. We took the train to Lavender and realized it was a good 10-15 mins walk, whereas after our meal, we took a walk to Farrer Park which I think could be done in less than 10mins

Petite Menu is my favorite restaurant since 2013. this place is an addiction, serving quality and quantity of food for a fraction of a cost..The Creativity and quality of the Chef and his Kitchen team can be seen by the intricately thought over fusion taste of food. Their meat is always done to perfection, and the truffle-ed puree is amazing.This place is nestled in a charming precinct, away from the hustle of the city, a gem indeed.Returning for my weekly affair

The ambience of the restaurant is very cafe-like, despite the fact that it is a hotel restaurant. In the morning they serve breakfast buffet, but what truly brings out the character of the restaurant is their set lunch and dinner menu. Fine-dining style food is served and also at an affordable price. For 2 pax, each with a main course and soup, you are looking at around $20-$25 per pax. This restaurant is worth the effort to locate and travel to. The only problem they face is location. Hope they can relocate their restaurant to other places

Absolutely satisfied, definitely will be back for more.Very reasonable price for akin to 5 star fine dining display of food.From starter to main to desserts.Can't wait to go back again.Have made reservations for Valentine Day

It was a different kind of feel you get from other hotels. To me, all other hotels had the same course the same feel but Petite menu gave us a different feeling especially with their very special and delicious Chicken Confit and their amazing creation Black forest dessert. The place is very comfortable and heartwarming. I would recommend more of my friends to visit Petite menu in the future for sure. And will be looking forward for more new menu creations. Thank you chef
