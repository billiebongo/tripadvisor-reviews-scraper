It is a good value deal And the food presentation and quality is of high standard, although it is being prepared by the students of Temasek Culinary academy..
Reservation required in advanced.

I always love frequenting places where young people are being trained in their chosen profession. The food here is good quality, good value and the service (mostly) excellent and always pleasant. You have to watch out for the special few weeks when service goes public and the culinary students can strut their stuff – and it is a popular time so book early! A special shout out to John Storm (Adjunct Instructor—Hospitality and Service Management) with whom I had a long and interesting conversation while all the time he kept an eye on his charges …. I will be back
