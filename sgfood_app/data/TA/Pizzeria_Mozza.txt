I have been here several times and consider it one of a handful of places I go to for delicious pizza. Sitting at the counter and interacting with the staff enhances the overall experience.
4
Always make sure you book here.
You could construct dinner out of a series of small plates here kind of tapas style, fried potatoes, cauliflower friya and beetroot salad were all excellent
We shared a white pizza for the main
Really impressed
5
I've been here so many times, with friends and family and I have truly enjoyed the food. They have so many different types of pizzas and pastas! The quality of the food was really great. The staff were hospitable and friendly. The location is obviously great too, being in MBS. Overall, I have always had a great time here and I am looking forward to coming back
5
Was greeted by attentive hostess immediately guide us to the table available. The pizzas was good ! And the service was great as well, server ms nora was there assist us on avolcado because we didnt take the bacon crumbs, would be back for sure !

Brussel spout on pizza isn’t something we see often so we ordered one and it was delicious coupled with pancetta. We also had another pizza with anchovies on. Both came out great. Service was good and we loved the table paper mats showing different things in Italian. It was an interesting read.

I am a huge fan of Chefs Table on Netflix and one of the standout features in Season 3 was Nancy Silverton. Her personality and passion alone will drive you to try one of her creations. While visiting Singapore I found out that she has a Mozza at the Marina Bay Sands so of course I had to snag a table. The cocktails were well executed and the build out of the space was beautiful. The wood fired ovens behind the pizza counter were a nice touch as well. The pizza is delicious, we got a garlic heavy pizza and everything was so fresh it blew my mind. Do yourself a favor and give Nancy a chance to show you what she loves the most and that’s bread. It is the best.
5
My wife called in there for a meal and was well taken a back by then place. They soon sorted us out a table even though it was very busy. Obviously a popular place. The thing that really made it such a good place apart from the excellent food, was the very attentive staff. It wasn’t a case of not being able to do enough for us, but they were genuinely lovely friendly people. Well worth a visit
3
I was disappointed by the pizza (Napoletana) and would not go back for that. Yet the plate of cold cuts we had was delicious.Service was great - very friendly staff.Location is too loud/ noisy for me - not a place for a cozy dinner
4
We needed a pizza fix after a week in Singapore, and this did not disappoint. Located in the gigantic mall adjoining our hotel, the place is bustling till late. We got seated quickly, and decided to try one of the many delicious sounding pizzas, and an order of garlic bread. All food items were very good and arrived in a timely fashion. Service was professional and friendly. For a change, cocktails were priced less than beer or wine by the glass
3
Heard about the place so went down with a friend and you have to make a reservation as it does get busy.The pizza was average definitely not wow in my opinion. The staff were friendly and attentive
4
No complaints about the food or service (we were in the bistro section). It’s very expensive, but I’d be happy to recommend it for people who don’t mind paying over the odds.
4
A nice restaurant in Marina Bay Mall,
The staff very nice and helpfull, good athmosphere,
Right inside the mall and close to Marina Bay.
5
This is quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had in Singapore. Seated at the bar top where you can see the chefs making the very pizza that you just ordered. Expensive, but really worth the experience too.
5
Lovely pizza whilst sitting at the bar. Friendly staff and great cocktails. Found in the main Mall on other side of Marina Bay hotel
5
I love the pizzas here! All vegetarian options are great barring the pizza with tomatoes only. The beetroot-horseradish salad is good too; just request the waiter to add less oil if at all. The aperol spritz go well with the food!
5
Really liked the food here. The pizzas and staff are great. It was crowded and we did wait for a bit, but the staff was very accomodating and we eventually sat at the bar. They also have the Osteria side, but we chose the pizza side as it looked more exciting. No sign of Chef Batali......hmmmm
4
You will not be disappointed! There are many choices of pizzas in the menu for you to choose from. I particularly like the one with fennel sausages and bacon, although some of the other varieties are just as good. An order of a pizza is probably sufficient for 2 to share and this would allow you to order some starters and/or salads. Try the chicken wings, they are delicious and definitely one of the salads in the menu. Service here is good too. To avoid the disappointment of not being able to get a table, it is probably wise to make a reservation as the restaurant can get very busy during lunch hour
4
Stop there for lunch after some shopping in the marina bay sand mall. The restaurant is divided in two. On the left side an osteria with typical italian food and on the right side a trattoria with a more simple setting. The osteria decor is sophisticated and more expensive. They are closed for lunch. The trattoria is a lot simpler with wood tables and chairs. No tablecloth. The menu is mainly pizza with a good variety of appetizers. Not much else. Wine list is ok. Only a few bottles with a price below 100 SGD. If you want you can ask for the osteria list. Ouch ! Service is to fast, you have to slow them down. We went there around noon. Within 20 minutes the place was full with a lot of local workers. A good sign. The food was good. Worth the visit.
5
First time visit of this pizzeria, menu is a bit difficult to read as it’s all in Italian. They have a translation page though. We ordered a meat lovers pizza, and the crust is thin, crisp yet tender. You still want to eat it after a few pieces, can’t stop!
4
This restaurant has 2 parts, a restaurant and a pizzeria.It’s busy with locals and visitors alike.We had a salad, a pizza (meat lover) and 2 glasses of red and 2 macchiatos — the bill $128 pretty stiff but it all tasted good, although the pizza had little meat and the salad was very small— I’m not sure in Marina Bay where you will do better, but the prices are steep for what you ge
4
Gourmet Pizza well above average and unique to Singapore.Located in Marina Sands Bay Shopping Center complex a Vegas type venue and over the top in activities-shopping, dining, entertainment. Service excellent and a great place for a casual meal.
4
Went here for dinner in October 2017. The three of us had an excellent dinner at the bar. Of course we all got pizza. The food was good, nice atmosphere and we all remember the attentive service. Would go back if we return to Singapore!!
4
Service was quick even though the restaurant was full . The prosciutto pizza and chicken liver bruschetta were excellent . The ricotta stuffed flowers were too funny .
5
In many places, pizzas are only about the toppings. But this one is special, the dough was amazing, the toppings were fresh, feels like having an orgasm in your mouth.
4
The only reason I am not giving this pizzeria five stars is the exorbitant price of the wine! To pay over S$90 for a bottle of wine is daylight robbery! Even Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask! Yes, I know it was an Italian wine (+ a very good Lacrima di Morro) and it came all the way from Ascoli Piceno in the Marche - a town we know well! But really, this same wine can be bought there for under Euro 10! Anyway, the food was superb. The complementary crispy foccacia was lovely. We shared butternut squash + bacon bruschetta to start with - wonderful and so different from the norm! My husband's pizza was fennel, mozzarella and scallion - delicious! I had the salame piccante with red chillies - I loved it! The service was friendly and efficient. I would recommend this restaurant very highly, but a word of advice - drink water
4
We had seen Nancy Silverton on Netflix "Chef's Table" and found that pizzeria was in Singapore so we booked and made the journey. We started with the roasted beets, bufala and horseradish. This dish was fabulous and the contrasting flavours really made it stand out. For main course, we shared a pizza with prosciutto. That was good. And to finish off, we had three scoops of gelati - olive oil, pistachio and rum and raisin. My favourite was the r&r followed by the unusual olive oil. All in all the dinner was super. I'd recommend a reservation as the place was full. For a Monday night too
1
Visiting Singapore with my husband for a vacation we were referred to go and have lunch at pizzeria mozza. What a mistake that was!!!! They advertise the best famous pizza in the world, as very regular pizza eaters I can confirm they are the worse, absolutely terrible!! We ordered a pizza and were very disappointed as were all the entrees we had. I also ordered bruschetta, a piece of bread that came saturated in oil. I would advise people to never try this place, very expensive and disgusting!
5
Whenever we are visiting Singapore we try to make a "pit-stop" at the Mozza's conveniently located inside the shopping mall at Marina Bay. My favotite topping is Parma-Ham with Ruccola. It has never disapointed me. In fact there is a Mozza's restaurant in Monaco and we went there this past May to try their pizzas. Singapore won easily
5
From the stable of celebrity chef Mario Batali, this lovely restaurant is for me arguably Singapore’s best pizza. The place is lovey and vibrant. The staff super friendly and efficient. Meal started off with this sublime Burrata (with olive oil and pesto). We had four kinds of pizza and each one was superb - crab, prosciutto, ‘meat lovers’, and margherita. Each one was overflowing with toppings and made with care. The gelato desserts were some of the best I’ve had in Asia. It’s not cheap for pizza, but the ambiance, the service, the portion sizes, and the impeccable food make it more than worth it.
4
We booked a table earlier in the afternoon and we're pleased we did as it was really busy. We ordered a couple of pizzas and a beer and a wine. All were good. We managed to say no to all the attempts to get us to order more than we wanted, and were pleased we did as the pizzas were substantial enough. A good spot, but nothing fancy
4
The chicken wing is very moist and it has a bit of spicy and sour taste. But the pizza is just okay for that price to pay. 😕
4
A great lunch was had by all,while out shopping we felt like some comfort food and pizza was it.
Great service by happy friendly staff.
You do pay a bit more here,but you cannot go past the taste and the flavors.
4
High quality decor in this the shopping mall setting. We went there en spec and were not at all disappointed. My pizza was as good as it gets and not that expensive. Next door they have a fine dinning / lunch restaurant which looked great.
5
If you are looking for authentic Italian food, this is the place. Everything great from appetizer over mains to dessert. We like the cosy venue and appreciate the polite staffs. Try it!
4
We came here for dinner and ordered the burrata+roasted tomatoes pizza and the prosciutto margherita pizza. They were really tasty and could have both come across as authentic Italian pizzas. Drinks were also nice but very expensive - not sure they're worth the price. The ice cream was a little bit of a disappointment but that may come down to personal taste.
4
Went here for lunch with my family. Nice place, original and good ambience.Normally you can also have pasta dishes in a place like this but not here, onlypizza. I missed a pizza bolognese on their menu, but besides that, lots of pizzas to choose from. We ordered water and were served Fiji water that was lukewarm. That was a disappointment because we really needed some cold water. Expensive but class
5
Middle of the week, meeting with a couple friend and without any idea what to have for dinner some how "mozzarella" name came on and related to this we remembered "Mozza Pizzeria". What a great idea! A salad for appetizer followed by wonderful pizzas and a dish of the day. And last could not miss a delicious cold beer. The end perfect
5
Now before I start I would like to thank Fenny and Christian, and other staff for the great service and hospitality we were shown while we were seated in the pizzeria. Mozza restaurant is split into two, one is a fine dining experience, and the other is a pizzeria experience, bookings are a must, otherwise you could be waiting, if busy, up to an hour ,which did happen to us, but we didn’t mind as we were in no hurry. When we were seated Fenny came and gave us our menus and took our drinks order. The menu was a great selection of anti-pastas and pizzas. On taking our order, we were both very impressed that the staff, Fenny being one, asked if we had any allergies and as I do, that was fixed in an instant. So to the food, after looking over the menu l decided to have the speck pineapple, mozzarella and tomato, and my husband had the Brussels sprouts pizza with panna,pecorino, and both were so light and tasty that my husband said that he could have ordered other one. The desserts were fantastic. So much choice. The whole night was excellent and thanks to the staff it made the evening another special night while staying in Singapore. Thanks again, you have a fantastic team. 10/10. See you all again on Wednesday
4
Started with their signature nancy chop salad with the bufala, The salad was offered to us by the all smile waitress, FenyFollowed by the great tasting pizza’s and cant get enough with the meat lover pizzaThe wine was a perfect match to it.Finished our meal with desserts.Commending the your waitress Feny for a great serviceGrade: A+ for the food & service, Will recommend this place to my friends who also wants to visit Singapor

Firstly, its an expensive place for a pizza, with a typical item costing almost 1.5 times the average pizza price in Singapore.But then, there's the taste which almost makes up for it. Try which ever item you want they are all explosive in taste and texture. Be-warned they DO NOT make thin crust pizzas. They are all the normal thick pan pizza crust - something that I initially was hesitant to like or savor, but the overall package won me eventually. Is this a place I will go to every time I want a pizza? Definitely no - but if I am in the MBS neighborhood or just want to chic up our casual eats, this is the place I regularly visit.PS : Try the appetizers. They are awesome as well
5
Make reservations before coming , its always packed. Pizzas are good, service was good too. Great place for a family lunch! Gets a little crowded but its buzzing!
5
We come here Every time we travel to Singapore and again this didn't disappoint.
Roasted potatoes, salad, pizza. All delicious and easily the best meal in Singapore
5
Pizzeria Mozza is a buzzing place. Outstanding food with depth in flavour. Think one of the best pizzas I have had.
5
Great margherita pizza, chopped salad and tiramisu. Went for a snack at the Marina Bay Sands shopping center and the food was very good, a little pricey but you 're in a luxury area.
5
We tried this pizzeria and it was amazing. We have tried many pizzerias but this one is top. Not only was the pizza cooked to perfection, the crust is great as well! In addition, had a pleasant night with some great service staff as well!
4
Good pizza but expect to pay for it!
Attentive and good menu with a great selection of wines too nice relaxed atmosphere
4
2 Pizzas and 2 beers £90, tasty and good atmosphere, pizzas good quality and we watched them being made.. its handy for the shops as well!
2
Had dinner there to celebrate family birthday , service is for the first time very disappointing . Have had always patronise the restaurant with Husband in dates and everything works out excellently. But not this occasion and so won't visit again in near future. For service, had to get manager's attention for orders . He walked past our table several times but nope, not taking our orders . Very selective service , only for certain tables I saw. For food, pizzas this round is so chewy that I rather have dominos home delivery . Left straight after dinner with over $200 bill fora lousy dinner
4
its a great place to hang out and chill but very pricey. well its in mbs so it wont be there if it isn't expensive. hahaBf brought me there for my birthday treat. it was his second visit and said they serve good pizza, so we ordered a fungi pizza, hmmm was a little disappointed, as i love mushrooms to max, expecting orgasm from my first bite but nope! no orgasm... LOLwould still come again and am gonna order some other pizza then :) ohh when my pocket is full
4
A busy place in a Saturday night, the menu on the pizzeria side is focused, with a reasonable spread of option for dinner and beverages. The fried squash blossoms were very good, not too heavily breaded, with a nice ricotta filling. The spicy salame pizza was very good. A carafe of red wine went well with dinner. Prices are as expected in an up-scale mall. Total for the above items was S$ 92.
4
Good pizza in nice setting. Cant say i was overly impressed with the food and value. Rating is on the generous side
4
The pizzas are very good. We sat by the bar and watch them making them. It was fun. The spritz cocktail is also good :) A little bit expensive for a pizzeria. And usually pretty crowded.
4
Great Taste! This restaurant was suggested to me a good friend and she said that the pizza there is delicious! So I decided to take a visit there. I loved the place but didn't find the pizza so flavoursome.
4
first love to find a delicioso thin crispy pizza. Better eat in the restaurant. Take away end up the pizza a bit soggy.
2
After few days of Asian food we have decided to eat pizza....Italian pizza said the spot...so I was sure that person cooking pizza was Italian...he wasn't.I have taken pizza called 'salame piccante'....but salame was burned(if you put it at the beginning is normal it burns during cooking...pizza was like a cracker...probably only corn flours has been used? I don't know...price for 2 pizzas 1 bottle of still water and beer was really expensive. What I want to tell is only that I am happy to see my Italian food abroad my country and when well done I am happy to pay but please please if you call something Italian be sure that someone did an Italian cooking course at least....

I came across this restaurant while browsing through Marina Bay Sands. The restaurant is owned by Mario Batali and the entrance allows you to choose the Osteria or Pizzeria. I decided to give the pizzeria a chance. Since I was by myself, I was given a place at the bar which was nice to watch the chefs prepare the pizzas in the oven. I ordered a Mozza Caprese as the antipasti and I have to say it was delicious. The salad features some oven roasted tomatoes, burrata and pesto which made for a tasty combination. I followed this up with a Margherita pizza which was a bit of a hit and miss. It was quite average in terms of flavour compared to some pizzas I have had before. For dessert I had a combination of vanilla gelati and strawberry sorbetti which was definitely the best course of the of the night. It tasted homemade and being a lover of ice cream it gets a thumbs up from me. The waiters were very attentive and helpful. Made sure they were aware of any allergies and food choices before handling the orders. This is a popular restaurant at Marina Bay Sands. Within minutes the seats were all occupied. I'd recommend making a reservation to ensure you have a table
5
I was introduced to this place 5 years ago on my last trip to Singapore and it has not changed. The food is wonderful, and if you sit at the bar, you can watch it being cooked in front of you. I have also never had a more wonderful mojito than here. I highly recommend the raspberry mojito if you try it. It can get very crowded here, but I think that is because it is such a wonderful place to eat.This place is a bit pricey, but if you love good, I cannot rave about this place enough. It is a mist try if you are in the area
3
a very disappointing experience - the pizzas were average at best  will not be repeating the experienc
3
The atmosphere and ambience is nice here. The pizza toppings and variety is a little limited but the food was good. The only let down with this place was the service being a little slow. We waited far too long for our bill to be sorted
4
Amazing pizza! The place have a nice ambience and a good selection of pizza to try. Apparently this is one of the best pizzaeria in town and by the same chef as Osteria Mozza next door, which I love. Book in advance though, it gets packed.
5
Candice was our Wait-Person and was a pleasure to work with. She had a ready smile, knowledge of the menu, and was attentive to our needs.
The food was AWESOME!!
Bruschetta and Pizza!!
Beware - Wine is expensive in Singapore - By Aussie standards.
3
I liked a lot the environment, reminding me a typical Italian pizzeria with wood oven as well. It might be because of this that I had big expectations...the pizza was just average, nothing special to be fair, plus there was no tomato sauce and this should be reminded while ordering as you give it for granted even if not mentioned in the menu. I still would try it again to see if I was just unlucky with the choice
3
Staying at marina bay sands, we were eager to try some of the restaurants. As pizza lovers this place was first on the list. Unfortunately whilst the ingredients were fresh and the base cooked very nicely, somehow the pizzas didn't taste quite right. This would have been ok if it weren't for the extortionate price. Â£55 For dinner for 2 with no starters at a pizza restaurant is way too much
4
This restaurant is a nice place to be at. However, the service was not there. When we were at the entrance and waiting for a table (there was no other guests waiting except us), the waiters were just talking at the bar area and did not care about us.
3
Kind of had to eat here because all of the restaurants had longer waits than we expected. Teenage boys are pizza connoisseurs but they weren't too enthralled with this pizza. The atmosphere was fun and upbeat and our waiter was very nice and accommodating but it was probably not a place we would eat again. Not bad, just not what we expected
3
I was really looking forward to Pizzeria Mozza and trying out Nancy's Chopped Salad for lunch. Unfortunately it was a let down from my expectations even though the meat and cheese in the salad were of exceptional quality. The dressing though did not deliver enough punch. Overall just an average experience
3
I had been dying to try this place since I first visited Singapore back in 2013.It is beautiful and interesting and I love pizza. Madly. After working up an appetite at the shoppes I convinced my "not a fan of pizza" husband to give it a try because it's "really famous" and has a famous chef. The prices are outrageous, the seat perched high next to the window was uncomfortable, and the portion size would make Old Mother Hubbard blush. The pizza was interesting (or perhaps I was just hungry for more, because there was so little of it) Is this an example of arrogance at its worst or did I miss the point? Sadly, to me overrated and overpriced with little utility
1
Terrible pizzas. Overly Salty and oily bruschetta. Terrible food. Pizzas are mostly uncooked, doughy, oily, tasteless and full of flour on the base. You can just taste flour and oil. Only good thing here - sparkling water and beer. (Packaged)  Oh and everything is Super expensive. Also not no mention upset stomach I got almost right away after eating here.Do your self a favor and don't come here and waste money and time.
2
I have come to this restaurant on various occasions over the past 4yrs - after the first time, mostly I came because of the occasion than the Exprience. Unfortunately quality of food and service (food mainly) has slipped year after year. Pizza quality is low. They try to make the menu seem fancy, but the kitchen can't get basics of an Italian pizza right; tasty base, balance sauce, good cheese and simple fresh toppings. I was told by the manager after complaining that "our pizza is not a topical Italian", " we deliberately have semi crispy crust and a wet chewy base in the middle". The sauce is tart, sort that gives heartburn, too many confused toppings on most pizzas on the menu.Wine list is not much to write about either. A lot of commercial variety that are less than 5yrs old for unrealistic prices.The staff are pushy with the alcohol but their knowledge of the food, wine and general recommendation just not there
2
I saw Nancy Silverton on TV so I was dying to try this place. I paid $67 for 1 pizza and 1 beer, quite expensive in my mind. Actually, dam expensive!The pizza was okay, nothing impressive. With the exception of the meat balls I was struggling to find anything else that resembled meat on a "meat lovers" pizza. At about $44 it was the most expensive pizza in my life and I think a $10 Dominos meat lovers pizza in Australia would have more toppings and been just as tasty.The service was great, the atmosphere was great.Maybe I just chose the wrong thing but I did ask for the "best they have" and this was their most popular pizza
5
Went there with a couple of friends. The food and service at this place were great and it had a very relaxed atmosphere to it. This was my second visit there and it was very good. Will definitely visit again.
5
Had the best pizza, and the best soft drink choices. staff were very friendly and helpful. the place to be
5
Best Food I ate in my whole trip with of Singapore . very nice service. Worth at least one Visit if you are in Singapore
4
My family & I went to the restaurant for the first time last night. The food was great - freshly cooked, very tasty and well presented. I had the Prosciutto di Parma pizza and it was the best pizza I have ever tasted. The waiters were attentive and helpful, especially the Italian manager who provided exceptional service. Overall a good meal and very positive experience, so we will certainly be going back
3
Yuppy and busy. Simple but extensive menu and service is good enough. For us though, the vibe was a little hurried and pretentious. Location is strategic and I suppose if you happen to be in the vicinity, you really don't have that many options, perhaps that's why this place is usually packed! W
5
This is my third time to the restaurant and it has not fail me in service level and quality of the food we had. This time round my wife and me decided to try something different so we ordered Meatball Al Forno, Burrata Pizza, Lasagne Al Forno and dessert was Caramel copetta. My favorite is the meatball and caramel copetta. If you plan to eat at this restaurant, it is best to make reservation or else you may have to queue or have bar counter seats
5
I had a lunch here while at the Expo for a trade show. The place was packed so I sat at the bar and was able to watch them make pizzas. I decided on a panini sandwich a few different kinds of meat and it was done to perfection. It came with a large, delicious salad. The service was quick and attentive. Next time I am going to try the pizza which looked great.
2
Such a busy restaurant, however we managed to get a couple of seats at the counter overlooking all the pizza preparation. It was incredibly exciting to watch until suddenly the guy who finalized the order for wait staff threw a temper tantrum that went on for ages. It was embarrassing to watch and the reason I would not recommend this eatery.Also, for one pizza and two glasses of red wine I paid just over SG$ 95. The pizza was OK and the wines were in the cheaper category.Goodness me – our most expensive eating experience in Singapore – for a PIZZA!!Give it a go if you wish – we certainly won’t be back
3
Since I'm living in Singapore (6 months now) I've been dreaming about my loved European food. Finally we went to this restaurant for my birthday, and unfortunately I was disappointed. Service was great, 5 stars, and food was ok to pretty good, but it's just not what I expected and is not the taste of Pizza I'm used to eat. I'm Spanish and not Italian, and maybe I have a cheap taste? Anyway I was expecting something amazing and I got the feeling of being just a good pizza. I couldn't even eat my pizza with fork and knife, I had to eat it with my hands because it was impossible to cut (don't get me wrong, I'm all for eating American pizza with my hands, but not Italian pizza on a restaurant such as this one). All in all, I'm not completely happy with my experience here but I think it might be more about my expectations than about the food. As I said, service was great although the restaurant was a bit too noisy.
1
My wife and I wanted a quick lunch so we stopped at Pizzeria Mozza. It was about 2pm and we were very hungry. We have eaten there before the theater at MBS and knew what to expect. My wife ordered the spinach, ricotta salata, pine nut, lemon insalate. The first salad was soaked in so much lemon her jaw locked. Mine too after one bite! She sent it back. They gave her a new insalate, dressing on the side.......this time, the spinach salad tasted like salt! Not sure if they use salt water to wash spinach or went crazy with the salt shaker.... I had the mozza caprese which was fresh but does not make up for how bad our experience was. I suggest stick to the pizza was good last time we had it
5
We stopped in for a late lunch of pizza, meatballs and some cauliflower bites. Delicious, casual, quick and perfect service, what more could you want.
Loved it!
5
We decided to share a Burrata pizza. Very nice menu. Pizza pastas the usual Italian. Wood fired very crisp and totally delicious. Really lovely and do recommend
5
We enjoyed a lovely family dinner.Service was friendly and efficient on a busy evening.Prices are really reasonable.Will definitely return soon.

the quality which we where excpeting of this celebrity Restaurant was not that Great ..
food & service was good ..
but nothing very sepcial
1
Stopped by for a quick salad at lunch. Ordered the one with spinach, pine nuts, pomegranate seed and anchovy ($18). When I took my first bite, I had to spit it out! It was like eating raw lemon! Clearly they put too much lemon on it. The waitress took it back, promising to fix it. The replacement salad was even worse! The spinach leaves were as if someone had soaked them in salt. Super-short for time, I had little choice but to eat it. When we complained about the bad food, all we got was a smile from the waitress.... are they used to this? The hostess didn't seem to care either.My takeaway... this place thinks it has a captive audience, given its location across from the big theatre in MBS. I say, "Don't rest on your laurels." My husband and I will never return, and if this restaurant continues to serve meals like this one, no one else will be returning either.
3
I've eaten at Pizzeria Mozza several times before and always enjoyed it, but last was a bit of a let down. I had to send back one of our pizzas, as half of it had no cheese on it, just dry toppings. The server was great and fixed the problem with no hesitation so it certainly wasn't her fault, but I don't think it's particularly hard to put cheese on a pizza, especially when you're charging over $30 for it! The Insalata Mista was also the most disappointing salad I have ever had at an Italian restaurant. It was basically just a pile of the cheapest stringiest salad leaves (the sort you can get a bag of for about $1) with a bit of olive oil dressing. There wasn't any other ingredient, so certainly not what I would call a mixed salad. Frankly, for a restaurant of this calibre, and given the quality of the other food they serve, I was very disappointed by this.So overall a let-down for me last night. I won't be hurrying back given the quality of other Italian meals I've had in Singapore recently
4
You can find variety of pizza that suit your taste here! You may ask the waiter for your recommendation if you are open for anything, they are very helpful and might surprise you with adventurous try of pizza. Usually packed during rush hour, suggest to go slightly earlier or slightly later than the usual dinner hour. We ordered two beers, IPA to match with the pizza and special of the day, lasagna. All matches perfectly!
2
This is not the first visit to Pizzeria, but will likely be our last.My husband and I were rushing to watch a musical show opposite, and had to order takeaway in hopes of being able to make the entrance time. The food was ready earlier than expected, and we had about 10-15 minutes to the show beginning, so we decided to start to eat some of the takeaway food at the bar. Food was, as always, delicious. However, the judgmental looks of visible disgust from the waitstaff - a Filipino middle aged waitress and an Indian man - were enough to make me lose my appetite. We were then accosted rather impolitely by another Filipino hostess who questioned exactly what we were doing (quite obvious, I thought?). As a paying customer, we had every right to be seated there, but I guess the waitstaff thought otherwise. The restaurant wasn't even full as it was a weeknight, so I really don't see what the issue was! Guess we won't be going back
5
Had the fennel sausage pizza and the eggplant and humus starter. Surprisingly good eggplant in generous portion. The pizza was excellent where the marinara sauce wasn't too piquant and wasn't dry in the pizza. The pizza base itself was crunchy and yet chewy on the ends. Great flavor. Will definitely go again. A bit pricey though. A bit off that you can either go to the pizza or pasta section and you can't order from the other side

The pizza is superb Also the piatti del giorno was excellent !Being from Europe we are very used to pizza and melanzane al forno , but these ones had a very special taste .Also the drinks are in line with the food Just to adapt the price a little bit to Europe because it is quite hig
5
Singapore is short of good pizza. Most are either incredibly poorly made or spot obsene prices... Mozza is different. Pizza done right at reasonable prices. Re space is nice and fun too. The American tunes are also a treat!
4
Have never been disappointed here. On my last visit, I tried the Burrata pizza (burrata, slow roasted tomatoes & Sicilian oregano) which had just the right hint of both sweetness (from the tomatoes) and spice. Service is quick and pleasant.
5
Recommended by my friend, we were looking for this pizza place.Location is very good.Size of pizza was huge,and pizza was delicious. Service was amazing. Will definitely come again.
4
Good, hearty, Italian food that won't break the bank. What more do you need? Oh, yeah: a family friendly environment and service that is prompt, knowledgeable and considerate.
5
If you cant get into Osteria then u hop over and sit in a more casual setting at Pizzeria. The menu is different but that's not a criticism. Pizza's are excellent
4
Housed in the Marina Bay Sands complex , this restaurant is very nice , lively , good atmosphere and amazing pizza . An excellent wine selection and quite good prices .. recommended
5
Very expensive, way too cold - but the Pizza, meat balls and many other things are outstanding. REALLY good, tasty and nicely seasoned. We come back every year. We would go more often during our stays - if the temperature would be normal.
5
Super casual, amazing service, always busy and fantastic food. What else does one want? The pizzas are excellent, the salads are great and I love the dessert selection. Highly recommend the rosemary potatoes and berry dessert (cannot recall the exact name). If you want any help, as the manager. I have always ordered according to her suggestions and have never gone wrong. Hearty and satisfying pizzas. A must try
5
On our first visit here, we were unsure what to expect despite reading the reviews. Suffice to say, we were blown away by both the service and the food. But, I would say that that service stands out. From quick response to taking our orders, to suggestions of dishes based on our dietary restrictions and also checking to make sure that our meal was fine - my husband and I were highly impressed with the service level. Our waitstaff, Riza (I forgot to get the spelling of her name) was exceptionally good at her job and making our evening a special one. Regarding food, we had a prawn and potato starter - I cannot recall when I last had such juicy prawns which were yum! The mushroom pizza was the right size for 2 people and had a variety of mushrooms which made every bite a taste explosion. Dessert was fab as well. The gelati is really good although 3 scoops is a bit much. However, in my world, there's always room for dessert =) My husband had the rocky road pie which was chocolate heaven. In short, we enjoyed our visit. Perhaps, the one thing to take note of would be the fact that the restaurant is quite noisy with music and large crowds and not the most suitable place for a cosy evening. No complaints otherwise
5
This is our third visits to this place. But this place is getting better and better. This time we just order one Pizza and more appetizers. The Chicken liver on bread is to die for. The Caprese salad is just amazing!! Pizza is always good. Our server recommends us the mussels.... which instantly becomes our favorite!! Basically this place never disappointed us. Awesome food, good service, and amazing ambiance!!
5
Amazing food - great service by Cristian and all the staff - very busy restaurant and you can see why
2
Very disappointing! The service was very good but the food was very disappointing. The calamari was very over priced. $18 for two small pieces of calamari. The pizza was served luke warm and had very little cheese. I do not recommend this restaurant.
5
I had a great time with my friends in this restaurant. The Pizzas and other food were so delicious, the drinks and desserts were fantastic. I definitely come back to this place again.
5
The pizzas are delicious - the crust is different and tasty. The salads too are very good. This place is very busy so a reservation is recommended.
3
Coming here often and still haven't found it inside me to blown away by their supposedly amazing pizza. Attract lots of crowd with very cheap lunch menu.
5
Located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands plaza, "Mozza" is the NYC-styled pizzeria by chef Mario Batali.Incredibly cooked, stone pizzas, wonderful beer + wine list, efficient and friendly service (by Singapore standards) all add up to make it worth the cost.A perfect spot for a Sunday afternoon pie or pre-show drink, hit up Mozza for Singapore's best
3
Great attentive service. Mozza is divided at the entrance with the right side a sit-down classy pizzeria and the left side the Osteria mozza.Good selection of wines and same for pizzas. Mine was Brussells sprouts ( a first on a pizza) with bacon and onion. Very tasty although a bit light on the cheese. Sauces are delicious . I thought they were pricey (each pizza around $30 S $ (about $23 US) but tasty and surprisingly light ( very thin crust
4
My last trip to Pizza Mozza was pretty poor. Bad service, average food and dishes not available. I am pleased to say that I visited gain with some friends and this time they were on their game. Service was very good an unobtrusive, food also very good with the Umbrian lentils and goats cheese and beets and mozzarella delicious starters. We then had the mushroom pizza and fennel sausage and bacon pizza, both of which were piping hot and also delicious.We had a couple of glasses each of the wine of the month and it was scrumptious.Great recovery after such a poor experience last time
5
Came for a dinner with my husband after a long day shopping and it was delicious!!! The wood fire pizzas are so authentic and tasty!! We also ordered the prawn antipasto dish with potatoes and the wild mushroom bruschetta and the fresh citrus salad - all were amazing!! The flavours are perfect with dish being deliciously good! No salt or pepper needed!! The mango ice tea was very refreshing also. Fantastic service, Definitely recommend you eat here. Enjoy!
5
Every time we have been here we love it - is always packed but you can sit at the bar or wait for a table.The potatoes from the wood oven, the beetroot and horseradish salad, and of course the fantastic pizza.Went twice in a week just recently.Would be back again now if I could
5
The pizza was really good! It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Other dishes we got - salads, appetizers were also very satisfying. I will definitely go back to this restaurant if I visit Singapore again.
5
Nothing much to say except excellent service , best mussel i have even eaten and pretty damn good pizza. Will come back for more!!
5
Pizza was great.
Service was exceptional, really attentive and friendly.
Great atmosphere, pretty busy all the time, people chatting, good tunes.
Everything you'd want in a Pizzeria.
5
excellent quality and excellent food, menu is limited but the food is really great, just like italy, please give it a try

I just got off an 8 hour flight from Dubai and came straight to Mozza as I read the pizza was great...and it is. I had the salami with chilli and it was excellent. It was probably one of the best I've tasted. Nice crispy crust and lots of ingredients. Kudos to the chef! However, what let's this place down is the clumsy, but well meaning staff. As soon as I was seated I was given a menu and asked what I would like to drink. I ordered a refreshing Italian ale it it was served immediately (excellent service so far). Then, within a minute of being served the beer, I was asked what I would like eat. I explained to the waitress that I would like to chill for 10-15 minutes and would then order. Within another minute, I had two other staff members ask me what I would like to eat. I had to tell the last person (with a bit of an attitude...sorry) that I would let him or one of his colleagues know when I would like to order. Nevertheless, he was back in 5 minutes and asked what I wanted to order. I gave up at this point and ordered a salad and a pizza. The pizza turns up within 10 minutes, but no salad. (It wasn't a complex order...2 items). Anyway, this wasn't a major issue as the pizza turned out to be super filling and delicious. Anyway, I then ask for pepper and chilles. The lovely young lady that I asked said no problem, but as you can guess, my request never turn up. I had to then ask another staff member. I didn't mention the salad to the person that took my order as I genuinely think he forgot. The staff seem to want to please, but I think there is a lack of coordination. The restaurant was half-full so there was no excuse for sloppiness. The restaurant had a customer (me) that wanted to chill, have a few ( a lot) drinks and then order. Don't rush people as if it's a fast food joint as you then end up making mistakes. So, go for the food, friendly staff, but just make sure you remind them what you have ordered and not to rush you. I paid just over US$90 for a pizza, 2 beers, a bottle of water and a glass of red wine. Surely they could have given me 15 mins of peace!
5
Had a long week at work decided to grab something really nice dinner.Reservations was quick and they are pretty responsive. I was first refer to the bar seats but i said possible for table and they look it up gave me a table soonAs usual it busy on a Friday night bit noisy but the ambiance is pretty okGood selection of food but i always have my favorite the Chicken al diavlo and the so delicous Goat Cheese pizza with Bacon. Then i finished of with Butterscotch Budino for dessertAgain never fails me to satisfy my taste buds. Food coma last night
5
We ordered calamari and mussels as antipasti and pizza napoletana for the main plus wine and everything was terrific. Restaurant staff from reception to food service were all very polite, attentive, and accommodating. We didn't have reservations, but was accommodated at the bar area. It's nice and spacious and you get a view of the pizza making and baking. Will definitely go back! I hope we have this kind of restaurant back home.
4
Stopped in for a break from shopping and while we were waiting for the light show at GBTB. Shared a pizza and had a drink each and not much change out of $100. Very expensive for what it is and staff very pushy with the add ons. Pizza was nice though and you are in MBS so expect to pay through the nose.
5
Really, really good pizzas and wine. There was something special about the dough itself that made me want to eat more despite eating a whole one for myself. On top of that,the service was superb! I was actually taken aback at first because the first guy who served us started barging about their wine promotion even though we haven't even sat down for one full minute. I felt so suffocated and wanted to leave. Luckily I didn't as I realized that everything else was actually splendid. Thanks for the great meal and fantastic service
5
I love food. I love Malay food. I love Thai food. I love Chinese food. I love Indian food. That said, after two weeks in Asia (Singapore & Thailand) I needed pizza. We enjoyed the Mozza caprese, chicken liver bruschetta and the brussel sprout pizza. Everything including the service was great. We found service to be a little subpar in Singapore but not here.
5
Best Crust, Best Cheese, Best Toppings, in the best place (Marina bay sands) of SG
You'll find Authentic Goat Cheese wooden oven Pizza here. Frankly speaking, the best I ever had.
5
What a fabulous restaurant. We were at the restaurant, not the pizza section.
Our three course meal was amazing! Each dish was perfection. Balanced delicate flavors. Try the celery root pasta!!!! Insane good
Yum, yum, yum.
I can't recommend enough.
5
What else can one say: delicious pizzas with a crispy thin crust and great-tasting ingredients, efficient and thoughtful service, and convenient location.
3
The bad part is the front desk. Four to five ladies welcome you to the pizzeria or restaurant and that's where it starts and ends. Upon arrival, we were greeted only after we started talking ourselves although there was not one other customer waiting, they were all just talking amongst themselves. We had pizza and some tapas, as always when we go there, and the pizzas were still very good, among the best in Singapore I'd say, but still I couldn't help but feeling that something was different from before. Maybe the crust was a lot thicker than otherwise, or a bit tougher to bit, I'm not sure, but still they were different although still very good nonetheless. So I'd go there again, that's for sure. However, upon leaving, we, including our guests we had brought this time, all happily said goodbye to the front desk ladies when leaving and not one single lady looked up to say goodbye to us. That is simply unacceptable for a place like this. We were ashamed for our guests as we took them to this place we talked so much about and now they didn't even get a friendly smile when leaving, that kind of neutralizes the whole dining experience. Anyway, good food and ambience but they may want to train their front desk ladies a bit more.
4
We stopped here for a quick pizza and beer. The pizza was freshly made and great. Service was good. It does feel a bit like a cafeteria as the tables are closely packed with staff weaving in and out carrying pizzas, lasagnas etc. Would recommend it you want a quick snack but not for a special mea
4
i kept coming back here for pizza; be it on a lazy weekend or before the theatre. Each time, I tried different Pizza. After a few times, I have my favourite list of food here. Would recommend the Cauliflower Fritti and avoid the roated eggplantAs for the pizza, i like the prosciutto di parma (simple). However, last weekend, I want to avoid so much meat and therefore, decided to try the pizza el benno. Like it as it is because not too many pineapples. Tried the Burrata before, however not my favourite though I love burrate cheese. Somehow, the combination in the pizza doesn't turn out to my likingAs always, i will finish it with caramel copetta as desert (provided there's space in the stomach). I like to bite on the peanuts. It would be better if the peanut is being substituted by other nuts like hazelnu

@TheKuoKnowsI think my search for the best pizza parlour in Singapore is almost over. Thank goodnes - I don't think my waistline can take much more.Pizzaria Mozza, which is housed in upmarket Marina Bay Sands, gives a masterclass in pizza making. You can even watch the chefs prepare the flatbreads from the comfort of your table, if you look over to the serving counter.Each pizza is delicately thin and beautifully crispy. There are even a few burnt bits that add to the eating pleasure.I thought the Napoletana was out of this world. Just the right amount of anchovies, capers and black olives. I did ask for more mushroom though, because I am a fun guy!Pizzaria Mozza doesn't serve pasta. So if you are after a bowl of spaghetti, as I did, then it could be a little disappointing.It doesn't have Tiramisu, either. That's another blot on Pizzaria Mozza report card.But as far as pizzas are concerned, it is top drawer. It is so good that booking is highly recommended.
5
I walked past it several times on the way back to hotel, and then decided to take the plunge. Nothing better when starving than a pizza with real mozzarella and real Italian meats.I was pleasantly surprised of the authenticity of the pizza. Tasted just like the real thing and took me back to my travels in Italy. Yes relatively expensive compared to Italy, but this is Singapore and the location rental would not be cheap
4
Located within the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex, this Italian eatery is busy and active. A friendly greeting was a good start. We were lucky to grab the last table (for 5... 2 adults & 3 children).We decided on Antipasti to start. Meatballs, Fried Potatoes, Roasted Beets salad with buffalo cheese and Calamari. All were very tasty and recommended.We chose the Margarita pizza and Fennel Sausage with red onion pizza. Both were very good.Price wise for the drinks (two wines and 3 soft drinks) and food, plus taxes, it was Pricy but the food quality was very good. Friendly and prompt service was appreciated. So if you are shopping or just sightseeing in Marina Bay Sands area, head here to satisfy the taste buds (and a sit down after all that shopping).
5
We was looking for something to eat at Marina Bay Sands and saw Pizzeria Mozza. Originally we wanted to try the Pasta but the antipasti and pizza looks interesting. The setup of the restaurant looks and feels similar to the ones we visited in Rome and Florence albeit a noisier version but still allow us to converse. Following the advice of the waitress, we tried Squash Bloom with Ricotta and Parma Ham with Rocket and Ricotta pizza. It is amazing! While the blossoms looked more like tempura, when the knife cuts thru it, the difference is immediately obvious. The flavourful ricotta flows out of the blossom complementing the earthly taste of the blossom. It is a must try. Next is the pizza. We really like the base. The base is chewy yet crispy on the edge. The pizza looks simple the ingredient is simple yet the final product is delightfully tasty. And the staff in the restaurant is always around to serve with a smile. A must go in MB
4
Food is average but service is over the top. If you're at Marina Bay Sands give it a try. Pizza is typical for mozza locations but allot better than the one in LA That's for sure
5
We had no reservation and were able to get a table. The service was efficient and friendly and the pizzas excellent. A more casual option compared to the sister restaurant, but equally as good.
4
The food here is delicious and is easily accessible within the Marina Bay Sands. The price is a bit high but the great taste makes up for it.
5
Pizzeria Mozzi offers mainly pizza & starters, no pasta. However, the pizza with spicy salami was the best I have tried and I have been to Italy many times! Very good salad and gelato! The prices are higher but it's worthy!
2
A busy restaurant so obviously doing something right! However, a starter, a pizza, lettuce leaves for 2 people and a bottle of cheap Italian wine was 220 dollars! Food was fine but not exceptional.
Could not recommend this place.
5
Always enjoy Mozza's pizza and antipasti selection. It is definitely not your every day pizza and comes with price tag.
5
We stopped by for a quick lunch, the restaurant was very busy but the food was excellent. The food is very fresh and original!
3
Been there with friends for dinner..not many options available if you are chicken lover..only 1 dish available that too chicken wings..disappointed to see such option at celebratory chef restaurant at fabulous location MBS..
Service & Ambience was up to US standards..Food quality was ok..
2
The pizza was good. It wasn't great it was good. You can get this quality of pizza anywhere and it shouldn't cost over $40 for a personal pizza. Pizza is mostly made of flour and water. You didn't use gold for the cheese. $8.50 for a lemonade, wow didn't realize lemons and sugar were so scarce in Singapore. Service was good.
4
Pizzeria Mozza is definitely one the top pizza restaurants in Singapore... food, service and atmosphere is definitely top shelf. If you're a pizza lover you owe it to yourself to at least try it.I've been several times over the last few years, and by and large it's a great experience. The pizza variety is good, with great flavors and crust. The sides and desserts are also exceptional.Service and experience is pretty much flawless..My only trailing comment to this review, and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars... is that on my most recent visit the pizza wasn't quite there. It was still a great to eat.... but somehow the sausage and fennel pizza wasn't quite as flavorsome and maybe a little dry from the fennel.That said, 5 out of my 6 visits have been great... maybe it was just an off night.Still highly recommended
5
Had lunch at Mozza today, what a yummy pizza. We sat up at the bar and watched all the pizzas being prepared and cooked while waiting for ours. Excellent crust and good quality ingredients. Not to be missed by any pizza lover.
2
We have try this restaurant !!twice !!The quality of pizza and other food was tremendous down !!Having variety of pizza and other food !!I would say just waste of money !!Only big names is here !!Can get better with other good brand restaurants !!Service was good !!But the quality of food was really very down! We do not think will be back again !
3
Walked past and saw there was tables finally vacant. The waitress recommended for us to get the calamari as a starer. ONE SKEWER of small calamari came out. My partner and I looked at each other and we're just like ok... this ONE skewer was $16 what a silly recommendation. We ordered one pizza ($37) and it was okay not amazing. Our bill ended up being $90 for one entree,1 beer, 1 pizza and 1 soda. Not worth it. My partner and I eat at plenty of fine dining and high end places but this was not worth it and we were still hungry
5
This is a must visit for anyone who loves pizza! The food was absolutely exquisite and the staff were friendly professional and efficient the whole time we were here. Considering this is a celebrity chef restaurant in an iconic Singapore hotel, the price is definitely reasonable. Cannot recommend enough!
5
This is a must stop for pizza lovers. The fennel sausage pizza is the stuff of legends and this Batali masterpiece will take you to new heights. Complement the meal with a salad or one of their starters (prawns al forno is excellent), enjoy with a glass or two of wine and you are set for the evening! You will not be disappointed
5
It is important to note this place is very expensive. Providing you are prepared to pay these kind of prices then you will enjoy your meal and time here. The service is excellent. We are a young couple, were not dressed smart at the time and we were still treated like royalty. They did not have any tables available at the time but still made room for us at the bar. When I say 'the bar' we were sat up front watching them make the pizzas in the stone ovens right in front of us. They have a very good variety of pizzas and sides. The pizzas were absolutely delicious too. Would really recommend this place a visit.
3
You're eating in a mall basically and it cost $250 for 2 basic salads, 4 pizzas, 2 with additional toppings, 1 dessert and 2 coffees, oh and a bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water which cost $12!No alcohol, which would have sent the bill over $300.Yes we got hoodwinked on the old 'would you like some water regular or sparkling?' - regular tap water served in a bottle is free!!Staff were attentive apart from when I asked for a second bottle of water and it happened to be regular water...it didn't come so had to ask for it again.Pizzas are excellent and you can watch them being prepared behind a high counter as a chef makes the dough bases. They're thin and crispy and use excellent ingredients. All about $25 to $40The dessert was a gelato 3 scoops for just under $20. Enough for two people to share after a pizza. It was okThe place is busy usually and I guess rents are high but you're paying a big premium. Nevertheless one of the best pizzas in Singapore
5
Everything was done right, service to plating to taste. They warm you up with seasoned wedges and for apps and mains well...here you go..Meatballs came with pressed garlic bread and a marinara sauce that was just lightly sweet enough, the meatballs themselves were like butter.Spinach Salad was lightly dressed and covered with shredded chees and topped with anchovies. Perfect blend of flavors.Potato Pizza was just plain comfort done right, a semi raw egg in the center that is popped and spread on service, potato and bacon with a coating of Mozz cheese.Olive Oil Ice Cream...uh...you gotta try it! Insane!Great place in Singapore in a great location to walk it off after... must try
5
Pizza is excellent. We had the three cheeses pizza (we love the sage) as well as the spinach pizza. For appetiser, we had Italian meatball.... which was very tasty and fresh tomato sauce. Pizza is about $30++. Good selection of wine too. Note, this place is crowded.
4
What could be so special about a pizza? You want the answer? Eat at this place to know the difference. Ordered a spinach and pine nut salad, chicken wings (Upsized the order) and grilled squids as starters. See the pictures and they should add up to a 1000 words each in praising it. Ordered a parma ham pizza - fab, so ordered one more. Bill for 4 with drinks SD 200 inclusive of tax and service. Will I eat here again. I could do that right now
5
Wonderful fire oven pizza. One of the best I ever had. The dough and crest was too Good. Will love to visit again. This place is Run by a USA chef.
3
Pizzas here are ok, they taste nice but I wouldn't pay $30 for their pizza again. Probably have to try other things on the menu next time
5
We ate at this restaurant several years ago when visiting Singapore and were keen to revisit. It was late, we had no booking however were offered seats at the bar - which ultimately turned out to be the best seats in the house. The wait staff were excellent, the food excellent, the noise level was fine and the seats at the bar offered the opportunity to chat with the chef whilst observing his skills in preparing and delivering food to the pass
5
We had dinner here on a weekday and the place was full, as always. We have dined here many times in the past and were not disappointed.Service is prompt & the pizzas are consistently good - springy, crisp, airy crust with fresh, generous toppings and fanciful variations. We always order one pizza per diner, plus appetizers, wine & espresso.Atmosphere is buzzing, hence the restaurant can be noisy at times. Lighting is so dim that you can't take a good picture nor have a clear look at what you are eating which is a shame.We'll be back for the pizzas & calamari
3
I don't mind paying the price for a nice meal but this restaurant probably isn't worth the price tag. Our meal was $100 for 1x pizza, small bruschetta and 2 x pieces of calamari (we drank water). Food was tasty, service was ok and the atmosphere is reasonable.
4
We had lunch here on a public holiday and the place was full. We have enjoyed dining here a few times in the past and we were not disappointed. We like the bacon, salame, fennel sausage pizza and the grilled burrata. The chicken wings were very tasty but very oil. In fact, our pizza was rather oily too evidenced by the oil residue on the pizza platter. I would rate this place as Excellent if not for how oily our food was and that it was also very noisy in the restaurant. It may be due to how sound is amplified or maybe it's intended to create a lively atmosphere
5
U need to make a reservation. I came about this place online and it read that this was as close to Italy you could find in Asia. I was sceptical initially. Our waiter's name was Princess, she was attentive, informative and always nearby which made our dinner that more enjoyable. Indeed, the food was authentic and a delight. Its as close to Italy, one could find. We had the calamari and chicken wings as appetizers which were excellent. The chicken liver Bruschetta which was to die for. Three pizzas - Margherita, al Benno ( love the jalapeno), and Funghi Misti (you cannot go wrong with this). Just to add to the dinner, we also ordered a serve of Prosciutto di Parma.Overall, despite it being a busy Saturday evening, service was excellent and the food amazing.I would not hesitate to recommend this place
4
Came here for dinner and they have a choice of either casual or fine dining. The service is superb and the pizzas are nice though pricey. The pizza with egg n potato was unique n delicious and cost S$38++. There 's 3 of us so they cut the pizzas into 6 slices. The chicken wings cost S$18/- before service charge and GST and there's only 3 pieces of chicken wings which means it's S$7/- per piece... while it's nice, it's not unique so it's not worth the price.
1
The two starters we requested, the zucchini flower with ricotta and gravlax were."not available yet" whatever that means so we opted for the Tuscan white bean bruschetta. When this dish arrived, it was a white bean purée that resembled baby food and the topping had no texture. If you are going to serve beans as a puree verging on the liquid, please say so on the menu. We had a mixed salad which was very small and consisted of just a few salad leaves. Nothing in there to add a bit of texture or crunch or even a tomato or two!!!!We shared a Napolitani pizza and yes it comes with olives, anchovies and capers so I expected it to be salty but this was Super salty to the extent that it was unpleasant. Meal was accompanied by a nice glass of Prosecco and a very nice red of the month. Service was also very pleasant and helpful but wasn't enough to rescue the food in the rating.Shame as I have been here before and the food had been much better or maybe I was just lucky with what I had chosen previously
5
We were strolling through Marina Sands complex when we noticed Pizzeria Mozza restaurant. Basically we were hanging out for a good cappuccino which they delivered perfectly. The restaurant has a fabulous ambience b as it was buzzing with people which is always a good sign. We enjoyed our coffee at the bar as there was no tables left. The food been delivered to the tables looked very impressive & I'm looking forward to dining here next time we are in Singapore .
5
Food was like being in Italy - very impressed with it all. Pizza was sensational
- extremely tasty and fresh. Will recommend all Australian friends to try here.
4
The Pizzas were great but highly overprices $20 for a beer !!!!
The staff was great and good service
4
We went here for dinner and ended up ordering one pizza each. That was a lot of food in hindsight we should have shared one! Good drinks, good food but a bit to expensive to get "top score".
5
It's not everyday that you can find that quality of pizza in cities around the world. I didn't expect much, but the pizza was delicious !
5
This is definitely one if the best pizza in Singapore. The dough is amazingly thin and crusty. The favorite pizza for my kids. The funghi pizza is really exceptional.I often like to sit at the counter bar. Last, the crackers offered at the beginning is an incentive to start with a beer or a glass of wine
4
This wasn't my first choice, but my daughter had her pick! We have dined at Mozza in So. Cal and have enjoyed each meal. This dinner lived up to our expectation with food being delicious. The pizza albeit a small portion of crust quite well done (burnt) was excellent with the burrata and small tomatoes. The fried cauliflower was amazing. But the best was the Butterscotch Budino! This was as good if not better. The staff was friendly but very busy, so they forgot my coffee. In all an enjoyable dinner, but still I believe there is "no place like home"! (The Newport Beach Mozza
3
Mozza is a pretty nice place to hang out and seeing the 2 domed ovens looks really promising. Alas, the pizza was mediocre (flat bread was good, though) the crust wasn't chewy and the sauce tasted like canned tomato paste.Go if you're already at MBS but don't bother otherwise
5
Went here before going to watch a show, next time I will make sure to call and book, told them we had a time to leave and they were very happy to help. Order to share, then you can get to try many nice little bites.
5
We usually go to osteria. Glad I gave this a go. We ordered exclusively from the appys menu. The funghi insalata was well dressed n well seasoned. The goats cheese with lentils surprisingly heartwarming. The meatballs were a hit with sprinkles of Parmesan thru the sauce. Put the fried pigs ears on your shortlist...creamy deep fried goodness..what can I say more of?Do try the buratta tomato pizza..its the house special for a reason. Definitely save space for the pumpkin gelato pie. Candied pecans on top of smooth cream over smooth pumpkin gelato laced with proper rum sauce..that and an authentic negroni is a great way to end a good meal
4
I love Osteria Mozza but as they don't open for lunch during the weekdays, I went to Pizzeria Mozza. Personally I think it wasn't as great as Osteria Mozza, but it was still good Italian. Maybe my selection of pizza wasn't great. I ordered Fungi pizza which was good and had A LOT of mushrooms. It was yummy but I got tired of the flavour after 2 slices. It is a bit plain. All you taste is really mushroom and cheese. I think other pizza with meat and vegetables could have been better. I had Spicy chicken wings as well. The combination of grilled chives was excellent. Without the chives, it could be just a chicken wings. Medium spicy. It was good but nothing really special other than the chives
5
The food here is fantastic. Having been in SE Asia for so long, miss some great Italian food. If you have the craving for a great tasting pizza, look no further than here. Wide variety of flavors and options for many different tastes.

Fantastic pizza, that simply tastes like the real thing from Italy. Great restaurant, with a good atmosphere.
5
Great pizza that is done in stone fired style just right. Simple and authentic tasty pizza that you will want more. Pig's Ear MUST TRY! And leave room for the Dessert !

The taste of woodfired oven pizzas have that authentic and unique aftertaste, topped with fresh mozzarella cheese.
The bread was fresh, bit chewy but soft and thin crusted.
Substracting one star for a tad oily toppings and overall price.

Prices are fair but services really need to improve. Feels like they don't care if you're there or not.
The pizza is ok if you absolutely need a pizza even having so many options of food around you.
Nice salads tho

One would have thought that with a consequential sounding menu you would expect a decent meal, not the case at all..
Our entrées were with forethought dismal, subdued and drab..

We took a walk-in reservation on a Saturday evening for 1.5 hrs in advance. Ordered GoatCheese with baked lentils was starters and it was a great start. Lightly spiced lentils with cheese giving a kick. We then had a burrata cheese and tomato pizza. The dough was thin and crispy. I enjoyed every bite of this pizza! We realised we were not full, and went for a Stracchinno panini. I could identify the cheese, tomato, onion separately and none of the ingredients over powered the taste. cold pickled cucumber went well with it. Oh, and the sangria too was one of the better ones!All in all, we had 4 items and everything was bang on. Would love to come back here again

Maybe it is because i came to Singapore when the sterling is having a horror show but i could have been giving a 5 here if only i felt it was more reasonable... Pizza is not the same everywhere i get that and this is very good Pizza BUT it is still Pizza and it needs to be so so good to justify the cost (of the pizza and the wine). I was slightly pissed when the waiter suggested one of the most expensive wines and didn't seem to realise i was busy looking for the cheapest one there (of course due to the exchange rate!) so it took me a few goes to convince him i didn't want to spend more than Â£90 on a bottle.I will always come back when i come to Singapore and mainly because we share a name (or nickname in my instance) but i really hope the exchange rate improves for us brits or i might be on the water..

Touted as a celebrity chef joint with world famous pizzas. We were disappointed. The pizza was just standard- the tomato had a sweet and pickled taste in one and the pizza itself greasy.I also ordered the prawns al forno but again Just of standard quality.The staff were great and managed to get us a seat at a very busy time.Would not go again.
4
This is my third time at this restaurant. Once in Los Angeles, and twice in Singapore. The pizzas are very good, and the highlight is the dough which is very chewy. But overall I wouldn't say this is necessarily even amongst the top 20 pizzas I had. So it's worthwhile going but I wouldn't say it's a must
4
Came here with a friend 2 weeks ago after mum raved about it.
LOVED LOVED LOVED the pizza and salad we had.
Service was a little lacking. Not enough customer engagement though.
5
They had really good pizza!! Being from New York and having pizza in another country I would say it passed the test!!
5
I always try to have one meal at Pizzeria Mozza whenever I am in Singapore as they do amazing pizzas. My favourite is the Burrata cheese with slow roasted tomatoes and I can say it is one of the best pizzas I have ever had.
2
Read some good reviews about the pizza and wanted to give it a try while we were at MBS. But the pizza were way below our expectation. The appetizer and salad were not fantastic either. Service is by far the worst we have experienced. We were not able to get any service staff's attention for a good 10min...and yes....we were still charged 10% service charge in the end. One can easily get much better food in Singapore else where for the price. Noticed that many diners were there just to catch a quick bite cos the pizzeria is located near the theatre.
4
If you are looking for a "bar-like" atmosphere where you can enjoy a pizza during a shopping break or before going to show, this is an option. The wine menu is good and plentiful, but the appetizers were a little disappointing, especially for vegetarians. The wood-fired pizza is great (we had mushroom), but I would give the olive appetizer a miss (hot olives?!) Service was very good - at the bar. We got to the restaurant at 5:15 pm, and it was already too late to get a seat at a table. So call early - not just hours early, but DAYS early - if you want a "real" table. Prices reflect this restaurant's location at Marina Bay Sands: Expensive! We paid $30 for a regular size mushroom pizza. Expect to pay $100 or so for a bottle of wine. Would I go back again? Hmmm... maybe...
4
The wood fire pizza was excellent and they have a nice Italian wine selection. The service is excellent. The appetizer were the reason this wasn't a 5 star rating. In fact, I almost gave it a 3 star rating. No appetizers, then i would give this restaurant 5 stars
4
It is probably our fourth or fifth time here as well at the Osteria Mozza side but the last time we dined there was was probably about a year ago. The place is super convenient as it is just opposite the MBS theatre and since ours was a matinee, we needed a quick lunch before rushing for the show. Mozza opens at noon sharp leaving us with a short one hour time frame to go through our lunch but luckily, all went well. We made a reservation and I think that helped with the speed in seating us down and having our orders taken.We ordered the margherita pizza, the avocado, the tiger prawns and the lasagna which was one of the specials for the 3 of us (2 adults and one child). The pizza was delicious as always but the tiger prawns was a tad disappointing as it was nothing special. We had beer, latte go to along with the meal and with gelato towards the end as desert. The lasagna looked odd (due to the greenish pasta thing layering the in betweens) which I initially mistakenly thought was eggplant pieces. Nevertheless, we will overlook the odd greenish layering since it tasted yummy. The avocado salad was refreshing but the portion was too small for the price paid. We certainly enjoyed the bread basket (or bread in a brown bag) given to us after the orders were taken.Upon paying the bill, we rushed onwards to catch the show. It was only later on at the car park after the show did it dawn on us that we had forgotten to claim the free car park voucher which would be available if one were to spend beyond $75 for lunch at the selected restaurants at MBS. It would have been nice had the staff at Mozza enquired whether we had needed the car park redemption ticket.

Pizzeria Mozza easily has one of the most authentic Italian style pizzas in SG. Service here is swift and staff make the effort to check if you are rushing for the shows at the theatre when you order. Wet wipes are provided end meal as well. Food wise; a good selection of paninis, bruschetta, aperitifs and pizza.
4
With a cosy interior and friendly staff, this is a one of the few places in town serving good pizzas fresh from the wood fired ovens. Their starters are just as good and so is their drinks menu. Reservations are recommended as they are almost always full and being closest to the Sands a Theatre, a popular choice for pre-show meals too. It can be a little noisy with the crowds and close table arrangement but the dim lighting and good selection of songs on their playlist makes the meals very enjoyable

Had my dinner here. Heard that reservation should be made. Tried to do an online reservation but there was no space. Fortunately we called in and managed to get a place. You should be able to get a place if you have late dinner.Ordered a few appetizers. Portion is decent for small eaters. They were yummy! Really whipped up your appetite.We ordered a pizza. Decent portion for Asians. Service was prompt. The manager even changed my menu because I was holding a stained menu.Ambience was great. We had a seat by the walk way. Good spot for conversation and yet having soft music playing at the background. Should you sit near the wood fired oven, music might be louder and the place is darker.The food is generally flavorful. Will be back! Just that the food can be slightly salty, be warned
5
I've been here twice so far, and the pizzas have never disappointed. I usually go for the meat lovers pizza, being the carnivorous soul that I am!
The appetizers were fairly average in my opinion, but fresh nonetheless!
5
Better to book a table . Pizzas and Italian tapas are very good . Service is usually fast and efficient . Not the most romantic place to eat , but food and ingredients good quality . We will definitely eat there again.
5
Enjoyed very much the food and service. Really Italian style food and drinks. Worth the visit and the money
5
Started with Arancini which was tasty and ample to share followed with a salami pizza which was totally delicious with the amazing pizza base and just enough chilli followed with dessert. Best pizza i have ever eaten even better than pizza in Monza a few years ago ! Service was excellent a wonderful evenin
5
A place to go back to and again and again and again. Great music from we were much younger, attentive staff, great wines and amazing pizzas. The little pizzas they give you as a starter are also always a success. This is a must go but you need a reservation.
5
Yes, the pig's ears is always the 1st in my order list. Followed by cauliflower fritti and prosciutto di parma. End it with the lime cake and you're certainly in nirvana. Mozza is the go to if you miss Italy or probably before heading to the theatre. Book in advance so you won't be upset
4
We had to queue for a table, but only for 5 minutes. Well worth it. Service was fast and friendly. Wine kept in an ice bucket until we asked for it. Pizza was extraordinary; my fresh goats cheese, scrallions, bacon and garlic was, together with the most amazing airy crust, probably one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten, and I've had a few (thousand). Not cheap; 2 pizzas, 2 beers and a bottle of the cheapest house white came to â‚¬194. Five stars other than the price, in our money, over a hundred quid for a couple of pizzas, good as they were, a couple of beers and some wine, is pushing it a bit
1
Firstly, We have booked a table and we were there 30 minutes early. The waitress have check on the screen and look at me without giving me an instruction she knocks her head,walks away towards the sitting area, so I followed her behind. She told me off to wait at the counter... that was utterly rude. Secondly, I have ask to keep my friend's favourite cake foe her birthday which I have purchase and ask to been presented to my friend after dinner. The waitress told me they cant serve us the cake. Therefore, i suggested to her that could we even have the candle light up with the cake sitting in the box. "She replied that you could only celebrate birthday with our dessert menu. "I was really puzzled with this sentence. I didnt expect a italian resturant under the name of a hotel could give such a rule... People come to your hotel to celebrate at least some occasions or celebration. So what's the point of celebration if the birthday person do not get their favourite preference? After dinner, we also gotten our friend a roll of truffles chocolate in a metal box and when my friend was about to open the box the manager stop her and said there should be no outside food here. We were shocked and explained that it was her present (we are not eating the truffles chocolate there) and we didnt have the cake which you kept here at all. My birthday girl was disappointed. In all awkwardness, the manager came with an ice cream and a candle... We will just disappointed and can't wait to pay and leave this place...

Really good Pizza, but service very slow. My main course came at the same time as my sons, but then my wife had to wait ten minutes before her pizza came, not good !! Drinks expensive (that's true of all places in marina bay sands area. Enjoyed it, worth a call in, if you are in the area and don't mind ad hoc servic
1
This used to be my favourite couple of years back. I am amazed at how much the quality has deteriorated. Seriously, how difficult can a cheese pizza be.. Whatever fancy name you give it. And the day's speciality .. Some dish of lamb on Fridays... Seemed to be the worst dish of the day. Go there for ambiance and brand name. They still seem to be banking on once good brand name. If you are going there for good food.. Don't bother.
5
Great tasting pizza that reminded me of Rome and Florence. Book to reserve a table and definitely worth going to.
Pizzas had a nice thin base with crispy crust. You won't be disappointed!!!
2
Would not eat here again. Good was nothing special and took far too long to arrive. Very expensive for what you actually get.
4
I love pizza but struggle with a concept of a pizzeria in a shopping mall (unfortunately common in Singapore). This place is quite good but not cheap and often overcrowded.
4
Service is good. Food range is limited but the quality of food is important. Thumb Up for their " Special " pizza and chicken wings.
5
The Pizza here is incredible: great crust, tasty tomato, good toppings. However, better to look the other way when you are presented with the bill.
5
made reservations from our room at Marina Bay Sands so were seated immediately when we arrived. Goat cheese pizza and Margarita pizza both wonderful the service was with a smile and fast. thanks for a great dinner
5
It was my first visit, I'm not a pizza fan but seriously this place offers great pizza. I love the menu because they keep the pizza combination simple. It feels unpretentious and inviting. It was the burrata, tomato sauce and oregano that called out. And it was so good. The tomato sauce was intense and every bite felt so homey, comforting and authentic. (Imagine being transported into a traditional Italian home kitchen with its own wood fire oven where uncle or grandma churns out a thin crusted pizza with some basic pantry ingredients). Happy happy customer.
3
The place is popular so it was packed when we got there. Good thing we made reservations so we got seated right away. Service was excellent. Staff seemed knowledgeable about anything and everything Pizzeria Mozza. Congratulations!Overall, I enjoyed my Pizzeria Mozza experience but I think I might have to do that again and perhaps get something more adventurous than the goat cheese pizza we had. I also wish their pizzas would have less of that thick pizza dough at the edge. Their selection of wines though were really good.So yes, Pizzeria Mozza, I'm hoping to do that again with you.:
5
This place is always full whenever I walked past it, even till late hours. I managed to snag a seat at the side of the restaurant... only thing is that passer-bys like to look at what you are eating!There were too many choices of pizza and finally I settled for the recommended 16 inch Burricotta pizza with peperonata, olives and oregano. It was a bomb with a tangy and herbaceous taste. The soft cheese served as a spread that could well coat each bite I had! The fried pig's ears was a new experience for me. Crispy with a soft interior.Service was prompt and friendly
2
I brought my family to lunch there as compensation for not spending time with them for the Mother's Day. By now, my daughter is an expert in Italian pastas and she was not impressed. Too salty was her verdict. The other dishes were all a blur now ..
5
The pizza comes soaking in olive oil, the roasted tomatoes are incredible. I can't write much more as I start dreaming about it. Prices are OK, atmosphere is great. I would go back every week if I wasn't watching my waist line.
4
Walked in without a reservation on a Sunday in August. It was really busy and the service was a little bit slow. I had two starters instead of a pizza. I had the oven baked asparagus with prosciutto and parmesan and the arancini di riso alla bolognese. Both delicious. The pizzas looked good, I just wasn't in the mood for a pizza. The toilets there were very nice and clean.
4
The restaurant is located in the nice mall of the Marina Bay Sands. We had lunch here and ordered some salads and main dishes. The food was quite nice, not fancy, the staff was friendly and did their best to serve us promptly. So nice place for lunch
4
Price wise it is a little on the high side, but the pizzas are really good. I love a thin crust pizza and they do it so well here. They have plenty of side dishes that are well prepared. If only the staff are friendlier. They are polite, but twice I sat at the counter, and even when I do try to strike up a conversation with the cooks or show appreciation for their skills, they seem more focus on their tasks - I noticed orders kept coming, so maybe that's why. This was my third visit, and it won't be my last.

We made a reservation for lunch on Saturday at Pizzeria Mozza, and the staff were quick to respond to our email. As we were also celebrating a birthday, they advised that we can pre-order their birthday cake or a dessert with a candle on it.When we arrived at the restaurant, it was packed and we were promptly shown to our seats. There are diners sitting at the bar counter overlooking at the two wood-fired ovens.We ordered calamari al forno, the Bacon, Salme pizza and Proscuitto di Parma pizza. I informed the staff that I had pre-ordered a caramel copetta with a candle, and it was to be served after our meal, as a surprise for my guest who is celebrating his birthday. While waiting for our food, bread sticks were served to us. The pizzas are the best we had so far. We loved the parma ham on the pizza. The calamari unfortunately had quite a fair bit of gristle in it, which had to be spat out.After our meal, the dessert was served. The caramel copetta is really yummy, with salted peanuts and a waffle at the base.We had a wonderful meal at Pizzeria Mozza and we'll be back for more

We had dinner in Pizzeria Mozza ,in the Marina Bay Sands .This Italian restaurant was recommended by my associate .A dough crazy pizza foodie.The Pizzeria Mozza has a wood fired oven in the restaurant front.It is an attraction to watch freshly baked pizza coming out .The menu has a wide selection of salami , mozzarellas and array of wine .Appetiser was olive oiled spinach , grated cheese with anchovies.The freshly oven baked pizza with different toppings was great experience for me.We were served by an Argentinian waiter who guided us with the food and wine list. It was a wonderful dining experience .The special dough , Italian bakers and oven make it more memorable. The pizza were mama mia.

I have been here a few times as they are one of the first restaurants I think about when I do crave for an Italian fair. They are nice side bites like the pigs ear as well as the squash blossoms with ricotta cheese in it. The rest are a little common in my opinion. Pizza wise I feel that the crust is nice and their pizza are one of the better ones in town. Service here is slightly inconsistent and have to be improved, slightly slow to respond to guests. For me personally as a service provider, I have always felt that I have failed my job if a guests has to rise their hands to call for me moreover many guests raising their hands and looking around for service. Other than that, they are still one of the first few restaurants that comes to my mind for a decent Italian fair
3
I am crazy about Mario Batali food, so I expected a lot. The hawaian pizza was really delicious and I cant complain, but the service! Wao! Really really sucks and not only in my table, in almost all the tables that where around it. The hostess didnt Know the Word service. I cant believe this in a Batali restaurant
4
This place is pricey, almost too pricey but the pizza has got to be the best I've tried in Singapore. Go early or make a reservation prior or you have to wait really long.I've been here multiple times, and have always ordered the same pizza (because it's too good). I've noticed that the last time I've been there (Christmas 2015), the amount of burrata given was lesser than usual. Not sure if it was just that instance because of the festive period.Overall my experience here has been great; good service, great food
4
My family had lunch here and it was packed on a Monday. The pizza is very good, the antipasti we had were nothing special and kind of a let down considering the price. I would order the pizza and save space to finish my meal elsewhere
5
I went there with my kids an they loved the potato wedges and wood fire pizza...it taste was just perfect and the ambience just perfect...staff were very friendly and we had a good time..
5
I've been to Singapore for a few times already and this was one of the best dinning experiences I've had in the country. Great food from appetizers down to desserts. Very good service considering it was busy that night. Can't wait for my next visit.
4
Great food, great service and great atmosphere. A little expensive, but everything in Singapore isn't cheap. The Arancini balls are to die for and the Pizza had a great crust.
3
If you are on a shopping round in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall and you'd like a fine food don't miss the place. Pay a special attention to the goat cheese with lentil.
3
I know Singapore is an expensive place especially if you eat out at restaurants. This place charged $15 for small bottle of Peroni and $27 dollars for vegetarian pizza. It was a great pizza but after paying you feel a bit let down in terms of value for money. The service was not great and had to chase waiter to order drinks, meal and the bill. Won't be visiting again.
5
The restaurant is great, even for a solo diner. The front is open to the mall, so you can "people watch" while dining. While the prices are generally high (like nearly everywhere in Singapore), there is an afernoon lunch "menu" that includes a salad, pizza, and ice-tea for a reasonable price. I belive it's availabe from noon to 5 PM. As the other reviews note, the food is excellent as is the service so, afer days of Asian food, it is a really good choice for lunch
5
I had the pizza with proscuitto and arugula and was surprised and pleased with the amount of toppings. The pizza was not overwhelmed with sauce and cheese, but the main ingredients were allowed to shine. Service was excellent and friendly and no hidden add ons to the bill (unusual in Singapore, unfortunately). The home made mint basil lemon ice tea was terrific and the pizza was large enough that I was able to take some away with me for later
5
Really love the ambience & food at Mozza. The pizzas are absolutely fabulous! The Burrata pizza was melt in your mouth. Try the EggBacon pizza if you absolutely can't believe potatoes can be good on a pizza crust (it can be!). Fried squash blossoms... Mmm mmm mmm... Chicken livers... YUM... I could go on! Thanks to Christian and the wonderful Mozza team for making the night fantastic!
5
This pizza place is part of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. I ordered the egg pizza with potato among other things and it was really good. Also, ordered a side of ricotta which was excellent. When in Singapore, if you had your fill of local fare, this is a good Western alternative
5
We visited Garden by Marina park and after we feeled hungry.Marina Sand complex have food and more food available. But if you want super, super Pizza you must visit Mozza. We both have Pizza Picante with salami and mozzarella. That was easily my life's 63 years top 3 pizza with flying colors. Also they have good selection of special beers for my taste. Money well spend.Grazie Tutti
5
What a good place for dinner! Starters were great, pizza was amazing and desserts great a well!
Napolitana rocks!
(Great wine too!)
5
This is a favorite of my Grandson's and I liked the food here as well. It's a fun place with very good service.
5
The pizza is always good, worth your time to keep coming back. The tapas style appetizer are great. Quite crowded for dinner, make sure you reserve your seats first
5
Walking through the very impressive Marina Bay Sands, one would think this establishment offers food that is extremely pricey, but the prices are surprisingly quite reasonable.Dinner was a couple of antipasti and a pizza to share. The califlower fritti was tasty with his battered coat. The calamari was prepared quite differently. It was not deep-fried like how it is served in many places. However, its portion was a little meagre, in my opinion. The chicken wings was cooked with just the right amount of spices and interestingly presented with strips of pandan leaves. My personal favourite was the spinach salad sprinkled with ricotta cheese. The sourness of the leaves mixed with the sweetness of the cheese made for a perfect dish. The service was faultless, despite the restaurant being busy. We were constantly being checked on and attention was lavished on us.We will most certainly return
5
I am a local and come here mainly for special occasions. The food is top class. The pizza will take 15-20 minutes to be be made but every minute is worth it. They have fabulous dessert. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere created is wonderful
4
For starters I have to recommend this place solely on the fact that they were capable of accommodating our of our friends who has a serious nut allergy. In a country of many foreign foods coming together, being able to accommodate and serve her safely was a great starting point. The restaurant itself was very nice, offering a good date night vibe and pretty upscale for a pizza place. Our waitress was very attentive and helped make our food choices more enjoyable by suggesting another pizza when 2 that we selected had the same flavor profile.Overall it was a great evening for a double date just on the more expensive side

Pizzeria Mozza Eats and Treats ala-BataliWhat is a visit to Marina Bay Sands at the Shoppes is one doesn't well shop till one drops and have a meal in any one of its top notch gourmet havens? So, my wife and I were in Singapore recently and she booked online (smart woman) a table for two for us to have a light lunch developed by one of the most recognised and respected chefs in America today, Mario Batali, the Pizzeria Mozza to Marina Bay Sands. For starters, it opened promptly at noon. Second, we felt right at home as there were a couple of Filipino wait staff and was told even kitchen preparers. So, the foodie in us were seated as it was like, yes, we are in a familiar place, only it also serves wine and dough-obsessed pizza-lovers like us.Citi, our table attendant, took our Orders, my wife told me and she confirmed that the portions are for sharing. Meaning? Large. We ordered a green salad with ham, simple meat pizza and roast chicken. Appetizers were served consisting of crispy crackers with herbs. The salad arrived and true, it was meant to share. I dug in savoring the greens perfectly dressed with generous ham slivers and grated Parmesan cheese. Salad days can't come any better.The pizza with meat and Basil leaves or arugula as well as the roast chicken, seasoned with rosemary and other herbs giving it a distinct aroma --by the way, that day it was the lunch of the day -- had a side dish of spinach and Italian version of bread crackling. Delicious. We really enjoyed the lunch. We were having the times of our lives that lunch.Midway into our meal, I thanked my wife for the online reservation as the place was packed and likely unless a reservation was done, a customer will have to wait. So book ahead or be sorry.It was artisanal but simply satisfying a lunch, that perked us to continue to wander the expanse of the Marina Bay Sands shoppes. And did I get my just desserts: my wife had me carry her shopping bags while we wait for our ride back to the hotel
5
My late lunch at Mozza after checked-in into MBS hotel. I've heard of many good reviews of this restaurant and wanted to try it out this time. Indeed, pizzas that I ordered tasted superb! I will definitely go back again during my next visit in Dec
4
My wife and I visited Pizzeria Mozza after having visited Osteria Mozza, and I have to say whilst the restaurants are next to each other they have a very different feel. Pizzeria Mozza is a far more laid back experience.The pizzas aren't bad, but could be better, mozzarella and tomato salad was good, and a mixed meat panini was pretty good too, perhaps a little too full but good none the less. Desserts were good, I would recommend this place
4
The Pizza dough is probably made with buckwheat flour and/or whole wheat flour, it gives an extra crispy crust that may not please everyone but sets the dishes apart from other less daring pizzerias. The toppings are very generous and yes, the pizzas are expensive but worth it. Salumeria is very fresh, and the various cheeses imported from Italy (I would probably venture that even the mozzarella isn't an Australian copy). The place gets very crowded at lunch and quite noisy. The tables are close from each other and the wooden seats are just comfortable enough so you don't complain, but you don't want to linger there either. Only one thing is bad, IMO and that's the coffee, but I know from experience that coffee tastes are very wide and varied... Feel free to disagree. Servic
4
Excellent pizza- delicious thin crust- abundant pastas- great food served unpretentiously-- enough said
5
The best pizza, lasagna, and for sure the best ice cream and sorbet.
Delicious authentic Italian food and the staff super friendly !
YOU MUST TRY IT.
5
Went for their lunch special which was a good value. The pizza and salad were both excellent. Wine list was a little small.
4
Yum. The friend cauliflower was so crisp and tasty and the squash blossoms oozing home made ricotta. The pizzas were thin crispy and packed with flavour. Great ambience and attentive staff
5
The food was fantastic and a well rounded menu. There are daily specials. Can be a little crowded might be best to make reservations for larger parties
4
Atmosphere is great! Food is good and rustic, quick service but a little pricey.Whats good: meatballs, calamari is tender and right amount of salad acidity, the goats cheese lentils is different - u have to try it! Pizzas have thin bases and good flavour.Its a bit of a busy pizzeria with the big number of waiters and front of house staff - i think there are more workers than what they can seat in the house! Arancini balls my son demolished! He never used to eat arancini balls but this one he loved!
4
Had lunch at Pizza Mozza on a number of occasions and the food has been consistently good.The fried cauliflower is a favourite as is the spinach ricotta salad. The Buratta pizza tastes great. One pizza I did not enjoy was the Margherita. Too much tomato sauce and not enough cheese for my liking. To note also: there is no pasta dish on the menu.Prices are reasonable even though some items can verge a little on the high side for a pizzeria. Service is efficient. Overall, a good casual Italian restaurant. Not amazing but good
5
Finally learned why it is always packed. The food is amazing - it's cheaper than its adjoining sister, Osteria, but it's still premium priced. Crucially the visual pizza experience (you watch the entire process as it is made) matches the taste. Margherita was a stand out as was the mushroom one. Would go again. Be there 10-15 mins before it opens.
5
Aside from enjoying the local Singaporean food, I always make it a point to have a meal in Pizzeria Mozza. It consistently has great service and excellent pizza. The squash blossoms with ricotta cheese is my favourite appetizer and the all meat pizza never fails. Don't let the queue discourage you. Try eating by the bar and enjoy watching the happy chaos behind the counter
5
Try their pizza its amazing and their starters too were really nice.Great ambiance and very nice staff.Make sure to reserve before going as it gets really crowded some times.They also have a great selection of wines from all over the world.Highly recommended
5
Fabulous pizzas in a cute and relaxed setting. If you like your pizza sauce intense, this is the place to come! Good quality ingredients paired with great service, all in all a fab relaxed place to eat. Can't wait to go back :)
5
The pizzas are amazing !!! The best pizza that i have ever tried I carve it all the time. Considering the price in Singapore this place is very reasonable.
I highly recommend you try it when you are visiting Singapore.
5
Reasonably priced. fast service and great pizza. Nice break from shopping. They serve Thin crust pizza. Great selection of wine.
4
Good food, good service, good ambience. If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal this restaurant would tick the boxes. We tried his signature Fennel Sausage Pizza (pictured), really delicious.

Went with 3 adults and a baby. This place is always crowded so I recommend you book in advance. We were turned away the day prior at 6:40 pm when we tried to get a table at 7-7:30 pm.Note: If you have a baby with you, there is little space for a pram. This place has more of an 'adults only' vibe.We ordered two pizzas to share: burrata and slow-roasted tomatoes, and prosciutto di parma with rucola and mozarella. Burrata one has great balance of flavors, very tasty. Prosciutto was okay, I've had better of this variety in Singapore. Mozarella was absent from what I could see and the prosciutto was oily. Pizza dough is great, tomato base lovely, al forno baking perfect. We had the house special for Tuesdays which is crispy duck leg with lentils. The lentils steal the show: lovely texture and flavors. The duck leg was okay. For drinks I recommend the house made ice teas, which we had along with some rose. We spent about $160 for all this.Service was adequate if a bit too attentive and rushed. Staff eye your plate when you've been sitting for a while. A palpable 'this one out - next one in' mentality exists. As a fancypants celebrity chef restaurant, a more elegant approach is suitable and desirable.Close to 4/5 stars but in reality not quite

Go for pizzas, its amazing and the ambience is really nice too. You have to book for dinner and on weekends, as it gets busy, however great veg option for those that dont eat meat! Oh the mocktails, i think i had basil, mint and lemon, wow- that was awesome
4
The crust they use in their pizzas is very different and it was delicious! We got a white pizza and a regular pizza and both were amazing. However Marina Bay is a bit far from everything so I wouldn't say its necessarily worth driving here but if you are shopping or in the area then go by
2
Maybe its just the way Singaporw is but the staff here is incredibly bad. The menu is basically just pizzas which although are pretty good but the whole dining experience was a let down due to the poor service.The pizzas came quick but when we tried to order more pizzas they would just deny saying you should have ordered eaelier as now its difficult to keep your table occupied to serve you another pizza.Are you frikkin joking? And I thought this was a Michelin Starred chef restaurant.They forgot our lemonades and when we reminded them of it, "its almost the end of your meal and it would take me another 20 minutes to get it,would you rather cancel the order" So yep,would not recommend to dine here if you don't want to spoil your mood and pay for expensive food

We had no reservation but they managed to find us some seats at the bar which was nice. Our waitstaff were very efficient to the point of giving us the feeling that we were being encouraged to hurry up and eat and get out of there so they could get the next customers in. This is not to criticize the waitstaff as they were, as said, incredibly attentive but could dial it down a notch to make the experience more enjoyable. The wood fired pizzas were nice. I can see why people rate it highly but in Oz we have been spoilt with many great wood fired pizza restaurants for years so for us was just a nice enough meal at a reasonable price for the location i.e. in the Marina Bay Sands complex. If you are craving wood fired pizza in Singapore you should be satisfied by the offerings of this place
5
The pizzas here are delicious! The flavors and taste bring me back to certain parts of Italy. It is not overly priced (considering it's in MBS), averaging $30 a pie. Very good quality at an extremely reasonable price. Do not confuse this place with Osteria Mozza next door as the prices are HUGELY different.
5
The food was perfect from start to finish. Everything was delicious. Highly recommended. We had a great pizza for the main course and a couple of very tasty deserts.
4
visited here with my husband. he had a pizza and i had the roasted eggplant. very nice! music was a bit too loud though.
4
Was in Marina bay sands with the family and in mood for Italian food.Walked in for dinner without reservation but fortunately had space at the Pizza bar where you could see how they made the pizza.Ordered few different dishes and was satisfied with the taste.Only drawback THEY DONT SERVE PASTA.Service was excellent by the warm staff though the price of the dishes is on the higher side but worth it.Overall would rate it at 9 out of 10......
5
We had dinner here with our 2 children aged 2 and 4 in April. The were able to squeeze us in without a reservation.We ordered all our food from the share menu which was all so good! We eat out quite a bit at home, so are used to receiving good food and good service.This restaurant excelled in both of these areas! Our kids also loved the food (the aranchini was very popular!)My husband and I requested espresso martinis which weren't on the menu, but the bar staff were more than happy to make them anyway and they were perfect!If you want a delicious meal and drinks with great service, this is the place to go
1
First time in my life that I had a fried pizza. Even my Italian friends could not believe it. As a rule of thumb, don't go to a restaurant in which none of the waiters and Chefs are from the country represented by the restaurant, and this was no exception. Tourist trap
4
Made reservations for a birthday dinner - arrived pretty much on time and was seated immediately. Its weird how they ask if you're eating pizza or pasta and seat you based on that - pizza to the right and pasta to the left. Very very strange as in a large group people might want to eat a mix! Either way we went with Pizza and were seated in the middle of a packed restaurant - so packed that you might feel that everyone is eating together on one giant table. They need to leave space between tables as its quite annoying!Next we come to the staff - the front desk is rude. period. The serving staff is alright.Food - great! Guess thats why all the above mentioned negatives seem okay to deal with. Their pizza's are thin crust, freshly made and full of the authentic Italian flavours. Their fresh mozzarella is fresh, soft and delicious. Dessert are great too!Its expensive - for example - a dinner for two with a glass of wine will cost around $100 but its yummy
4
We came to Mozza almost every other week when we have cravings for pizzas. Restaurant is always crowded; especially on weekends so please make your reservations. Service is efficient and warm. They previously served some cheesy snacks but recently they stopped serving that due to wastage as some customers do not eat them (that was the reason provided by one of the waitresses). The pizzas are always amazing; crispy and tasty crusts with delicious toppings. My personal favourite is the Napolitana. Simply delicious! And also try the caprese for starters
5
One of my fave pizza places here in Singapore. Worth every penny. And wonderful service from their staff all the time. My usual staples is their Margherita and Eggplant pizza. But make sure you make necessary reservations before coming here during holidays and weekends as they can be really packed and wait list is long
4
This very elegant pizzeria in this super elegant shopping mall in Singapore.. Where I had the pizza of my life.The restaurant is very elegant, our waiters were very friendly. And the food was great. The bill was however the least enjoyable part of the whole experience. thats the only reason I didnt rate 5/5 or even 6/5.. yes it was that good.But to be honest, when someone expects such a level.. one should expect that it comes with a price. After all, Singapore is one very expensive countr
4
So I really liked the atmosphere and the buzz in Mozza. It's in the magnificent Marina Bay Sands complex and is very French bistro/Rome pizzeria in its decor. Great lighting and some great old tunes!Most of the food was pretty good too, especially the pizzas which have a super thin, crispy base and juicy toppings. The "diavolo chicken wings" we're a bit big and not anything like "buffalo wings" (in case that's what you're after). The arancini balls in a bolognese sauce was more "tomato sauce" and a bit bland. Peroni is $15 a bottle. And the service was a bit hit and miss. It started great and then got sparse and then neglectful. We had to chase down the bill in the end even though we'd been asked to vacate the table by a certain time. All up, it was an expensive early dinner although there were good bits and we mainly enjoyed the food. There's a "posher" restaurant on the flip side of the pizza bar that also left looks classy so would go back to try that next.
4
I was brought here by my colleagues, and it was good!
especially we were craving for cheese and wine, and this place has both.
Love the burrata cheese...
4
Calamari starter is a good recommendation, but pizza is the best, good service and friendly staff, enough wine options. Favorite italian restaurant in Singapore !!
4
Mozza offers a good variety of well executed pizzas. Strong flavours with a crust exhibiting superior texture to many other joints around town. Daily pasta is good, especially the pork & beef lasagne. Salads and desserts are competent as well. Clearly on the pricey side but worth the experience. Still one of the best if not the best place for pizza in the country
5
I ate in this pizzeria twice without reservation, but I think that's only possible if you're solo. I sat both times at the 'pizza bar' right in front of the ovens, which is interesting to watch. The pizza quality is gorgeous and worth the price of S$30. The second time I ate there I got a special dish as a gift from the chef. Tap water is free and the staff is very nice
2
Even after making reservations and being called by the restaurant to see if we were on our way we still had to wait a good 15min to be seated. It took 10 minutes just to be asked if we had a table.I like thin crust pizzas but this pizza was just to stiff to enjoy
4
Although we arrived without a reservation the hostess was able to seat us within a few minutes at a table in the pizzeria. The pizzeria and adjacent osteria were both busy. We chose a bottle of wine suggested by server. It was a fairly decent and enjoyable Italian red wine. We decided on shared appetizers of green salads, eggplant parmigiano and caprese. The Green salads were generous portions of freshly prepared greens. The eggplant was delicious but the caprese was a tiny serving of mozzarella about the size of a small 25 cent coin. Hardly worth $19. The pizzas followed and were good sized individual pizzas and freshly prepared in pizza ovens in full view of dining patrons. We ordered ice cream and tiramisu for dessert. Both items were tasty and enough to share. We enjoyed our meal and service was ok
5
Wanted to have a pizza in Singapore, and while in MBS mall had a chance to have lunch in this lovely restaurant which ends up to be as I call it "Little Italy in Singapore", very nice pizza's they have straight from the over which was fabulous and the taste is awesome.Don't miss it if you are around the area
3
Finally got to try pizzeria mozza after such a Long Long time since its opening at Marina Bay Sands. Service is pretty good and the staff are very polite and attentive to our needs. They refilled our empty cups promptly each time and took efforts to explain the dishes to us when ordering. The starters of grilled calamari and prawns were great and tasty which I will highly recommend. However, I thought the pizzas (mushrooms and the mozza-made meatballs ones) were decent but won't call it superb or must-try. Regardless, If u haven't try pizzeria mozza , please do as the above are purely my comments from trying various other Italian pizzeria in Sg and also overseas. You may like pizzeria mozza! Reservation is definitely a must as they are often running a full- house.

I tried several types of pizza, salad & dishes. Some of the best menus are Crisp Duck Leg, Fried potatoes, Wings Diavola & Spinach salad. The Duck leg was so tender & juicy. Fried potatoes served with some sort of leaves chop which were aromatic & make the dish so special. The wings diavola is sweet and a little spicy. Spinach salad.. I can't tell what they used, but it just uniquely delicious. While the rest, especially pizza, I have to say, not so special..Oh, the service was awesome, the waitresses were friendly & helpful. They helped recharging phone battery! Saves me
2
Ordered a number of pizzas, and all were both too salty as well as being smothered in tomato paste; I did not matter what the pizza was, the tomato paste taste was overwhelming. For the price they charge (an average of S$30 per pizza), these ought to be better. Service is so-so; the largely Filipino staff was polite enough, but seemed to go through the motions. The place is buzzing, and the atmosphere is good. Still, try other items apart from the pizzas, which unfortunately are part of the restaurant's name, although they shouldn't be. Ah, yes: and if pay with a credit card which requires a PIN for verification, be prepared to walk to the cashier to input your PIN; the restaurant still does not have a portable device to allow you to pay at your table! Overall, with a large choice of other food outlets in the same mall, this one is worth skipping
3
First time excellent, best pizza I had ever eaten..
Second time it was burnt and thats not what you expect when you pay a hefty premium.
What can I say....
3
The food here was pretty good compared to other places in Singapore ... but that still isnt saying much. The setting was too dark and lines were sometimes long. Pizza was over worked and wine was OK.
3
Good enough pizza quality for the money. Very crowded on weekends. The service is average as well. It can get quite noisy if the restaurant is full. In my opinion nicely executed but far from impressive.
4
Very busy and famous, situated in Marina Bay Sands, this restaurant offered some good options for vegetarians. We tried the garlic bread (under Bruschetta section), Monza caprese and Napolitana Pizza (very salty).
4
Been here twice in the past year. We order pigs ears each time. Its fried in strips and comes with a great slightly spicy sauce. We love their pizzas and how they are cooked right in the open. The ingredients are fresh. However, they are a little heavy handed with the salt. The first time, we tried the Burrata. The second visit, we had Bloomsdale and Fennel Sausage. The Fennel Sausage is a tad heavy and oily.We also tried the lasagne al forno which we found superb! Very light with many layers and good amount of beef. My mother-in-law (who makes mouthwatering and delicious lasagne) was also impressed with the lasagne al forno.The service however is a little sketchy. We had to request for chilli flakes several times before it was served and the staff mixed up our order once. We were also presented with the bill but the staff did not seem interested in following through with our payment! Notwithstanding the sketchy service, we are likely to revisit when pizza craving strikes again
3
I had a craving for pizza and ended up at mozza. The pizza is a bit too dry for my liking and for what it is the price is expensive. We did get complimentary croquettes as they had to redo one of the pizzas. Service is good.
4
Pizza is pretty good! They have good starters too. Their food is really good but it's a MUST that you save space for their dessert. I highly recommend their S'mores Gelato Pie. It's to die for! Probably the best s'mores dessert I've ever had. The place is nice. Typical busy pizzeria but I am really impressed with the staff. Very friendly and efficient. You'll enjoy this place. Although I wouldn't recommend this for a first date place because it pretty noisy so it's hard to really converse with someone you're trying to get to know. I suggest you call them for reservations since it almost always full.
4
Chef Mario Batali, you have consistently treated us well with Babbo and Del Posto in NYC so I was really excited to learn about your Asian outfit in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the casino stretch of Marian Bay Sands. But, unlike its counterpart restaurants in LA and his outlets in New York, this Mozza is really really really dark. The lights were almost non-existent, you know that there's a problem when every customer has to switch on their phone lights just to read whats on the menu
2
Nothing to rave about. Came here once and had a terrible experience. Pizzas are really poor quality and everything was so salty, the chefs have heavy hands. They offered us exchanges but it was not any better, in fact even the salted caramel ice cream was TOO SALTY. The whole visit was a joke. Service was good though
2
In their defence, the staff were good, the food came out quick, and the pizza base was really delicious. However, too many other things fell flat. I got a 'picante' pizza that was totally devoid of spice. The tomato sauce was very sweet, don't know what they're going for here. Dessert was alright, overpriced tiramisu which had been drenched in rum so that no other flavour came through. 130 dollars for two pizzas two desserts and soft drinks. Ha, I wouldn't recommend it. Hit the cheap eats in the market stalls downstairs.
4
Beer and pizza go together like...beer and pizza. Very popular, full of the 'hey, look at me crowd' with more cleavage than a go go bar. Singapore in a nutshell.
4
This is our 4th visit,but quite disappointed with the quality of pizza this time. Both our pizzas were served lukewarm. I guess this is what happens when the restaurant is full, but still no excuse for such a location in a 5 star hotel/mall.
2
Great food but very disappointing service why because the waitress took our plates folks/knives away while our daughters were still eating. What a lousy feeling!
4
Pizzeria Mozza has a great youthful vibe about it - the restaurant exudes a certain buzz coupled with cheerful, attentive and prompt service. Needless to say, the pizzas are the highlight but the salads and appetizers are decent too, especially the deep fried pigs ears - definitely a must order! Not cheap at all, considering it's just pizza, and over $30 for a small portion of lasagne, though it was very well done
5
Mozza scores full marks on many fronts. Their pizzas are not expensive, yea they may be priced higher than chain pizza joints but for the quality it is unbeatable! Speaking about quality, it is flawless; the dough is amazing, lightly burnt and fluffy. The toppings seem to be of the highest quality.Came here for a few pizzas with some buddies and we had 1 pie each. It didn't break the bank and we all left happy campers.
4
Went there without making reservation, it was lucky to have a table. They only gave us the option to choose the Pizzeria or Osteria Mozza's table - once we had chosen, there was no cross-ordering. The reservation lady didn't seem to have a smile on her face, perhaps she had a rough day. She made it very clear that she only took us to the seat and she wouldn't take order - the waiters/ waitresses were responsible to take order later.Food menu was expensive and it was expected because of the restaurant in Marina Bay Sands and we were after the food quality. We ordered:Antipasti - Prawns al forno with potato & salsa romesco $19Prosciutto di Parma $20Funghi misti, fontina, taleggio & thyme $30Those were all great quality order with small portion. Personally I really enjoyed the wood fire Funghi Pizza with generous funghi toppings. Make sure you make reservation to avoid long queue/ disappointment because it's easily full house. It was a lovely environment for friends catch up
4
Nice buzzy atmosphere. Quick turnarounds. Fun cocktails and beers. FANTASTIC PIZZAs - all the usual suspect with a gourmet twist and some interesting change-ups as well. But be forewarned, you will be paying between $25 to $35 for a pizza (before tax) - so it's not a light on the pocket.Great for a relaxed quick bite at any time. Could do with a little more staffing during peak periods
4
We went to Mozza on V day. Brunch menu was perfect for us. Very good quiche and do try the fish patties on the brunch menu. It was sea bass or something when we were there. I'm not sure if this changes with the season. Service was prompt and crew was attentive. Mozza is known for its pastas and the goat cheese ravioli will be next on my list when I visit again
4
Pizza that I would go back for again and again, this place is always crowded over the weekend and if you think you wanna make a impromptu visit think again. Do call to make reservations. Have been here a couple of times and they always churn out delicious hot piping pizza with quality ingredients but I always find the pizza a tad too salty for my liking luckily the waitress knows my usual order so she will let the chef know to tone down on the savory stuff. I suggest sitting near at the walk way looking out if you like people watching otherwise sit inside for a more intimate dinner. Cheer
4
Most of the time full place. Things that I didn't like, restaurant separate in 2 parts. One for risotto, main course another pizza. I can choose only one area where to be. U can't ask to bring u spaghetti from another side. For my point of u stupid idea. If they try to be special, then put this 2 restaurants on a distance, so it wouldn't be confusing. Pizza was not bad, but not the best. Most of all I enjoy friendly stuff, that has good recommendations and amazing desert. My point of view a bit overrated place.
5
Both the Pizzeria and Osteria outlets were full - must be among the more popular places in MBS. But service didn't suffer. Kudos to the cheerful, accommodating staff. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.
4
The pizza is not Italian but an American style, very thin but the crust is too crispy and oily, like deep-fried, difficult to explain, though it's still one of the best places for pizza in Singapore.
5
A must visit if you looking for a classic pizza within the mall! We came here after the wall at the Gardens by the bay!
3
Pizza is quite nice but skip the overpriced average starters. Dessert is not bad but I don't think 20 dollars for an above average tiramisu is worth it.
5
Mmmmmmm! Really different. Very exquisite. You get the kick in every bite, from mouth watering starters to amazingly crispy pizzas to heavenly Tiramisus!!! I'd live there if I can. Chef Mario Batali, you are from a different planet!
4
I went restaurant for may birthday the pizza we ordered was Delicious and fast service.
and it was quite bigger than I expected.
But I think if they serve the pickle with pizza it would be better :)
I would like to visit again anyway
4
We went for veg pizza and bruschetta. There was visible difference in items. It felt authentic Italian. We were used to Indian flavours but i knew how Italians made their pizza. You can be sure to get that here. Recommend this place to all.
3
The place is ok , inside a big shopping mall , but don't expect real Italian food, is a kind of mix taste americanized italian with asian influences....I see that most of the people like it , but it will not suit a proper italian dinner for italian
3
A fair number of Malaysians & Singaporeans told us we must eat here when we visit Marina Bay Sands - and so we did. Popped in for lunch on a weekday, approx 1:40 when the lunch rush has come & gone.Complementary Parmesan crisp snacks - salty, crispy and tasting nicely of Parmesan; everything you want in a little bite whilst perusing the menu. We thought this was a great start - unfortunately, that was the tastiest part of the entire lunch.Cauliflower fritter - crispy in a light tempura like batter. It was tasty but lacking a wow factor. Squid with chickpeas - again, the squid was tasty enough but we wondered if something was missing. The chickpeas were, unfortunately, slightly underdone. Mixed salad leaves in oil - decent enough for what it isNapolitano Pizza - pizza with tomatoes, basil, olives, capers. A classical pizza which should allow the ingredients to shine. Decent enough pizza but once again, where is the wow factor. We are not saying it was a bad meal as it definitely was not. However, we expected something more for $100 Singapore dollars for the above and 1 large bottle of sparkling water. When we reflected on the meal a few hours later, the better half summed it up very nicely - 'meh' (with a shrug) and expensive
2
My wife and I went for dinner last night. The restaurant was very busy. We ordered a Napolitana pizza and the dish of the day which was a chicken Milanese. Service was attentive and courteous. The pizza came relatively fast. I had mixed feeling eating it. The toppings were fresh and tastefull but the dough was very disappointing and the size of the pizza was quite small. The chicken dish was a very small portion (1/2 a breast) served only with a few roquette salad leaves. No pasta, nothing coming with it for $25, a rip-off for sure. With only two soft drinks our total bill was 70$ and we were still hungry
5
Managed to get a reservation for Mozza for girlfriend's surprise dinner with friends and definitely was not let down by the service and quality of food. Great ambience and we all had a good time. Lemon birthday cake was absolutely delicious. Will be back again.
4
The pizzas, olives ol forno and caprese salad are my favourite. You cannot possibly go wrong with the rosemary potatoes too! Love the food and never get tired of going :)
4
Real Italian pizza in Singapore , nice place friendly staff and very warm atmosphere with a flavor of Europe .. We loved it
2
This place is very expensive and the pizzas are not very good. The crust is pretty good, but the sauce and toppings are bland. Beer is also by bottle only and expensive. I don't mind paying extra for good quality and flavors, but this place needs to step it up.
5
A great place to chill with great food, good service and fairly good price considering the location. We ordered Prawn al Forno, Lasagne Al Forno & Meat Lover Pizza; complimented with wine of course.... Everything was delicious. The staff were all friendly, warm and efficient, treating us as special guests completed the excellent dining experience. I highly recommend this place.
4
My Wife Daughter and I went here for dinner on my Wife's birthday. I ordered the asparagus and prosciutto as antipasti - the prosciutto was excellent - just the right thickness, right level of saltiness and very soft. We ordered the citrus pomegranate avocado salad which was quite good too -Great combination of citrus and rocketta salad leaves.The pizza was very good - my Wife is beg and hence we went for the aglio olio pizza with extra mushrooms - the pizza base was very fresh and tasted excellent.Waiters were all very very friendly and seemed to know exactly when our dishes would come when we checked - very efficient tooAll in all a great experience. Would recommend
3
Fine pizzas but the antipasti were expensive smallish side dishes at $15 to $19 and desserts were equally overpriced as well at $16(?!!) to $19(?!!). The place is also too dimly lit that one can hardly read the menu. Like I said, fantastic pizzas but I'm not sure the place is worth it
4
Me: I like my NY/New Haven style thin-crust pizza. Good tangy, San Marzano sauce, minimal toppings.Mozza: Bread maker, Nancy Silverton, who is also a co-owner obviously shines here. She has brought her A game to Mozza Singapore. The crust is fabulous. Thin, crust ends, and slighty chewy middle. My favorite pizza was the Napoletano - capers, olives, anchovies, no cheese on a tomato sauced pie. nice. a little salty for some in my party, but perfect for me.The other pizzas - brussel sprouts, burrata, meat,... where okay, but when you start adding brussel sprouts and things like that, you start looking and tasting a little bit like a California Pizza Kitchen (don't get me wrong Mozza was NOT CPK, even Mozza's most non-standard pies were good, just not great). When you load too much on the pie, it takes away from the crust - the crust gets a little softer/wetter in the middle.This is probably the best pizza I have ever tasted in Asia, hands down. The sauce was a tad sweet on some of the pies, and some of the toppings were too much (keep it simple Mozza), but all in all, if you want a pizza fix, this is the ONLY place to do it in Asia
1
I ordered a spinach pizza (with salami and egg) and boy! the spinach in particular was very salty, made my whole palette very uncomfortable. But because it was the 1st time I ordered this, I thought that was just the standard so I didn't complain. My friend came afterwards and ordered her favourite Funghi Misti but to her disappointment, the pizza was incredibly salty too. I tried it myself and realised the saltiness was in the mushrooms, and we feedback to the manager.Instead of responding objectively, she was extremely defensive:1) She commented it must be because there was too much cheese. We said no, we don't think it is the problem with the cheese because we can tell the whole pizza was just oddly too salty.2) She claims she has been selling this since morning and no one complained.Excuse me? Just cos no one complained doesn't mean there is nothing wrong.3) We told her her response was very defensive, but she skirted the topic and maintained no one complained. We didn't want to argue so decided to let it slide.4) After we paid for the bill, another waitress served us our change and told us we had TWENTY CENTS change. We were appalled with the attitude! (in any case, the waitress had mentioned a wrong amount) All in all. I am terribly disappointed with the level of service at this restaurant, it is sorely lacking. I certainly expected a little better from MBS. My friends and I agreed we are never coming back! Didn't think we did anything to deserve this kind of poor treatment
5
Nancy Silverton, Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich meld their prodigious talents to bring Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza to the heart of Singapore at The Marina Bay Sands. One of the best places in Singapore to have wood fire pizza. Not only do we love the pizza but we love the warm hospitality too. It is a good place to have a family Sunday brunch. We chose the Mussels al forno with salsa calabrese for starters, followed by Napolitana and Margherita. For dessert we had the 3 different gelato which is Caramel, Espresso and Vanilla and the Caramel Copetta. We LOVED the Caramel Copetta. Dad loved it too. The gelato was served with thin and crispy wafer which Dad loved and asked for extra serving. We ordered 2 more and the Chef gave an extra one more for Dad. So sweet, right. It was a great dining experience for us and we will definitely return. Thank you to all the awesome peeps at Pizzeria Mozza
5
The place is based in MBS, very crowded and busy but has a great ambiance. Food is stunning and delicious, staff- friendly, very efficent and professional. Pizzas are just beautiful!
5
The pizza in here is delicious but also probably the most expensive in Singapore. Alcoholic beverages also very expensive. Sometimes when I've been there's been an hour wait for tables so would certainly book ahead.
4
We are vegetarians and tried the Pizzas and the starter dish of Olives. the squash starter with burnt butter and almonds was nice too. Dessert was apple with gingerbread, yumm. quite crowded even at 6:00pm for dinner on a weekday. Better to reserve a table
5
One of our favorite places in Singapore, must book and best to eat outside of peak times as it can get noisy. The chopped salad is a meal in its self and the pizza so nice , no over the top toppings , lovely thin crust.Great place for something to eat before or after a show. Actually just a great place to grab a bite and watch the world go by
5
We didn't realize there was a celebrity chef at this restaurant until later but given that another famous restaurant had a hour wait we went to this one and got right in my. We had a very nice server and our margherita pizza was good. We ordered wine but it never came out and so they brought it to us as we were planning to leave for free. It was a good meal
5
On a crowded Saturday evening, it did not take us long to get a seat for 4 people. We were lucky to have walked faster than the crowd behind us :-).Having tried other Italian pizza places before, I can say that this place is value for money, not just because the pizza is fantastic, but the service is superb as well! Highly recommended if you are craving for Italian pizza
5
We visited the restaurant and really enjoyed it ! The food is genuine and so tasty and fresh it really does have a real italian influence , so far one of the best here.: the ambiance is lovely and staff are so.nice and friendly ! We will definitely be back as it was one of the best pizzas i ever tried !
5
We have been here several times and it's something you can recommend to anyone, unless they're looking for a romantic and quiet place where you can whisper into your girlfriend's ear. This place is hip and trendy, with music of Springsteen, Simple Minds, most of it last Saturday was from the 80s and 90s and last time was no different. The music is a little bit loud so it's quite noisy to say the least. Still, they serve you some free appetizers which are fantastic. We had some squid as a starter where the only disappointment was its size. It could have been a bit bigger, especially as it tasted that good. I had then a salami and mozerella pizza and my wife prosciutto and rucola pizza. Both were absolutely delicious. These have to be among the best pizza's you've ever eaten. So book ahead because it's always full and there's a reason for that: its pizza's are unbeatable
4
It was a dinner treat for 2. Love the pizza and squids. Interesting desserts but not overly impressed. It was a good place for dinner, quit bustling with activities. Saw families there too. Lighting was abit dark for a family dinner but suited for couples or friends.
3
I had an office event couple of months ago and I was pretty impressed with the food. However, when I visited them again last month, this time with my husband, I was utterly dissappointed. We had ordered for margarita pizza. First off, most part of the crust was burnt. Secondly, the tomato puree was too tangy, it felt like eating a hard loaf with tomato spread. How can a restaurant who specializes in Italian food go wrong with margarita pizza!??Not going again.
4
Nice and really crowded place. Great service, attentive, friendly and fast.
Superb pizzas. Excellent dough with superb crusts.
5
The burrata was our of this world, wow. I ordered the napolitan pizza, which was excellent. By far the best pizza i have ever had.
4
Went there for a working lunch with colleague. Pizza is American style which is thin and crispy. Also enjoyed the grilled asparagus but not so much on the sea bass main course.
Friendly staff, good vibe. Will come back again when I'm visiting Singapore.

Sitting next to its more expensive sister, Osteria Mozza, it's much better value for money, with a similarly high quality. The pizza is great and the smaller items to share can fill you up very quickly. Added to this, you can easily order from Osteria's comprehensive wine list. One of my best wine pairings ever was when we allowed the Osteria sommelier free reign to pair with our Pizzeria meal (with some price limits). The choices were incredible and unbelievably unique. Skip the fine dining option and head for some quality pizza

Dinner with friends at Mozza was simple great , staff seems very happy to be there and assist guests plus is very well train with great knowledge of menu. Customer service attention to details superb.Atmosphere at restaurant great ,speed of service -tick ,food -tasty ,tick Highly recommended

Had a really great meal at Mozza. We shared a pizza, chopped salad and some starters. It was more than enough food and really nice. Not too expensive either which can be the problem at Marina Bay Sands. Personally I wouldn't choose the calamari starter again, it's 17 dollars for 2 skewers. The taste is great but the skewers were connected so it was a little difficult to share

Worst pizza I have ever tasted, I spent 8 years making pizzas in a classy Italian restaurant in Australia to be served a Margarita pizza with cheese and Nap sauce no actual tomato for $30sg come on. Th dough was fresh but wow wow just because your in a nice mall you can not serve up that. The margarita pizza for me is the true indication of amazing pizza because their is only one topping the tomato the secret is the dough and sauce but for me they failed and didn't hit the mark 1/5 the 1 was for the fresh doug

We are regular visitors to Mozza after stumbling upon it one evening. The food, staff, service and setting are amazing. It's a great place to experience pizza done right! The staff were really helpful in recommending a pizza for me (I can't eat cheese) and were not fussy about my dietary requirement. They even thought to check if I could have other types of dairy when we ordered desserts. We are already planning our Christmas eve dinner there :

$30 for a pizza - any pizza - is just absurd. But Mario knows what he's doing, and he can command whatever price he wants because he knows the quality of the food he serves.My first trip to Mozza was for a birthday dinner - we split the caprese salad (with burrata, Lord almighty it was good), devoured the spinach salad (don't skip over the amazing salad menu!), and split two pizzas - mushroom and margarita - which filled our bellies and tantalized our taste buds.Would I come back again? Sure, if I was riding high on the hog and had some bucks to blow. You can't beat the people watching at Marina Bay Sands, and the Pizzeria is a (slightly) cheaper way to enjoy Mozza's amazing cuisine. Definitely a worthy stop
4
Noisy, moody, full to the brim, 80's tunes blaring. But the pizza sings. As though we're in down town Napoli. The base is the highlight. Crisp, yet squishy, chewy, thin but not too thin. Proper buffalo mozzarella, on a home made passata base. Italian salad of salami, shredded cabbage et al also delish. Staff are tops. Efficient, yet embracing of the kids. Really good
5
I definitely recommend reserving as the que can be quite long if you go during lunch or dinner times. This is a fabulous eat and they have a lovely selection of wines too. Pizza is very authentic and they use good ingredients.
5
The more relaxed restaurant right next to the Ozzeria Mozza, really nice for beer and pizzas. There is not many options, but they are very good.
5
Pizzeria Mozza has one of the best pizzas in all of Asia. On my most recent visit I tried the white anchovy pizza. This is a pizza with no cheese! The crust at Mozza is unparalleled - and for the white anchovy pizza they top that crust with wonderfully fresh tasting tomato sauce (more like a jam really) red onions and very high quality white anchovies - these are not the dark soft salty anchovies you see on most pizzas- they are bright, somewhat toothsome (for an anchovy) and wonderful. This was far far better than I could have ever imagined a pizza without cheese could be. Wow. Also, check out the Brussels sprouts- really addictive
5
Pizza is always a good choice and what a better way to have it than here, a very nice setting, great ambiance and always friendly. We notices there is a lot of people for lunch and dinner. Pizza was great with a bottle of red wine. Service was friendly as well.I recommend you to book as it gets crowded
5
We were walk-ins here for a late lunch, sharing two pizzas and a bottle of white wine between four people. If you were hungry, suggest ordering a pizza per person. It presents a similar vibe to the other Mozza restaurants around the world and the food here is excellent.We were afforded a great view of the pizza bar, watching the chefs prepare and cook our food. The ingredients are so fresh and of excellent quality. The pizza bases are thin, light and balance the right amount of crispness and chewiness. We ordered a classic margherita as well as the goats cheese with leek, scallions and bacon. So, so good.Service here is ok and the food more than makes up for it. The price of wine here is expensive, but then again, wine prices are overly inflated in Singapore
5
Much different from the original italian one but really good! The oven is a mix of gas and wood, 4 different chef work on your pizza at different stages but the result is worthy! It is really not cheap compared to what you pay in europe (but even in the states) but still affordable.We sat at the bar just in front of the ovens and could see the preparation of many different pizzas (and other dishes).All seemed yummi!Must visit ..
4
We really enjoyed the apps, pizzas and desserts. Seems to be the same quality and creativity as the mother ship in Los Angelos. However, the service was decidedly sub-par. Unlike LA, they didn't have a quality focus. We had trouble getting any server's attention, throughout the meal. Absolutely no personal touch.
3
Considering the restaurant is in a prime location at MBS, their service and food is really awful. So unless you want just pizzas, definitely give the restaurant a skip!We took a friend out on her birthday on a Monday afternoon. We ordered two rucola salads, which was presented in such an unappealing fashion! And it had just some rocket leaves with 2-3 pieces of shaved cheese and 2-3 slices of mushroom with an overtone of lemon garlic dressing. We ordered three pizzas. They were with mushrooms, with buratta cheese and with olives. They were thin crust and were good! But I cannot make a meal with just pizza. I need a nice salad and a nice dessert to go along with this kind of meal!I asked for their pasta of the day. And once again came a bowl of disgusting looking cheesiest lasagne I've seen. We had a bit of it and left the whole dish. Since it was our friends bday, we requested for their best dessert. They got out this banana dessert that was awful! And even charged us for it!No one bothered to ask us why there was untouched food on the table or serve with a smile. Cold service! Would dread going back to this place. Cost us $200 for 5 of us for 2 salads, 3 pizzas, 1 lasagne and 1 banana dessert!

You'll find this pizzeria in the glitzy Marina Bay Sands mall so not surprisingly it's the kind of place that tries hard to be cool... with prices to match. Having said that, my Napoletana pizza was pretty good. It was thin and crispy in the middle with a thicker doughy crust around the outside. The olives, capers, anchovies and sun-blushed tomatoes that made up the toppings were good quality meaning it wasn't overly salty as can be the case with lesser versions of the same pizza. But despite the fact that it was a good pizza I'm still only giving them 3 stars as service was confusing & erratic and the price of S$55 including tax & service for one pizza & one 500ml bottle of local beer is just too high. Nice but not worth the price
4
Went here to try their pizza's and wasnt disappointed. Good size, perfectly baked, what needs to be on is there. Prices are big high but thats more because of the area you are visiting. Staff was accurate, didnt have to wait long for my food. Just found it bit weird when they know their creditcard reader isnt working properly that they kept trying to pull the card trough the reader...but so far no complaints.
4
Best pizza ever.... The crust is amazing.... Baked to perfection.. I highly recommend place. Very attentive and friendly staff....
1
The pizza is terrible. Not italian at all, the dough was thick and undercooked like a Pizza Hut look a like. The tomate sauce was awfull as well without any italian taste, almost an asian pizza.
The service took forever and the price was high.
3
We had lunch in Pizzeria Mozza and it was good.
The staff was gentle and the ambience was chic.
The pizza was good but not excellent. The prices were high.
4
Good (not great) service with magnificent pizza. Breakfast lunch and evening meal. Anytime is good. Highly recommended.
4
Decided to pop by here for a quick lunch. This is the pizza/casual arm of the Mozza empire. Next door is the more high end Osteria Mozza which only opens for dinnerOrdered a pizza as they're famous for that. Not sure why there are complaints about it. My pizza was fine - thin crust and deliciousAs I was alone, that's all I could eat. otherwise come with more friends and order a range of food, that may be bette
5
We ordered the Funghi Misti pizza and the Spinach Ricotta Salata for early dinner (around 5 p.m.). Both are really really good. However, the berry-flavored fizzy drink I ordered was not even close to being at par with the food. Service was great and the staff are friendly. A bit expensive but that's quite expected given the location and the chef associated with the place
2
This place has nothing to do with real Italian pizza or any high quality pizza for that matter. Low quality pizza base, quite poor quality sauce (tomato sauce was overly sweet for some reason). Of course I understand we pay for the location Marina Bay Sands and all that but if you guys call yourself a pizzeria how about learning to make high quality pizza? They do have nice owen and this is what made us want to try their pizza. Total disappointment. :( Don't go there for pizza! I don't know about other menu items but they should be ashamed to promote themselves as pizzeria. (On the bright side it is actually possible to find good quality pizza in Singapore, so pizza lover don't need to despair)
5
On B1 level great place. we went on a Monday the place was jumping. Lighting romantic with candles on table. Wine reasonable price. Service great and attentive. We had an hour wait for our table but if you give your UK mobile number they will ring you if an earlier opportunity arises- which it did for us.Pizzas lovely and authentic. Dessert was butterscotch something and was fantastic. Will go back. Top Tip : if waiting for a table, crack on down to rasapura Masters and have a couple of beers
5
The salads are fantastic and one has to have the pizza. The berry tart is also Super and I highly recommend Mozza for pizza lovers. You can't get better pizza in Singapore :)I suggest booking in advance so that you're not disappointed as it tends to get busy. The bruschetta is also great
5
We sat at the bar in front of the open kitchen, it was quite interesting watching the busy kitchen and show our kid how our food were made using the firewood oven. The pizza is very nice with the best crust. We also ordered mussles and calamari for antipasta. both grilled perfectly. service is good but I observed that it is our luck cus some of them didnt look so friendly. And do book in advanced or avoid meal time when u go
3
We had two pizzas and 1 soft drink and 1 orange juice take away and cost about $80. The pizza was nice but I think the for the price I have had a lot better and larger meals in the past
5
In a city stuffed with food options it isn't easy to stand out. This gem though is the best pizza to be had...not cheap and very popular so you need to book
4
We had lunch here on our way to see the gardens by the bay. The menu was great with different salads and pizzas. The staff looked after us and were very attentive throughout the meal. 2 meals with drinks (no starters or desserts) S$56
5
Everything perfect. The staff very friendly. Pizza with mushrooms was the best I have ever tried, I assume all pizza here is amazing. Absolutely recommended.
4
Typical Singapore prices given this is within the Marina Bay Sands complex.Managed to get a table for five without waiting - we were lucky - and really impressed with the service (how the waitress remembered our order I will never know!). Food portions were good and very tasty.Would return if in Singapore and fancied a Pizza in this type of environment
4
After the conference in Marina Bay, we decided to eat at Pizzeria Mozza because of good reviews. We didn't reserve table since we thought only the adjacent restaurant will be full. however, at 6PM the only available space was at the bar. We decided to give in and it did not disappoint. The pizzas were great and the service was impeccable. Make sure to try meatballs as appetizer and pizza with potatoes and eggs. Price was kinda steep though
3
We were greeting by 2 very rude ladies as soon as we walked in. Even though we booked they tried to put us on the high table. The menu is small and not great. The pizzas are "fancy" and don't taste great. Very over-priced also. You won't miss out if you don't go here
4
I went to Mozza for dinner with colleagues and we had the private room with a pre-ordered set menu.We had arancini in tomato sauce, mussels with bread & a cheesy sauce and puy lentils with cheese, followed by a salad. Mains were 3 different types of pizzas. And dessert was cannoli with ricotta cheese and coffee pudding with salted caramel sauce. Highlights for me were the mussels with the cheese sauce, tomato and mozzarella pizza and cannoli. Food was overall quite good and the staff is attentive and helpful
4
We had a salad and two pizze with my wife on a Sunday evening. Really good italian pizza, nice (quite simple) salad, a glass of prosecco, a very nice dessert and a glass of sangue di giuda. The staff was very friendly and professional. As it's supposed to be. So it would've been a great restaurant experience if this all would've been around SGD 80. Unfortunately it was SGD 185.Especially disturbing that a glass of sangue di giuda was SGD 23, while a bottle costs around that, in an ordinary wine shop.I know, this is Singapore, the Shoppes, Mario Batali and all... but still... outrageous pricing for a pizzeria
5
My third time in Singapore and Mozzarella will always be in the itinerary.It is really expensive but the ingredients that they use is the freshest you will find and their crust is something that cannot be imitated by other pizzerias. I ordered the Burrata Pizza. The Burrata had a milkier/creamier taste that the other burratas I've tasted. Good for snacks. Will be coming back every time
3
Last year we had a very enjoyable lunch at Pizzeria Mozza. We planned to visit Singapore again,and therefore I made an on-line reservation, and was so existed about our lunch. Maybe I was over existed, but our lunch was not as terrific as last time. I wanted to repeat some the same orders, and ordered Olives al forno, Burrata and Margherita pizza. The olives were delicious, as the last time. Fried potatoes with sage & rosemary did not impressed us. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same about the pizza. The crust had an overcooked/burned ends but the center was too mushy. The Burrata cheese was cold. The Margherita pizza also had the “wet” center. We have decided to skip the dessert. We liked our visit but probably will try a different place next time
4
Great food, good service and very homey yet classy atmosphere in a very central location in Singapore.The menu is varied but don't expect pastas to be included - the focus is mains, pizza and antipasti.We ordered the calamari al forno, citrus avocado, burata pizza and prosciutto pizza - and we loved every single thing we ordered. Must visit when in singapore
4
We ate in osteria mozza and when we realised the pizzeria mozza was under the same group we wanted to try their pizza by the time that osteria mozza was very good. The pizza was perfect and we were lucky these restaurants were close to our hotel.
1
I don't normally give reviews but felt compelled to do so after the unreasonable attitude of the manager. We booked a table for 5, a month before coming down. When we arrived, we were shocked to be given a table for 4, with 3 people squeezed at one side of the table. When we moved one seat to the edge of the table, the manager insisted that we move the seat back. She also insisted that it was a table for 5, just that it would be "a little cramped". When we asked to move to a bigger table, she said that the restaurant was fully booked, and not something she could do.The point is that, having booked the table a month before hand, we should have been allocated a proper table for 5 and not be squeezed into a table for 4, just so that they could maximise their seats. This experience marred what would otherwise have been a decent meal
4
Mozza has two separate kitchens serving pizza and pasta. Make your request known during your reservation. By 6.30 Mozza's loyal patrons just stream in happily along with the Italian songs as if every Italian grandma are preparing the meals in a Italian festival!The thin crusted pizza with its light thinly spread tomato base and cheese topped deliciously with the meatballs, salami, sausages entice you to crave for another bite. Savouring it with the Italian beer gives you great satisfaction of a complete Italian meal.Appetisers of pig's ear deep fried in a batter can be added as a side dish.A roasted chicken thigh with vinegared greens with red roasted pepper complement the meal well. We ended the birthday celebration well with a complementary ice cream from Mozza.The bustling and happy atmosphere is reminiscent of my Italian holiday where we were brought through the narrow streets of Italy to a cool cellared restaurant that served very good Italian appetisers, pizza and pasta to our great delight with smiling service
3
This is in an expensive shopping mall right on the marina. Pizzas were good but not worth the extra money. Drinks very expensive. Staff were overly attentive- clearly trying to rush you along. Wouldn't visit again but ok if you need to eat in this expensive part of town
4
It was so busy in Mozza when we walked past we had to give it a go.They have a very Italian menu, and woodfire pizza is on the list! The bases are very thin and crunchy at the edge with nice flavors. It is expensive compaired to Australia, cheapest pizza is $24sd ranging up to around $34sd.Nice dim lighting and very busy.
4
We went their last week with friends of mine for dinner... the food was excellent and the service, ensure that you make a reservation as the restaurant was pack cause its in the shopping center. The restaurant is a bit to pricey but overall was perfect
5
It was a very busy Saturday night but the service our amazing waitress Ferrari was exceptional. She was very friendly, knowledgeable and charming. She explained the menu beautifully and when drinks did not arrive as expected, she did not hesitate to follow this up promptly.The food was absolutely delicious. I had the lamb stracotto (Saturdays dinner special) and my partner had a pizza, both were outstanding. The highlight for me was the caramel copetta for dessert, completely indulgent and 100% delicious.I would not hesitate to return if we were lucky enough to travel to Singapore again, and I would love to have Ferrari as our waitress again, she made our evening even more memorable
4
My brother and I went to the Mozza restaurants intending to use a deal we had gotten from the MBS to eat at Osteria Mozza. After discovering that the deal was not valid for that day we decided to go here for a delicious but cheaper meal. The meal of 2 pizzas, 2 appetizers, and 2 glasses of wine ended up costing us over $200 USD. It was a delicious meal, but not that delicious... Buyer beware
4
Great place to come to spend a night out with friends.The ingredients are of a high quality but you will pay for the pleasure. Good service staff. Be sure to make sure you reserve a table otherwise you'll spend a long time queuing.
1
Greeted the receptionist and requested for a table of 4. The Caucasian receptionist just stare blankly and reply rudely that table available at 3! Absolutely snot service!
4
Service was fine, and wine was ok. The antipasti we had were crispy and nice. Pizza with parma ham was excellent! Little expensive.
5
Do your reservation in advance or expect hours of queue!! Great service, attentive and polite staffs. Pizza was phenomenon with thin pastry, good quality toppings, and generous in size!!!
4
Thin pastry, fresh quality toppings, cooked to perfection, good price excellent matching beverage list.
Some times a wait, but tables turn over quickly. Good simple service.
4
I stayed in Singapore for a weekend, as I am always on business trip , I choose places located next to the hotel I am staying and this was the case of Pizzeria Mozza.Conveniently located and with a cosy atmosphere , it made me feel like in a Trattoria since the moment I walked in.We ordered Pizza and some starters, everything was delicious and better than expected.The price is also worthy , we will come again in our next trip!
5
I've been to this place a couple of times before, but never got around to reviewing it. We went there last night for an early dinner before the SG50 fireworks began. We were just looking for a good, light meal and were pleasantly surprised and reminded of how good the food there is.We had the roasted beets, bufala & horseradish and the Asparagus al fornowith prosciutto & parmigiano for apis, and the burrata and prosciutto pizzas, just right for 3 persons. The pizzas are thin crust and light, but very delicious, as were the starters. The prosciutto di parma pizza comes with rucola, tomato & mozzarella, and the burrata one came with slow roasted tomatoes & Sicilian oregano. Getting hungry just recalling them!We had a nice Italian sauvignon blanc to go with the meal, and ended with 3 flavors of sorbet/gelato. The sorbet was a dark chocolate rum creation, and the two gelatos were olive oil and espresso. All were excellent - a perfect ending to a perfect meal.One of my favorites in Singapore now
5
We're here at least twice a month; the roasted beets appetizer isn't to be missed, or the pitchers of basil mint iced tea. The pizzas never disappoint (you'll need to find your favorite), and the staff is among the most consistently professional my wife and I have encountered in Singapore.Others complain about the price, but compared to similar restaurants in Singapore, Mozza delivers great value. We live in town and spent far too much money at other restaurants with high prices, bad service and lousy food before stumbling across Mozza. One tip: Don't be put off by the queue if you don't have a reservation. Seats at the bar overlooking the food prep stations are first come-first, first-served and turn over quickly. They are among our favorite places to eat in the restaurant, akin to "chef seats" at other restaurants
5
I'm passionate about authentic tasty pizza. Although it's expensive, it's one of the best pizza's I've had anywhere. Tasty!!! Seriously amazing wood fired pizza. You must try. The antipasti is also really tasty! Good service as well but expect to pay $30sg a glass of wine.
5
My partner and I are a huge fan of the Mozza restaurant in Los Angeles and when we find out that Mozza opened one restaurant in Singapore we were THRILLED!! The food here are exceptionally delicious. Mozza in Singapore bring EVERYTHING that its Los Angeles HQ did right and add some Singapore hustle and bustle to its atmosphere. we started with 'Nancy's Chopped Salad' which was very californian very fresh and clean and delicious. and then add 'Chicken Liver Pate' and the 'White Bean' bruschetta. The chicken liver pate is THAT good!! I could have ordered 2!! now, their pizza!! I can't even describe how right and how good their pizza was. Delicious rich flavour, thin crust.. ugh... so good. we always go with the fennel sausage one, because we love fennel and italian sausage and bacon.. Whenever I'm in LA or Singapore it feels like visiting an old relative's house and being serve delicious food
3
The best was actually the antipasti. The pizza was good also But as the pricing is five-stars, so we should expect more. Busy place. had to order the day before.
5
We are huge Mozza fans from the LA restaraunts and were concerned that the pizza could not be replicated in Singapore. Well we were wrong. The pizza toppings were even better and that crust! The couple next to us had two each. Respect! We managed two between my grown up son and I. We did however have a whole lot of entrees before that which were just delicious. Service was excellent for such a busy restaraunt.If you want a break from the amazing Singapore food , pizza mozza is the bomb
3
I went there on my latest visit to Singapore. I started with the meatballs. There were 3 in the order. It was a good size order. They were very flavorful and not picky at all. For my main, I had the margarita pizza. It was good but nothing exceptional. The prices were not bad for Singapore. I would be willing to go back there if I was in the area. But it is not worth the trip just to go there.
3
Came here after seeing them on The Toque 12 and thought I have to come try the pizzas. Service was good. We ordered the meat lover pizza and margherita pizza with additional Parma ham and pineapple toppings at the side. The two pizzas alone came up to $75 excluding service charge and gst, which is really expensive for pizzas. In a nutshell, overhyped, overpriced and overrated.
4
Great place for pizza and the place is always buzzing with people. I was in Singapore for a conference and went there 3 days in a row because i loved the bacon and Potato pizza so much. I went there for lunch the first time and lord behold, the Food Paparazzi! was there. It was really quite a sight. There were a dozen or so professional photographers crowded round the wood fire ovens and pizza bar taking pictures and videos of the pizza team. I joined in the spectacle and took photos of the photographers taking shots. Lol.The staff were friendly although service is not as sophisticated as one would expect from a fairly pricey establishment - my favourite pizza cost AUD $38 each. Have never paid this much for a pizza before BUT it was delicious.Their freshly made flavoured ice teas were nice too
3
The place has a good feel and service was really good with a great menu. The only downside was the price, I know Singapore can be expensive so didn't expect it to be cheap. There are two size options so you can pick to suit appetite but even so
5
The absolute best by far EVER margarita pizza I've ever eaten anywhere in the world! Would pay 10 x more then what we were charged to have this again! Glad I live in Australia otherwise I'd be fat rom eating this pizza all the time haha! So worth the trip
3
We were staying in Marina Bay Sands and saw this restaurant in the mall. We wanted to try it and went for an early dinner. Ordered Nancy's Chopped and Prosciutto Pizza plus drinks. For the price that we paid I expected better food and service. I came here specifically to try the pizza but found it nothing special. I expected something better. It was okay but not outstanding that I will want to go back again. Service was also hit or miss. Considering the number of people dining in I only saw three waiters serving the whole area so it took a while to get their attention. But there are actually 4 receptionist in front doing nothing but chit chat
3
The word for this restaurant is "inconsistent."Went there twice, within 2 days, with my son. Each time, we ordered the same thing: one pizza each, and an order of fried squash blossoms. My son had a cup of the gelato. One meal was a lunch, one was a dinner (perhaps this is the difference).At dinner, the pizzas were very good. Possibly the best I've had in Singapore. The crust was soft (and floppy) while at the same time buoyant with a fine crumb and not raw, with a nice "cornice" around it. The toppings were fresh and pleasantly balanced.At lunch, on the other hand, the crust was just hard, Singapore style. It was not crispy, it was just hard, like eating cardboard. The tomato sauce was overcooked (too concentrated) and tasted like bad American pasta sauce. It was a stunning contrast.The blossoms were well fried. They were stuffed with ricotta, which made for an interesting riff on the traditional mozzarella. They were topped with large crystals of sea salt, which provided for the saltiness added by the anchovy included with the stuffing in the traditional recipe, but without the corresponding umami. Not bad on the whole, but the anchovy would have improved them.The gelato was uninspired on the whole. The melon sorbetto very good, the vanilla and strawberry pedestrian.So, 3 stars that could easily become 4 if they were to get their pizza under some quality control and consistently deliver the better version.Mario, ci sei?

This is my favorite restaurant in the entire MBS. They have good pizzas but if you are not a pizza sort of person they have all sorts of interesting appetizers and salads which are wonderful. We can go there and eat only appetizers like tapas style. Not such a good place with children because they have pizzas with more exotic ingredients no dedicated children's menu. They can make plain pasta on request though. Always full during mealtimes during the weekends so you can only get a seat with a reservation. However its pretty empty at all other times and has a nice balcony to see the people go by down the shoppes
4
We stopped by after visiting the Flower Dome. In the huge Bay Front Mall.
Kids had their own individual Pizza, enjoyed it. Wife and me just had a meatball starter as we wanted to eat at Din Tai Fung!
Was expensive, but a good meal.
3
We were looking forward to a great pizza, but were disappointed from beginning to end. Service was lukewarm and the pizzas were quite disappointing.
4
This place is popular, and rightly so. Keen staff work to a formula with a short menu. Tasty favourites are promoted. We had a mozzarella-based pizza which was excellent. Their salads are good too. Reasonably priced in what is a chic shopping centre.
5
Yesterday we went to Prego for dinner. Today lunch is Mozza. It's better!
Good quality of pizza and nice appetizers..
Price is even cheaper than Prego.
I will definitely go back!
4
Dropped by for dinner and was quickly seated at the bar. Friendly staff and attentive, without hovering, even though the restaurant was quite busy. Great calamari appetizer, and good pizza. Prices not outrageous, especially considering the location near very high-end stores.
4
Once you get past the fact that you are eating in a mall, it's a very nice place for a meal. It's not quite up to their pizza place Otto (in NYC) but is still quite good. All the food that I've had here is excellent but a must eat is the olive oil gelato. I discovered this at Otto and have been hooked ever since
4
Decided to have a pre-show lunch here without a reservation and managed to get a table. Lucky for us! We ordered Salame Picante, Cauliflower Fritti and a couple of drinks but no time for desserts though. By far the best pizza we have tried here in SG and the cauliflower fritti was so tasty. Drinks are pricey but ambience is good. Staff are friendly and attentive. Can't wait to come back to try the rest of the pizzas
5
Been to Pizzeria Mozza for about 5 times now and all I can say is that they've done a really great job. The food never disappoints and are definitely worth the price. The meatball and chicken wing starters are amazing! We tried the funghi misti pizza, egg bacon pizza, Bianca pizza...etc just to name a few and all were superb. Really like the thin and crispy crust! Desserts are just as beautiful at Pizzeria. One will never be disappointed after trying out this amazing place
3
I took my young daughter here after a trip to the Gardens by the Bay. To tell the truth, we went because the new Bread Street Kitchen was full. Service was very pleasant and the pizzas were good enough but nothing like as good as similar places in the US. My fennel sausage was delicious and generously portioned. The shredded spring onions and red onions went well it could have done with more mozarella and so was a bit dry. My daughter had the salame piccante and they kindly put the chilis on the side. She didn't leave any. I thought about having a glass of wine but with the cheapest at S$21 per smallish glass of an uninspiring wine I thought again. Even by Singapore standards, that is pushing it too far. The restaurant filled up with mainly Japanese and Chinese tourists even on a Wednesday lunchtime
5
This Pizzeria is amazing. In the shoppes at the Marina Bay Sands, it is a bit on the pricey side but if you are craving a pizza in Singapore, this is your place. Great pizza options but if want to indulge, go for the meat pizza (spicy salami, sausage, bacon and pancetta). Make yourself feel healthier by paring it with the Insalate Miste. The setting is very relaxed and casual and the staff are very attentive. Give it a try.
4
Had a pizza and some antipasto after a day shopping.
Food was interesting, tasty and well presented.
Great with a glass of the recommended wine.
Well recommended.
3
Once we sat down, we were given complimentary herbs flat bread. It was delicious. We didn't order drinks. Had their complimentary water.I knew this was an expensive pizza place by looking at the online menu. So I was expecting either delicious pizza or portion worth of the money. We ordered pizza margherita and Prosciutto di Parma. Both pizzas came a little burnt at the crust, crunchy, thin and a little tough. Pizza size is the size of a dining plate. Flavour was not bad. The prosciutto was yummy. Both pizzas was good but not great. I've eaten better pizza that cost lesser than this. We also ordered wild mushrooms bruschette which in my opinion the flavor didn't blend well together. Fried squash blossoms with house made ricotta was great. Both antipasti was small in portion.For desserts, we ordered tiramisu and rocky road gelato pie. The tiramisu was overwhelmed with alcohol (almost like eating something else). There were no coffee flavour. Thank god the rocky road gelato pie saved the day. It was the best thing I ate here. Do order it!Overall, portion was small for the price paid, food wise there are hits and misses. Waitress that served us was attentive and always smiley. The place is jam-packed (and noisy) so reservation is needed. We went there for dinner with reservation. The place is dimly lit, not a good place for photography or even read your menu. There are washroom in the restaurant

We went to Singapore last October 2014 and definitely made a reservation in this restaurant because we heard this is from Mario Batalli's. I would say the place is great, jampacked with a lot of guests even though it was a weekday, so I would suggest to make a reservation too if you're planning to visit. The pizza was fine though. We ordered fennel sausage pizza and it wasn't really one of the best we have tasted. Maybe because we are Asians and our palates usually savor food that are bursting with flavors, we weren't really that impressed because it was quite bland and the herb flavors were too strong. But I'm pretty sure maybe other nationalities would love it. We also had their chicken wings which was good actually. Not our typical flavors but it was really good. Price is a bit expensive but it's worth it.Overall, the place is a bit dark but very cozy, good for some hangout with friends or your partner, maybe not so much with families with small kids. It is very convenient especially for tourists since it is just within the Marina Bay Sands area. I have no problem with customer service at all. All the staff are well trained and always giving out a smile. If given a chance to come back to Singapore, I would still love to visit Pizzeria Mozza again

Probably one of the best pizzas in Singapore, has a bit of pepper in the tomato sauce and the cheese sticks a bit salty, but the overall experience of the food was great, I did enjoy fresh tomatoes, nice olives, good anchovies, and a nice apple ice tea, great atmosphere, To bad that they don't have pasta dishes, 6 SGD per beverage (ice tea) and 28 SGD per pizza, if you are two order an entree and then the pizza

Went here in May 2015 to take out my father-in-law. We booked in advance which I recommend doing as I saw people being turned away or asked to come back. We shared two Pizzas, one meat and one veg and tried the potatoes and squid Bill was around SG$150 which again I think is quite fair for the location, now this is a key point in this. Location and Name. Although a celebrity restaurant, if you have ever visited a Pizza Express in the UK, you would know that this is very similar. OK - the Pizzas are slightly larger and you can tell they are fresh. But, nevertheless, its a wood fired pizza with a big name slapped on the brand. In terms of business dynamics I'm sure this is working out well for Mario, although I do feel the locals and other travellers whom this is a treat are not getting value for money. The service was mixed, waiters flying around, not dedicated waiter, not in my experience and again is very "business lunch". It would work for families but I would need to think on that. Good experience as there are only two in the world, SG and LA, so worth it if you are in the area. The front desk staff I encountered was very very helpful. If you want to do some shopping afterwards you are spoilt for choice

I have always wanted to visit one of Mario's restaurants. I was not disappointed. We shared a meatballs al forno appetizer which was three meatbals in a rustic sauce. Really good! I had the Salami Picante pizza and my business partner had the mortadella sandwich. The pizza was great having a thin crust and just enough sauce and topping to give it flavor. I do not like pizza loaded with a bunch of topping. My pizza took a little time as they were busy so the chef sent out a caprese appetizer. The mozarela was freshly made, the tomatos sweet and the basil fresh. This was the best caprese I have ever had. What I liked most was the service. Our server was charming, helpful and attetentive. The place was hopping and she new how and when to engage us while we waited for our food. This was a great experience and I will be back. Thanks Mario for living up to my expectations

For delicious homemade, baked in woodfire oven pizza, this is THE place to go. Price is slightly higher than one can expect for a pizzeria. However, its creative menu with fresh produce, plus exceptional service are justifiable to the price charged. We ordered six types of Antipasti to share; we agreed stand-out dishes were the Umbrian Lentils Olive Oil Fried Egg, Grilled Asparagus With Proschiutto and Burrata With Pesto & Tomato. The Burrata was absolutely divine which left us craved for more. We returned to the restaurant for supper after the concert and had the Burrata again! We also ordered an Egg, Bacon, Yukon Gold Potato, Cippolini & Thyme pizza to share -- definitely one of the best pizzas we've had (out of Italy). Dough was rolled to a perfect density to achieve its crispiness with slight burnt around the edges. Proportion of the toppings were well balanced, each layer of the ingredients formed a mouthful of flavours at every bite.Service was exceptional. Our food was served within 20 minutes even when it was busy. We will definitely return on our next visit to Singapore, this time to try the infamous Nancy's chopped salad

We had booked a concert at the Marina Bay Sands Theatres and were struggling to find a suitable pre-theatre dining option close by. The options available at the Marina Bay shopping area generally seem to fall into two main categories, food court and fine dining and we were looking for something in between. Finally we settled on the Pizzeria Mozza just across from the theatres and we had a very pleasant surprise.We arrived to find the place less than half full but it quickly filled. It is essential to book in advance if you want to be sure of a table in plenty of time before a show. The service was excellent and well above what we normally expect at a pizza restaurant, even a knowledgeable sommelier to help choose a wine from the all-Italian list. The pizza choices were more exotic than usual and the range of complementary dishes very tempting. All of our choices were well-prepared and well-paced for our deadline.You can very easily spend SGD100 a head or more here, which is a lot for a pizza place, but the staff would not be out of place in a fine dining restaurant and we were out in good time for our performance, feeling good. It really made our evening, so it was well worth the price
5
My favourite pizza place, I always make time to visit when I am in town. Keep in mind the place comes with a price. About $30,- for Pizza. I've tried most of them and never been disappointed. Get a pizza to share with a side order of nancy's chopped salad. If you love watching the process, get a seat at the bar. The staff is very friendly and service is pretty good. One thing to note, always get a reservation. The place is full for lunch and dinner
2
This restaurant was too expensive, service was super slow, and the food was mediocre. I sat at the bar with four friends and we ordered 3 pizzas to share. Our pizzas took over an hour to get and was slightly undercooked. Also it took another 15mins to get our bill. Stick to the food market in the shoppes.
4
Look it isn't cheap with $30 pizzas but they are so lovely with kids and the food is excellent quality with a great selection of affordable wines.
Convenient to Marina Bay Sands
3
pizza small and expensive,too sweet tomato
slow service.
appetizer of ham and buffalo mozzarella is good but mozzarella very small.
for this food ,expensive bill
4
Is my Wife and Daughter b'day and my daughter loves margarita pizza, be adventurous they have at least 20 varieties to choose from, so must try if you at MBS.
4
Overall great place.was a little pricey for a small sized pizza.Very friendly staff.And you should definitely try the lentil and fried goat cheese appetizer!
4
It's a big group of us for birthday celebration and they managed to arranged a private room.
The wait staffs are attentive and helpful. The food are fresh, so fresh and delicious!
All in all, they provided an amazing evening the birthday boy and us.
4
Really good pizza - a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. Not a particularly great location as it is in the middle of a shopping mall. But great service and great food!
5
On my own on a business trip, no tables left, but the staff suggested sitting at a bar adjacent to the show kitchen. This was actually the best seat in the house as I could see how the chefs worked, how they constructed the meals and orchestrated the work between them. Despite being very busy, the service was attentive and curious. Drinks came quickly, along with lovely flatbreads on the house. Seeing me sitting on my own, a waitress came over and suggested some books to read!, and brought over a book by the restaurant owner. The book was interesting, but I loved seeing the show kitchen at work. My pizza tasted amazing and had the restaurants' own home-made fennel sausage. I left very happy with the food, entertainment and service. Highly recommended if you are in the Marina Bay area
4
Pizzas were very good but not that big. We were in four and had 2 starters and 3 pizzas. Starters were just ok, nothing special. No draft beer which is a must for a pizza joint.Ambiance was nice and service ok.On the negative side, prices were on the high side. Pizza's were anywhere from 30-40 SGD, and again, these were fairly small, individual pizzas. Beers were 17-20 SGD. I guess you are partly paying to be in the marina bay sands
4
I visited on a crowded sunday afternoon, which is a shame because it was so noisy with families and staff couldnt cope with the crowd. The experience was marred by poor service even at the entrance. What happened to serving with a smile to make visitors feel welcome? The pizzas though, were warm with fresh ingredients. No complaints about the food. Hope to visit again on a less crowded day
4
We went here for dinner after catching the Beauty and the beast show. Prior reservation is a must. Place is always full. Since 2 of us were vegetarian we ordered the Margherita and Bianca pizzas. Veg eaters take my advice and skip the Margherita pizza, the Bianca was superb
5
Dropped in for dinner with no booking – the place was packed. They got us seats at the counter overlooking the pizza making area, and I highly recommend this location.
Food was great, service fantastic and good selection of wines at reasonable (Singapore reasonable) prices.
5
Very good food here - good small plates and very good Italian style pizza. Only downside is that it is located in a shopping centre - so atmosphere a bit dull. Will be back though.
4
This was a casual and easy place for my work colleagues (and a spouse) to catch up. Lively, good service and tasty pizza with a good selection that all appreciated. Even the person who preferred salad over pizza. Would recommend this place for others wanting a casual, comfortable and lively place with friends and colleagues
4
Delicious Pizzas - handcrafted, wood fired, high quality ingredients, overall mouth watering food. If you get a chance, i would highly recommend sitting by the kitchen counter - which is where all the action is and its undeniably the best seat in the house! Chefs work in perfect harmony without a word being exchanged, executing perfect pizzas one after another! Pricey - yes! Is it worth it - definitely!! Great service with even better bellini's to match!! :
4
Had lunch on Good Friday 2015 with the family. We didn't book ahead and walked in at about 1pm. Place was bursting - we could only get a table at 2.30pm. So we made a reservation and wandered around the mall to kill time.Got back just after 2pm and got seated shortly after. The place was still pretty full - very lively.We ordered a couple of starters - roasted beet salad with burrata and cauliflower fritti. The beets were cold (I would have preferred it hot) but the burrata was excellent. It's house made and is one of their specialties. Do NOT miss it. The cauliflower was fried very well - all perfectly crispy We also had 2 pizza's - the classic margarita and the tomato & burrata. Both pizza's were so good - the crust is nice and crispy. The thicker edges have the same crispiness outside but slightly chewy on the inside. I usually discard the thicker crusts but this got polished down in no time. And I don't need to rave about the burrata again....sooo good.Had a few glasses of wine while my wife had a bellini. Very enjoyable lunch. Also tried their caramel copatta with marshmallow sauce & salted peanuts desert. While it was nice it was just way too sweet. I guess some may like it but we wished the sugar had been tempered down a little and it would go nicely with the salted peanuts.The service was good and the staff were very attentive. The entire meal came up to a little over SGD200. I guess the location (Marina Sand's Shoppe) and the celebrity status of Mario Batali accounted for the premium price but the pizza was worth it.Will return to try out the other pizza's - hopefully with a bigger group so we can try more of the their dishes.They have a fine dining restaurant next door as well - Osteria. Will have to try that as well in our next visit

My husband and I had had a wonderful meal a previous evening at the partner restaurant Ozzeria Mozza, so decided to try the pizza place next door to it. There's no denying that the pizza and salad were very good - excellent ingredients were used and it was very tasty. Now for the negatives - the restaurant is very gloomy which makes it hard to read the menu and difficult to appreciate the colours of the food (you eat with your eyes as well after all). Even the staff seemed to have difficulty checking through the bill because they couldn't see. Worse than this was the free water. We had enjoyed the complimentary water from the Ozzeria next door and thought that this would be the same in the pizza restaurant - unfortunately they just provided tap water (which is meant to be drinkable, but has an off-putting taste). My husband and I thought that this was shameful, especially as you pay top price for the pizza and salad. I think a restaurant like this should provide proper distilled water that doesn't spoil the taste of the food. We asked our waitress to take our water away as we didn't like the taste, and she just removed it without saying anything. Strange that the two restaurants could have such different tasting complimentary water
3
Jet lagged and looking for a quick and easy solution, we rolled into the Mall attached to the Marina Bay Sands. Average and overpriced (3 pizzas, one shared starter and 3 soft drinks Â£100). There is much better just a short (and cheap) taxi ride away
5
Highly recommended! I was very surprised as normally avoid the mall/hotel type restaurants but we have been impressed with several of the MBS restaurants! The pizza here is excellent ...we had a few other sharing dishes and a good bottle of red ....with a very reasonable bill! The only let down is nothing to do with the restaurant but the parents who bring children in and then let them proceed to play their hand held games at a noise level above the music. Gone have the days of quality family conversation over meals.The staff must be used to it as we asked to be moved once and they were very prompt and efficient even though the place was busy.If not with kids suggest avoiding afternoon dining ....but a must try for casual high quality good value meal
2
We went on a Tuesday evening and it was very quiet with no atmosphere. I was pleased by the addition of water on the table but it was warm and tasted as if it had come straight from the bay. The service was pretty terrible - we were largely ignored all evening. The pizza wasn't great either. It was very greasy but we had waited ages so I was hungry and ate it all. Afraid I cannot recommend
4
Finally had the chance to dine here. Good food, wife really enjoyed the pizza. Staff was attentive enough and caring for. Saw wife and I having difficult time having our dinner being disturbed by the kids, she took both kids to sit on the counter table explaining how the wood-fired oven work. Just enough 10 mins to engulf my first slice of pizza and appetizer. Great dessert to finish off the evening. All tummies were satisfied
5
One of the best places in Singapore for pizza. Great selection of Italian red wines! It gets busy, I would recommend to book.
5
Superb, superb, superb. Amazing Pizzas, great ambience. Just loved it. The thin crust, the sauce, everything was great.
5
Rustic meets fine dining in this high end pizza place, highly recommended. Try the calamari appetiser which is baked with chickpeas in the pizza oven, not crumbed or fried.
4
Even before 7 pm, the place was already buzzing and it gave a nice atmosphere in upmarket pizzeria setting. Food was fast and very good in both selection and taste. The service was efficient like what it should be for pizzeria.
3
The location doesn't inspire confidence (it's in a shopping mall after all), but actually the atmosphere isn't too bad. The food is pretty good too - a good menu and great pizza bases and toppings. However, the service is pretty slow and surly and the chef certainly doesn't like his artistic license fettered. We went with our two young kids. The restaurant is kid friendly in that it has high chairs, but it stops there. There is no kids menu. Given the size of the pizzas, we thought it would be best for our 3 and 5 year olds to share one between them. But one doesn't like pineapple and the other does. So we asked for them to put the pineapple on just half. From the reaction, you would have thought we had asked for diamonds to be encrusted into it. Apparently asking the chef to sprinkle pineapple in a linear rather than circular motion ( i.e. over half rather than the whole) was a step too far and absolutely not something that can be done in a celebrity restaurant. It went to manager level but still came back with a resounding cannot la. The customer is very much second place to the checkbox it appears. A shame - I may have gone back otherwise
4
I went for dinner with a Friend... Ambiance was nice a bit crowded but we got a seat at the corner thanks to a friendly staff who serve us but unfortunately we didn't get the name anyways we got a antipasti artichoke with ricotta and some awesome meat lover pizza sure come back again
4
Knowing that this is one of Chef Mario Batali's restaurants, we wanted to try it out. The place is usually packed so a reservation is a must. The pizza is superb! The thin crust is very similar to the pizzerias of Rome so this is as close as you can get to authentic Italian pizza! Even if the place is packed you don't feel rushed by the staff as they are very friendly and accommodating.When I moved my reservation to a later time, the receptionist politely said, no problem
5
We sat at the bar and watched our pizzas being made - a great piece of food theatre. The pizzas were delicious too - thin crust, good quality ingredients, delivered to your plate within seconds of leaving the oven. Decent house wine and good service. And not too wildly expensive for the Marina Bay Sands location
5
My wife and I chose to have dinner here as were attending a concert at the MBS Theatre.It is not our first time at this restaurant,m but its about time that I wrote a review :-)First off, this is a Pizzeria, however the service and quality of pizza far surpasses any of the other pizza restaurants I have eaten at in Singapore, and probably Asia.On arrival, you are greeted politely and asked if you are attending the show. Upon replying yes, you are shown to your table, and the service staff take over. It would appear that the tables with patrons attending the shows are flagged to staff, so that the service is delivered to ensure that you enjoy your dinner, but do not feel rushed as the service is "just right", not to intrusive, but should you need something, the waiting staff always seem to appear.The beer is served chilled, to just the right temperature, extremely refreshing after a days work.Your order is taken shortly afterwards (if not at the same time, if you know what you wish to order).All pizzas are made fresh in open wood fired ovens, and arrive at your table piping hot. Quality ingredients are used in all the food prepared and you can really taste the fresh food.Bearing in mind the location, and the fresh ingredients, this is not a cheap "fast food" pizza joint, so expect to pay more that the pizza chains, but you really can taste the difference.Nothing more to say other than if you are in the area, drop in and see if they have a table, or maybe some bar seats available and enjoy some of the best pizzas in Singapore. I personally recommend the Egg, Bacon, Yukon gold potato, cippolini & thyme pizza, its Breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one meal! We'll be back
4
This place has got some really authentic italian pizzas that you can find in Singapore. I visited this place with a couple of friends in Feb and had a seat at the bar. They have got a nice collection of beers in this place, a bit pricey though, but its alright as the location is great too. I liked the gourmet pizzas that these guys prepare. Bon Apetit
4
We ended up there by coincidence but did not regret it. Great friendly service, real wood oven, nice beer! I recommend to eat at the bar, watching the pizzaiolo mastering his art.
5
OMG - Yummiest Pizzas and Salads etc Fresh Ingredients - True Wood Oven and FANTASTIC SERVICE!! I would Recommend EVERYONE on this PLANET to DINE HERE!! Put it on your Bucket List!!
5
The best pizza i ever had. Cool place, alittle bit expensive, but well worth it. disliked? NOTHING :)
4
Nice ambiance, lots of diners which is always a good sign. Lovely ultra thin pizza. Some nice interesting fresh drinks. I had grapefruit with thyme which was good
4
We had the rucolo salad, the lamb special for Saturday lunch and two pizza - their version "hawaiian"pizza and Speck. The crust was well done. The tomato sauce was tomato sweet and fresh tasting. Great for casual dining before the theater show.
5
Inside the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Center, the Osteria and Pizzeria are next to each other. I never made it to the Osteria because I couldn't stay away from the pizza! Thin crust, wood fired, interesting combos and fresh toppings, all baked to perfection. The salads and appetizers also are great. The drinks are good and so are the wines. Really, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. The service is fast and efficient and, thankfully, they don't tell you their name and expect to be friends
4
Here you can eat a real Italian pizza. This restaurant is inside the shopping next to the hotel Marina Bay Sands. You can reach the shopping from the hotel lobby. It is a good option to those who are guests of the hotel and want to eat in a casual but elegant place
5
We try the osteria and the pizzeria in different days (you have to choose one before enter) and the food in both restaurant are super good.Pizza are homemade, with a good wine list and delicious starters. Good atmosphere.Osteria's pasta is one of the best pasta I eat, very delicious. Friendly staff.The main problem is that both restaurants are inside the Marina mall (plenty of arrogant shops)You must book before
4
Came here because it's a Mario Batali place. In a shopping mall so hard to have much ambience, but it's got a good buzz about it. Service was very efficient and friendly. Having had a drink in the bar at Osteria Mozza next door first, we were pleased to see a much more affordable wine list in the Pizzeria and had a lovely bottle of Chianti. Ordered a few of the antipasto/ starter dishes which were all excellent and then we shared a couple of pizzas. If you like a good thin crust pizza then you will love these ones - perfect! Great variety of toppings including some interesting options like Brussel sprouts!Good gelato and excellent coffee too!All in all we had a great night and would love to go back next time we are in Singapore
5
As good as the worlds best pizza Tony's in San Francisco, we loved our pizza experience. Incredibly fresh ingredients and very crunchy bases. Loved the fungi and prosciutto varieties. The gelato is to die for - the best blood orange sorbet you will ever taste. Tiramisu too much chocolate sprinkled on top. Must book to get dining time preference. Service ok. Pizza lovers to Singapore must dine here - unforgettable
5
Love this place
Had pizza from celebrity chef Mario batolli in NYC but the fresh produce and base they use in this extension of his resturants is out of this world
Fantastic
We love it
Mushroom is the best
3
I didn't think the flavors on the pizzas blended very well. The wine list went from modest to very expensive - mostly the latter. We had a private room for a business dinner that was very nice for 20+. Had to do a fixed price menu, but had lots of choices
4
An easy Sunday Lunch in this famous chain at The Marina shopping mall with friends . The food is very well presented And very well prepared but is Also very standard and ordinary .The concept is nice and is quite unique. There is no pasta dishes but in sunday The special is The lasagna which i not try .We taste a couple of pizzas with very original toppings but as an italian is not a standard one which in My case i like it for a change . The concept of small dishes such as The Black lentils and fried goat cheese Was very pleasant.The wine list is good and very well done with few wines by The glass . The prices in general for food and wines are not out of market consider where are you dine .If you are visiting Singapore and you are in The Marina shopping mall make sure you make a reservation because is always Busy . Overall is a good experience and is reccomend if you want to try a concept of modern and fresh international food with and italian twist. This is not a typical italian restaurant in The world is a concept of modern italian food . Next door is The fine italian dining osteria mozza highly reccomend if you are looking for top service and fine food 
5
Cannot stop raving about the squash blossom and burata pizza! I was able to get this pizzete size item in the full pizza size. And thank goodness, the small size would never have been enough!! Great menu overall, and wine list. Great service as well, a great choice when you need a break from shopping
5
Love this place!! Going back for second time today Pizza was amazing Its not a fine dining experience, but the food and ingredients are fresh and delicious. Everyone has a specific job in the food prep (we were at the counter and watched the whole experience) I have to say, it's very interesting to watch and even better to eat. I'm a pizza lover and the crust and ingredients and result were grea
5
Best pizza ever! And I've been to Italy at that! We ordered 4 different pizzas (Prosciutto, Mushroom, Italian sausage and potato) and they all tasted wonderful! My favorite was the Italian sausage. The crusts were so good too!!! The pizzas are simply bursting with umami flavors. Can't wait to go back. Yum! Yum! Yum
1
Terrible pizza is not italian , and the dough is oily, down and not cooked. Tomato tastes like ketchup. The chef don't know how to mix the dough correctly. Because a good chef knows how to do all types of dough and mix perfectly flour water and oil and cooked well. The people think is easy make and mix a pizza but is very difficult because need many experience in mixing and work dough and cooking the pizza
5
I've been to this restaurant countless times and it's my favourite place to go for birthday lunch/dinner or just any other gathering with close friends. Their service is amazing and the food is awesome. My favourite is definitely their 'Cauliflower Fritti', 'Nancy's Chopped Salad' and the 'Leek, Fennel, Goat cheese and Bacon pizza'! For those who are staying at MBS, do give this restaurant a try to complete the experience
5
The pizza was excellent, although maybe a bit too much tomato taste. Very generous fillings and good quality ingredients. The garlic bread was the best I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a lot of garlic breads. I also must recommend the raspberry mojito which was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. It is expensive though, but worth it if you can afford it
4
This is located in the shopping mall connected to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. It is hard to find a moderate to low priced option for a casual supper. We were lucky enough to get a reservation at Mozza's. There were several unusual selections. Our pizza was very good. With wine and beer the bill was $200 for five
5
This is a great pizza restaurant, offering a range of modern and sometimes unusual pizzas and salads. Thin crispy bases topped with a range of toppings. Also a good wine list to accompany, best to make a booking as it is popular with the locals.
4
Casual and friendly with prices to match. If you are in the area, a great place for a quick bit! Been there a few times and have returned!
5
We loved the pizzas here! If you like pizza, come here!! Guarantee you will have a good time.
Great service.
A glass of moscato is $23++
4
Nice decor, great seating, delicious food. The restaurant in not your conventional pizzeria. Go for the burrata pizza.
5
great food came with a price but it's really worth for money.... too bad they don't have pasta.... great italian restaurant
5
The restaurant is located inside the marina sands complex where the shops are and do not open until 12 pm unlike the others. We tried their pizza, pork ribs, and dessert and everything was better than expected. The pizza crust was crisp and the flavors were simple yet balanced. The ribs were succulent and not too salty. Last but not the least, the desserts are also good.. I recommend the butterscotch pudding. Can't wait to go back.. I'll surely miss their pizza. Must try if you are in singapore Yum!
4
We walked into this very busy restaurant and got seated at the bar which we really enjoyed! Our batman was very friendly and made fabulous iced teas for the kids as well as Yummo cocktails for us! Watching the pizza dough dude do his thing was awesome
3
This is a Mario Batali restaurant so expectations were high. We ordered the meatballs and two pizzas. None of the items really stood out as exceptional. My favorite food was the pizza crust. The setting is nice and the service is good. A good choice if you're there already and want pizza, but not a destination restaurant
2
This restaurant has it all, but...Nice decor.Good wineVery nice asparagus with prosciutto.But the pizza.. well, it's cooked well. Nice cheese, but the tomato sauce tasted like something out of a can. And not a good can.You can't have celebrity chefs, Nancy Silverton, Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, charging those prices and serving that pizza with sauce like that. That's just a rip-off, and that's why I am scoring this restaurant so low, even thought other parts of the meal were very good. A pizza place with tomato sauce on their pizza like that deserves low scores
4
I was at Mozza Pizzeria for lunch towards the end of the lunch hours. My bruschetta with chicken liver was excellent. The pizza was the best that I have had in Asia. I ordered the Pizza Margeritha, as this despite it's simplicity is one of the hardest to get right. For many other pizzas the restaurant can "hide" behind fancy toppings. Excellent! As good as in Naples Italy. Superb crust. Rich and tasty tomato sauce. Good mozzarella and fresh basil leaves. But the service! Everybody was nice but not friendly, didn't seek eye contact and didn't smile. I was in the restaurant for approximately 45 minutes and six waiters/waitresses were involved in my simple meal. It was close to impossible to get a second glass of water. I had to ask for this three times and finally the barman took pity on me and served me some water. It shouldn't be like this and especially not considering the price level. And this was towards the end of the lunch service and there was no shortage of staff
5
When we arrived to the restaurant and we saw two big pizza oven, we realized that we would eat a good pizza in Singapore. We were correct. The pizza was perfect as well as the service. The price is very good too. We recomend it.
5
It is a super nice and crowed place.. the pizza it is delicious and reminded me of Italy... It is necessary make a reservation, otherwise you will be at the line waiting for a really long time heehehh
4
We were surprised by the attentive service, choice of beverages and excellent pizza offerings. Truly a welcome break from ordinary mall fare.
5
Being Italian I must admit that I found their pizza very good with high quality ingredients... the environment is also very nice and the service overall was excellent!
5
The menu at Mozza serves the best specialty pizza I've experienced in Asia. Excellent favors, excellent service and an extensive wine selection. Try the Fennel Sausage pizza. It's flavorable and crispy. As an appetizer try the squash blossom. A pleasant surprise. The desserts are excellent. We were a family of five and ordered key lime, rocky road and gelato and all were so good! The service was not as good as our previous visits. Our waiter took our order and disappeared. Fortunately a waitress begin to watch our table and service improved. But don't expect good service, if you have patience, the wait is worth excellent food. Make reservations to ensure a table

Arrived late without a booking but were able to sit at the bar. The waiter that served us was knowledgeable about the wine and food and his recommendations were good. Really enjoyed the food. Only disappointing element was that there must have been a change of shift/staff. So our waiter disappeared and we were left "hanging around" for a while until someone else came to serve u

Partner and I went for lunch during a non-busy time of day in late afternoon. One of us has a dietary restriction (vegetarian). We wanted to split one pizza and simply leave the meat item off of half and were willing to pay full price. We explained this initially and the server told us it would be no problem to either leave it off half or bring it on the side. It took the server 20 minutes to bring out fried cheese crisps and get the drink order, another 20 minutes to take our food order, and another 30 min before he came back and rudely said, "It's called a pepperoni pizza because it has pepperoni on it." We felt like they were pressuring us to force an upsell and did not honor their own word. We were shocked that they hadn't even begun to prepare our food after we been waiting for over an hour and were the only people there. We also never got the water water we ordered. At this point we just got frustrated and left because we were starving and thirsty. Meanwhile, we heard the manager conducting a meeting on too many bad reviews on this site so we couldn't resist adding our own warning. Stay away

Even though we found it expensive than it should be (but if you are familiar with Eataly in NYC ...), we found what we expected from a Mario Batali restaurant! Attentive service, excellent pizza offerings, high quality of ingredients, very nice service, attentive staff and nice ambience (not what you would expect in a typical mall food). But you are paying the price to be at Marina Bay Sands
5
I have never been to such restaurants and this blew me away when I had a client who brought me there.The wonderful pairings of wines to each and every dish is perfectly done and you really enjoy the great taste of the pizzas as well as the antipasto dishes.Ladies! Not forgetting the ice cream made upon order. It's a must!

Good pizzeria but too expensive in my opinion. You are just paying for being at Marina Bay Sands.Anyway trying to find cheap places in the surroundings of Marina Bay is just impossible so I guess the price is the standard. All the food we ate was fin
5
Watching the attention paid to the pizza base production was almost as good as the meals and service. The starters, pizza and desert were to die for. A little pricy but worth it. Book ahead.

This restaurant is a part of the Marina Bay Sands, and is one of their "signature" venues, backed by a famous chef, can't remember who...So it share the same strong suites as it's sister restaurants, great service and food. (The pizza is divine)But as it's sister restaurants, it's WAY over priced. (It's silly really, you can't even do substitutions of ingredients in a meal. But you can add (at a price), and remove (free). So my analysis of this is that they're so cheap that they don't allow for the possibility of missing out on a few $$$ by having guest substituting cheap ingredients for expensive ones. (Not our case, we wanted a slightly less spicy cheese on a sandwich). At this price point that shouldn't be an issue, and just seems unfriendly and a little thick headed... Also it's sort of formal, don't show up in t-shirt or flip-flops
1
Extremely high prices for average meals - Pizza @ $35++(!) for example - combined with pretentious serving staff made for a very ordinary dining experience. And they charge for a side order of bread ($2.00++ for two thin slices of French bread) - that we requested with our starters which came without bread (starters @ $20++). We definitely won't be back
4
This restaurant makes the most amazing pizzas - the crust is just melt in the mouth great and the fillings flavoursome and generous. The pizzas are made to your request so there is a little wait. The only down side to this restaurant is that the pizzas are expensive and the prices advertised in the menu are not the prices you pay - the extra taxes are all on top of the menu prices - one of my pet hates. My pizza, one cocktail and a coffee cost Sing$60
3
This was my second visit to the Pizzeria and although the quality of the pizza has slipped a little it is still a tasty authentic pizza option. The price of drinks is exorbitant, as with everywhere in MBS. The service was patchy and took a little shine off the night but overall a fair option if you are chasing a pizza
4
If you want to eat somewhere in Marina Bay to experience the atmosphere but not break the bank this is a good choice. Wine was fairly priced and the pizza selection was great. They managed to find us a table for two at the bar with no reservation. Had a long walk down the bay taking in the sky line after dinner to walk off the generous portions! Great night
5
We had a great meal here with friends during the F1. As walk-ins we had to wait 15 mins for a table (we were able to enjoy a drink & order our meals at the bar), but once we were seated, the service was efficient and our food served quickly. Beautiful pizzas and some of the best salads we've ever had. Lovely relaxed dining atmosphere perfect for a light lunch. No gluten free pizzas, but plenty of divine salad choices to keep me happy. Delicious
5
Pizzeria Mozza was fantastic, after eating here on my first night in Singapore. I made a point of visiting two more times before I went home 5 days later. This restaurant is popular, so reservations are necessary to not be disappointed. The arancini balls and the prawns were the best dishes
2
Honestly to me the Pizza wasnt good and takes a LONG time to get food to the table. Dough was thick and their sauce was overwhelming the whole pizza. People talk a lot about this place as its fancy and try to be upscale but their pizza is 2nd class to me losing to even some neighborhood delivery shops. Sure i place i wont go back.

my friend and i decided to eat at mario batalli's pizzeria for my birthday. we asked for the best sellers of their salad and pizza as there is quite a full list. we quite enjoyed the nancy's chopped salad and the prosciutto di parma pizza. the flavours are rich, very satisfying and original as i've never tasted before. the waiters are very nice with good sense of humour. they gave me a nice scoop of ice cream when they learned it was my birthday. good thing they didn't sing as i specifically asked them not to :
5
Excellent food quality, delicious pizza expertly cooked while you watch. A great place for a group of friends or colleagues in a stylish contemporary restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Will be returning over and over again I'm sure to try different dishes on the menu.
4
mozza served great food, the food was tasty, and the mushroom bruschette is amazing, my only concern is for the healthy foodies that the food had too much oil.
5
Pizzas in a real wood burning stone bake oven! We've been to Italy and these pizzas are the closest we've had to the real thing. Been back twice to this restaurant and would visit again.
4
Very nice pizza and appetizers. True Italian experience. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for!
5
One of my greatest experiences in a restaurant. Excelent service, personal and made our dinner complete experience. The food was mindblowing and the care and service our waitress gave us was probably even better! Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
5
Beautiful food and worth the price .Staff were lovely and the food served you just could taste the quality of the pasta and bread all made in-house
5
We stopped here for lunch. An excellent Italian restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands mall. We ordered pizza and pasta. The food was absolutely hot and delicious. Service was very attentive. It's a little pricey but so is everything in Singapore.
5
The service here was outstanding. You definitely feel like there is a lot of attentiveness for things that go beyond expectation. We got to try 2 delicious salads, spicy chicken wings, 4 pizzas (unfortunately I didn't do the ordering, so I don't know all the names) and dessert. My pick was the Aglio e olio with mozzarella, tomato & basil. Hands down the best one in my opinion and for others. :) If I had to guess on the others, we had the Fennel Sausage, panna, red onion and Scallions. The other was a meat lovers style and the other was something else with scallions. Sorry I can't remember. The dessert was also amazing.The reason why I would say the service is amazing is because when my 22 month old niece (who loves eating) decided to grab the spicy chicken wing and taste it when no one was looking, the waitress saw her crying and brought her a complimentary glass of fresh whole milk to soothe her. Great right!Another time, I said to my sister, who was sitting across from me, that I really needed an extra plate to cut up food for my 14 month old. All of a sudden an extra plate appeared. Haha. Sooo...maybe that sounds creepy, but it was nice. :)We would definitely come back again
3
Personally not a fan. We ordered a lot of stsrters and the portion sizes were small, average tasting and rather expensive. not much options for vegetarian folks in the starters. I think it gets a lot of foot traffic from the mall who want to eat a pizza as a quick and easy meal but you can eat better food elsewhere. Waiters try and constantly upsell you wine.
1
We went for dinner and the restaurant was busy - granted!Ordered a starter (olives) and pizzas as well as some drinks. Time passes and no starter shows up - so I query it with the waiter. After checking he came back and asked "if we still wanted the olives". There was never a question about that?!He then tried to cover it up as if everything was fine. His problem was that we were sat right next to the till and saw him enter the starter only after I queried it... Therefore the pizzas showed up just a couple of minutes after the "starter". I don't mind anyone making a mistake - if they own up to it!Trying to cover it up as badly as what happened here at mozza is just terrible!The food was alright but not worth the amount they are charging. I did not even bother trying to speak to a manager after I saw her handle a similar complaint at the table next to us. The family there had a similar issue and the only answer from the manager was "you will still be charged". It seems only money counts - customers are mere numbers and the service level is below acceptable
3
An ok place for a pizza, a nice touch is the open kitchen so you can see how your pizza is made. My pizza had a bit too much oil on it.
2
The pizza was not good. The mozzarella was poor and not abundant, the tomato tasted strange.
The dessert were not italian at all (also the icecreams).
Definitely Overvalued!!
I'll never go back there!!
4
Good food, nice choices.
Mario knows his stuff and uses quality ingredients
Best reasonable choice in the shops, which is not saying much for a way too high end mall.
5
This place has the nicest pizzas I have tasted anywhere with other food options as well. there is an impressive range of drinks as well.
5
We always go straight here after we watched at the MBS mastercard theater. Our regular order was the caprese salad, pizza margherita and drinks.
This visit we also tried the meatballs and the beet salad which is very good as well.
5
The customer service was impeccable and the food was great. I love the little bread crackers they brought to the table to begin with.
2
The most expensive and worst restaurant I've ever been. I ordered a bruschetta and a pizza margherita that tasted so bad that I couldn't eat them.
4
This place is good to go anytime you wish to try real good pizzas whether for dinner or even lunch. I have tried three different pizzas and all the three were equally good with the crust crispy and thin, nice bar to sit by and watch the pizzas being made in open whilst we could wait for a table. This place is always packed so reservation is recommended. Cant go wrong in choosing Mozza as one stop to make for pizzas when in Singapore. Good selection of wine list, simply making it the already worthwhile dinning place bette
5
Good pizza and service is generally ok. The entrees eg fried cauliflower, Nancy's chopped salad are yummy but the desserts have always disappointed. Have been here 10 times and tried most of the pizzas on the menu - the goats cheese and leek pizza and broccoli pizza are my favourites
4
We've been here a couple of times now, and it was an identical experience both times.We arrived for an early lunch, around 1230, with a booking (which is recommended). We were seated quickly and provided with some bland crispy bread, which is a waste of time. Save yourself for the actual food!This time saw the Margherita and Salumi Picante being the choices and they're both great. The former is a terrific traditional pizza with loads of depth, and the Salumi is a spicier option...not as spicy as it read, which was disappointing, but nice all the same. A glass of Pinot Gris and a Peroni on the side and it was a great early weekend feed.The service is fine - they're there and you can get what you want when you want it, but not overwhelming. They do get busy and clearly speed things up, and need to be managed to learn that yelling at each other across patrons is just not on. It seemed to happen a lot to us and everyone around us!Definitely head along if you're in the mood for some great traditional pizza - this is the best of this style that I've had in Singapore to date
4
Nice place to have variety of pizza. Price is high , but we are in singapore! It's a bit salty so do ask for less salty. reservation is required. Will I go back? Yes, at some special occasions. FYI, Not a very romantic place.
5
This is not a budget minded place - but it's fantastic. The highlight of the meal was the strawberry gelato pie - heavenly - but with a $19 price tag. The pizza a good. Service was great.
4
Had calamari and chicken wings as starters and a mushroom pizza as main - overall food was good and service staff were pretty attentive despite the busy lunch crowd. Meal cost 80++ for 2 pax - not exactly cheap.
5
Restaurant was busy, due to a show being on that night. They asked if we were attending the show that evening, nice touch! Ordered a margarita pizza and a goats cheese and leek pizza. Waitress came back to apologise - kitchen had run out of goats cheese, no problems - I just ordered something different. Ordered the salami pizza instead. Both pizzas were delicious - thin and crispy base, delicious toppings. Was surprised when paying the bill they didn't t charge me for me pizza - totally unexpected but appreciated - thank you! Didn't catch our waitresses name - lovely lady with braces :)
3
Honestly, I found the food completely underwhelming and mediocre. Pretty similar to any upscale pizza joint you'd find in the U.S. I definitely have to give them kudos for their service, however, which was exceptional. The place is immaculately run and everyone from the hostess, to the waitress and bussers were extremely professional and courteous. The place ran like clock work. Now if they could only take their food up a notch, they'd have something really special
5
Have lunched here many times in the pizzeria. Love the antipasto selection and usually share several plates with friends or my daughters. We love the complimentary crispy parmesan bread, the fruity iced teas and the pizza. Service is attentive if it's not busy, but slow if the place is full
3
I cannot help but make comparisons with Mario Batali's other pizzeria in NYC, Otto, which I found to be a good dining experience. This is how it stacks up:The Good: Antipasti selection was decent, though not as extensive. In particular, the Caprese salad was excellent. The wine list was approachable, with many decent choices in the $80-$100 range (reasonable for Singapore).The Not So Good: Menu was rather limited, they serve mainly pizzas only here. These came with a rather wide, BURNT crust, as already mentioned in other reviews. The problem was not the dough, which was tasty, but in the cooking process I felt. These pizzas look and taste totally different from the ones served in Otto (just look at the pictures in the reviews of that restaurant for comparison), I cannot fathom how a Pizzeria with this pedigree of branding can turn out this kind of pizza, but just looking at the pictures posted by other diners, their pizzas all look like the ones we got served. Or maybe it just me?The Bad: Wait staff are assigned to certain tables, but after sitting at our table for a full 15 minutes, it was not clear to us who our waiter was. Calling out and waving to passing waiters proved futile, while trying to get the attention of the hosts/hostesses was even more unfruitful as they DELIBERATELY avoided seeing or attending to seated patrons (I saw this repeated all around us, so I guess we were not treated any different). Finally had to walk up to the hostess and ask her which of the wait staff I should approach before we got attended to. To be fair, once we were attended to, the waitress was friendly, charming and attentive. I will not talk about value for money or cost. This restaurant is located in MBS Shoppes, prime real estate in Singapore, so it is totally unrealistic to expect it to be cheap or good value. I will say that it is the price one can expect to pay given the location.We are big fans of MB's food, Del Posto being one of our favourite restaurants, but this one closest to home leaves us underwhelmed, sad to say

We had eaten in quite a few Italian restaurant while we were in Switzerland last June. When we returned to Singapore, my husband would like to have a taste of Italian food in Singapore, also to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. The service of the waitress is excellent, but the pizza and salad is ok for us. Taste of food depends on personal taste anyway. We prefer the italian meals we had in Switzerland
4
We dined here for lunch as a family whilst waiting for our hotel room to become available. It had been recommended by a friend and we were glad to have followed advice to be there early! Within 1/2hr of us being seated the place was full. Wait staff were friendly, knowledgable and generally efficient. The pizzas were excellent and there was no problem with us sharing two between the four of us. Kids delighted in sitting at the bar area watching the food be created and placed in the giant pizza ovens - all adds to the experience. Would recommend this as a great family venue
5
Everything was perfect from start to finish. The food was AMAZING - I had the caprese salad as my starter and it really re-defines what you expect. The mozzarella just melts in your mouth, the tomatoes were roasted cherry tomatoes and the basil / pesto dressing was clearly homemade and absolutely delicious. I had a pizza for my main which was also absolutely wonderful, but they also do other specials each day - my husband had the duck and was equally impressed. The service was wonderful, they asked us for our dietary requirements immediately, the waiter knew all ingredients by heart, service was quick, the wine and the prosecco delicious. Cannot recommend enough! (And we are picky eaters!
5
Delicious pizza, perfect crust and really interesting toppings. Well worth a visit especially if you're staying at the marina bay sands as it is so close by.
5
I love the escargot , the pizza were perfectly done , all other food were perfect , chicken was well grill it's unforgettable .
4
Had a Fabulous evening
Great wine , lovely food and brill service
Highly recommend the restaurant
Always busy and buzzy
Staff can't do enough for you
Really recommend
4
Yes. True. Great authentic thin crust, minimalist toppings, accompanied with an Italian accent. American-friendly service. Alcohol is pricy.
5
For starters, we had bone marrow al forno, chicken wings alla Diavolo and two other dishes. For the main course we had pizza: Buricotta with peperonata,olive Taggiasche & oregano; and Fresh goat cheese, leeks, scallions, garlic & bacon. Dessert included Caramel copetta with marshmallow sauce & salted Spanish peanuts. Everything we ate was DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC. Good value for money, nice atmosphere, and prompt service. Highly recommended and I can't wait to go there again
4
Located within the Marina Bay Sands complex this is one of the "affordable" restaurants that has great food, fantastic staff and a bill that won't break the bank (at least for Singapore).The menu is mostly pizza with some great starters to share and a small selection of sandwiches. If you want a more substantial menu you need to go next door to their sister restaurant with prices that also go up.Make sure you reserve a table in advance as they fill up quickly
5
I've been coming to Mozza frequently since the day it opened a couple of years ago, but I've never written a review about the place until now, so this is looong overdue!The food here is simply fantastic: flavorful, rustic, and beautifully presented in a casual yet fun environment with excellent service. You simply can't go wrong at this place and there has yet to be a dish that hasn't impressed me - yes, the food is that consistently good. To kick things off, we have to talk about the pizza. After all, it is a pizzeria so this is easily the most important thing that they make at this restaurant (what good is a pizzeria that can't do a good pizza?). The crust and dough are magical; flavorful, perfectly cooked with a bit of crunch and softness that balances well to form a great base for all those yummy, wonderful ingredients that go on top of this circular creation that must have fallen from heaven. There is a wide variety of pizzas to chose from (I want to say around 20 if memory serves me correctly); from the simple everyday Margherita pizza that you are used to to some that have more rustic and exotic Italian flavors that you wouldn't necessarily find elsewhere in Singapore.Besides the dough, the sauces and toppings are simply stunning, and I find for the quality that you are getting it is also great value (we had a pizza the other night that had Speck and Mozzarella/Burrata on it that was only S$30). Cooking it all in an awesome wood fired oven also helps add to the experience as well. All those elements combined is why I think they have the best pizza in town. The rest of the menu is also quite good. There is a plethora of antipasti and starters to chose from that are all delish. A consistent favorite of ours is their take on a Caprese salad with a soft and creamy Mozzarella/Burrata, with pesto drizzled on top, basil and roasted tomatoes on the vine. It is MIND BLOWING how good it is and easily the best Caprese salad I have ever had anywhere in the world, albeit if it is a bit unconventional. If you love Caprese salad, you need to get this. I would advise to come hungry and get a couple of dishes and pizzas to split if you are not dining alone. You will likely leave here satisfied and looking forward to your next visit as we so often have. Make a reservation too, as walk-ins are tough during normal dinner hours (we walked in around 6:00pm or so and the place was already packed on a Sunday night; they only had bar seating left)
5
Went to this place recently on sunday and booked for 9.30 seating for two. Tried the melon and shrimp starter followed by one of the best thin crust wood fire pizza This restaurant is one of the busiest restaurant of Marina sands and truly deserve the full stars Would love to be back soo
4
Went for dinner over the weekend. The pizzeria side and not the fine dining side.Did not make reservation but was lucky enough they have space at the bar and that where we were seated. So suggestion, reservation is recommended.The place was full but the speed of the service was still good. However, not much else can be said about the staff … they all seemed busy and running around.We ordered 2 starters and one pizza to share. We had the meatballs which was nicely done and tasty. We also had Lentil with goat cheese … great combo and very nice. Main course … pizza and yes we were not disappointed .. super thin crust and delicious. Definitely would go back again. Pizza is a must :
4
The Pizza here is always great and so are most of the other dishes. Service here is also very good; on our last trip here, our starter took a long time to come, so the manager took it off our bill and gave it to us for free without us having to ask. I think that is quite rare in Singapore? One thing to note is that the place is very tightly packed and very noisy. Its really quite hard to have a conversation. The lighting is also quite dim
5
My wife and I went in as part of a party for 10 and the service and food were incredible! We sampled a good portion of the menu and there was nothing that didn't taste good. Pizza's were a highlight!
4
The pizza was alright. Nice flakey base. Not really a muslim friendly pizza repertoire as my boyfriend prefers no pork. Friendly bar staff.
3
Having read good reviews of this restaurant we made a reservation for one evening. Clearly that was essential because it was extremely busy and not a spare table to be seen. We had great difficulty finding it within the huge Marina Bay Sands shopping Mall but finally got there. The tables are close-packed and it's very noisy so not an ideal place if you want to have a conversation. The staff were very efficient and friendly and we liked the little touches like the parmesan crisps and the towelettes. However, in the final analysis these were just pizzas and, good though they were, we thought they were expensive - from S$28 up - and the wine was S$19+ per glass. Fine for a good quick meal but not really for an evening out
4
This pizzeria is very interesting place but for my taste a little to noisy. Pizza was very good although dough had strong taste of doughnuts (!?). On staff, even though they were very fast and helpful you can't escape that feeling that they want you out of the place as soon as possible. I was literally chewing my last bite (of 35$ pizza!) when my plate, glasses and all table were cleared. I was definitely not feeling very welcome
4
Bar the odd rule (see below), this is a terrific place - great pizzas, amazing chopped salad and lots of very interesting dishes. It is also very versatile - perfect for a quick bite with a multitude of small starters or for a longer meal by adding a few pizzas/main courses to the order. They keep the best for last - chef Adriana's desserts are simply outstanding. A seasonal Meyer lemon ice-cream pie was mind-blowing and the regular items are superb... including the must try copetta.Service is very good (aside from a rather stern looking lady we actively try to avoid) - some really excellent individuals there.On the odd rules, seems to be a staple of the Mozza way - ask for a substitution in the affetiti misti plate and you're met with a scared look and immediate refusal (although they later complied) and, frankly entirely inexplicably, one can only order 1 flavour each of the sorbets as part of the 3-scoop cup... why that is is beyond human investigation.That notwithstanding, really great place - if they can relax a bit this is here to last for a very long time, one hopes
5
this is definitely one of the best place that i ever went for a pizza its not classical italian pizza more like american italian pizza (los angeles is the first branch of pizzeria/osteria mozza)it has various filling in the pizza menusother than pizza menus, it also has other various italian dishes Nancy's chop salad is one that you should try and i remember the Bone marrow was also super nice the oven baked rumanesco was also something that you should try the pizzas.... you don't even need to ask.. it's a must try i can only say good things about this placeit has two different sectionsif you are looking for a more casual kinda of atmosphere, go to pizzeria mozzaif you are looking for a more extinguished kind of atmosphere, then you should try osteria mozzaas i could recall, we can have both menus in those two placesthe idea is that in osteria, they serve more menus whereas in pizzeria is more like finger foods and pizzasanother thing is that they also have chef's tasting menu where they prepare the food all in small portions but numerous of them :)i have visited the one in LA as well as the one in singaporeboth are very satisfactory a job well done to MOZZA team who made it all possible next time i go, i want to try the cheese stuffed ravioli that is nicely photographed in their MOZZA cook book :
5
I'm Italian and my expectations about pizza are always conditioned when I eat it on the other side of the world, like here in Singapore.I've been in Pizzeria Mozza with my wife, and it really surprised us. Olives starter was incredibly tasty, and the two pizzas we tried amazing.Whilst the dough was a little too thick, the mixture of ingredients is original and exquisite.It's not a place where you go to look for a traditional pizza, is more a chief's pizza and the ingredients are really high level.Suggested
4
Sitting down at the pizza bar watching how your artisanal pizza been made.Start with Mozza style Capresse with garlicky Fettunta Toast.Next,come with the super crispy crust and yeasty pizza.The Burrata pizza , Magharita pizza and prosciutto de parma pizza is the must ordered pizza, because it so classic and delicious. Cherry is in season now so order their mix berry copeta and maraschino gelato for desert.The best casual high end pizza bar you ever had in Singapore.
4
Came in to dine before a musical so didn't have a lot of time to spare. The staff were aware and brought the food out fast and made some great recommendations. We say at the bar where we were mixed up some fantastic cocktails also. I had the wagyu beef dish which was one of the best I had tasted. It was sitting on oil and balsamic vinegar so nice Italian feel to it. Recommend it to all for a premium dining experience
5
We treated ourselves to a pizza meal and were not disappointed. Each of the three that we ordered were absolutely delicious, and we finished every bite. I highly recommend the all-meat pizza (excellent salumi), as well as anything with fresh, seasonal vegetables. Great service. Priced accordingly. Will definitely go back for high-quality, authentic pizza, and now I want to try the Osteria...
5
The freshly based pizza with European ambience is all you can expect at Pizzeria. You do not miss out on Italy whenever you are at this place
5
Hands down my favourite pizza spot in Singapore. Always packed and understandable, service, food and drinks are all executed above average. Will be back for sure.
4
This is a nice place for pizza in the mall near Marina Bay Sands hotel. I tried the chorizo pizza with chili, which could have been a bit more spicy but altogether a good experience. The staff were very welcoming and helpful.
5
We had just finished up the Gardens by the Bay light show and was making our way back to our hotel. We decided to stop at the mall and grab some food but reluctant to eat fast food. So we stumbled upon Pizzeria Mozza by Mario Batali. We were told they were fully booked but to leave our number just in case. In less than 15 minutes, I received a call that we could have two seats at the bar. The service was excellent. The pizza by far was the best, even better than the ones we have in Dubai, where we live. We couldn't have been more pleased
4
We rocked up on a VERY busy Saturday lunchtime and were seated at the bar. This turned out to be great as the efficient and friendly batman James was a great host. We waited about 40 minutes for our pizza and salad, but enjoyed a couple of cocktails in the interim. Our pizza was lovely and thin and crispy, with good quality toppings, though a little sparse. Our spinach salad was lovely and fresh, would have enjoyed the anchovies to be chopped up through the salad, but that is a minor gripe
4
I went for lunch with a friend on his recommendation and was not disappointed. The beet root salad was amazing. Sourdough pizzas are excellent. The thin crust is delicious and it's worth going if only to sample these. Get a seat by the window and people watch over a lazy lunch. Reservations are advised as this place has a great reputation and it gets very busy !!
5
Even before leaving for Singapore I already told myself that I will dine in here as a treat to myself. and boy, am I glad I did that little commitment as it was heaven for the taste buds!I highly recommend visiting this quaint, homey place that Chef Batali and his associates have concocted for us to enjoy his luscious meals.We came in mid afternoon so there's no need for a reservation and was received very well by the staff. loved those crunchies they give out while waiting for our orders to arrive. I definitely will go back here and highly recommend you treat yourself too! Mr Batali definitely walks the talk
3
My cousin said lets have good pizza so we zoomed over here. Its a tad expensive but the pizza's good, at least better than CPK's. The menu is limited so you better choose of you will eat at the pizzeria or the fine dining rest. You can't cross over orders even if i suspect that they share one kitchen. Pizza is good but don't expect cheap price
2
Pizza is dinner plate sized and costs roughly $25-30. Toss in the drinks and the bill is substantial. While some friends continue to like the food and insist we meet there, I have never been overly impressed. Pizzas tend to come loaded with argula or so many other greens, they might as well be a salad with dough on the bottom.
4
We arrived on time for our booking but the front desk staff acted like they were surprised to see the seven if us. We had to wait for a short while for the staff to clear a table for us. Apart from this hiccup, we managed to have a great time. The wine was good, the pizzas and other dishes were delicious, and the wait staff were reasonable. The place was noisy, but then, I guess, this formed part of the atmosphere. Not an outstanding restaurant for food, but great for an evening out with friends.
5
Crispy dough, tasty pizza, and fabulous atmosphere.
Advice.... ask a seat at the bar !
A minor weakness however, it is very difficult to book by phone. So go there and try your luck!

Pizzeria Mozza is a casual pizza dinning place by celebrity chef Mario Batali. It’s at Marina bay sands. Well, the restaurant has two parts, the typical dinning space and the bar-seats area. We picked the bar seats as it was more casual (Actually there weren't any other seats available.LOL). The bar-seats are located around the pizza kitchen where you can watch the chefs make your pizza from scratch. It’s quite entertaining to watch to them at work, while you wait around twenty minutes for your pizza to be served. We ordered the highly touted roasted potatoes with rosemary and thyme for starters. It was served with garlic-sour cream. The potatoes were fresh and the subtly spiced. The crunchiness of the chickpeas added the oomph-factor to the dish. The Menu had around three or four vegetarian pizzas so we asked the waiter to serve us the most popular vegetarian choice, which turned out to be the mushroom pizza. The 10" pizza base was thin and crispy at the centre but the sides were buffed up. It was just cheese and variety of mushrooms! They didn't use any pizza sauce and I would say, that was a wise choice as it enhanced the natural flavor of the mushrooms. . Every single bite of it oozed freshness and flavor of the mushrooms. Certainly one of the best wood fired pizzas available in SG! We ordered butterscotch budino (pudding) instead of our usual tiramisu and panna cotta. It was quite salty. Upon enquiring, we found out that they used sea salt for seasoning. The caramel and butterscotch bits didn't save the dish from sinking to the undesirable mark! Thumbs down! The pine nut cookies were ok though. It costs around $70 per pax for a three-course meal. On the whole, it’s a good place to enjoy good pizzas with good company over bar-seats PS: Please make a reservation around two to three weeks in advance if you're planning to dine on a weekend. I was told to do so when I called them on the day itself. We walked-in as they were fully booked for the evening (5pm mind you!) and we were told that only bar seats are available and even for that, we've to wait for an hour and we headed to high society for pre-dinner drink

We came for a late lunch. We started with the caprese salad and the salad with avocado i am sorry i forgot the name. And we also had margherita, very crispy and tasty. It was the best we had in Sg. And we learn about this place as recommended by an uncle taxi driver

We came here regularly whilst living in Singapore. It's in Marina Bay Sands Mall, which certainly caters to tourists, as does this restaurant, but it genuinely is a great spot to pop to the counter/bar for great thin crust pizza, a few antipasti, olive oil gelato, and some decent wine or Peroni. It's Singapore, and you're in MBS, so the prices are higher than you may normally pay for pizza etc but it reliably good. The homemade sausage, pepperoni, kale -- all good options. Would highly recommend this over the Osteria next store, for the value, vibe and overall quality. Ideal if you can go after the theater crowd departs. Never made a reservation -- we always just walked in and sat at the pizza counter or bar, and rarely had a wait. Good for groups, couples or sol

If you want to visit a Pizza restaurant with a difference - then Mozza is it. Be warned tho - it will be busy, it will be noisy 'but' the food will be delicious. We could not fault any of the food and the Pizzas were thin but served deliciously hot from the wood fired ovens. Highly recommend for service, cost and quality of food. Maybe the music could be turned down a little as to be honest it was a tad over the top

I usually do not review restaurants in Singapore as we live here but this one was not a pleasant experience. While making the booking for a group of 10 including 3 children they said they cannot give a table of more than 8. If you want a bigger group there is a minimum spending requirement which is steep. If you try making the reservation on the day itself chances are you will not get it. Food is so so and service is very ordinary. Our friend has this habbit of tipping waiters even in Singapore and the waiter who took our order did not show his face after the tip.....Can easily give it a miss. Not good if you want to go there for a quite evening as the chatter is too loud..

The food is really good! That was the first impression when we first tried it. Sadly, we could only do a take-away at that time as the place was fully booked (as always).Then, this time we made a reservation to make sure that we will get a table. Luckly we did as the waiting guests without reservations were quite a crowd. We ordered the meatballs, again, as this is our favorite item there. It came as expected: juicy and succulent meatballs with chunky marinara sauce. Besides the meatballs, we also had the baked asparagus, arrancini, and pizza with homemade sausage. The asparagus is fresh, just perfectly cooked. It was served with prosciutto and parmesan. The prosciutto is not too salty, so it complement the asparagus well. For the arancini, well, it was the first time we tried the dish, but we like it. It came with bolognese sauce so it is a nice alternative to enjoy bolognese other than with pasta. The pizza of homemade sausage and leeks is kinda weird first. It has no marinara sauce as most pizza and may be that's why it feels pretty dry, too. But the sausage is tasty. Starting from the second slice, we are kinda get used to the pizza and start liking it. The service is very good. The servers are eager to serve the guests; they patiently listen to the guests' orders. This was not only happening at our table but also at tables around us and by servers other than ours. They paid good attention to the table. The empty plates did not stay long on the table because they often came and checked and then cleared up

I had returned to Mozza few days ago and while the ambiance of the place is very nice and service in friendly, I found again the food rather poor. Ordered first one plate of Parma ham with Buffalo Mozzarella: ham was very nice but the mozzarella was just a tiny piece. Then a Pizza Margherita arrived and this was a total disappointment. I am Italian and I believe I have good benchmarks of how a good pizza should be. Overly burned on the sides, very little cheese and somehow spiced with something like chilly...plus 2 glasses of red wine was 130+ dollars which I judge over expensive

It's not your normal pizza that you have in a trattoria. It's New York and it's good. The atmosphere was buzzing and the pizza was delicious. Service was attentive and the menu spread is wide. Overall a very good experience. The place is super busy yet when your food arrives, it's done perfectly. Keep it up

Visited for New year eve dinner. Calamari starter was excellent. Drinks are great too. Must try the Margarita. The way pizza is served with freshness and woodfired is top quality. The service and the food were great. Topping combinations are excellent. Must visit for pizza lovers

We always visit this place when we go and the pizza is thin and delicious. Worth the visit it is not cheap but not a over the top either

We used to eat at Mozza at least once every other month as the pizza is some of the best in Singapore, the salads are excellent, the appetizer selection is unique, and the wine list is extremely accessible (ie a good selection between 60 and 90 $/bottle). However, during the last two visits the parking garage was closed off and we had to park all the way at the other end in the convention center and walk the length of the mall each way to get there. The first time it was closed it was for some VIP event. The second time, no idea why but it was really irritating. This means that we can no longer slip in and out for a nice quick lunch, but rather, need to make a whole afternoon of it. It's unfortunate, but the planners of the whole MBS complex forgot to make enough parking. So, a great place to go if you're planning to make a visit to Mozza part of a whole afternoon at the mall, but not for a nice leisurely lunch.

Walked-in on Christmas Eve for dinner (it was our 2nd time there), and we were ushered into a bar seat right by the wine bar where the bartender was.The service was quick, and the staff was friendly and helpful despite the restaurant bustling with the dinner crowd. We ordered a Aracine as an entree, and boy we were not disappointed. Though the portions was a tad too small, we could taste the quality that the chef had put into making the plate of aracine (rice balls). An order of a Funghi Pizza followed, and the pizza was baked just right in the oven, with their usual thin crust and a generous portion of mushroom toppings.Satisfied on both times we were there, this is one place that makes a mean pizza, much better than other mid-to-high-end pizza restaurants.Some people say that you have to have a reservation, but I have walked in twice and gotten a seat very quickly. The bar seats are the best seats if you go there as a couple. If you are going there with friends or family then the table seats would be a much better option

I like my woodfire pizza alot, and I've had some great ones here in Australia and even in Italy, and the pizza ia great here too, quite authentic. However it is very dear, and this isn't the fine dining part of Mozza. Shelled out nearly $80 for like two pizzas and a dessert and drinks, but it was still niceBook your reservation!!

The food is fantastic here. Unusual and excellent pizzas; some outstanding appetizers (eg. Chicken liver bruschette, stuffed zucchini flowers, bone marrow). Service is efficient by a friendly staff. The main reason not to come here more often (or to the more elaborate Osteria) is the need to deal with the aggressive receptionists, either when making a reservation by phone or when showing up at the restaurant. They may have received some advice from the owners recently for they're no longer rude; but they're still the least pleasant and most unfriendly receptionists in town - quite unacceptable at this price level

Dropped by for lunch with my work colleagues. Staff was helpful and kind enough explaining the menu to us. Ordered mushroom pizzas and a chicken dish (sorry I forgot the name). Well, the food was simply superb. And we still talk about our lunch up till now... ha ha.... :-
