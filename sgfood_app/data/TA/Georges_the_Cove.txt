Fish and Chips beer battered was not as good and served with cold fries. The pork knuckle was overcooked. The food was not the standard of the price.

My favourite hangout with my buddies!
Food is awesome, Guinness is fresh, and the staff are all friendly and welcoming. The place to go for chill out sessions in the East.

GEORGES @ THE COVE located in Pasir Ris (eastern side of Singapore) is a hidden neighborhood bar & restaurant by the sea. There is a sheltered area for non-smoking section. Friendly staff, great food and nice music. Their beef burger is so yummy! Weekdays Happy Hour till 9pm.

This is a cool laid back place to have drinks and watch the sunsets. Staff like Mr Kumar always have a friendly hello, and help customers feel welcome.Foodwise, it is okay. We have eaten a few dishes, such as fish and chips, nasi goreng, the lot burger and prawn alio olio, and the taste was alright, but nothing outstanding. More ingredients would be welcomed too; for instance, the rice had a chicken wing and basically ikan bilis mixed in, while there were only four prawns in the pasta.We enjoy the luncheon meat chips though, which go well with the BBQ sauce and sliced onions.Do note they are open for dinner only, and the Asian dishes are not available on weekdays

Food was not too bad, but service was bad.1.) Made a reservation at 8pm but when we arrived, we were told that we were late, saying our reservation was at 7pm. No apologies for their mistake but nevertheless, gave us a table (lucky for that).2.) Standard vday 3 course meal: Clam chowder soup, grilled salmon/steak/lobster (but lobster was alrdy sold out by 8pm), red velvet lava cake.3.) Waited quite some time for the main course (we ordered salmon) but it's okay. The last straw was when we asked for the dessert a couple of times after we finish our main course, waited at least for 30mins before I called out to the waiter again saying we have waited for the dessert for very very long, even the tables after us have alrdy gotten their dessert. Looking by the way they behave, it seems like they have forgotten to serve our dessert to us and the best part comes when the dessert came was a brownie instead of the red velvet lava cake. I asked the waiter abt it and we were told the red velvet lava cake was sold out. Firstly, was it my fault that we were "late" and they ran out of the lava cake? No! It's bcos they missed out and forgot to serve us on time, thus we are unable to get the lava cake. Secondly, if the food stated in the menu was sold out, sldnt they inform us? Instead of just serving the "alternative". Thirdly, the waiter said he will feedback to the manager and no follow up was done with us. They just conveniently let this fade away.TOTALLY NOT RECOMMENDED, even though the food was alright

Having only previously been here for dinner after it’d already turned dark, I realise now how pleasant it is to just sit at the cafe in the late afternoon when it’s breezy and overcast. A very relaxing experience.Try the luncheon chips together with the onions. They taste surprisingly good together

Nice pub located by the water, which is quite pleasant normally. Unfortunately for us, it was raining heavily and the experience was not so nice, as several areas are unprotected.Food was OK, but portions not so big for the price.Atmosphere is laid back and nice. I'll probably come back for drinks on a sunny day

This restaurant looks like any other food bar by the sea, which I wasn't really expecting any raving comments but it proved me wrong.We were warmly welcomed by the host and brought to a nice seat where we could get a really good sea view. Servers were very attentive and friendly throughout. Menu range is quite wide, spanning western and local fare. Pleasantly surprised by the food quality and taste. We ordered the beef slider, satay, ribs, lamb shank and fish n chips. They all tasted above average, in fact, much better than many full-fledged restaurants in town. I've not had such good fish n chips for a long while. The batter was fresh and crisp and not too thick that you can literally enjoy the crunch with the fish still moist and flavorful.Definitely worth the visit!

Stopped for a drink and some nibbles while at the park with the family. Great deck to enjoy a cold one and a cool breeze. Food quality was hit and miss. Sliders were tasty and nachos were decent if basic. Wings lacked any real flavour (we ordered original). Decent beer and drink list and large food menu as well.
4
Decided to drop as as we are living close by. Food was ok, but steak is cooked well as opposed to Medium. Service was good and beer cold. Happy to return again. Great breeze from the sea.
4
If you want a place with good food, at reason price. Be here. The waiters and waitresses are great. They make the difference.
4
There are lots of fried food that will go well with beer. A few menus for kids. Good to go with kids before sunset.
4
This is a wonderful out of town place where the food is good, the environment wonderful, and the staff are friendly.
3
Nice location tucked on the edge of the water at Pasir Ris Park. Cool breeze in the evening. 90s music. Great spot for casual dining and drinks. Food was so so for me.
5
1st time having family gathering outing here & had a great experience.
Nice ambience & food not bad too.
Good service provided.
Shall return for 2nd dining here again.

Today i visited the place with my family. The floor staff is not customer friendly and responsible. The lead butler gave two Fork in the beginning and one plate. We were four. This is not acceptable. Every time we need we need to keep calling them and ask. The attitude totally wrong. Common guys we are the customers and not you. You are still in business because of us. Keep that in Mind.But Rayan was one of the two guys who was always smiling and very courteous and know how to engage us and feel comfortable. The other lady staff forgot her name was also very cheerfully serving us.All the other staff useless. The Lady with the Tatoo she was so arrogant and i could hear her passing funny comments about other customers. I am sure she is doing same about me as well behind my Back.The food is good. But service bad.I have been to George's by the bay in Pungol Multiple times. Their team is excellent and excellent service.

Hidden in Pasir Ris park, Georges @ the Cove is an unassuming little hut that serves good local food by the sea.The place is not air-conditioned, but we enjoyed a good night breeze. The menu is quite extensive - from meats to fish to pastas - but the local menu is only available on weekend. The happy hour rates seem reasonable too. I'm sure we'll be back soon

Invited at a larger gathering with my family. Great location for a Saturday night easy laid back casual dinner. My kids reported that the burgers were 'ok', my friends told me the chicken was bad - I had a 'seafood basket' with some overly cereals battered prawn, some other structures that might have been fish and more un-identifiable material. These might have been several times in the same over-used frying oil perhaps. Bland and actually rather disgusting. Tasted like plastic bags. Sent back with a note to the kitchen - not even an acknowledgement.Not a place to eat. TripAdvisor asks me to rate. I do not want to give it even one dot but I have to otherwise it won't register..

The truth is I got my credit card back after some frantic chasing of the person who signed my bill and kept my credit card. More importantly I kept my cool and showed no anger. In fact I thanked them and walked away. I was waiting for the boss or the senior guy in charge there to offer something to me but he didn't. That will be the last time I visit this really "actually quite well located" eatery. Even the patron on my next table waited 45 minutes for his meal to arrive and he raised his voice but did not blow his top.The food? it was truly not the reason we came as a family for the food. It was not only average but it was expensive. But it faces the beach and I can should pay premium for that so I don't mind truly average food but with great ambience and access to a very decent car park. I was prepared to come again next time but the credit card issue was really a low for me. I wish the owners well when they read this so that they can improve their systems and maybe change the chefs or the pricing. Its not easy to run any F and B establishment but people come back for reasons that they know well but those that don't come back also deserve a hearing

We liked this place. We there hungry after an afternoon of Cycling in the also lovely Pasir Ris park. Great burger, good fish and chips and nice views over the sea. Give it a try!
4
A variety of menu to choose from, great for families with kids, friends gathering or couples who seek a beautiful night atmosphere. Perfect for a laid-back meal or chill out session by the beach.
4
Restaurant food & setting were reasonable good but marred by chope booking not registered at Georges@cove. finding a table for 7 was too tough & waited 40 mins. the waiters were friendly & very apologetic though.
4
The food a hit n miss. Some are good while others are so so. However, we gone there for the beachfront setting.
5
Great place to chill and hangout. The food is nice and the view is awesome! Taste of music also was wonderful. Recommended!

We went on a Sunday evening. The place was crowded with family and so we thought the food must be good. We ordered steak, meatball spaghetti, salmon salad, bratwurst and fish basket. Spaghetti sauce tasted straight out of a jar and meatball was tough with plenty of tendons. Steak was chewy and lukewarm. Salad was dried, almost like left out for too long. Don't deserve even 1 star except for the location. Definitely wouldn't recommend nor coming back

Just had dinner with my family at Georges. Everything started out smoothly when we took our table at 7pm. We asked to have our order taken and a waitress (lanky, fair-skinned Chinese local lady with a long ponytail) heard our request, and passed us on to another lady whom she called "Mel" (I believe she's Filipino). Mel was warm, friendly and really nice. Patiently took all our orders from my 7-year-old, repeated them, and she moved on.Food started being served shortly (mains way ahead of starters - but that didn't bother me too much). Soon, everyone had their food, but we were missing 2 portions of beer battered fish & chips. We knew it was getting busy so we waited patiently. We were seated just right outside the kitchen counter, and at one point saw 2 portions of beer battered fish & chips sitting there for a while. Thought those were ours but they disappeared to another table. When the rest of the family was almost finishing their meal, I asked about the fish & chips. The staff member (local Malay guy) checked, and came back shortly with one portion and said the other will follow shortly.Another 20 mins passed and we were still waiting (by then it was way past an hour into the meal). Finally I asked another service staff - this time the same lanky Chinese lady who first passed us on to Mel. Without responding to me, she turned to the kitchen, spoke with a cook and went off without coming back to let me know what was going on. I had to flag her down again and asked her for the update. She simply said "its in progress" in a deadpan voice and walked away briskly, with no apology at all. By that point, I was pretty miffed by her attitude and lack of service. I have no idea what "in progress" means - there was a mix up and they missed my order? Or the chef would get to it at some point? How long more do I (& the rest of the family staring at their empty plates) have to wait?As we continued to wait, a lady from another table walked up to a service staff in front of the kitchen counter and said she had waited for more than an hour for her food. She was clearly displeased. I also saw a lady from yet another table going forward to help herself with the menus as her table had been neglected for a while. A man sitting at a table behind me started gesturing to ask for someone to take their order. While all these was going on, the Chinese staffer was zipping through the area in front of the kitchen counter, looking like she was really busy but I had no idea what she was doing. She wasn't serving food, nor taking orders, nor clearing dishes from tables, nor communicating with the kitchen. It was a display of chaos with no purpose. When the food finally arrived, served by the Malay guy, he apologised sincerely, which I was grateful for. But the Chinese female staffer had pissed me off enough to take away my appetite. I didn't finish my meal and asked for the bill. She came with it and I told her given what had happened, I don't think I should be paying for service at all. She stared at me for a second, and walked away (once again, no apology or explanation) to the bar counter, calling out for someone I assumed was her manager.A man returned with the revised bill, saying he had deducted 10% off our bill. But there was no apology from him too. I spoke gently but firmly with him. I told him I understand that it was a busy night and from our view right outside the kitchen counter, it was clear that communication between service and kitchen was chaotic. However, it didn't warrant the lack of communication and poor service from the particular female staffer. He nodded, said he would "speak to the kitchen".I left and quite sure I won't return again. It's such a shame as I believe it is at a great location & offers a great selection of food. In fact, I told my husband at the start of the evening that this is a great place to have drinks on our date night. I understand how crazy a weekend could mean to an F&B business, and I'm not expecting fine dining service at an outdoor alfresco. But there is a bare minimum level of expected service, and unfortunately Georges didn't meet that tonight

We had a reservation but unfortunately when we ( 16 of us ) were told no covered seat available unless we take the open space table n risked getting drenched . Unfortunately the waiter who relayed the message was very rude . Food n ambience is good if not for the above incident . Serving of food was not in sequence . Overall service was good .Note: fortunately the weather was good

Two of us arrived here at around 7pm and the place was quite crowded. But the turnover is fast and hence short waiting time. Nice ambient with sea view. Food is average but pricing reasonable. We ordered seafood Hor Fun (not bad) and grilled pork chop (so so). Service was quick. Would recommend to come here for a relaxing night out.

The place is set right by the beach and u can look at the sky change its colours when the sun set. Happy hour is very easy on the pocket and the food is amazing. Only downside is tt my gf was attacked by mosquitoes and we saw a rat dash by. Perhaps some pest control installations can be made to make the experience even better:)

Excellent and friendly service.
Good choice of food and beverages, excellent quality.
Perfect location to relax by the sea (Johor Strait) looking towards Pulau Ubin.
3
Perfect location in Pasir Ris Park, friendly staff. Pub style menu with something for everyone, worth a try if you're in the area
5
We enjoy the view and the breeze by the shore :) Excellent location to be at if you love the sound of waves and the cooling breeze 😎
4
Good place to chill out besides the sea on a rainy evening. On other days it may be a bit warm. The scenic view of pulau ubin island is also good.
4
I'm a regular here. Very cozy atmosphere and sentimental music. Recently they have a smoking corner and it's a plus point! Various variety of food menu.
5
Great place inside pasir ris park. Spare ribs are so tender and a must try calamari skewers. You should be seated before sunset to enjoy the view while drinking a cold beer. Highly recommended place... but you need to walk inside the park to find the place.
4
Good selection of food and beverage. Quality of food was good too. Service staff were a lil slow but totally understandable as it was a busy night. Location and view made up for this slight downfall.However, i would like to highlight on a particular staff who was really rude and unwelcoming. Totally unprofessional and his lack of customer service is questionable on how he is in this industry. After a lil "interview" with one of the staff we found out that he is actually the outlet manager. Even more appalling..If not for the food, drinks and the rest of the staff (Mel and her team), this place would be nothing.
3
It was a good experience. Lovely ambience. But the food Was not pleasing. All the spicy wings I bought were undercooked and had blood. The Chilli was full of seeds, it was a great turn off. I hope the food quality will be better in future.
5
Nice place to have a drink and some food with a couple of friends and enjoy the ocean breeze. The prices are reasonable and it is usually not too crowded therefore you can have a decent conversation with your buddies. It is quite inconvenient to come here by public transport but a taxi/uber ride from Pasir Ris is relatively cheap (~$5)

A nice place to sit, chat and dine by the beach. After taking a stroll, drop by Georges @ the Cove to chill out. A good place for us as we were able to dine with our furkids. This was a bonus. Staff were friendly and even brought a bowl of water for our furkids. Food was acceptable and will definitely be back with our furkids.
