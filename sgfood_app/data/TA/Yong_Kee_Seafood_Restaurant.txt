Been heard from a friend on this crispy vermicelli. Went to try but for me personally it is not crispy enough and the taste is normal. However, it is still recommend to try as your taste might be different

This coffee shop serves the best Tze Char! Though small but a huge range of menu!
The must try- Mee Sua Kor, Chow Tar bee hoon, seafood tofu, smelly beans, nai bai veg.
Other ala-carte dishes are also delicious!
Two thumbs up! üëçüëç

Very good bee Hoon. Fish is fresh. Didn't try the rest such as salted egg prawns and chilli crab. Park opposite at URA public car park.

We ordered our usual favorites which is the wok-fried bee hoon and seafood tofu.The bee hoon was fried with a slight crisp with great flavor, served with lard. The tofu is homemade from soya milk which you could detect. End product is very silky and tender.

Stayed in nearby hotel in little india, most nights this place was crowded to the extent that they had people using tables in nearby Indian bar/restaurant. Decided to try it out and have to say food was delicious. The price of same was really good no hidden taxes as per usual in Singapore. Braised pork ribs, stir fried beef in ginger and two steamed rice 22 sg $. Highly recommended

I have been coming for years and the dishes have been consistent, though the service still lacks!The bee hoon was well fried and served with lard. The tofu was super tender, fermented paste pork, prawn paste chicken and salted chicken were all delicious. Prices are reasonable and dishes are pretty quick to arrive. Non-descript place and highly recommended.

There has been a slight rave about their Tze Char being very good, but I was disappointed by my experience. The Chao Tar Bee Hoon for example, one of their signature dishes was off in my opinion. For me a good Chao Tar Bee Hoon should be slightly charred and crispy on the outside, but flavourful and slightly moist on the inside. The one we had that evening was crispy on the surface, dry on the inside and definitely lacking in taste and flavour. Just my preference on the way the Chef prepare their food, but I feel that there are better Tze Char out there

Back to this place for its chao Tar bee hoon for the second time, being intro by a friend. The place is located inside a kopitiam nearby sim Lim tower and little Indian. The place is hot, however it is the only joint with specialty such as the chao Tar been hoon. Everyone who ate there will definitely ordered this dish, the order and serving is fast. The bee hoon will be crispy on the top while the below is fry together with prawn, fish cake and pork. Highly recommended to try this

Going back to Singapore during chinese new year means food, food and more food! After eating rich "chinese food" for 2 weeks daily, I was longing for something indigenous of Singapore. My very good friend decided to take me to Yong KeeSeafood restaurant to eat " Zhi Cha". A method of frying that depended upon the skill of the Chef using "wok heat" to produce the " taste " of the dish. The better the Wok heat usuage the better the flavours of the dish is brought out! The open air table set up on the side street is a seldom and disappearing way of being able to eat food in Singapore. This way of eating on the five foot way used to be commonplace for restaurants in the past but today it is a novelty. The ambience of the going ons on the street, the sounds and smells of the cars, food and fresh open air encourages the apetite and allows your mind to drift backwards to how it was in Singapore before todays modernisation. Just fantastic. The signature dish of " burnt rice noodles" = " chao ta bee hoon" was really delicious with moist ingredients of prawns, juicy squids and more. The crusty crispy rice noodles were so flavorful, tasted of the "wok heat" and the aroma wad just heavenly! See photos. The chili and pepper crab were spicy and fresh. Fried " mun toe "s were ordeed to use as sponges for the gravy. On the whole the food was scrumptious, the open air dinner table on the street was nostalgic and a great experience for tourist
