Hidden gem. Probably one of the best croissant in Singapore. Pedro the owner and baker puts a lot of care and only uses ingredients he import from France.

All that needs to be said have been so eloquently describe by the other reviewers. Again, it is not cheap but it is quality stuff and fresh. This place is a gem

And also one of the best italien café with a very nice talk with the both. Just had the feeling to be in Italia !

The owner is very friendly and you must try their muesli bread with apricot and all their pastries with their coffee. Simply the best! You'll be coming back again and again!

This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a great place to chill! The coffee is really good and the owner personally makes sure of the quality of your service. Definitely worth a visit.

This little bakery cum cafeteria is located within the Burghley Tennis Centre. Our family comes over almost every weekend for an early breakfast when dropping off our son for his tennis lessons.Very simple setup that offers freshly baked pastries, bread, sandwiches and coffees for eat-ins or takeaways. The pastries are made by the owner and baked in the morning. They smell and taste heavenly, miles different from those store-bought ones that only serve to fill your stomach and nothing else. Coffee is freshly brewed too and has excellent aroma. I love the sandwiches - the ham and cheese is made of Parma ham, buffalo cheese and the reddest, sweetest slices of tomato with balsamic vinegar cream wrapped in focaccia bread. Croissants are warm, crispy on the outside, and buttery soft inside. Yum!A bit expensive though, sandwiches cost $11 up, so breakfast with coffee will set you back by at least $15 per person. Need to wait for service too due to shortage of staff. Most times, the owner is left to fend for himself alone without any helpers and it gets really crowded on weekend mornings with a steady stream of customers ordering dine-in and takeaways

I do not understand how this can only have 3 reviews? Reasons Why I love Bread King:- Can't help but support my local businesses- Inarguably the best bread and pastries I have tasted in Singapore- Fresh, fresh, and did I say fresh??- Owner is an absolute sweetheart who loves what he does and shows total dedication to his business. He cares about his customers, and sees to it that everyone is happy with the food and service he provides.- He delivers. Literally, and metaphorically.I highly recommend everything he has got. It is not the cheapest place, but with the type of ingredients he uses, you can really taste the difference.P.s. Having read this over, it sounds like a review written by a die-hard fan, and I assure you I am. Being next door from my kid's school I don't mind over-dosing on top-notch bread and coffee to pass the time

Friendly out of the way cafÃ© and bakery. Specialises in French style bread and pastry. Sandwiches are great. Not cheap but good quality. Good place to visit if you are in the area. Opens early to lunchtime and again in the evening closed in the middle of the afternoon
