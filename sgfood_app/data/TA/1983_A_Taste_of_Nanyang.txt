This cafe is always th one I will choose when I visit warehouse at joo koon. Good food, nice drinks and reasonable price. Portion of food is great and worth it.

Came here for lunch and had their signature dish, food was well cooked and presented, place was empty and little atmosphere

We chose this for dinner last night as we werent too hungry and dancied something light. There are lots of food options however it is all fast food.The dishes lack flavour. I had a roast chicken with rice and my husband ordered thai chicken. Both chickens were almost identical excpt for the sauce they were in. Portions are small so if you are not petite in size, get a few dishes. Thats even when they give you th chicken soup as part of the meal deal because its not going to fill you up.I wouldnt mind coming for a snack if I was in a rush, but would try something else before considering to come especially back to here

A set of chicken rice without drink close to $10 mark. U can't win because it's @ marina sands.After ordering my plate of set chicken rice. It's becoming jammed packed. Wow ....From 2 Q to place orders to more than 20. Am I lucky ? Must admit, it's not bad but not the best.Why ? The Chilli was a let down. Flop. Ginger comes with it was watery. There's more liquid/water than ginger itself.A total disappointment.Chicken was not bad. Sadly, I won't be back again

I was there for Ramadan Iftar on 17 June 2017, the man who served me and was managing the food was very rude and brushed me off when I asked for additional gravy to my dish. He spoke in a very brash manner. Not only is the service bad, the food is bad as well. I will not recommend it to anyone, Muslims or non-Muslims.

This food court served halal local food. I tried the chicken rice and it tastes quite good but pricey! It costs about 8 SGD if I'm not mistaken but the portion is generous. So if you look for halal local food in MBS, just go to this place but the price is quite expensive

Many egg shell in scramble eyes. Beef randang taste is one of the worst I've eaten in Singapore. Honestly food is below average, chicken seems to be fried many times and was served cold, the coconut rice is tasteless. I came here bcos I see this shop always filled with people. But I'm never coming back here again..

This restaurant was a life saver during my stay at MBS hotel - they served local halal foods!Don't get confuse with the real 1983 stall and the other stall. You should try the one at the entrance of the foodcourt! Their curry laksa and nasi lemak are nice. Plus, this is where you should order your drinks.Beware, the nasi padang/indonesian stall was not worth it. The foods were expensive (price is not fixed and the seller can just give price according to their mood). Last time I tried it, their foods were already cold and nothing taste special about them.The western section was just decent while the Chinese section was good too (I managed to try all stall during my 3 nights stay).Since it is MBS Shoppe, expect it to be clean, well maintained and comfortable (food court style comfort)

Traveling on budget cuts you off from quality food sometimes. But this restaurant is a quality + price wise. It's an upgrade from eating street foods but price isn't crazily outrageous. Also, since it is inside The Shoppes, it's absolutely clean. It's always full so sometimes, you have to share tables with other customers but that is just really fine. Staff aren't too friendly, but they are pretty quick and I like it. They aren't cheerful but they are focused enough to take your orders and not hurry you. So I highly recommend this restaurant to budget travelers

My wife and I were enjoying the Marina Bay Front and wanted to catch a quick, simple meal in the Galleria. We stumbled on Nanyang and decided to try the interesting local dishes. It's self service, fuss-free and self-seating. It was a Saturday night at 8:30pm but we got to share a table with 3 others. We ordered the Nasi Lemak and Gado Gado. The Nasi Lemak was fresh, fragrant and tasty but the Gado Gado was quite average. The Three Layer Tea and Soya Bean Herbal Jelly drink were refreshing and just right after an hour along the bay front. Worth another visit to try the many other dishes in that food court

I agree with the other reviews. This place is nothing special. ... apart from the fact that the price is reasonable....
It's got a few stores....most of them serving local food like chicken rice, nasi lemak, etc.... (I didn't know nanyang had nasi lemak?)

At last I found the place for Halal food. With several type of dishes, Malay, Pasta, Chinese or Thai. Clean restaurant with self-service way. The prices is a bit higher than the other mall.

found out from this blog, http://mikahaziq.blogspot.com/2012/11/marina-bay-sands-halal-food-court.html, about Halal-eatery in Marina Bay Sands area. Tried the Hainan chicken rice and laksa noodle. Taste fine, average but too simple in presentation, comparing to similar eatery with Halal-certification.

They have 4 option - Malay, Western, Chicken Rice and Thai. Loved the chicken rice. Surprised to see its not crowded on a Friday evening. Probably this is only place in Marina Bay Sands, where you can eat on Budget. Thought slightly more expensive than average food court price in Singapore, but it's considered cheap based on location. I would like to go there again and try the Thai stall..

The food is only average. But I'll go there again. Why? Because it is also the only place in Marina Bay Sands where the price is decent enough. So if I do go to this mall, this is the only one or two pieces I'll go if I don't feel like paying ridiculous prices for foo

Had lunch here as I have not tried much of a local food for the trip. I have had local street food at Lau Pat Sat before so this is really not too good when compared. The iced milk tea was also tasteless. Will probably pass next time unless I really am looking for something quick near Sands

Tried the fish cutlet with spaghetti from the western food stall. Freshly made upon order. Average food but higher price compared to other food court.Also ordered the satay set from the Malay food stall. The satay was fried instead of grilled and the sauce was cold. On top of that, the service staff was rude.Friends tried from the Thai stall, which they said it's not bad

Came here with a friend today in an effort to find somewhere slightly less crowded in the vicinity of the MBFC. Whilst this place isn't so busy, it is with good reason as the food is really nothing special and the prices are relatively high for what you actually get. I tried the Thai food outlet and chose a Pad Thai lunch set for $12. The noodles were oily, there were only 2 prawns, and the bean curd was chewy and unsatisfying. I won't be coming back here

Not sure if the eatery was new and going through teething problems, I marked a fail for this 'kiosk'.It had a very limited menu:3 Asian dishes, I ordered the longtong, it was not available. So I had the Mee siam - and thought that I had better elsewhere in the airport.It offered, I think, 3 drinks choices on the menu, a lady behind me ordered the 'ke dong dong juice' and was told it was not available.A customer who ordered an egg set, informed the server that her eggs were too underdone and requested for them to be a bit more cooked. The server was very flustered and insisted that they were most nutritious done that way. She exchanged them for 2 hardboiled eggs, giving the customer no choice.When I asked for a paper napkin, another server grudgingly handed 1 piece to me.In my 5 minutes there, it seemed to me that this place was not ready to operate, esp in Changi Airport

We passed by this place after our museum trip. Initially though it's just 1 store that's halal. Turns out there were a fewstores including chicken rice, western food, laksa,nasi padang and Thai. noticed there were set meals at the storee, some including drinks with their meal. An average cost of $10 per person for one meal. Bought the lemon chicken set meal which included rice, clear tomyum soup, choice of drink and dessert was steamed tapioca with coconut milk. Price was about $13. One of the decent Halal eatery which you can try if you are around the are
