The services is top quality plus the very tasty foods and good atmosphere. Our sitting could enjoy the Sentosa fireworks, no problem to recommend to anyone!
5
Staff are polite, attentive and efficient. Would visit again. On a side note, the view is great too.
4
Nicely done and a great addition to the Crystal Jade franchise. Delightful water view and food is pretty good.
5
the lady captain selected their signature dishes, amount were just nice, and venue was not crowded on a weekday. They surprise with complimentary desert.
4
Crab meat soup served hot - delicious. Sample some dim sum. Service was personal fast and attentive. Crowded during meal times. Good ambiance too.
5
Exemplary service, which is so important in this time where good food is a given and expected. This chain has lasted for & long time
5
This is my second time here and my first for dinner. Had tried their dim sum two years back.
The dishes were done excellently and service staff we great. Will visit again.

Went with family, we had the duck and it was well executed. It is always a delight to get what you want and pay for. Would certainly go back.
5
Arriving at 11.30am, our family was the second group in the restaurant for lunch. Soon after our arrival, the restaurant filled up steadily with customers, a testimony of the strong patronage it enjoys. We occupied a window table with unobstructed views of Sentosa.We ordered dim sum and individual dishes. The restaurant manager guided us through the menus and orders. He offered recommendations on seafood, meats and vegetables as well as to contrast and balance the cooking styles and tastes. He did a great job! For one dish, he noticed that the kitchen had served us a smaller portion than was ordered. He promptly alerted us and replaced the dish with a larger portion.The staff were attentive, changing soiled plates and bowls with clean ones as we progressed through lunch.We had a fantastic lunch and would recommend the restaurant without hesitation

Used to like the food at Crystal Jade. However, greatly disappointed with the recent 2 dinners here. The standard of the food has dropped tremendously, and the prices are exorbitant! Not value for money. The service was not attentive enough. We ordered 5 individual set menus. Instead of serving the food to us, the restaurant staff simply put them on the lazy susan. They could have noted which customer ordered which set and serve the food accordingly. This is mere common sense and a simple requirement expected from a fine dining restaurant
4
The food quality was high and the service staff was attentive and made recommendations of their choice dishes
5
I requested for a surprise for my wife's birthday dinner and yes, the restaurant manager remembered and surprised us with a free platter of fruits and some longevity buns. Good and friendly service experienced too.
5
The Service is Good, Food is Nice and value for money, our business partner happy with it and the location & Amenities Excellent. Thank you very much !

Ordered the set meal for 2. It was served individually. Charge is per head which makes it possible to top up for additional person. Portions served are minuscule but overall sufficient for a meal. Not particularly exciting. Tea ordered separately. Have a selection of different types of Chinese tea. I thought it was much better before. Quality of tea is below expectation. Overall, not good value for money considering price paid for it. One more thing - the membership is restrictive. I couldn’t get discounts nor clock points for set meal ordered which defeats the purpose of set meal - ease of ordering, in my opinion. Will definitely skip this for personal meals. Might have been better if i had stuck to the Dim sums.
3
Entered at 11am Saturday. Was told that we had to leave at 1230. 1 and a half hours to eat. Good view of the monorail into Sentosa. Very attentive staff. Non stop topping up of tea by staff. A bit pricier than other Crystal Jade branches. Don't order the lobster sliders shown. Could not decipher the lobster. Could have been tuna for all we know
5
• The Service very good.• Location good, near Sentosa and have MRT.• The Amenities/Place suitable for our discussion.• What i liked is the fast set-up for our last joined in guests for total 7pax instead of 4.Overall, Quality Food and Excellent Service
2
My Husband n I went to for a simple lunch for our wedding anniversary. We ordered Shrimp Fried Rice, Cheong Fun w Shrimp and Kang Kong with sambal paste. Food was generally good. It can quickly and hot.Service was efficient but warmth was missing. Before we could even order, they reminded us that we have only 45 mins to place the order and pressured us to quickly place the order. This is the first time I faced this and was rather stunned
4
We shared the clay pot seafood with bean curd with rice and the Hongkong Kailan (which I found a bit steep for SGD 17.80). Food arrived rather quickly and piping hot. It was enough for two people and really tasty. Service was great, efficient and very friendly! The only thing I don't like is when they put those nuts on your table without asking if you want them and then charge you SGD 4.- whether you eat them or not. But overall, very pleasant dining experience. Not the cheapest meal, but very enjoyable
3
Had a simple dinner with my mum. We ordered chicken soup, pork chop & scallop stir fry with vegetables.Service wasn’t great initially as servers are busy serving other guests. I have to ask for service twice before we are served with tea & menu. That said. The bad experience is short lived. The waitress noticed that we are neglected and quickly served. Food is traditional Cantonese food. Very tasty but felt really thirsty after the meal. Most likely the MSG is a lot in the food.
4
My colleague is in good mood as decided to have a good meal together. Happy to join in the lunch. We ordered a few dishes like fish, yam duck, toufu, 3 meat platter and vegetables.Service is excellent and food portion is just right. But price tag wise, considered expensive.Price: $$
4
We were lucky to be given a table with a view. Food was served pipping hot and service was adequate. A little pricey for dim sum but food was of good quality. Definitely will return for good quality food.
4
If the portion can be bigger for set meal, it will be better. Nice view and quiet place during weekday night
5
We enjoy dining at Crystal Jade Dining In because of the quality of services provided and the wide selection of choice from the menu. (both tim sum & ala carte).
4
Went down for dinner on National Day and food was delicious! Had the Kung Po Chicken with cashew and Braised Beancurd with mushroom. Both good, service also good, would come back for sure!
1
We ordered Chili crab..the meat was tasteless (crab supposed to taste sweet)..the sauce was overly sweet, don't taste the spicyness at all..the Hong Kong kailan with garlic was bitter..the meal was expensive..totally not worth it
5
service attendant is very attentive. the food prepared is also superb. the table we got is outstanding where it faces the sea side, good view!
5
Was here last weekend for birthday lunch. There are 4 type of menu available, ala cart, dim sum, individual sets and group sets meal for 4 paxs, 6 paxs and 10paxs.We ordered the group set meal, and top up with suckling pig and beijing duck. The suckling pig, beijing duck are really fresh. They cut it on the spot for you.Tried the quail meat here too. Overall family friendly restuarant which is not too pricy compared to the food provided
3
The food and service were average, but price was quite high. However the dim sum there was very good. So go for lunch, it was much more value for money.The lady at the reception was very good, she recognised frequent customers and always nice to us
4
Food was great and the service was almost personal. Even with the restaurant being really busy during lunch, we still "almost" had a service to ourselves, who was very attentive without being intrusive. Food could be a little pricey but well worth it. A great place for a casual lunch, meet-up with friends or even business lunch meeting
4
This restaurant never disappoints when it comes to serving authentic and yummy dim sum. Every single piece was well-made and I could see the effort placed in every single dish. The pan-fried carrot cake is a must try. The crispy on the outside but soft in the inside carrot cake just melts in your mouth. The service was very good too. I highly recommend this place if you are out to impress your guests.
1
Utterly disappointing. Poor service and salty, oily food. Staff appear not motivated at all and blatantly ignore patrons.
4
Service of staff was prompt and great. Great view as we had the view of Sentosa. Tim sum was great and we enjoyed it very much. The prices were slightly on the expensive side but i guess it's ok for special ocassions.
5
Excellent service received. A little pricey for 2 people but the food was great! Would visit again next time.
5
Booked a table for 10 for my family dinner. We had a quality spread of food, and the waitresses were very helpful (they helped my grandparents to cut up their food into manageable portions).
4
Can never go wrong with comfort food from crystal jade. Staff were way too attentive, topping up tea frequently.
5
Every time I think of dining at crystal jade restaurant, i will definitely choose the one located at Vivocity. The salted egg prawns are the best so far i have ever eaten. I am a huge fan of salted egg dishes, but most of the salted egg dishes served at chinese restaurants, it would be in liquid form, which i dislike. The salted egg prawns at Cystal Jade is done excellent! The prawns and yam are coated with thick layers of dried salted egg which is so yummy
4
As soon as I stepped into the restaurant I was greeted by the numerous staff around. I was seated in an area with a nice view of the sea. The staff was super attentive and helped to refill the tea. I wonder how many dim sum restaurants still had such wonderful services.
5
The food was delicious and yummy and our overseas guests enjoy it. They were also able to provide us with a table beside the window based on the remarks I left behind during online reservation. Thank you for making our dining such an enjoyable one! Will definitely go back again
3
Went to dine at Crystal Jade at Vivocity. Ordered few dishes. Some were alright. But a couple of dishes are salty and oily. The steamed pork rib is very oily and salty, deep fried bean curd skin roll ooze out oil and the noodle is salty. The black pepper beef is good and the garlic fry vegetables is fine. Service is good and server offered to change the salty and oily dishes but we declined.
4
Consistent service and good quality of food. Always nice to be back. Service can be a bit pushy sometimes but just tell them to calm down if that's more comfortable for you. But generally good. Must try the sea bass fried with long beans and peking duck pancakes. Dessert menu is a little disappointing but overall food menu is substantial
4
regular customer of crystal jade.. they service quality food.. very attentive staff and very polite also..
5
nice food.. good ambience.. wait staff are very polite and attentive.. price is pretty reasonable...
4
I like the food and environment, service also not bad. Deserve for a second visit, good for family gathering as well
4
Food was great and variety plenty. The service was good though it could have been better. Aircon was slightly on the cold especially for seats under the vent.
4
Great Atmosphere and Service was good. A little pricey however food was worth it especially the ee mian. Thank you
5
Was looking for a suitable dinner venue with something on the menu for my toddler, and the lady who greeted us at the entrance told us it was possible for them to cook a kid's share of Mee Sua soup with fish slices for my daughter! The staff were very friendly and accommodating, they even provided a pair of scissors for me to cut the meesua up because I forgot to bring mine! We ordered a fried rice with crabmeat and egg white, and a claypot with scallops, prawns, squid and tofu and the dishes were deliciously prepared. The view was also fantastic. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience here. :
5
We've eaten at Crystal Jade often enough, but this branch seemed to be nicer than others.The Good:1. Friendly, attentive, prompt service (though we were only 1 of 3 groups dining at that time).2. Excellent food and serving size. The food was so good and we were so hungry that I didn't have much of a chance to take pictures of all that we ordered.3. Nice, bright, warm ambiance.4. Good view of Sentosa.The Not-so-good:1. Was quite surprised with the bill ... mainly the steamed fish itself cost us $90 and it wasn't such a large fish either. A simple, standard dish of stir-fry Broccoli cost us $20, and it tasted ok, not great
4
We went to Vivocity for the usual shopping day out at this very busy shopping centre in Singapore and, come lunchtime, decided to have "Yum Cha" for lunch. The "Crystal Jade Dining IN" looked suitable so we asked for a table for four and were seated near the window. The view, overlooking the water and Sentosa island, was great. The service was great and the "dim sum", misallaneous servings of delicacies, was even better. Although a little pricey, it was worth the money to have an enjoyable lunch and we made a return visit with friends a few days later. But a word of warning, there is another restaurant with a similar name on the same 1st floor at Vivocity called "Crystal Jade Jiang Nan"
4
The thing about the Crystal Jade chain of restaurants is that you can always count on them to be consistent. They may not serve the most refined dim sum but they're definitely above average. We ordered the usual here and everything came promptly. Tea was topped up regularly and the view, overlooking sentosa, should have been impressive (unfortunately, on the day we were there, we were blocked by a frigate, as the navy was having some sort of open house). Good food, decent service, great view and relatively easy on the wallet, what's not to like about this place
5
We were a group of 10 and had one of their private dining rooms, great view but unfortunately we were too late for the daily firework....We were invited and the host got a variation of the restaurants best food, starting with Peking Duck, then scallops with asparagus, then one of the best razor shell clams I had, deep fried fish and steamed fishfollowed by a fantastic Singapore Chili Crab...and a nice dessertThe service was very attentive and made sure we are all well looked after.The food....was great, lovely flavors, well prepared, tender fish with crispy skin, the razor shell clam barely cooked, but absolutely amazin
4
A nice restaurant right on the waterfront in Vivo City, service is quick, meals reasonably priced as are the drinks (for Singapore)
4
Me and my wife had a chance to dine in here for dinner. The staff are helpful and friendly, even thought everyone looks very busy. Food is good.
3
the food looked fantastic, but every dish except for the spicy szechuan noodle dish tasted sweet! it reminded me of food in usa.
service however was impeccable. you must check out the great kitsch decor, good photo oppotunity!

Always a Favourite spot for my friends and I for our Dim Sum fix. We would always head on to Crystal Jade in Great World City.There is a good spread for you to choose from and the newly renovated restaurant is also a good place for business lunches. One of the acid test for any great Dim Sum is the "Har Kau" or prawn dumpling. The skin need to hold the prawns inside yet not be too thick to stifle the flavour of the prawns wrapped inside. If you're a Dim Sum lover, this place would not disappoint
5
have been to this restaurant twice and have not been disappointed. I was their for dim sum lunch the first time and was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. And did not hesitate when someone asked me to go their again for dinner another time. Enjoyed a very delicious and wonderful meal.. and everyone left feeling very satisfied. Will certainly visit this restaurant for the third time and beyond
1
We were at 9 pm20 and the waitress had just told me that the last order was at 9.30pm.Even though, as we decided to have dinner she first refused: too late! We pointed out this incoherence. Then we were accepted and they did their best to push us out: asking us to leave at 10pm whatever , all the dishes we wanted were unavailable and at the end there were only samples in the plates.So we decided to go and don t knowing that we were understanding, waiter and waitress were openly lauhing at us. The restaurant wants to be upscale but obviously it ignores upscale rules. I don t recommend it at all
5
We went to Crystal Jade in Vivo City to celebrate my birthday and farewell lunch for our Australian visitor . We had to wait about 30mins but got a window table facing the waterfront . Service was excellent the food was served on time and well presented. We took our own wine and paid a corkage fee of $10. Overall very good and upmarket food and highly recommend for any special occasio

Crystal Jade is a good chain in Singapore with multiple outlets all generally offering similar menus. We ate at the Vivo City branch which offers good dim sum in a nice environment. As the title suggests, the restaurant continues to sell sharks fin so some visitors may wish to avoid out of principal. The venue is located in the Vivo city shopping mall at Harbourfront. It is on the ground floor with a floor to ceiling glass view of Resorts World Sentosa. This is one of the best aspects of this restaurant as you can dine by the water and if at the right time take in the Dancing Cranes show at RWS.Food wise - always consistent Dim Sum although the xiao long bao are less delicate than Din Tai Fun - more meaty which is good. The crispy pork belly is also worth a taste as this is similarly consistently good. Each dim sum dish comes with typically 3 or 4 pieces at a cost of 4-5 SGD per dish. Service is always friendly, efficient and good. We have never been kept waiting for a table, food or a drink - this is after all a franchise that needs to turn as many covers as possible.Worth a visit - definitely if you are in Vivo or around one of their other outlets. Best dim sum in town - no but then this is clearly reflected in the value for money
5
I feel that any restaurant that is crowded and/or you have to wait to get a seat- must have good food. Crystal Jade upholds this belief. The food quality is good, the quantity is good.Their Dan Dan mian is really excellent. The dimsums are really good as well.The staff are friendly and the food does not take long to get to your table.Lunch time and weekends you may have to wait for 20 min. or so to get a table, but it is well worth the wait
2
Came with family of five to celebrate mother's day for my elderly mum & my wife but staff spoilt our dining experience. We ordered 12 dishes & they were all impeccably cooked. Superb chefs & kitchen staff, kudos to them for such excellent culinary skills. However, the waiting staff gave us hell instead of haven with her cold & blatantly rude attitude & sarcastic responds & always wanting to pick a fight. We felt so embarassed to bring our mum to celebrate in Crystal Jade, we could have gone to Tung Luk or Peach Garden to avoid such rude waitress. Mum was very sad & so was my wife too. Would we dare to return again to patronise Crystal Jade, i hope management get to read this feedback of their staff behaving in such uncalled for manner? We have lost our confidence & trust on the branding to continue our loyal support over all these 15 long years
4
Especially recommend their daily double boiled soup that is so tasty and no taste of MSG. Dimsum is good too. Overall nice ambience & view.
4
Seven of us visited this great place for dinner one night. We shared a whole lot of dishes and came away very satisfied.
5
Dim sum here is quite traditional cantonese style. Cha shao bao and beef hor fun is very good. Steam pork rib with yam and steam carrot cake are unique. Services is always perfect.
4
Was there for lunch with some business associates. Service is good and staff are friendly. The tim sum is nice and I especially like the fried carrot cake with XO sauce. The daily soup is well boiled and you can taste the full flavour. Tried various Crystal Jade Restuarant and so far, they never fail me
4
When shopping at Vivo City Singapore well had lunch at the Crystal Jade. What a great experience, the food was (to my western palate) authentic chinese, the service was excellent, the restaurant was well set out and the meal was great value. My grandson had a iced chocolate which was served with dry ice which added a bit of
4
It is difficult to get a last minutes table during weekend but Crystal Jade Dining In never disappointed us. Great dim sum and the price is reasonable. They serve peking ducks too. Service is good and attentive. The view is nice too (if you sitting near the window table).Overall, this is a good place for dim sum
4
Went here for a business dinner. Our table was beside the glass , facing the street & water. When it became darker outside, you can see the lights of Sentosa so it was overall a nice sight. We ordered some Chinese staples and the food was good. Also tried some of their rice cake/mochi dessert and the custard with salted egg which was different but good. Our partner told the server that the food had to be served quickly as we had another engagement after. Waiters were quick and efficient. Overall, it was a good experience
5
I went there 3 times in a few days....I really reminded me the succulent authentic Chinese food I had in China. Choice is large, quality of ingredients, presentation and always great taste. Additionally the service is really good, helpful, efficient. Maybe a little cold in the restaurant, plan a jacket
3
came on Good Friday - yes, first mistake! We had a 13:30 sitting, which was on time. The dim sum menu had been significantly shortened with many classic dishes missing. We also ordered a la carte to make up for this with some noodle dishes. These were good, but very expensive and dinner for 6 of us (lunch actually) was $320! Now that's expensive for dim sum and there are better places. Service was patchy. Some staff were excellent and friendly. Others wanted the day off
4
Visited the outlet at Vivocity, enjoyed the very personalized and attentive service by a very good elderly lady server.Was recommended the braised lobster noodles ANC it's worth every dollar spent. Fresh and succulent lobster with very tasty superior stock. Had the spinach in superior soup as a side and it was crunchy yet not too raw.Would definitely dine there again
5
This is the place for good dim sum. Food is awesome and the restaurant offers a view overlooking the sea. Great for families especially during the weekends. A bit more expensive but definitely worth the price!
5
The restaurant serves premium food. It is a prestigious place to dine in. So, make your one in a life time moment in this restaurant. You will be delighted that you've done it.
4
I agree with other reviews. Great waterfront view of Sentosa Island, very good food. However, service needs attention. Prices are on the high side, so not good value for money. Great for a tourist visiting one time.
2
The food is not very authentic and much like a fast food restaurant. Our bill included a charge for napkins, the 'complimentary' peanuts ($6) and tap water. Overall, quite a disappointing experience.
5
There are many different types of "Chinese" food. If like us you prefer the Hong Kong style, then this may be the place for you. Great crispy duck, roast pork, steamed garoupa, crispy noodles, prawns in thousand island dressing ( yes, sounds awful, but tastes fab!)The restaurant is a bit like the Doctor's tardis. A small unassuming entrance opens out into a wonderful and resplendent restaurant with sea views over Sentosa. Highly recommended, a little pricier than most, but most excellent food!
4
Excellent place for Chinese dishes - little expensive but worth the food. The quantity is quiet good and one bowl of fried rice is sufficient for 2 people to eat. The taste is really good. Service was great - well taken care of and the ambience is fantastic. Good seats are with the view of the harbour
5
I was invited by colleagues for lunch to this restaurant and everything we ordered was very tasty. The waiter was very attentive and gave very good service. I don't know about the cost since that was handled by others. The restaurant also has a very good view of the harbour towards Sentosa
5
We have never been to dinner in this place but we have dim sum a few times. Dim Sums are very good. The staff are helpful and friendly but it seems that they are extremely busy.If you eat near the windows, you can see the sea and Sentosa. A lovely place for lunch

Was here with my parents last Friday (14th June) for lunch. Was thinking of treating my parents to Chinese fine dining for Father's Day. Ordered the set menu ($48++) for each of us, and added on a platter of roast pork. Foodwise, it was good, especially the roast pork, was just the right amount of juice and the skin was crackling. However, the ambience was definitely not fine dining, in the sense that it was very crowded and noisy during a Friday lunch time, and there were so many diners who came in t-shirts, bermudas and flip flops. We could hear the conversations going on at the neighbouring tables (tables were placed rather near to each other). Next, they served 2 courses at each time, which made me rather shocked, as I believe courses should be served one at a time? After all, by the time we were done with one of the courses, the other would have been cold. Tea refills by the staff were also done half-heartedly, teapot positioned over my father's plate and tea dripping onto his plate down the side of the teapot.All in all, the bill for the 3 of us came up to about $200. With such a price tag, I expected more of the service standards. After all, with what I paid we could have enjoyed better service elsewhere. I can't help but feel that the views of the water that the restaurant enjoys have made the management rather arrogant, that even with bad service people would still be willing to pay the price for the view. To me, it's nothing more than a Chinese dim sum restaurant with a view (which many restaurants along the same stretch also offer) that is overpriced. Come here if you would like to have dim sum with the kids or a whole bunch of friends but avoid if you are looking for a quiet fine dining lunch with the special someone or to impress the parents (or in-laws)

Went to Crystal Jade Dining In in Vivo again after visiting in July last year. The food is still excellent and of high quality. XLB was excellent, some of the best in the city in terms of quality but terrible value (almost $2 each!). Congee, Roasted Pork Belly, Steamed Pork Bun - all very good.Generally I was not impressed with the service (rude and spilling tea all over the table), nor with their lack of Chinese Tea and Ice Coffee... (Jasmine Tea at $2/Pax)On top of everything, there was a seashell in the Radish Cake, very sharp and sizable...There are many places with better value in Singapore, I won't returning to this Crystal Jade location
