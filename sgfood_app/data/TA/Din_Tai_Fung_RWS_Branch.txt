We have many Chinese Restaurants in Australia and this restaurant was no better than our dumpling restaurants, maybe I was expecting more and it was a little expensive.
3
Food was ok, pricy end. But worst part is the service from the floor staff... not smiling. Unfriendly and kinda rude. Should improve on that!
4
Food as brilliant as ever... BUT the drink prices were extortionate.. $12SGD/AUD for a beer - OMG - event he water was ridic. Lucky we love the food so much - just waited to get a water from 7/11 after dinner!!
4
Quick service and quality dumplings.
Easy to step out of the park and get lunch instead of the normal park fare
5
Been to Din Tai Fung in several cities and this restaurant in Sentosa is equally delicious. Expertly and freshly prepared food brought to our table in a very reasonable time considering how very busy it was.
3
The waitress was snobbish. Food arrived very late... food quality was good though. On the pricey end. No wifi available.
5
Best soup dumplings outside of shanghai, great food all round. Beer is a bit pricey at $14 fir a small tiger but food is worth it.
5
The Dumplings her are really tasty , especially prawn and chicken and even the truffle buns. Even noodle soup is tasty. Even the Roselle drink is lovely, i drank 2 of them. Must visit.
5
The atmosphere was nice and quiet. The staff were very accommodating. We ordered soup dumplings (of course), dimsum, and their pasta with black bean sauce and mushrooms. The food was really good. Would definitely recommend it to my friends. The price was a bit more expensive than other branches tho
4
There was always long Q at every Branches of DTF, even though all outlets are big in space.But lucky enough, we Q for only ten minutes before a table was secured.We have to proceed to Universal Studios after the late lunch.The floor managers and those serving the food were very friendly.The speed of the serving of our food ordered was fine. We though that we would have to wait very long for the food.There are new cold drinks (red dates and longans) available at this Branch; and I enjoyed very much.We are not served with chinese tea from this Branch, compare to others outlets of theirs!The menu are rather the same as compared to all other DTF in Singapore.Could give it a try though!27/12/201

The best place to go is you want some Chinese food! Highly recommended and suitable for the young and old. I recommend their fried rice and noodle.
5
this is my first time try Din Tai Fung. good food! kids love the truffle buns, but its a bit pricy. But still good to have a try! recommend!
5
We went here for lunch and enjoyed the many varieties of dumplings, even the kids loved the food and can't stop talking about it. Very well priced as well.

We had been wanting to eat at the dumplings place all week and we finally did on our last day of our trip. The restaurant boasts ''world famous dumplings'' but I have to say, I have had better dumplings in Chinatown in Melbourne (Shanghai dumplings - check it out when in Melbourne).We ordered a plate of prawn/pork wontons - these were so good. They came in a chicken broth and were just delicious. We ordered 3 steamed pork and veg buns, but like all streamed buns, they were very glutinous. Lastly we ordered the famous pork dumplings. They dough was very thin and was full of juice, while the pork portion was not much at all. The parcels were like deflated mini water balloons. I would not eat there again. The prices were reasonable being a restaurant on Sentosa, but when it came time to pay the bill, they gave me the choice of paying in AUD, which was great as I was paying on the credit card. However, without me realizing it, the bill was S$32.70 and they charged me AUD$32.68. So it wasn't converted it over, so that meal actually cost me more as the dollar conversion was $1.05. The meal should have been $31.15AUD. So that was a bit crap. The best tip would be, pay in SGD as they rip you off with their own personal currency conversion
5
This is a great branch of this Taiwanese chain of dumpling restaurants. I loved everything I ate. The service is professional and the food is all made to order. Naturally dumplings of all forms are the great dishes, but do try the amazingly good fried rice.Don't miss it!
5
~my 2 boys always love a meal at Din Tai Fung and this Sentosa outing just before the March school holidays gave them a reason to drop in the RWS branch after closing at USSeverything we ordered is as flawless as it's always been at other branches and we had a great time getting in at 7.15pm without a queue on Fridaythe service was especially fast and attentive at this hour
5
We never tire of eating at the various Din Tai Fung outlets in Singapore. This restaurant was packed, but thankfully we only waited 3 minutes for a table.We particularly enjoy the fact that they always provide consistently good quality Chinese cuisine at decent prices.For appetizers, we always enjoy their oriental salad and beancurd cubes with honey sauce.We ordered their steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao) with their signature exquisite 18 fold. These little pockets of succulent goodness are always appreciated.Of filling and hearty taste is their pork chop paired with either fried rice or noodle soup. They go well with their chilli oil.We also tried their crispy golden prawn pancake, which is very tasty and vanished into our tummies quickly.A pot of Chinese tea is at SGD6.We paid SGD146 for the 5 of us, with some leftovers for takeaway.Their service is really efficient. Despite being hectic, the servers are generally friendly.The fact that they weigh the individual portions of their oriental salad and shape them into a conical design, attest to their delivery of dishes, with an unwavering quality and steady standard.Highly recommended for superb quality Chinese food at affordable prices

I've been to almost all of the Din Tai Fungs around the world. This particular branch however disappointed a little. I've travelled to many oceanariums around the world but this is by far the most interesting and innovative aquarium. PriceIf I remembered correctly, the prices here are slightly above average than the other DTF restaurant you would find in the heartlands. But the price was still reasonable. Around $12-13 for a plate of fried rice. Customer ServiceThe customer service here is good, DTF-style, just like the rest of the outlets where the service staff are attentive and courteous.FoodThis is the part where I am disappointed in. The taste of the food is meh, not sure if they have appropriated the taste for the tourists. I ordered Fried Rice with Pork Chop. The fried rice was slightly bland than the other outlets I've been to, and the pork chop disappointingly tasteless and hard. I have also noticed they have included a few Asian beverages such as iced green tea not normally sold in other DTF outlets, and they were very overpriced. A tip for diners would be to just order tea which is more worth it. If not, if you really want to try some Asian beverages, a nearby 7-11 store I believe on the same floor would sell a wider range at lower prices
5
My family have visited several Din Tai Fung in Singapore and found this one has the best ambience. Great food and service as usual. My kids usually love western food but really like their Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry, Xiao Long Bao and Egg Fried Rice
4
LOCATION: superconvenient for people coming to Sentosa for the US, SEA Aquarium and the other tourists' attractions. We always decided not to eat inside the attractions' areas for food quality and price and, by only stepping out, we found definitely better options!FACILITIES: kind on a small scale, so get ready to wait for a while. The second time we went there at 5.30pm and it was like a breeze. The first time we hit there 6.30pm....not the same kind of breeze. We had to wait 30+ minutes to get in and then other 15 to see some food coming. Waiters are nice but they are DEFINITELY in a hurry!FOOD: honest and safe food. Xiao Long Bao are a must of course!To sum up: Ding Tai Fung it's somehow what I would call a 'certainty'. When you don't know where to go, you don't feel that 'experiment' urge and you see a DTF around you....go there
4
Their Xiao long bao are the best in Singapore. The standards has never dropped and is a must try as it's always hand made! Be sure to try out the Dan Dan noodles and pork chop fried rice!
4
Seriously no diff from other DTF outlets, except this one comes with a Sentosa premium and likely flooded with winning and losing gamblers.
Nice ambience to dine at, until the PRC diners 'attack' the dining hall with their loud voices.
Beware.
4
Great quailty dim sum served in family friendly restaurant. Had a great family lunch there. Kids liked to watch chefs at work in kitchen.
3
Lots of varieties from their signature steamed pork dumplings to sauteed vegetables and steamed buns. Order one or two rice or noodle dish with one or two dumpling dishes.
3
I didn't see what all the fuss about this place was. They claim to have the best bao in town. It was good no doubt, but the other food wasn't as outstanding as people claim it to be.
5
I really liked, and many local people eat there. We even have to wait some minutes but they manage to find place very fast.
5
Avoid experimenting here, ask before you order coz there is so much more that showmen and fried rice in this world..
5
I had a quick transit stop in SingaporeAnd spent the afternoon at universalStudios This place is right by the entrance. I love being ableTo watch the chefs at workAt the amazing skill of making the many types of dumplings on offer as well as other dishes. Very professional, hygenic and efficient. You get an ordering sheet toChoose from one to ten of any of the dumplings so it'sGreat to be able to try many different types! I had a $5 porkAnd truffle Dumpling which was awesome. As wellAs allMy other choices. Definitely recommend finding this place on Sentosa Island
4
Din Tai Fung is a must do in Singapore. The food is excellent and it's not that expensive. The RWS branch is slightly more expensive because of the location and the menu is slightly different. Even so it that's the only chance to go to DTF you should do it! You can also get stamped out of Universal have lunch and go back. It's a much nicer lunch than what's inside
4
Honestly, we've been to so many branches of Din Tai Fung and they really don't disappoint. We came here between the lunch/dinner crowd so we were seated straight away and our food did not take long. The food was excellent, as it usually is. We ordered three orders of xiaolong bao and two spicy beef noodle soups.My only comment, and it's really not a complaint, is that they did not offer a bin to hold my purse and bags
5
Dim sum are tasty. But the price is little bit expensive. You can eat better dim sum downtown.
However, this restaurant is a good place to eat if you spend your day in Sentosa.
5
I love the food at DTF! if you're a tourist in asia and you've never had dim sum...I mean real dim sum then get your self to DTF
4
Food is good but pricier than same food served at other outlets of this chained restaurant over on the mainland Singapore.
Service is also slow during dinner time.
4
This restaurant have few brunch in Singapore and Malaysia. A very nice restaurant with very nice presentation of food. I like the xiaolong bao ! ^.^
4
This is a nice place to try dim sum they have wonderful selection of dishes to choose from.. Service was fast and friendly. The Place is clean and well taken care of.
1
Four of us visited for lunch @ DTF Sentosa and of course had a range of dim sum and yes it was extremely tasty as it always is. Fortunately for the one person in our group who does not eat seafood...they avoided mega food poisoning. The other 3 of us ALL had extreme food poisoning to the point where my wife and I had to make a hospital call in the early hours of the night for treatment and medicine. I have since eaten at this chain in Melbourne without problems however on a recent trip to Singapore we tried the DTF at Marina Bay Sands (and waited for 1 hour for a table for 5-6...despite people coming after us and getting in earlier due to either smaller or bigger group size - that hurts, watching patrons arrive and walk in after we have been waiting 30,40, 50 mins etc) plus by the time we got in we were told we could not order anymore as the place was shutting and the bill was rudely forced upon us after we were still eating. Note to management: Consider flexible table sizes that can be slotted next to each other and separated based on group size. (i.e. 3 x tables for 2 can easily be positioned to seat 6 instead of allowing 3 other couples in before the group of 6 waiting for "a table for 6").Anyway, the one person in our group who had seafood dim sum got food poisoning! So my DTF days are now over and I suggest tread with caution with the seafood options, however as it is in the Casino, you may like to gamble
5
Visit here after spending a day in Sentosa. The name is well-known in Singapore so I had to wait for table arrangement and chose food during that time. The dim sum was as good as people told me. The beef noodle was very tasty however the dried noodle wasn't. Must try
1
I was rushing to go a movie gala, step in the restaurant at 5pm, ordered food. Prawn dumplings and my fren's pork chop noodle has came, but I waited for my pork meat rice dumpling for an hour. 6pm they served and I have to rush eating it.The last time I had fried rice and ramen in another branch it was no good. This time around my friend want to eat this so I leave no choice.Instead of xiao long bao, I thought I should give it a try of their steam prawn dumplings. Thick hard wrap and pathetic amount of meat inside. Paying $7.50 for a pork rice dumpling, it is so small and only pork inside nothing else. Rice is soft, after waited for an hour $7.50 a dumpling from a Taiwanese restaurant there's nothing inside. Very disappointed and not going there to eat anymore. In fact all branches in Singapore.
3
This restaurant is extremely busy, especially at dinner time. The wait wasn't too long for a table: we arrived at 6PM and was seated in 10 minutes. The service could be improved though: we were seated towards the back of the restaurant and it would take a while for anyone to acknowledge us. We didn't have a designated server: they seemed to just run around all over the place. The food was good, though they didn't have some of our favorites (not sure if they were sold out as they were crossed out on the menu). Because of the poor service, we likely won't be going back...there are plenty of other restaurants in the area
5
A chain it may be, but the made to order nature of the place, paired with its attention to quality and detail make DTF a regular stop for many Singaporeans (and us expats). The Xiao Long Bao are great, particularly aim for the pork parcels with shrimps balanced on top. And whilst the fried wantons aren't necessarily anything special, they're still some of my favourites
4
A reliable performer... of food quality, flavour and table service..notwithstanding the outlet in this eatery franchise. Not fine dining by any measure, but casual meals of premium quality..apparently, freshly cooked to order. Try the noodles, fried rice or the steamed delights..and enjoy..Definitely, recommended..
4
No matter which outlet or country, taste and service are consistent and reliable.
A great place to bring tourists for a first time meal. Not spicy and very tasteful.
4
The taste for food here is nice and taste, serve within 10 minutes time after took the order. Overall for the food presentation and taste is excellent with cleanliness.
3
Nice and spacious restaurant. Really excellent dumplings. We had the pork dumplings with black truffel - superb. Good noodles. Fast and good service.
3
Very busy, very loud, but quick, tasty food. Would go again and the non stop Jasmine tea was a welcome.
4
Had an early dinner here before we head back to hotel. For a quickie, we ordered some noodles & their signature dish Xiao Long Bao.
4
Food was great, came out fairly quickly, this restaurant was always busy so we had to see what all the hype was about! Dumplings were lovely!
4
We were told to try Din Tai Fung out before we left Australia, great food, ended up having dinner there 3 out of the 6 nights we stayed in Singapore. Service was good and pricing was good. The pork dumpling were great and would suggest the egg fried rice with the pork cutlet
5
We traveled to Singapore solely to have these dumplings for my husband's birthday. Although we had many other dishes the dumplings remain the stand out food. it is interesting to watch them make them through the windows and each one is perfectly crafted by hand. They have a delicious mouthful of broth in each one and are perfectly matched with the fresh ginger and a mix of soy and vinegar.They are very reasonably priced and were the highlight of my day! Might have been cheaper to fly to Sydney to have them as they have opened a branch there, but not nearly as much fun
3
Food is average but overcrowded n overprice. If you been to China, this is nothing. Guarantee. If you never try before, can do so, but not in sentosa cos the place is always pack with people. Better to take McDonald especially need of time to enjoy.
5
open kitchen, good value for money, great pork dumplings, spicy noddles are a musty try. gets very busy and waiting times can be tiring.
5
Best dumpling place in Sentosa, you can also find it's branch in Singapore. All equally good. Besides dumpling, they also serve great fried rice and fried noodle.
3
The food is very expensive, considering the portion is very very small.
The taste is not as nice if compare to Malaysia Din Tai Fung, disappointed.
3
The food was quite enjoyable, not brilliant but quite nice. The service was good and I would probably go there again in preference to other places around that area.I had takeaway from there the night before and it (soup) was very nice. Just what I needed for takeaway
5
Place was bustling with people and the wait for a table could get incredibly long. However, the food and service when you are in the restaurant makes up for the long waiting time. Try to visit during off peak hours, like non-meal times for some snacks and you wouldn't have to wait for so long
4
After a visit to the SEA aquarium we called in and ordered quite a selection of dishes.All were delivered with an explanation and were very tasty and very good value. We paid 140 dollars for a selection for four people and took easily one third home as we could not eat it all. Very good valueThis restaurant did its job in providing tasty food quickly after an amazing day's visit to the aquariu
4
One of the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore! quite expensive but it's all worth it..from soup to main course you will love it for sure..the ambiance perfect for all,not that noisy the staff hmm kinda rugged,maybe because of the long queue.Well I don't mind that kind of personality what important to me is the food that I want to eat and the ambiance your paying for.
5
Want fresh from the kitchen, dim sums with perfect flavour and texture, melting in your mouth - Think Din Tai Fung. The average wait of 25 minutes is worth every second. The food here is delicious, even for vegetarians. The restaurant staff is helpful and extremely hospitable. The restaurant is clean and well lit
2
The staff there were not attentive. the staff also choose to attent to customers by their appearance as in what the customers are wearing. For those customers that were using branded good got attended first and those whom dress as a average person were attended last. Shouldn't it be first come first serve? The food that were served was cold as it has put at the waiting area for awhil
5
2 of us ordered 20 of their famous dumplings, an appetizer, a bowl of noodles and a shrimp fried rice. During peak dinner hour, we waited 5 mins to be seated(more people might need to wait longer, 2 of us is a lot easier), 10mins serving our dumplings and another 10mins to serve all other dishes. Food was good + fast and efficient service = happy customers. Tips - always get a running number to be seated before you enter the restaurant
4
Went there towards the end of evening dining and they'd run out of a couple of things we wanted but still put together a very tasty set of things. Loved the mustard salad and the chilli crab and pork buns
5
After 4 trips to Singapore I finally got to eat here . Why did I wait so long !! The flavour just keeps coming with every dish that comes out . Worth every cent.
5
I love the Bao's Here .. filled with greens
Chinese food is very authentic and yummy ....
Good range of vegetarian options here one can try...
Make sure to do reservation as it is always crowded and waiting upto 1-1.5 hours
5
I am not a fan of chinese foods but this food really made me want for more and more and more dimsums! The best dimsum I have tried so far:)
1
This place was not relaxing at all. Thu rushed you in. Rush you to order. Rush you out. They charged you for everything including water and napkins. Food was average at best. If you are looking for those wonderful dumplings there are better options in Singapore that offer better food, better service, and better price..
4
The main highlight of this restaurant is their steam dumplings (xiao long bao). It is a dish not to be missed. However, they do not take reservations and customers have to take a queue number and wait for their turns. Therefore it is best to be there slightly earlier than the usual lunch / dinner hours.
2
For the price of the food in this restaurant, you would expect something that might come close to leaving an impression. The flavours are ordinary. The presentation had no artistry. The service did not make you feel special. It felt like we were just one among the many eating there. And the waiter kept trying to sell us their special for the day when I already declined. It felt like I had to give a reason why I declined. Don't eat here unless you want to throw away your money to try it
4
We've visited Din Tai Fung quite a few times now, in Singapore and Sydney. The food is consistently good. The serving portions aren't large (more "dainty"), but tastes great. My favourites are the xiao-loong-bao, beancurd with pork floss and century egg. Wholesome tastes that remind me of my upbringing delivered in a place that has a pleasant ambience. I visited for Monday lunch which wasn't particularly busy but have been told there are typically queues
5
Just have to have it. A must when visiting Singapore. Pork and chicken dumplings, fried rice with egg, Oriental wontons in chili sauce, chicken wings, sliced duck...dou miao....bring it all on! Lots of good taste. Lemongrass juice, watermelon juice...ice tea....ahhh.....lovely!Personally I find the restaurants itself a bit "cold" - very bright light and noicy. However the food and drinks make up for it. Will be back
5
we had lunch twice at Din Tai Fung Branch during our stay in Singapore. Service may appear a bit shabby to "occidental standards" but the quality of food is exceptionnal and the overall experience just great. Dont leave Singapore without tasting their succulent dim sum !
4
Service was great. Ddin't wait long for seating and food. Though, it doesn't hurt for staff to greet you as they were quite robotic.:-)
4
My favorites are: Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing, Xiao Long Bao, Noodle with Minced Pork
in Bean Sauce, baby bok choy with garlic
4
good place to go with young children, the xiao long bao and fried rice were very good. my friend's battery ran flat and they are very helpful to charge for her.
5
Pricier than street food offerings, but, sometimes, at the end of a day's outing, you just want to sit down for them yummy Xiao Loong Bao!
Had always enjoyed meals at Din Tai Fung at other branches in the world!
5
delicious food and traditional dishes. Really great taste. very clean, big hall, friendly waiters. We had steam dumpling, soup and desserts and drinks. Price as Singaporean but great experience.
4
excellent service, lots of yummy food varieties, clean, calm and quiet, love;y interior. A good place for family or business lunch / dinner.
3
We had lunch here recently in between a visit to Universal Studios. Place was full so service was very slow. We ordered mostly dimsums intending to have a quick lunch. However, the xia long bao that we ordered took something like more than 30 minutes to arrive, while the rest of the dishaes came after around 20 minutes. The service staff seemed harried. We finished off our food quicky and got out right away. Suggest not to come here for lunch if one is in a hurry to go back tomthe theme park.
5
On our last visit to Singapore, we dined in the Resort World Sentosa Branch of this restaurant chain and we were very, very impressed with the Xiao Long Bao, so we decided to give it a review though it quite months ago and things may already changed...Ineed, we don't have any beautiful words to describe, but so far it is the best Xiao Long Bao we've ever had. And we definitely recommend for anyone to try this despite we may have to queue up over 30 mins or the service may very poor, according to recently reviews. However, The One Star Michelin awarded in 2009 and ranked among Worldâ€™s Top Ten Best Restaurants by The New York Times in 1993 for Din Tai Fung, they were all happened for a reason
5
we had dinner after visiting the Universal Studios. we're vegetariands and have been to other outlets in singapore many times hence ordering was easy. got the dim sums and a few greens but they missed out on the rice! had to remind them before that was brought. overall it was nice to eat at a din tai fung agai
4
On our last visit to Singapore we dined in The Paragon Branch of this restaurant chain and we were very impressed, so we decided to give this new outlet a go.Great Dumplings - Good Service - Nice LunchImprovement could be made in the timing of the delivery of dishes to the table - some dishes came out of sequence
5
Service with a smile, food outstanding, bill reasonable. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. Dumplings are to die for, the soups are great.
4
I think the standard and quality of food here is the same as all its other restaurants. Staff are well trained and although there is a queue, it is well organised and moves pretty fast.
4
The food here is always good. Ate here at least 4 times and each time the xiao long bao tastes as good. The lychee prawns are only available at this branch so make sure you try them.
5
Just great dumplings ! It really is that simple. We ordered way too much simply because we couldn't narrow our choices down anymore ! A must do if you're in Sentosa !
4
THe food here is good. The Xiao Long Bao (Steam pork dumpling) and the Fried prawn cakes, fried pock chops just take the cake. Highly recommend.
4
The food was delicious & fresh. The service was prompt & professional. Compared to other food outlets here, this is quite good value
5
Came here just to order TRUFFLE xiao long bao.the truffle was not generous, only 2 slices per xiao long bao, but you can just feel the difference.i don't have any words to describe this, but so far this is the best xiao long bao i've ever had.the ordinary xiao long bao is quite nice, but the truffle makes it differ.spend SGD$45 per 10 truffle xiao long bao. Came here 5 pax, ordered 80 Truffle xiao long bao.that's around 16 per person.the bill come $SGD 420. include drinks for 5.expensive, but this is worth every penny.one lack of this restaurant is that we must wait long time before we can get in.waiting time is around 30 minutes when it's empty, and can be 60 minutes if crowded like saturday and sunday
4
This is my second visit to this outlet since last year.We came at 7.30pm on a Tuesday and the queue was already a 30-minute wait. We were given a number and we joined the rest of the crowd waiting patiently outside the restaurant. Normally I would not want to queue to enter any restaurant but I have been dreaming of the signature xiao long bao for the past 7 months since my last visit, so what choice do I have?Around 30 minutes later, we were shown to our table, gave our order and in a few minutes, our much-longed-for baos appeared. And they did not disappoint. The skin was thin as usual, soup slurpy good and coupled with the thinly sliced ginger and vinegar, made the wait really worthwhile. So yummy. We also ordered the beef brisket noodles and the prawn fried rice. Both equally good. Service was quick and excellent. Overall very satisfied and looking forward to the next visit
4
I tried this restaurant in Kuala Lumpur last week and lo and behold, I found another Din Tai Fung just opposite where I was having a meeting! I went there with a colleague after this meeting and it had just gone 6pm but there were already crowds of people queueing! I'm generally not one to want to queue for any food and would rather go elsewhere rather than wait but seeing I had been to this franchise in KL, I had already started salivating and waited 45 minutes! Yes, I even amazed myself!The receptionist gave us a check-list but seeing I couldn't remember what all the dishes that I had before were, I needed to consult the menu with pictures!You can imagine my consternation when I couldn't find my favourite prawns in mayonaisse sauce!! But they had the drunken chicken and most of the other dishes including of course, their signature Siew loong Barl! They had a delightful fruit drink with a huge round iceberg in it! I think when I return here next and have this, I'll ask them to skip the iceberg as it took up a third of the glass!Despite not getting my prawns, the rest of the meal was excellent although it was a little slow arriving but this was no doubt because of the crowds there!It cost more than I would have expected, S$120 for two of us, but then we did have 12 dishes so perhaps we went overboard a bit but managed to finish most of it!I told my colleagues about this place and they said there's another branch in the building where our office is in Parkway Parade so I asked why we've never been there for lunch and, I should have guessed but they said because it's always so crowded at lunchtimes that most of our lunchbreak will be over just standing in the queue!So one thing I've learnt, all the dishes aren't available at all the restaurants but there's always plenty of other dishes that you will like so I haven't given up on these restaurants
4
We visited this outlet w a party of ten. We were made to wait for an hour, although we told the hostess that we do not mind being seated on different tables of whatever configuration as long as we can get food. After the long wait, she got us a table that was good for all of us. Food was good as always.
5
They have the best xiao long bao ever! We also tried the steamed pork dumplings - it was also good. Their jasmine tea is worth a try - plus it's refillable. Go there around 5pm to avoid long queues. It's just outside Universal Studios.
5
the egg fried rice here taste as good as the one in taiwan. xiao long bao too. taste similar to what we have in taiwan.
5
Simple, easy food that is always delicious - great for bringing a group to. There might be a line up but it's worth the wait. Make sure you order what you think you'll want beforehand and you can always add more once inside.
4
I cannot really complaint about the portion. The small size allow me to sample various variety, more like snacking. And the dumpling lives up to its reputation. Other item you must sample is the shrimp fried rice. Very good.
4
We beat the queues by getting in early. A great way to warm up for a bigger meal which was us. Invited two friends who all agreed the shao long bao was the best around. Very tasty fillings and oh so delicate pastry skin. They get a rubber wheel star for the food alone. Service is not a highlight but for the pricing I did not ever expect this to be feature. Enjoyed the bao and ignored the poor service
3
Had dinner at Din Tai Fung. Expected to eat some of the best Asian food on the planet based on the Michelin Star advertisement on the restaurant.When we sat down, we got handed an order sheet. A chef then came around and dumped the food on the table once cooked. Food was alright but not great.My best description, "Average Dumpling House
3
Well, the restaurant seems inviting and we saw lots of queue everynight waiting to be seated so we decided to give it a try on our last night in sentosa. We had to wait about 15minutes to be seated and the restaurant was almost closed (it's 9.30 pm) We were given the menu and half of the food we want to order was sold out so we ended up with nasi goreng and ice tea. Food was good but I wish they could make us more. But then we should've come ealier I guess
5
We ate here after a day at Universal Studios. The location is very convienent. The restaurant is huge but busy enough that there may be a wait. The food was delicious. My wife was apprehensive since she had never had dim sum before, but was delighted by the experience
3
We went to Din Tai Fung RWS Branch for lunch in February. There were 3 of us altogether. We ordered the famous siao long bao, wonton soup and Chinese vegetable dao miu. We went there about 2.30pm and the restaurant was almost empty. Even though there were only 2 other tables occupied, the service was slow. I had to ask for tea refill every time. There was no smile. On the plus side, the food was freshly prepared but the price was rather high.Will only go there as a last alternative next time

We went to Din Tai Fung during a lunch break from Universal Studios. It was over the Chinese New Year period which MIGHT account for the busyness and very poor service we encountered. Unfortunately this was the second poor experience we had with Din Tai Fung this trip. In summary:- when we arrived despite there only being a few people waiting we were told it would be a twenty to thirty minute wait for a table and the same again for food. However, at least we were told! - when we finally got a seat it was right next to the bar so zero ambience as staff were constantly collecting orders. I also notices that about half the tables were not being used despite it being lunch time. - we had ordered two juices, Mr PugHuggers arrived about five minutes after we were seated. Twenty minutes later after seeing multiple juices of the type I had ordered go to other tables we enquired about my order, clearly they had delivered it to someone else. It was delivered another ten minutes later with little apology.- when the dumplings finally arrived, although delicious, two stuck to the steamer (first time. We have experienced this despite five trips it Din Tai Fung) and the broth was lost.All in all, but for the food being delicious I would have given them a poor rating, the tasty food however saved the day although I'll approach this chain more cautiously in the future given two bad experiences in a row

I read and see lots of advertisement about this establishment, including the one with Tom Cruise. No wonder the price is quite high, given the portion of the food. The dumpling is quite delish, but it's not worth the price. Other items are just average.
3
There are other branches of this chain that had slightly better service. Though the food was OK, the service was slow and poor, we had to pay to for tap water! The lime drink was excellent especially if you’re thirsty.
3
Told that we have to wait for at least 20 mins even though there were plenty of empty tables inside. Some of our dishes came so late that we had to cancel them. Otherwise, food is good as usual.
4
What can I say..i guess DTF is one of the most successful franchise from Taiwan. Standard taste everywhere (which is quite tasty). but the portion is small compare to the price.
2
Food at Din Tai Fung, in my opinion, are always tasty. This particular branch is no different; except of course for:1. very slow service even when there are only three tables;2. most of the employees, I think, are from China? They do not seem to understand simple instructions in english. My daughter is bilingual so she spoke to both the waitresses in mandarin.3. ordered five main dishes and two starters; had to cancel one of each as the orders got mixed up! Had to cancelled because we waited 30 minutes and we had consumed most of dishes served.Lime juice still our favourite
2
Though the food was not too bad, the service was slow and poor. They have a queuing system that is completely messed up. Several tourists were stuck as most of the staff could not communicate in English. When customers left, the staff took a long time before they cleared the tables. Hence, the long waiting queue. Overall, food isn't too bad...but for the wait? No, I won't go back again
5
This is a chain of resturants, we ate in two resturants and we enjoyed them both. There are not many dishes for vegetarians . The fruit drinks are great. I lved the lime , but the other were very testy as well. The funny thing is that the bill is tiped only in chainees so you understend thow much to pay but not the items that you were charged for. The resturants are very clean and you may see how tey make the dim sum, nuddels etc through a large window. Enjoy
5
Although I went there on a Saturday night, I only waited about 20 minutes for my table. The service was fast and efficient and cost and quality of food remained as good as all the other Din Tai Fung branches. It was indeed a pleasant eating experience! Would recommend all tourist who loves chinese food to visit this restaurant.
3
I like Din Tai Fung generally but this branch .... is it my imagination or is the choice more limited than in other branches? Is it catering to the non-Chinese tourist crowd because of the location? The food was good, as ever, but the bill seemed quite steep for what we had
4
We went around 10am, not a lot of people then. Waitresses were adequately 'smiley' but I wouldn't say they were friendly. We ordered the food and it came pretty quickly. They do not come all at once. Prices are ok, tastes is excellant. Love their dumplings with 'soup' in them :)Nice place to come and have a meal. Order small dishes to share with everyone
3
Just don't go in with high expectations. Average dinner for 4 like many other Singapore restaurants will set you back $100 SGD. Still, I would recommend local hawker food over DTF.
5
Although crowded, dumplings were worth the wait. Made fresh to order and gets to your table hot and delicious; as it should!
3
Been some time since I last visited this outlet. Ordered the wanton noodle soup and of course, the xiao long bao. I find the soup base rather tasteless and blend. The noodles and wantons are good though. The xiao long bao is so-so only IMHO.
5
Do not miss this restaurant-there is at least one more site in Singapore that I have been to (Paragon Mall) and I just cannot get enough
5
A brilliant place we ordered lots of different foods then all shared them. You can mix & match with everything.
4
Its says on the side of the building that Din Tai Fung is one of the top 10 restaurants in the world, being a bit of a foodie, this definitely got my attention. My wife, 8 year old son and I decided to give it a try. We really enjoyed the meal and the service, it has the ambience of a good family restaurant and for not a lot of money. We shared 6 dishes, had a few drinks for a grand total of $70. Good value and good food, I don't know about the top 10 thing though.
4
This is the best dim sum we have had in our life so far (and we've had our fair share)! Love the dumplings (they hand make every single one of these!) and the drunken chicken was incredible. Pricey yes, but worth it. Service is a little slow so be patient and prepared. Don't go in starving, you may be waiting a bit
3
Lots of tables and spacious. But, for the takeaway service, what promised to be a 15-min wait turned out to be almost 45 mins. Luckily, the staff was willing to change my order of their specialty dumplings which had turned cold from waiting too long to a new piping hot serving
3
We love Din Tai Fung and had enjoyed the food and the service at branches in Shanghai and Hong Kong, so we looked forward to a treat at Din Tai Fung Sentosa. The food was still good, and the seasonal chili crab special xiao long bao was wonderful, and so were the crab buns.But the service at this outlet was nowhere near the excellence we had experienced elsewhere, which was surprising because this branch was also not as busy as when we visited the other branches. It took a long time for our food to be served, and even longer for the second round of orders that we asked for. So the service here was a big letdown from the usual DTF standards, so you might be better off getting your DTF xiao long bao experience elsewhere. Not sure how the Marina Bay Sands or Orchard Road branches compare
4
I have to admit that while I've known DTF to be hugely popular amongst locals, I've never understood why it's attracted such a following. Finally had the opportunity to sample the steamed dumplings for dinner last weekend. While the dumplings were freshly made (in as much as the kitchen had to keep up with non-stop orders) and tasty, I didn't find them that spectacular. I've had similar dumplings in other Chinese restaurants and couldn't sense much difference. So should it be that standards weren't as high as expected, or that other establishments had caught up?We ate early, so didn't have to wait more than 10-15 minutes to be seated. But by the time the sun had just set, the queues were ridiculously long. I could imagine that the staff, who had been friendly and attentive before, could by then have been pretty stressed out. In particular, those at the entrance handling new customers were calling out queue numbers like crazy. So go if you must, but anyone who goes early would be wise
5
There are a few Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore and they are great. You order by checking boxes on a menu (kind of like Yum Cha in Australia). The food is excellent.
3
Service is OK, efficient like other branches in the Singapore island. But the queue to get a table is super long, much longer than other Din Tai Fung outlets in Singapore.
3
The food is ok. But u need to queue up long time even U can see there are several empty table inside.
4
Good:
-Despite the madness inside, when you call the staff, they will 100% respond to you.
-Good quality food served to me.
-Short wait time for the food.
Bad:
-After registration, I had to wait for some time.
-Avoid peak hours.
-Expensive parking.
5
Let me first tell you a real fact. This restaurant is originaly owned by the Hong Kong people. THe food comes from Hong Kong. Dimsums, desserts...
4
Been to their rest several times and never dissapointed at their taste except last visit was on sunday afternoon and quite surprised with their queque. Had to wait for an hour b4 got seated. But as always their food are always great
2
Having visited last year we were eager to return. After a half hr wait outside where youfill in your menu requests, we were ushered to our table. Nobody welcomed us or said hello ( last yr we had a very friendly waiter) shortly the food starting arriving. Deposited on table by staff with earpiece , again no discussion. It was very impersonal and reminded me of a factory. The Xiao Long Bao were a bit bland, the soup inside tasteless. No ginger soy to accompany. For the money, there are better choices than this, where staff actually talk ( Imperial) & food is yummy. Go for the experience but the light from this star is fading

Went to Din Tai Fung at RWS (Sentosa) with my family, parents, sister and her toddler, totalling 8 people. There was no waiting staff at the entrance to assist guests who wish to dine and guests were generally left to wait in the sun for more than 5 minutes before someone has to enter the restaurant to ask for assistance, after which a waitress abruptly handed different sets of guests the single-paged order form and a pen to make our order, without offering us any menu to refer to. There was no apparent system of queuing either, as a group of guests who came later than us were attended to first. After a 15 minute wait, we were ushered to our table but to our surprise, we were given a 6-seater table rather than an 8-seater table even though there was an 8-seater table practically nest to our table. The waiting staff squeezed 2 additional seats at the head of the table which is absolutely ridiculous! And while business was rather brisk (it was a Friday afternoon), the 8-seater table had been empty the whole time we were having our lunch. We placed our orders immediately and ordered desserts too, but the serving staff did not appear to understand that desserts should be served after the meal, and not alongside with the appetizers before the mains are even served. Even our attempt to explain that did not appear to work as the waitress just looked at me blankly when I requested for the desserts to be served at the end of our meal. I spoke in perfect Mandarin to her so I am not sure how the message had not been communicated. Finally, the manager came about and helped us return the dessert, with the understanding that it should be served after our mains. For some reason, the main course my mother ordered was served very late, after a reminder when we had all practically finished our meal. There was no apology, although it had been apparent that the staff had made a mistake. The food was alright, but we thought the quality of food in some other outlets (such as the one at Wisma and Katong I12) was better. I am a great believer of service excellence and I will not be returning to this outlet owing to the poor service received from the staff here

YUM! Our family of 5 plus grandma had dinner here after a hard day at Universal Studios. It was great! Freshly made dumplings, fried rice (just the way the kids liked it), vegies and soups were what we tried and it was all delicious. We loved that you could see them making the dumplings and the service was fast and child friendly. It is a bit more expensive than local eateries or food courts on the mainland but I think it was worth paying more for quality food in a nice looking restaurant. I loved it.
4
We thought the queue will be long during dinner time but to our surprise not a lot people! We did not order their trademark Xiao long bao as we had tried it before. Thus we order the steamed cod fish which cost $21!!! Expensive but worth the money. Service wise ding tai feng standard is always good so nothing to complain about
4
The food taste great! It's Din Tai Fung! I love it. Their fried rice and xiao long bao... I can eat loads!
Cons: Long wait! What to do? You wan good xiao long bao, you have to wait.
4
A lot of people write about the chaos here. It will be chaotic, accept it, the food will come, and it will be delicious. Everyone has to wait for a table, inside is full of noise, hustle and bustle.
Great service, great food, affordable price.
5
great eating place. and the iced lemon tea is lovely. places all over Singapore but the one at resort world is huge. Be prepared to wait though as its very popular
4
ok, so this place always has a crowd of people outside waiting for a table...so it must be good?We waited 30 mins for a table & while you wait you can choose what you want to eat on the menu outside. You are then called to your table when it is ready.What I liked:Delicious freshly squeezed juices, but you can get these many placesEfficiency (but only when you're inside)Variety (even for a vegetarian like me)you can watch the chefs making the dumplings - amazing!What I didn't like:Wait for a tableA bit chaotic outside, luckily we had someone with us who knew the processno vegetarian dumplings - out of stock )-:inside is crowded & they have a section cordened off with empty tablesSo! if you have time & are not starving then go for it - it's well worth it because it is not expensive.Recomendation to the manager - serve drinks to people waiting outside & you may want to print the bill in english if you're situated in a tourist are
3
I was rather disappointed with the service. The restaurant was not crowded at 11.30am and we had to keep asking if our food is ready. We ordered 4 dishes and somehow the last dish was never served. When I asked for it for the third time, the waitress told me that my order is on the way. By then, my family has finished all the food and did not wish to spend more time waiting for a dish that is 'still on the way'. I requested to cancel it as we are excited to visit the new attractions in RWS. To my dismay, I was told that its impossible for me to cancel the dish. I told the waitress that I have asked for the last dish a few times. The waitress checked with her colleagues on her walkie talkie if I was telling the truth. In the end, it become possible for me to cancel the last dish which was never served.There are better Din Tai Fung outlets in Singapore

I am not a food tester. For me some kind of food are same, just to fill my stomach when I was hungry.One evening, when I have vacation in Resorts World Sentosa, my wife tells me to have a dinner at this restaurant. She likes it very much. After I come to reception, wow I was astonished with a little crowd that queing for go in to the restaurant. So I try to be patients, and voila, I must wait for 40 minutes!Is it Worthed? After the first taste, my tounge couldn't resist the flow of many kind of dumplings that served to me.Crazy! It's very delicious..! Must back again..

Our trip to Singapore was awesome!We loved every aspect of Singapore, except for Din Tai Fung @ Resorts World Sentosa!Summary of our experience:* We patiently waited 30 mins for a table for 6 as we were excited to eat at a highly recommended, Michelin starred restaurant.I know now, that Michelin stars don't take into account service.* We were seated alongside another family of 7, which was the beginning of a terrible dinner experience.RIDICULOUS SERVICE* Before we had even ordered our meal, a gentleman sitting close to us screamed out loud to the entire restaurant "How far away is my meal?! I've been waiting a long time!"We should have taken this as a warning!* We came as a family, we expected to eat as one.....* Our food came out separately & in 10 min intervals of one another!* There was NOT 10 mins during our dinner that 2 people were eating at the same time!* Our sit down dinner duration was 1 hour, my cousin didn't even get her dish, we cancelled her dish 50 mins into our meal, as we were already angered by the service & everyone had already finished their meals.....* Meanwhile the family sitting alongside us had received 2 dishes of the dish my cousin ordered!If you are going to sit two families together, be sure to treat each family the same & take note of what each family has ordered!Angered by the service, I spoke to the Manager & stated to her that it was unfair for us to pay the service charge considering the service we received was appalling!The lady Manager, provided me with a Chinese written receipt & took $10 off our meal.I'm not even sure if she discounted me the correct amount!We are so angry & disappointed with the service @ Din Tai Fung @ Resorts World Sentosa.Lift your game you lot! You have left a bad taste in our mouths for your brand

We had try Din Tai Fund when at Taiwan, so when visit RWS, try out this Branch.The Q can be better manage, example, sms us if it is our turn, rather then let us wait and stand outside so long. Food is great, as usual, price don't expect too much, haha. But once in a while, such dining experience is worth it
3
Funnily, I knew nothing about this restaurant, even though it's a chain and exists in my current home location. With one bite I knew the food was from Taiwan - made me smile. Service was quite slow and slightly confusing, but the food was hot and fresh. The food was good, but as there are plenty of good restaurants in Singapore, I wouldn't make a special trip to any of Din Tai Fung's locations. However, if you find yourself at mealtime in the vicinity, then give it a try
2
I've been to this restaurant many times in other locations (Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore)....however, this location didn't have about half the items I ordered during lunch.....it was a bit ridiculous. I'll chalk it up to a random snag, but was disappointed nonetheless. Also found this location to be very expensive compared to the others.
5
Super love this restaurant!!! I love their food!! Had it for take-out and no complaints! Except for the long queue!
4
I've tried din tai fung in KL, BKK and now in SIN and they can never disappoint me.
try thier xian log bao - pork (add on chillies which are placed on table), u will love it.
5
I love to eat at Din Tai Fung. All my order has really great taste. No wonder they got the Michellin rate for best restaurant.
5
Consistent Din Tai Fung quality and reasonable price despite of the location. Highly recommended! Must try dishes: Xiao Longbao, Beef Noodle, Fried pork chop (with fried rice) and the cold appetisers.
5
We ate almost every meal here while at RWS. Am sure the non veg is great, but we found the veg food limited but absolutely light and delicious.
Prices are quite reasonable too.
3
Heard so much about this restaurant. Managed to try it out at the branch in RWS. Ordered the Xiao Long Bao, 2 noodles and another 2 side dishes. It was ok. Nothing spectacular.
3
Don't let the waiting time put you off, it will be worth it. The cold starter of beef with Szechuan spice and also a cold pork with chilli dish really hit the spot. The steamed dumplings were great with wonderful flavour. The noodle dish was a bit strange . Some food ordered didn't arrive but we had it taken off the bill. The only let down was the service, slow and the staff appeared to not know what they were doing. When we went to pay the bill, the lady behind the counter was too interested talking in mandarin and drinking with her colleague. Plenty of other places to eat in Sentosa
4
This outlet has some dishes not served at the other outlets. Probably because of the many tourists at RWS from the mainland , the dishes are more authentic and unique compared to other outlets. Always great food - but how I wish they could stop using MSG. The whole day feels really heavy after a meal at Din Tai Fung due to the excessive MSG usage in almost all dishes.
5
Ooooh can't get enough of their truffle pork dumplings & yam dumplings. We can eat these everyday! My 4 yr old loves the shrimp & pork wanton soup noodles. Order the pork & crab meat xiao long bao too, these are good too! Also not forgetting their chicken soup! Hmm delicious
4
Din Tai Fung is very well known in Singapore and very popular. They have several outlets throughout Singapore and every other location we've been to have been just fine. This location did not measure up to our expectations. The menu is the same and the food we were served was fine, but they seemed slow and were out of a lot of dishes which we wanted to order. It's possible we would give it another chance if we were at TWS, but it would not be our first choice of locations for Din Tai Fun
3
Good food but definitely different from the originals in Taiwan. There was similar dishes but taste-wise, they were different except for the Xiao Long Baos.
5
As always, this is our family favorite rest. in singapore. All the food excellent and the price OK. Don't forget to try the dessert
1
This is very far from the excellent Din Tai Fungs in Taipei and HK. The food is not good, choice is small. All in, not worth it at all.
4
If you've eaten at DTF before you'll know. If you haven't you must try. Never fails to hit the spot.
The xiao long pau a little bit too dry this time, but otherwise excellent
4
Xiao Long Pao is good and the service of the restaurant is excellent but the long wait in queue was very uncomfortable in the hot Singapore climate
4
Food choices are wide and even considered good for a non-meat person like me. Service is prompt and friendly.The RWS branch when compared to the Raffles City branch, seems better in terms of food taste. Somehow our family felt it this way after trying both
4
After the whole day at the Universal Studio and the just the place to dine for dinner. The signature Truffle Xiao Long Bao dumpling is a must-try. Steam Chicken, Stir-fried Hong Kong Kailan with Special Sauce and Szechuan Wok-fried Diced Chicken with Sun-dried Chillies & Toasted Cashews was just amazing. Food is definitely a plus but the attending waitress was problematic, actually spilt the Chinese tea on the table and was not courteous to apologize. Thats the minus part
5
We had brunch as a large party - 10 adults, 3 kids & 1 infant. The crew made it work and we were able to all be seated at the same, long table. The dumplings and buns were top-notch. The cold dishes like the ham- wrapped cucumber was really good. The desert of hot peanut broth with glutinous peanut-filled balls is also recommended. Can't remember all the individual great dishes we had but I can remember that there wasn't one I didn't like
4
We had a quick lunch here and really enjoyed ourselves. The soup dumplings were a favourite. The service is very efficient particularly as you can place your order whilst you are waiting for a table to become available. Be warned the place is always busy but the wait wasn't too long
2
Took my children for holiday to see Universal Studio in Singapore and wanted to grab something to eat; we thought of something familiar with what we have in oir country so we went to Din Tai Fung.I had fried rice (so so, my maid could've done it much better), my wife & kids had noodle.80% of the waitress can't speak english which was a challange because when we asked was the noodle spicy or not she said not but when it came it was a bit spicy. Wouldn't bothered to reordered since one meal took 15minutes to arrived (for a noodle).Other than that was ok, the waitress was responsive but just poor in english speaking while i saw at least 3 to 4 different group of caucasia
