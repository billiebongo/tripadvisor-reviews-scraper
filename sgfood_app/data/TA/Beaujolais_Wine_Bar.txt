Its fun , nice staff but sincerely over price ..far too expensive to my liking unfortunately . Otherwise the atmosphere is great.

Love the different food flavours that you seldom find at a wine bar. Prawn, goat cheese, sausages, etc were all very tasty. Service was excellent. Highly recommend if all you want in a good day out is good food, good service and good music! What else do you need.

Beaujolais, a French styled wine bar in the club street area. The whole area is rich with charm and this little place is no exception I just stopped by on an afternoon walk and enjoyed a lovely glass of prosecco, alfresco style, overlooking the pretty streetscape. I can’t comment on the food, it was 3pm and kitchen closed. However, the wine was great, the atmosphere perfect and the price was right. It’s happy hour here, I think, 12-8pm. So, most of the time..... bonus! Style : 7/10 casual, a lot of business types. A bit faux French, but not too kitsch Price : 7/10 average. I paid $9 for a glass of wine Menu: can’t comment, didn’t eat Ambience : 9/10, the real selling point Location : 10/10. Near Chinatown, French quarter Satisfaction : 9/1

TA reviews and recommendation from friends made us visit this establishment when in area. Maybe they had a bad day or the kitchen had lost interest but we will certainly not be rushing back.The quiche was like warm and appeared to be reheated for the 3rd or 4th time it was bland and unappetizing.The Fillet steak which was requested to be cooked medium came as well done or very well done making it dry and fiberous. The steak had zero seasoning or prior preparation and was therefore not tasty. Apparently to cook it with garlic was a challenge to the chef as I was told he could not do that..... hmmmm.The accompanying salad was warm limp and certainly not fresh out the fridge let alone ground.Service was average and then good at end only after senior waiter asked our thoughts on food. Fairly high prices for what was not a memorable meal. Many better choices for steak around the city at comparable prices.

This is where I go when I want a great reasonably priced steak with a good glass of wine. It is located on Club Street in a French bistro setting. The tenderloin is my favourite cut, it comes with Salad and free flow fries. I usually top off my dinner with a creme brûlée. The staff is friendly and attentive. I love it here

Used to eat here a fair but but very disappointed on a recent visit. When we eventually got seated we were given three wine lists and one menu for our table. Waiter looked slightly annoyed when we asked for another menu which set the tone for the evening. When the starters arrived we had to ask for plates and so on and so on. Steak was good and priced wellBased on the service and haphazard approach to their customers i will not be returning in a hurr

The staff at Beaujolais are always welcoming. The place also serves great food and has a killer wine selection. On weekends there is a vibrant atmosphere, with lots of fun & thirsty party people
5
This restaurant has been a Club St icon for many years. My last visit was 4 or 5 years ago. The food is good pub type and the bar snacks arms great for a group. Definitely worth a visit,

Ordered a burger, have to say I've had much better at high end chains. Chips (fries) were nice and service was fairly attentive. Probably won't bother going back again, for a meal at least.
3
The food is average. Menu is short and efficient. The location is great if you like the party atmosphere and you go with friends! Prices are affordable. Not sure to go back but had a good time.

Comfortable and pleasant street location in the Club Street district. As the name would suggest - expect good wine here - and the Beaune Louis Jadot I had was a treat. Although at $90 usd you would expect so...A pleasant steak meal well cooked and did the trick. Fairly expensive, but that's what you get in Singapore I suppose. Expect good food, wine and service. I will return...
4
You cant go wrong with Beaujolais great food, great vibe, excellent reds and good service. As always a great steak after some good starters and all enjoyed over a superb bottle of red wine. The restaurant was busy but the service was good and we were lucky to get a table as a walk-in but well worth the effort. Do not miss this one but definitely book a table. Enjoy

Longstanding favourite for myself and friends. Steak is very reasonable and wine list is not badly priced either. Place is quite quirky and its in a great spot in the club st area to head on for some post dinner drinksOnly word of caution is that on Friday there seems to be more emphasis on the venue as a drinking place rather than a restuarant. Sadly it seems to be a hangout for red chino wearing arrogant shipping type brokers who look like they are on holiday from Romford. If you go on a Friday wear your gucci loafers and signet ring!All in all good spot though, definitely a go to place for a decent dinne
5
We had dinner at the restaurant which offered a good selection at very reasonable prices. We ate before 8pm so took advantage of the 'happy hour' reduction in price for a bottle of wine. It was 45$ instead of 80$ which reflects the generally ludicrous price of wine in Singapore. This is a popular wine bar and restaurant in a lively area near Chinatown
4
This restaurant is in a great location and eating outdoor on the terrace is so nice. The food is good quality whether that's a snack or starter of grilled prawns or squid, or a pasta or steak main course. And a good wine list goes with it. We've been twice and really enjoyed both visits. And worth noting many restaurants and bars in this area open and close quickly but Beaujolais remains
4
During a working day, I caught up with a friend in Singapore.We made our way to Chinatown and stopped at the well-positioned Beaujolais Wine Bar on Ann Siang Hill Rd next to the popular outdoor bar and restaurant hub of Club St to watch the passing crowds and enjoy a light lunch.Over a glass of rose, we shared some simple food and two missed salads.The service was good and the food light, fresh and well flavoured.A great spot to eat, drink and watch people.Give it a try
4
Nice place to have drinks and people watching , being in a corner. I had a breat steak and the wine we ordered was excellent. The service was good.
4
It's my second visit and the Beaujolais never disappoints. Very good atmosphere in the corner of Club Street. Good drinks and delicious food.
1
We were in the mood for burger and chose Beaujolais, which we should never have done. The burger had processed cheese (like eating plastic), the bun was sweet industrial produced and the fries was the fast food kind - not human food. Very disappointed.
4
I typically visit this spot on a Friday and it's right in the lively area of Club street which provides an awesome atmosphere for drinks before a night out. Good food - i like the roasted chicken, and pretty decent drinks. Good spot to people watch as well. Recommended for a night out with friends
3
we were in urgent need for a steak. sorry to say but this is quite far away from what I expect. meat quality was below average, sides are not worth to be mentionned. seems the place relies more on its excellent location and tourists rather than quality of food
4
I was skeptical about hung here as the reviews were not the greatest.Happily, 5 of us all had excellent steaks and good service .Good wine list.My caution here would be to make sure you get a good table - we had a great set up. Our table faced club st opposite the main bar . Our original table for 5 was tiny and not in a good position and would have made for a squashed awkward seating arrangement.There is karaoke so not a place to go for a romantic couples night as the boozed patrons behind us screeched like strangled cats - luckily the bar manager shuffled them downstairs. Good meals good service but not cheap.
5
First, the food is fantastic. The burger is a definite win and the duck is outstanding. When it comes to service the staff will comfort and serve you in a manner which is exceptional for Singapore. I can do nothing but recommend this page to everybody who's looking for good food with friendly staff and the vibrant atmosphere of club street
5
The food was outstanding. I had a duck and it was the perfect balance between cooked and crispy. The staff was amazing, very attentive waitress, who knew the menu by hard and was able to recommend items to my liking. I am a returning customer now and love the atmosphere ;)

Walked in here and was excited about having a glass of Beaujolais. Being from Europe and having been wine tasting in Beaujolais enjoying Morgon and Fleurie wines I was expecting a selection by the glass, but how disappointing I ended up with a glass of cab sav from Chile!!
5
Sitting out on the verandah watching the atmosphere on club street - combined with a good menu, made this a great place to be for a Saturday night out with friends. Lamb chops were super and my friends enjoyed succulent steak. An all round enjoyable meal accompanied by a lovely glass of Sauvignon Blanc
4
Great location on the terrace. Quiet, good food & service & a cigarette can be taken without fuss. Go again? Yes
4
Had a very good steak with a bottle red. Great location and ideal for people watching. Lots going on in Club Street. Staff pleasant and I would go back.
4
A great place full of people to have a beer or wine, located in the hot spot of Singapore and with a very nice setup.

This place has all the right aesthetics. Corner location, quaint trendy heritage building. Chequered tablecloths and assumedly a reasonable menu although I haven't dined there before. I gave however frequented on a number of occasions, mainly well, yes, because it's so aesthetically appealing.But..... The staff have an attitude unto themselves. Each time I visit, I'm not sure who's having more of a party, the visitors or the staff. They shout and laugh with each other across the restaurant irrespective of diners' need to have a quiet chat with maybe a bit of music and liveliness. They are hard to find for orders and are generally just too dominant and perhaps too many (?) for a place of the given size. It makes one want to down one's drink and leave ASAP. A shame as this place has far greater potential.
4
I have been to Beaujolias many times for lunches, dinners, drink sessions.The food is without doubt fantastic and fairly priced, it's a lovely place to sit outside and watch the night unfold. The service is a bit hit and miss and there have been times where I would never ever go again with drinks added to the bill. So I keep it to lunches and dinner with only 1 other person.I highly recommend it for food and a drink at lunch
5
Excellent Bar:Very Good ServiceTop Selection on Spirts Good Selection of BeersSitu: Club Street SG Pricing: Quite costly 2 x Large Belverdere Vodka n Coke S$44 (Â£22.00) some of this price is due to Singapore High Tax. None the less a very trendy place to drink with a really good selection of drinks .Great place to hang out, chat, date and socialise.Top mark

Went there with a friend. Ordered vodkas for both all night. Never once asked what vodka we wanted. Got the bill at the end and they billed us for Ketel One vodka when their housepour was Smirnoff!!! They admitted the staff was at fault but refused to bring the price down to housepour. They said housepour vodka was only used for cocktails?!?!?! Will never step into this establishment again.
3
This area of Sigapore (Club Street) is very trendy and full of expats. Therefore prices are set for expats and for instance, at Beaujolais, a main will cost at minimum $25++. For this price, you can find much nicer in the area ! Also we were not lucky because it was extremely noisy due to a "party" in the bar across the road, but the street is never quiet ! Service was great, but I wouldn't come back for an average dinner
3
I love Club Street/Ann Siang Hill where this resturant is located especially now that they have finally pedestrainised the street at the weekend.The resturant is in a lovely spot a nice old building, the service was attentive. The menu however I found a bit strange I mean it is assumed to be french but the menu was really wide ad varied and Im happy I like steak which was ok or else I would have had to have eaten pasta (?) or fish and chips.... I found this stragely u french should have researched more before the going ther
3
the food was great, but the area was very busy and extremely loud we ended up sitting on a dreadful slope which meant we had to hold onto our glasses or they would have disappeared off of the table as did the juices from one of the steaks 
4
Yum yum, bit thin by Aussie standards but perfectly cooked and the goats cheese entree omg!!! Well worth the visit!!!!!!
4
Whether you want a bite to eat or drink fine wine this is the place to go.Situated in one of Singapores liveliest bar streets this is a trendy bar. The prices might be a bit high but the Chabilis went down well. Plenty of people watching with kind attentive staff.They set up a fresh table for us
1
Myself and a group of friends here. The service was appalling we order 1 tapas dish of chorizo sausages, they took over an hour to arrive. When the manager was advised of the situation no apology was forthcoming merely an argument as to when we put the order in! Overall the bar is not geared a to chilled glass of wine and some food with friends. From the bar staff to the manager they present themselves as guys running their own mini night club and the whole bistro wine bar ambience is lost in the pumping house music. Great location though and its a pity its being run so badly. I will not return nor would I recommend it to anyone, other than the heavy drinking party crowds on a Saturday night
1
Showed up to an empty restaurant. Well dressed and ready for a nice glass of wine. Was by myself and the rude waiter said I could stay if I wasn't going to be long. Growing up in NYC, this treatment in Singapore was shocking to me. So rude! Had a drink across the street and still saw three empty tables after I left that place. This place gets customers who read Lonely Planet guides. I would avoid this expensive and rude tourist trap
4
This place is opposite my office and I am most definitely a regular. The service is always brilliant, the food is much better than it was around 5-6 months ago and the atmosphere is always great. Certainly one of the best places in Singapore for a long lunch.The place is great for friends, business drinks or meetings or a good long lunch. The view is not scenic exactly, but you do get to see the world go past which on such a great junction is certainly a show in itsel
5
It's like stepping into someone's home..the atmosphere is very intimate and despite the small space, this bar carries quite a good range of wines from different regions. Prices are reasonable, as you're looking at $8-$12 for a glass and from $25 for a bottle of wine.
4
We had a charcuterie plate and some wine and Scotch...it was delicious...the owners were friendly and charged my iPhone for me. We got there around 4pm, but by 5:30 the after-work energy was palpable...for a Thursday night it was an absolutely delightful and highly civilized place to be. A little more mature crowd, which suited me, but fun and lively, nonetheless.Bring your girlfriend, your wife or your mother...and your wallet (it's Singapore, after all). Or bring a few mates and toss back a few cold ones and watch the lovelies walk by

Last time I was here I had the carbonara (with cream..) and the gf had the quiche (huge portion). Both were very decently priced and tasty quite nice. The carbonara has a deep and rich flavor (lots of cream and salt) and albeit not traditionally Roma style it is a nice change from my daily Asian dishes. The gf couldn't finish the quiche so lucky me, leftovers!The food and wine are ok but the problem I have with this place is that the music and noise does not match the checkered Montmartre tablecloths, bentwood chairs and nice alfresco seating. Every time I'm there or walk past the music is banging very loud and the waiting staff is controlling the music player with their own iPods. This usually leads to overly loud Neyo, David Guetta, etc and just not fits a relaxing wine session euro style. Last time I left early after my meal and had my final rounds of wine at the Spanish place across the road. All in all, not the best place in Club Street. Would def be back but check the music before walking in
4
This is place on a corner open to the street with a few tables. Its more like a local bar than a wine bar. Service is good. The music excellent but it is an expat/ tourist hangout.But the crowd is nice and its fun place to be and watch the world go by on Club Street.Simple food but not worth a trip just for that

I live and work in Singapore and have a good knowledge of the many eating and drinking establishments in Singapore. Beaujolais is situated in the Ang Siang Hill area adjacent to Chinatown. The food is of average quality on a limited menu and compared to other establishments near by like Emporium the food is over priced. In addition the staff try to rush you out rather than let you enjoy an after food digestive. This is not subtle either - we were asked to leave directly because some other people were waiting to eat. In short not worth the time or money - check out other places in the area
