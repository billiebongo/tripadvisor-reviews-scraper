Tried Many restaurants be it South Indian or North . Did not try food here as it was unclean , they should really focus on cleanliness too apart from food which am sure would be fine

After a Long Long time, We have got a good food joint worth going and enjoying authentic Indian Food with nice ambience. Also the price is very reasonable. Highly recommendable for Vegetarians!
4
Amidst busy little India this is one good restaurant for pure vegetarians where only veg. Options are available.
One can have good combos and a-la carte options to choose. Punjabi platter was good. Dosa was also good.
Can come for meals surely.
5
The food is amazing and tasty if compare with other Indian restaurant in Singapore. I love Raj Kachori and North Indain Thali and Mango Lassi.
1
In a food paradise called Singapore, this was a disappointment.
Ordered idlis. Hard. Coconut chutney spoilt.
Dosa was average.
Vegetable biriyani was oily.
The bill for two came to 40 dollars. Expensive.
Please avoid

If you go to this place, after reading my review, trust me you can curse me! It is a very good veg restaurant. Especially, people from Karnataka will like it a lot. It is not Tamil Nadu style like many other Veg places in Singapore. One Mr. Arun is very helpful and we would have had atleast 7 meals in this place and each time, we liked it. You will not miss Bangalore for sure. This place is next to Mustafa mall.

This is one more restaurant in Little India near mustafa center where Jain people can go and enjoy their meal. This restaurant serves food till late night & No Onion No Garlic Vegetarian food. They understand prepare food which is completely pure Jain. on my 7 days trip to Singapore and being Jain I had food here for 2 days. There are many other restaurant in same vicinity which will also serves vegetarian Jain food but not of this quality and taste.There is one more restaurant approx 500 meters away from Mustafa Center Gokul Vegetarian which serves ONLY no onion no garlic food, though they use potatoes

Amazing daal bati churma thali at a very reasonable price. The quantity is too good. One really needs to force themselves to finish one full thali. Friendly staff. Restaurant can be kept cleaner. Recommend to visit this place during weekdays, it’s crowded on the weekends and there’s a slight change of taste in the food when it’s busy
5
Been there couple of times during my visit to singapore its was an amazing experience at this price it was the best meal i had there ordered North Indian Thali on both the occasion & the food was really amazing and the staff was very nice & Courteous ,, Any one visitng singapore must atleast have one meal at this Restuarant
5
Visited this restaurant twice for dinner in last one week in Singapore and ordered South Indian meal/thali both the times (they also have a North Indian meal) .... This restaurant is bang opposite Mustafa centre in little India . it was one of the best and amazingly satisfying food you can have. It was so filling and tasty I finished everything in meal .3 types of vegetables ,2 types of dal(sambar and rasam dal) , Dahi, a sweet ( kheer), a reasonably big portion of rice with papad and puris...... can you beat that ? I wanted to change sweet to another portion of Dahi and management readily did that smiling .......thank you .That too all of it superbly tasty and Indian taste right in the heart of Singapore . Now add the bonus it's a pure vegetarian restaurant. Also the ambience was quiet and lightening prefect with good slow devotional music playing in back ground to compliment the experience.I met the owner Mr Puneet ( surprised that he is North Indian serving great South Indian fare too ) .who took the order from me, was instructing his people and active right on ground zero.....great work ( sorry was observing) he is hands on right on his restaurant giving attention and personal touch to customers. Which is rare but amazingly appreciated by me.i guess such gestures outside India giving lasting impression and earning lots of good will and blessing for business. Keep up the good work ......might pleased and highly appreciate the pleasure of Great Indian food on foreign soil.

One of the decently priced Indian restaurants with good taste near Mustafa. Their staff is nice too. Liked the dahi wada !!
2
Tried some tangra chinese and parathas here . Quite poorly prepared. Much better options available around race course road. Service is so so.
5
Lovely food combined with excellent service.
Thanks a ton for taking care of our Singapore trip
Jain &call chats were mast👌👌

Went there for lunch during our Singapore visit. Food was costly and not much quantity also. Paneer tikka was too good and literally it melted in our mouth. Good service but ambience is average. If not bothered about money, then its a good hotel. Else there are many other options in little India
2
I visited on 26.12/16 around 4 pm after shopping at Mustafa Center (it is right across from the Center). I was happy to actually have the opportunity to sit down in a very clean and comfortable place with AC.I ordered fresh watermelon juice which has a 'thumps up' recommendation on their menu. However they didn't have this. I ordered 'pani puri' which was below average and had hair in it. I returned this and it was replaced. I noted that gloves are not worn when making pani puris.I also ordered samosas which was average. As it's right across from the Mustafa Center I would only cones here as a quick rest stop and have a snack or quick drink. I haven't tried any main meals but don't think I will.I noted it got packed out quickly after I got here eventhough its Monday 4pm

Visited Balaji Bhavan with family recently during our tour to Singapore. It's a pure vegetarian hotel with variety of delicious food. Quality of the food is very good as well as the ambience of the hotel is also good. The services are prompt with a smile.Nice,kind and enthusiastic welcoming gesture by Ms Monica added a flavour to the taste. Thank you Ms Monica for making us feel homely as we felt as if we we having food at a known place.Will surely visit next time when in Singapore.Sundiipsundiip@kitetourism.ne

We went to this restaurant on last Saturday ie.e 8th Oct at around 9 pm. The hotel staff told us to wait for 10 minutes as there were no table available. We decided to wait since we were first in the queue. After sometime the couple behind us directly went inside and took the table which we were supposed to take as per FCFS. When we told hotel staff, they said sorry, the couple has already taken the table and have ordered already. We patiently said okay since we were hungry and got the seat in next 5 minutes.We ordered Paneer Tikka, Daal Makhani and Butter Naan. Paneer Tikka came all broken into multiple pieces with no onion, no other sidies (forgot to take the picture)in short it was terrible but the rate was 10SGD for such a started.. Butter Naanâ€™s size is like of chapati. We were totally disappointed to see the food. THE WORST part was the cleanliness of the hotel and the service. I have attached the pics taken at the hotel, can clearly see how miserably dirty it is form inside. Tthe rate is so damn high for such a restaurant. Please comment, if you want to know any more details of this restaurant.I have been in Singapore for more than 2 years now, and never faced such kind of issues/ servies in Singapore. Least my friends and I are never going here again

As this is located exactly opposite to mustafa centredone with shopping, everyone try to catch the nearest vegetarian restaurant, .But as they entered to balaji Bhavan, after eating & paying bills feels very disappointed.1 --- food quality is not good, very spicy.2---- quantity is very less.3---- staff & service is poor.4------ plan is to grab money from customer,
5
Very nice food. I stayed in Singapore 4 days but first day I was eat other restaurant but from 2nd day I tried in Balaji Bhawan, I ordered north Indian thali. It's excellent taste. Everyday I ordered different food n all food was very nice. I never eat like this food in India also. Specially I say thanks to Balaji Bhawan cashier boy which is from Gujarat. He suggested Everyday different food. U can see thali's photos in my reviews. U must try food at balaji whenever u visited singapore. Best vegetarian food in Singapore

Friendly staff.
Very very average food.
Kitchen not clean.
Very very low portion of food.
Homestyle food not restaurant style.
Poor buffet menu.
But menu card has lots of options.
3
from the looks of it seemed like a decent place, but very unhygenic and arrogant service. no value for money meal.
4
We ate dinner three times there during our stay in Singapore.
The food is good. They offer a North Indian buffet at SG14.5 which is also quite good.
4
You get really tasty & delicious food with prompt service. A real treat for all Veggies. It is opposite to Mustafa Mall You get a feeling of Indian food.
5
While my cravings for south Indian breakfast were rising..i found this one right opposite to mustafa...what next..went in..ordered dosa n coffee.....made my day...lil thing though.
5
Indian veg food, good quality and quantity , tast was wanderful enjoy the indian food . Very tasty and gygine also once should visit it
5
I am living in Singapore and I Admire the quality of food they serve therefore I give 5 stars, there is shortage of manpower in food industry so I do expect some delays in serving specially if it's a weekend .This restaurant still try its best , the best part I like is owners are always around to take care of customers , little advice , make sure what all you want and try to order at one time , change of order and repeat order usually get delayed during rush hours .
2
After tiring outdoor day with back to back activities, this restaurant was the one which hit the EYE as VEGETARIAN and the doorman was Gujarati Indian which pleased us to go and have the food.Food was seem to just made warm but made earlier and prior or been made from ready to cook pack.Staff is too arrogant and their mentality is not that the client shall go stomach full with smile rather they are in the frame to grab the money from client's pocket
1
Everything is terrible here whether it is food, hygiene, service or behavior of staff. They serve a la carte and buffet food. I think I have never rated any restaurant terrible but this one is an exception.Service was terrible, the staff was arrogant, seating was too congested and the worst part unhygienic place with suffocation.Try to avoid going to this restaurant. There are lot of hygienically good eateries nearby try them
3
We had good north Indian dinner there..Honestly food was good and staff was cordial with us...however we were travelling in group and behavior of their staff with two of the families of our group was extremely rude and not acceptable..The manager appeared to be little over confident and least bothered about guests..I would have rated this Hotel as good going by food quality but overall feel of place is very basic with unprofessional attitude of staff adding to woes.
3
We had north Indian dishes and the taste was decent. The Hygiene factor is questionable as the servers do not wear gloves or uniforms. The water jug on the table was open. If they improve on the Hygiene it will definitely deserve a 5 star
2
Balaji Bhawan is a place that you better not go because you can find many others nearby which are excellent. Go to Saravana Bhawan or Kailash Parbat. Avoid this place. Pricey, Unhygienic, mismanaged.
5
Just discovered this place while working through little india.Amazing both North Indian and South Indian food. Value for money. Personalised attention from the owners.
2
Manager and one deputy manager out side of restaurant try to convince people to come in.. service and food is poor.. not recomanded
3
good Indian food for middles class traveller. Its Thali being served mostly with SouthIndian stuff and few North Indian stuff also. hygienic atmosphere and friendly staff. should try once as option
5
All You Are Looking For When You are Hungry & Need Feeling of Homely Food to Full-Fill Your APPETITE. Had a wonderful experience.
2
They server south Indian as well north Indian food.
Average quality.
Very crammed sitting.
Toilet not clean and spotted two rats in the dining area.
Place needs through cleaning and revamp.
5
Went here for a quick snack. Ordered dosas and lassi to try it out and it was glorious. so glad we chanced upon this place after going to mustafa. Ambiance was basic but it was clean which was the only thing that's important. Recommended!

This restaurant is located bang opposite Mustaffa and was earlier known as Sagar Ratna. The place is very crowded during the weekend with Indian tourists flocking . The food is decent (one should try north indian. they also serve chaats ) but is not well maintained and is not great on hygiene . overall decent food but the place is average and the crowd management during peak hours needs to improve

My partner and I came here after work for the very first time. We were very famished. We ordered a classic Italian pizza, cream of mushroom which we told the server to serve this first as obviously we were going to have it as an appetiser, an orange juice and an apple juice. We asked if the juices were fresh and the server said yes. What came first was the pizza instead of the drinks. We felt weird because usually the drinks would come first instead of the food, but that was fine because we could adjust ourselves. Then came the orange juice. It was obviously not fresh because my partner and I works in the F&B line and we know how fresh orange juice taste like. 5 minutes later, the cream of mushroom was served. It did not look appetising at all. It has no taste at all and it was water-like texture, and taste. It was not creamy at all. We really lost our appetite to eat. We told the person-in-charge about the soup and he said he would just cancel it off the bill. After that, my apple juice arrived. It is pretty weird that it did not arrive the same time as the orange juice. Would never visit this place again. Thank you
4
Visit this place if you are a pure veg and need to have some Indian food. Excellent in Punjabi food.
5
We r still here in singapore..we tried so many restaurants..but we got best punjabi taste here...we are pure vegetarian...I like specially the way of the owner Monika..who is very dedicated to his work..and very active.. service is also good..
Regards

Good for Indian food, Veg and amazing south Indian food, located in Little India near Mustafa center
3
I ordered the South Indian Vegetarian Thali and it was good considering it's low price but I will not be back because there are better meals to be had in that neighborhood for the same price. Mango lassie was good. Service was utilitarian at best.
4
This restaurant serves both North and South Indian food but the taste of it's South Indian food I feel is very authentic by which I mean the sambhar has a very South Indian taste and so does the filling in the dosas. The idlis and the coconut chutney are magnificent and probably the best two things on the Balaji Bhawan menu and anyone who likes idlis even remotely is bound to love them at this restaurant. The Dahi Vada is something I never prefer but I did try it from my cousin's plate and it was decent.The Onion Rava Masala dosa is my most favourite dosa in the world, the crisp onions, the brilliant texture of rava and the tasty albeit South Indian tasting masala was a great melange of perfect flavours, HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The servers were really busy so we had to wait to place the order. The desserts on the menu were very average, the Gulab Jamun was not as soft as one would have hoped. The overall experience at the restaurant was very satisfactory. I may not be going here again very soon but probably when I fee like having another crisp Onion Rava Masala Dosa

After shopping at Mustafa we entered Balaji Bhawan that was right opposite to Mustafa Centre. I am not a big fan of Gujarati or Rajasthani cuisine because I have never come across a good restaurant serving Gujarati and Rajasthani cuisine in Singapore.I was a little apprehensive about trying this place but my colleague who is from Gujarat really seemed keen on trying Gujarati Thali and I really did not have the heart to say no to her so off we went. They serve a lot of interesting thalis and I really liked that they tasted exactly like the thalis you would get in Gujarat, well, that’s what my colleague said. I did not particularly prefer the thali that much but she seemed to enjoy it. I believe my palette is still not open to Gujarati and Rajasthani cuisines but this was a start. The restaurant is not too expensive and if you want to grab a bite after shopping at Mustafa Centre, this could be a place to go to. The Staff was friendly but I would not classify Balaji Bhawan as quick service resturant.Their “Dal Bati Churma” was what my friend asked me to try. It was interesting but a little to bland for my palette. The amount of ghee they poured into it repulsed me because I love ghee but I hate fishing my food out of ghee. If you enjoy Gujarati Thali, Balaji Bhawan could be one of yoir choices because of the authenticity of its thalis
1
We ended up in this place by mistake, because they are located just opposite Mustafa Exit No 2. As soon as we entered, we realized that we are in a wrong place, because there were hardly any customers, even though it was dinner time. They asked us to check out the Veg Buffet, but the items looked very old and unattractive. The whole place had a dull ambiance, with dark marks on the wall near the AC. Not wanting to be biased by looks alone, we decided to try out the food, but we were disappointed. The Paav Bhaji was made with some kind of Meat Masala, and hardly tasted like what it should be. The Dahi Puri was also bland, with sweet dahi, and some weird tasting stuffing. We came out highly disappointed ! Looks like they are able to survive only due to their prime location
5
We went there during Chinese New Year, and the foods were great. We ordered the South Indian set, and the Methi Mutter Malai was really great. Its cashew nut taste was really creamy and thick. The price was a bit worthy and it can be reached very nicely (in front of Entrance 2 of Mustafa Centre). You may take MRT and get off at Farrer Park station and walk just less than 200 m
5
It was wonderful to find this veg Indian restaurant serving variety of dishes from all parts of India. Be it south Indian, western, North Indian, the taste was uncompromised and scrumptious. My family of four had a wonderful time, and treated ourselves there thrice in a short trip of 4 days. Must go!!-Ishita Gupt

No sooner you enter this pure vegetarian restaurant you will find its owner sitting in the first table howling table number no sooner you enter... The number is a command to the roaming waiters to make the guest sit on the commanded table number... Since we opted for a buffet and we had a toddler with us who was not to eat anything so the restaurant staff did not allow us to offer a seat for the toddler... Reasoning? We paid for only 4 adults and hence can be afforded only 4 seats... don't darr to visit their washrooms... They are much shabby than a municipality restroom in India... Food was as cold as the staff.. I heard a person scolding a guest and snubbing him not to shout when he just said that there was no naam and there were 10 members of the group waiting for a chapati ... My advice please avoid balaji
5
This is a vegetarian restaurant . You get variety of Thali's like North Indian thali , South Indian thali , tandoori thali , executive thali . And lots of other variety of tasty fd .

Went here yesterday for dinner with my new friend aka bhai from Mumbai together with my sister. He's a pure vegan. Tried the naan and paneer (not sure whats the name of the dish) other dishes!! And our fav roasted papad. Walaaaa yummy food.
4
I had been here for breakfast buffet & for lunch buffet too.
The food here is really good with taste.
the indian cusine buffet has good varities too.

Went late one night and ordered a thali and dosa. Overall quite good food. Service was good also. Really liked the dal in the thali.
3
When you are out of country if you find restaurant serving dishes of your country you will get excited particularly when you have gone for long hours of shopping at Mustafa Center as it is just opposite to it. Interior is average like Bombay South Indian Restaurant. Actually this is south Indian Restaurant. Though the menu is big but in the taste of dish you will find south Indian touch. Average taste but you enjoy it as you get your food. In busy hours you may have to wait to get seat
5
We had visited the restaurant as part of group tour. The food quality and taste was excellent. The owner was super helpful and always contributed more than committed to the menu. Everyday the variety was kept up and changed and comfort of every type of guest was taken of. 10 on 10 from my end
5
A bit expensive given the Thali that i had but the food was good and fresh. Not a very big restaurant and its a cheap eatery. So don't expect anything fancy and just have your meal. You will enjoy and be surprised looking at that little Idli
3
The actual name is the restaurant as per the receipt is Ballaji Bhawaan Vegetarian and the above name in the trip advisor is misleading. We had Idly and Dosa to be very frank, the taste was below average.The is located diagonally opposite to the Mustafa Centre side enteranc
5
After shopping at Mustafa Center we decided to have dinner at near by restaurant. Since my wife is pure vegetarian we decided to give a go to Balaji Bhawan. We had to wait for around 15 minutes to get seats which is always a good sign. Since we were hungry, we went for thali's and we were not disappointed. While waiting for Thali we ordered Mango lassi that was pretty good.The vegetable portions in the Thai were decent and they offered fresh naan's. Food was tasty but on Saturday night they could have done with more of to more waiters
5
Have been to singapore so many times and this is my favourite eating place !! The warmth and sheer exuberance with which the members of this restaurant right from the owner Mr. Manish Garg to the last person ...they all together make sure that one has a delightful dining experience !!The food is lip smackingly tasty and of top quality ...not very expensive and serves all cuisines...and all of them...believe me all of them are utmost precise in taste and Indian ness Make sure you have one meal at this restaurant when in singapore for work/holiday. Definitely cannot misskudos to team Balaji bhawan 
3
i visited this place for lunch and for dinner.
- Buffet dinner was really good, with great options and freshness
- Other meals were equally bad
- the staff attitude was horrible, they don't bother once you order something
5
Food was very good. Staff was very polite. We took lunch for 3 days and no complaint with food. Location is very much easy as Mustufa Market is just opposite.
2
Roti's were burnt and service was terrible. Waiter was rude and was very unhappy when we wanted our Roti's to be remade. Give this place a skip.
3
Average test of Indian veg food. Would not recommend as there would be lot of more options to explore m
5
If you are alone than this is the best place . You get 4 varieties of dahlia with good tasty food . Besides North Indian , South Indian we get jain thali and excesutive thali which has slightly more rich food like paneer etc . All thali have a sweet dish also 
1
Avgerage indian food served by Bad Staff.!!...if you are visitng as a group ask your tour operatro NOT to take you here.....read more...Balaji bhawan claims they can cater to group, but they will pack you into the restaurant like a bunch of vultures on a carcase...ensuring that there is no space left on the tables... "this row is reserved please accomodate on other side" shouted the manager Vinod garg when we entered the restaurant... it felt as if he was doing a favour serving food to us..."No you cannot bring thr Baby pram" was his next comment when i lost it. So what if was traveling with my todllers... they dont care... they jsut want to ensure that everyone in the group is packed in....You can be rest assured that you would be treated like prrisoners in a queue in the jail take you thali and then find a place in the small resotuarant and mind it please dont sit at ease and eat food.. as the next group is coming in. so hurry up.. thats what you will feel...Highly NOT recommended to visit... at the end of a tour the last thing you want is someone asking you to sit as tight as possible and finish your food... and if you are with kids or toddlers..please ensure your baby prams are outside the restaurant even if the baby is sleeping in the pram...!! instead of expexting them to help us with the situation they created nuisance...Shame this is an Indian restaurant in Singapore.! your food might be fine.. but your attitude stinks.! ....note mr Manager MR VINOD please correct your attitude

Had a jain thali with my mom here. Food was good.. but service was average we had to wait for pickles, chillies and water for over ten minutes after our food was served.Nothing to complain about the food.. it was very nice esp the yellow dal. Loved the food here..
5
You will find good Indian food here. buffet system available. Food taste is good and is better than other places. A pure veg restaurant in little India. You will find better place to sit and relax . Thanks to Mr. Manish for a wonderful food for us group . Our group was 103 persons . All of them enjoyed the meals . And its Jain food . Next also if i will arranged the group will definately booked the food at Balaji Restaurant .
4
After trying out all possible south Indian food around mustafa, we had been here for a dinner....Thali's (Gujrati and Rajasthani) were very good and we loved the change...If u r a thali lover and craving for the same in Little India, this is one of the best place to go
2
Been here with my family, quite run down place, not great food and extremely bad service. They feel they are doing you a favor by allowing you to have food. The taste is quite good but the portions are very small and the service quite bad.Will i go there again? No nev

You will find good Indian food here. Both, buffe or ala carte system available. Food taste is good and is better than other places. A pure vegie restaurant in little India. You will find better place to sit and relax.

Not satisfied with service and food , owners themselves dont care , sitting arrangements is too crowdy like a mumbai local train
4
One of the things I remember is the excellent tea..teh tarik. It's the best pick me up in the morning. This restaurant serves great south indian breakfast and snacks just like what we get back home.
3
Ballaji Bhawan is definitely not a place worth a second visit on my list. The food was just average and tasted a bit bland. The only thing worth noting was the service that was quite fast given the fact that the place was crowded
2
We went to Balaji on recommendation of fellow travellers. While food was good to an extent, i got a cold masala tea and when i complained to the lady manager, she just overlooked me. The apple with fruit icecream salad was sour and nobody cared when we complained about that too. The toilet was as filthy as you can get in Indian Dhabas. Bikanerwala, another restaurant nearby gave a better experience in everything - food quality, service as well as cleanliness. Pani puri was brilliant there
3
Let's start from the beginning.. We went there because the place looked very crowded.. The manager gave us a waiting number 2.. But then took us as the third guest.. Inside the restaurant OMG! A few Customers were complaining about the orders they had placed.. Someone had ordered a coffee.. But left without having it.. We didn't get glasses to drink water till the food came after around 15 minutes of order.. Another family sitting next to us had ordered something but then they also didn't get what they wanted... The food was really good.. The quantity a little less.. But three stars is just about perfect for this restaurant..
4
We went here for a birthday party. Though it is just opposite mustafa we never made a visit to this place. To be frank it is written pure vegetarian restaurant so never thought of going and eating North Indian veg as we eat the same at home everyday:)Loved the North Indian veg food and even the Dessert was yummy !! You will enjoy the food 
5
superb food dont miss this res all items r tasty and located in front of musthafa center gate we had dinner all four days in same res, for veg people dont take breakfast in hotel just stay there and have ur breakfast in this res, because in hotel veg and non veg is mixed together, so for aged people from south india and for jains from north india wont like break fast in hotels so while booking book ur hotel in surrounds of musthafa and take option like thi
5
We went for lunch a few times. Taste is authentic Indian. Both Chinese and North Indian thali are very good, reasonable rates and tasty. One of the best dishes I liked was simple Alu-Gobhi with Naan, really delicious.They sell sweets and starter items also, its also delicious and can be tried.Location is very convenient directly opposite Mustafa
4
If you are first time visitor to this place, you might find it is not very easy to step in as you do not see the inside very well from the street due to dark illumination system of the house. However, do not worry, you can find a great series of foods inside with reasonable price. In this restaurant, we loved Dosa, especially the special dosa very much. It came in very crispy crepe with good quantity which make you full by itself. We also loved Lassi drink, the sweet one. The set menu was also fine but we were not very impressed by Parak Paneer. We hope the quality of cheese to improve.Overall, recommended. $10- $12 per person for lunch with drink.
