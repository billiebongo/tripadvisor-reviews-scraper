If you do not want to queue for a table at Tampines Mall, this restaurant is for you. I ordered seafood baked rice. The squid tasted bland while the shrimps were crunchy from soaking in soda water. Perhaps other dishes will be better.

I like the recommended salted fried chicken and dimsum. The pineapple and bitter gourd soup is also great if you are having a runny nose, makes you comfy.

We ordered crispy chicken chop and a smarter of Taiwan staples. The bubble teas should be avoided, but the mains are pretty on point. The staff are also polite and food was served pretty fast.

As usual, we went there for quick work lunch. The reason is simple that it is always easy to secure a seat there

Taste is still not as authentic as Taiwan. Tried the oyster mee Sua but the oyster contain a weird smell. Nevertheless, the staff are friendly and even given me their membership foc.

Love the Braised Platter, however their flask for the drink is smelly (may be the dishwasher did not clean it properly).

This is the place if you love Chinese or Taiwanese food because you donâ€™t have to travel far to get some flavour of it!

I wasn't too hungry but I really was craving for some savoury food. Turns out the salted chicken and braised intestines were great choices for me.

2 of us had porridge, noodles n san bei chicken. All were nice! Especially the chicken. Will cone again.

We visited for lunch and ordered two bowls of braised pork with rice, as well as gyoza.The portions were okay, but the meat could have tasted stronger with more spices like cinnamon and star anise etc. You have the choice to upgrade the dish to a set.The gyozas were rather disappointing, and the skin was thick.The drinks we ordered were also very weak

The Tampines outlet ambience is the best, i feel like I am in Taiwan. I ordered Ru Rou Fan and it tasted like the one in Taiwan!

Ordered omelette, fried rice, braised pork rice bowl and oyster mee sua. Tasted ok and could be more flavorful.

Good service, pretty decent taiwanese cuisine for those who misses taiwan food. Family or couples can go.

Excellent ambiance and food! Nice portion and Will consider going again.
The service was great as well.

Food is ok for the price. Not expensive. Milk tea is good. Ambience and service are average. Just a normal, simple eatery place.

Ambience and good gives you a taste of taiwan. Love their street snacks and milk tea! Food is always served hot.

I tried Mala braised beef noodle. The beef is so soft as if it melted in my mouth. I here with booking via eatigo app (50% off). I did enjoy this noodle.

The place was not too crowded and the service was fast. Food tasted good and it was affordably priced
5
had a good time dining with my family , there was a variety of food which price is pretty affordable . the portion of food is large as well

Ordered the braised pork rice and seafood udon. Food was served fast (but it could be because there was only one other couple in the restaurant). Portions were large for the braised pork rice, and the amount of seafood given was generous for the seafood udon. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick meal
