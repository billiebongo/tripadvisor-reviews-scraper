Had dinner with friends at Wine & Chef.. Order the Salmon Risotto, Seafood Capellini, Duck Leg, some small bites and 2 bottles of wine.. They were all very good, especially the seafood capellini which is fantastic .. Price is affordable with these kind of great food and good Italian wines.. Will be back again soon

Have visited this restaurant twice in the 5 days we have been in Chinatown. Each time has been a foody experience. The chef is a skilled interpreter on how food should be cooked and prepared.The restaurant itself is not a huge place but the ambiance is good and tends to make you feel that your choice was right in the first place. Now it isn’t a cheapo neither is it dear! The choices of wines are good and once again not cheap.Let’s face it you will never get perfection in costs for food and wine. Singapore is not cheap if you go up a rung or two with restaurants. We tried the cheaper end along with the food halls both are good value for money but we like to try all sorts of styles. Wine and Chef fitted the bill for us and we have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to any visitor to Singapore. It will be an experience for al

Brought my fiancée there to celebrate our 4th anniversary. It was a very pleasant and lovely dinner
5
Was greated with an excellent service crew who were very warm and friendly. The food was as good as reviews say
5
Food was amazing. There was no one dish that wasn't good. I was impressed with the short ribs the most - tender and juicy. Food and wine were reasonably priced too. The only issue I had was the small furniture and chairs. My legs were hitting against the table. But overall a good experience
4
Food and service is very good. Just that the portion is relatively small for the sharing ribeye. Would like to see a sharing and an individual ribeye selection. Had to order another portion of fries to be full.

Went there for a dinner date and was extremely satisfied after the meal. The scallop capellini was our favorite. For dessert we had the rice pudding and really enjoyed it as well.
5
Mac & Cheese Croquette - really nice when hot and crispy Wagyu Beef Carpaccio Mushroom Risotto - with onsen egg and goes well Crab Meat Hokkien Mee - fusion, very unique, the sauce is really good goes well with the pasta and importantly has many prawns and clams are fresh Venere Rice Pudding - POP POP POP Warm Cherry Brownie - brownie with cherries inside and ice cream

Went here with some friends in early Dec and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Started with a beer but moved on to wine. They have a great selection but the Syrah recommended was good value for money. Their food selection is awesome and we tried the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, Salmon Confit 'Risotto' and the Slow Roast Duck Leg - all got the thumbs up from the team. We sat outside as the weather was cool and the scenery nice.
5
the dish are all good especially the scallop capellini.
and super affordable wine 6$/glass. Highly recommended.

The waiter made us rush our starter just to bring out the main dish. Never made an effort to check the tables for used plates to take away.
4
Dinner at Wine and Chef was highly recommended by peers. I would recommend trying the salmon risotto for mains! I would also like to complement the service by the staff who were all knowledgeable about pairing wines with the ordered meals.
5
Love the atmosphere and definitely the food too. My favourite was the Salmon confit risotto! Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu
4
The portion of food is quite small. But yummy. The wine is good. Overall, good food good ambience. Will be back for more
5
The food was great with appropriate pricing. Service was good too, despite the busyness of the season. Will definitely come back.
5
Good service by one of the waiters. Love love the truffle fries. will definitely go back to dine agai
4
Nice Italian food with Asian twist. Food was good but quantity is small. Ambiance is suitable for friends and small group gathering. Suggest toilets could be improved to up the restaurant level
5
A absolute must come to place if you love wine (or beer). They have both in and out door seatings. They have a wide range of wine and if required, they will breathe you wine in pretty wine breather. The weather is cool during late afternoons, so good to be chilling here. Should come

Had a wine and dine diinner with 3 other friends. Made a reservation but somehow it got lost but fortunately managed to get a table when I called up the restaurant to amend the no. of people attending. Our server, Lavind (not sure if I got the spelling right) was very attentive, freindly and he happens to be the one to pick my reservation the second time I rang. Very apologetic for the minor incident when I told him about it. Had a couple of recommendations on the specials on the boardWe ordered a few appetisers - Calamari (recommended by Lavind) and fried tofu. For the mains we had pan fried Baramundi and Lamb (both specials recommended by Lavind) and old favourte pork knuckles with curry sauce. Verdict:- calamari was quite tasty with a reasonable serving size; Tofu - quite similar to adedashi tofu both in taste and serving size which is small; Lamb was gamey for me but my friends was ok with it, serving size reasonable and finally Baramundi was tasty for some and bland for other though we forgot to pour in the sauce, but serving size is small, appetizer size rather than as a main. Overall - good place for a reasonable priced wine and dine, would definitely recommend it
3
Lots of Italy wine and the price of the wine is reasonable, but the food there are just average and small portion.
4
A nice little place with easy going vibes and affordable small dishes. The food is quite innovative and wine very affordable too. Worth trying out.
5
Ask for their specials which are not on the menu, the scallops were cooked perfectly and made a great starter
5
Such very knowledgable staff that take you on a wine journey when you first arrive to ensure you select the right wine for you ! Very passionate about each wine they have and what we selected with their recommendation did not disappoint! The food was also delicious I highly recommend wine& chef what a great night!

Great service and food! Lavin, our server was fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The salad and salmon risotto was delicious and may tr

Wine & Chef provides good and affordable food and drinks. Good place to chill and hang out with friends after work

The wine bar was always packed so I expected the food to be very good. Overall they fell below expectations. Wine selection good and affordable though. Cheese... for the big plate, there was a lot of bread, and just one regular tasting portion of the cheese....Seats are way too close together.
4
There are some changes in the menu but the food is still good. It was kinda rowdy with a big group of people at the other table. But I guess that's usually the case at everywhere for a Friday
5
Food was fantastic and the wine recommendation was good. Would recommend coming here for a hearty dinner with wine.
5
I was very positively surprised how tasty each dish is and the quality of the food. Great choices of wine and reasonable prices.I will definitely be back and definitely recommend Wine & Chef

Place was really cosy. Valerie was really amazing. A group of us of 6 almost could not get our reservation as we were late for close to an hour. She make an effort to make alternative arrangements despite the reservation was released.
Thank you.

Very nice wine bar with excellent fusion and italian food. Large selection of international wines at the right price. We had a very pleasant stay.

With friends we were there for lunch. Great experience, excellent food and choice of wines. Top choice pork knuckle with curry sauce.
Taste it!

rather small table for two. pleasant waiter. service a bit disorganized, possibly due to the Friday evening crowd.although more limited than expected, the wine by glass met expectation (2 whites \ 3 red). wine by the bottle are plentiful and very reasonably priced for a restaurant.food was another story. we focused on starters (unfortunately the slicing machine was down so charcuterie was not on offer). my fries arrived first (excellent) with a good 5mn advance over my GF mussels (quite OK, unfortunately lukewarm). the foie gras was way later. hence the comment on service and was average in taste, but nothing to complain still. snails had been cooked to death and lacked both texture and taste and left in an emulsion of garlic stalks i assume and fried garlic slivers. pork belly arrived late and disappointingly lacked punch.chicken drumlets were very popular around but we did not try. many pasta dishes were also served which looked standard enough.now, the price for the starters we had or the wine by glass was very reasonable. i would recommend for wine and cheese - charcuterie among friends (although i have not seen them). but this is not for elaborate dining

Went as a party of 3 for a visitor who was looking for Western food. The best part of this restaurant is the wine. At the entryway, there are lots of wines on display that customers can select from, and at very reasonable prices -- similar/cheaper than what you can buy at the store. So to be able to have these wines without the typical restaurant markup makes this place a great value at the end of the night when you receive your bill. We enjoyed a nice U.S. / American wine for $50 -- almost unheard of for a restaurant in the central downtown area.On to the food. We really enjoyed all our plates. We went family style, and this place is really set up for that by handing out small plates. We shared the cheese platter and loved the truffle cheese, which you can order alone. The charcuterie platter also had a generous amount of truffle oil -- always a plus! These platters came with bread so can help fill up the tummy.We also shared the crabmeat pasta which I'd term fusion with its Asian flavors and Italian ingredients. The lamb shank was very tender and large -- it can certainly be shared between 2 people.One restaurant staff impressed us with his decanting skills -- they have a neat device to decant the wine quickly. Another staff seemed a little inexperienced (for example, trying to clear a non-empty plate with lots of food on it), but this was nothing big and easily fixed by a quick comment. ln summary, great food, great wine, and a very reasonable bill due to the wine prices. I'm excited about this place and look forward to returning

Italian food with an Asian twist and keeping the basics do great cooking.... the ribs are to die for with tender 48hr rib meat with burdock root or the Chinese pork slice with garlic sauce... absolutely well balanced. I love the whole menu, first time to ever say that I love a whole menu! Wines oh the wines... very interesting in house Italian range that you can't get elsewhere in Singapore and interesting mix of others at a value for money Prive (sg context). This is my new Favourite place. Take it from a singaporean

Small humble place I would say, we strolled along Keong Siak Street still thinking of wat to have for dinner. We wanted a place with good food and wine, we were still early before 6pm the sign still closed, peeked into the window of this place, flip their menu which were placed at the door. A warm and friendly gentleman welcomed us in to the place, he mentioned that they will open at 6pm. He brought us to the table served us water and handed us a set of menu and apologised to us that the chef will be ready by 6pm. Thank you for you wonderful hospitality we had a wonderful dining experience. We had chicken wings with prawn paste, Oyster omelette, Wagyu beef, prawn crackers and Azar (local peranakan salad), coffee and cup of rich dark chocolate with italian wines. Interesting taste to the palate and favourful combination of local & italian fusion

We visited with my friends and we enjoyed the selection of wines. The food also were delicious! i highly recommend the mussel, lamb, foiegras and the wagyu beef! Very attentive service by Eunice. thank you

Stumbled upon this place late one afternoon and just made the last call for the set lunch. What a great stroke of luck. The food served was excellent, very beautifully presented, tasty, well spiced, and good portion sizes. The staff was welcoming and offered advice and guidance on food and wine choices. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole service and just wished we had found it sooner. Go check it out

When you visit Singapore, some of the best new cafes, bars and cool wine bars plus restaurants are popping up in and around Chinatown.Kiang Siak Rd is a well-known hot spot!This was an excellent dinner on a steamy Equatorial nightThe Sicilian olives were delish The charcuterie platter was divine with the meats cut as thin as a slice of airThe poached peach dessert with ice cold ice cream was heavenly Well worth a visit
