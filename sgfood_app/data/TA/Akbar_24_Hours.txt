Good for fried food choices (e.g. nasi goreng, Maggie goreng, all goreng stuff). Portions are small. Food tatse is ok. Non aircon outlet. Sells mainly Indian food choices.

We needed a nearby halal restaurant while attending meetings at Shenton Way. Prices were unbelievable, food was on the better side. Authentic pakistani and Indian food. Nothing so fancy. Nothing extra ordinary. But at this price and and at this pace you can not ask for anything better. All in all life saver.

We found this place by accident while staying at M Hotel. Extremely jetlagged we were wandering around the hotel looking for something to eat at 4 a.m., except 7/11 food. Their freshly made cheese parottas with spicy gravy were surprisingly tasty, as was the omelet. We visited again one evening to discover wide selection of meat and fish curries on display (we went for parottas again). Place is frequented by local taxi drivers which is always a good sign. Prices are low to very low. Overall – very tasty, authentic Indian cheap eats in the heart of Singapore’s business district
