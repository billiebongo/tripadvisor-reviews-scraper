The dim sum served is different from the dim sum outside. They have all special selection of food. However it is pricey because of the quality of food. Good and nice please to have lunch. The service is good.

Great alacarte dinner. Well prepared cantonese cuisine worth the price. Especially liked their beef cubes and sweet and sour pork.

Bright airy dining room with tables nicely spaced. A good selection of dim sum. Some were memorable like the otak siewmay,x.o chicken feet not so. Service was attentive.

I echo the last reviewer, was simply a horrendous dining experience.Booked a private room for 13 people for lunar new year reunion dinner.Terrible food, minuscule portions, super slow service and an complete rip off and fleecing.Started off with the yusheng, lunar new year toss raw fish salad. Average, passable.Followed by a roast suckling pig. This was actually decent, not a bad version and all. However it was down hill from there. The shark fin soup was completely tasteless, it was literally pieces of shark fin and chicken in hot water. The broth was so diluted, it totally taste like water. The service was super slow, perhaps it was the eve of cny and they were understaffed and busy. But the food service slowed to a snail crawl. A dining guest had to leave half way. The scallops and asparagus course was a complete joke. The portion served to each person was like a tiny Hors derve. One scallop the size of a twenty cent coin, 2 skinny stalk of asparagus barely an inch in length.The soon hock fish portion was equally tiny, each person got not much more than could fit into a table spoon. The size of the fish could perhaps be suitable for 4 to 6 person max and there were 13 of us. Other than the tiny portions, the taste and presentation were lackluster and mediocre, and I am being generous.  We understand restaurants would charge more for the occasion of reunion dinner. But we were completely fleeced. The set was priced at $1600. We swapped out the original duck for a sucking pig and there were 13 guest instead of 10. We reminded the manager to make sure the dishes and portions were for 13 and not 10. Obviously, base on my earlier statements, this wasn’t the case. Final cost of the dinner, and we were only served water through the dinner as we brought our own wine... the final cost of the dinner was $2,800! A whole $1,200 for swapping out a duck for a suckling pig and 3 extra guest. Avoid this restaurant like the plague.

Our experience is so bad it's hard for one to believe it's true. Made reservations for a Friday night. Upon arrival we got to know they overlooked our booking. And there was already some major booking by another huge group going on. So we were made to sit in a corner table that was hastily set up for us (the table seemed to be originally intended for keeping wine bottles and such ordered by the huge group of diners). The 3rd dish took more than 1 hour to arrive after the 2nd and this was only after we had to tell them to hurry up (it was close to 930pm and we were all famished from the waiting). The noodles were brought to us cold, colder than soba and of a consistency that reminded me of chewing gum that has been chewed and spat out (maybe we offended the staff too much?). The pork was hard as rock. The final dish of the set menu was probably a joke: 4 small square slices of glutinous rice cake with no effort at presentation. When we fed back to the head staff, he told us: we have told u not to insist on dining tonight but u did. Would have lodged a complaint directly to the restaurant but realised there's no such avenue. Goes to show how little they value feedback.

Had a pre CNY dinner with some old school friends here as they were interested after hearing of my prior good experiences here. In all we had 7 courses which added up to $70 per head with a 10% discount using the Accor card. All of us were extremely satisfied with every dish.Had a false start with the fried salmon skin in salted egg yolk which was not crispy and had to be returned. Things only went uphill after we replaced the appetiser with the fried huaishan with pork floss, individual choice of soup (the four of us chose 3 hot & spicy soup and 1 corn soup both of which were delicious), the signature dish of bean skin chicken served in small crepes a la peking duck, fried dou miao with black garlic, individual servings of charcoal doufu with fresh scallop, then fish noodle with giant prawn. We had cold red bean cream and fried durian ice cream garnished with mango puree.We had the entire dining room to ourselves as it was a quiet week night so it was very conducive to our catching up. The service staff were reasonably attentive until the dessert stage, after which they disappeared entirely - no worries as we did not need anything but the bill. What was great was the absence of the 2 restaurant managers who my brother warned me about - apparently on the occasions when he dined there, the managers talked loudly to each other completely disregarding the noise disturbance to diners in the main dining room. If the managers were in that night, they could not be heard in the main dining room.We hope the standard of cooking and quality of ingredients remain high and the ambience remains as pleasant. Then we would certainly return time and again

We have had 2 delightful lunches so far - a leisurely weekday lunch for 2 in the main dining room and a lunch party on Sunday in the private room for 7. Food was refined, tasty and served at the right speed. We enjoyed the:1) dim sums - crystal dumpling with mushroom, scallop dumpling and shrimp dumpling; 2) noodles - fish noodle (intense yummy fish flavour) with an extremely fresh large prawn in a spicy sauce on the first visit and freshly made egg noodle in a pumpkin broth with a slipper lobster on the second visit; 3) seafood like bamboo clam - usually I avoid this dish as I find they tend to be overcooked and over-seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was able to taste the natural sweetness of the clam which was not rubbery at all4) melt in your mouth roast pork (siu yoke) with a lovely crispy skin5) dessert of warm almond cream with egg white was just nice to end the mealThe mostly female service staff was attentive and senior supervisor, Sammi Ow was very helpful in recommending dishes. The private dining room was extremely pleasant and our lunch party felt very relaxed and chilled indeed. We are hoping the restaurant will maintain its high standards and we look forward to dining here again in the near future

Chinese restaurants – especially Cantonese food – can be pretty much the same. But not the relatively new Song Garden at Mercure Hotel Bugis on Middle Road.First the restaurant is not very big and an interestingly elongated floor space. They do have quite a few private dining rooms; catering to this niche market I guess. It also boasts of one room which sits 26. I can imagine hosting the President of China with sophisticated flower arrangements in the middle of the huge table!I was there for dinner and then lunch over a two-week period. First time, I was very impressed with the warm and immaculate service and I “double confirmed” their service quality at the next visit.Their menu doesn’t read of a typical Cantonese restaurant. I like their pressed chicken and bean curd skin served a la Peking duck. Their stir-fried kai lan greens with black garlic – I first thought was century egg! - offers another delicious twist to a basic vegetable dish. If you like cod, they have quite a few options of cooking this silky fish. Pumpkin soup is also rather rare in a Chinese restaurant especially in a creamy puree. I first enjoyed XO mee pok (flat egg noodles) with scallops at Four Season’s Jiang Nan Chun but reckon Song’s pretty damn good too. Although we opted for fresh fruits to end the dinner, we decided to introduce our Japanese visitor to durian. Song Garden had the yummiest durian dessert which even the faint hearted would enjoy.Song Garden also innovates with their dim sum at lunch. Their siew mai is filled with otak and they offer a foie gras mini pie. Although their har gau is the same but we all felt it was extra succulent from the skin to the prawns.Song Garden’s prices are comparable to the Chinese restaurants in five-star hotels. Like I’ve said earlier, they are probably also targeting the niche private dining room crowd. But we all feel their refreshing menu, delicious food and service quality merit the price and return visits. And the whole extended family can now dine on one large table

Miss Sammi (Ow Swee Ngan) took care of me during my dinner and she was not afraid to inform the chef to cook one soup not on the menu. She is welcoming person and have very good service. I eat alone and she stayed to discuss with me. Good food, good taste and bite expensive but it s singapore. Place to come, high recommendation

The large room can easily fit 20 around a round table with a huge and automated lady Susan. Service was excellent and the food was split between modern Fusion n traditional Cantonese cuisine. Some of the dishes were disappointing such as the baked spare rib with special sauce, and prawn with Korean glass noodles. The good ones are the lobster soup and the starters. Food bill came to over 140$ per person which is on the high side. We celebrated birthday in a very comfortable and specious room
