Great Singapore style seafood. They have some excellent dishes created by their Chefs like Salt baked Flower(blue) crabs, my favourite Crystal chicken and many others.

A nice restaurant located at junction of Sembawang And Mandai road. The parking is free. The menu is different from the other eateries around the area. The price is reasonable too

Went with the Hokkien Mee with salted egg squid was a good mix. Quiet on a weekday, which was easy to get table. Definitely had the feel of a Hong Kong restaurant. Staff friendly. Will come back to try Pepper Crab

My friend bring me and my husband to this restaurants to try the Chilly Crab, the taste is really delicious and we had very warm welcomed by the Host, she is the best Host I have known.
Highly recommended!!!

This is a gem of a find for us. We came here for lunch on a weekday and we happened to stumble on it as we were in the Mandai area and wanted to find a nearby restaurant for lunch.Limited parking is available so take heed probably on weekends.The grilled chicken was introduced to us later as it is apparently not listed in the menu. Well, the presentation may shock some souls, but once you attack the food, WOW ! the meat is tasty and absolutely fabulous !Will come back in force just for this

Famous Kitchen has been known to serve good food since Thomson Road's days before they moved to Current location.Have been here many times over the years. Enjoy the food.There is a small drinking place outdoor and well patronized by the neighborhood. Very chill. And serve good pizza.

Surprised to find this Chinese restaurant open for business in the second day of Chinese New Year. We had lunch here. Menu was slightly limited though we were quite happy with the food. The herbal chicken and noodle were hot favourites. Hubby's special salted egg prawn dish was not quite what we expected especially with the shell still intact.

If you want good seafood and delicious noodles, try this place! The seafood (crabs, clams, fresh OYSTERS, fish, prawns etc.)is absolutely delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Free valet parking is also available. With nice ambience and good selection of wines and beer at the Wine Mansion located next door (these 2 establishments have a partnership), your meals here will be really enjoyable. Tucked away in the tranquility of Sembawang Road. Give it a try! Buses 167, 169 and 980 ply the route of Sembawang Road

One dish stands out in this restaurant- baked salted flower crab. The taste is somewhere between smoked and barbecued, with maximum moisture maintained. A necessary sequence is to have the bakes salted flower crab before the chilli or black pepper crab. Be prepared to be messy, but it's worth it
