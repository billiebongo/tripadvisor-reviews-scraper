This cafe is located within Viva. Food wise ok.. but limited choices. Staff is not very proactive overall ok only.

Hands down to their succulent ribs! Itâ€™s juicy and tender too! Itâ€™s not easy to cook such dish to perfection and it takes a skilled Chef to do it. And they just pulled it off! The smoked duck is another great contender.

Second visit within a month. Love the truffle fried mushrooms and ondeh ondeh cake. The mushroom soup wasn't fantastic though. Not much of mushroom taste.

A classy place to dine in especially if you're looking to hang out with friends or family. To be honest, I didn't know I would experience drinking from a wine glass & neither did I know there are non-alcoholic wines.I tried the Falcon Premium Red where it is a dark red blend of Pires & Arinto which contributes a taste of black berries with a hint of spice with a fruity dry finish. I'm sorry but I can't appreciate red wine. It tasted like a really sour berries & the smell is too strong. The restaurant even state in their menu what goes well with the wine. In this case, red meat, lamb, and veal. Would love to try the rest of the flavors (the coffee too).For starters, we had Nachos with Chicken which is good for 2. I found the next good tortilla nachos other than the one in Hard Rock outlets. Taste exactly the same!MANGO CREME BRULEE for dessert. The fruit garnish looks perfect. Especially taste good while drinking the wine. A mixture of flavors in the mouth. Need the sweetness.All in all, worth the money & really love the ambiance plus service

We had lunch here, the staff are relatively friendly but completely inflexible. Asked to swap a poached egg for scrambled eggs and they claim to have a policy to not do scrambled eggs. The food is ok but they forgot some of the items - itâ€™s always a good idea to write orders down! Compared to the Singapore market this is nowhere near good enough, which is probably why they were virtually empty at lunchtime

Beef ribs 1) sublime. Huge portion . Good for sharing . The ribs was tender and very tasty . TOPs the sides could do with less honey on the potatoes Brazen steak 2) choice and cut of beef was tender . In my opnion the aioli sauce was not a match . Would have done heaps better with a curt type of suace like a salsa or chimmichuri . However all said the beef was tender melt in the mouth !!! Salmon 3) was just meh in comparative to the beef dishes Creme brÃ»lÃ©e 4) love the texture . Nicely sweet not overbearing lot sweet . Appreciated the contrast of sweet and sour balances in this dish . Onde onde cake 5) was good surprisingly as I am not a sweet tooth person . It got the right texture and sweetness In all , don't waste time on other dishes jump Dive straight in the beef ribs and steak . Don't put much hope on the sides . Just the main protein is the star :)
