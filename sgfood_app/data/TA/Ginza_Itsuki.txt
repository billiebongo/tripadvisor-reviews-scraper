Been wanting to try this. Went for a dinner and lucky enough that there wasnâ€™t any queue. Ordered the Special Tendon. Food was good and more than enough for a person,(provided you are not a big eater). It also comes with Chawanmushi and miso soup.

I have always been put off by long queues and that's a well known fact. This time however, I made the exception at my wife's insistence and pretty much regretted it. Sitting by the alley on stools basked by the "fragrance" of a distant kitchen exhaust did nothing to whet my appetite as I buried myself in my eBook trying not to get impatient. Thankfully being just the two of us, we were given our seats before larger groups. The restaurant itself is deliberately small, with a large cooking area where diners could sit around, very much like a tempura or sushi table. This one however were two cooks with deep fryers so you can imagine how you'd smell after dinner. I'm sure they could have freed up a lot more space to accommodate more diners without creating a queue but hey, everyone has their own gimmick I guess.Food service was quick, first came the chawanmushi, which I must say, is one of the better ones in Singapore. The egg was incredibly smooth and well flavored, the gingko was well prepared so there was not even a hint of bitterness.The menu is limited - there are only two types of ten-don available. The special or the vegetarian version. I opted for the special while my wife opted for the vegetarian. What I look for when I tuck into tempura is the freshness and taste of the ingredients, the crunch of the batter and the light sauce or salt that you dip it in. This place serves it with a thick sweet sauce drizzled over it, which I felt did the food a great injustice since the flavor of the sauce soaks coats the batter and somewhat diminishes the crunchiness of the batter somewhat. The sauce doesn't penetrate all the way through so for me, I felt it clashes with the taste of the ingredients making it almost bland. Personally, I don't quite understand what the fuss is about when there are many other choices to get excellent tempura or ten-don elsewhere.......without the wait

The tendon that I had here was the best tendon that I had outside of Japan. Totally worth the price paid too (I had the special at approx SGD17 after tax). The tendons come with a small chawanmushi (this was really delicious too!) and a bowl of miso soup. There were only 2 options in the menu - the special tendon and the vegetarian tendon. The only downside would be the rather poor ventilation in the restaurant (you will end up smelling like a tendon after you finish your meal) and the frequent queues spotted outside the restaurant. Try to come at off hours such as at 11.30am or after 1.30pm to avoid long queues. Will definitely return for more if I have the chance. Must try!

Not being Japanese or ever really lived there I cannot say whether its Tendon is authentic or not but it certainly is the most tasty I have ever had.There was a queue outside when we went at 11:30am on a Saturday, but apparently there is always a queue.You see the chefs at work yourself so you know that everything is deep fried for the exact right amount of time, and it is arranged beautifully and served to you right away.You can only choose Special or Vegetarian, which I think is why their stuff is of such high standard. The portions are very generous, which is great but my thing with that is that you should only go if you are really hungry. But it is so worth the wait
5
Warning: The queue can be long so do expect to wait (on average 30 minutes or more).This smallish restaurant is easily recognized by the long queue of patrons seated along the side of the end of this building (where the restaurant is located). The long lines say it all - it must be good.There are only 2 Tendon options on the menu. Price wise, the food is really value for money - you get 2 prawns, 2 long beans, 2 chicken breast meat, mushroom, corn, egg, chawanmushi, miso soup and free flow of pickles. It is a lot of food. And the place is not designed for people to eat slowly and enjoy the place - it is really wait, get served fairly quickly, eat quickly and go. And patrons are not complaining from the long lines.Just remember that compared to the food, the drinks are relatively expensive. So if one wants to dine for S$15, just ask for water, not tea or any other drinks

The special tendon meal includes 2 prawns, two portions of chicken, and mushroom, okra, sweet potato and baby corn. Included in the set is a bowl of soup and a serving of chawanmushi. Everything tasted good. The only downside to dining here is that capacity is very limited and there are perpetually long queues outside. Fortunately there are chairs to sit on while one is waiting. The special set is very good value for money but on my next visit I would not want to order any drinks. I had a cup of hot green tea and that added $3.90++ to my tab - poor value compared to the price of the special set

I've recently experienced the best tempura experience ever! Located on Tanjong Pagar, Ginza Itsuki serves only 2 types of tempura don or rice bowl on their menu - Special and Vegetable. Of course I chose the Special! Consisting of 2 filets of chicken, 2 pieces of prawns, 2 long beans, 1 shiitake mushroom, 1 sweet corn and 1 eggplant all coated and double deep fried in astounding tempura batter goodness, this restaurant packs an explosive punch! Drizzled in succulent tendon sauce and topped with a deep fried tempura egg yolk, this restaurant definitely deserves a second (and third and fourth, you get my drift) visit! #muchlovesfromstep
4
Given that we only had 2 pax, we were ushered to our seats, beating many in the queue. There are only two menu options, the special tendon and the vegetable Tendon. The Chawanmushis that came with the tendons were fantastic, a pity the serving was a little small. Might not want to get their green tea though, it's not refillable and cost $3.80 per cup.
5
Although we arrived before noon, there was already a queue of customers sitting on stools by the wall besides the small restaurant. As we neared our turn, a staff took our orders of vegetables tempura and prawns tempura.Once seated, we were served with chawanmushi which was part of the set order and there are only two set orders available. Then, the vegetables tempura was served. The tempura items were generously portioned and piled high over Hokkaido rice. Drizzles of sauce were added over the rice and tempura items. A bottle of sauce is available on each table for customers who prefer more sauce added. Also, customers can help themselves to a container of lightly pickled vegetables.First-time customers are often surprised by the generous amount of food served. For repeat customers, many have come to appreciate the value for money and are prepared to queue for their meals. Payment terms is cash only.As the frying station is not completely enclosed at the eating counter, customers find themselves leaving the restaurant with oil fume on their clothing as a reminder of their meal. A small price to pay for a hearty meal

The reason I keep coming back to Keisuke Japanese restaurant joints are probably because of their quality. As such today, I'm craving for a nice tendon so I ordered the set meal and paid $16.35. They only have regular or vegetable. With regular, you get 2 tempura and 2 pcs of tender chicken, egg and mushroom, sweet potatoes, corns (unlike Kohaku, this corn taste like Chinese corns), miso soup and chawan mushiAltogether it's a sumptuous meal!Water and vegetable are free flow. They don't have option for multi grain rice.
5
Despite the fact that there are always long queues, this place never let you down! For less than 20 s$ u get a great combo meal!
Worth it.

Best tempura have had...I'm a tempura person and the tempura is really to die for. Will definitely recommend anyone who likes tempura.

Came on weekday 9.30pm and got a seat immediately. Sitting over counter seeing the Chef cooking is a really nice. Ordered a veg and a seafood bowl. The seafood bowl got a half boiled egg in it. Nice! Food are fresh and crispy. Lovely!
4
Bar top seats were comfortable enough but I agree with previous few reviewers about the slight oily smell which permeates through the place. Its not overpowering though so its a just a minor minus point. The queue is of course variable and can be quite long. Chairs are placed outside with complimentary cold tea.The quantity and quality were good. Rice was well done and the sauce was well balanced. Nice miso soup and chawanmushi. The onsen egg was however overdone and yolk was completely cooked.For $13.90++ its a real value for money
5
Frank disclosure - I don't eat a lot of Japanese food because it is rare to find vegetarian options. That's why I was quite excited to try this place out. This restaurant has only two options - one veg bowl and a meat one. The Veg bowl comes with rice, a special sauce and about 8 pieces of different veges fried in tempura batter. The meal set includes a soup and a savoury egg pudding of sorts. I asked for an egg separately and would recommend doing so. The food was great, very filling and definitely good value for money
5
I went there around 12. There was no queue out side, got a seat straight away. There are only two menu special or veg option. I went for special. It comes with savoury steamed egg pudding and miso soup. Chinese lettuce pickles pot is on the table as help your self. Tempra is freshly cooked front of counter. It is big volume! No complaints on food and service. Very happy! Only down side is they accept Only CASH.

Have passed by the the shop so many times but unwilling to queue for rice as I'm more of a ramen person. Anyway, you can smell the frying and tempura sauce upon stepping into the jap style decor restaurant. Not all staff are trained the jap style - super courteous and effecient. But they are alright on the whole. Rice are cooked in proper small rice cooker to maintain standard. Meat and vege are fried in separate woks. Two dons to choose from - special (chicken, prawn, egg & vege) and vegetables (vege of all sorts). Comes with miso soup, chawanmushi, mixed vege side dish. Tea is about 3plus, I suppose should be refillable.Conclusion: Big portion, affordable price, fresh ingredients, nice jap rice texture... as for the sauce... it's a very normal tempura sauce that kinda taste similar to other restaurants. Still worth going if you have the craving for tempura and jap rice

Just went back last week to check out if the standard is still good. At first impression, the service and smell appeared the same and then the truth started unravelling. All the cooking staff including the main chefs have changed and one was even pretending to be Japanese . Seated at the counter, many of us saw a junior staff arrange the fried items and as he was carrying two bowls out, the long bean from one dropped onto the floor. The chef frying the chicken saw it and instead of recalling the order, allowed them to serve it to the customers as if nothing happened. Next when the special arrived, we know it's time for either the place to replace the cooking or close down. When a place specialises in tendon and charges a premium price for it, the least you would expect is soggy cheap tasting portions of battered meat and not so fresh vegetables. Gone are the fish and squid and the portion of rice have been almost halved. Worse, that same junior staff started hurrying customers out when the bowl is empty. It is simply no justice for the queue of people who pay good money to eat. What was once an enjoyable experience which saw a return visit within a few days after the first taste is now but a distant memory and full of regret.

Went with my friends to this restaurant, They have only two option, special and vegetarian. Overall budget $20 per person. A little expensive, but worth the price. The air conditioning in the restaurant is bad though. You will leave the restaurant with oily smells at your shir

The first encounter was very good when visited in dec16. The second time in jan17 was equally good. The staff were friendly and helpful. Food is very good. Only two choices in the menu, pure vegetable tempura or mixed tempura which is a combination of prawns, chicken fillet, sweet potato, Long beans, mushroom and poached egg. Plus a small cup of steamed egg. Very good deal set at 13.90 sgd. Cash payment only. The not so nice part of the dining experience is that their music is too loud..... feedback to them and they can't do anything about it as they said their management wants it this loud..... Warning- the drinks of green tea, coke and Coke Zero are all priced at 3.80 sgd. that is all in their drink list when the server offered. Cash payment only..... reminder......
4
The queue was worth waiting, small cosy place where you see the chef prepare the food. Had a good meal with wifey.
5
OMG! I cannot rave enough about this place. My boyfriend introduced this to me last year and I'm hooked. They only have two things on their menu and that is more than enough to satisfy any customer. That tempura assembly line is an art. I enjoy watching the chefs as much as eating the food. Always worth the wait and worth every cent.Favorite
5
Every time we walked past this place there was a line, so one night as we were walking past about 940pm we decided to stop in and see if they would still let us in. Luckily enough they did and we were so amazed. Great value meal and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend either getting there late or early as theres always a line.

Ginza Tendon Itzuki is definitely a "MUST VISIT!"What the menu offers is TEMPURA. only. and it is PERFECT !!The exterior is humble, and easy to pass on by, as I did the first visit there. The interior is subdued, cozy, almost intimate, as it is rather small-- yet almost always full ! I specifically chose to eat there close to closing time, to avoid the wait for sitting space. I was justly rewarded--with seat, service, and Tempura to LIVE for! There is Tempura with prawns... and there is veggie only Tempura. I always choose veggie only, and have always LOVED it !!  The price is a little much, yet is not at all, as the serving looks a little small, yet is ample! A place of contradictions ha ha ha-- This is a place to returnto-- MANY times over, as I do, and will continue to do, each time I visit Singapore ! Try it, and you too will be a patron

There was always queue outside of this Restuarant. The chawamushi is great. Love the seaweed onto of the steam egg.  Shop closed at 3 pm. So come early. The portion is a bit large for me for lunch. There are only 2 types vegetables or special. Special tempura consists of prawns, fish and vegetables (Long beans, mushroom,corn and brinjal). All serve with Japanese rice.
4
Pros:- you must try if you like tempura- the food served fast- the price is ok at 13.90 sgd you got a bowl of tempura with rice, chawamushi and miso soup. The size of tempura bowl is pretty big- authentic feel of japanese restaurant. Cons:- they only serve 2 food here: mixed tempura and vegetable tempura. nothing else!- the restaurant is very small and can easily packed with people. Try to come early to avoid large queue.- they only accept cash- not suitable to bring very young kids. The place is very small. Not sure if they have kids chair. You can contact them on that- not a good place to bring very large crowd of people because of limited space- they charge green tea for 4 sgd if im not mistaken. Water is fre

No queue for dinner at 9pm! DELICIOUS tempura, the tendon special has prawn, chicken, green bean, fish, and runny egg yolk tempura (and possibly one or two more). Very good value set with miso and chawanmushi, and all you can eat Japanese salad. Super satisfying, and will be returning to try the vegetarian tendon
4
Food is great with crispy batter and fresh vegs and shrimp. The portion is large and the flavor is just nice. However, the atmosphere is too rush for those who wanna have a relaxing meal with friends or family. The music is so tense with rapid beating, which is just like screaming "finish your meals faster and get out
4
Find the tempura went done, miso soup tasty though chawamushi could be heated a bit longer to bring justice to the visually appealing bowl. Find the tea overpriced at $3.8++ per cup. Perhaps owner can consider changing the cut of two pieces of chicken breast/fillets to one piece of thigh meat which will perhaps add value to the deal and permit customers to finish everything in the bowl. The portion is big

This eatery has been unfairly blamed for three things:1. Soggy tempura - it is cooked right in front of the customers based on their orders. As fresh as it gets in light of the hot and humid weather in Singapore. 2. Smell in the dining area - the shop is small so the food smell takes time to be removed despite two vertically installed vent right above the deep fryers. But one man's smell is another man's aroma and it is quite common for a tempura store, not pungent or repulsive at all. U get much worse smell at any food court in Singapore.3. The drinks are expensive - Yes but there is free ice or warm water available. Also, there is free Japanese tea outside the store while u r waiting.The queue could be long if u r not prepared. But if u show up at 11am for the store to open at 11:30am, then u wait maximum 30 min. Also, the service by the local Singaporean ladies is good. Most of all, the food is good, the quantity is more than sufficient and the price is very reasonable by Singapore standard. It is no wonder that the queue is forming early despite some of the negative reviews
5
Had tried a few, this is still the best in sg. Value for money.
Only 2 types, special and vegetable.
Special comes with fish n chicken.
Long q always.
Cons: Only the smell in the premises.
Hope the management can improve on this.

It's the cheapest tempura you can find. Two prawns, two chicken fillet, baby corn, sweet potato tempura in rice for $13.90.
But batter was soft and damp. Food had no taste.
Don't be fooled by the queue. It's a 20 seater restaurant.
4
Great meal, almost like what you could find in Japan. Except chicken is a bit chucky and dry.
Nice atmosphere inside. And in true Japanese style , only 2 types of choices here.
5
Wonderful place with nice food. The choice in the restaurant in not huge and consists of a couple of sets. But the atmosphere inside and the taste are so nice that it worth to queue for 40 minutes at the entrance.
4
For only $13.90, this is such a great value for a tendon meal, complete with miso soup and chawanmushi. The intimate counter seats adds to the experience as you get to see all the frying action live. My only gripe was that the chefs would drizzle the sauce all over the tempura and for a slow eater like myself, this would mean soggy tempura towards the end. Still tasty though
5
For only SGD12, you'll get to experience the hearties Tendon meal you can ever find. Generous serving of quality meat and vegetables, crunchiness and freshness in every bite, it took me days to stop thinking about this yummylicious food. However, the wait was indeed very long, took me about 1-2 hours for it, but those in line were taken care off. With free flow of tea for your dispense. Thumbs up
3
This time I went at a wrong time and the queue was so long. Waited an hour for my tendon. But it was worth the wait. Both the special and vegetable tendon were good. Just one downside, the chicken meat in the special tendon was rather dry and bland. I will suggest order both for sharing. As the restaurant is small, it is best to go with just a friend or alone
5
No better Ten-don place in Singapore that replicates the dish as good as it is in Japan. No complexity in orders, just a choice of 2 options (veg or special don). Ingredients are aplenty with chicken breast slices, prawns, fish, vegetables and even an egg.Sauce is delish and service is friendly. Will definitely return
5
Just order the special as you queue (unless you are vegetarian). This huge bowl is very fulfilling meal, as it comes as a set with a bowl of soup and chawanmushi, plus a self-service salads. Expect to queue and estimate each turn of sitting is around 25-30min. Service is incredibly fast and efficient, and each staffs are warm and friendly. And the price is amazing, thus the long queue
4
This big bowl of tendon will remain in your mind for a very long time.They restaurant is very generous with the tempura and the egg is so good when mixed in with the rice!Only con is the ventilation. You will really walk out smelling like tempura. So make sure you are not going anywhere fancy after this meal
5
Amazing food and setting. Waited for 50 minutes in queue to get in the restorant. But it was worth it! We were sitting just in front of chef. Only 2 options in menu. Both super delicious and very big portions.

The outlet is another Japanese restaurant by Ramen Keisuke.One could smell the strong sesame oil even before stepping into the outlet. The kitchen hood exhaust system did not seem to work. Ventilation was poor. There is only 2 choices on the menu : Special Tendon ($13.90) or Vegetable Tendon ($12.90).It was a 20 minute wait before being showed to a counter seat. Help yourself to the iced water while waiting.Special TENDON (Tempura on Rice) ($13.90++)2 pieces of prawn, 2 pieces of chicken, half-boiled egg, 4 pieces of vegetables (long beans, pumpkin, Shimeji mushrooms)Served with chawamushi, miso soup, and complimentary pickled vegetables.The tempura was not as crispy and light as I preferred, especially for the chicken tempura which I felt was a bit dry and tough. Not wonder the female sitting next to me, requested it to be replaced with eggplant tempura which looked much better.One really stunk very badly after eating a meal in there
5
Outside feels like Tanjong Pagar (it is) but step in and, with the first mouthful, you are transported to Tokyo. Just better. Yes, the tendon here is better than the ones I had in Tokyo. The rice bowl is literally overflowing with mixed tempura, each perfectly fried with just right amount of batter. This place is generous with their ingredients. Everything is fresh. The sauce does not overpower; it acts as a wonderful accompaniment to the rice and tempura. The chawanmushi is one of the smoothest I've tried. Every single part of this meal brings joy. I really do love a place that takes pride in what they do. Cook one dish and do it really well. Serve it without fuss, quickly, and with great service. Your customer will come back again and again. Tip: there is almost always a line but it moves rather fast. This is a cash only restaurant. Sit at the counter to see the action.
5
I love this place! Food is prepared in front of you. This place is pretty popular and people queue just to get in. The wait is worth it.Note that they only accept cash and the place is really small. If you come in a group, you might eat on separate tables
5
Heaping bowl of well-prepared tendon. Counter seating enhances the experience. There are only two kinds of tempura dishes available-- special or vegetarian. (The 'special contains two fillets of tempura chicken, two large prawns, one egg, battered and fried eggplant, beans, mushroom). The set with chawanmushi and green tea is 21.30SGD. Highly recommended for returns
5
Generous portion for the price. The set comes with chawanmushi (steam egg) and miso soup and help-yourself pickled vegetables. The sauce goes well with everything in the bowl that we emptied it and asked for re-fill. Cosy place and please forget about the smell after meal. Prepare cash for payment. Just perfect
3
The special tendon is good value for money.It feels so because there is tempura left in the bowl after eating up all the rice! I found it hard to enjoy the special rice bowl because it was quite warm, stuffy with a greasy smell in the restaurant. The restaurant does not take reservations, you will be shown in when all your guests have joined the queue and there are seats available. Please bring cash and a change of shirt should you have an appointment after the meal
5
There are only two items on offer: the vegetarian tempura set at $12.90++ and the non-vegetarian temperu set at $13.90++. One can help himself to the free salad on the table. As for the non-vegetarian set, there is much to eat, the price is certainly very reasonable. The taste of the food is very good , just like those in Japan. We arrived at 11.20 am on a weekday and there were four people in the queue. Strongly recommended
5
Came here with a friend under her recommendation. We arrived at about 1150am and got a counter seat fairly quickly. As with other reviews, you can expect to stink up and walk out smelling like tempura, so be sure to use their freshener at the door or make sure that you have a way to do so, back at the ofc, if u r going at lunch. The food is good. Only two choices, special or veggies only. We took special at just $13.90++. The veggies only is cheaper by a dollar. The special is loaded with chicken, prawn, green beans and runny onsen egg all coated with the tempura batter. The batter isn't the usual crispy crunchy style tempura though. Its not exactly soggy but it definitely wasn't crunchy. I dunno if it is because the server spends some time to arrange the elements and thus loses the crunch, or if it is due to the sauce dizzled over the tempura items. However, yummy and very filling. The shop uses authentic jap shortgrain rice. If u wish to tapao the cooked rice since there is usually alot of it in the Bowl, do bring ur own container.

The first thing that hits you when you enter the small restaurant is the smell! It's an open kitchen so food is prepared in front of you. If you are heading somewhere after the meal, I would suggest don't. Select this place if you intend to head straight home after...The food I must say is excellent, and for the quality and quantity it is a great value for your money. Simple menu (just two choices for food).The tea is really expensive in comparison to the food - $3.80, about a third of the price of the Special set I ordered, and that is before the taxes. I'm confused if you ask me to rate if this is cheap eat...but technically, it is cheap eating here...but the tea for such a joint is far too expensiveGo for warm water if you agree with me that the tea is expensive - they don't charge for warm water
