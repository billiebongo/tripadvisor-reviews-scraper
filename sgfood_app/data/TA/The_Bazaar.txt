We picked this place for our Saturday lunch out on East Coast Road. The food was tasty and very healthy. The portion sizes was large. We loved the papri chaat.
Our experience would be better if the decor and ambience could be improved.

We had a delicious dinner at this restaurant last week. Delicious food, generous portions and good price! Friendly staff too! Butter chicken is superb! Recommended!

Very good and clean!
The price is litlle bit higher but it have very nice food!
was 2 persons!
The staff very good!

Unassuming little warm place in katong, the bazaar is a colorful restaurant that serves delicious north indian cuisine. We shared a tandoori platter, a palak paneer, some cheese naan and mango lassi. Reasonably priced, good service and happy tummies!
5
I love their Indian chicken briyani and raita!!... generous portion, I can eat it all myself though..haha!
Butter chicken also very nice, and the papadum with it's dip.
I think their briyani is the best so far that I couldn't find it anywhere else.
5
Awesome food.
Loved chicken curry, butter naan and malai kulfi.
So far, best option in area.
Awesomely priced. Great value for money.
5
Bright clean restaurant with speedy service. Papadum and water was served to us once we sat. Tasty butter chicken and mutton dishes. Definitely will return!

The Bazaar has colourful decor, a very cheery ambiance, and an extensive menu with some interesting Indian dishes you don't see too often. One such that caught our fancy was the Bagara Baingan, which we ordered along with Shahi Paneer, Tandoori Butter Roti, & Aloo Paratha. We also had a beer and a house pour (Australian Riesling) to drink. The wine was flat and was obviously from an opened bottle. I brought that up and it was replaced with a crisp version from a newly opened bottle - brownie points for the service! The food was fair - the eggplant was truly delicious and the breads were well made. The Paneer was a huge disappointment - tasted like cottage cheese in a chunky, poorly made tomato soup. However, I would still recommend everything else
5
Tried 2 other restaurants near by that wasn't that good came to The Bazaar and was hooked. I have ate there everyday unless having dinner with people. Cheese Kulcha is amazing the prices are a little higher than other Indian restaurants but the amount of food, customer service that you get is worth paying a little extra. This my new goto restaurant
5
Our family went to The Bazaar based on the positive TA reviews and agree that the food is delicious. We were very grateful of how accommodating the people were. We did not want to eat while hearing a radio music station in the background. We asked them to turn the music down and they ended up turning off the music entirely. We were able to eat in peace and enjoy the food. In particular, we loved the butter chicken, dal, panac paneer, cumin basmati rice, and mango lassi. It's a vibrant location too with lots of shophouses. We enjoyed our experience and will go back there before we leave Singapore
5
Wonderful place for eating quality Indian food..must visit place in Singapore, staff is curtious n nice..food is out of this world ..thanks to chef n staff...keep it up.
4
I have always loved indian food. The food here is tasty and fragrant. I had a masala tea, paneer, tika masala chicken :)
5
Oh WOW the Papdi Chaat which was given to us complementary was soooo lovely!! And that was just the start! I have had food delivered from here and eaten in the restaurant a few times now. The portions are generous, the Goan Prawn Curry is delicious with 6 massive prawns which we shared between 3 people along with the bindhi masala (Okra or Ladies fingers) Sooo delicious.Lovely staff and two for one on the Kingfisher bottled beer! What more do you want? See you soon
5
We checked out the reviews and decided to try this quaint little restaurant in the east one night. Friendly staff, colorful ambiance and great food all in all! we loved the papri chaat, samosa, butter chicken and dal makhani. The mango lassi was good too. Highly recommended!Â
2
Visited The Bazaar after reading a few reviews. I think the staff is new as our waitress seemed a little inexperienced while communicating. Nevertheless, the food was just above average, nothing fancy in terms of presentation, however. Other people chatter was somehow distracting and the music was a little off theme. I told the staff about this, and they replied that Indian music is played upstairs. Not too heavy on the wallet, so can give it a try
4
I found this place near my hotel holiday inn express, katong Singapore. To my surprise authentic Indian food with super taste. They serve more of North Indian cuisines beginning from dum Biryani to lacha paratha, dal to paneer butter masala. The kids menu is a life savior because it has noodles added and moreover you can order per your appetite.
5
I live nearby and this is our favourite Indian to visit with my family or get delivery from. As the ambiance and branding are quite tacky/plasticy we rarely take overseas guests here but the food is great. Portions are good, swift service and tasty dishes. There are a few dishes on the menu that you don't find in most Indian restaurants so worth exploring beyond your goto dishes
5
Visited here last night - what a fantastic place!Ambiance excellent - quick and efficient service and very attentive - popadoms served within a minute of sitting down - waiter was excellent out water glasses were constantly topped up without having to even ask!We had a selection of starters and masala chips (to die for!) presentation was excellent and service faultless.For mains we shared the non vegetarian platter a selection of meat and fish kebabs that were utterly divine (see pictures) without doubt some of the best food we have had in our two months in Singapore!Wife had a chocolate milkshake that was again superb and excellent value at less than six dollars whilst I had a lovely masala tea.Upon being presented with the bill I noticed they had massively undercharges us having not billed us for the main course - normally I'd have simply paid and walked out but the food was so good, coupled with the attentive service I could not normally do this so brought it to their attention - total bilk came to 52 sg dollars which I felt was excellent value given the high quality of the ingredients!!We couldn't finish all our food as the portions sizes were very good - they even offered to wrap the remaining food up to take away with us which I feel was a very nice touch.I wish i could give them six stars so happy were we with the meal - if you are in the area you would be silly to miss out on such quality!!
5
I found this restaurant, well rated on Tripadvisor, just across the road from my hotel. While the eat-in area was small, there were enough tables for that time of day. The menu was varied, and I asked for recommendations to suit my dietary requirements. The food was very tasty, fresh and the serving size was just right. There were lots of takeaway orders prepared during my time there, but they were very efficient with my order as well. Good value for money as well
5
We ate here as a couple and we're very impressed with the food. Excellent samosas & vegetarian curries with plenty and I mean PLENTY of spice if you want! Large portions in addition to excellent food with a 241 beer happy hour, what's not to like
5
More of a takeout place than a dine in.
Excellent indian food at good prices.
The kathi rolls and biriyani is a must try.
5
This Indian restaurant was amazing - great food, plenty of options, fantastic service and possibly the best mango lassi I've ever had in my life. Definite recommend if you're looking to eat Indian!
5
We popped in for a quick round of kebabs and curries and weren't dissappointed. Fast and efficient service, great flavours, we had 2 curries and a tandoori platter, an amazing mango lassi and it was reasonably priced. Highly recommended.
5
Excellent food and service. The best authentic Indian food in Singapore. Reasonably priced, brilliant chef and prompt service. Highly recommend it, did not disappoint my taste buds.
5
We visited this as it was just over the road from our hotel. It did not disappoint and we had a lovely curry, you can choose the level of spice so it's fresh and to order. Fully recommend.
4
We have been here every time we staying in Bangkok and we are never dissapointed by the food or service, Only negative point is the so expensive menu. Just around the corner you can get same quality of food for the half price.Anyway, I will return next time again :
5
This is my 2nd visit to this place very pleasing ambience , and highly courteous staff , service standards are mostly on the Indian concept of atithi devo bhava , food is really very good in taste and presentation value for money 1 portion of food is good for two people . I would like to recommend pardah biryani it's really very good and yes samosa are also excellent .
4
I ordered a take out from this restaurant.. when I called in, and asked the person on phone for options , I liked that on a busy evening he explained why some of my choices were not appropriate and suggested others .. .. I ultimately ended up ordering papdi chaat and a paneer tikka wrap . The chaat was excellent but the tikka wrap had got soggy by the time I came around to eating it - so will have to try it again some other time When I picked up the food - they had my exact change ready as well . A pleasant experience overall and worth a revisit for more of it

There are two reasons for not going all of the way to a one star 1. The vegetarian poppers were great - the thin fried empty dough she'll with the delicious cold broth that goes inside and you pop in your mouth - awesome2. We ordered delivery via uber eats and the driver was paper, but not all, of the problem.The food was an hour late.The tandoori chicken didn't have that trademark red coloring, and there was a lemon flavor - The chicken may have been affected by the citric acid, but it was dry and didn't taste right. Not off, just not good or like anything you would expect.The bindi (okra) dish was ok but the driver dumped all of the liquid out of the container when he squeezed the bag out of the delivery box - he was too lazy/stupid to to take the time to completely open up the delivery box and take the bag out, he literally unzipped halfway and then squeezed it out while I watched, slack jawed.They missed the raita, order never came through.The lamb curry wasn't horrible but there was a very thick layer of oil on top, probably like 10% of the container. It made for a very oily curry.The garlic naan was goodWe tried the rice with curd and spices - we both hated it, but I don't know if the dish was done properly - it may be a specific thing that you grow up eating/is regional.We did the aloo gobi and it was decent, but not something I would look forward to (it's my favorite Indian dish)In short, the only thing I can say about the Bazaar is that it is very bizarre the establishment has remained open as long as it has
4
Visited this place for my mum's b'day dinner. Hosted in a small, unpretentious room, this restaurant boasts of a personal touch, a great ambience to have family dinners. The service is prompt and the people (I am not sure if they are the owners) are exceptionally sweet and accommodating. The food tastes fresh and sober, pretty much like home food.Overall, a good experience
5
Delicious and generous selection of curries in this unpretentious restaurant. Normally dishes of curry are fairly small, but these are good sizes, and one can easily feed 2. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!
5
We ordered three portions of this particular item after we couldn't stop wiping it off in a flash. V good kids menu my son loved the shorba. Will def be back again! Good work guys!
3
Not bad food. Not great either. Too much tomato sauce or paste in their curry sauce. Wouldn't go back.
4
Very good Indian food at a very fair price. Service is good and staff are most helpful.
Looks very small as you enter but they also have seating upstairs. I'd say the best Indian food on East coast of Singapore.
5
i just want to warn everybody who loves indian food that the food they serve is totally awesome! this is the best indian food i've ever tried. i love the way they cooked and prepared the biryani. good customer service and the staff are very friendly. i will definitely recommend this place for my friends for them to try
4
Service staff were friendly and the food was good. Most of the food is not spicy, which is good for those who cannot take spicy food. The food is creamy and they use lots of yoghurt in their cooking. Not recommended for those who are lactose intolerant
5
The Bazaar has been very consistent. The food is very good and authentic. And it is a great value for money. It is a small place and make reservation before you go. Take away is also an option. Set lunch is very good and price is reasonable. There are several options from a la carte to choose from and will not single out any one but try different things over time.
5
My partner and I came here because of the good ratings and we made the right choice. The restaurant was small (only 6 tables), but in terms of service, cleanliness and food everything was satisfactory. Food came very fast and we over-stuffed ourselves with Butter Chicken, Yellow Tadka Dhal and Mutton Dum Briyani with no regrets. None of these dishes was spicy. The portion was pretty big for each dishes. They served wine too. Recommended!
5
I've been to this restaurant a number of times this trip, and I haven't been disappointed yet. The food tastes great, and the menu includes some vegan-friendly options. The restaurant is nice and clean, and the staff is friendly. They also offer you free pappadams and free water, which is a lot more than I can say for the competition down the road. I'll definitely be back some more times before I have to return home
4
Billy no mates on a business trip to Singas & eating alone, The Bazaar is right on the main East Coast Road drag and not quite as imposing as the very fishy eyed picture would suggest, the place is pretty damn bijou, 20 - 25 covers tops, service was friendly and efficient & even when it filled up there was no pressure from the staff to vacate & oh yes the food, standard Indian fair, good portions, well marinated ...Garlic Naan was straight out the tandoor & absolutely top notch ... I had starter & main and ate too much!! Prices were fair
4
the food was good, but going by the reviews i was expecting amazingthe Naan bread was fresh and tasty, but the chicken dish was uneventful, not bad, I was just hoping for more depth in the flavours.having to buy the rice for $4.50 to go with your curry was a bit expensive i thought
4
The place is very reasonably priced for what you get. Not being Indian myself we managed to hugely over order on the dishes and it was still incredibly cheap and we only finished half the food. I'm not vegetarian however there are loads of vegetarian options and I realized selected mostly vegetarian apart from butter chicken. The wine selection is limited however they allow you to bring your own wine which is good. I would visit again
5
Only went here as I read other reviews about this place and it didn't disappoint me. We ate the chicken vindaloo which wasn't spicy but great taste, fish curry, saag aloo and a recommended onion dish as they didn't do onion Bhaji's, lots of nann. I walked away with a mouthful of flavours and was very satisfied. Good value for Singapore dollar not bad at all. SG$99.00 with a few beers too. 3 people
5
We are regulars a this humble little joint. Its clean and colorful. But, the food is fantastic. We keep returning to try different items from their menu. Made fresh, they serve huge portions and are reasonably priced for the fine dining quality of food on offer. Definitely not greasy Indian food drowned in spices. (Now, if only they'd play Indian music to boot)
4
This place has mostly everything to offer if you are missing Indian food. Although its a small restaurant but the service is good and even the ambience is clean and especially one can find the hangings/decorations on the wall typical to the Indian restaurants :) The prices are reasonable and staff is quite friendly. Very close to east coast park so if you are on the way you can full ur stomach and then walk along the coast ! :
5
Good choice of items, all freshly prepared, with portions larger than many Indian restaurants. We were a couple who ordered two dishes, rice, naan, two beer and all for under S$ 50 including tax and service. A very good meal and good value
4
This place has serves good variety of Indian tandoor and seafood dishes. The ambience is also very neat and clean. I was happy to see some egg varieties which is not common in Singapore for Indian restaurants
4
Right opposite 112 Katong mall this restaurant serves indian Snacks and meals .had meals there food was tasty helping good .All vegetarian main dishes are priced between 10 and 15 dollars and Indian breads are priced between 2 and 5 dollars.
3
After some of the rave reviews we expected something better. The curries were nothing special, most seemed to be a reheated sauce with various meat chunks added late in the cook process so there were not infused with the flavour - only coated.With the huge choice of Indian restaurants in Singapore I'm not rushing bac
5
Airconditioned...Nice!  Not busy for a sunday.  Walked right in.  Staff is friendly.  Only seat 20 people in the restaurant.  I sat down and the place filled up!Thay also have a bustling take out business.I had to ask about some of the dishes.  They are helpful. Note: they have a chilli challenge.  Be careful!Samosas are fresh, vegi and a bit spicey.  It will stay with you.  The crust is a little tough, but good.Food is very good, but they forgot the rice - lolButter chicken and garlic Naan are great.  The Naan has a subtle smokey flavor
5
At the entrance of this place you will find all these printouts from TripAdvisor and other sights about this restaurant. They all are good reviews, and I am happy to add another one. The restaurant is quite small, but keep in mind that there is more seating upstairs.The whole downstairs seating room is decorated very simply and nicely with cloth. One thing to keep in mind is that this place starts more or less filling up after nine pm.  The service was fast and efficient, with the smiling server taking our orders politely. The bonus point is that there is free papad over here! If you have young kids, this place has a small kids menu so that they will not feel excluded. Out of everything we ordered, what really stood out were the butter naans. They were in an odd, long shape and the serving size was big. The price was very reasonable, considering the size. The unique thing about the naans was that they were covered in clarified butter, which I have not seen done anywhere else.  In the end, this place is worth a visit,only on the basis of the naans even. You will not be disappointed with them
2
The ambience is just dead..it looks like a downtown cafe. The food was average..but pricey when you look at the quantity. I really failed to see anything good or unique on the menu. May the place is good for take aways given the hard chairs and dead table
4
Good Indian food (if you do not compare it to Indian food in India) at a good price. Restaurant has kid's menu with fusion food - Indian style noodles (chowmein), tandoori tikka pizza et al
4
Excellent quality food at reasonable cost. Good smiling service. We loved the spicy and the overall food taste as well as the kulfi ice-cream. Only down side is the hotel may be full during peak dinner time
5
Excellent Indian food. Nondescript shopfront, down to earth decor but the food is amongst the best in Singapore. And, it is great value for money to boot! A great find indee
5
Simply irresistible, food is great staff friendly and fair prices. Seating is casual and nothing snobby about this place.
5
Such delicious food and the staff was so thoughtful and lovely. My husband and I enjoyed the tomato soup and paneer tikka pizza (both amazingly good) plus a wonderful cup of masala chai and mango lassi at the end of the meal. I cannot say enough about the overall high quality of the food (super fresh-tasting) and the terrific staff. We'll definitely visit again
5
Just what we wanted, good India food cooked well and served with a smile. Reasonable selection of wine and all very clean...
5
An a regular at the bazaar, have been for the past 1 year. The staff are always warm and welcoming. Love their pindi channa, biryani and masala tea! The food is authentic and the price reasonable. Highly recommende
4
Very casual, friendly service and fantastic food. Good traditional food at excellent prices. A great menu with a diverse vegetarian offering. Highly recommended
4
This is our first visit to Bazaar, but may not be the last. Food was was good. Especially the garlic naan and the lamb Gosht. Cheap beer is also worth a mention. Worth a visit!
4
We were in Singapore for summer vacation. having a great desire for Indian food,we went to The Bazaar after checking on trip adviser. The restaurant simply made our vacation. We enjoyed the curries and the garlic naan especially. i highly recommend people try this restaurant because its simply the best!!
4
Excellent and authentic Indian food. The decor is very simple so you are really going there for the food. The dal, kebab platter and butter chicken are amongst the best in Singapore. The rogan josh was disappointing, though. Portions are very generous and its great value for money. A great find
4
Resturant is nice.Food is delicious..Daal makhani is best ever..Location is little problem. Courtesy of starter papad really stand out
5
On our recent visit to singapore, we decided to try the Bazaar after reading favourable reviews here. After 3 days of sandwiches, thai and japanese, we were craving good north indian food and the bazaar hit the spot. The food was outstanding! Especially the black dal and methi mattar curry. Service was polite and warm. Highly recommended
1
Last week we just went to dine in the bazaar, after trusting the reviews on trip advisor.But totally disappointed with the late service of food and the answer recieved by the server,it's unexpected.Food was good but we cud n't enjoyed together.Service was like hawker center.overall experience was not enjoyable
5
Went in lieu to try good Indian food and this place goes all thums up in every perspective from ambience to service
5
We had a tasty, well served meal at The Bazaar. The food was delicious and well priced. The restaurant is air conditioned and kid friendly. We hope to be back soon
5
Amazing food and lovely staff. Probably the best garlic naan ive ever tasted. well worth the visit if you are here..
4
After reading the reviews and with other Indian restaurants in the area getting very expensive for average food we had to try Bazaar and wasn't disappointed. Both food and service was excellent and the 8% Kingfishers really topped it off. Will be back.
4
The Bazaar is for you ,if searching for an Indian taste in SG.The service was little slow ,but food quality is awesome.Food Quality : 4.5/5Service :3.5/
5
My wife and i enjoyed eating here greatly. We have travelled around the malay peninsular and also in comparison with Australian restaurants, believe this to be some of the finest tandoori chicken we have come across yet.The currys were delicious too and it was very well priced. I doubt anyone would be disappointed here.The pleasant staff were a great credit to the nice food as well
5
Well, where should i start... During my two months long trip, me and one of my Omani friend were regular visitors.The authentic taste of real Indian food, with the simplicity of the place and warmth of the people serving us made it a never boring experience. The staff were really helpful and even delivered us food many a times at Roxy hotel. All the people deserve an applause for the warmth with which they served us. Thank you for making every visit a wonderful one.P.S.: If you remember us, my friend was the one who ordered butter chicken everytime without looking at menu,and I use to scroll it (menu) for twenty minutes... :
5
My wife & I recently moved to this neighbourhood. As Indians, we crave for good, authentic & simple Indian food. We found The Bazaar on a leisure evening walk. Its easy to miss as the place does not visually stand out among the many small eateries in Katong.We were nervous the first time we tried because it was a rather quiet place. However all that changed when the food arrived. For a vegetarian like us, the options here are plenty. The appetisers are rustic and mildly flavoured and not spicy. The main course dishes speak freshness of the ingredients, the simple flavours and the experience one associates with home made indian food. Their breads are always hot & nicely done. We've also tried their vegetarian biryani which is a nice medley of vegetables & rice.Since then, we've been there multiple times. The food has never disappointed. The staff are probably one of the sweetest & polite you'll find among Indian Restaurants in Singapore where otherwise you'll find grumpy men & women who are disinterested in serving you. Definitely recommend for a meal with family in a relaxed environment. If you are walking past, don't fall for the small seating arrangement on Level 1. They have space on Level 2 as well
5
We are regulars at Bazaar, having discovered it soon after it opened a couple of years ago. The food is always delicicious with appropriately complex flavours. Never greasy, a problem with many Indian restaurants. The excellence of the food is matched by the welcoming and professional staff. We have enjoyed northern Indian food in many restaurants all over. The Bazaar ranks with the best! And quite reasonably priced.It's a relatively simple and small place, scrupulously clean, cheery and bright. Not fancy. Highly recommend
4
singapore is not only a fine city, but expensive-lah, hence also threats somewhere outside the tourist areas have their price.the bazaar is in katong a new upcoming area.clean place, small thoughwe got a table and food was served quicklymanga-lasso was god and hara bara khabab excellent.we had butter chicken, prawn masala and naarn, all top and served friendly and quickly.would recommend it anytim
5
An EX- ITC Chef dishing out the most authentic north indian cuisine in a difficult market... The ever smiling and accomodating service of Prakash and the indian lady makes this place very welcoming !!My tip - Dont go by the size or layout of the space.. take your chances and try out "indian" indian food for once instead of "malaysian" indian food !!A must go for every one who is an Indian at heart and for everyone who loves some spice !
5
The menu at this venue is extensive and caters to both carnivores and vegetarians. Having sampled an assortment of both on a number of occasions it's fair to say that the quality has been top notch every time! Highly recommended!
5
Bazaar is an Indian restaurant in Katong, the neighborhood I have been living in for the past 1.5 years. I cannot resist Indian food having travelled the sub-continent for 2 years. I can honestly say that the food served in Bazaar is amongst the best Indian food I have eaten anywhere in the world. Whether veg or non-veg it is authentic and always served with a smile. Portions are generous and excellent value for money. The staff are incredible. They have taked such good care of me over the past months. I am leaving Singapore tonight and returning to the UK...I just wish I could wrap this restaurant and its team up, pop them in my suitcase and take them with me! I will miss them all...and their food! Don't miss the Goan prawn curry and the saag aloo. Or the dhal. Or the butter chicken. Or anything really. Eat your way through the menu - you won't be disappointed!I wish them much continued success...they deserve it
4
Though i don't feel like eating Indian food in Singapore very often, my visit to Bazaar seems to have increased my cravings for mutton biryani and butter chicken. Out of all the things served there, mutton biryani is my absolute favourite. The meat is tender and the rice perfectly flavorful. A definite must try for people craving north indian food
5
This is a great place for an Indian meal. Not too expensive, and absolutely amazing authentic food. Try the butter chicken and tadka daal
5
I went to this restaurant recently with a few friends, each of us with some sort of request (dairy free, not too spicy, no coriander...), quite challenging for an Indian place! The waitress was understanding, patient and helpful, and we ended up having one of the best meals I tasted in Singapore. We'll go back
5
We are vegetarians and were looking for a nice Indian restaurant where we as a family can enjoy a meal. This place was worth it....service was prompt, staff served with warmth, food was delicious and ample variety to choose from...my kids loved this experience. .
5
Great food. Great Service. Awesome Experience. Will be back again for sure. Good ambience. Interior was great
5
" This place is very good. I tried their food at a friend's party and came back to dine in. Colorful and cozy. The staff were good. The food was excellent especially dal tadka and butter chicken.Price was reasonable and portions were quite large"Highly recommended
5
If you love Indian food and you're in the southeastern section of Singapore, don't miss "The Bazaar." They have a very wide selection of delicious Indian dishes at very reasonable prices. Portions are generous and service is fast and friendly. Also, it has a very Indian ambience. I enjoyed my meal there very much.
5
A variety of items on the menu, very tasty food, good ambience and good service. I and my family had a wonderful dinner here 
5
Excellent value and very tasty food, I had bhindi do pyaza ( okra) and steamed rice, massive portions, couldn't finish it. I was served popadom and dip gratis starter all for $17.40. Staff couldn't be more attentive. Very lucky find. A bit of music wouldn't have gone amiss
5
Great North Indian food tucked away in Katong...unassuming from the outside but what a pleasant surprise...attentive staff, timely service and very tasty food lacking in dollops of oil, ghee and spices which characterise the Indian fare in Little India and elsewhere...the prices would shame the high end establishments...meal for 4 including beers and a delicious paan kulfi at the end for under 125 Sing $$ !!! Highly recommended and hope they do not compromise on quality...tandoori potatoes, chicken tikka, lamb rogan josh and paan kulfi are particularly good...the latter making up for a real paan at the end of nice north indian grub
5
I was in singapore for a few days and after a few crappy meals was recommended Bazaar by some colleagues. Wish I had known about this place sooner. I loved the food and the service. It's a nice cosy place. Not too ostentatious. But the food is amazing. I highly recommend the tandoori aloo, paneer tikka, dal makhani, chilli flakes laccha. Reminded me of some of delhi's finest restaurants and on speaking with the manager, realized their head chef is from delhi. Not too expensive. Good buzz. Only gripe, they weren't playing indian music. It's a must visit place for authentic North Indian food connoisseurs

We went for lunch yesterday. For tourists, this place may be out of the main tourist areas unless you are staying at one of the east side hotels such as Grand Mecure Roxy Park. We found this a warm and cosy establishment. At lunch time they have set meals which are superb value. I had the chicken briyani set which came with a soft drink, papadam, raita, a mixed vegetable dish, dhal and a very yummy deep dried starter in addition to the briyani. All this at a great price. Another member of the group had the vegetable briyani set which came with similar accompaniments but had paneer butter masala instead of the mixed vegetables. We also ordered a few additional dishes which the service staff warned up front would be too much but we went ahead and she promised to pack whatever we could not finish. Yeah, loved the service. Food was scrumptious for the most part. Definitely worth going to if you are staying in the east
4
Bazaar is located in Katong and housed in a heritage building. The restaurant is spread over two floors( one ground and 1st floor). The staff is warm and friendly and will give you recommendations in case you find difficulty in deciding. Starters and main course were very flavour some and you cannot go wrong with anything here. Pricing is decent for a meal with or sans drinks.So having a good meal at a great location will not burn a hole in your pocket
5
Both the food and the service were excellent ... really liked the quiet environment ...quality and portion sizes are awesome....if anyone is travelling to east coast...must visit restauren
4
Taken from trip advisor as close to our hotel -Grand Mecure Roxy so only a short walk.Real simple cafe style set up Friendly staffSimple menu ,which was fine for us . Tandoor aloo and samosa starters very nice . Mains really quite large so don't over order. Efficient if you are in a bit of a hurry.A nice touch for me was after I ordered a large beer they told me that the small ones were on special 2 for 1,this was appreciated. Wish them luck in this their 2nd year
4
My review is mainly based on the starters we had.I must say I tasted the best North Indian starters in Singapore.Location: In front of Katong 12 mallAmbience:Nice. No outdoor sitting and not much crowded thus it feels good.Service:Service is good and the staff is courteous.Must try:Starters: Tandoori Aloo, Harabara kebab and paneer tikkaMain course: Bagara Bainga
4
We were after a quick, simple meal with good service - and this restaurant met our expectations. Our food was good, certainly not the best Indian food we have had but far from the worst we have had. Service was fast and friendly. The naan was very good.
4
In a city with a never ending choice of restaurants this one is definitely one to experience. Great dishes with a good balance on temperature and taste. The service was very attentive yet not intrusive. A combined scene which allows one to sit back and enjoy the mea

Fabulous food... from the staple samosas, paneer tikka, dal, naan etc. to the creative chilli flakes kulcha, paan kulfi etc., every dish was mouth watering and left you wanting some more (despite very generous portions!)... thanks to the kids play area which kept our 3-year old occupied, we were able to enjoy the wondeful meal which beat most we have had in restaurants in India... when are you opening in Mumbai

If you are Indian, and have good sense of pan Indian food and service, you ll agree. I have been in Singapore for 6 years. Till now the best Indian food I had. Its authentic. Visited on my wife birthday on 20th June. Be the drinks, starters, main course,desserts all perfect. (taste,quantity,price) .All of us were simply delighted. I personally recommend to try Chef Recommended dishes ( one with the hat) on the menu card. Perfectly made masala paneer tikka, Ginger Beer ( forgot that brand name). Staff excellent - humble, knowledgeable. Sheer delight. They also had flavour for desserts which I did'nt hear before or tried. "Paan Kulfi" and "GulabJamun Tiramasu". If you like kulfi's , dont miss this flavour of Paan Kulfi. Recommend to all and sundry

After focusing on a 15 minute walk radius from where we are staying we found no less than four places in the top 100 or so on tripadvisor. After checking each place out we opted for the Bazaar. We weren't disappointed.Very good food - the potato starters were an unexpected highlight, the bread basket was fantastic (and huge) and the main dishes themselves were great. Service was fantastic too. About the only negative point was that the upstairs was a bit empty and lacking a buzz HOWEVER we are pretty sure that's because we ate relatively early - as we were leaving the place was getting much busier, so I don't think this is a problem. Downstairs certainly felt more lively.In the end, we'd ordered too much and had to take some home with us! I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu over the next few months :)Really nicely done and the fact it's about 10 mins walk away is fantastic

The only Indian meal we ate whilst in Singapore , but worth crossing the road from the Katong village hotel . Enjoyed excellent north Indian food , reasonably priced and promptly served . Recommend it . Many thanks

Amidst the overwhelming choices of eateries in this section of East Coast Road, we happened to pick this one. The staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the setting was comfortably casual - neither whisper quiet nor noisy, And the food...AMAZING. Delicious flavors and spices. HIGHLY recommend this gem

We are living in Singapore and we often try new places. This one is really worth a review. It is a small indian restaurant on the east coast, close to Katong 112. The restaurant is very clean, the service is impeccable and the food is really great! The quality of the ingredients is higher than in other restaurants. The dishes are cooked to perfection and they just taste delightful. The size of the dishes is also bigger than elsewhere. We simply love the place. It is slightly more expensive than the average indian restaurant in Singapore, but it is worth every cent. Just go there and try. We go there weekly, it became one of our favourites

We visited this restaurant on the 23rd for dinner. We were staying in a nearby hotel and found this place while walking around. Great indian food! The taste and presentation were fantastic. At par with some of the best North-Indian eateries I've visited in India. Reminded us of home. Service was nice and food a bit expensive but worth it

I am also one of the lucky people who stumbled on this fantastic restaurant while wandering around I12. Small and intimate with a very nice decor, I found the food to be quite an experience. I've been visiting SIN for years now on business and have had the chance to eat in many small and large Indian restaurants. I rate The Bazaar as one of the best I've had here. While a little more expensive than your typical Little India eatery, the portions are quite sufficient for two and more than enough for a single diner like myself. And the chefs know very well how to balance fire vs. flavor - a skill that few establishments manage to pull off well, I'm afraid. I usually get there early (before 20:00) and the service is exceptional, but be forewarned: the place will fill up later in the evening with late-night diners. Since discovering The Bazaar, I make it a point to visit on every trip and sometimes twice in one week. Highly recommended if you're after quality Indian cuisine

I was in singapore for a business trip and was staying on the east coast. Googled for good Indian restaurants near my hotel and this showed up. Had dinner there and was very happy. Very good Indian food, especially the butter chicken and the dal. Staff were friendly and courteous. Price was also reasonable

Stumbled upon this place while finding a place to eat. Great food and friendly service. A little pricey though. Nice ambiance too

We saw the restaurant while walking the area. I had a British couple with me and I am an Indian. We all just loved the food there. Beer was on happy hour. Masala papad went good with beer, Chana Pindi had good spices, dal makhani was perfect not too creamy. My friends enjoyed the chicken chettinad. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking to enjoy Indian food. I wanted to go to another restaurant for indian food but glad i went here. Well Done guys.. Will try to visit again as I am in singapore for a few days only.

I popped into Bazaar today for a take away. The service and advice was as it should be and the time it took to make the food was less than they said so happy with that.On the other hand I am a bit mystified why the other comments have such rave reviews on the food, honestly it was just OK for me, nothing special or new in the butter chicken or fish dish. In fact the fish dish wasn't very good, a bit lumpy and almost felt the fish was under cooked. The butter naan was very plain too, maybe I was given plain instead! For the price about $50 for 2 main dishes, rice and a couple of naan it was too much for what it's really worth in my opinion.I won't be re-visiting

We drove a considerable distance across the island to try The Bazaar. I'm very pleased we did. One of the finest Indian Restaurants I've eaten at (and I've eaten at plenty across the United Kingdom, US and Singapore). I was particularly impressed by the variety of menu items. As well as my usual meat favorites like vindaloo and rogan josh were many exciting vegetable options. A vegetable lover could eat very well here. I loved the eggplant appetizer and will return again to try more of their creations. Finally the prices are very reasonable and this place was rightfully busy. Nice attentive staff too. We'll done everyone
