Very cool grunge bar, great live music. The graffiti on the walls adds to the atmosphere. They had out vivids for you to leave your mark.

Called here after a delicious meal by the waterfront.
Good live band - S$14 each - a bit pricey.
Worth a try.
4
A great spot for a few drinks and a bite to eat with great views of the river watching the cruises go by and people watching on the quay.
4
A nice bar in the nightlife district. Good music, but it does not start until 10 p.m. They serve the usual selection of drinks, paying is one by one, no tab.
4
A very popular location and you can just hear the music from the Riverside tables. Good although pricey cocktails but that's typical for Clark Quay.
4
Right by the river this is a great place for a drink and to enjoy the live bands, sitting outside you can still hear the bands whilst taking in the atmposhere of the quay
5
I've been coming to this place for the last 3+ years, and it never disappoints. I guess the music is right up my alley, classic rock 60s, 70s, and blues. Crazy Elephant is a must do spot for me.
3
I've never eaten here - too many other choices but I always stop here for a beer. Bit of a dive bar, in the best way possible. Good for old beers and live music. Bit of of US feel.
5
Overpriced drinks. Friendly service. Average snacks.And... live music ! Very VERY good live music. Must to visit for any fan of 1960s-1970s.Have spent two nights and have been happy.Seth Roach was fantastic. Bass of Kamal Bin was superb.Now it's number one in my agenda of all future Singapore visits
5
If you like live music, blues and drinks then this is the place for you. At 10pm the live music starts and they have a really good house band playing covers and home made music that will make your head wobble.I don't think there was a single person in the bar not living into the music.The service is impeccable and the prices aren't too bad for being in Clarke Quay.I like it and will bring friends and myself there in the future too
5
No matter how many times I come here the staff are friendly and welcoming and the music the best in Singapore.
4
Lovely liveband playing, excellent view and the waitresses are both beautiful and very friendly. Only downer is that my Stella is not really Stella... too bad for a very expensive version of my favorite home country beer...
4
Apparently a well known place for good music in Singapore. Not disappointed. Real musicians playing real music. Not a "pop" covers band like so many in the area.
Great blues, rock and roll and booze.
4
Went there after dinner on a Saturday evening for some great Blues and drinks. Sat at the bar watching the very efficient bartenders mixing cocktails, and enjoying the slightly risqu√© jokes on the screen
5
Great music, great beer and great location what else can I say. Travelled from Australia to here for a weekend to revisit here, its that good.
4
If you are a party person or a live music person this is the place for you to be at night. It is loud but you can always go outside as there really are no doors. just a big open walk way. Place is a little dated but you are paying extra for music if that is your thing. If it is happy hour beers you want, you can get better deals at the other places along the strip
3
Me and my partner came here to carry on drinking from boat quay back to our hotel in Clarke quay and thought it looked funky. Instead when you get inside it's scruffy, drinks are watered down and the music is so loud you can't have a conversation.
3
One of those places that would be better off when filled with people but is rather uninspiring when empty and quiet. Decor is rather drab and nondescript other than an attempt at making the place look divey with mock grafitti and scratchings on the wooden tables. Service no brilliant
4
I am usually not fussy when it comes to something refreshing or even just a beer along the way to the restaurant, especially if with a few friends. Great live music, kind and mannered personnel, nice view and a funky purple light rocks the amusing big umbrellas that characterise whole Clark Quay walk. Extra point for who cares: smoking are
4
Wandering around Clarke Quay and in dire need of a cleansing ale I stopped at the Crazy Elephant. Arrived right on 9pm so just missed happy hour which is a must when drinking in Singapore as alcohol is extremely expensive in this town. But the staff were kind enough to give me my two beers for the cheaper price and being on my own they also spent some time chatting to me which kept me entertained. Recommend it for the friendly service
5
If you are looking for authentic classic rock with good drumming and classic guitar riffs...this is the place to be. Have a drink, forget about your worries and enjoy the music live.
3
Great fun with live band. Crazy Elephant located just in the middle of busy Clark Key hot spot and you won't miss it. Easy to get in and just to get one or two with good music.
4
Not much more to say. This is a dive bar with good loud music and drinks with a blend of misfits and tourists for patrons. Go there for people and music watching. but its loud, so dont go there on a date !
4
CE is one of my favourite places to chill at especially when I'm game for live music. Drinks are priced at normal Clarke Quay rates and the service is good too!
4
Great rock band .rock guitarists, bass, accompanied by drums
Very fast finger work! Absolutely a wonder to look at. Located at Clarke Quay.
2
Staff seemed to be a bit cold and unwelcoming. Bottled water cost $10.20 and was not cold. Best live music - can't remember the band name but amazing bunch of artists really set the bars standard without it we would have left before eating our mea
5
Probably the best live blues venue in SE Asia......if anyone knows better, I would love to know about it.Have been going to this place for many years, and always a must do for every Singapore visit. Excellent band every night, and from memory, I think they have a jam session every Sunday night.Music usually kicks off at about 10:00 PM
4
When I am in Singapore and I do not want to go for the "standard" stuff, I'd rather spend some time at this cozy small rock bar when you can hear good rock music. Some bands are a bit rude, some others with good experience and nice sound. Good beer selection, but unfortunately no food to share, although you can order from other pub/restaurant nearby
4
I had been wondering around Clarke Quay one Sunday night hoping to find a good place to sit down and have a beer (the last couple of places were a little disappointed), and I found this place. The name bascially grabbed me so I went inside and was immediately rewarded with a lovely bartender. The inside has a really great feel about it, sort of like a dive bar, but not too dively. They also have live music, and a pool table. However it was the atmosphere that really caught my attention, as well as the outdoor area next to the river. Great place to wind down at night
4
The place has great energy, thanks to the coolest international bands performing there. When we went there for couple of beers and cocktails, there was a super witty and talented female performing. Crowd was having a lot of fun grooving to the music and laughing at her jokes. Must visit
5
Great atmosphere and super professional bands with reasonable price, keep performing every nigh with difference band, my favorite is all
5
Great bar to take a beer or more ! Service is very friendly, bill acceptable and always a good live concert with amazing bands. Highly recommended !
5
This is a must visit place. Great atmosphere. Good cold beer. Probably one of the best blues rock bands I have ever seen live in a bar. Recommended.
3
The location is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the beer is good and cold. Plenty goung on in the area with other bars, shops and boat tours
4
Interesting - and good - bands; are you older? You'll hear music from your youth. On Sunday night they have jam session. Simply amazing.The ambience is quite casual, with stools on which to sit and high, wooden tables. They don't have a kitchen, but you can order food and they bring it from a nearby establishment.A smaller room with a pool table is attached
4
The Crazy Elephant is a nice place to go for a drink. The band playing the night we were there was realy good. In the mean time you can read corny but funny jokes on a tv screen in the corner.(i don't like tv screens in bars..but this one is not taking all the attention away from things happening around you
3
If you are new to Singapore from Australia the drinks prices will always be a shock. Here S$30 will get you a stubby of beer and a mixed spirit so sip slowly and chack the prices before you order.But if you enjoy live music in it's raw sense then this will appeal. Blues/Rock genres seemed to prevail and the attractive river front appeal of Clark quay makes it an attractive after dinner option
5
If you are visiting Singapore and love good old live bands...this is the place to go. The vibe you get as you walk in is phenomenal. The bands are great and engaging. Drinks are expensive but that is Singapore for you. Even after they closed they just transferred our beer from the Tower to plastic cups and allowed us to sit in their outdoor area. Maybe they can start serving food but I suppose you can always eat before going there
4
Got a seat just a bit before the music started on a Friday night. Excellent selection of beers, chits at the table to order and you probably need to get up for a beer. Limited selection of bites to eat and that is great because it is mainly a beer and entertainment.One of the best Bands that we've heard in a while and pumping the whole evening that started at 10pm. You can also write your name on any space available in the bar, that is what pulled our eye to the Crazy Elephant
4
I always meet friends here for Beers, Happy Hour rates are good and the location by the river is amazing.Staff is helpful and I would recommend the Fried Chilli Chicken to go along with the beer.We always order the Hoegarden tower if we are 3-4 ppl, totally worth it
4
strolled around clark quay and went into Crazy Elephant as the live band playing was that good!
stayed there for couple of Gin Tonics till the band finished up.
Despite it was not too busy the service was quite slow..
5
I found Cazy Elephant due to my night walk at Clarke Quay. This place has an unique atmosphere with several artist each night playing an amazing rock/blues song... You should visit this place during your stay in Sng.
5
The bar is ok and they don't have food... But, that doesn't matter, the performances are great, go eat anywhere then arrive there 10pm when the music starts, have a drink... You will not regret it!
5
Visiting place every time in Singapore since 2009! Insanely great live music and jam sessions on Saturday nights! Can go there every day to meet people from all over the world. Bar is full, night is young!!!
Meet me there next time!
5
Better than ever live, THE place for great live music in Singapore. Always enjoy seeing John Chee and the Blue Machine, this time featuring Neal Goldberg on lead guitar and vocals.
4
Very nice bar with live music and good food and drinks.Just drop in and sit down - if you can find room - or take your drinks at the bar and enjoy the cosy and relaxed atmosphere with a mix of locals and tourists listening to the live band.

My no.3 place on Friday night July 10,2015. After get bore of second bar we decided to go this place for more drinks. The price for fingers food, beers and liquor are quite reasonable. French fries was nice and firm. It also have a few add on options. I picked added herb and parmesan Cheese which came with orange Cheese dip. It was quite nice and recommended for you to try out.

dropped in last night on the way back to hotel for a quick beer. The service lady was very rude, I asked if they had Guinness draught on tap and she said yes, so I ordered a pint, after the pint came out it had bubbles on top and it didn't look right, after I tasted it , it was very watery and asked the same waitress why it's like this and she replied it was from a can, so I asked to change the beer as she told me it was draught but the answer was no. So I asked for the bill and didn't drink the watery beer. Upon opening the bill folder they had tried to hide $10 u in between 2 receipts the rest of the change was on top of the main receipt then under that was the $10 and under that was another blank receipt, if I didn't look closely I would have been robbed , I just left very disappointed that this would happen in Singapore, stay away from this hole
5
We were walking home after a meal back to our hotel and were drawn in by the AMAZING music. The live band in there just simply rocked.John Hanson, a visiting blues musician, was playing and it was just fantastic. The vibe is awesome, the beer is good and the music is from another world. Will definitely go there again for the music
4
Clarke Quay itself is a wonderful little area filled with bars, restaurants and live entertainment at night time especially. We came here on our last night in Singapore and went to the Crazy Elephant for a Singapore Sling (world famous) cocktail. The drinks aren't cheap (a pint of beer is about $10 Singaporean and cocktails are about $16 which is the equivalent of $9.20/$15 AUD) but the place is brimming with charisma and they have live entertainment which creates a great atmosphere. We enjoyed our time here and would come again
4
Went early for happy hour for pre dinner drinks - had to look hard in the clarke key area for somewhere with a little bit of value. Crazy Elephant did the job.
4
The music here is always good & the atmosphere is great
Food is good bar type food & the drinks are expensive ( but normal pricing for Singapore)
I visit here every trip to Singapore - love the place
3
I liked this bar in Clarke Quay for their live music and outdoor seeting towards the river. Prices was reasonably.
5
This place has the best live band in Clarke Quay. Hands Down.
The in-house guitarist is amazing. Hoegarden on tap helps the experience.
4
We had a few happy hour drinks at this place early evening, sitting outside watching the bumboats go by was a nice experience, they dont have any english beers but the bottled lagers were ok and the chicken wings very nice.Drink prices were average for clarke quay
4
This place has the best live band in Singapore, the guitarist has magic in his fingers. the cover band can cover a wide spectrum of bands and is very energetic. Fresh, cold beer on tap keeps the mood going!. must visit. funny jokes and one liners on the screens are a welcome change from the usual boring stuff on the tv screens in most of the other bars
5
So if you have a good band playing Whitesnake, Doors, Rolling Stones, Who, Deep Purple, Janis Joplin etc. how bad can the bar be? Answer: It can be superb and so is Crazy Elephant! I think this is the best live music bar that I have found in Singapore. The bands are good, music selection is good, drinks are good and the snacks are good. Ok the place is in in Clarke Quay, but so what?! Go and check for yourself! Highly recommend
4
Just besides the main street where you have all the fancy bars and everyone's trying to look cool, you got this place. Laidback, great atmosphere, where you can go to enjoy a cold beer and a good rock n roll.Whenever I'm around, that's the place I'll go for.I didn't try the food there, just beers. They also had a happy hour system, where drinks are cheaper
3
The whole Clarke quay place looks really down.. the choice of restaurants / bars are so much deifferent than few years ago, i was bit disappointe in general.. there are lots of oriantal food, (Bad small shwarma places) , shisha etc...could not believe that I was in Singapore.... Crazy elephant is not an upscale place but probably one of the few locations you can go and have a drink and listen to a good house band. nothing very special but obviously shortlisted after so amny bad ones in Clarke quay..
5
Probably my fav in Singapore now, this bar is for people who like a rustic, laid back and different place as opposed to the all-the-same bars around Clarke quay. Great atmosphere, leave your mark on the walls like everyone before and have a tower of beer whilst tapping your legs listening to the fantastic blues rock band
