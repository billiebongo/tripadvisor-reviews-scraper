A busy restaurant but queuing for a table was minimal time. I chose the noodles with pork, not a lot of flavour but improved with some chilis. There are so many restaurants like this, it is difficult to differentiate.

I was so stuffed after eating here! literally everything was amazing. The chilled cucumber, the pork dumplings, the sesame buns!

This is the worst Ding Tai Fung! The staff forgot about my food order for red dates, forgot about my request for ginger slices & serve cold Xiao Long Bao. Avoid at all cost!

The interior is of ancient Chinese architectural setting. Food served was reasonable and with reasonable portion. As for pricing is also reasonable.

Din Tai Fung serves delicious food with courteous smile. One of my favorite places in Singapore. It doesn't have best of the ambience but, food and service makes it up for it. While I and my daughter love their Pork Dumplings and Son enjoys Dry Noodles, my being a Vegetarian relishes Vegetarian dumpling, fried rice and sautÃ©ed vegetables

My brother in law told us about this place so we decided to try it. Moreover, the two hours free parking on weekends, and on hour on weekdays, was a draw.We had to wait in line to get a table, but were impressed with the decor once we got in, especially with the show kitchen (you can see this from the outside too) where the staff were making xiao long bao. There was a short wait while menus were passed out, but service resumed quickly after that.We had the dan dan noodles to start and they were good - spicy and tart. We also had a variety of xiao long bao and these were freshly made and tasted good too. The skin was soft and the meat broth within was well balanced. We were a little surprised that they did not provide sliced ginger as a matter of course

This is a relatively new outlet and the draw is the two hours free parking on weekends and the one hour free parking on weekdays.Service was attentive once you got inside the restaurant, though that did take a while as there was only one manager at the door to bring customers to their tables on the evening we were there.We had e pork xiao long bao, which was freshly made and there were 10 piecesin the basket. There was no sliced ginger with it, as you might find in Shanghai, but it was still pretty good.We also had the dan dan mian, noodles in peanut sauce and with sliced spring onions, wonton in chilli, sweet and sour soup ( spicy!), and fried wontons. Most of the dishes were ok, though the fried wontons needed some seasoning.Drinks like coke or tea start from $4, though you can get water for 30 cents, and which they top up
