Chic, hipster feel, decent food actually. had laksa pasta and its good along with spring chicken mains that's juicy benefit the fried skin. a deliciously varied menu, had me salivating as i decided on my dinner. friendly service crew

Food was acceptable. While it wasn't anything to shout about, it wasn't bad either. Most things were self-serve. Order at the cashier, pick up your own water and sauces. Easy to get a table on a weeknight and the Entertainer app certainly made it worthwhile.

Just came back from dinner at The Assembly Ground with a group of friends. The service is excellent for a cafe as they are very helpful with our various requests. The food is good but nothing extraordinary.

Had meeting with some very old friends of mine, one of their children recommended this place for lunch and catching up. We ordered the following dishes to shareSoup of Day - Pea SoupVeg nachos as they don’t serve chilli beef anymoreTruffle & egg pizzaSalmon Cesar salad but serve mesclun instead of romaineLaksa PastaVerdictThe soup, pizza and pasta are decent but lack complexityNacho and salad is a disappointment, don’t order thatOverall I rate it as an average experience, could have more improvement in their dishes. Server wasn’t quite keen to provide some table service. From second we called for service, the server showed unwillingness to serve. Beverages are ok. Ideal place to meetup with friend

It is not easy to find a good cafe open for business before 10:30am in Singapore. This one starts at 10am on Sat & Sunday. They served good rosti with egg benedict. If you like you can start your day with a craft beer as well. Also you can catch a movie in the same building

Came here for a burger for lunch recently. Quite a popular place and fairly noisy inside as a result. The menu wasn't really that unique consisting mainly of burgers, pasta and pizza. I opted for the cheese burger which was tasty enough but the beef patty was a little dry for my liking
2
Came for a light snack as place looked cosy enough but regrettably the management had rented out a corner of their space for a "workshop" making goods out of leather so quite a lot of disturbing hammering sounds. Manager (nice guy) apologised for the inconvenience and confessed that he'd thought the "workshop" involved stitching leather pieces together, a much quieter activity. Perhaps, this cafe/restaurant should simply keep to its original function and purpose
3
Drinks were good, but no wine options. Atmosphere and the staff attention were both wonderful. Everything on the menu is laced with garlic which is a sign of a chef that doesn't know how to create flavour any other way. The carbonara pasta sauce looked like it came from a packet and was a bit average. Pizza seemed pretty good.
5
This is a very nice cafe, Staff were friendly and helpful and took orders at the table. Ordered the recommended umami pasta and surf and turf burger and I would say the food portions were generous and the taste was pretty good. We enjoyed having our dinner in this unpretentious and not so crowded cafe. Food was reasonably priced. Everyone seemed so relaxed and that's what cafe should be. I would definitely be back
3
I like their roast beef sandwich but this is way too expensive for just toasted pre-made sandwiches. Plus, you have to order and pay by the counter. There are better place for eating but it's good if you plan to order a coffee and work there
4
Food and drinks were alright. But the service and atmosphere was great for a relaxing afternoon! Will go back again.
5
Lovely decorations! Friendly staff! Food was fantastic! Nothing to complain about. My family had a great time!
4
Love the ambience in this cafe! Food was served pretty fast too. Enjoyed the truffle pasta and all day brunch, will be back again next time!
4
Located at the first floor of cathay, its a hippy and cool place to hang out for a cuppa of coffee and read your magazine. Food is hearty and nice and the price is reasonable.
1
Had the smoked duck pasta which tasted as bad as it looked. Bland and tasteless, one of the worst pasta I had. Won't revisit.
4
Food is nice, ambience is good but could have more comfy chairs, so that we can sit longer in the cafe. The menu has no pictures and font size are not friendly to the aging population. Location is also very convenient!
4
run of the mill food stuff like French fries and chicken wings. For mains pasta and steak. A couple of ciders and smoothies. They have a place for live music but not on the Saturday night we were there. Truffle fries was the highlight of the meal.
1
Just ate here and it was terrible. Asked for a medium steak and it came well done but 50% was fat and gristle. Returned it only for them to serve it cooked exactly the same with the same amount of fat and gristle. Other dish was no better and the beef patty was raw. We told the waitress this feedback and she said she told the chef and that was that.
4
Recommended cafe on level one of the Cathay for its decent coffee and food. Beef ragout and Rosti and the assembly burger definitely are worth trying. We love the green tea matcha latte as well. Usually there is a queue on weekends but weekdays seating isn't a big issue. They are on the entertainer app so do remember to use it if you have it.

Had my birthday dinner with my bunch of friends last weekend. This is not our first time there and we liked the food and atmosphere. We had a seating area and the spotlights were quite glaring, to which the staff kindly adjusted the angle to make our stay more comfortable :
4
Order mains and no coffee. Dined in with group of friends. Good value if you are on entertainer. If not, its average.
4
Slow cooked beef rossi was nice except for the tough bread that came along. Beef and chicken burgers are fantastic. Yummy spiced and crispy fries.
4
A cafe with good ambience with bicycles on the wall. The food tastes alright but some dishes might be overpriced. Nice place to relax and chit chat with friends.
3
A little overpriced for what it is even though the atmosphere is good. The sausage was really disappointing, and the bread was cold.
5
Was searching for a brunch location that opens early and located within a shopping mall and fortunately we found this place within The Cathay. Went with wife and my little prince. Think we were the first customers. Ordered a beef burger set for myself and a latte. Beef burger was alright, but the spiced fries that came with it was tasty. Yummy!!!!! Even my 1 year old prince loved them. And had at least 10 fries!!!! Wife had Egg Zoey which she mentioned was quite good as well!!! The latte was ok, but I was appreciative of the good service we had there. Friendly greetings. The boss even helped to sterilized my boy's pacifier with hot water at his request. Impressive!!! Where can you find such good service initiated by the restaurant. Will definitely head back for a return visit.

I tried the brunch in the morning. The portion is small for $20. We had to order from counter, though they have staff nearby. Water and cups can be taken from the side counter. Not much of a service or food valueCoffee - is acceptable. Wont be coming bac

4th Time here and the food's still as good!Such a pity the "popcorn chicken" was taken out of the menu permanently. The manager recommended Nachos in place, and when it arrived we were shocked that it was slathered in minced beef. Upon request to change the order, the management did it without fuss to truffle fries; that's great customer service for you.Tried something new; the Ham, cheese mushroom pizza which turned out to be surprisingly delightful. Will be back again
3
Food is good, coffee really tasty but 51 dollars for breakfast for two people is madness! I thought London was expensive but this place is unfortunately a winner! I would like to come more often but with those prices I'm gonna stick to the coffee only.
4
We went to this place after lunch yesterday. We ordered - Flat White which was good but little too milky for his liking. The aroma, acidity, body, flavor and aftertaste were all little too weak. - Matcha Latte was very good. It had strong green tea aroma, good body, nice flavor and aftertaste. The service was not so attractive. The way they talk to the customers were weird. The ambiance and decorations were chic.. Like it! Likely will not come back for Coffee but only for Green Tea Latte.
3
Nice cafe, friendly staff that tell me a bit more about the dishes when I ordered. Wanted to get a soup but ordered something else that wasn't, so the guy at the cashier helped to clarify it for me. Would be nice to have some form of cushion on the metal seats.Felt that the order-and-pay-at-counter before being served your meal was a bit different from normal, but otherwise ok. There's free water that you can help yourself to as well. :
3
Convenient location next to the cinema but both the food and the service are below average and very expensive. The portions are a bit small and the ambiance is nothing special
4
Nice ambiance where it is suitable for gathering with friends and family. They provides great customer service and served yummy foods !
5
Good mix of self-service with staff assistance. In Singapore, this needs to happen to keep staff numbers efficient. The restaurant gets busy, but the team manages to deliver good food and service.
4
Yummy food, friendly staffs and nice ambience :) great experience with my friends and we will definitely be back again.
1
I ordered a top up of egg and smoked salmon.. Total charged of $7 with I see nth on my platter!! When I seek for the assistance advise.. She mention the top-up items was actually into my platter -.-" Also.. Tho they are not charging any service charge (which I shoudnt expect much on their service) but their attitude was really rude. eg: mocking at customer Infront of other customer....
4
Ordered the smoked duck pizza and crabcake benedict. With the 1-for-1 deal at entertainer app, I am glad I got to enjoy the meal at ~50% off! The price was rather steep without the deal but the standard and quality of food is certainly worth a try! A pretty much cosy ambience that's great for chilling over a cuppa or having some me-time.
4
Their angus beef stew with rosti is very very good. The smoked duck pizza is good too. Do give their mac and cheese a miss as it's not very worth its price. Fish and chips are good too, fish is fresh and nicely deep fried. Portions are good for their price.Price is still on the steep side but considering the food quality, this is somewhere I would visit again. Staff are all rather unfriendly and cold and look like they hate the place
4
Food is great with a nice ambience. One of the better cafes in the vicinity and not overly packed. Coffee is delicious and there is a 1 for 1 main course if you use the entertainer app. We miss out on the 1 for 1 due to the festive season which is not applicable but will be back again to utilise our dea

Was my 4th time at Assembly ground, and there isn't much deviation for the 4th visit from the first 3. Besides the fact that there is alot of self-service expected, staff were rather friendly. On the main point (which is brunch), was the first time I tried the green tea latte and it was... pretty pleasant! The Assembly Brunch meal was alright as usual. I would really recommend the popcorn chicken though! Eat it while it's hot, and dip them into lots of sauce! Summarily, the prices were reasonable for a brunch affair.Pertaining to the atmosphere, (personally) the ideal atmosphere would be a relaxed, outdoorsy place with a scenic views but not for assembly ground as it is located within an urban mall. On the other hand, there is an "Assembly Store" located right beside the cafe for brunchers to do a lil shopping. Would be great if the two areas were integrated together though.For the IGers, there isn't good lighting to take nice pictures of the food and of your partner/ friends, but that's not the main point for brunch.Assembly Ground has delivered up to expectations, on the overall

Went to the assembly ground on the sunday evening for dinner. The crowd was still good. For food, we ordered popcorn chicken,smoked salmon spaghetti & spicy sausage and bacon. While drinks, we ordered ice honey cabana & root beer float. Waiting time for our food was about 5-7mins which i think it's rather fast. Portion of the food was enough for me. Food tasted good though I think the smoked salmon was a little too salty. Price of our orders was a little higher but still quite worth it. Will go back there again (
4
Food wasn't fantastic but the ambience made up for it. Price was relatively cheap compared to cafes in the town areas
3
Food's overpriced and not filling
Was not expecting to pay so much for such little food provided. Too overpriced
4
Ordered the Assembly Brunch and truffle fries. Wonderful. Will return. Nice place to relax on the weekend.
5
Food was good and nice ambience. Will definitely recommend to all my friends and will be back soon. Great place!
5
Great ambience, service and no service charge. No service charge as you need to play your order at the counter, but everything else is served, water are on a self-help counter, so are the condiments. A cheap and no frills dining place.
3
Food was delivered very fast. Mushroom and spinach salad was good. My pulled chicken sandwich was ok, not particularly memorable. I ordered a Mocha and it tasted like hot chocolate. Nice ambience but would not purposely make a trip there.
4
Great place to catch up with friends over good food and drinks. The angus beef ragout was a delicious plate of tender beef cubes, mushrooms, crispy rosti, spinach, a slide of buttered sour toast, perfectly cooked soft egg and a smidgen of onion jam. Do try the iced matcha latte too which was made extra creamy and decadent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
2
Maybe its a Friday night .... was extremely noisy esp with the music. The interiors was actually quite nice. Food was realli mediocre. The truffle fries was over-rated ... can't really taste the truffle. Beef rosti ..... rosti was small than the palm size .... beef was tough ... with a piece of huge multi grain bread .... hmmm which is the star of the dish. Only the drinks were good actually. Comes with ice cream too
4
The staff was polite and assisted in helping me change my reservation at the very last minute due to an extended meeting I had on that day. The ambiance was nice for a date or a group of friends, with a nice selection of food. However, I asked for a surprise as I am celebrating a friend's birthday on that day. Despite sharing through the phone call that I want it to be a surprise with a dessert and all, they just passed me a cup of parfait with no candles nor any special birthday writing like how other restaurants can provide. Hence, it was awkward when the waitress served it to us randomly towards the end of our meal. I hope this can be improved as I'm sure a lot of people would love to have a special arrangement when celebrating occasions in the restaurant.
3
Great ambience with mediocre pasta, that's all I can conclude with this restaurant. For 18 dollar pasta, I was expecting pretty decent pasta with rich flavour. Instead I was getting noodle with heavy tomato flavour. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not rich my expectation.
