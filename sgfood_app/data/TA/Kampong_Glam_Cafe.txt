Kampung Glam Cafe is packed every morning, afternoon and night. Great place for good food and good price in Bugis Area in Singapore Near from Masjid Sultan.

This place is packed every morning, afternoon and night. Great place for good food and good price in Bugis Area in Singapore. A must is the Teh Tarik!
4
I always visit this place whenever I’m in town. Serves a range of good food and great service as well.
4
The food was nice. Except morning they served heavy breakfast type - lontong (possibly its common for locals). Ala carte only available after 4pm.
4
I always come here for my lunch break, and for meat/fish with 2 vegetables with rice at around S$6.00
5
This restaurant also well known and a must to visit if you come to Kampong Glam area. there have lot of choices for food and I like their Ice lemon tea!
3
Delicious food, recommended local spot but you can't stay here for long time with family (toddler and babies) because it is open air restaurant
4
We had skewers, beef fried rice and braided salmon fry. Fried rice was a bit salty for my father's liking but overall it was very good. I would like to visit again.
3
It's a cheap dining with chinese/malay/peranakan cuisine.Me and my partner tried the nasi goreng daging, and hongkong mie.Both were okay, service was fast. The lechy ice drink was really refreshing.They had lots of traditional cakes and sweets, but most are gone by dinner time. It's a place to go if you need Halal, no fuss meals. The place is always packed. Really good if you just need simple meals.The location is very good. Just near the Masjid Sultan
3
This cafe is easy to find and always packed with many tourist. I tried their mee rebus which is too sweet for me..but after I add more lime and chili it's quite delicious. They serve a lots of Malay Cuisine as well..Worth to try while you're in Kampong Gla
4
I always try to come to this cafe when I get back to Singapore. They have many delicious dishes with low prices.
5
The perfect place to eat a lot of great food for an unbeatable price. If you want to try the Singaporean cuisine this place is a must.
4
Relaxed local spot for hangouts, simply setting, simple menu. Be warned vegans, there's hardly anything you can eat or drink here, but maybe you can try customizing a dish.
5
nice location high quality food low price and u can find all local food in there ,,i think best restaurant in arabstreet great taste exactly u must try roti John tost nasi birhiyani nasi goteng and tea tarik
4
This cafe serves reasonable priced local food even though it is located in the tourist area. But it is not air conditioned so better to visit in the evening. Rather crowded but good place to soak up the local atmosphere.
5
Very busy restaurant full of locals. What I liked is friendly approach and help about choosing meals. Don't expect the glamorous sitting as they have plastic ones. But you will have beautiful view and mosque behind or in front of you, depends where you will be sitting. I loved chicken curry with local soft bread and fried noodles have been very nice. Five stars goes to service and friendly member of staff who was excellent. We shall definitely go back
4
With so many eateries all around, I like to see the places that are full of locals rather than full of tourists. This place is constantly full of locals. I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but the woman behind the counter was lovely and told me what everything was. I tried several small items and just wish I had found it before my second last day. Don't be put off by the range of foods: just ask for help and they will give it. My food and my teh tarik were both delicious and the price was ridiculously cheap. I will be back next time I'm in Singapore
5
A wonderful way to enjoy local food; experience it the way the locals do...by dining at communal tables on the canopied covered sidewalk! A great variety of local food is available in the glass covered cases, and photos of local favorites are provided as well. Locals seem to enjoy the food as it's always crowded. Well worth the effort to find it and enjoy the experience
4
At any time of the day, this popular corner cafe is busy with local trade. In the evenings, it can be hard to get a table, such is the demand, and the locals tend to linger and chat over their drinks (non-alcoholic). The menu is long and the prices are low. Go where the locals go
3
Menu with variety of local malay favourites. Tried the nasi lemak, nasi goreng kampong, soto ayam, roti kirai. All taste yummy! Good and prompt service!! Price is very reasonable in this "tourist" location. Very pleased with my visit except that food served were not hot enough, just a bit warm. Hope they can improve on this & i'll surely be back again! :
5
ordered mee siam and seafood kwee tiauw, teh limau and hot milo for the drink... only spend SGD10. Environment is very cozy and the food is recommended
4
i really like this cafe because halal, cheap, and have a good taste. mee goerong taste like mie aceh in indonesia, so i feel like in Indonesia.
5
Nice authentic food and reaally cheap. Found this gem because it was the fullest restaurant near our hostel.
5
Many times visit here and never get bored. Unfortunately, it doesn't have Nasi Briyani anymore. So, I try Rice noodles, it taste unique, sweet and sour.
5
Delicious food at some of the best prices around!!! They do not skimp on the portions either. Open late which is great for travelers who are just arriving or are adjusting to the time difference. Really friendly staff which is a bonus. We ate here 3 times in our three day stay. I loved being able to eat outside and enjoy the night air
4
We went here for late dinner since we arrived at 10 pm at our hotel @ the Pod. There were many people - outdoor cafeteria but with street style ambience. I thought it would be hard to get service. I was totally wrong. We arrived and soon one of the waiters offered us a table for too. We didn't have to wait long to order, get drink, food, and our bill. Yes, our bill was printed out nicely and without us going to the register. The food was good. I tried mee siam, pattaya fried rice, iced Teh Tarik, and Milo Dino. I would say it is good value for cheap price with service
5
I come here a lot whenever I'm in Singapore as it is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel I stay in. The breakfast is much better and about 25% of the price of a standard hotel "western" buffet and lunch is even better. It can get a bit crowded but is well worth the effort
3
Decided to eat here when we were in the area. Tried the lontong with curry. Taste is original just like the local in my home town. The teh tarik also good. Price is reasonable. As we eat for lunch it is very hot so we didnt actually enjoy the whole dining experience. Perhaps it is better visit this cafe for late lunch in the afternoon or dinner
4
We needed a quick pit stop and stumbled across Kampong Glam Cafe which is surrounded by restaurants that are far more expensive. We were absolutely thrilled with our meal, great selection of options and really affordable. Highly recommended, and will seek out again next time we're in Singapore
5
It is 1am and I am chowing down on the most delicious plate of Mee Goering for only 4$. The place is almost full, so the atmosphere is alive. Across the road a guy is playing music with adds to the atmosphere. Free wifi to boot. Delicious, cheap, atmospheric
4
This place is always busy which is a good sign. The food is so cheap but very tasty. I would definitely recommend this place if you want authentic, traditional local food
4
super cheap with tasty food. so many choices for food, but the nasi goreng or mee goreng only can be ordered after 4pm.
4
Super cheap, authentic Singapore/Malaysian food. Worth visiting if you're in the area but toilets are vile so prepare yourself
5
The taste is good! just 5$ for nasi lemak + te tarik. Open in the morning till evening. There are snack too
5
I was informed of this cafe by a friend of mine who has been here several times and sing praises of it.The set-up is simple.You join the queue [usually long unless you go there very early in the morning but it moves swiftly], tell the person behind the counter what you want by pointing the vast array of food right in front of you, order drinks, pick a few kuehs [tradional sweet or savoury cakes] by the cashier, pay for it, take your food and sit down. I personally like the lontong [rice cakes with yellow vegetable coconut curry] with a few add-ons and sardine puffs. The food is tasty, delicious and most on offers are traditional Malay -Singaporean fare. Sadly on the last morning I was in Singapore the cafe was closed.I can't wait to go there again.
4
Both my son and I often crave for teh tarik and kueh kuehs(Malay pastries). Here there's a wide variety in the fridge. The tek tarik is good and well balanced. Some places taste too milky but no tea while others just watery. Curry puffs are always crispy and though I never liked the sardine variety this is one place I would eat as it does not taste fishy. Nasi Lemak, Lontong and choice of dishes for its Nasi Padang is wide and very tasty. Must admit nowadays its hard to find really runny fried eggs to go with rice. No lack of tables and always crowded with locals and tourists alike. I'll keep coming back so long as they are here as many other similar cafes have disappeared and converted to modern drinking places and losing the charm of the old world that was Kg Glam. Lastly it's still value for money for the simple satisfying food
4
The nasi pataya seafood is our favourite. You can order non spicy, but the spicy one is better. Don't expect great service. It's all basic but cheerful here. And prices are amazing! If you can get a table at the Busorah Street side, you have a fantastic view of the mosque.
5
Since we traveled all day long till drop playing in USS and watching Wings of Time, all the menu in Kampong Glam Cafe were just delicious. I tasted three menus just like Mee Goreng, Seafood Kweteeauw Goreng, and Mee Hoon Soto, all way lingered in my tongue. Not just because we(10 of us) were starving, but my friends also said that all meals here are best of 2-day cheap-budget culinary experience. Meals are halal and cheap, about $3.5-5.5 per meal, drinks just about $1.5-3. Around you'll find souvenir shops, hostel, and Masjid Sultan. You can't miss this area in your Singapore visit to experience sholah in masjid, shopping, and culinary
5
Spent $6 on a bowl and shared. Was delicious, no idea what the the dish is called so include a picture.Be aware it is budget in all the best ways. Zen out on those plastic chairs and bring your own napkins or pay a nominal fee
4
I highly recommend this joint if you are on a budget, the majority of restaurants on Arab street charge $20 for a main which means a lunch date can be very expensive. We went to this cafe because it was busy and full of locals. There were no listed prices and it was somewhat difficult to establish which item was what! Nevertheless we made some solid guesses and had a hearty lunch. The beef curry was to die for and melted in the mouth, the chicken curry was flavoursome and the sides were tasty. $12 for two people including a can of coke
5
Stopped by as need a quick lunch. Great food, low cost, efficient service, lime water was really excellent.
5
Fast, cheap and tasty food at this restaurant. The waiter is funny and provided swift service. Food was good and is very affordable. We had two main dishes, 3 drinks and paid less then 20 S$.
4
A popular food space at Baghdad St, sells typically Malay rice and noodle dishes, e.g. nasi lemak. Good place for a cheap, wholesome meal in the Arab Street area.
5
The best food in Singapore! ! !
Best prince for the best taste :)
Good service, good location. A lot of people.
4
Great and affordable place to have a cup of coffee, lime juice or other drink. Didn't try the food. Many other places in the area have unfortuantely "greeters" to drag people into their place, but Kampong Glam does not fortunately. That's also why we ended up there in the first place. Not so many tourists, mainly frequented by locals. Enjoyable
5
The best alternative to eat halal food around bugis street. The menus are variable from western to asian. The price also effortable, around $1-$20 SGD. Only open at night, right after maghrib. I tried seafood fried rice, tom yam fried rice, hongkong fried rice, roti john with cheese, lychee tea, iced tea, and teh tarik. All of them are crazily delicious so that you must try when you get to Singapore :
3
I recently visited Singapore and toured my relatives who are first timers in SG. I was eager to have them try local food and the first restaurant (local cafe) I had in mind was this since we just went to the Bussorah Street Mall. I must say the food was a little overrated and I heard my relatives say the food was tasteless. Nevertheless, the experience is good, trying what the locals eat. probably not a preferred spot but worth a try. Oh also, the staff weren't friendly (in my opinion)
1
Ordered chicken & beef dishes with rice and they tasted horrible. Had to leave most of it. The lime blue cola is some weird blue drink that's got nothing to do with cola. Teh tarik was ok, nothing to write home about. Place seems popular with locals but I think that's probably because it's cheap and open till late. Wouldn't go here again
4
Everything was so cheap! We had Nasi Lemak,Beef rendang, 1 pc of chicken with rice for my daughter, vegetable soup, iced tea, calamansi honey drink for just $15. I loved the food and experience of eating there but sadly for my husband who had the beef rendang, he found the coconut taste too overwhelming. I wanted to go back and taste the rest of the dishes but we only had 5 days and too many places on our list to check out so I will surely go back on our next SG trip.
5
We ate here once and got takeout another time. For clarity, our "excellent" rating is because this place is great at what it does, not because it deserves a Michelin star. We are food tourists, and this is our kind of place. Both times we were served by the same lovely guy - your mileage may vary, but our experience was great both times. Great way to sample Malay food, definitely at a table out on the sidewalk with a view of the mosque. Fantastic people watching all around. If you're not sure what to order, you might try the roti kirai, definitely the mee goreng, perhaps a kuay tiao and a gado gado. Definitely get their teh tarik - can have it hot or cold. This place has earned a spot in our regular Singapore roster.
4
Local food galore. The taste of Singapore in a plate. Must try when you are in the area. You have "breakfast all day" meal to some exotic dishes!! I must say the food here is rather cheap!
5
Close to my hotel, but this place offered great value food. Shame no beer, but I guess you can't have everything !!
5
Typical Malay courtesy great food at very reasonable prices, a must see just off the Beach Road at local prices. Then head to Haji lane or Arab Street
5
Food is cheap and delicious. I think it is the most affordable place to eat around that area as the place is flooded with cafes which is quite expensive. We can have a affordable decent meal here,
1
If you stay or came to Bugis Street and you miss indonesian or melayu food, you should came here. This cafe were served melayu food and many indonesian and asian too. This cafe also very cheap. Recommended.
4
The place is not nice at all but it was full of locals and tourists eating so I seated there to check it out. It is cheap and the food is really good. The waiter was very helpful explaining me each dish. I had the Kway Teow Goreng with beef, it was great. They were very thin noodles with vegetables and beef and a bit spicy. I had a big lemonade but it tasted different to regular lemonades and it was very good too. I also had some typical dessert, that one I didnt like it so much. For all that I only payed 5 dollars!!
4
This is our favorite food joint during our 3 days stay. The front office manager of our hotel recommended and said the Nasi Goreng Pattaya is superb. Have to agree with him. They have good range of Malay dishes for breakfast, lunch & dinner. But just to alert that hot dishes the like of fired rice & noodles are only available after 4pm daily. This cafe is also popular amongst the local office workers so its best to go early to avoid the lunch crowd
5
Loved this join! The service crew are friendly and a chatty bunch! Lunch selection are the cheapest on Arab St. with great home cooked selection. The atmosphere is bustling during lunch so be sure to bring along a packet of tissue or a brolly to place on the table while you queue for your meal or else you won't get a seat. Breakfast selection, Mee Rebus or Nasi Lemak and I love coming down on Sundays while I'm still in SG with my Wife. Less people and more time to chat. I love this place as it is affordable, good and smack at the center of Arab St, a good vantage point to capture pictures of the minaret of Sultan Mosque. Do watch for traffic! I'd come back anytime for sure!
5
Excellent local food favorites! Great ambience around the Arab street old shop houses and mosque nearby with their casual servers. Try the famous favorites of local dishes such as Mee rebus, Mee Siam, laksa, Nasi Rawon and many more coupled with the very good Teh Tarik! An improvement that can be made for this cafe of about 100 seatings capacity is to upgrade their toilets! This cafe has operated for many years and they can do justice to the cafe by upgrading the cafe restrooms which is appalling! I'm sure the cafe owners can afford to improve this facility with packed cafe with diners during most meal times. I would still give them a 5 star rating as I enjoy visiting the cafe monthly sometimes fortnightly.
5
Its cheap, quick and easy.Saved us a lot of money in SG, the iced coffees are delicious.We ended up eating here most days, and the staff start remembering you!Its not silver service but the restaurant is always full and its a fun dining experience.If you're a Vego I recommend the Mee Hoon Goerng Vegetarian.BEWARE - If you ask for it extra spicy it comes out extra spicy .
5
They serve one of the best Mee Hoon Soto I have ever eaten in my life. The soup is so tasty that I can wipe it clean with my tongue. Delicious!!
3
Crowded with workers while lunch time
Normal Malay food with normal price
It's good for daily use
4
The food is nice..which it suit the malay taste bud.. but unfortunately the space is so limited..the list of menu offers..are awesome..:)
4
This is the kind of place you could eat at every day at any time. It's not the finest food you can buy, but there's plenty of choice, it tastes great and is very cheap, especially for Singapore. Ate here several times as it was a 2 minute walk from where I was staying, and would no doubt eat here again if given the chance
4
Located at the corner of Arab Street. Non aircon cafÃ©. Malay food choices are displayed. We chose a meal set with 2 viand and rice. Curry chicken, vegetables and rice and Fried Chicken Tofu and rice were tasty. Iced Tea with lime is only SGD 1
5
While holidaying in Singapore, our family enjoyed delicious dishes at the Kampong Glam Cafe! The Mee Rebus (yellow noodles and the gravy looks) is excellent. And the favourite NASI LEMAK, wow! Tend to be very crowded during breakfast times. But worth the visit to this CAFE
5
Came across this bistro by accident. Their menu, except for the western food and the drink sections, is pretty much written in malay and indonesian. So, if you are the kind of person who needs to know exactly what you are ordering, I'd recommend studying the menu on their website a bit before going there. Ordered Soto Ayam ( soto means soup noodles, i guess and ayam means chicken, spicy optional), Lontong (rice cakes dipped in coconut curry sauce and a little bit of chili-fishy stuff on the side), calamari rings and lychee drink with real fruit inside.Except for the calamari rings, we liked the food very much. The lychee drink was a bit too sweet. I think their calamari rings are only a mixture of calamari and other fish meat, unlike the usual calamari rings you would get in a western restaurant. The amount was quite sufficient for two girls with normal appetite
2
Went there for dinner, ordered tauhu goreng it was hard, they did not fried on the spot when I order, they just poured peanut sauce on cold fried tauhu and serve. The gado gado was alright with some veggies, that was the best among the dishes we ordered. The mee rubus looks alright but taste wise would be below average. Normally I don't waste food and would try to almost finish my orders, but this is quite bad and the mee rubus, tauhu goreng have more than 1/2 remaining. Good to go just for drink
3
It's one of the restaurant that open at morning. You may choose many variant of ala carte menu such as Lontong, mee siram. I prefer choose Lontong siram and that menu came with a lot so if you the type of not eating much you could share this menu for two
1
The place was crowded with locals so I assumed it was cheap and good. Well, it was cheap. $4 for food and $2 for coffee is cheap in singapore. But the picture showed a rice dish with 2 sides. The actual food they brought was just one item: a pile of rice with a little red sauce which tasted like diluted campbell's tomato soup, and not even very warm,and a few tasteless pieces of chicken thrown in, some of which were just big chunks of gristle. I would say that dish was overpriced by a factor of four. Then when it was time to pay all the staff looked at each other-- then they asked me what I had. I said "I don't know, it's in Chinese, I just pointed at the picture". Finally they figured out I owed $6. The guy who took the money wanted $6.50. So I said "That guy said $6." When he pressed I said "It was terrible. I'm going to give you a bad review". And they finally let me walk away. I honestly don't know what all the people were there for. I guess they would dog food as long as it was cheap
5
I came here many years ago and made sure I found this place again. Delicious authentic and amazingly well priced. Mostly frequented by locals. Love it
4
I love the lontong ! The taste is superb!
Price is reasonable.
Wide selection of food.
Ambience is fantastic. Good place to hangout.
Parking is available around this area.
5
must try for breakfast. always packed with a lot of people. tried kacang pool, mee goreng seafood, soto. all taste great!
5
We followed our own advice and came to the place where there was a long queue of locals. So it must be good. The food was all displayed, so it was easy to point to what you wanted. There were various meat, chicken, fish and vegetable dishes, rice and noodles as well as sweet things. Sodas or juices to drink - the fresh lime juice was delicious.We shared a beef rendang and a fish curry and noodles. Then we went up for some chicken and rice. Then we went back for a coconut cake dripping in honey. We could have worked our way through the whole menu, but we didn't have time. It was amazing quality food at an incredible price. Simple and clean, with friendly staff.Near to Arab Street and the Malaysian Cultural Centre, a big golden domed mosque and good shops for fabric and pashminas, so you can buy one of those first, wear it to lunch and be glam at the Glam Cafe
4
Very good cost benefit. I usually spend $4 to $6 dólares in a full plate. You choose rice and than eu pick whatever you want. Try eggs with soy sauce and green peper. But the place is very simple and you have to bring your own napkin.
4
Traditional Singaporean food / Thai/ western dishes at very affordable prices. Most meals are roughly $4 - $6 Singapore dollars and drinks are around 1.50$. The best part is that it's located on the corner of a bustling street so great for people watching and enjoying the sights. The food is really good too. Not 5 star meals in terms of presentation but they taste damn good
4
Went there during lunch,The place was packed with people, locals, businessman, a few tourists.All this gave a great atmopshere.Food was very fresh and tasty.They serve you rice and then you can just choose between 15 dishes to add with your rice.The price is very reasonable.Would definitely go back if i am in the area
2
My wife and I had lunch there on January 3, 2015 after a little shopping at Arab Street area. Best of all, the resto offers halal foods. Unfortunately, the foods are tasteless and the ambiance is dirty. What annoyed us was bees flying around. This resto cannot sell halal foods but ignore everything else. Truly not recommend for a visit
1
Ordered a Local dish named Nasi Goreng and it had a terrible smell. When I asked the waiters why, he said this is the way its cooked. Couldn't continue eating. Left immediately after paying. There were rats running around towards the last few tables where I was sitting. Never ever come here.
4
One of our Singapore friends took us to this open air semi-covered popular café which seems to be almost always full. The Asian food with a Malay bias proved to be very tasty and very reasonably priced. The waiters were very responsive to adjusting how 'hot' the sauces will be, ensuring happy dining for all our party. Recommended for tourists wishing to try good local food, but be prepared for many locals also vying for a table
4
the food is great for my taste, the price will not dry out your pocket, this place is highly recommended
3
Go fo their main dishes. Fried kway teow, Pattaya rice, fried mee seafood. Awesome stuff. Other than that, can't recommend much. A good place to people-watch though.
Reasonably priced. Always crowded at night.
5
The food selection was wonderful. If you're Asian and have to have rice as your staple diet, this is the place to go.
we went there twice due to the wonderful food! =)
4
It's a budget cafe. Can be a plus or minus, since the place is usually crowded. But still, your order is served under 10 mins.
4
Sit on the street in the Arab quarter and listen to the imam call the faithful to prayer at Sultan Mosque while eating the local special: nasi lemak accompanied by a tall glass of icy fresh lime juice for two, and get change from $9!
4
The Cafe is a buffet-style eatery with open air dining. The line can get really long at times, which is a good indication of its popularity. My new friends who took me here told me it offers traditional Malay food. If you're looking for a locally-authentic food experience, stop here
4
As we were in the area, we were deciding where to eat, and the Kampong Glam Cafe was full, and hence we went there. The food, was delicious and reasonably priced. I would recommend any noodles, and the nasi goreng pattaya, which was egg fried rice in an omelette with some really nice sauce. This probably isn't the place for someone, who's looking for fine dining, but if you want a taste of authentic local food, this is the place to go
1
I don't give bad reviews on food but this is my first one.I used to patronize them every few weeks as I like their fried chicken a lot.Had lunch with a friend yesterday and horrified to see a black string from the mop in my veggie. (black color, so you can imagine how dirty is the mop !!) I regretted I didn't take a picture of it. Immediately I went over to ask the helper what's that. The 'black" faced lady saw it and used her hand to pick up the string and threw it away. No apologies at all as I waited for them to do next course of action. I should have yelled but the cashier girl picked up my signal, said sorry and asked me to choose my set again. I saw that they didn't even change the whole set of "contaminated" veggie, not sure if they do later. But it seems to me is "business as usual" after I walked off with my new set of rice with veggie.My friend and I have banned this place. Frankly, to my humble opinion, they are not cheap given that kind of standard, I am sure there are more better and "hygienic" ones around this place.Very disappointed and will not go again
1
i came here many times. the food sometimes nice and sometimes it taste of burning. and e service was excellen accept of e one maly guy. he keep on calling for customer, and when we were just about to eat he will tell ask, excuse me pls eat faster, after u ate pls leave. what kind of service is dat?
4
I first dropped by here early one morning when all other cafes were closed. A regular but very nice milky, sweet coffee that almost everyone was drinking, and a fraction of the price the 'yet to open' places were offering on their menus! Free Wifi was available, just asked for password. Late morning thro' lunchtime and afternoon this place was busy serving meals, a large queue forms at the counter but service is fast, they don't serve what is on their big menus plastered about the place (maybe thats evening?) just whats already prepared behind the big glass counter. Tasty, varied Malay food at good prices, just have an idea what you want before being served as it all gets a bit frantic! Main dish with rice and vegetables under S$8 each. Their cakes and calamansi juice are good too
