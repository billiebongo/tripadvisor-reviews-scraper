Was here on a weekday night and there were not many people. Food was delicious and service was good.

Excellent range of fresh seafood. Spoiled for choice but whatever you chose, great stuff! Service was great too. Crew aged but friendly and attentive. Weekday offers cannot be faulted.

If you want fresh and tasty seafood, this is a good place for sure at reasonable prices. However, I will avoid hosting any guests here since the place is pretty worn and will not make a good first impression.

Can't get any fresher! You pick what you want to eat at the "tanks" outside the restaurant and the chef will cook it. The razor clams steamed with garlic sauce is to die for!

Had lunch last week with family and ordered the Boston lobster cooked with bee hoon, bamboo clam with garlic, prawn, steam fish and sambal kangkong. All the dishes were great, taste just nice not too salty. With the weekday lunch offer, it's even sweeter. Will visit again for their fresh seafood

This is a good place to eat bamboo calm, lala (some sort of calm) and many other seafood like crab, fish. You choose from the varios tanks and choose how u want them cook. I have been time numerous of time. Have not disappoint me except for the few times that i have forgotten to make reservation and have to sit outdoor which i still feel warm despite the number of fans on the ceiling

Seafood can't get fresher than this! Pick your choice of seafood from the tanks outside the restaurant and let the server know what style you want them cooked in. Because we went on a Monday, there wasn't anyone else but us so we had excellent service. Highly recommended

Visited Owen seafood on a Friday evening with a group of friends. Having visited so many seafood restaurants in Singapore, this is one of resturant that provides really fresh seafood at a very reasonable price. You have to choose your choice of fish, oyster, crab etc and get to pick how you want it to be cooked. There are no additional cost in cooking (note: most places charged extra "cooking fee"). We ordered grouper fish, steamed. Chef did a good job in steaming the fish just right, complementing it with right garnishing (just like having a fish in Chinese resturant like Tung Luk/ peach garden). The fresh oysters are fresh and for 20 of them, only cost almost $50. We ordered 2 crabs, one steam and one Chili. Thumbs up. Only down side is the steam tiger prawn with garlic. The prawns are very fresh but the Chef spilt the prawns too much and it's a little salty. The service staff is great too. Constantly paying attention to our needs and changing plates & refilling our drinks. We bought several bottles of wine there and not only there are no corkage fees, the service staff proactively provide us wine glasses, ice bucket to chill wine etc. We also had a few non seafood dishes like stir fry vegetables, tofu. It's also well cook and tasty. Definitely recommend this place. It may not have a Super elegant resturant setting, however the great service staff and fresh, tasty seafood makes this place very worthy to go to! Definitely visit again! Thank you for such a great evening!

First visit to this restaurant, which is situated right next to Ah Yat. The indoor seating's ambient was horrible, dull yellow lighting, worn out chairs that looked filthy, exposed old wiring. Total turn off even before the food arrived. The food was generally decent, not impressive. Crab in butter cream sauce tasted like green curry crab... probably won't come back unless I have no choice

My Singaporean friends took me to this restaurant because I told them that I love seafood. This place was packed and we had to wait about half an hour. However, it was worthwhile. I love Chilli Crab which is the best!

Best chilly Crab my choice and prawn are fresh and many others. We were serve by a wonderful waitress Ms Xiong Di Ann, she shows attentiveness and warmth care even though she had to go round about 8 tables. We hope the restaurant managers could reward deserve and hardworking staff

Owen is located in Grandstand , formerly known as Turf City. The unit on level 3 doesn't have lift access. Located near Ah Yat, so be careful to see which entrance you are entering.There a free and plentiful parking at Grandstand. Owen as al-fresco and aircon ( a tad too cold ). You are assigned a seat, see the tanks of seafood with unit prices listed on them, choose your animal, the guy nets them for you, weighs them and gives you the price (printout) immediately. No dispute there. Then back at your seat, you tell the waitress how you want it cooked ( free service ).We sat in the aircon section, drafty and our food gets cold fast. Either that or al-fresco style with the humidity but overlooking the field. 2 mud crabs, 3 big bamboo clams, about 10 big prawns,vegetable cost us $150. Not extremely expensive by SG standards.Try cooking the crabs salted egg style and forgo about the butter style-it's watery and neither Indian or Chinese in style. Mantou is very small but tasty bites. The prawns were cooked in crunchy cereals, absolutely yummy. Food is mostly agreeable. Not wheelchair friendly if you are thinking of eating in aircon comfort.I will come if I crave mud crabs and perhaps try the Scotland brown crab too. Good for the occasional treat without blowing a hole in the pocket

This has to be the most affordable Seafood Restaurant in Singapore where mostly visited by local. The food is nice with a wide selection of fresh seafood where you choose from the aquarium. They offer indoor or outdoor seating, Family friendly and they do offer private room for private function as well. Do try this restaurant out

A bewildering selection of live seafood to choose from and equally many ways of preparation. The competent wait staff will help you in your desired meal. Tonight we had bamboo clams steamed to perfection with fried garlic in a fragrant soy sauce. The herbal drunken prawns were just rich! Our soon hock fish was deep fried to a crispy outside and soft insides bathed in a lovely sauce

I have been patronizing this place for the last 10 years. You pick your own seafood and they will cook it for you. Guaranteed freshness! My favourite are the bamboo clams and salted egg crab. Yummy! Great place to get together with friends and family. Service is prompt too.

Decided to explore The Grandstand on Good Friday but because I don’t drive and I do not want to take a cab there, my wife and I decided to catch the free shuttle bus at one of the pick up point at Clementi Road Blk 116. Do note that other than their main pick up points outside the MRT stations the bus will not stop unless you flag it down. You can check out the shuttle bus schedule at The Grandstand's website.We reached there at about 2.15pm and headed towards Owen Seafood Restaurant for our lunch. For a start my wife ordered two fresh oysters for herself as I do not eat oysters especially raw ones. But for some reasons that day I decided to give it a try and ate a small slice of it. After dipping it into the chili sauce to mask it original taste it actually tasted quite good. My wife loved the oysters so much that she ordered another two more.Next is the bamboo clam with garlic which is the best I had so far. The bamboo clams together with roasted garlic and the special sauce come together to form the perfect combination. I will be very happy with just this dish alone and a bowl of rice. Still feeling hungry we ordered claypot bean curd and stewed Ee-fu noodles with snow crab. The claypot bean curd tastes average and I suspect the chef uses the same sauce for cooking hor fun noodles. As for the Ee-fu noodles you won’t be able to find it in the menu and you have to ask from the server. For $26.90 I find it slightly overpriced, as it does not come with the whole crab. Nevertheless I will definitely be back for the bamboo clam

I went to Owen Seafood a couple of months back with my family for a feast to celebrate my birthday. My family enjoys dining at the Turf City area as the parking there is really convenient, free and the food there tastes really good too!!Among the different branches of seafood restaurants available there, our favourite has always been Owen Seafood. They've a variety of live seafood there for your choosing! The ordering method is simple, just choose your own seafood from their allocated tanks and decide on the cooking style. There's endless varieties available there so you need not worry if you're afraid of the same taste every time you're there!(Full article on www.tylerhikaru.com

Located within Turf City, Owen restaurant is huge. Ideal for large group dinning like company dinners or family dinners. It is more fun to patronise in a big group as you get to savour larger items and more. We were awed by the wide selection of live seafood at the back of the restaurant. You get to choose your own seafood. If like us, you don't know how to select fresh seafood, no worries, the staff will help you with the selection. All you have to do is to name your pick.After selection, head back to the restaurant and the servers will assist you with your preferred method of preparing the dishes. The servers are dedicated to serve a couple of tables which is good. As the table for 2 pax is very small, our server seeing that we were still enjoying our appetizers, helped to ask the kitchen to hold our crab order until we are done with our oysters. We ordered half a dozen of small oysters at $4.50 each. 400g of sea white prawns at $35 and 660g of mud crab at $32. It's a pity that we could not order more as there's only so much that we could eat

Had a value deal for a 9-course dinner for 6 people with 4 people, so I think the portion for 4 people is just nice, but if for 6 people the portion may not be enough.We had the following menu items:- Braised Shark Fin soup with crabmeat (average)- Peking Duck (good)- Scallop on melon (good)- Fried Garoupa with special sauce (good)- Fried Prawns in special sauce (poor - not so fresh)- Hong Kong cabbage with wolf berries in Superior stock (average)- Fried Ee-fu noodles with mushrooms (good)- Fried duck is spicy sauce (average)- Cheng Ting as dessert (average)Location is beside Ah Yat Seafood restauran
