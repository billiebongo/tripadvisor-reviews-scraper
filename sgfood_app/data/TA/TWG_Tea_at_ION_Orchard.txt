Went to TWG for lunch. Zeus is such a nice and polite waiter. I am very please with his service and recommendation for the main course.
If anyone go to TWG should look for Zeus as your server.
5
I always enjoy going to twg. Their food is tasty no matter which item you order from the menu. The tea is yummy and service is friendly
5
The best lunch I've ever had. My only disappointment is the tables arrangement were very close to each other..
4
they sold many kind of tea from all over the world.... quite pricey but you can get good quality of tea, their maccarone is very nice.
5
Was at TWG last December to do my Christmas shopping. One of the staff—her name is Siana—was incredibly kind and helpful. She provided me with many useful recommendations with a constant smile on her face. Thanks to her, I was able to finish my Christmas shopping. Kudos also to the two male managers who were very kind as well. You guys are doing a great job! Hope that the management can recognize the efforts of staff like Siana because sometimes it's the little things that matter the most (
5
thanks to Jobert for the excellent service. he is courteous, attentive and fast. We enjoyed our macarons and of course the tea.

I have been TWG Tea at ION Orchard today. Twg tea was my first visit and I did not know what to buy. An employee greeted me with a smile and kindly explained the taste of tea in detail. Originally I went to there for window shopping. However, with the kind hospitality of the staff, I bought a lot of different kinds of things such as tea sets and candle unexpectedly. The tea is of course will be very good, but I am very grateful to the staff who introduced me a good tea. I want to strongly praise the staff. Her name is Wonjung Kwon. Thank you

This is feedback for my first experience at TWG cafe at Ion orchard mall. I had a lovely time having jasmine oolong tea and Singapore breakfast. Our server Jhudie served as well. But one turn off was thatIt's a must for every person on the table to order a beverage. This kind of push for sale is not appreciated
5
We were treated to an absolutely fabulous afternoon tea at TWG, the most gorgeous sandwiches, tea and cakes, served by diligent delightful staff.I can't recommend it enough, the tea was fragrant and delicious, equal to any I have ever had anywhere.Popular and therefore busy, TWG are a class act and a visit here simply has to be done
5
We’ve visited TWG on a couple of occasions now and really do love the place. It’s sophisticated and a great place to people watch. The list of TWG teas is just mind bogglingly amazing, and watching your choice being retrieved from the wall cabinets and lovingly served is part of the experience.On this occasion I had the substantial Club Sandwich and the almond tea. My wife had the tasty Monsieur Truffle and the crème brulee tea. It was great to relax and savour the experience. The tea flavours are out of this world. We’ll be back
5
Needless to say, the service at TWG is always good. Waiters and waitresses are at their best. The lobster sandwich was absolutely delicious. The Chic afternoon tea was delightful and their French Earl Grey was top-notch.
5
A good selection with the menu. Good food, quiet part of the shopping centre to enjoy your cup of tea. We went back for breakfast the next morning because we enjoy the food and venue very much. Thanks TWG.
5
Shopping around and looking for some tea to buy back, Charles from Ion orchard TWG is patient in explaining the types of tea and provided good service. Great job !
5
Charles , good service show me with good attitude. With japanese speaking . Oishii おいしい 親切丁寧 チョコレートもあります。
です
5
An afternoon tea to remember for all the right reasons. Fine teas, cakes, scones with jam and cream, with linen table cloths and silver service. Memorable!
5
we had lunch and it was really good, the place is very well designed and if you have the time to visited try it
4
Amazing place located at the second floor having big variety of tea or flavoured tea with chocolate even ice tea with mango and many varieties
If you have time you can enjoy drinking any kind of tea
2
Ordered the Parisian high tea set for 2 ($68 +++) which comes with 2 small scones, 1 turkey ham sandwich (cut into quarters), 4 finger sandwiches (no bigger than 3cm each) and a slice of berry fruit tart and 2 pots of tea (we chose sencha green tea and orange blossom oolong). The menu is full of words which you kind of give up reading after 1/2 a page. The tea menu is like a mini encyclopedia and it would probably take me at least 3 hours to go through it if I want to be picky about my tea selection. Good information on tea but do you want your customers to be seated there for so long to place an order? Anyway, was rather disappointed with the food (everything was just average except for the turkey ham sandwiches which both my friend and I like). The tea was nice but do you know that the pot of tea is just tea, without any tea leaves in the pot??? This is the 1st time I have been served a pot of tea in a cafe/restaurant that serves tea in a pot without a teabag or tea leaves!!! I actually felt cheated *sigh*. Our tea turned cold very quickly as we were seated directly under an aircon vent. The young lady staff who served us was very polite. Our bill came up to $80 for two. I think I can get a better high tea/meal elsewhere and will probably not be back again.
5
The decor is magical, they truly have the finest teas in the world. The scones are delicious as are the macaroons. It's expensive but it's a once in a life time opportunity to step back in time, to the days when we all sat down for teas and scone. Ahhhhh bliss so magical!
4
If you are a heavy eater, this is not the place for you. I tried their mini burgers and ordered some of their cakes. They offer limited dishes in their menu. They don't serve coffee so don't ask for coffee when you visit this place. I am not a tea person actually but I appreciate tea now. I love the aroma of their tea collection. Now, I have an idea what gift should I buy for the elders on Christmas. TWG. The service is excellent and the staff are friendly
5
Their branding was really good! Quality matches their fame! I got 3 types of tea, and it has been a month, I finished them and would like to go back to purchase more varieties!
3
My friend suggested tea here after some frantic shopping. The tea and scones were very good, reminiscent of London. Good but pricey by Singapore standards. Moreover TGW is in a busy mall.
4
I went there several times with my friends, a nice place to sit down and chat with friends, and the staff are also kind, the dish is petty delicious and price is reasonable, tea tastes not bad but below my expectation. The macaroon is also worth a shot by the way
4
We had the tea, burger and cake menu. Small and tasteful burgers with very tender meat. If you're very hungry it's not this menu you should pick.. the burgers are more like an appetizer. I had a Japanese green tea and it was great. Remember they put 17% on top of the listed price, that's probably normal but I didn't see it before I got the bill
2
After visiting TWG shops in Dubai and Thailand, we wanted to take a sample of their huge tea variety from TWG homeland.Our enthusiasm was killed by an arrogant French salesman who seemed be anything but happy to do business with us. Our plan to try different tea types and scents before choosing two or three varieties to take back home seemed too much of a nuisance for this gentlemen, who seemed to be out of patience and behaved as if he was too much for us.Unfortunately, our experience was totally different from other TWG shops, where we were received by smiley people willing to spend some time and make business with us
2
I bought some of their products like cookies ....for the matcha version, I find it too tough, I need to melt it with hot tea for better consumption....I seriously don't think the fragrance of green tea is strong enough as wellDefinitely not worth another round of effor
1
I have had a very unpleasant experience here. While purchasing the goods and making tax free documents, I asked the staff "Do I get a refund at the airport?" The staff then nodded once, without looking at me and without answering. The attitude that she responded to the guest was very unfriendly. I felt bad about her rudeness, but Ishe was pregnant when I saw her belly. So I just came out. She was the only unfriendly person I met while traveling to Singapore
5
We almost every month be there for Lunch with my Husband or my best friend's- Pan Hong. We always enjoyed it. Among all the staff was very friendly and nice, they knew us cause we are regular guest there. Most of the food we been tried and we love ❤️ the TWG Tea there, so every time will order -3~4 pot of the Tea ☕️. And arrange spend about $150 for 2pax. Quite expensive.. But right now they change to New Menu we seldom be there, because our favourite Salad and Dessert not serving anymore... Hope that can get back the some dishes from the old menu. Thank you From : J&M

After dinner in Ion I decided to have desserts at TWG. By the way TWG is a fairly recent Singapore-based company:).The Lap Chang was smokey and nice. It is good to know a tea pot can be shared between two as otherwise I would overdose on tea.The desserts were great. The selection at Ion was smaller than MBS. The dark chocolate tart came with delicious chocolate ice cream, and was sensational for chocolate lovers. All five macaroons were nice although they were as good as the best Parisian
3
Good to try the variety of teas and tea flavored desserts. The main courses are average . Tried the Duck which was good that day. Located in the middle of the mall so not a great setting
3
My wife and I came here for afternoon tea and while we did enjoy ourselves, nothing was quite as good as we expected. The scones were dry and tough (over worked and over baked) and the Ceylon OP tea was too light.
5
Having been to TWG in a number of countries where I thought it quaint and ok and limited ourselves to buying exotic teas, I did not expect more in its home town of Singapore. I was wrong. After a heavy late afternoon shopping we dropped in for a snack. I had a mushroom quiche and my wife a croque Monsieur both with a good salad together with Japanese green tea. It was really good and served immaculately in the old style. Congratulations to the chefs and the waiters - it was a small but real treat. Of course, we took home some French earl grey and some macaroons for later
4
A small and compact (enclosed) tea room in the centre of ION shopping Mall. This place probably carries a lot of history, tradition and expectation. The tea room is well stocked with an incredibly impressive list of teas from all over the world - and note the minimum order is for 1 pot. They have cakes and an a la carte menu as well. This place is expensive but pretty good with a good service and great macaroons. I paid $23 for a pot of Darjeeling and $2 each on the macaroons. I was happy; the only thing letting it down was it is cramped for space
5
It was my first experience and I love everything about it. Yes it costly for a tea but it worth every single penny. I went there for tea time and ordered Finger Sandwiches which I enjoyed every bites of it, soooo delish. The service is great, friendly and well groomed staff.
1
I've always been an avid fan of the tea sets and ambience of TWG at MBS, so it is understandable why I would be so disappointed at the attitude displayed at its Ion branch.This waiter arrogantly told my friend and I that the signature TWG scones were sold out and that "you are too late laaahhhh~~(singlish), next time try to come earlier". Towards the end he was scorning at us. He told us to come back another time if we want the scones, when we are already seated and did nothing to give further recommendations.I highly recommend going to MBS's branch, because it is so much more spacious. The incident was not made any better when we were made to dine in such a tight space; my friend almost hit the teapot at the other table while trying to get up from her seat.
2
It is with a heavy heart that I write this. I have been a supporter of TWG Tea for a number of years as it's a Singapore company. In fact, since its founding by Manoj Murjani and his partners about 10 years ago or so. I didn't mind that all the Frenchiness was surreal and that the company was not established in 1837 at all. It was all a bit of "pretend" and make belief we are in Paris. But it was fun. I have been to the cafes in Takashimaya, Ion and MBS Bridge several times. I have found the experience pleasant. Nice Macarons and cakes. Good tea and drinks. Even interesting wagyu burgers and truffle fries. We sometimes just have tea and we sometimes just have food. And sometimes we have both. All was well until last month. On 27 June, a friend and I were at the Ion branch. We had ordered sandwiches and a wagyu burger. We were then told by the wait staff that we would also have to order a drink each. However, as a special favor to us, he would allow us to order just one drink and not two. He said ordering drinks was a company policy and pointed to a clause in the menu. The clause says that we cannot share a pot of tea. It didn't say we had to order drinks. However, as I didn't want to spoil my meal with my friend, I complied without arguing too much and we ordered an orange juice. I believe the staff member was French.I am sad that TWG allows staff to do this. As customers, we feel forced, as no such policy is stated at the entrance. And I have in fact happily ordered drinks when not forced to do so. I have since that day avoided TWG cafes and will not be returning. Thankfully, there are many other places to eat and drink in Singapore
5
I tried their macarons and fell in love. Best macarons in the world. In fact, I was upset that I didn't buy the box and found a store at the airport. I tried lemon, rose, raspberry, mint and coconut, passion fruit etc. Yummy. I want to fly to Singapore again just to eat the macarons
4
Was doing Christmas shopping at ION. There's 2 TWG outlets within ION. One of the cafe was fully occupied. Went to the other one.Decided to have afternoon tea there. Ordered Russian Earl Grey & English Breakfast with some macaroons. The tea were smooth went well with the different flavours macaroons. Simply fantastic. Enjoyed. Truly enjoyed
4
I was craving for macaron for a few days and read so many good reviews about how cheap it is, no force for minimum buy etc. I decided to give it a shot. I ordered ; moroccan mint, sakura and earl gray to tried. The shells was little too soft and already cracked when they packed it. I have to hold it gently while eating. Taste was nice though. The ganache was perfect. It wasn't too runny or to sticky. I like Moroccan Mint the best. Sakura was my second. Earl Grey was too sweet but nice smell of high quality tea. The staffs were all nice and friendly.
5
I love to drink tea and knew TWG has great selection and tea. Visited this place with friends and OMG!!! their tea menu is 4 full pages and if you are a tea addict, Im sure you will love this place. I had white tea and they gave you colorful macaron to accompany you while enjoying the tea too . The cafe design is very classy and elegant. Love it
4
Upscale tea snacks and service
Incredible choice of teas served nicely
Had eggs benedict not as good as the Wolsey London or mount nelson Cape Town or the cliff Barbados but nearly in that league
Singapore elite lifestyle at its best
5
I am an "old" customer of TWG for their awesome and huge choice of teas (the one with cherry blossom if my favourite).I recently went there for a brunch, and had a very good experience! I took the club royale which was PERFECT, a club sandwich with smoked salmon, really tasty/light (with a nice sauce and vegetables). My best sandwich experience in Singapore!Afterwards I took the cheesecake with forest fruits - awesome and so good looking on the plate (see pictures). Definitely going back for another Sunday brunch
4
If you love tea, you'll love this place - the variety is amazing! From same type of tea grown from different continents, to blends to decaffeinated flower tea, almost everything you can think of - it's there. The brunch menu is great as well, I've taken an open sandwich set, and the blend of the flavors is amazing. Great place if you're tired after walking for endless hours at ion
4
Great food and deserts and literally 1000's of teas to choose from. I always stop here when in Singapore to buy tea and accessories even if I don't have time to stop to eat
4
Worth the queueing up just for the experience alone! Though on weekends the line can be a bit crazy. They specialise in tea so expect a massive tea menu to order from and be sure to ask for a recommendation if you do get a bit confused. I always order fresh scones with tea jelly and clotted cream to go with the tea, but there's also light snacks if you do get hungry. P.S- Service can be a bit slow though since it's a busy place pretty much any time of the day
3
Very interesting selection of Teas. Do try the SIngapore Bfast tea. Great as souvenir to take home. Service is very indifferent and robotic as is with service in general in Singapore. Very expensive for an afternoon tea. More of a special treat. I assumed that the inspiration for this concept must have come from "Mariagge" Paris. TWG should learn how to serve and treat their customers like in Marriagge as well.
1
I always think that TWG Tea will be great place for a mini break but, when we went into the restaurant, we felt uncomfortable. It was because TWG staffs seem to not welcome us into the restaurant. My boyfriend and I wanted to just try out some TWG desserts and also try one type of tea (because we had a heavy lunch, so we think that eating a little while drinking just few cup of tea will be enough for us.) When we order, TWG waiter was giving the face which seem to be telling me that "why did we order so little? No money eat is it?" At that moment, I really feel like walking out of the restaurant. When our tea order came, your TWG waitress asked me this question,"So only one pot share with two person?" and I answered yes. In my mind, I was like..CAN'T WE SHARE? As it was our first time experience in TWG, we asked whether we can refill our pot of tea and your waiter said no, we can't. Then I was like it's okay and I'm fine with it. But after the waiter said no, we heard giggling from the other waiters and manager. IT'S MY FIRST TIME WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN EMBARRASSING MOMENTS. After paying, the TWG manager, I assumed, came to me and said this," Hi, how's your meal?" and he started laughing. Dear TWG Tea,May I know what did I do wrong? May I know why should I accept such ridiculous act of your manager and your staffs? Do I look like I can't pay for my meal? Did I eat for free in TWG? Who are you to judge me? So what I am a student? Am I not welcome to TWG? I will never understand why would the TWG Tea management let this happen. Even though, overall the food was very good but, I don't really think that I would go TWG ever again as it left me with bad memories
2
The tea taste nice but when have no idea what to choose from long confusing menu the staff recommend the expensive one. Also they charge one pot per person as minimum charge so can't share and don't be fooled by the pot size as it is not full of tea, may be it is hust quarter of the pot volume.
4
We stopped in for a light meal and ended up with a nice bottle of champagne, an Asian chicken salad and coq au vin. Delicious!Pricey yes.Service was a bit off as these were just kids. They did ok but struggled with champagne service. Okay, it's a tea shop....
1
I feel uncomfortable to some store clerks. The blond hair man changed his face as I asked the cheaper tea and didn't give a desribe anymore. The chashier women said 'no' first with high-handed attitude and tried not to cancel when I asked to cancel the credit card approval caused by the tax refund problem. I think TWG must strenthen employ education on the Ion Orchard store
1
When I choose expensive tea, they are smile. But when I change my mind to cheaper tea, they changed their faces. I feels very unkindly.
I high recommend to go other branches like Marina Bay Sands branch. They were very kind.
5
This establishment serves the most wonderful selection of fine teas but I decided to cool down with an lovely iced tea - very refreshing. also great selection of tea-inspired macarons (the passionfruit was divine).
2
What can I say except this is a pretentious place with a brand that offers good quality tea and exorbitant price. Food is so average.
1
We love our tea and love exploring new venues, new teas and ways of presenting. So we looked forward to our planned visit to TWG. But a huge disappointment. A fantastic range of teas and we had zero expectations about how it is served. Just hoped world tea standard would be sort of used. The waitress insisted the tea was served from boiling water at the 90-95C range. Either she did not care or she knows little about water temperature but when we told her it was just warm - I reckon about 60/65 - she insisted it was just right. We wanted to leave immediately as there is no thrill in drinking luke warm tea no matter how stylish the place. In fact, I reckon there is an inverse relationship between stylish places and quality of food/drinks and ambience. This was the best example. Nice to visit but we would not waste time or money there again.
5
Most complete tea selection I've ever seen. All are done well.Please note, that when you get the tea there is no teabag (so don't ask for extra hot water!). You need to order a whole new pot (and pay).Desserts were supreme. My wife ordered a chocolate dessert and it came with a tiny piece of gold leaf on top. Never had a bad experience here.Service is above-average.Not cheap. Expect to fork out more than you expect
4
If you are looking for tea, then this is the place to get it. Expensive, but not overly for a good sample, yet you can spend a lot of money in here. Very friendly staff, even if just window shopping. They also have a cafÃ© and light meal facility. Maybe try before you buy? This is a must see
1
I came in to the Ion branch last Friday struggling with 7 bags and the restaurant waiters (who were all standing around chatting) did not bother to help me with them. I ordered a pot of tea (which is truly overpriced! SGD23 for a pot of tea) only to find out it was not refillable. And when i left, none of them again bothered to help me with my bags to the taxi stand. Instead the porter rushed over to help. Zero initiative shown by snotty waiters (I cannot see why they would be that way), super expensive tea and far too noisy with piped in music that played the same songs over and over again. I wanted to have dinner there as well but looking at how the waiters and management were, we went upstairs for dinner instead. Visit the Marmalade Pantry upstairs please and get tip top service and far better beverages. I am appalled by the lack of service and how over rated this place is
5
What can I say, this is great ambience at TWG. Even though its located within a large posh mall, while at TWG, you feel part of that lovely intimate space rather than the large mall, kudos to the designer.The tea wares are super!! Dig the high tea here.I was in transit at Singapore and my freind suggested we go there for alittle while. But felt so relaxed, didnt really feel like going and doing the touristy stuff anymoreThanks TWG for the experience. Oh BTW, great tea and chocs
5
Had tea and scones for one after a busy afternoon of shopping. Very personalized service and attention to detail. The tea recommended for me was perfect. Was it cheap? No - but the quality was absolutely worth it. Bought some tea in the retail store afterwards - tea itself priced accordingly although I thought the cost of the tea caddy was a bit on the high side
1
The place is so small and tables are so close to each other. Not an ideal place for business or serious discussion. Cosy though. Tea and food wise ~ if you have tasted TWG teas, then you have tasted them and all other outlets taste the same! Therefore, the place and ambience is important in my selection of TWG outlets.
4
Had the afternoon tea with my son while my other female family members go ravaging on a shopping spree. The quality of tea is indeed good but price is on a high side. A good place to relax while waiting for others.
3
A local brand that has done well for itself regionally, this is 1 of 2 cafés in Ion alone . The range of teas is mind boggling , literally hundreds of blends, with prices starting from a regular $5 to $50 a cup/pot. There's a lot of tea time food to go with the tea - cakes, scones, macaroons etc. There's also always the take away counter for you to buy tea, food, jams etc
4
They have an astounding number of tea strains at this venue. Though it can be a tad bit pricey for a pot of tea, the variety is absolutely amazing. Its a great place for tea lovers, and to spend an afternoon with a friend chatting
2
Totally disappointed when I went to buy scones for takeaway today. The clotted cream and tea jelly which come with scones if you dine in are NOT available for takeaway. What are scones without these condiments?! I would definitely suggest going to other cafes as they do provide condiments even if you buy only one scone. Only found out after payment, I would NOT have bought these if I know beforehand. Lots of other cafes around orchard and provides better service for takeaway
5
Don't let the name food you - they serve a lot more than tea and everything there is superb. We wanted an early evening light dinner and this was exactly the right spot. It is beautiful, quiet even though it is in a very busy mall, the service was above and beyond excellent and the food was superb - particularly the desserts. We highly recommend this restaurant and if you're a tea lover, you will be in heaven
5
Had lunch with my wife and satisfied with the food, tea and service. Nice place but tables too close for comfort. Had to move since the queue was long waiting for empty tables
5
TWG has the most delicious teas, service and food. I loved the Lasagna, Cheesecake and Macarons. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful
3
Food is the same as the other branches... Arrangement of tables are too close for comfort. Due to the wide open atrium, can be a little warm
3
to me its just a high class tea house with high grade cakes and desserts. at some locations the staff can be rather impatient and dont bother to smile. my best experience were the branches at MBS i patronised. always smiley and proffesional
5
i love this place a tea haven for me.. a lot of luxurious variety of tea selections! nice place to chill out.
5
TWG Tea Salons are a chain located all over Singapore and a great place to stop for a light lunch and they make an excellent cup of tea.
1
Okay, I really don't understand what is the fuss about, this place sucks!! We were in a group of 6 and just wanted to find somewhere nice to seat. Who would've have thought we walked into the Queen's tea room or something, there was a little bit of crowd but it is not crowded and the waiter guy told us we have to wait at least 1 hour which I can clearly see tables available. So I argue and he went in for like 5 mins, came out and told me with his head held high 'mam, you are SUPER LUCKY today because you got a table.' We sat down and wanting to order, the same guy just glared at us and walk pass, he clearly see me waving at him, and apprently we were transparent to all the waiter. I got so angry I stood up and went to cahsier and order from there and they told me to sit down and somebody will take my order instead. I told the cashier if it was that easy I wouldnt even bother walking to the cashier! All of the staffs are rude, im not kidding when I say, they think that they are the QUEEN! And being served by them is an honoured. However when I found out that TWG is Singapore company I laughed so hard and actually pity them, acting all high and mighty for nothing. NOT RECOMMENDED BTW! I'd rather go starbucks!
5
This is such an amazing place for many things! They have great selection of tea, over 3000 types if i'm not mistakes, they have a pretty good high tea! Service is always excellent. I dont think they take reservations at any of its outlets though, so the wait can be quite long on public holidays and weekends.
5
I make no apology for liking nice things that cost a little more, but I am on holiday and so a splurge here or there is OK. I love TWG's tea and the food is such an added bonus. My GF had the summer quiche and loved it (She has had this at 3 locations in 3 cities and always says its wonderful) and I had the Fios Gras which was divine. The staff are nothing short of brilliant at this location and helped pick out the best tea's for our pallets for the meals and then after when we brought more to bring back home. I have never been disappointed with any TWG but this location is top 3 and we have been to a lot
4
The TWG café/restaurant, effectively in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall, doesn't sound like a great location. There's no view to speak of, the passing crowds are not that interesting and why go the this high end mall in the first place ? However, if you're in that part of town (for instance, to visit the nearby museum or the gardens across the way) and you're looking for somewhere to relax and to enjoy a really good cup of tea, TWG (the acronym that The Wellbeing Group uses for its locations and products) is the place to go. I've tried Raffles (awful for surroundings and refreshment), Fullerton on the Bay (interesting venue, moderate tea), the Fullerton Hotel itself (odd lobby space, also moderate tea) among others but nowhere else delivers like TWG. Just one example may explain why. When I asked for Earl Grey the response was "certainly but which one ?" as there is a great selection. Service is OK, decoration is classy, presentation is excellent, prices are high but the satisfaction that results makes it very worthwhile
4
I expected the taste of macaron. However, the macaron is worse than that of my country.Instead, the strawberry tart is best thing I 've been at
5
I honestly never knew that there were so many teas in the world! It would have taken me hours to read through their catalogue. I would have loved to be able to buy a copy of it
2
The tea is average and their service people restricting you from photos is ridiculous. You have a beautiful shop, get over yourselves and let us photograph it. It's good advertising, what is it hurting you
3
TWG claims to have the finest teas in the world and I've bought their tea leaves and enjoyed them at home. But even the best teas will disappoint from lack of brewing knowledge. While I've always enjoyed the Geisha Blossom Blend, what I received was a disappointing lukewarm diluted tea that didn't even taste of green tea (which is its base). The other tea was Eternal Summer, a fruit tea. Therefore, it was stronger and acidic. It was brewed properly, but the waiter had recommended it to my mom. Most elderly Asian ladies don't like strong flavours, and I should have asked the waiter about what flavour and base the tea was. The waiter said each person had to order one tea each ($11 and above). I told him that we didn't drink much, so he was ok with us ordering two for three people. However, this requirement didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, because this wasn't indicated anywhere on the menu. We also discovered that the big teapots only hold an equivalent of about one small mug of tea, and there's no refilling allowed.For food, we ordered the Wagyu burger ($24) and Cod ($28). A little bit on the small side (but ok for small eaters like me), the Wagyu burger was tender despite being cooked medium-well. It came salad and delicious fries. I think the fries was flavoured with truffle oil, but I can't be too sure. The cod was yummy, flaky and well-cooked. It was served in a savoury blueberry sauce, but there was some flavoured salt topping the cod too, so the combination made it too salty.I found the service lukewarm and average, the type of service you would get at lower end restaurants like Thai Express. The waiters would do well to remember little things like handing things to customers with both hands, or not passing things across the table.However, if you'd still like to try this place, go to the one with the orchids at MBS, because there are two outlets there. At least you would have paid for the view. Otherwise, there are much better places with better value, service and carefully brewed delicious teas
4
The creme brulee is infused with two different types of tea and they are very small but very good! I would say its a bit pricey but the atmosphere is nice and the food was also
4
They are famous for their tea and macaroons. I bought all the different flavours of macaroons here (1each) and it had a crispy texture on the outside and chewy on the inside.
4
great getting tea in a pot ,
too many choices would be happy to pay for a tasting session with different types
5
I think Most delicate tea brand is TWG. There are few options to treat tea and scones like afternoon tea. I love green tea blended with some fruits...
5
Small cozy tea salon right in the middle of a gigantic shopping centre. The view of waterfalls and indoor canal with gondolas are very pleasant
5
After a long day, it was nice to have a quiet and elegant dinner somewhere cool and quiet. I had the Salmon, presentation quite nice. Good variety
3
I wanted to visit here as i had such a great experience in the TWG salon in Dubai.Tea was made weak, desserts were cold (when they are meant to be warm), waiter cleared my plates before my partner was finished.it was very pricey but still provded an elegant feel
4
We return to this store time and time again for the range, quality and superb packaging of delicious teas. The tearoom/cafe at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes is a great experience, delicate scones, sandwiches and of course, the huge range of teas. My only comment about the store (Marina Bay Sands Shoppes and also the Changi Airport store, is that the staff appear arrogant, disinterested in the customer (despite many purchases) and make you feel as though you are wasting their time asking questions when trying to select something different. I was trying to choose a mint tea as a gift, unsure between Alexandria or Moroccan Mint (our personal favourite): gave up trying to discuss with the salesman at Marina Bay Sands, tried again at the airport but felt the same, total disinterest in customer service. It's a shame as this store is visually sensational and wonderful products. I noticed the same (lack of) service last visit to Singapore about 18 months ago

TWG tea shop is my favourite supplier of tea in the whole world. The flavours, the service and expertise are unmatched. Every time I am in Singapore I make this place top of the list to visit to stock up my supplies and to relax in the decadent surroundings.The TWG tea café is luxurious and oozes decadence and indulgence. The service is prompt and there is always a line up for the café. When I arrived around 3pm the line was long, I shopped around Marina Bay and returned there close to 9pm and there was no line up. We ate dessert and needed assistance from the knowledgeable waiter to pick a tea. You will see the extensive and long list of teas available and trust me if you have not tried them all, you will also need assistance.Tea lover, make this top priority in Singapore – if you haven’t already

There is always a time to pause for a cup of tea, and after discovering TWG in Singapore... My love of tea has grown.Here having tea is an art form and a truly wonderful experience that one should take up every single day!! And you can!! Every possible kind of tea that you could ever imagine is here and no wonder TWG is called the Finest Teas of the World!! Accompany your tea with one of the many mouth watering and delicious cakes...simply heaven! Not only can you have the tea of your choice, there are so many gifts that you could by for friends and family. A really great and unique gift idea. Something unexpected. Take your time when smelling all the teas that they have to offer, you should definitely find one that suits your taste. My personal favorite is Earl Grey, but the normal Earl Grey is just one variation of this tea! I bought a great gift set... For myself of course, Every city should have a tea salon like this and every time I sip on my TWG tea... I smile.
3
I had late lunch but did not order the tea set as initially planned to. We had chicken sandwich (~$20) and eggs benedict (~$19) and 2 cups of tea (~$11-14.50) per pot. We ended off with macarons at $2 each which surprised me a little as I normally see them sold at other cafes for $3 or more. The quality of food and tea are average for the price. Bill for 2 of us was $80.Ambience at TWG Ion is great. Service crew could be more friendly and welcoming. I'll prefer going for hotel high tea sets or buffet which has higher perceived value
1
Being egotistic to qualify your customers will not go long way in business. Customer like us can switch to other premium brands as long as we are happy with our purchases.
5
TWG offers a great range of aromatic tea, a friendly and helpful staff, and a great ambience to relax! i am going over and over again!
3
Visited TWG yesterday and found that the ambience was lovely, perhaps because of the atas setting. However, the ala carte items are not value for money and service was so so only.
3
We ate at the restaurant at Marina Bay Sands shopping centre.Nice ambiance, but the food was so-so. Reasonably tasty, but not piping hot by the time it got to us from the kitchen.Good fun choosing a yea from the hundreds on offer to accompany you dish
1
We've been going to this place for more than two years. We also buy tea leaves there for the last two years regularly. The last batch of English breakfast tea leaves we purchased would not make a nice cup of tea. The tea was weaker and with less taste. No problem, we thought, we took the bag back into the store with our receipt. The store refused to even test the tea and then pointed to fine print on the back of the receipt that said they would not refund or exchange. We were then lectured by the tea person on how we must be wrong and we must not have brewed correctly. It did not matter at all that we have been regularly buying leaves there for two years and making tea successfully all that time. Suddenly, we must be the problem and not their product. So, they refused to do anything. We will never go back. Ever.
5
One lazy morning we decided to try the TWG brunch at MBS or Marina Bay Sands. The place was beautiful decorated with a excellent location over the 'rivers ' inside MBS. We tried the gourmet set with truffled scrambled eggs/ salmon snd prawn and the Veal Brunch set. The chef was truly gifted and we really enjoyed our food. Had a great morning 
5
I love teas. I'm addicted to teas, and TWG has so many awesome teas. I love the fact that they have book describing every tea that they carry. Not to mention all the delicious tea infused dishes. Never dissapointing. However, although the service was superb, they dont have baby chair.. i guess it wasnt designed as family restaurant
5
Coming and visiting one a year Singapore I never miss a visit to one of the TWG Tea Salon and Boutique, specially the one located in ION ORCHARD. Its my favorite place after a shopping tour by Giorgio Armani to go there , buy tea boves for my friends in France and of cours emake a break by eating some nice house made cakes
3
If you're one to love the high-tea/charlie service experience, then this is a right place for you. However, I was a bit disappointed looking at what I paid for what I drank/ate. Firstly, a fairly knowledgeable but slightly arrogant server came forward and tried to push forth a very expensive pot of tea to me. Since I'm not a connoisseur of teas, I just settled for the flavoured Orange black tea, he was a bit miffed. Arrogance was obvious and attitude adjustment needed. The macaroons however are a delight, especially the chocolate and passionfruit flavours infused with a tea
5
first of all going with friends is a bonus...but their crab salad..that was even better then i thought possible...it was scrumptious and yumcious rolled into one!!service could have been a bit better...no need to be so snooty with paying customers..but the cakes and salad were worth it...i will still go back!!
4
they have many range of tea..... atmosphere very impresive.... waiter are friendly .... the cake also very nice... recommend for tea lover
4
The quality is excellent, but the prices are too high, and the fact that the price shown on the menu does not include the tax is quite annoying.
5
What an amazing place for afternoon tea! The choice of teas is awesome! The food was excellent, and the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable about the various teas.
4
One of the best tea joints ever visited ,real authentic collection of tasty tea.Afcourse it was costly but wonderful place to chill.
4
Very nice place to sit and relax while enjoying your tea and snacks as we came for afternoon tea. Very relaxing.
4
All macarons are of tea flavours. Textures and taste are good . Only S$2 . the best value thing of the shop . All other items including tea are extraordinary expensive. I love macarons so much then get a box from duty free in airport and tax free 
5
I am a loyal fan of twg 's macaroons and teas. Their "eternal summer iced tea" is a must try! Twg's macaroons are far less sweeter than other brands. It's always a fun affair to check out their tea collection and try a couple of them out to discover new treasures. Their Haute Couture tea collection are perfect for gifts too
3
I hate to say this about their food but it's true: it's definitely just a place for photo op. Everything looks better they taste.The place should stick to just 2 things: tea & desserts.it's actually a very nice place to hang out (especially the girls), but I say this again:People, stick to the teas, and cakes, and macaroons.On the plus side, the service was excellent though
4
Visited TWG with my parents for tea and spent almost $90 on tea and tea sets. Tea and atmosphere was excellent however customer service could be improved as we were not greeted and wait to the table when we arrive(only 2 occupied tables with at least 5 staffs). Staff could be friendlier with more smiles will be desirable.
4
As this place is primarily a tea shop, they have something like hundreds of solo tea and blended tea to choose from. I am not a tea connoisseur so this is always paralyzing when it comes to ordering. I would ask the waiter (they're quite knowledgeable) to explain several teas I want to try then base my selection on whether I would like strong or mild tea (depending on time of day). I find this helpful if you are going to be adventurous with this kind of money for a pot of tea. From S$11 up. My friend was not so lucky on the day we went there coz her tea was a bit too strong, thus bitter for her. While the pastries that came with the high tea set was nice, the rilletes were something I would avoid next time. On separate occasions I've tried fruit tarts and found it was not bad. Macaroons were okay but if I was craving macaroons this is not the place I would head too. Also had lunch on another occasion and the meals were something I cannot really remember afterwards, neither the name of the dish nor the taste. Overall we like the place for high quality tea selections served on exquisite china, relaxing ambiance created by beautiful decors and soothing music, and pleasant service. We would be back for tea, only for the tea.
3
Service was slow, choice was limited, portions were minute and price expensive. Much better alternatives.
5
Great place to have tea ever. Lots of selection of tea and the most I like it was the scones. It's the best ever taste!. Keep up the good job and please add more space in the MBS Mall since they are always full. :)
2
Service is poor, tried their beef main course. The sauce taste like rubber, and rubbery. Weird smell. Pastries so so. Not worth spending here.
The tea is good no doubt.
5
We often receive their teas while we are travelling and I always wanted to physically purchase tea from them as I like their taste - the tea is packed in cotton bags. What an experience to walk through their shop will all the different teas! Yes, I did manage to find teas which I liked :-)
4
TWG is probably one of the most tea place loved by many ppl over the world. More than 100 kinds of teas that have charming names such as the red of Africa, Secret, happy birthday, Pink garden, Sexy etc are def the best charm of this place. If you want something light, you can go for the scones. If you want something sweet, you can order the mini tea set to share with friends. ($35++). FYI, One pot of tea (not refillable) is $11 ~ $14
5
This is one hell of an experience for travelers. I'm a tea lover and TWG is the perfect tea salon. They have over a hundred tea varieties; name it, they got it. I love what the servers call the " White House Tea" because it's served at the White House. Another tea that's a must to try is the Silver Needle and the White Peony. Kinda pricey, but it's only peanuts for tea lovers !!! Try it !!
5
an extremely charming tea room admist beautiful setting of fresh fragrant flowers and serves vast variety of beverages , sumptuous macaroons along with other delectable desserts!A perfect place to catch up with friends or rejenuvate between a shopping spree, don't forget to get assorted macaroons for loved ones from here
3
The teas at TWG are no doubt really good. At the salon, you get delicious tea mocktails which I really enjoyed. However it is also one of the most expensive cup of tea you can have in Singapore. With 4 mocktails, we paid almost $60. To add to that, the service was average even though it was not all that busy. We had to try to get the attention of the wait staff a few times with much flailing of arms before we were noticed. Drinks were served at inconsistent times where one of our friends did not get theirs till the rest of us almost finished our drinks. The drinks by the way were small (way too small for the price we paid). Good place to hang out after a day of shopping as a treat, but if I wanted their teas, I should just buy some from their boutique for a better experience at home.
3
I was at the ground floor outlet of TWG at the Ion with a couple of friends last Oct 26.All in all a good experience. Great ambience...a little bit old English, a little bit Parisienne. Great atmosphere for a tea-a-tea, excuse the pun.Had the quiche with decaf tea. The quiche was huge but too light in consistency. The vanilla tea was from South Africa and really refreshing.Service? Hmmm...a couple were really great then there was the one spoilt apple who clearly wished he were somewhere else.TWG is The Way to Go
4
Visited this place thrice, I love the atmosphere of the place. All gold and brown colours. The tea pot is sooo nice. I ordered the Tea Time Set Menu which cost $35. The set came with little canapes and pastries on a tower. The canapes were excellent. The service here is exceptional since we were there on a weekday. If weekends, its gonna be busy. However, one point I note is they hire too many Filipinos, I don't see a single Singporean working there. Other then that, it's a good place to visit and relax
4
It was a really nice Parisian experience to be having a nice pot of tea with some delicious tea infused macaroons. Staff was courteous and knew well as to how to help me choose the perfect blend of tea for me.
5
This place alone is worth the trip to Singapore — the service was first-rate (they really make you feel special there!) and so were the macarons and pastries and teas. Couldn't be more pleased with the place!
5
A whole menu dedicated to tea and food options infused with tea, neatly placed in a beautiful surrounding filled with orchids! Best spot for tea in Singapore.
5
We had a lovely lunch here whilst visiting Singapore. The setting is beautiful. The food was fresh and the tea selection extensive. I had a sparkling wine with a tea infusion which was excellent. The Wagu Burger was very tasty.
4
We'd never heard of TWG until we had lunch in their Hong Kong restaurant, and their facility in the Marina Bay hotel complex over the 'canal' looked appealing... and didn't disappoint
4
Wife always wanted to visit and try the place, so we did finally... very nice ambiance, staff was also very accomodating and pleasant. we had the teatime set(which incluuded 2 muffins and 1 pot of tea). I had the orange wood tea? which was a nice. had a very subtlle orange and woody notes to it. hehe. and of course my wife had the moroccan mint which is nice to drink on a very nice evening. muffins are alright. :)Overall, we had a good experience and will come back again next time to try other stuff
5
I cant say enough about the service at TWG #01-29 at the ION. Since our return to Singapore in 2012 we would have no reason to visit any other tea house. Firstly the service is impeccable. The experienced staff, mainly from the Philippines, have excellent manners and courtesy and even anticipate patrons needs. Initially my family and i were apprehensive about this establishment due to constant queues, and ostentatious appearance, but the staff kept us constantly advised and assured. The tea range is unsurpassed ( please do not order English Breakfast , you can get this anywhere!!!) and I would strongly recommend the "Red Chai" which is very close to the real Indian taste, strong, mildly spiced with cardomom, but dont spoil it with milk.My children who are not tea drinkers absolutely love it. An Indian friend of mine claims his maid can prepare Chai just as well ...but since he refuses to go there , I must disagree.  At $11 a pot for 3 cups, I think it is a bargain. Matching this are the unique white sugar crystals. Their Tiramisu and Singapore Surprise are perhaps the best cakes I have eaten in Singapore.After no less than 25 visits to the premises, we are even treated to additional delicacies by the staff. A family of 4 with a serving of cake each and two pots of tea should cost between $70-$80 in total., I highly recommend a visit.....
4
Afternoon tea in the middle of busy mall? I was at first skeptical about this place when suggested my friend. Well, I was wrong. I truly enjoyed high tea here.Location: conveniently located at the inside the ION mall, L1 and L2, just escalator away from the Orchard subway station. Even though it is inside the busy mall once inside, you will enjoy quietness of the restaurant. Unlike those at five star hotels, (lobby area with many people walking by), glass wall keeps inside quiet.High tea experience: we ordered high tea set with several small sandwich and sweets in tiered trays. Everything I tasted was very good. We ordered additional macarons, they were so delicate and amazingly good. $2 each was very reasonable too. I normally pay more for macarons.Tea: I tried French Earl Grey. They are known for good tea and they are here to maintain their reputation. Only if I have room in my suitcase, I would definitely buy some to bring home.We stayed for a little over one hour and enjoyed leisurely afternoon with good conversation and amazing high tea. I would highly recommend high tea experience here over five star hotel
3
I tried a selection of macarons from the outlet at the Shoppes at Marina Bay and unfortunately I think due to Singapore's humidity they lacked the crunch one would expect from a macaron. Even popping them in the fridge didn't help which is a shame as the selection of colours and flavours is quite impressive
3
The tea selection was so extensive it took forever to read the menu but was great because you could try almost anything you could imagine. I was only in Singapore for a day but overall I thought everything here was expensive. Teas were ~$12. I wouldn't really suggest this for dinner if you wanted a large meal. Most options seemed to be a small serving size. Service was fine and decor and atmosphere were neat. It is in the middle of a shopping mall so prime people watching space
5
On a recent visit to Singapore, we enjoyed two occasions at the TWG Tea Salon - the opportunity to savour different varieties of tea served with fine tableware to accompany delicious luncheon dishes was realised. Quite a different experience!
4
If you love tea this is the place. They literally have 1000s of variety. I had the Smoky Earl Grey. Superb. Their Strawberry Tart was fantastic.
White linen service was good with attentive service.
I went to the one at Ion Mall in Orchard.
4
This company has the most extensive selection of tea we have ever seen. For someone who does not make decisions easily, it may take something to stop here. We visited this location for the first time - it is amazing how they have created this oasis in the middle of a major shopping mall. The Staff is attentive and it is delightful to watch the "tea-maker" with this huge selection of tea tins, create each individual service. I had ice tea for the first time and did not like it. I will stick with hot tea in the future. And we always love the experience with this company. It is a bit pricey and worth it
4
I love TWG since my first visit, and still do. I just cannot stop visiting them for the impeccable service, luxurious ambience complete with pretty decor, classy tableware and soothing music, and also the delectable food. And of course, the wide variety of good tea.Whether one is enjoying tea sandwiches there, indulging in sweet pastries or having main courses, it is always a pleasure as the quality remains superior. I also love their hot teas served in nice pot jackets, or sometimes the Pink Beauty - watermelon juice with tea.For more details and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/11/twg-tea-company.htm

Been here for brunch with a friend.. i ordered the London breakfast set.. The scones are good, all the cakes were nice, spongy and tasty.. Of course you never doubt about the high quality of the tea.. But what's bother me is the cold & unfriendly waiter and waitress there.. I knew that most singaporean characteristic is less friendly compared to other nationalitiy, but still..... Since this place is include in service sector, dont you think that they should provide and give a nice experience feelings to the guests???
5
TWG might not be for all people. It has silver cutlery and white tablecloths and music ranging from "Tea for Two" to Bach. You can see from the outside that, if you are an Australian or perhaps English, it is what you'd call "posh": it's real "pinkie out" tea-drinking. Having said that, it's the kind of place your mum would love as a venue. It has delicious cakes. There are several hundred varieties of tea and, if you didn't like the tea that you chose, then it was really your fault for not asking whether you could smell it first! That's their suggestion, "sample" the tea by smelling it, because the smell is the taste (and it really is). The staff are good at Ion Orchard: they actually even remember three random Australian travellers who only go there a couple of times a year (not a bad effort). They were very kind and, though we were clad in the typical Australian heat-wave attire of cargoes and t-shirts, we were treated with the same respect and kindness as the people who had come to morning tea wearing pearls and Prada. I recommend this place to people who really love tea. If you don't love tea, then go to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf or Paul's..
4
I stopped in here for a much-needed break after wandering Orchard Road in the mid-day heat. I had never heard of the salon before -- this was my first visit to Singapore -- but this was exactly the pick-me-up I needed. The tea salon is elegant but not fussy. The book explaining all the types of teas, their history, flavour, best brewing techniques, was fascinating. I wish they sold it -- it would make a wonderful souvenir!I had a pot of the white tea and a slice of the pastry of the day -- a crème brulee cake. Both were superb. I ended up chatting with the three ladies sitting at the next table (the label-conscious locals liked my Prada bag). I bought some tea to take home with me as a souvenir. Looking forward to coming back to the salon on my next trip
4
On a Saturday a few weeks ago, we had seen patient customers lined up for lunch at TWG Tea Salon, so we tried to make a reservation for lunch on a Saturday--without success. When we visited for tea and cakes at about 11:30 am on a weekday, we learned that their phone was out of order. The atmosphere is very pleasant, recreating a French cafe without walls in the middle of the second floor of the Ion shopping center. Although there is a wi-fi site, it is for management only, but not for customers. There were only two other customers while we were there, so we were well served by friendly and well dressed wait staff. We enjoyed browsing through the encyclopaedia of tea, but we felt a bit amateurish choosing from the hundreds of varieties of tea. The teas were delicious but expensive, and the pastries were mostly delicious. Of the three pastries that we ordered, we felt that the small cinnamon rolls with whipped cream butter were the most delicious. I would recommend the rolls and the Singapore Surprise, a kind of a creme Brule with berries in it. Although it looked tasty, we were not so impressed with the caramel mousse cake. The service and the setting were memorably attractive, and even romantic because everything was so neat, but it was offset by the First Class prices and lack of wi-fi and phone. Overall, the experience was very good, but we wouldn’t stand in line on a weekend to do it again
4
I ate here with 2 other friends, they have a lovely ambience in the shopping centre.While their food is not cheap, i would recommend you try it at least once. We went around lunch so i ordered a vege quiche which was actually very tasty, better than i expected to be honest.The waitress was nice and gave us plenty of time to decide, and was happy to split the bill and give each person a receipt.Next time i will definitely try their scones and dessert
4
This is the place for tea lovers. There is an extensive menu for tea which comes with a tea encyclopedia. I never knew the benefits and story of each tea and certainly learned quite a bit from my visit. The tea served was very fragrant and simply loved what was served. The service by the waiters were very professional and they are very attentive. One of the best besides those from hotel restaurants.However, if I have one thing to complain, it is the food served. As I was there for dinner, the dinner menu served its purpose but not the dish when served. Portion is a bit tiny and hence it was supplemented with a bun. The bun was without butter and can be quite dry as my dinner was with minimum gravy. Would've totally loved the cod fish dish if not for this blunder
4
I visit this tea salon fot the third in
Singapore this time discovered it
Is listed in tripadvisor
I like thier teas. And always order assam tea
But it is an expensive one
5
After all the walkin' and window shopping took a hiatus for tea. Excellent is the word for this place. You got the choice of tea gastronomy with the fancy teapot and utensil.
5
TWG Tea Salon was a lovely place to share a meal with a great atmosphere, service and delectable food. They have a wide variety of tea to select as well as deserts such as macrons. Their dining menu should not be neglected. I had the nicest piece of herb encrusted salmon which was delicious and full of flavour
5
This brings back the experience of drinking as being something special. Too many teas to even consider in a life time, thankfully the staff are on hand to help you choose. While there, go on treat yourself to a piece of their signature cake, you only live once
5
If you want tea then this is the place to head too.... Amazing tea selection.... Macarons are all tea inspired and only $2 each.... The desserts are to die for as well.... Lovely place to drink , eat, relax, chat and maybe take home some posh teas too...oh and not to mention a fab place to purchase a gift for your tea loving friend
4
My first time in singapore and my first time in TWG tea. I went there alone as a tourist with bunch of shopping bag and no one from the staff had the courtesy to greet me. Service for me is poor. Good thing they had the best foie gras and angus beef burger. Dessert is too sweet for me. I like their signature green tea. This is my last meal in Singapore.
4
When i walked into the store, i didn't plan to buy much, but just enough to sample some nice teas. Carol served me and introduced me to so many teas and my selection just kept growing! Carol was very knowledgeable about the different teas and was able to recommend me quite a selection that i really liked. The only thing that detracted from the experience was that there were small steps at different areas of the shop and people were tripping over them. Other than that, it was a good experience
4
If you are one of those tea lovers who has visited Mariage Freres, Hediard, Le Palais Des Thes then u will not find any difference in terms of packaging, pricing & the ambience. A long menu with quite a few good options for food & snacks. I have tried few varieties of the TWG tea before. (Bangkok TWG tea salon & purchased the tea in outlets in SG airport)At ion orchard salon, we tried scones, macarons, daily special dessert apart from our main dishes the lobster based dish & lasagna. We tried couple of teas - Alexandria & a Okayti Darjeeling tea.The scones were just okay & the macarons are definitely not Laduree. The mint flavoured macaron lacked that subtle elegance that makes a macaron famous. Silverware, well dressed waiters & boutique salon. Typical white linens, silver knives & forks & velvet chairs.Due to crowd, there was a delay in our food getting served but tea was served quick. With 450 teas to choose & trained staff the experience should have been great but it wasn't. Few subtle things were missing - A luxurious but arcane tea pot may not be favoured by all. The 'get up & check for yourselves' daily dessert doesn't augur well somehow. The teas were definitely great though.The mind was enjoying while the heart didn't have compelling reasons to accept that TWG Tea is as great as Mariage Freres or Le Palais Des Thes. The Marco Polo & Earl Grey Imperial of Mariage Freres does touch our hearts. Atleast thats what I felt
5
Love to go here after some hectic shopping in Ion. The service is always excellent and great variety of teas. A little on the expensive side but worth a treat every now and again. Certainly a great place to take visitors for the whole TWG experience. Highly Recommended

I was tired after all day spent in warm Singapore and wanted to relax. I found that shop which looked nice and checked the menu. Afternoon tea with a cake for 19 dollars was a good choice. Several surprises followed. Good surprise was the cake and also the tea, even though I know it is delicious as I know it. Bad surprise... Probably some problem with air condition. Horribly warm and no air. The bill....30 dollars instead of 19 I expected. I was explained that the combination of tea and cake for 19 is served after 3 pm. It was just before 3 pm when I came and 3:17 pm when being billed. The tea, as I said, was delicious. But I expected bigger portion for the price. I saw it was served in tea pots which were quite large. Unfortunatelly it contained around three little cups. Well, overall bad experience. I felt like a bit robbered. Good product does not mean everything. TWG brand is damaged now in my eyes. Pit
4
I loved the salad!!! I really enjoyed it especially when combined with the happy birthday tea.. People are friendly and very accomodating. Will definitely go back
4
Great and cosy place. You can get to know more about all kinds of tea.
It is a perfect place for those tea lovers, reading a novel and hangout.
2
best tea and macaroons to buy, but I was just dissapointed for the service. no smile from the staffs..
4
This is not the best tea room i've been to but one of the best in Singapore. The selection of tea here is outstanding, wide selection, both fruity and traditional, or expansive array of black tea. I got Margaret's Hope, it was light and fragrant. The drink wasn't cheap but i did get a specialty tea so it's worth it. However, they serve quite limited selection of simple baked goods. The girl who took our order was quite unfriendly, however the waiters there were much more gentleman. The place was small and tables are close to each other. The soft lighting and background music greeted us more cheerily than we'd expected
3
went to the cafe upstairs in ION shopping plaza (there are 2 near each other). Boyfriend orfered the scones and pot of tea (Irish breakfast), I ordered just tea with intetion to share the scones. Asked the waiter for assistance in choosing a weak tea (as I am not a tea drinker) he recommended one that was very caramel smelling and tasted not bad... well 1st cup... 2nd was too strong for me to drink so turned out I paid SIN$11 for a single cup of tea... was nice... despite total cost (with 7% GST & 10% service charge, both payable whenever you order food) of SIN$ 35.3
3
Had to try this place once. We were itching for a spot of tea on a weekend and decided on TWG at Ion. The queue wasn't long, but it was slow, as the place was small, and people were you know, slowly sipping their teasWe finally got seated and it was cramped, the tables are so close to each other. For bites, you have a choice of a tea set (cake + tea), something more substantial (scones and such +tea) or just a la carte, like macaroons. And of course, some teas here cost $100 per pot, so you'll have to top up the set price since you're drinking gold. The cakes we had were ok. There are literally more than a hundred choices of teas, and you probably can't go wrong if you have specific favourites or tastesAll in all, an average experience as the ambience was mixed - pretty, but damn crampe
4
Right from when we entered TWG, I was enchanted by the little macaroons in the pastry cabinet and the huge variety of tea everywhere we looked. We popped in for morning tea (I imagine high tea here in the afternoon would have been lovely) and service was quite prompt. As a tea lover, the hardest part was looking through the massive menu (and explanatory book) to choose a tea. We also ordered a bunch of different flavoured macaroons to share and they were all delicious, though my favourite was the passionfruit one. A lovely way to while away an hour and people watch after a busy morning of walking and shopping

Teas are divine in fact we have become addicted to them now ! try the Singapore Breakfast or the Breakfast Earl Grey -- dreamy. The service tends to suck though and they do have the tables so close together that you may experiences dizzyness listen to the very fast chatter of the singaporean ladies who take tea. That said it is an institutional - especially at Takashimaya's. If yo udont want to sit then no need to enter the saloon as you can purchase any tea fromm thier massive stock at the front

The only things that I have tried here are the pastries and I always do takeaway. Having been supporting TWG since its first outlet at Republic Plaza, I am glad to say that the quality of their pastries have remained consistent even after so many years. I am not over-exaggerating when I said that I have tried nearly all their cakes and is recognised as the "girl who always buy cakes". However, I am still trying out new stuff because the selection is always ever-changing.For more details : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/11/twg-tea-salon-boutique-confessions-of.htmlThe patisseries at TWG there rarely disappoint and I would dare say that it is the only place in Singapore that matches those in Paris or Japan. ( I was surprised when I walked past one branch in Jiyugaoka). Why? Simply because the pastries have textuality, technicality, creativity and of course flavours.Most of the pastries at TWG are mousse cakes besides tarts. What impresses me is that the texture of the mousse is always just right while the sponge remains moist (perhaps some have been soaked in liquids). Fruit compotes of different berries ( raspberry/blueberry/cassis) are usually very sour which curbs the creaminess from other components. The tart shell has remained consistently crispy so far. While I can't say that every single piece I've tried is 100% perfect, I appreciate the chef's efforts to keep on inventing, playing with the flavours, textures and presentation. It is hard to spot a classic pastry here (perhaps the millefeuille or the signature chocolate fondant) but it is still possible to find new flavours in their classic pastries.I doubt what I have commented will be readily available since the selection keeps changing. Amazed by the rapid expansion of this Singapore tea brand in Singapore and overseas in such a short period of time, it will be interesting to see what new exciting flavours TWG will offer in future

It was crowded. The air cond isn't working well. It makes waiting for our turn a torture. Good is the mountain of choices for tea. The challenge is choosing the one for the tea you like to enjoy for the moment. If you want to enjoy your afternoon, I would go at a different time. Alternatively, locate another tea house that provides a better environment.

I was surprised when I found out TWG originated from Singapore! This place is lovely. It's like European setting. Lovely place to have a meal or just have tea with someone dear.

Taking an old English past time and turning into a unique local experience. Was great to taste such rich and delicious tea, afternoon tea treats and good service.

An awesome tea selection and service but our breakfast was cold and over priced. Stick wit the tea.

Definitely worth a visit! Over 400 teas available and the desserts were delicious!

Move over the ever so boring coffee houses and you have TWG. Soaked in tradition and the variety of teas on offer are to be seen to be believed

Great tea selection and wonderful macaroons! The passion fruit macaroon was my favorite.

Having seen the TWG Tea only for the last couple of years and I finally decided to give it a try. Went three times with different groups of people. Well, there was a huge selection of tea. You could easily spend one hour going through the list. Tried at least 8 different teas but unfortunately I didn't like any of it except for good old Earl Grey. Fragrant teasâ€“ definitely but even to the point that some flavored tea tasted terribly artificial. Still remember one royal Moroccan mint tea which tasted as if I swallowed perfumed soap. Enjoyed tea infused jelly that came with scones, however. Sandwiches are decent but I was not crazy about their cakes. Service staffs who were predominantly Filipinas/nos were prompt and friendly. Could go back there for service but not for tea and food. Unless my friends and relatives who insist on going to this new S'pore institution, I would not haste to go back there. BTW, if you feel you could not leave Singapore without having tea at TWG, try a salon at the quiet corner of Takashimaya. For better tea, cakes and food, go to Antoinette at the Mandarin Gallery which is just a block away from Ion

The ambience is lovely. You sit in a glass bubble watching people bustling by as you enjoy a pot of the most wonderful tea. I am gradually working my way through their list of 800 + teas. Golden Rose is a must! We had a wonderful meal. I love how everything is infused with the teas. A particular surprise was the prestige cocktail which was infused with Singapore breakfast tea; it was amazing and i wish they sold it by the bottle cause i would certainly have bought a few! The waiters were attentive and friendly I simply can't find anything to complain about. Well, I suppose that there is simply too many teas to choose from and it will take the rest of my life to try them all; but what a life

This place has a great selection of tea and we were lost in the menu. Asked the waiter for help and they are happy to assist. Cannot remember what he recommended but it was truly fragrant when it arrived. We ordered the set which comes with the tea, sandwiches and scones. I had the sandwiches and I really love them, especially the one with foie gras. My wife loves their scones. Pretty neat and tasty food. Good place to have a nice cup of tea and some snacks during the late afternoon, people watching...Price is steep though as we spent about S$40 including taxes. So it worked out to be around S20 per person

After a tiring day walking around the huge shopping mall and visiting the Harry Potter exhibition at the ArtScience Museum, we found this picture-pretty tea lounge (shaped like a huge gondola) in the middle of the shopping mall. We checked out the menu, and found that they were serving all-day dining meals, plus since it was almost 3:00 PM, afternoon tea was also being offered! The food tasted very good - with just the right amount of spices in it. My son ordered a salad with vinaigrette, which he really enjoyed; another son had a burger (he's 11 years old!), which tasted good, too; and I had a chicken dish - excellent! But the best discovery for me was the TWG teas - what took me this long to discover TWG tea? It is the X.O. of all teas - I could actually taste every fruit, herb, flower that went into the perfect blend that they call 1837. I had the 1837 TWG black and green teas - superb! I bought several packs to take back home - which should last me another three months... I made a promise to make TWG tea salon a part of my Singapore visit - every time

Forget the tea, trythe tea infused macaroons. I still remember the amazing purple macaroons! And they are ot as expensive as those in europe, but taste almost as good.
1
ambience is ok. but the tea, isn't of a high quality. it's pure marketing and with the money paid, perhaps we can get better tea elsewhere.
3
Teas were good but S$14 for a pot with only enough for 2 cups was a bit rich. The food was interesting as most include some inclusion of tea flavours which give it an interesting twice that youcan taste and in particular smell.
5
Have the feeling of pampered as well as the menu is VAST (endless to put it bluntly) all sorts of teas from all over the globe

Best tea in town and delectable food and desert . The macaroons in different colors are a delight to the eyes. Next time around have to try their tea ice cream !

My partner is a tea and coffee lover, so I went along with him to the Tea store and cafe to try some myself. We felt very fancy sitting with our pot of flavoured tea and macaroons, and I have to say I did enjoy my chocolate tea.Afterwards we purchased some take home boxes, which although expensive, are very lovely and well made teas.Highly recommended for a relaxing afternoon break after a day of shopping

With some friends, (including one local who knew the places to take us) we went to this shop!I was in awe of the menu! Never before have I seen such a comprehensive selection of teas! We could each have the tea of our choice. I love Assam tea and had several to choose from. The tea is made in a rather interesting fashion, with plenty of panache in the pouring and oxegenating of the tea. It comes in a pot with a warming jacket of brass and needs no milk, nor sugar! The shop is stylish in the decor and for one, such as I, who loves their tea, it is a beutiful shop. The table linen is white and high quality. The staff are freindly and provide a very polite service.If you like a superb cup of tea, then please find this place and let your senses take it all in

The tea unless you are an expert looks the same to me (yes call me ignorant) but I jjust want tea balck tea - this starts at 12$ for quite a small pot. Other food on menu is just silly priced. Not my cup of tea at al

I came based on the recommendation of a friend. It really was quite an experience. The number of different types of teas they offer on the menu is just incredible, and the tea is brewed so perfectly that all the scent and flavor come out fully. Highly recommended for an enjoyable afternoon tea break, but be prepared for a wait
5
They have a wide range of tea menu available, and their tea is by far the best tea that I have tried.  Their desserts also look appeasing, though my friend and I did not have any.  The waiters are very attentive and polite, which is good.  A good place for private meeting or business discussions
