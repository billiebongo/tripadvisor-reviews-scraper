Love the ribs here. And the spam fries. But need to have a bit of patience when you're here as service was a bit alow despite only having a a few customers there.

Tried the one at KL before and I must say the outlet in Singapore is not as good as its neighbor. We ordered the set meal. Food was above average and service was decent. Not worth trying again though.
3
Ribs were good and nicely grilled. Tahu Telor was disappointing as it was just omelette with a few slices of white tofu. Mie Goreng was too soggy for my liking. Iced Bandung was mostly milk and had to request for more rose syrup.
1
Just appalling unenthusiastic service. There seems to be no dress code and no plan of service. How can a bucket of beers take longer to prepare than food!
Terrible slander on a good restaurants name by allowing this outlet to stay open.
4
We had ordered a platter for 2pax, but the serving is good enough for 3pax. Tasty and tender pork ribs, and grilled chicken. The satay and pig ears are yummy too. We will be back for sure :)
1
This place is a joke. The service is the worst I have ever experienced, totally ridiculous. The food was so bad, my “ribs” didn’t even contain ribs! Only slimy, dry meat. They even failed with the beers, placing a bucket with beer on our table and then left. Without opening them or giving us an opener... But that was the smallest failure they did, overall a total disaster with no service whatsoever, they just look the other way when you are trying to make contact

Having good memories eating at Naughty Nuri in Bali, I was excited to learn they have an outlet in Singapore. However I was disappointed - the menu seems quite different than what I remembered we had in Bali, which was more on BBQ and BBQ. Here the signature pork ribs where available, but not much more. Instead it serves a selection of Indonesian (and not so Indonesian) dishes (i.e. localised - e.g. you can't find any 'Bandung' drink in Indonesia, but they serve it here). The ribs while tender and off-the-bone soft tasted quite good but it is missing a tad of the smoky flavor - maybe it was not grilled freshly over charcoal like in Bali. The smashed potatoes were awesome even I don't recall having them in Bali.Price-wise it is on the upper end - so it's ok to fill you pork-ribs cravings, but for the other dishes I think you can get same quality with better price elsewhere. On the positive side the place in Capitol Piazza is quite cozy (the historic Capitol building was renovated very nicely, a nice place to hang out)

They have changed name to Monkey Warung but we found nothing about that online prior to our visit. So when we got to the venue we were confused until we asked the staff. Turns out they changed name. Perhaps franchise license expired? We came here specifically for the ribs and luckily they still had it in their new menu. The ribs were still nice, although maybe not as good as one year ago. Spam fries a tad too salty. But overall food portions were pretty huge and value for money. A full rack is wayyyy more than enough for 2 people. You might want to get half instead and add on some other dishes for variety.Service was okay, the staff were polite but it was sometimes hard to get their attention. Environment was nice and quiet, but there were flies around and kept trying to land on our food. So that was annoying. In the end we ordered a little too much and asked to pack the rest of our food. We were charged 50 cents per takeaway container. Not only is that pretty expensive for some plastic boxes, the cost was included in the bill so essentially we were paying way more than 50 cents per container (+service and gst charges). Kinda ridiculous that they charged it like that. Overall, it’s not too bad a place as the new Monkey Warung but I guess it’s just not the same anymore. Would I come back again? Probably, if I can’t find another place that does ribs like Nuri’s. This might be the next best alternative to satisfy your Bali ribs cravings

My good streak with food joints had to end at some point I guess and it ended with Naighty Nuri’s. We went for the famed Bali ribs; ordered it plus tahu telok, ayah lemak, fried chicken and finished off with gula melaka creme brûlée and goreng pisang.We didn’t get our ayam lemak (even though the service staff checked with us twice), the tahu telor and ribs seemed to share a similar sauce, the creme brûlée was not heated through properly and there was even a charge for taking away the tasteless fried chicken. Disappointing. Unlikely to give this place a second chance. Not anytime soon anyway.

Was there (21st September 2017- Tuesday) with my bf. We had been avoiding this place as we have very less than expected service apart from the good food.We lived nearby so we decided to just drop in for a quick lunch and was hoping things would be better.Upon arrival , restaurant was not that packed and we were seated at an area where we seated facing the kitchen area (eyesore) as can see visibly kitchen crew nibbling on food while preparing your food.We simply love the nasi goreng and the mee goreng as that is what we usually had each time when we were there and we always love it spicy with cili padi served on the side as well.Menu seems to have very limited items ( no Archipelago).it had been marked off in black marker.. What a shame.Upon ordering we were very surprise to know that the kitchen do not have any chilli padi as the server says the kitchen is not able to give us some.A moment later she says the kitchen have it but can't give. I was dumbfolded with her answer. I then call upon her again and ask for some and ask her to charge it accordingly to our bill as being an Indonesian restaurant and I am Indonesian, it is simply a shame (again) to not have cili padi in the restaurant as your cuisine is Indonesian. Surprisingly the lady says No there is no chilli padi in the kitchen at all. By then. We both were like ..ok.. be it ..just served our food. Food was served and both our dishes are sweet ( Not good) despite us asking it to be spicy when we had our order taken.We both just shove down the food down our throat as we are hungry and want to get it over and done.Our lunch was not pleasant at all.Ambience make it even worst.Servers looks like hooligans rather than other eateries where most are warmth, friendly , approachable, knowledgeable and good service etiquette.All looks shabby and looks like they were forced to work.We had decided to forgo this place as nothing seems to change since the service drop down since a year ago. Good luck in your business

If you're a meat lover, Naughty Nuri's sharing platter is perfect. Meat is perfectly cooked and succulent. A wonderful treat for your tastebuds.
4
Excellent food, great ambience. Ideal place for family get-together. Food came quite fast. Ribs were moist and really tasty!
1
It was not crowded but staff gave us a seat in a corner like outcast. Service was not the best and staff was seen wearing tshirt, bermuda and slipper?! Seriously?
4
good bali food with awesome portion. though slightly pricy but nice place to invite friends for a meal!
5
Good food. Good service! Tried different dishes this time round. Love the wagyu burger which was really delicious!
4
We went as a group of 6. We each ordered something from the set lunch menu. I think the more 'local'-style options, like nasi campur and the signature ribs, are good value. We also ordered a full rack of ribs to share. However note that the tables outside can the restaurant can be very sunny (glass ceiling) and the so-called 'lemongrass rice' is really just white rice.
1
with my online reservation I was given a seat outside the TOILET and one big pillar facing in front of me (is like I am having dinner with a pillar).We requested to change seats, they claim that is fully book. When we finish our food not even half the restaurant is filled. Service sucks!!!!
2
2 of their young staff seems like they just woke up & there was a bug at our initial bunk table. It had many legs & it was black, like a caterpillar but it wasn't. We changed tables to a table outside but they didn't seem happy. The signature pork ribs was what we went there for which was still good but the wagyu beef rendang was tasteless, so was the fried rice. Satay was so so. Basically their standards have dropped compared to the other times we've been there.
1
There is a tiny handwritten easy to miss sign at the front saying you have to wait at least 30-40 mins for any food. The staff are awful and clearly not interested in the slightest that you are there. when ribs finally arrived they were cold !!! I had been to HQ in Ubud many times, stay true to the ribs & martinis in Ubud, but avoid this ghastly franchise, Brian would be very disappointed, as was I
3
We enjoyed the platter for two - was a good mix of BBQ ribs, chicken, satay etc. unfortunately some of the dishes were cold which was surprising. The service was slow, and then they seems surprised that we did not tip any extra than the service charge. Would have been so easy to make this a great dining experience- just a little customer service goes a align way.
5
Had dinner with my friend and she loved it. So happy to introduce good food to good friends. She said she will come back!
3
Took a reservation for 5 participants through chope application. We enjoyed the food, especially the pork ribs. Meat was tender and juicy. Whereas, satay and the squid was just a so-so. Orders took so long, and the service need some improvements.
4
Place is good for family and friends gathering.
Food is good for sharing. Overall the food and variety was good and will be back.
4
Food is good service is ok ,price still reasonable but not allow me to use the voucher on public holiday even the term and conditions state able to use on public holiday
5
Goddamn, these ribs just come right off the bone and it makes me go nuts. That's money right there. I just wanna get in there and... RRGH.
3
Nice location. Decent food. But compared to the original in Bali this unfortunately did not stack up.
3
I have not tried the actual one in Bali before. We ordered the 2 pax platter. The taste is not bad. Tasted like stewed pork ribs.
1
This is not our first visit and is vastly different from our previous experience. Service quality has dropped a lot with glum faces and sulky attitudes. Our ribs came with 80% fats which we knew was not the usual standard. The staff told us loftily that these are soft bones and this is the usual standard. We told her we know what is Naughty Nuri's standard and this is unacceptable. They refused to acknowledge our feedback and kept arguing instead. We had lost our appetite by then and requested that the item be removed from our bill. They refused and offered to get the chef out to explain to us. Apparently the chef was also not interested in speaking to customers. The waitress simply stomped to our table, take the ribs without speaking to us and stomped off to the kitchen. The item was removed from our bill but the overall experience was distasteful.To add to the sense of doom in the restaurant, the staff had earlier told us when we first arrived that we have to pay cash without explaining why. We guessed that maybe their machines are down but we can't be sure since the staff are so surly in attitude. We were simply too delighted to find the usually crowded restaurant half empty during lunch on a public holiday to care. On hindsight, perhaps Naughty Nuri's business is indeed down and the reasons are blatantly clear from our recent experience
4
This was a rainy Thursday night. The restaurant is right opposite Capitol Theatre. The place was lively and not too crowded. We enjoyed the food especially the margaritas - very yummy! Unfortunately, there is no happy hour (not that i know if there is any) and though i stated on reservation that it was for a birthday celebration, there was no attempts to make the birthday gal feel special by the restaurant. I asked for extra sauce and it comes with an extra charge. I asked for water and it came with 50 cents price tag though it was free-flow. The bill came up to about $130 for the 3 of us
3
In my opinion, the ribs shouldnt be served without the bones. Parts ot the ribs were tough/dry, it was a far cry from the amazing treat I had in Bali. Granted that this is an overseas franchise, it ought to be even more stringent in upkeeping it's reputation. The side dishes were pretty tasty, and the staff had the decency to phone me prior to my booking to inform me about the credit machines being down. But no, I would not return to dine here again.
3
The rest of the food was pretty average and uninspired but the barbeque pork ribs with Balinese spices and sweet black sauce was well cooked, tasty and delicious. Worth a try.
1
Terrible service. The waitress did not take the order properly. Need to repeat 3 times. Slow to serve the food. Will not come again
4
Excellent ribs! We couldn't get enough. And I don't know what they are called but those fried potatoes on the sharing platter were also delish! Lovely ambience as well with a quiet friendly happy buzz
5
Naughty Nuri's is famous for its ribs and we found out why! The meat platter was solid and the ribs were the best!
2
This was my second visit since they changed the menu I suppose in years, and while the food was ok, the extra costs that they hit you with is truly deceptive. 50 cents for a take away container and SERVICE charge for food items not consumed there and in addition when you want to take away the remaining food you were unable to finish which you consumed there, they charge you again 50 cents for the container. Service was mediocre. I would rather go to Equilibrium and pay more. At the very least there are NO hidden costs. Food was just average. Will I go back maybe not...
3
Went there for a business lunch on a weekday. Staff seem more interested to talk amongst themselves instead of serving the customers. Lunch sets were good and reasonably priced. But management should look into the service crew problem as the young staff clearly needs more training
4
We were walking through Capitol Piazza after Church and wondering where to go for lunch. We wandered through the Gallery and there were a few eating houses, but they were all empty. It was about 12 noon. Naughty Nuri's had a few people and we noticed that many of the tables had "reserved" on them. We thought this was a ploy to make it seem busy, but when we asked if there was a free table for two, it soon became obvious that these were real reservations (about 40 minutes later the place was 75% full). It's not fine dining, but good honest comfort food. They say their ribs are the best in Singapore - I'm not sure about that, but they were good. In fact, we went for the platter and the food was all good and the service was good as well. It all seems to be cooked to order as it took about 30 mins for the food to arrive - no problem, we had snacks while we waited. So it's a good place to try, atmosphere is good (but why were all the other restaurants empty?) and price was on the high sign of reasonable - but still affordable. My last comment - as always, would I go back again? Yes
3
The pork ribs and chicken were not served hot. Corn was charred. Squid and mashed potato were miserably small in portions. All different dishes on the platter only had one same taste, burnt taste (bitter) and the sauce was too sweet. I didn't know what i was eating. Waited for so long for the food. Badly needs improvement.
1
We came here as a group to have a good and quick lunch, it was our first time trying the place. We were a table of 12 and all ordered together. I got the naughty cow (a 200g steak) with the top up (add on a soup of the day, a soft drink and a side).The staff appeared pretty inexperienced, they didn't know their own soup of the day, didn't ask us how we wanted our meat cooked, served my side when I was done with my main course... I eventually told them that I wanted my steak medium rare and got what is in the picture below, a rare steak that tasted as cold as it looks. The fries were cold too, and they tasted bland as they were oily. I have no idea what our soup was, we were told it was a vegetable soup but we were given pieces of fried egg whites, and a decomposed slide of tomato in a hot water bowl. I did not touch it.Another large table which was seated 10 minutes or so after us got their main courses way earlier than we did, which is likely due because our order had been modified due to the waiter's error in noting down what we wanted. We were not served water after we were done with our drinks, not asked if we needed anything else, just food dropped on our table followed by the bill. Pretty tasteless experience for my part
4
Food was great, not a huge portion but certainly worth the buck. Would say the platter was delicious. The ribs was fall of the bone and the potato with pork cracklings was supremely sumptuous. The wings were amazing but felt there was just a bit too much chicken. Perhaps adding some fish or another meat would be nice. Nonetheless, if you're looking for good food, this is the place to go
4
Given a quiet corner for our family gathering which is good. First time trying the 4 pax platter which was tasty.
4
Having been to the original Nuri's in Bali, i was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the food. Had the platter for 2. Ribs were juicy, drop-off-the-bone tender and perfectly grilled. Experience would've been better if it was in an alfresco/beach setting though.
4
Try the succulent ribs which are soft and tender! Price is reasonable and great ambience at capital piazza
1
i've tried their pork ribs in bali (seminyak) and that VERY good ribs, i thought i will get similar experience BUT beyond our expectation we even not sure it was ribs afterall.
3
This is my 3rd visit. The service was more efficient this time (perhaps different crew). Food quality maintained but was quite upset when there were no more red beans for my chendol.
4
We had a nice meal with friends here, the ribs were excellent and so was the smoked eggplant appetizer. We also enjoyed the mee goreng and ayam panggang. Overall, a good meal.
1
the management at this place has clearly given up. since opening did we complain about the horrible service but kept coming back for the food. today topped it all. credit card terminal not working, several food items not available, food menus looked disgusting. this is the last time we patronised nuri in singapore. sad.
3
The ribs were really good. We ordered a 2-pax platter to share with some additional dishes. The clams were average, crispy pig ears were tasty and felt more like keropok. However, the service was slow and the staff seemed rather unfriendly. Perhaps there were too many customers that night hence, the slower service. Would have been better if the restaurant played some ambience music
2
We arrived 5 mins before time, and waited in line for the service crew to finish taking a reservation from the couple in front of us. During this, a lady barged past us, informed the crew that she had a reservation and was immediately seated. I then asked the crew why she was allowed to "cut the queue" when everyone else was patiently waiting. One female service crew did not answer but brought me to my table grudingly. She also took my order and served my food in an unhappy manner.
2
After our order was taken, it took more than 10 minutes for our drinks to be served. There were 4 staffs there but none of them took the initiative to check with me until I asked. Waited 20 minutes for our cheesy fries and then waited another 10 mins for our ribs. Ordered the bottomless soft drinks but I was unable to switch from coke to lemon tea. Wonder why?
1
They have good food but unfortunately paired with terrible and not so friendly service. Don't waste your money here.
3
Food has definitely deteriorated since the last time I visit. The rack was supposedly the star; was a disappointing dish. Definitely won't come again
1
We were dining and could hear the chef shouting at his team. He was not at all embarrassed that the whole restaurant could hear him lash out. Food was super slow and staff were afraid.
3
The standard of the food has dropped. The sambal lala and beef rendang were lacking of taste. Will not return.
4
The ribs were very tasty and to die for. We ordered the platter which has pretty good stuff on it too. Service was average and cleanliness was below average though, there were dirt and dust on our plates. Will go back again to try the other dishes
4
We have always ordered the set for 4. Great taste! The chicken was nice & juicy, surprisingly... but the pork ribs were a bit stringy, not as soft as i would like it. The potato was great too! Love the idea that it is on a chopping board...shared with friends
1
Made a reservation but was ushered to a seat directly at the foot of a staircase! Ordered milo dinosaur only to be thrown a joke that the dinosaur ran away but they have iced milo which made us realise it must be a pre-mix. Eggplant was almost invisible, way too much sauce n onions but not much eggplant at all, tahu goreng was tough like leather, nasi goreng n wagyu rendang was less than mediocre. Sadly disappointing
2
Food tasted terrible. Sambal kangkung was served with very raw belachan and over spicy vegetables. Chendol was served without gula melaka, the waitress didn't even know what gula melaka was when we asked for some. The chendol wasn't just bland, but it was filled with salty beans and corn. Why would red beans be salty?! Overall terrible experience, it's so disappointing because it was far better when I was last here.
3
Service ok. Food quality was acceptable but pricey. Those on gravy tasted almost the same eg ayam pangang, ribs. The satay was very average. Not worth the $18. Overall, over rated food if I read the reviews correctly. You can find Malay food that taste better and at more reasonable prices. But service staff performed well.
4
Load up on your finger-licking rib experience here. It's their signature dish that leaves you wondering what the secret sauce is. The chicken is just as good sans the soft texture and ooey fat of the ribs. Nasi goreng is tasty, visually appetising and a tad spicy. They should serve more ribs in the special platter as they're not quite ticking the value box as of now.
4
Loved the signature ribs which was very tender. However, we have to wait quite a bit for our order as the restaurant was very crowded.
4
The food was nice. The staff are friendly and their service were good. It was not very crowded when we were there at 6 00 pm.
4
Delicious food in Singapore's historical Capitol building. Nice barbecue ribs, squids, egg plant & chicken dishes all good!
4
Best pork ribs ever! The meat was super tender and tasty! Definitely worth trying! The other dishes were average, but the chilli that was served together with the other dishes was super spicy and superb as well!
4
naughty nuri is great, the service was excellent, the location is nicely located near MRT station and bus stops.
4
Good Balinese food. Previous visits were slightly better, as the ribs this time was a bit stringy. Willstill visit again from time to time.
3
Nice and delicious beef Randang and meat is soft and tender... But need to wait a bit long during lunch hour.
2
Ribs were bland, not salty enough, and dry. But the most disappointing aspect was that I went down hoping to try the Friend Nasi lemak as described by Chope's website review
, but it wasn't even on the menu.
4
It's our second visit to Naughty Nuri's and we are still happy with the food served. Our favourite dishes are the barbeque ribs, flying fish, honey marinated chicken and crispy pig ears. This trip is a little disappointing as they do not have stock for two of our favourites: flying fish and crispy pig ears. Nonetheless, we ordered a platter (which comes with bbq ribs, chicken, squid, grilled corns and potato) and tried their egg plant and taohu goreng. They are all excellent! Even the rice taste good too

We have been to the restaurant in Bali. So we when my wife recommended to try today, we came. Really good foods and desserts. Except for slow services, overall is good. Thanks for opening in singapore.
5
Great dining experience, decent food and beverages in this unique restaurant with nice ambience, thanks.
4
Good food and even better service! The ribs are soft, flying fish is well marinated, and the sambal kangkong has a spicy kick!
3
Have been to Nuri's in Bali and its pretty much the same story. Decent ribs but generally fatty cuts. If you don't mind that then crack on, but not more than that for me
3
The foods are generally quite ok but a bit pricy. we order the set for 4, too much meat for us......
3
Nice ambience and attentive and friendly service on a Saturday. The food though was underwhelming. But it is a good spot to plant oneself and company to people watch since it faces the Capitol Theatre. So on nights when events are scheduled, it has great buzz
5
I expected good ribs as Naughty Nuri's was highly recommended. We were not disappointed! Everything on the platter for 2 was delicious. At this type of eatery, I usually do not expect great or interesting desserts. But this place was different - the desserts were great too! Lemongrass jelly and gula melaka creme brulee! Will definitely be back!!
1
I had written a review but I guess it was apparently taken down for whatsoever reason.(well..truth does hurts,is it)We arrived at 1240pm ( 8th March 2017 Wednesday)..order taken 1249pm (as per receipt stated.Food delivered 45mins later (as per my watch stated) wow..!! Guests seated next to us was served 20mins right after their order was taken.Wonder what's the reason??we were there too last Friday and same thing.Seems like the boys mending the shift was not that adequate...We have been your loyal guests since mid last year still we are not expecting a Red carpet service but with servers running around, totally disorganised and disgruntled,always doesn't seem all ready to serve.We have to ask a server ( a short guy in blue tee) to at least serve our entrÃ¨ and that too he reply 'Ok sorry sorry' .I can hear a server talking to 2 female guests he was so stressed running with only 3 staffs today..wow...!!! Such professionalism!Your food is amazing that is the main reason why we always have Nuri's in our dining list but it be really a great help if your team are well equipped with better knowledge and service etiquette as to compliment your Good food
2
It was an atypical day at this place. What would normally be prompt and fast service became quite the opposite today. Apparently, there was a recent cut in manpower. The 3 service staff did their level best to seat us, take orders and serve the food ... and I was trying to be as understanding as I could despite waiting for 45 mins for my set meal to arrive. So, here's the deal. I like the food and willing to give it another go. But if the service doesn't get any better, it will be a pity that it won't be a place I would go to again.
3
Dont know if it was an off day for the service staff, but they either ignored us, or were very attentive at the wrong times. the food was nice, but perhaps not worth the price. Or rather, for the price we paid, okay, it's in the city, but i expected alot more of the service
4
My Friend recommended this restaurant for birthday celebration. We ordered set of two to share but the portion is a bit little. The grilled corns are too dry. Otherwise, the set is good. Service often checked in to refill our drinks.
4
Had the meal for 4 pax. Ribs and drumlets and satay were well grilled. Portion was generous and they even serve local drinks like Milo dinosaur at affordable price.
5
Naughty Nuri's guarantees perfect blend of strategic location, culinary mastery and extraordinary service for diners.
5
Come to this place for its mouth watering melt in your mouth pork ribs. Very very yummy! Recommend that you order the set lunch with beef or chicken, and order a slab of ribs to share around.
4
The staffs are friendly and willing to fulfil our request to change seats:)the food is not bad too.thanks.
4
Their juicy ribs are the most awesome in town with the sauce making them better than the dry and tougher Western barbecue ribs. Other Indonesian dishes are equally good.
3
Ordered a platter for 2. 1 chicken thigh + half slab of (short) ribs not enough to feed 2 pax. Taste was not bad, food were only slightly warm when arrived. The sides were pathetic. Sotong was hard, cold & scrawny. Not even the size of a hotdog! Achar was barely a table spoon size. The best thing had to be potato though only about 8 pcs of half a nugget size. Staff was less than enthusiastic. Almost literally dragging her feet to attend to us.Not impressed
4
We ate at NNs in Bali just a few months ago so were keen to try Singapore's version.In short, we thought:1. The ribs are even better in Singapore... super tender (don't try passing one across the table or the meat will just fall off the bone!).A word of caution though - don't get carried away in ordering (or eating) the ribs. Together with the sauce they sit heavily in the tummy afterwards! (You could easily share a full-slab of ribs between 3 or 4 people) 2. The draught beer (3 choices - including Tiger and Guinness) goes really well with the ribs!3. The chili sauce in a bottle on the table is great (its hot and tasty). You can have it with the ribs, the satay, the rendang, the nasi goreng... well, anything on the menu!4. The air-conditioned and interesting Capitol Piazza is a different experience than the rustic shack in Ubud, Bali. If you have a large group just beware that the "outdoor" section has a sloping floor and sitting at the restaurant end of the long table you are constantly looking up the table at your fellow diners
3
Overall it was an average experience for a birthday celebration. Service was slightly slow which could be due to the fact that we were on the second floor. Food wise, it was really within expectation as I have tried them earlier last year during my visit to Bali.
5
I loved the ribs with that sweet black sauce. The crispy flying fish is also a must try. It is the kfc of fish!The indonesian flavor is amazing and i recommend any tourist travelling to singapore to give this place a try.Must order dishRibsFlying fishLemak chickenIndo mee gorengKang kong sambalService: very friendlyVibe: nice building and lots of erdinger

Never been to the one in Bali, heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try.
This platter was shared by 4 persons
👍🏼 ribs- tender and juicy
Will be back

My boss brought me to naughty nuris to try their Bali Ribs.The ribs were so delicious. Tender, drooling, tasty, sweet, awesomely heavenly good.Their kang kong is so nice. We ordered the fried flying fish, the chicken legs, squid, almost everything in the menu.I hope the restaurant can serve BALInese steak and Balinese bak kut teh.So delicious that I am bringing my mummy and family here pretty soon.BEST DISH: RIBSBEST DRINK: NURIS MARTINIBEST DESSERT: CENDOLSERVICE: 5/5FOOD: 5/

Visited the Singapore outpost of this famous Bali institution to pay homage to the humongous Babi Rock Anthem platter. NN's Indonesian style ribs marination with a bewitching / mind blowing spicy/savory mix soundly defeats the one dimensional all American versions from likes of Tony Roma's, etc. The juicy meat falls off the bones and melts in ones mouth.Top the ribs with succulent pangang prawns and more kickass wings, we had our own gastronomy battle to fight to wrap up the HUGE serving. After a long but satisfying struggle, we had to admit defeat and foggy bagged the leftovers - which actually tastes even better the next day with their tongue numbing sambal paste. NN is definitely a not to be missed ribs institution with a cosy laid back ambience and friendly service staff too

I have not tried Naughty Nuri's in Bali hence I could not really compare the food experience. I can only judge on my own personal preference. Overall I think the pork ribs is above average, saving grace is the kechap manis chilli sauce. However, I will return for their Indonesian dishes. Anyway apart from the food, the staff and manager need to be more polished

Didn't plan on anything fancy for C'mas Lunch and since it was already 2.30pm, we thought we'd have lunch first before checking out the many shops in Capitol Piazza, as it was our first visit there. We decided on Naughty Nuri's as the place was quite packed and brightly lit by skylight, giving it a cheerful atmosphere! Ordered the Christmas Set which comprises 1 full rack of Signature St Louis Ribs + 1 serving of crispy pig ears + 2 bottles of Bintang beer...cos the photo looked so appetising!!Alas, we were not disappointed as the rubs were juicy and absolutely tasty; the crispy pig ears were a tad salty but went well with the beer; I also had a Mocktail-Strawberry & Lychee Punch.Considering the ambience, service and quality of food, the set meal is really value for money! Definitely worth a repeat visi

Personally I think the ribs here in the Sg branch is better than the one in Ubud, Bali. But of course the price would be much more here. The eggplant and crispy pigs ear (covered with curry powder) were delicious. Overall the food was good. Despite being in an airconditioned restaurant, I didn't quite like sitting under the sun roof at Capitol Piazza though becoz the noon sun was quite warm and glaring, dinner would be cooler. The only thing that sucked was the service by a particular waitress who seemed like she didn't wish to work

I've heard quite a bit about how nice their Ribs is and how famous and popular they are in Bali. But its quite a dissappointment. Firstly the price on the menu is pricey though it looks very well presented and the portion seems good. But the dissappointment came when we ordered a mixed platter for 2 pax, the serving was quite small and I its barely enough for 2 pax. I would give credit to the Ribs as its quite yummy. But for the price and also the service at this outlet in Capitol Piazza ... I wouldnt return for a 2nd time. Its not worth paying and they have restricted dining time depending on the number of pax you have called to make reservation

We ordered the "Babi rock anthem" set to share among the 5 of us. The portions are generous. The carmelised sauce coating the pork ribs, buffalo drumlets and ayam panggang are similar in taste (too sweet to my liking) & Colour, as such, it was difficult to tell them apart. The pork ribs were well marinated, tender and juicy. The restaurant limit our dining to 2 hours, as such, we had no time to try the desserts.
4
You can't fault the ribs here or the service but the Singapore branch lacks the charm of their Bali headquarters. The ribs were delicious as were the desserts but the fries were not as good as Batu Belig and they don't have sweet potato fries on the menu. There's no warmth in the service and of course no "shake shake" dance when they serve you your martinis. Instead you get served your ribs in a sterile air conditioned atmosphere which takes half the fun out of dining at Naughty Nuri's

4-stars food + 2-stars service/atmosphere = 3-stars rating If anyone has been to the original Naughty Nuri's in Bali, one would immediately be underwhelmed by the flat ambience of this outpost in Singapore. Naughty Nuris' = fun, bustling atmosphere... not in a quiet, serene place like Capitol Piazza. Given its location, then the staff should try their best to give the diners some sassy, proactive, interested service. Not the disinterested, sometimes abrupt attention we got. We smiled and were nice when placing orders and asking for things, and these niceties were not always reciprocated. Fail.Our party of 4 was not impressed with the service by the guy at reception - we asked to see their menu to decide if we wanted to eat there, and after some minutes of discussion, we decided to, only for him to tell us they're fully booked (but we can wait for a table).... like what sort of nonsensical service is this?! If you have no tables, tell us when you pass us the menus to look at, not after we have decided!! Fail. Now, to the food. They were good. We had their 2 person platter-set, and added another side of corn, and their crispy pig-ears. Their famous pork ribs were amazing - the super-tasty meat falls off the bone; the chicken-chop-esque thing was flavourful and juicy; grilled squid was nicely done. All sambals and sauces were very good. That bowl of crispy pig ears (sliced thinly and fried in a beautiful batter) was more-ish, and would certainly go very well with beers! The lychee martini my friend had was quite nicely-done too. I suppose I can say: recommended (for the lovely food) ...just a shame about the service and atmosphere..
3
Service was not prompt here except for a lady who was more attentive to our orders. Food wise, not bad and appropriate portion but selections here are limited. Noticed that people are coming here for their pork ribs.
5
Had an amazing dining experience with a couple of my friends, would definitely recommend the ribs. Big ups to the chef!

The name makes you curious. Who doesn't like something that's naughty and nice ;) I ordered the set meal for the day with Wagyu rendang and my friend had the burger. Both dishes didn't disappoint. The beef was tender and juicy and serving size just nice. I topped up my set meal with the pulut hitam which was served in a cocktail glass, a nice twist to the old but goodie dessert. The next I go, I think I will try the group meal - the meat variety in that dish looks really yummy. Be sure to make reservations to get good seats.The other plus is that it's located in the iconic Capitol Theatre.
4
Shared a platter including the famous pork ribs and other dishes such as the chicken and burnt squid, which were all flavourful and well cooked. It is a great place for some food and cocktail before theatre, the ribs is tasty and the cocktails such as the martini and the tropical mojito are really nice starters to enjoy the food. Definitely a return place for us if we are in the area
5
Conveniently centralized location for straight up service and amazing ribs. Charming ambience with loft seating, the sharing platters are fabulous as the assortment of sides compliments each other whilst enhancing the wholesomeness of the rack of ribs. But of course the ribs are perfect on their own should one choose to feast on nothing else but ribs and ribs alone, for the texture, aroma and flavour are simply a combination of a masterpiece. Reservations are highly recommended though, as it can be a challenge to get seats for walk-ins during lunch / dinner rush hours

My favorite ribs are usually bak kut teh and bak chor mee. Now with naughty nuris awesome ribs,i have found a new pork that is so juicy, tasty, delicious. The service is great with a fun and chic environment. Will be here very often since it is next to my work place

Bali is one place famous for -among others- its food. I've heard and read about Naughty Nuri's but never had an opportunity to try it - only to find out they set up in Singapore.Whilst they're famous for babi guling (suckling pig), I'd also recommend the sticky grilled prawn. Three large whole prawns, charred black, succulent, and sweet. The two-person 'Babi Dua' platter is good enough for three, including pork two ways, grilled squid, 'begedel' (mashed potato croquettes), and a pickle to clean the palate. Nice

We had a late dinner at the restaurant tonight for the first time. At past 9pm on a Monday night, it was still relatively well occupied with patrons. Right off, service was only so-so. We walked straight into the restaurant and looked for seats on our own as there was no staff at the entrance. Finally a staff directed us to a table, which had been recently cleared after another patron. There were bits of meat all over the table, so the staff did not clean the table properly, and we had to ask for serviettes, plates and water as those were not forthcoming.We ordered the half rack of ribs, the soup buntut and the prawn panggang. We had been to the original outlet in Ubud Bali and therefore could compare the food. The marinade sauce clearly differed from the original, it was not slathered on as generously as in the Ubud outlet but the prawn and the ribs were still well done with a smoky flavour and the ribs were tender and falling off the bone. The prawn was accompanied by pickled vegetables which had a good zing and was very refreshing. The soup was also not salty and generous with 2 oxtail portions and vegetables. We would highly recommend these dishes.The lychee martini needs much improvement, it was sweet and that's it. Absolutely no "kick" to it. Also the warm water was served with plastic cups, which came across as rather tacky.Atmosphere wise, it's nothing like the original. If you are one for atmosphere, this is not for you. It's on the ground floor of a shopping mall, facing a huge screen showing nonstop advertisements. Location wise, it's conveniently located across the road from the MRT station and with bus stops in all directions.We will definitely be back to try the other dishes

it must have seemed like such a good idea to transplant bali's best rib joint to SG. but apparently some things don't travel. this place has zero atmosphere - the odd, multilevel location in the 'new luxe' capitol piazza doesn't work, the bar is a joke, and as far as we could tell most tables have a view of ... the mall, that's all. our food tasted ok but was not served hot. big bummer. a pale imitation of the ubud original. can't recommend
1
Absolute rip off! Went there for lunch and ordered a chicken salad - recipe says shredded chicken salad and when the salad arrived I had to hunt for the pieces with a magnifying lens. Asked the waitress in case they had mixed up the orders - she offered to get a new portion quickly or perhaps add the chicken on the side. She took my order back to the Chef and he says no it is meant to be a little sorry! My colleague ordered Ayam Lemak and th chicken wasn't fully cooked on the inside. Wouldn't go there again

If you're craving for those tender, juicy, charred ribs from Bali
I'm disappointed everything tasted so different - from the sauce on the ribs to the chili
Nevertheless, if you discount the fact that you're at 'Naughty Nuri's' the food is decent
3
We tried the ribs and the squid bakar. Squid was tasty and had a refreshing taste. We found the ribs juicy, tender and the marinade was good. Topping it off with lime was a nice added flavor. Service was so so and it felt as they were on auto pilot. A few times we had to prompt the staff if we needed refills or another look at the menu. One waiter was still eating when he served us some drinks......Location is nice to visit as it is all refurbished and it is very upscale

The ribs here are as good as supermarket ribs. There's nothing special about the flavour or the presentation. It's located in a posh but silent mall. By silent I mean that half the tenants aren't open and there are hardly any shoppers around. Service crew seem tired and lackadaisical. We ordered a full rack of ribs, it was not cheap, but we decided to leave it. Save the calories and proceed elsewhere. Tons of other great restaurants in Singapore. This Balinese franchise does not live up to the hype.
3
Menu has been localised for Singaporean customers with items not found in the original NN in Seminyak, Bali.However the worst thing is the ribs, although good by most measures, is nowhere near the awesomeness of the original in Bali. This is a let down when considering the price and is a poor representation of NN especially for customers who have not had the chance to try the original.Hope the restaurant can improve the authenticity of its star dish and the menu in general
4
The lunch special indicated during our visit were the burger and ribs, but only the ribs was available. Having heard about the ribs, we decided to give it a try. Service was quick and the food arrived in no time. The ribs was excellent, and the meat came off the bone nicely and was very tender. However, the serving for the lunch special was a little small.
3
Came for a quick dinner. Was seated within minutes but was seated at a corner which was near to the toilets. Order a Dua platter. Ribs was tender but a touch too sweet to my liking, while the chicken lack the crispness, potato was nice and season with cumin (I Guess).

We had eaten at Naughty Nuri's in Bali. So, we decided to try the new outlet in Singapore.It was more upmarket compared to the unpretentious smokehouse in Bali. But the food was a pleasant surprise!The ribs was "fall off the bone" tender, and the ayam bakar was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. We had a platter for 4 to 6 persons. 4 of us practically polished off the platter.It was a good dinner, and not too expensive.Highly recommende
4
We arrives at 11:30am after hearing about its popularity and lunch queues. There is no queue. Maybe the hype is over and people have moved on to the next latest fad. We had the lunch specials. The food tastes good. The service is good. But we find the serving too small. We get about 1/4 rack of ribs with chips and sides. We have find a second lunch to fill our stomach

I had Naughty Nuri in Bali and loved it. When I heard that one had opened in Singapore I was eager to try it out. The location of the place is great and the staff is friendly. We had a half rack of pork ribs, cheese fries, skewers, and two drinks (Australian root beer and mango juice.) It is quite similar to what we had in Bali but the portion is smaller, however the environment was brighter and cooler (compared with Bali's hot weather without aircon!) The final bill was $70+ which is at least double what we paid in Bali, but this is Singapore. Our normal dining range is $40-60 so this might be for a special occasion and/or when we feel the need for something fancier

Truth is, I have never heard of Naughty Nuri's until the time we started visited The Capitol to dine at Angelina and very recently, Kaiserhaus. So when one of our colleagues asked us if we'd be interested to check out Nuri's for lunch, to try out their famous ribs, I immediately said yes! It was lunchtime on a Friday, but we got there quite early so we didn't have a problem getting a table. However, when it came to ordering, we realised we weren't that hungry and thought that the rack might be a little too expensive for lunch, so we ordered individually. The seafood fried rice sounded delicious to me and by golly, it was! We also ordered burnt squid with this delicious orange-coloured sauce I don't know the name of. My seafood fried rice was black which suggests that it may have been mixed with some squid ink (which I love!) and had two big prawns on top. We have no complaints about the service because the staff who attended to us was generally nice and fast. My colleague had mee goreng which came in a full set with satay, fried egg and crackers. All in all, I thought it was a lovely lunch experience and I wouldn't mind going back again - this time to try the ribs.:
4
The food is about 75percent standard of the Bali's. Wonder if it's the type of pork used. Notheless, the place has a good ambience for gatherings. The setting is unlike Bali's,properly they took over from an previous owner( who run a Japanese Restaurant)
3
Went with family who had loved the Bali branch so much. A little disappointed it wasn't as good and also that our ribs weren't very hot in terms of temperature. Could have been marinated longer too. Wouldn't go back.
4
The ribs are good but I prefer the branch in Ubud. we had the pork ribs and the beef rendang both were good. The location in Capitol is nice and conveniently located
3
To start off, it has a great location in Singapore, in the new Capitol mall where it is housed next to restaurants and bars. It was easy to locate and we made reservations upfront in case it gets too packed. The BBQ food is decent but there isn't any WOW factor to it and it didn't helped that we arrived at happy hour time and there wasn't any as they ran out of a particular 'happy hour beer' Typically one would imagine it can be replaced by another house beer or offer but nothing was done. It was just very poorly handled and the poor waiter got a good teasing from us but we know it is not his fault. The only dish that stood out is the steamed fish, apart from that - everything else is pretty normal and some dishes are overly spicy. My other mates who visited the Bali outlet felt it was very average here in Singapore

Ordered the full rack and the meat is so soft, it practically slice off easily from the bone with no effort needed in cutting! The soft bone in it is also so chewy Other must try... Burnt corn, corn fritters and pig ears! The chef is so compromising to serve the spice separately as my kids cannot take spicy... It still taste as good though... One suggestion is to dip the pig ear with the yogurt sauce that is served with the corn fritters... A different kind of yum yum Will definitely be back!

I made reservations in advance coz I know that they are usually packed on a Friday night however when we got there they told us that we had no reservations under my name.. That was a bit upsetting coz we travelled from the east just to eat there.. Then the lady said she could accommodate us if we return the table back in an hour.. This is a very strange system they have going there .. People go out on a Friday night to eat and relax and not to watch the clock !!! The food is just average and very expensive the portions are so small .. Nothing like the one in Bali .. Anyway would not recommend and will not visit again

Had lunch at NN after hearing quite a lot about how good it is. The food did not disappoint. I had the pulled pork burger, but the other dishes that I saw on tables around me looked very delectable and I would try. However, I had to lower the overall score as the service was very iffy. I hope NN can buck up with training their staff as it would be a pity otherwise. On arrival for lunch, without a reservation, one of the servers seemed to take my request for a table. Little did I know that only the hostess would do this. The said server didn't bother to link me up to the hostess. He just noted it was table for 1 and then walked away without doing anything. Meanwhile a group behind me properly approached the hostess who started to try to seat them - I had to tell her I was ahead of this group (also without reservations) to get myself a table. After ordering (and it wasn't that crowded at this point), it took literally half an hour for my burger to arrive. This was after a number of chasers with various servers. I noted that many of the servers (including the guy who "didn't seat me") rush around the restaurant in apparent business... only to "rush" to stand together and chat on the periphery of the restaurant. For people eating, these servers didn't bother to at least follow up (if nothing else, for politeness sake) on how the food was, anything more, etc. Then, for bill payment, I had to wait for the manager to come to the cash till to take my payment. Seems no one else could do payment. Really hope NN bucks up on service as their food is really quite enjoyable and it would be a pleasure to repeatedly visit to eat, provided the service is brought up to standard

I had the most delicious barbecue ribs in Naughty Nuri's in Bali. It was so good that I went back there 3 more times for the ribs.When Naughty Nuri's opened up a branch in Singapore. Well, I finally had a chance to try out the ribs again.I wasn't disappointed!The ribs are barbecued to excellence! The meat soft and tender that falls off the bones, which the special barbecue marinate of Asian spices and what I think was the sweet sauce of Indonesian ketchup manis was again a great combination of taste and flavors.I admit I have a thing for barbecued ribs and I only order that only.The restaurant also offers a variety of Indonesian and local Asian food
3
The clean set-up is kind of discordant with a BBQ eatery (unlike the rustic hut at the original in Ubud). Some side dishes/appetizers are yummy, like the crispy pig ears. The ribs are good, but not something to travel far for - somehow too soft and a bit too sweet. Exercise a lot after a meal here

One of the most anticipated openings this year in Singapore, Naughty Nuri crashed and burned right out of the gate.Naughty Nuri’s signature ribs were a whole of impressive-looking but dull tasting, not-even-warm and indistinct ribs. For me, pork ribs should have an exterior that’s caramelised and a little firm, giving way to a smoky, tender and moderately moist interior. The indistinguishable ribs served here should have been saved for someone’s pet dog. Pigs needn’t die for this dish. The saving grace is that the subtly spiced beef rending – slowed cooked short ribs in coconut milk – is really delightful.The falling-apart-tender meat and the thick, rich sauce was a heady combination.Naughty Nuri’s calling card is, after all, the half rack and full rack sticky ribs. I don’t care for that and neither should you. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
