The Rotisserie is a good casual café-style place for breakfast (good as it's not so crowded) and lunch (when it can be very busy). Sandwiches, egg dishes and other things are all pretty good. Coffee is not bad too!

Good value food in the CBD, nice relaxed environment with aircon or outside seating, polite wait staff, a good place to go for the CBD working crowd.

I usually only order one item. The chicken roll with chips and with extra gravy. That's my favourite and I have tried some of the other items (meat pies etc ) but that's the one for me

Too many places to choose from in downtown Singapore. Stopped at the rotisserie,ate inside,90° outside. Air conditioning, free cold strawberry water.it was excellent. We had the chicken Panini. I had a beer ,pure Blonde, and my wife had lemonade. 30 Singapore dollars. Could have eaten cheaper but the food was too good

I was brought to this place for lunch. The hi-light seemed to be the chicken. However after seeing the portion (it was very big!), I had ordered the black Angus beef burger set. Although the salad variety was not much, the selection was tasty. Likewise for the burger. The portion was big too and I would say the price was affordable. Other than being prompt, I would suggest the service crew to be smile. None of them smiled, and they were not even chatting among themselves. They looked so serious or even unhappy to be there.

I was in The Rotisserie with some clients upon a recommendation. The food was quite nice, provides a slightly different but delicious taste of smashed potatoes, oh yeah: and good quarter chicken. They have a interesting system of putting together the meals, giving you a good choice.Service was quick and friendly

Dinner at $12.50 w 20 % off if you are a DBS card holder. My chicken quarter was cold as this is past 8 pm ! the serve of coleslaw n potato salad was generous but bland ! In my humble opinion you get better roast chicken at Cold Storage when it comes out of the oven for sale ! The chicken meat was moist (not dry but could do with asian flavours like black pepper or honey chicken. the This is my 3rd visit in 3 years and perhaps i might change my mind if i had chicken out of the roaster. Meanwhile I will get my chicken fix at Tian Tian (hainamese boiled chicken ) or Peri Peri (portuguese spicy roast chicken) !

It was my 1st time dining at The Rotisserie and I didn't imagine the food turned out to be so tasty & fresh. I loved what I ordered today for a set meal consists of Soup, Salad & Panini. My spouse ordered a Roasted Chicken Pasta which tasted really good too. He also ordered a cup of Illy's cappuccino which was freshly brewed. We had coleslaw, cold chicken pasta as well. The food served was really fresh because you could taste the freshness of the veggies from the coleslaw. And do note the portion is quite huge for my set meal. Will be back again for sure. Highly recommended for their food and their excellent staff service too!!

I went for a latenight snack and as a loving Chickenfan i was not dissapointed.Ordering a Chickenroll, i didnt know that meant Minced chicken in a Cut white Bread, expected something else. The Chicken was Flavoury and zesty but the bread not so much. It came with an undistinguishable fade sauce and two side dishes of my own choice (Singapore Noodle Salad & Coleslaw) which were both quite good!Its a self service system, free water fillups and cozy seats! Good place for a casual visit

First time visiting hence not familiar with their ordering system. The staff at the hot side dish counter gave me a sarcastic look when I told her I wanted cold salad. Little did I realise she was asking me if I wanted gravy for the chicken .Not very helpful. Ordered hot chocolate and was given a lip stick stained cup which I requested her to change. We asked a waitress to help us take a group photo. She said she was busy clearing tables and will help us when she was done. She never cane back.

A great lunch time option

It brings back the memory 2 years ago when I worked nearby. My everyday lunch place. Went back again after 2 years and it has gotten way better. Love the roasted chicken and salad.
Recommended lunch place for tourist but it can be very crowded.

The cleanest, freshest, most delicious food. Healthy and in no way plain. Just what you need to keep cool in hot, humid, sticky, spicy Singapore.
The best grown up chips (french fries) in the world!

Lunched at Rotisserie the other day. Their grilled chicken panini is excellent, and I liked their coleslaw which they make with purple cabbage. Pasta salad was quite dry, and lacked flavour / taste but overall had a nice meal @ reasonably pricing

Good for lunch. The chicken was tender and juicy and it comes with 2 salad sides. Definitely a satisfying lunch!

We were at Telok Ayer Street and needed a quick beer, after the business day.Popped into this restaurant which was serving bottled beer. They had Asahi which we got. If you buy in larger quantity, you get a better price per bottle.Most importantly, it was air conditioned, which allowed us to escape from the heat outside.Great for a quick beer pit stop

I have observed that the chicken at this place is the most selling item. Hence, many times i passed by this place and never even bothered to check their veg offerings (since I am a vegetarian). A business associate took me to this place for the first time and I was surprised to eat the super vege panini. Very well toasted with just the right amount of veges in it. Perfect for a workign day lunch. Service is a bit slow and needs improvement. The place is always full so its difficult to grab a place

As an aussie who has lived away from home and leaving Singapore just as the Rotisserie chain started to open up in Singapore - this is my go to place to remind me of the char-grilled chicken back in Australia.Agree the the question about value in terms of price - but I assume it is a Singapore thing as it can be quite busy at times which means people are OK with it.Telok Ayer street location seems to be clean and have decent service. I notice they always remember my boss when he calls in for coffee during the day.I definitely only come for the roast chicken...I think the vegies and salads have their moments...and I can overlook everything else as it is just the chicken for me

We were looking for brunch places and this came up as a search results so we decided to give it a try. It's located right behind Prudential Towers and we missed it at first but turned back across the street when we saw the sign. It's neat and tidy a place in terms of decor. There was only 1 family when we entered. Both of us had the Aussie breakfast with different sides. I had the sunny side-up, sauage, mushroom and tomatoes. My partner had the omelette, sauage, bacon and hash brown. When food was served, it feels a bit overdone with all the charred edges and the egg looking very burnt at one end. The sauage was quite salty. The tomato is good though. The omelette is huge. The mushroom soggy and salty. Not the ideal kind of brunch to wake up for. Down the street we saw Intrepid having brunch offers too. Will probably not come around again. In terms of pricing not cheap too. We spent almost $40 for the two sets. Drinks are additionally charged
