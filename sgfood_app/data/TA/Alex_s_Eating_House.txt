Everything roast meat lover 'must try'. The serving is generous. The price is affordable. They make their own meats and the soups are delectable additions.
Do not ever walk past Beach Rd and not try it!

I went there for lunch and ordered a BBQ pork rice. The meat came with many small pieces. I feel the price is 20% more than average.

Great food at a good price I would recomend the meat combination. Open early and for lunch but they dont stay open late

This place is forever packed during lunch. Still like to come for I find is value For Money and their soup is tasty. Sad though they have increased the price slightly.

Alex's Eating House is located a block away from the MRT Station. Compared to hawker centres, Alex's has the best pork rice that I have ever tasted. It is very cheap, and the meals come with pickled vegetables. Very tasty and very cost effective lunch place (they are closed for dinner) Will surely come back for more. As this is an open place, do not come here if you are looking for an air conditioned restaurant. The place gets crowded and seats may be hard to find since they are always flocked by customers.

To avoid queuing at this shop, better to show up at 11:30 and u have your pick of the seats, which will be filled up fast after 12. The BBQ duck, chicken and pork is succulent. The soup (watercress, lotus roots etc) compliments the otherwise heavy meal very well.

This is one of our favourite food haunt to enjoy a special king of noodles that is served with chicken or juicy roasted pork. Don't forget to order a bowl of soup, which we like the wanton version best; the dumplings are big and meaty! Highly recommended

The soup was delicious, the duck well roasted, the service kind.........the price very low! Only the terrace is next to a bus stop, so you might get some fumes from the road. But for a good and quick meal is great and mouth watering....

Excellent BBQ pork especially the char siu. Skip the bbq chicken as it's pretty average. No AC so you will sweat a little bit.

This place serves a good char Siew and roast duck. Good balance of meat and fats. The charring is well balanced. Been consistent after so many years. Food is served quickly without much fanfare. Great place for a quick lunch.

I've eaten here - sit in and take-away. Such good value for money and your tastebuds will be forever grateful if you take them here.

@TheKuoKnowsDon't expect buttons and bows at Alex's Eating House. But do expect bangs for your duck.The low-key eaterie specialises in Cantonese Roast Duck. And it does it very well. The queues of office staff at lunchtime speak volumes for the quality of its Hong Kong-style meats.While its roasts are top-notch, the service does leave a little something to be desired. But with duck tasting this good, who cares if the staff can be a little grumpy at times.Try to look beyond the roast duck, though that can be a little hard to do. Give the roast chickens and roast pork a try - they are a definite hit, too.The stir fry Kai Lan is done to perfection. That said, I have never quite figured out why a plate of vegetables almost anywhere in Singapore can cost more than a plate of meat. It's not just a criticism of Alex's but a general observation of restaurants in Singapore. They charge far too much for greens. It makes trying to eat healthily a little financially challenging

I've been curious to try this place for some times as it always seems to be very popular, and particularly so at lunchtimes. We opted for a selection of duck and pork. The pork was pretty good but I actually wasn't that impressed by the duck. Overall I'd say it was ok but certainly not fantastic

All menus at Alex Eating House consist of duck - I suppose this is because duck is their specialty. The place is not very clean - and I am a little put of with the level of hygiene. The lady serving the food is always on a rush and impolite. Food presentation is less than presentable - at least to my standard. I wouldn't recommend this place.

Alex's is located on Beach Road, nearest Mrt station is Bugis. It's casual dining, non air-conditioned. Only opens for lunch. On a weekday, it's always crowded at lunchtime and could be difficult to get a seat. Weekends are better if you want to avoid the crowds. Everything on the menu is good but the real draw is the roast meats. Must try the charsiu, roast pork and roast duck. And try the double boiled soups too. The quality of the food here can rival some of the popular roast meet joints in Hong Kong, and certainly one of the best in Singapore. Prices are very reasonable

as soon as we arrived in the hotel THE PARK VIEW HOTEL, this restaurant is near and you can smell the tempting odor of the foods. and you can see a lot of people are eating outside the restaurant. we ordered their best selling peking duck. and the best ever i tasted so nice and tender. you have also some option you can have their crispy pork and wanton soup. the their prices is minimal and affordable.
