Went to Raj for dinner. Once again, food and service did not disappoint. We ordered:Dahi Gol Gappa(Dahi Puri)Good. It has 6 puris and was served quickly. Onion UthappamJust the typical thing and simply delicious Sambhar VadaInteresting this time. It was served piping hot and with Vegetables Butter RotiJust the regular thing Kadai AlooTad too spicy. Itâ€™s Aloo with capsicum but still delicious Chole Bhature Not very crispy but still great. Channa was not spicy and that was good JilebiI didnâ€™t have this because my Brother finished the whole thingRasgullaGood and sweet Service was great and the staff are very nice and friendly. Will definitely visit again

Raj Restaurant (Race Course Road) Located at #01-01/05 SoHo @ Farrer, 172 race course road. Very bland ambience, and the place is very STALE. The menu is primarily vegetarian with a lot of paneer options available, the vegan options were a little limited we thought. The food that we ordered, such as the masala Dosai, vegetable makhanwalla with jeera rice and chapatti, just lacked the complexity of spices and taste we were expecting. For the staff ,service is inactive, I found them to be very rude no idea how to cater for people. (We felt invulnerable throughout). To sum up in few words, my dining experience ranks one of the worst dining experience in Singapore. Honestly to me, Hawker Centre food tastes much better. Very Very disappointed

Often visit this restaurants as it's one of our favourites... Yes food is too good.A pure vegetarian restaurant and also caters to Jain and Vegan preferences.Unfortunately... Yesterday 31/Dec/17 was there last day at this location.... Will be operating from their another existing restaurant at Race course road. Will be missing this outlet as it was very close to mustafa... Very convenient.Ambience is simple and average... Can be improved a lot.But food and service is good.Had relished the varieties umpteen times, and always enjoyed it.A must try for food lovers..

Visited this place sometime in October 2017. I asked for a masala dosai to be made without any oil and the waiter checked and returned with the suggestion that the dosai could be made without oil but the vegetable stuffing had oil in it and in any case, it wasnt much. Wife and I enjoyed the food. Staff were attentive and accommodating and all in all, it was an enjoyable experience. Ambience used to be a lot better when the restaurant first started operations but it has been quite a number of years it has been in business and it seems that not much attention has been given to updating its look. But that does not in any way affect the quality of the food and service

I have been visiting this restaurant (mostly the branch in Little India) with family, friends of non-Indian origin, relatives - regularly for more than 10 years now! This is the ONLY Indian restaurant that has been consistent in quality, taste, price, and service! And, most of the friends n relatives that have joined us to dine there, end up as regulars at Raj!! The food is always fresh; one can rest assured that we do not consume some leftovers! Oil and spice usage is in moderation too - so very much like home-cooked meals. They custom-make the food as per our preference. However, they may not serve everything in the menu all day. And, they do not have much dessert options!I travel widely across India and have eaten a few times at almost all Indian restaurants in Singapore. Raj is one place that I go to when Iâ€™m super hungry or when I really want to eat something like at home. Staff are friendly n respectful - which is very typical of Singapore standards. P.S.: Do try the dosa here folks!!!!

I have been visiting 3rd time during my visit to Singapore. I must say that food is very delicious. We tried mysore masala doss, paneer jodhpuri, vegetables biryani and sev puri. Every dish tasted very well.Staff was very helpful, even in so much rush hour he was attentive.One of their staff is an old guy serving water to everyone, he was very kind, he made sure glass was filled with water before it went empty, a very sweet gesture to all guests there.Food service is fast too. Sometimes you have to adjust due to peak hour. Overall it was great
1
The attitude of their staff is u can wait or take a hike we don't care . Been to many other restaurants who are not known to provide superior customer service but this one takes the cake so far . Their location is also not convenient so why bother to waste your money and most importantly your family time here . So many choices - Swad etc to enjoy good veg food in the area
1
Ambience is not good. The place is very stuffy.Ordered a Pav bhaji and samosa chat. The quality of food and taste is quite bad. It was utter waste of money . We didn't even finish their dishes. We also ordered vada Pav that was even bad. Overall this is pathetic restaurant ,Will never ever visit this place again
1
Disappointed with Raj Restaurant.Ordered simple meal but it turned to be my last visit ever. Plus the service attitude sucks when I reported food is tasteless. I was told this is what it is, no change and I cannot replace with another item. My suggestion Raj Restaurant should learn how to make food from next door outlet Kailash Parbat.
3
The food is okay. Place is also jot very good.
But overall u can ger decent Indian food.
South Indian thali is good. Some north Indian dishes are also good.
4
A bit rough around the edges in presentation, cleanliness and lighting. But the food is very good, waiters are polite and gentle. The price is very attractive.
We've both ordered and gone there a few times.
5
Great food and great service. Take all my friends and family from overseas And they all enjoy the food here. I now go to this restaurant at least once a month.
4
The ambiance is a bit shabby, service is not very friendly, not a place for a "nice evening out" - but if you want an excellent vegetarian indian curry at a very fair price, you have found the right place !
5
It's served pure vegetarian food. n quality, quantity to good. quick service n good staff. all times has group booking. food top up card available .good facility . regular
1
The restaurant is pathetic in terms of serving customers. The people at the billing counter take the take away order and don't notify the customers that the cook does not have the ingredients to make the dish. Then after some time they come up and say please order something else as we cannot refund you the money.The gentle man had no sense of hospitality.....would not recommend anyone to go there
4
This restaurant is right opposite to the Mustafa centre at Syd Alwi road. The place is usually busy in the evenings but our visit was late in the evening and were give seats quickly. Food menus is extensive with North Indian and South Indian food. Food is fresh and tasty. Price is reasonable and service is goo
5
We had been to this restaurant recently and had an amazing dining experience. They serve by far the best jain and veggie food in Singapore! Their Jain Mirch Masala Paneer red gravy is a must try along with papdi chaat. Service is outstanding and so is the quality of food. 35-40$ is an average cost for 2 pax. Strongly recommended for jain and beg food
4
There are so many restaurants to choose from in Little India. Raj is a veg option that serves a good choice of mostly South Indian dishes. It has recently re-published its menu. The new vegetable curry is a great addition. The menu also now indicates what is veg or pure veg (vegan) which is very helpful if you are a vegan. Prices are mid-range. It's pretty good value for money. I have never been disappointed by the food. The environment is a bit basic and the service can be a bit hit or miss, but if the food is your main priority then give Raj a try.
4
The menu includes north and south food and good at taste. The quality is also very nice.I was suprised to fins many people order food for delivery to home. i found deliver do uber eats and food panda all flock to collect their orders.Nice for a quick eats / snacks
3
Good ambience. Attentive staff. Food was served few minutes after we ordered and service was pretty good. Crowded in the weekends. Worth a try!
4
For best chat after 3 pm .this is best . Raj kachori is a must . Even thali is good . It is best located in front of Mustafer center .
5
This has to be the most delicious meal I had whilst in singapore and vegetarian too which was all the better! Please go here!!!! The service was efficient & polite too. If I go back to Singapore I'll head straight to this place!!
5
The meals we ate at Raj were really delicious, really tasteful. The combination of spices was really good. We came back 2 times!
4
Delicious... Great Value & Nice Service !!
Huuuge variety on the dosa menu - Rava onion is my personal favourite !! Chaats are great - and their vada-paav is yumm
The ready-to-eat paan at the check-out is the icing on the cake !!!
5
Nice vegetarian restaurant .. Impressive Papdi chat, paani puri .. . Street food stuff !! Had planned to visit it again before leaving Singapore .. But like my friends say .. There always a next time ... ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
4
Very tasty food,its decently priced like around $20-30 it is very clean,all the staffs are friendly and the menu has tons of options to choose from
4
We had spent more than two hours exploring Little India and it was time for lunch, which was not any easy decision as this quarter abounds in restaurants.However, on the recommendation of our knowledgable Singaporean host, we chose Raj Vegetarian Restaurant, and unassuming shopfront on Syed Alwi Road.We were not disappointed.We feasted on Mysor Puri, Corn Kebabs, Lady Fingers (orca) Masala, and Dosas and Baturas with a variety of dipping sauces.This was the first time I had eaten a totally vegetarian Indian meal, and must admit to surprise at how tasty and variedtheofferings were.Bill was S$49 for the two of us
3
During my previous visit to the Raj restaurant near Mustafa Centre I was quite happy. However I cannot say so anymore. I visited Raj during August with my family. Found unpalatable food, high cost and being served by a dirty waiter. Will not go there again
4
This place has been there since many years maybe 14 years plus . The food is delicious the North Indian or South Indian . excellent food and service .. But looks slightly shabby . It could do great with a makeover . So 1 less for the place but food wise 5 stars .
3
We come here semi-regularly and always enjoy the food. The curry is simple and wholesome and the chaat is always a good starter.
4
This restaurant serve good food and price is economical compared to other restaurants on this road. They call it South Indian Thali but it's not actually it is.
4
They make a decent chana bhathura considering it's a joint with ties to Kolkatta. The sweet lassi is good but wasn't satisfied with the masala dosa. I have tried the rasmalai and rasgulas and they are decent. Great option for folks who prefer to eat without onion and garlic
4
A nice place.. a Kolkata based chain I think.Serve Jain food as well, no onion garlic etc.It's a pure vegetarian restaurant. Location is the good as just opposite to Mustafa gate.Overall, the food is very good in taste...South Indian speciality.And moreover, it won't make a hole in your pocket. Reasonably priced
3
Went for lunch today. Located at Syed Alvi road. Interiors are plane, simple. Cant resist ordering Vada pav because a separate placard is kept along with Menu. Vada pav was disastrous. It was semi vada pac-semi Burger. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect onion, tomato etc between bun and pav. Raj kachori was good. Paneer in starter and veg was fresh. Otherwise the food was mediocre, nothing great!Service was quick. Offers variety on menu and is reasonably priced
4
I had been many times to this restaurant and found one the best vegetarian restaurants around. Food is very delicious. Raj Kachori is superb. Service is good. Today ordered a Paper Masala Dosa and found a hair in Dosa. A bit disappointing. As a whole will recommend it.
4
Raj is a vegetarian restaurant, which started in the early 2000. Food has been good and a good bet for vegetarian food. I have been here several times and never been disappointed with the fare. We had puri, channa bhatura, and mango lassi. It was as always good, but, the prices have gone up quite a bit. Still recommended for good Indian vegetarian food
3
Service good attentive staff. Food ok not exceptional. Eaten better in Calcutta. Need to work on decor of the restaurant. Looks run down. Walls ceiling grimy old furniture. Price a bit ex $15 per person order two dishes plain rice and one naan. 10% service charge.
3
Found this place on Google Maps. The interior is quite uninspiring: dark, with very dated decor. It seemed to be clean though. Had samosa (very good), naan, daal-e-raaj and rice (average). Service is very prompt, however somewhat hurried: they start clearing dishes when you stop eating, without asking whether you are finished. The staff speaks very limited English. Credit card accepted with a minimum of SD 20
5
I am a regular at this restaurant. Being a vegetarian, we find consistently good food here. Of all the restaurants in Syed Alwi Road, some of which are famous chain of restaurants in India, this is the first restaurant that we consider while planning an eat-out. Starters are quite good - our favourite being paneer chilli mili, though chaat items are just okay. All South Indian dishes are excellent. Idlis are quite good and Dosas are better than what you get elsewhere in the same road but the masala in the masala dosa and even samosas are a bit oily. North Indian dishes are also consistently good - stuffed kulchas are quite good.Consistently good food, good value for money. Service is efficient and quick. Would surely recommend this restaurant.
4
Wife had a Mysore dosa with very good taste. I had tomoato uthappam which was quite good. Both vegetarian from their South Indian menu.
Air conditioner was not up to the task as a thunderstorm approached but no worse than most restaurants in South India.
3
Came here for lunch today. Food was actually quite decent but the service was poor: slow and lacking in any kind of enthusiasm. Condition your expectations before you come.
4
This place is opp Mustafa Centre. It has all fast food options we get in India from Pav Bhaji to Chaat and everything. It also has awesome South Indian Cuisine.
4
I visited this restaurant located opposite the Mustafa Centre on Syd Alwi Road in Singapore. I had gone with my family for Indian food at a reasonable cost. First of all I was surprised with the Indian-ness of the restaurant. It was Christmas time and the premises was well decorated. The behavior of the staff made us comfortable. We initially ordered Indian chaat dishes like golgappa, dahipapri etc. We were quite impressed with the preparation. We decided to order the main dish too. Our observation is that the dishes like malai -kofta,paneer butter masala as also the lachha paratha were well made. The Indian sweets were excellent. The bill was quite reasonable as compared to similar restaurants in the neighborhood. Overall it was a good experienc
4
I've only been here twice and has since fell in love with their menu, food and all that there is. It's Indian cuisine and it's vegetarian -- two great combo on my dictionary! I love their appetizers and garlic naan bread! Still, I can't memorize the names of their dishes (my bad:() Overall, the food is a must try. Go for something you like and something you haven't tried. Their food pairings are always spot on delicious. Plus, you can always ask them for their best sellers
5
I love me some Komala Villas, but when I'm looking for a slightly more elevated dining experience, Raj is where it's at.Whether going for Kashmiri curry, Palak Paneer, or just a double helping of garlic naan, everything at Raj is impeccable - even the non-veg among us will barely notice the lack of meat. Raj is great for takeout or dine in, and their staff is warm and friendly. A must-visit when checking out the Little India area
1
Firstly the waiter lack basic courtesy and manners. They think they know everything and are really rude. It seems as if they are paying you to eat. We ordered food and told them explicitly that they should put no garlic in anything. We asked them to let us know if they cannot do it. Yet they bought food with garlic and started arguing that there is no garlic in the food. They would not accept. We wanted to order one more veg without garlic but they never came to take the order. The guy at the counter also showed no accountability. Never go there. Kailash Parbat few steps away is a much safer and better choice. The owner should do something about his employee
3
They have north and south Indian food. We tried the north Indian food. We were with an Indian vegetarian couple. They wanted to eat in an restaurant where no meat was prepared. We all liked the food. It was really very good.Location is very good. After dinner you can go shopping at Mustafa. Don't expect any service. We were there on a Saturday. Very busy. People waiting outside. Waiters were friendly but couldn't handle it. We even had to ask for cutlery and plates.... It is also a noisy place.
4
This is a very good vegetarian restaurant for the vegetarian people. You will love it I assure you. This veg point is at a walking distance from Little India and much closer to Mustafa Centre. The taste is Indian cuisine originated. The staff are very friendly.
1
We went for snacks around 6 pm... Ordered Raj Kachori and were thoroughly disappointed... Fast service is good but not if it comes within 90 seconds of giving the order it proves the chef didn't put any effort into a snack dish that cost 8 dollars... The only filling it had was black gram... No green gram or chickpeas which were present when we had this amazing dish at the restaurants Biopolis Way branch... The adjective changed from amazing to pathetic... On telling the cashier or the one who took the order, they didn't pay any heed even though the restaurant was almost empty... Really poor service
4
Pros: Tasty food, reasonably priced.
Cons:Too crowded sometimes,esp weekends.
Must try? Malai kofta, with naan
4
chat as well as a la carte items are nice. Service is good too. Good option when shopping around mustafa
4
Good food, elaborate menu. Decent service. North indian preparation is very nice. Always enjoyed having food here. Must visit for indian vegetarian food lovers.
4
very tasty and perfect indian foood ... very decent behavior of the people.... even the jalebi and puchkas that my daughter loved to eat were there. It made her soo happy and thus i got happy too... thanks RAJ
3
I was on tour from India and my wife was in great t need of indian food after we toured bankok and malaysia and this we found near our hotel.My wife ordered thalli and I ordered dosa and uttapam.The food was excellent.There is big menu of indian food.Food is fresh,good tasty,prompt service and staff also good.Being Indian they welcome customers with love and respect.Some young are talkitive also.Good to visit
4
I have been a regular customer of Raj Restaurant and I have to say it has been consistently good for years. I love their extensive dosai and uthappam varieties. Believe it or not, the list extends to 73 types of dosai and uthappam. The dosai comes with 3 chutneys, usually it's tomato, mint and coconut. A small bowl of sambar is also served along with the chutneys. I have tried their north Indian dishes too. Tandoori and paneer items were impressive as well. Love their rasa malai and kulfi. Masala tea is good too. Overall, great food, good service and reasonably priced food
4
Pros: The food is really tasty. Freshly prepared and well presented for Lil India.The staff is very friendly and happy to discuss the menu.I generally have their Thali. Today I tried the Vada Pau which was on special. It was amazing!Lastly, there's a very kind and elderly oriental gentlemen who attends to most of the tables. He doesn't smile much but he's a really nice guy. He's great!Cons:I think they to however need a refurbished wash station and toilet
4
Me and my son tried Kadhai paneer and Tandoori Rotis on the first visit and the dish Kadhai paneer was awesome. To our surprise, even the Tandoori Rotis were perfectly made out of wheat flour and not refined flour as you generally find nowadays in India . All our dinners thereafter were at this place . Good food reasonably priced with good service. The place needs to be brightened up a bit
1
Had an extremely bad experience eating at Raj (near mustafa). We were served cold sambhar with cold masala in the dosas and when we requested for it to be hot.. we were told they will serve us hot sambhar seperately. Even with repeated reminders... all we got was a standard reply "its coming" every 5 min. Almost finished with the meal since we were hungry. . When we ordered another dosa... we reminded them that the sambhar hasnt reached us yet. The fat guy with spects... who is probably the manager there (name- Muthu.. if he told us correctly) told us that " all other customers are eating with no complaints and if we are not happy with the food, we can eat elsewhere in future."We were left aghast. All I can say is... they definately dont have any respect for or value their customers. A complete no no for future and an extremely bad taste today. Can best advise to stay away unless cold food and bad service doesnt bother you!

For me, a mark of a good Indian restaurant is their palak paneer and fresh brewed masala chai. Palak Paneer is a delicate recipe to make since overcooking the spinach and putting too much dried spices will damage the vibrant green color and over-salting will damage the taste. I frequented Indian restaurants in Southern California and definitely had a fave that made the awesomest palak paneer. The chef claimed that the trick is how the spinach was boiled (uncovered/salted water) and the post-boiling process (soaking the cooked spinach in iced-water prior to puree-ing). I think that Raj did this same process and I am super ecstatic!Woohoo! Raj's palak paneer and bhindi masala were marvelously tasty - clean tasting too! Though the garlic naan was too greasy - I am used to the clay over version of cooking the naan. Thus, RAJ is highly recommended because of its vibrant green palak paneer, bhindi masala (could use some more spice next time) and the heavenly fresh brewed masala chai. A caveat: parking is horrendous per my friend particularly on the weekends. We got lucky as we parked across from the restaurant for my first visit at Raj. Will definitely come back! Next time, I got to try their dosas
5
We ordered different types of dosas and a meal. Surprised to have it in such wonderful mix of flavors. Honestly, I have tried several such dishes in South India like A2B, Sarvana Bhavan etc but this one was quite different and I really loved it.
5
we love raj restaurant infront of mustafa.we like all snacks here.tamoto soup here is simply superb.North indian and vegetarian dishes are very well made.This restaurant is highly recommended always
4
the background of this restaurant indicated that it was founded in kolkatta. so i was disappointed to learn that mishti dohi (sweet yoghurt, a bengali favourite) was not on the menu. we were informed that this item is only available on occasions like deepawali.the strength of raj is primarily in dosai and idli varieties - about sixty vatieties of dosai (including uttapam). the choice is immense indeed.we tried the rawa masala and as requested it was served crisp with the usual chutney and sambar accompaniments which were in generous quantity.the thali was very decently presented, with extensive choice of six vegetables, curd and sweet dish (halwa). two chappaties and steamed rice were more than sufficient for one person.the chaats at raj are also very authentic and delicious.we however found the palak paneer (over coloured and with too much coagulant) was somewhat different from the usual palak paneer dish.the naans were very goo though.the kulfi was seriously flawed - cystallized and lacking the subtle flavours.the staff however were very attentive, smiling serving orders expeditiously.the price at raj is very reasonable and one should be able to get a highly satisfactory meal (with some exceptions,explained above
4
I think the service at Raj has actually improved since the last time I visited. The menu looks as good as ever, with plenty of choices. There are at least 30 varieties of dosas alone, along with thalis, chaats and a la carte north Indian food. Good place to go if you are in a large group and different people want to eat different things. The sweets are only so-so
4
We have been to Raj couple of times... Tried Samosa and was good.. Very authentic... Al-carte menu was also good.. Tried Paneer Kali Mirch and was good..Nice portion size and not very expensive. Finally once we tried the veg meal and I was not very impressed with that. Some of the dishes were pretty average. The kheer was good. Service was good. Would advise to try the chaat and select your alacarte. Decent ambiance. One of the better options near Mustafa
3
I heard excellent reviews and went there with great expectations. I tried the raj kachori. It's basically a improvised version of Dahi kachori! But it's delicious! Worth a try! We then ordered achari panner, again good but I would have been happier if it was properly marinated! Rotis are ok! Nothing spl , so was the rice n curry! We ordered a 4-course meal, believe it or not, we were out of the restaurant within 30 min! It makes me think if any of these items are freshly made! All in all, a decent restaurant, but am sure u will get the same or better quality food with same price in many nearby hotels!
4
Been to Raj both in Little India as well as Biopolis, multiple times (more than 20 times) in the last two years. Biopolis mostly for lunch with colleagues and customers and Little India (Syed Alwi Road) with family and friends visiting from India. Always, always love the food and never get bored! Amazingly refreshing taste every time and absolute value for money. Courtesy wise, Biopolis staff are better than those at Syed Alwi outlet
3
used to be a regular to this restaurant with the family. Unfortunately the quality of food has suddenly gone down over the past 2 years and hence hardly visit it now days.Staff service is a bit arrogant - I am right and you are wrong - attitude which sealed it for me.Shame because this was good when it first started.Maintaining high standards of food and service over a number of years is hard to do and Raj has failed at maintaining both. Sad for my family as we used to enjoy this place for a Sunday afternoon meal
5
Raj is a great restaurant for the best reasons: food! They have a north and south Indian menu, with lots of possibilities not usually seen, and also an excellent chaat bar for little extras.They also do not rush people out when they've finished, and do not harass you to buy more if you just want to talk. The decor is nicer than most places, the food is good, the staff are helpful without being clingy: perfect. Our favorite restaurant in Singapore
3
Raj is your typical Indian restaurant in Singapore - which often have great food that is completely undone by indifferent service that destroys your overall dining experience. Raj, in fact, has one of the best menus in Little India, especially when it comes to down to south Indian food. The menu lists at least 30 varieties of dosas (Indian crepes). We tried some exotic ones (such as cheese rava masala) and found them to be pretty good. Alas, the service here is indifferent at best, with staff that is clearly not incentivized or motivated. Raj has a tough competitive environment with both Murugan's and Bombay Cafe nearby which have far better service. Pricing too remains a bit on the high side, given the overall standards. Chaats like Raj Kachori are prices at S$7. Dosas are decently priced, though. I did not try the usual north Indian fare or the thalis
4
Tired of Murugan Idli, you can try out Raj. Its good an extensive Menu, you have both north and south Indian options. Quality of food is good and the service is also good.
5
They have couple of outlets in Singapore which serve Indian food (both North and South India - try out the North Indian Dishes) of similar quality.....i am overall very impressed with the consistency of the quality, taste and service that you get in all the outlets.....We partronize the outlets in Syed Alwi Road (Little India) and BIOPOLIS (Bouna Vista)....KEEP up the excellence and good service going on..
2
Claiming to be a good Indian veg restaurant. But sad enough that is not true. The dishes are tasteless, they never heard of spices. Dishes are incomplete, no traditional sides dishes. And finally no selection of deserts, exactly that wherefore teh indian cuisine is so famous. Be claver, avoid Raj
5
Came here with my wife and honestly we were really lost with what to order as they had a large list of curries (or gravy as they call it). The waiter gave us some good recommendations and we had a mixed vegetable curry and another one that was a dry-type curry.The food was excellent and very authentic! I wish I could go there everyday !Service was good too as the waiter who took care of us was friendly and polite. The restaurant does take credit card and we didn't make any reservations in advance.Would love to come back here again!
5
The food was excellent. The ambience is very basic and the service can be somewhat indifferent but the food - WOW ! This place does chaats, north indian and south indian and is very good in all three areas. this is rare even in India. the dosas were some of the best we ate anywhere. om food taste and quality they would be considered very good even in India, you can imagine outside India this would be brilliant. the location is very good and right next to mustafa - this made us go to this restaurant twice in our 5 day trip :-)

9 June, 2012HI gUys i want to warn you to do not go such a stupid place there we paid higher price but we getting terrible service then a food court,no doubt they have very good food but the service wise they continuously going down worst and worst the attitude of staff very bad specially the manager who wearing specks and a bit fatty manwe used to go there regualarly since last 4 years but since last 5 to 6 month we stop to go therebecause we had a bad exeperiencein january so we stop to go there but my daughter loves raj food its force me to come back but unfortunately the same things happen again and even worst experience happen this time.last time we regualarly go there because that time also a fatty manager its look like gujarati he has attitude but he is more better than this and that time they have good service staff. but now i warn to to all of you pls dont go there. people going restaurant for celebrating a special occasion but if you going this restaurant your good occasion became worst i had 2 exeperience and even my few friends also told me the same thing thank

This is one of the BEST Indian vegetarian places to eat in Singapore. It has two types of Indian cuisines - South Indian and North Indian. On the south Indian side: The Ghee Rava Masala Dosa is to die for. The podi idli is a personal favorite of every south Indian (I think). They have an extensive array of dosas and each one of them is worth tasting. I really like their sambar. Yum. The south Indian menu is mostly tiffin food like dosa, idli, but they do a decent (and reasonable) south Indian thali for lunch. A FAB culinary experience.On the north Indian side: This place is NOT your home-cooked healthy light vegetarian food place. Very much on the heavier side of North Indian vegetarian food. Truly indulgent, decadent, stomach-expanding, soul-satisfying, meal with oodles of cream and cashew gravies. Super YUM. Paneer Kalimirchi, Dal-e-Raj, Haryali Kebab, Corn Kebab, Palak Paneer, I could go on...Food is chilli, but you can ask for non-chilli suggestions, there are lots of non-chilli dishes in the menu
5
Wide choice of menu - North and South Indian. Vegetarian.Serve in fairly quick time. Quality has been consistently good over the last few years.While pricing is slightly on the higher side, still not over expensive.All in all, a good place if you had to take someone for a meal
4
I was amazed by looking at varieties i.e. North indian, South indian, chinese, snacks.. panipuri, chat etc.. Food quality is very good... very tasty and Chef decorates it also very nicely.Very good desserts also.. Nan, Roti, Kulcha also very good.In starter, try their chinese food, its very good and tast
4
Visited this restaurant near mustafa centre on Feb 14 with my friends...had ensured my friends on good indian food and service....and i was not wrong..all my friends had wonderful time there..the service was quick, staff very friendly and calm...mysore masala dosai was awesome..its been long since i had such a nice dosa after i moved to spore 6 mnths ago frm chennai....i would recommend this restaurant to all my colleagues and friends..
