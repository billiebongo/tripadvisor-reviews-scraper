Had only a cup of their signature tea last week so can't furnish a complete opinion. But going by the popularity of this outlet I think another positive review is in the works.

The best Thai Milk Tea. Pricey but definitely worth every dollar paid.
The long queues are a testament to the fact of its popularity

Looking for a smooth coffee without the Latino or African blend? try this Thai tea and coffee outlet and you won't be disappointed. The fact that this place sees a long queue of tea/coffee takeaway customers after lunch speaks for itself!

There is always a long queue during lunch. Come during off peak hours. TheThai ice tea is super yummy!!

Tucked in a corner of China Square, the place is cosy and quiet when the lunch crowd has disappeared. They serve a variety of Thai milk tea, which are very good, and a few other types of coffees too. I like the prices here, which are much lower than the usual popular coffee chains that are crowded and offer nothing unique.

I ordered Iced Thai milk tea with no sugar. The cashier did key in "No sugar" remark.When I received my drink, it taste sweet. The lady prepared the drink told me that although no sugar is added, because they are using condensed milk, hence the tea will taste sweet. So which word of "No sugar" do they not understand? They make no effort to refund my $$ or offer alternative drink. The cashier should have alerted me earlier! I felt cheated!!!

Excellent service from the crew, always having a warm and pleasant smile, even to the extent to say thank you when you are about to leave the place. NIce ambience. The Thai Milk Tea (Cha Yen) was really authentic. get it cold to beat the heat in singapore. Also order their Shibuya Thick Toast that was made with love. A nice place to hang out. Cheers

The service is amazing. All the staffs are polite and always with a smile on face considering its one of the most crowded Tea Place in Raffles. The guy Huang is very polite and gives a smile every time he serves it. The taste is pretty good too!
