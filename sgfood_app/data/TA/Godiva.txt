Visited their recently opened Bistro in Ion Orchard
We always drop by for a cone or 2 of their soft serve ice cream. We know our chocolates pretty well and we definitely know Godiva soft serve are really amazing!

I was looking forward to try this but the moment i got it from the staff, it was literally melting and dripping ! Thankfully, the ice cream was nice so was a consolation.

Godiva has fantastic chocolate goodies.
It is very expensive, but eat a little piece, and you
will sell your soul to get more :)
My favorite is the white chocolate filled stars.
Not sure what the name of it is, but its excellent.

I went to stall in Suntec Mall days ago. The person who's serve me did a bad job on the dark chocolate ice cream..Nothing look a like their poster in front of the shop.
Ice Cream was delicious though.

Hope Godiva will look into the quality of its ice-cream cone. I bought the ice-cream from Bugis. When I remove the paper, ice-cream was leaking from bottom of cone. Found a small hole at the ice-cream cone. After many times of eating Godiva ice-cream from Takashimaya, Suntec, Paragon, Changi Airport, KLCC and Bangsar Shopping Centre in Malaysia and Taoyuan Airport, Taipei, I never fail to get a taste of it whenever I see Godiva ice-cream and it had never disappoint me. However, the quality in Bugis seems sub-standard. The cone is not crunchy and fresh.

I visited their outlet at Vivocity. It was a small outlet, but the way they arrange the display rack is just so beautiful.We tried their soft ice cream and it was so amazing. It was soft and melt in your mouth. You can still taste their Belgian dark chocolate flavor. Slightly bitter but match perfectly with twist taste of white choco. It was a perfect balance of sweetness!! Taste wonderful!!Too bad, only mini version was available at that time. The staff was so informative when we asked about their pralines and truffles

We discovered Godiva chocolate ice cream last year on a family visit to Singapore I the Raffles MarketplaceOH MY GOODNESS this ice cream is to die forWe then made sure to visit EVERYDAY :)Needless to say I went straight back this visit and made sure I took a photo to tease my children what they are missing out on (I also purchased some Godiva chocolates to take home for them )All I can say is thank goodness we don't have this in Australia because I don't think I could control mysel

Godiva Soft Serve! Excited and curious to give it a try since I'm going to Takashimaya Department Store today.Godiva Shop located at Basement 2, Takashimaya Department Store, 391 Orchard Road, Singapore 238873.For $8 The Soft Serve I suppose to be wonderfully rich, creamy and chocolatey. Unfortunately~ Godiva in Takashimaya, the waffle cone is not that crispy, the almond praline was not coated well and simply finished with a drizzle of dark chocolate sauce only. It's totally different from the one I've tried in Godiva HK. That was real Goddess! No matter how; Godiva Chocolate, Chocolatier, Luxurious Gift, Finest Ingredients, Innovative Boxes, Enticing Recipes, Eye-catching Decorations, and Finest Textures~Godiva is still one of the best and wonderfully rich Soft Serve among the rest.
