If you want a filling but delicious lunch you don't have to look any further. Not much space to sit and right on the corner so bit noisy but the kebabs were fabulous

there are hits and misses with this place. the size and shape of the wraps seem to differ every time I am there. but when it's good it really hits the spot! good quality meats and the arabic rice is great too.

Had my dinner here during my stay in Singapore. They server Veg/Chicken/Lamb Kebab wraps at a decent price. Taste was also good. Service is quick and staff is friendly. Very close to city Hall MRT station.

The veg falafel kebab option is superb. Take a wrap and enjoy it with a chilled beer! The service is quick and food affordable

I came across this place about 4 years ago on one of my many travels to SG, was staying at the Swissotel Stamford and just wanted something different to eat. Ive been there since about xx(too many to count) times and tend to find my way there every time im in SG. Ive since moved hotel and now typically stay elsewhere but the spicy QBabs always tempt me to go back.couple of things that I like1) its fast, it gets made in less than 10 mins2) the staff though they have changed a few times all seem to be the really nice type and are always open to making it exactly how I like it.3) Well located a short walk from the station and a short halt if your going past4) Makes good take away packagingThe seating there could be better though.. went there with my 7 year old on one of my many trips and it was tough to get he sitting on the tall stools :)I will definitely keep going bac

Hungry in Raffles City Singapore. Look no further? hand crafted kebabs.... Had dinner with BIL who came in by MRT. He was hungry after hard day at work. We went to the first basement in Raffles City and looked for kebabs. What is on the menu? He had a lamb kebab. I had the Arabic Rice. This was nice with smooth well oiled rice rice in spices ? tumeric. With chicken and salad of onions, tomatoes and lettuce. Hefty serving of rice. Didn't need to order desert. The rice kebab would be good for people with gluten sensitivity. Especially those on gluten free diet. The kebab looked smaller as it was pressed on the special toaster before it was served. There were no tables only rectangular bars with high stools. Not alot of seating. Heavy traffic around the corner counter kebab shop. Good for waiting for friends or watching out for people when you are having lunch. See the prices, numericals represent Singapore dollars, from their website http://qbab.com.sg
