We went to this restaurant to celebrate Valentine's day and had the lobster burger set and cider. The lobster meat was large and juicy, it's definitely worth coming here for.
5
We ordered Surf and Turf, and they were so delicious! The lobster and steak were prepared to perfection. Service was impeccable, not to mention the stunning view. Lovely place!
5
Great beef Burger and lobster burger was so good. Fish pie was great too. Superb service, busy, great vibe, consistently good. Great to watch the light show in the evening on the hour. Get there early though because it gets very busy.
5
Visited the pelican to celebrate a birthday. We had the steak, lobster burger and snapper pie which we all enjoyed thoroughly. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service. The staff were attentive, warm and friendly. Would definitely come back!

Just had a very nice business dinner here with a colleague from out of town and several from Singapore. The staff are very attentive and helpful. The view of Marina Bay is great and if you time it right you can watch the light sow from MB Sands while you have dinner. The steak I had was cooked to perfection. The fish pie my colleague had was the biggest I've ever seen and had a wonderful plate presentation. I did however think that the barramudi dish was kind of a small portion, it would not have filled me up
2
It was an ala-carte brunch with a limited order of one main per person. The main was huge and there was this notion of having to pay $10/100g of food wastage. Of course we're against food wastage so we attempted to order a customised version of the main as we wouldn't be able to finish it. The main consisted of whole barramundi, four oysters, whole squid and a whole lobster. My hubby was not keen to have a second helping of oysters, barramundi nor squid so requested for his main to just have the lobster but it was not allowed. We wouldn't be able to finish a second main hence hubby ended up forgoing his main and made do with filling his hunger with beef sliders instead.The sliders were generally yummy. But found most of the food a little too oily for our 14 month old. Not an infant friendly food place. The waiters took a half hour to finally register our request for utensils for our little one, while she attempted to pick on her linguine with her hands. Guess she felt a little neglected by the servers too.We took the seats outside and everyone loved the breeze and the view. Wouldn't come back for the brunch definitely. They had few customers yet service was slow. Pretty disappointing as it was meant to be a pre-Valentine's celebration for us too. Poor us, young parents.
3
Food was average with a little portion, perhaps due to it‚Äôs fine dining. The description of the waiter for whopper pie dessert was fantastic, but turned out only average. The ribeye beef was slightly salty. The t bone pork was served in small portion. The view was nice as it‚Äôs just opposite marina bay sands, if you are going for a date.
1
I was so pissed till I left the restaurant without ordering . Bad service , crew was giving us a black face and just threw the utensils and paper towels on the table. Never going back 
5
Was there with our friends celebrating a birthday and dinner. The staff was friendly and didn‚Äôt chase us to order when our friends have not reach. We left the restaurant late yet the staff did not chase us out and allow us to maximize our stay till midnight!
3
I came here last week for lunch with a friend. No problem getting a table at lunchtime on a weekday without a reservation. The menu isn't particularly cheap, but the food is of reasonable quality. The beers are good value though and so we had a beer each (1:1 for most of the day it seems)
4
Had a great night at The Pelican. The service was good, just that when we ordered the Snapper Pie, the waiter could have highlighted the pie is quite big and good for sharing. We ordered individual portions which came up to alot of food.
5
We had a table outside late at night and had a great view across to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The meal was fantastic with a good variety for the 8 of us that were there.
4
My favourite lobster burger! Large chunks of lobster meat (not a fried patty!), topped with honey caramelised bacon and melted cheese.
4
Portions were large, but commensurate with prices. Probably best to share 2 mains between 3 people. Service was quite attentive. Chili crab linguine was a bit too sweet for my liking.
4
The snapper pie was impressive! Other items we ordered were ok, but overpriced. The round seats are too cramped and quite uncomfortable. Probably outdoor seating on a cool day will be great.
5
My 2nd time there at pelican. 1st time seated indoor and the interior deco was beautifully done with nice ambience. My friends (their 1st visit) enjoyed the food and the services provided by the waitresses and waiters there. Will definitely recommend to more friends and be back for their food.
4
Went there to celebrate my wife birthday. Made a prior reservation using chope and indicated that I will be using the entertainer app. The staff promptly show me my seat upon arrival and inform me of the item that are eligible for the app. I thought this was a nice touch as i do not need to ask her about it. We both order the lobster burger and it was fantastic. We enjoyed the lunch. towards the end, the staff present a scope of ice cream and a birthday card for my wife. this was a nice touch, especially so when the card had hand written messages from the staff.enjoyed the food and the service, will definitely visit here agai
4
The salmon pie is a must try when you go to pelican. It is a unique cream based baked pie and it is very tasty! Service was excellent as waitress still take their time to recommend the menu. Atmosphere is nice as we enjoy chatting, drinking and eating under the dim light with a comfy sofa seat. One bad point is that our table are located behind a wall, so you might have difficulty reaching out to the waitress
4
Had a family meal with wife and son. Ordered the steak and lobster burger. Food was good and service to match with it. Location is fantastic as we went for a after dinner stroll and caught the laser and lights display from Marina Bay Sands resort
4
The food is excellent. You can also get to see the MBS lightshow (albeit from afar) if you sit in the outdoor section. However, it was pouring when we arrived and the hostess insisted that we cannot sit indoor as it was full, but throughout dinner (we stayed from 6pm to 9pm) it was never full indoors. She also wanted to wedge us into this tiny space in between the bar area and the restaurant, and when we requested to sit under a fan, she insisted that we had to say so when we make the reservations. We have to be very firm to secure the table under the fan and as we were one of the first customers to arrive for dinner and the outdoor area was empty except for one other table. She said it was first come first served but don't know why she kept saying we couldn't sit under the fan. Other than that, we was ok outdoors even though it rained and stopped 3 times throughout dinner. The male server very good, but other female server was blur. When we wanted to order more cider, she had to call another server over just to take our orders
5
Food was very delicious, service staff was friendly and happy. We ordered sharing plater for 4 pax With a bucket of oysters and prawn. It was just nice.
4
The lobster burger was delicious and worth the money. If you are a chocolate lover, do give whoopie pie with extra whoopie a try too.
5
Very delicious snapper pie and lobster burger! Went back twice within 3 weeks. Though the service was a bit slow as there were really crowded but the food made up for it.
4
Great food, especially the lobster burger and snapper pie! Thank you for the excellent service, had an enjoyable birthday celebration for my Friend!
5
Perfect place for a romantic dinne w superb experience. Love the food as well, top quality. (: my date and I really enjoy myself
5
Awesome time with friends down with an awesome view and food. Have to single out Viknesh for great service and friendly banter. Highly recomfor food and viewüëç
4
The restaurant has a nice and cosy vibe overall. The waiters and waitresses were generally very helpful.
4
Our first time and we went on a Friday afternoon. The food was pretty nice and you can enjoy the nice view of marina bay sand
3
we were there for the sunday brunch ($98++). my favorite was actually the steamed broccolini. the platters were average and raw oysters were not even as fresh as some hotel buffets. all the sliders were pretty good but after the platters we were too full to order more. my kids didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the food at all, but luckily it was free for kids below 9. service was great and prompt though.
4
Fantastic view of the Marina Bay area I must say. We tried the lobster bun and the snapper pie. The former has a few slices of bacon that delightfully tastes like bak kwa. But other than that, I think I would still prefer the good ol' lobster roll instead. The place is situated at One Fullerton, makes it easy for bar hopping, or just chillin at the Starbucks round the corner after dinner
4
Served a great burger and good beer. Staff very friendly and helpful. Stunning views across the marina
4
The seafood here was lovely and we sat outside so the surroundings were lovely. Service was a little slow though.
4
The service was slow, but I have to say I had one of the best hamburgers I have ever had. They have a patio that you can sit by the water.
5
Had a wonderful experience at The Pelican for dinner for our anniversary.
Staff was extremely attentive, engaging & informative.
Food was excellent especially the Snapper Pie (there is a 25 minutes waiting time, but it was worth it!).
Really recommended!!!
4
Service a bit slow. Probably because of staff shortage. Had to request for water and empty glass a couple of times. Starters, salmon and salad was soso for the price nothing special. only steak is worth going back for
5
The pelican- 1st time here. The foods were great and delicious! We are well taken care. Ambience was nice! One of the staff - Apple, take care of us so well. She is friendly and nice. The manager Andi, is so friendly. We will definitely be back again! Drop by and try their foods , no regrets. The foods are in big portion and reasonable price. I personally love the fish and chips, also the ice citrus tea!
5
We lunched here and fantastic customer service by Viknesh and team who were very patient and looked after us throughout the meal! Food were tasty and well varied.√Ç¬†Reasonably priced for the time you save and for the awesomeness of the food. Would come back just for the excellent hospitality

I made a reservation for 2 pax on Mon, 27 Nov @ 12noon. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a yearly gathering with an old friend visiting from KL. I arrived timely, and surprised to see a big crowd waited at the entrance. I approached an Indian service crew, Vicknesh. 1) He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unfriendly, inattentive, poor personal hygiene (the colour of his blouse is greyish/yellowish instead of WHITE), and zero customer service etiquette. He bluntly told me, the Restaurant is open at 12pm. I shown him the time, exactly 12 (both on my watch & iPhone). Then, he argumentatively said it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s based on the clock of the restaurant which is 5-8mins behind! He further √¢‚Ç¨Àúrighteously√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ told me, as I can see there are groups of people (15-20) waiting, he said: √¢‚Ç¨ÀúI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure you can wait too√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢! Totally unexpected, and am absolutely flabbergasted...2) Impression I had of The Pelican is a relatively fine place to dine, never √¢‚Ç¨Àúhawker√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ centre like, as people cluttered around the entrance whilst service crew get ready √¢‚Ç¨Àúslowly√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ instead of usher guests to be seated at the outdoor area (empty during lunch)3) I asked to speak with the Restaurant Manager, a Filipino guy came without introducing himself. As I provided my constructive feedbacks, he was smiling his way, as he finds it funny !! I seriously wondered...so, much so that I asked him, am I entertaining? Guess what? He said √¢‚Ç¨ÀúYES√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢! Bravo Well, you may now understand the reason(s), as The Pelican is managed & service crew is under this level of √¢‚Ç¨Àúleadership√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m deeply disappointed, as I returned after a great dining experience on 17 Nov, attended by an excellent service staff, Kelvin! To my astonishment, service level & experience can be such a vast difference during lunch and dinner! As for the food quality, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alright after the Amex 50% promo (it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be overpriced without discount in my opinion). View overseeing the marina bay is great, but other restaurants can offer similar views too!
4
Their food is pretty nice especially if you like seafood and if you choose outside table, you can enjoy the nice Marina Bay Sands√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ view, but they did not remember my orders; then, I had to tell my order them more than twice. It was nice service though.
5
We had a family dinner at The Pelican earlier this week. Reservations were fuss-free. There are waterside al fresco or air-conditioned indoor dining sections. The air-conditioning was not functioning that evening but the indoor temperature was not too uncomfortable. We ordered a selection of appetizers, soups and main course. The lobster bisque, clam chowder, New York Strip steak, chili crab linguine, snapper pie and lobster burger were all excellent. Though the prices are premium, the excellent attentive service made it worthwhile. The 1-for-1 house pour wines helped us enjoy the occasion even more. We were given a complimentary slice of cake and candle for celebrating a birthday there. We plan to return to try more interesting menu items and bay view at an al fresco waterside table
4
liked the ambience there, facing with a nice view of the Singapore river.
had the tiger prawn and lobster burger and both were good.
5
Lovely food, good location, smiling staff, amazing service, good food. Must try ! Meet was one of the very good waiters there.. The grilled seafood platter was amazing !
5
Nice chill and relaxing atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon. Nice view of Marina Bay Sands and waterfront.
4
Fresh Seafood with easy access from / to Merlion park. It was a business dinner with visitors from overseas and they also liked this place both for food & location.
5
We celebrated a friend's birthday and the restaurant provided excellent service! They served a cake with a special sparkler candle and my friend was pleasantly surprised. Thank you Sherry and staff for the wonderful service despite the busy peak hour.

My wife had decided on the venue, so we made it there recently for lunch during Singapore Restaurant Week. This biannual food festival gives an opportunity for participating restaurants to reach out to a wider audience with a simplified two- or three-course lunch and/or dinner menu. The restaurant's venue, on the waterfront, is stunning, with grand views of Marina Bay from the al fresco tables. Diners can also choose to dine indoors, and being locals, we chose to dine away from the afternoon heat. My wife enjoyed appetisers of baked oysters, mains of wood-fired ribeye steak and spicy lobster pasta, and closed with a rather delicious avocado panna cotta. Service was polite but our orders for drinks somehow got missed out but arrived eventually after checking with the staff. I can't helping it would be nice to go back for dinner at a not-too-distant point in time
3
I used to visit pelican so often because I like their atmosphere, service and foods. However, last frdiay, the service was terrible. We ordered 6 drinks and it took more than 30 mins. We only ordered beers, wine, whiskey. I don't know why they needed so munch time to prepare drink. Also, I asked them iced water twice but they didn't serve in the end.Of course, the truffle fries took more than 30 mins too. Well, it was so disappointed. Not sure if I will visit again.
4
I requested for an outdoor sitting, which is perfect on a Friday night as we get the MBS night lights at 8pm. The group of us ordered the lobster burger, ribeye, chili crab pasta and grilled barramundi. The lobster burger has 3 huge chunks of meat, but I find it odd that the bacon is sweet. The ribeye was tender, even though we ordered medium well done. The chili crab pasta was a tad on the sweeter side. The grilled baramundi was decent. Overall a good experience
4
I've been there a few times before but this time with a visitor from out of town. My guest enjoyed the food and ambiance, especially the lobster burger.Our only compliant was the air-conditioning in the restaurant, it was way cooler to sit outside with the fan blowing on us than indoors. Otherwise it was a great night with wonderful service from Mario
5
We visited in a large group and were so impressed with the food and service. For starts, they had a one-for-one beer promo and prawn baskets going for 10 bucks each. The seafood platter was impressive and definitely instagram-worthy. Across our table were two other families that were celebrating birthdays, and when they brought out the cake, they had these fancy sparklers that would have put a smile on anyone. Our friend brought his 3-year old son along and the servers immediately asked if they needed children's cutlery. In all, the servers give you a sense of professionalism in their interactions, you'll feel more like a guest more than a mere customer.
5
Great 1 for 1 happy hour before 3 pm on a week day.
Loved the music here. Great job guys!
Very attentive service.
Didn't eat - but great spot for drinks overlooking the marina.
3
The Pelican has great view of the Marina Bay Sands light show, but the food was not impressive. Neither taste nor quantity can justify the prices charged. You definitely pay for the location and the view.
3
Restaurant with marina view. Food is good, portions big, service terrible. Staff seemed a bit confused and it took a long time from getting the menu (came quickly) to ordering. Guests a the next table needed to ask for the ordered drinks 3 times.
3
Took the opportunity to have a few beers with a friend here after work last week. The happy hour is quite good value with 1:1 beers. Good views out over Marina Bay. Only pain point was the smoking at the adjacent table - would really be preferable if smoking wasn't allowed at all
2
Went to the restaurant for the first time with great expectations. First big disappointment - the menu we were presented with, was very different from what we saw on the website. Looks like they have shifted to lower end, casual, burger dishes, - which is not exactly our cup of tea for dinner. The range of food in their website menu included caviar, fresh fish dishes, raw seafood etc. So please NOTE, these are not available anymore. Next, while the restaurant is only half full, the restaurant chose to squeeze us together. The 3 couples of us were all huddled into a row of seats with 3 little tables, where we could literally hear each other's conversation and we were just half an arm apart from each other. The last straw was - we passed our 20 year old French Bordeaux Grand Cru wine to the waiter as he volunteered to decant it for us. We even agreed to the $50 corkage charge. To our horror, first he struggled to open the bottle, he literally turned the bottle upside down to try to get the cork out. Then he gave up and brought it to the bar where someone finally opened the wine. Then he brought it back to us and pour it into our wine glasses as if it was a bottle of coca cola! Honestly, we do not blame him. He is young and he tries. But we blame the restaurant management. For heaven sake, if you want to charge this kind of corkage fee - please train your staff. Food is very average. Crab cakes are too runny, Crab Linguine is ok, King prawn dish is competent but at $48, it is just one prawn as a main dish, may be too little for a guy, Beef Steak is alright. Nothing is memorable. Prices are high for that quality. Location is fine. But will we be investing another Saturday night there soon? I don't think so
5
Chose this bar and restaurant on a previous visit to Singapore so had to go back. It's in a great location at the waterfront with great views across the marina. Very good service here, drinks are great, good strength to the cocktails. Food is also very good here, tasty and good quality. Good music too. Really like this place
5
we had dinner here on a weekday night, restaurant was probably about 80% full. there's a choice of indoor or outdoor seating, with those sitting outside being able to enjoy the cool night breeze and river sights, while those seated inside sat in comfy sofa booths in a comfortable orange lighting ambiance. food was great, we had the lobster burgers, with some corn and prawn sides. happy hour lasts till 9pm, where you can get 1-for-1 drinks, needless to say we drank more than we should have on a mid week work night. enjoyed ourselves a lot, and would love to come back again
2
I had indicated on my chope booking that I would be using the Amex dining privilege, but the server did not inform us of the conditions required.Food was decent, but we would have ordered accordingly to the terms of the promotion. Was a rude shock at the end of the dinner
4
Love the set up of their restaurant. You could choose to sit either outdoors or indoors. We sat indoors and it was cosy and comfortable for the three of us. The food tastes good. I tried the weekend brunch menu of Bagels and I enjoyed it tremendously. Other selections that you could try are the beef burger as well as the crab pasta. The crabmeat in their crab pasta is real fresh and thus enjoyable. But the food is slightly on the pricey side. Using the app Entertainer, we managed to get a one for one though. I would advise against their cider as they taste more of effervescence than the fermented fruits. But on the overall, I would say that the food is worth the money
2
Incredibly slow for lunch. My colleagues and I all selected lunch items from the "lunch set" menu. Our experience has been that this is the best way to ensure limited wait time for the food. The food, once delivered, was good. But honestly, not worth the wait.
4
Service was great and food quality and portion is good. Ambience was nice also as it was not too packed on a sunday evening. Worth a visit!
4
It was my wife's birthday and they did a special cake and sparklers
Food was fresh n good with a lovely bay view. The MBS light show was am additional treat!
4
we ate the rib eye, medium rare and it comes out abit too bloody
we also ate the lobster burger, i thought it was a bit too oily as it was deep fried
4
Had lunch with a business associate. We had the set lunch which was pretty reasonably priced. The spinach salad was good as was the chicken I had for the main. The avocado panna cotta was average. All in, not too bad for a quick lunch.
5
I was at Pelican for their seafood and wine pairing session on 14 Sep 2017. There were five courses and five glasses of wine. The food was fantastic. Wine maker was there to speak with us on the different types of wine served too.I will look for for future wine pairing sessions by Pelican as it was sooo good
4
The Pelican is a beautiful restaurant with luscious banquettes and quirky decor. The outdoor seating boasts of unfettered views of marina bay sands, but isn't exactly comfortable with the hard chairs and Singapore's terrible weather so we opted to sit inside instead.The service was generally good, with one especially friendly server whom made us feel really comfortable.On to the food - we had gotten the crab cakes as our starter, and the snapper pie and lobster burger as our mains. The crab cakes were really good, with huge meaty chunks of crab and a delicious tatare sauce, but were a tad dry. The snapper pie was very disappointing - the crust was thinner than I would've liked, there was an overload of cream sauce, and the snapper was pretty bland. The lobster burger fared much better, with delicious candied maple in the burger and paired with a really tasty side of old bay spiced chunky fries. It was delicious, but nothing to shout home about.Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience, but what The Pelican really needs to work on is its menu as even the strong items were pretty weak
5
We had a lovely dinner with great service and a wonderful bottle of wine, apparently the last bottle of this particular wine. We were sitting inside, because of the risk of rain, but most people stayed outside. This made our dinner more quiet and with the best of service. I would definitely go again.
5
Wonderful setting, great service and absolutely superb food. Succulent, fresh oysters. Crab cakes, crab pasta and the signature fish pie. That was just a perfect dish. I want the sauce recipe. It was a fitting last meal for our last night in Singapore. We'll definitely be back to the Pelican when next in Singapore. Big thanks to Andi and his team for a memorable night
3
The location of the restaurant is good, but we only had drinks (happy hour) and didn't order any dinner (as the limited selection did not appeal to us).We must make special mention about the Manager (a nice and friendly Indian chap) who was so friendly, accommodating and tried his best to make our experience there a memorable one. Even the Trainee female staff who was serving us was very pleasant
5
We have just had dinner at the Pelican and we're staying amazed at how good the dinner and service is at this restaurant . We have eaten at the Pelican many times and it's always excellent. The food is superb from starter to desert. The team are great especially the attention to detail from Viknesh who is the perfect Ma√É¬Ætre D. If you want a fabulous meal with an amazing view on Marina Bay come to the Pelican. One of our favourite restaurants in Singapore
3
Greatcarea to sit and watch the light show and atmosphere of Marina Bay. The deep fried food was a bit heavy and oily for my tastes, but the other dishes were lovely
4
Enjoyed the set lunch here with a colleague. Food was good value for money (we had the steak) and the oyster starter was also delicious.
4
The service was stellar, the ambience was good. Quiet place in the afternoon, more of a night time chill out bar. Food was quite pricey, but tasted rather good.
5
We ordered the fish pie and barramundi fillet, as well as drinks. Food was really delicious and portions hearty. Service was prompt and staff were generally knowledgeable.
5
We had a great evening at this relaxed and friendly venue. Good food great service and not pretentious . We will be back for sure.
3
Nice place with a great view of MBS in the evenings! Food is nice but it used to be much better eg bar menu option so limited now -used to have more selection like white bait and beef sliders which were yumz! And I remember the barramundi was cooked differently which was soooo much better!! On the other hand, service still great as always! Kinda miss the R&B music played by the previous DJ on Fri evenings! Still a great place to chill in the evenings :
3
The bar is well located, on the Marina Seafront with a great view.We ordered the lobster burger and snapper pie, the burger is yummy and the pie portion is big and enough for 2 ! A bit disappointed with The 1-to-1 happy hour wine, it was 1/4 filled, The food are pricey
4
Enticed by 3 course set menu for $38 pre taxes, which of course ended up being way over $76 for 2 because you need to drink and of course if you want the lobster pasta there is a$20 surcharge. Spent about $120 . courses small but well executed. Not given napkins, had to ask for them. Happy hour promotion running for wine which was just average
4
Came here on a sunday night with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary. Booked a seat indoors but took advice from the staff to sit outside as there would be a light show from the MBS side and the ambiance would be better. Had the lobster burger and the ribeye steak. Perfect lobster burger perfect bacon oh my goodness. steak was a bit too chewy for me though. staff could also have been a little more attentive, as the place was hardly packed
5
We had the classic favourite lobster burger and ribeye steak. Service was efficient and server was friendly and attentive with a smile at all times. Tues to thurs they had oysters 3 for 10 dollars. It was a great deal, oysters were fresh and tasted really good, served with lemon and tobasco.
3
We ate outside very limited menu and not much of a wine list either. The quality of the food was poor as well.
5
awesome place to admire the view and chill out in a sunday. despite the fact that tripadvisor says that is closed on sunday here I am lol on a sunny sunday drinking white wine and eating tiger prawns. wich actually i quite recommend for anyone.
5
Celebrating hubby birthday...
Enjoyed our lunch with nice food & atmosphere... Pricey, because it's seafood and the location...
3
Food was yummy especially the braised beef. The bagel brunch set was disappointing as the spread was too salty. The crayfish spaghetti tasted fresh and cooked just right.
5
Most amazing service in such a beautiful spot :) pleasure to meet you viknesh @mickey_vikieboy üíò will definitely be back
5
The service was good, and staff were friendly, exceed the expectation of their guests.
The 'King for a day' promotion was good too.
4
We came here for a Saturday seafood brunch. The location is good and can enjoy a good view of the Barbour of sitting outdoor. As it is bit humid and hot, we stayed indoor. Service and food are good but the choice of beer could be improved.
3
the restaurant is overlooking marina bay . sitting outdoors in a cool night is better compared tonindoors. at 8pm, we were able to see the light show as well. staff wise, the waitress seems not to be in a rush to get our orders and gave out the menus first and only get our orders after 15 mins. food arrived on an average time but was unhappy that my medium rare ribeye steak is well done .
4
On the night that we visited, it was torrential rain and we sat at an outside table under a canvas awning overlooking Marina Bay. Very atmospheric. The fish and steak from the fixed menu were excellent and, best of all, were accompanied by unlimited free-flow beer and wine. Very friendly staff
4
Great location @One Fullerton. Choice of outside and inside seating. Quick service and a good selection of seafood and some meat available. If you are seated outside, you have a wonderful view on the bay and the Marina Bay Hotel, during the evening this is also a nice place to view the Lasershow from across the bay. Food is good & solid quality
3
The food looks appealing but was generally average for what I had. Our waiter was good, friendly & very attentive.
4
Great place to hang out with friends, jumbo scallops are not worth ordering but the fries and grilled pork tbone is great. Can be pricey but made more value for $ through the entertainer app.
3
Nice Ambiance, the restaurant is facing the river and MBS, the seafood is fresh. I would recommend the lobster burger with caramelized bacon.
5
Great ambiance in a prime location by the water front .
Friendly and helpful staff
We ate here on our first night of a 4 night stay and chose to return before we left because we enjoyed our meal so much
5
Great food and service! Had lobster burger and tiger prawns using the entertainer one for one. Great taste!
3
The food at Pelican is delicious and the restaurant itself very beautiful, but for a restaurant of this standard the service is very poor. We had a 1pm booking and were not told until 2:15pm that the restaurant closes at 3 and we needed to make last orders for drinks by 2:30. Had I been told this at the time of booking I would have gone somewhere else given we were looking for somewhere to settle for a sunny Friday afternoon
4
It was a quality restaurant. Everything was of a great standard. The butter banana pudding was heavenly, so were the old bay fries. However I was expecting more from the fish burger. It came across to me as something rather ordinary. However, overall a great experience. Would definitely revisit
5
Had a wonderful last night in Singapore at the Pelican, fantastic views of Marina Bay Sands and the marina.Food and music was right up our street (old school tunes and seafood, but also serve steak and burgers!) and our waiter Viknesh was a lovely, lovely man! Thanks to him for a great night!
4
I found this bar by chance after walking for miles to find the Merlion, realising it was 9pm and feeling peckish. Despite the bar being located in a prime position (the marina bay sands are directly opposite), getting a table wasn't an issue. I ordered the chilli crab pasta and a corona. The corona was great but it was the equivalent of ¬£7 gbp which is expensive but not too uncommon for Singapore, I guess. The chilli crab pasta was amazing but even better was the free corn bread that I was given on the house. It was warm and incredibly tasty! The views are also fantastic, to have a drink outside during the day I imagine would be well worth a visit. The view at night was great too.
2
I came to your bar grill for the second time since last month, but today I didn't enjoy it at all. It was only 6.30 pm, and your place was playing really loud music. I asked if they could put it down a bit, initially they did, a little, but then 10 minutes later they put it up again... you don't really care about keeping your customers, do you? I had to change tables to get into a quieter corner, but there, your wifi signal was very weak... when I sat there, I saw a couple sitting at one of your tables, but when they realized how noisy your place was, they left!.... your waitress, was new, she worked like a novice, not her fault I guess, or badly trained... I ordered a glass of wine, 17 Singapore dollars, and chicken wings.. I wait for the wine for ten minutes, nothing happens... then the chicken wings come, but still no wine... they forgot... 5 minutes later they bring me the 17-dollar glass of wine, ONE THIRD full..... one third.... not really generous of you, is it? All the other times I came to your place before, the glass of wine was properly filled.... are you becoming that stingy.?...really bad customer service today.... I'm never coming back to this place..

Oysters were out of this world but the mains - lobster burger was lacking in lustre. Hardly worth the value.
5
Brought my parents here for family meal in celebration of a birthday. Nice wine selection, great food and good view in relaxing atmosphere with pleasant view of the bay area.
5
I usually go the place for drink and it was my first visit for brunch.
The food was great! and of course the service was nice :)
Always my favorite place to enjoy MBS view!
4
We enjoyed beer and fish and chips - singapore style at this fab bar. Sited right by the bay it has a good vibe. The food was good and plentiful but not cheap. We did have to keep prompting the staff however.
3
The best of this restaurant is the views Of Marina Bay Sands at night and the bay. Nothing else too much special. The food is correct but not excellence, and the service correct as well ... at the end I'm there due I want to enjoy night view of the city
4
A nice place to hang out outside, with a great view. The lobster burger I ordered tasted delicious, with a slighty sweet flavor. My bf went with chili crab pasta - also good. Service was polite and efficient. Music was way too loud though for our taste
4
We recently had two meals at this Seafood Bar. The staff are very efficient and, in the main, smiley. The first meal we ordered was crab cakes, with sides of asparagus and fries. We shared the crab cakes, which were very good and, in fairness, could have shared both side dishes, because the portion sizes are quite large. The second time we ate there, I had the fish and chips, which were excellent, but my friend had the crab linguine, which she thought was only average. Swings and roundabouts really. Prices are on the steep side for the food offered, but it is on the Marina seafront, so it is to be expected.
5
We went to pelican to celebrate my wife's birthday, and we were shown to a nice table indoors as we were afraid of the weather changes. We had a ribeye steak, lobster burger and oysters as they were on promo on thursdays. The food definitely did not disappoint, as the food were very flavorful. The oysters were fresh too, although they were smaller than expected. The portions were pretty huge too, as we both couldnt really finish the fries after eating the mains. The staff were very attentive throughout the meal, and eventually served a free dessert with birthday wishes for my wife. We will definitely head back again for their food and service.
5
We recently spent the evening at the Pelican having dinner and some wine as we watched the amazing Singapore lights. The staff, particularly our waiter Dishant, were exceptionally friendly and very efficient. The location is perfect for relaxing overlooking the Marina Bay and the promenade with the constant flow of people passing by. The food was delicious and was complimented by the wine we had. The prices were also quite reasonable given the location. An enjoyable experience
1
This bar is very well located, with excellent views. But that is all there is to it. Service is not good, drinks are not well prepared and prices are outrageous (Singapore is already expensive, but if at least here drinks and service were good...). In my opinion there are a lot of better places in Singapore and just for the views it is better to go somewhere else
4
Describe the service you experienced >> Good
Tell us how you liked the room >> Yes, We Like.

The heading says it all, great food with generous portion size. The view is also not to bad ether. I'm not a fish eater and this place has me back.
4
Good quality food with different type of very fresh oyster served with a great NZ white wine .... good service and relaxing view....
5
Located by the waterfront, you're surrounded by the beautiful scenery. The food were wonderful. Seafood platter was served fresh and delicious. Servers were friendly and attentive.
3
We sat outside and got to enjoy the view and people watching. Food and customer service was ok. Took forever for them to serve our food and drinks.
5
A pleasant place to hang out after work. Food is delicious although a bit on the expensive side. expect to spend at least 30s for a main course. there is 1 for 1 drinks for most of the night which makes it reasonably worth while.
4
We ate dinner here (tiger king prawns and snapper). Great food & great atmosphere riqht on the water. Seemed pretty busy for a Tuesday night. Friendly service.
4
Pelican had Great Ambience and furniture designs. The food was fresh , the quality was high and the presentation was lovely. I will go back there again.
3
I ordered a snapper pie and pan-fried barramundi. They were really fresh! However, I was expecting a crispier pie crust but it was a lilttle underbaked inside. Portion is big though.
4
My friends and I enjoyed our terrific dinner at The Pelican. Food served was of good quality and service staff were all very helpful. Moreover, there is a 50% discount when there are two adult diners at a table with minimum two main courses by using your Amex card. It's so worth it! Will definately revisit The Pelican for sure
5
The wait staff is helmed by an excellent manager and this Shines through in their ability to cater to each customer!
5
Love their lobster burger. Big chunky lobster meat full of sweetness at every bite. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Awesome dining experience. Will definitely return!
3
Nice waterfront view. Good food. Good service. Only issue is when it rains and it's challenging to sit out
4
The food and service at this pleasant restaurant was very good. Thoroughly recommended for a simple and enjoyable evening out. Nothing more to say really.
5
The seafood platter was excellent. Food was fresh and well presented. Oysters were large and well served!!
4
We called at The Pelican for a beer and something to snack on. This restaurant is in a prime tourist location. As such, we expected average food at high prices. Wrong! Food consisted of a crab cake starter and a cob salad. Both were fresh and tasty. The crab cakes were excellent and contained a high content of quality crab. They were fried perfectly and arrived hot and crispy. The accompanying relish was a welcome addition. We also had the cheapest pint during our stay in the city It was a BOGOF promo. Service was efficient and the outside seating views awe awesome
4
Went there for lunch with my colleagues. We had crab cake and salad as appetizer. Both were good. We had fish & chip and lobster burger as main. The fish & chip came with two big battered snapper fillet and lots of chips. The Fish is fresh and the chips were crispy outside and juicy inside. The Lobster burger taste good too with lots of chips. Obviously we couldn't finish all the food as we were very full. Anyway we enjoyed our lunch. Service is good for servers and one is not so as he seems very new. When we went off, he just looked at us as if we were transparent. Probably he needs more training
5
Pelican offers a beautiful view of the Marina Bay Area with their alfresco dining area. The seafood platter was extremely fresh and juicy. Warm dishes such as the highly raved about snapper pie lived to the hype. The staff were prompt in clearing the table to make space for new dishes served. Service was prompt.
2
 I was very disappointed with the quality of Oyster served at the restaurant. It too big, stale, very thick and chewy. I can't bring myself to swallow it. I feel sick thinking of it now. The other side dishes was too poor quality and price don't justify the dish. Only thing that attract me to go there again is the ambiance and 1 for 1 wine. Service staff are friendly.
3
Return visit for Brunch. Brunch Menu was quite limited for us. Highlight should be their Pelican Platter. As there's only 2 of us, we shared Crab Omelette and Tiger Prawns, followed by Ice Cream. Taste is great, portion served may be small for sharing or for guys. Service is still good
4
Reasonably priced. Small menu which helped. Larger tiger prawns, lobster burger, wagu beef burger, fish all excellent according to my group. The linguine with clams was the only 'miss'.
Nice location. Would go again.
4
Had drinks and finger food here with friends. The fries and hash brown are really nice. The wings are not bad too.
5
Good food and nice view, definitely recommend for any special occasion. The waiter was kind enough to move us to the front seats to have a good view.
4
Pros:
1. Stunning view, across and along the Merlion.
2. Food is good.
3. Price is affordable.
4. Champagne free flow from 1-4 pm was worth and enjoyable.
Cons:
Wait staff could be more flexible in refilling or accommodating request such as asking more butter.
3
The portion size is very small. May have to order side dishes or appetizer to fill your stomach. The food is alright.
4
Took advantage of the AMEX (50% discount w 1 guest) dining privilege to lunch at the Pelican. the 2 fish dishes (Pan fried barramundi and snapper fish & chips) were excellent and portions were quite generous. The Whoopie pie was a little rich for my taste though the gold leaf topping looks decadent. Overall a nice relaxing lunch with good quality food
5
We had dinner at this place often, and it is one of my favourites. It has a great atmosphere, and the view is quite inspiring. If you are here at night, you may get to see the light show. Try to book, so that you can assure a place outside
1
My party of 4 experienced the most intense food poisoning from the oysters on Monday. We were out of work for days. I'm still not quite right. The restaurant didn't return my calls regarding the matter. I was so hopeful for this place to be my go-to seafood restaurant
5
First time dinner here and the verdict is no regrets. The staff were patient and attended to all our questions and served us with a smile. The food was amazing, fish was fresh and the steak was done to my liking perfectly. I would definitely recommend the snapper pie
1
Been waiting for the food for over an hour (and they aren't very busy at the moment), so thought I'd fill the time doing this review!Oh the food has just come ( after chasing them up)Food ok but then had to ask again for cutlery, no chance of a serviette.Now still waiting for second beer?Just not acceptable service, especially as it's not cheap
5
the crabcakes were the star of the lunch, though slightly pricey for just two crabcakes. every bite was full of crabmeat. the lunch deals were quite delicious as well.
5
Food is lovely and the staff is absolutely hospitable.MEET is the name of our server he is very kind and sharp with our orders and requests. Surely we will come back to this place.A must visit!
5
Great service (Meet was our waiter) and very fresh seafood. Pricy but worthy. Stunning views of the Marina Bay.
5
Had a great couple of hours getting some work done. Stunning view, great wine & Vignesh gave me the opp to 'surprise' me with on off menu light bite. Delicious crab cakes.. Highly recommend this place
4
This was my first visit to pelican....good service. But it became warm half way into our dinner.
Manager was good, gave us complimentary cake after knowing we were celebrating burthday
4
The food (burger)was excellent, medium rare as requested and succulent. But that and a few beers for 2 of us reached ¬£100. Nice ambience and view across the bay.
5
Excellent service at The Pelican. Made customer feel at ease and impress with good service. Fresh prawns and great food. Steak was surprisingly good for a seafood plc. Azreen and Andi gave very personalised service and recommendations. Make u feel at home. Gd location with MBS light display when u dine here for dinner. Thumbs up!
4
We ordered the lobster burger. it was good. However, we find the fish pie (with the cooking time of 25mins) is not so tasty. I wont recommend even though it was one of their signature dishes and it was recommended by the waitress. The cream sauce is too dilute and lack of taste
1
Tourist trap!The Indian guy who was the matron d mare had a terrible attitude. Just left me alone despite me telling him I'm in a rush of time.Food was terrible, worst than hawker of fast food.Overpriced Main - garoupa tasted blend, the crustacean bisque was mediocre but it was too small portion and not much ingriedients inside.The dessert donut was inedible
4
Went with a client and was very satisfied with the servings for the 3-course set meal. Food was tasty, though I'm not convinced my tuna entree was the freshest. Stunning views of MBS, but you pay for it. There are heaps of options next door that didn't come up on google, which I wish I had known about... Service was pretty good, with attentive-ish (for Singapore) staff
4
The lobster burger and snapper pie were really good. Prices was a little steep. But the view made up for it.
5
This is the best place for after work drinks, or just waiting for the night plans. 6-9pm is the time.Happy hour during weekdays. Smoking area
4
It's a great place to bring a date and impress him/her. Food is of high standards though could be served warmer. View is fantastic.
4
The Pelican Platter is actually a pretty good deal. The set comes with a whole crab, a lobster, 6 oysters, 6 prawns, mussels and 2 empty buckets [for your trash]. Location is excellent facing the Marina Bay Sands but the service can better.
4
The oysters are fresh and succulent, not to mention huge. Pairs very well with a glass of white wine.
2
spaghetti was undercooked. Waiter kept being defensive and tried justifying it's how this dish should taste.
5
Wonderful services and very great food. I tried the toothfish and the lobster and it was tasty. The food is indeed great!
5
Amazing location with a beautiful view on the MBS. Truly impressive at night ! Attentive waiters and correct waiting times. The food was really good and everything seemed homemade. My highlights : the Pelican Burger and the Banana Bread desert. The prices are correct for Singapore's standards Approved 
2
Became here for an after dinner drink. We took two glasses of Chardonnay. The service was friendly enough, but the wine was slightly warm, and hugely expensive - 40 Singapore dollars. The view was wonderful, but 40 dollars for 2 normal sized glasses of wine? Really
1
The service was incredibly rude and surley - certainly suprising for Singapore. There are better places for a drink in this same area, which is what we came for initially. We would have had more drinks and good but the waitstaff was so nasty they scared us off. Weird
4
Came here for lunch last week and opted for the snapper pie. This takes a while to prepare (and the staff are sure to make that clear up front) but it was worth the wait: really very tasty. Another visit may be in order.
5
Fresh succulent seafood that's worth every penny. Awesome ambience as well. Highly recommend the lobster (grilled) and torched scampi. Service staff were attentive, pleasant and provided incredible service with a personal touch on my birthday celebration. Will definitely return again.
5
Beautiful atmosphere down by the water. Not cheap but then nothing really is in this city. Beautiful lobster salad and seafood pasta. Had a really tasty honeydew melon illusion cocktail which is the signature drink of this venue.
5
Some of the best seafood I have eaten in the world. We shared a seafood platter and the king crab on there was delicious. Only downer was the white wine wasn't chilled!
5
Excellent location, superb service and personal attention, good and tastefull food and drinks.
High price worth paying for. Special table position, great view, nice staff and management with Pleasant and adequate handling-skills.
For sure we will come backüëç!
Thanks for the unforgettable evening!
4
Came for happy hour drinks (1-for-1 beers/housepour/wines). Great location. One of the limited places in Singapore for smokers to chill out to a drink and enjoy a good view. The waiter (a Malay gentleman) was friendly and helpful. We stayed on much longer than expected n he saw to the last detail before his shift ended. Great job!
3
The setting is lovely and the food we had was good. However, there were no clams available for the clam linguine, the service was slow and lacklustre and I even got a phone call whilst sitting in the restaurant reading the menu to ask if intended to turn up and fulfil my reservation
5
A very warmth welcome by staff Rudi. His knowledge on food is superb and recommendation was good, special and delicious. He serves his customers willingly and with a tough of great smile. Besides, the location next to the river was cosy with fantastic view of Singapore. Good place, good food and friendly staff to make you feel like home dining
2
This was not our first visit to this restaurant. Previous visits had yielded good experience and so we planned yet another repeat visit on 5 Aug. To our surprise, we were informed on this visit that happy hour offers on drinks were only valid at the outdoor tables and not indoors. This was highly disappointing. Next we noticed that the food menu has been changed and the previously popular item of Lobster Thermidor had been removed. We then proceeded to order our regular favorite item the fish pie, only to find when the dish arrived it tasted horribly like mustard sauce, totally different from what we had before. Overall it was a horrendous experience and we do not intend to patronize this restaurant again
5
A return visit, this time for brunch. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an option for free-flow Prosecco at SGD 35++ per pax. The Prosecco was just right, not too sweet nor too dry. However, we had to ask for refills each time. Crab cakes were good, snapper pie (a must order!) was a huge portion and delicious. We also ordered fish of the day - pan-fried snapper and pan-fried cod. Both were perfectly cooked, but they could be a bit more generous with the veggies. The four of us were so full after that we just shared the banana bread for dessert - it was just ok. Ask to sit outside if you wish to have dinner or evening drinks there - its just across the water from the iconic Marina Bay Sands
3
Portions did not justify the price. The Seafood Bouillabaisse which was supposed to be a highlight came surprisingly bland, with 2 prawns, 2 mussels, 1 fish and some clams. Quite an underwhelming experience even though restaurant was nicely furnished. And service was not bad.
5
Awesome view.. nice ambience.. awesome staff.. esp this dude!..highly recommended...come down and look for VICKY....cheers...
5
Service was great. Food was great. Staff were patient and very service orientated. Embience was perfect. Windy environment.
4
Second time at Pelican. Love the location on the marina and the 1 for 1 beverages. Food is good, expensive as is all food in SG, but worth it for the atmosphere.
4
After a long day of sighseeing, we stopped in for a drink and some appetizers. View of the bay was great. The food was good and drinks were 2 for 1. Highly recommend as a place for a little R & R after a long day sighseeing
5
I had a very amazing chillycrab pasta ! The package was 38 sgd for 3 courses (starter, main, dessert). There were 3 options but i chose the pasta and it was amazing. The service was good, staff were friendly and they have promotion buy 1 get 1 for lager beer and housewine. My husband come here regularly during lunch time. RECOMMENDED
4
~went with Dana & Fang Ning after work, it was a UOB VI recommendation so higher expectations... very crowded on week night October~dinner service was friendly and fast, at the just right level of interactionOld Fashioned Crab Cakes - oh so YumzGlacier 51 Toothfish - YUMz exactly what the waiter described a fish that had the consistency of lobster?Old Bay Fries - ok lahWhoopie Pie - oh so sweet YUMzbut it was the catch of the day that made it super, pan fried blue cod, it's deliciously fresh :)good place to g
5
Very close to Esplanade theatre, came pre-Les Miserables. Excellent, attentive service. Love the Cloudy Bay wine for a safe all rounder, especially with the seafood. The smaller, French oysters were the best I've had in SG and I eat them a lot! Even my husband (I'm the oyster fanatic) commented that they were the best. Lobster starter so delicate and the fennel accompaniment delicious. Recommend the squid dish too, crispy batter yum. (Could do with a sauce or Mayo, will ask next time ) Had the skate and by this time we were so full, portion was generous but mostly protein so after oysters and starters it was absolutely perfect. Hubby a steak fan and did the unspeakable in a seafood place- but it was amazing. Will be back for sure.
3
Lovely location good vibe, enjoyed the plump fresh oysters & cold beer, after 9pm when u paying full price the service seemed uninterested, so we went up the road for mains & more drinks.. Would try again but the staff need to be providing basic sequence of service
5
I have been to Pelican many times and I always have enjoyed the food, drink there. My fvrt is the crab cake from there. It has got amazing city view and located in very beautiful area. ideal for couples for a romantic dinner date or groups looking for good seafood and drinks
5
Location at its best. Prices are reasonable. Service staff are attentive thought the night can be super busy. Had the oysters, and oh boy...fresh and succulent. Will definitely be back.
4
Not too expensive, outdoor seating with fans to stay tolerable. Lots of fish and two meat dishes. Very nice and a tasty set of desserts. Happy hour from 5pm to 9pm on a range of drinks.
4
Hubby brought me n the kids here for my birthday celebration. The food is great, as well as their service. I love their Pink Moscato! We had a great time here is The Pelican.
4
Food was good, the service a bit slow but busy night, the ambience was good but please tell the DJ to put better music....it was the same but all the time....
5
This place has amazing fish, the crab cakes were delicious, and the lychee mojito is a mist try, thx for the tip Viknesh;)
4
We went to have a dinner on sat evening and the barramundi and rib eye steak was delicious. The oysters were also fresh and very fleshy. Had a nice evening as the restaurant had a nice view overlooking the bay where dragon boat racing and yatch sailing were seen. Would definitely come back agai
4
Walking along the front at Merlion park we came across the Pelican club and decided to stop for dinner and watch the laser show across the water at Marina Bay. Both the food and the location where great for this, however the star of the show was our waiter, Viknesh. He had some great banter, some good recommendations and knew exactly what we wanted before we did. I would recommend having dinner or a drink here anytime, be sure to say hello to Viknesh, top bloke
5
Sitting outside by the water (second time here) was as good as the first. It remained dry and not hot or humid. The service was noticeably professional. We shared the seafood platter which as described is really too much for two people (medium lobster - from Maine probably; large crab, six oysters; clams, mussels; and about eight large prawns). We washed this down with a variety of two-for-the-price-of-one drinks (well 12 for the price of six). The olde crab cake starters were good as was the house burger and fries. There was no room for a desert. In the background the son et lumiere show from Marina Bay Sands performed twice and bats flew unconcerned over our heads among the trees. The price is a little steep but the ambiance and spectacular view make the extra worthwhile for visitors to Singapore especially
1
My 1st visit was on 2nd May with my niece.... Restaurant was quiet and we were the only ones sitting indoor for dinner. We were satisfied with the crab cakes and barramundi. Given the good experience, I went back with my partner for dinner on 17 May and it was bad! The place was crowded. We ordered the raw oysters..... Big and flavorless. The pan seared scallops were over cooked. I had the daily catch which is blackened snapper.... Again over cooked. My partner ordered their signature snapper pie... The crust was yummy but the snapper within is again over cooked. Very disappointing. Both of us had stomach issues in later part of the evening :
2
Aside from an incredible view and good beer (which is not made at this place), I was very disappointed with the poor service. We stopped to have a drink and at 17$ a pint, you would certainly expect some service. But the girls working here viewed customers as a hassle, so I am very sorry I interrupter your exciting day. Fullerton hotel next door has a superb rooftop with as good of a view and impeccable service for same price
3
A nice place to have an early evening drink. Had plenty to choose from. Location is ideal right in Marina Bay and looking out at the gorgeous Marina Bay Sands hotel.
5
I came to The Pelican twice and today is my 3rd. To my surprise, Viknesh recognize me and remember my name. His service is excellent and attentive. I enjoy mostly the prompt service, nice music and breath taking sight. Made good recommendations too!
2
2 years back, portions were large, food had character and pelican was a great place to hang out. Now portions are tiny, music is way too loud, waiters are understaffed and things are more expensive than ever.
4
Very friendly staff- Aidil really looked after us- very helpful. Order the fish pie and you won't be disappointed! Fantastic location and view of bay.
5
There are days when The Pelican has special promotions on their tray of oysters and it makes it worthwhile to also try their catch of the day. Topped off with 1 for 1 drink deals, you're guaranteed a pleasant evening. We had the glacier toothfish (almost like a meaty cod) along with the flounder that was grilled (a beautiful dish that warrants being served on its own) will definitely head back
5
Visited this Bar every evening during our four days in Singapore. Happy Hour in place most days offering 2 for 1 on a range of drinks. Always busy no matter what time we passed or visited this Bar. Staff friendly and checking constantly to see if we needed any further drinks or food. Lovely view of the Bay and got to see several yachts racing on the Bay during afternoons. Great place to sit and relax enjoying the view on offer at same time as having a nice cool drink
1
Pleasant environment on waterfront. However, $8 per oyster ($48 for 6) despite them being listed on a sign as $2 and no mention of different price when encouraged to make choice. No mercy here. Very expensive. Insincere service. A place to avoid in my view unless you have no dignity.
3
Go to the Pelican on Tuesdays for cheap oysters! Only 2 dollars a pop during their happy hour! It won't be the best you ever had but it's decent quality for the price. I remember the red wine here was AverageTried the crab cakes here before, not bad at all, but slightly on the pricey side
5
Its my 2nd visit here. I could not help it but need to let the world knows how service can be more attractive by being casual. made a reservation as advised by the all knowing and trusted server Izad on our previous visit. this time we were seated inside eventhough we wanted outdoor as inform by the reservation department that they do not take reservation after 7pm. greeted by Izad again when we arrive at the restaurant and was serve by the amazing Andi. was told that he was actually the manager there. my friends and i could not believe that even the manager is serving us. we are honoured and looking at the whole restaurant i can sense that all the customers are happy. i am not worried to bring my clients here for a business lunch or dinner. fantastic food even a better service rendered. highly recommended. nice view and i love the ambience
5
Had a gathering of old friends, some of whom I had not met for 30 years here. The decor was great. Food was delicious and the staff was impeccably ready and prompt.The one thing that surprised me was that I call the restaurant to book but was told apologetically that they do not take reservations and the phone conversation ended. Then I spotted the restaurant on Chope and made a reservation on the website. A staff called and informed me that they do not accept reservation for outdoor, but if I am keen, he can move my reservation on Chope to indoors
5
Ambiance was good, music selection was great. Most of all, the staffs are attentive, especially Viknesh.
He was friendly and provided good service. From what we observed, the other guests were also very comfortable with the service provided by him and his team.
4
Snapper Pie was good... The Hot & Cold Platters were some experience. Overall....service and staff were very friendly and responsive to your request.
5
We tried the hamburger and the clam liguini and were very happy they were well cooked. Service staff, viknesh was also very attentive, efficient and helpful. Chill environment.
4
Sat here for a drink after long day walking the city.
The waiter was very attentive and the music/dj was really great.
In the end we sat for almost 3 hours and there was nothing to dislike except the prices...but this is Singapore :)
3
It was a cool evening (for Singapore, only 28c) and we elected to sit outside to be in the shadow of the imposing Marina Bay Sands (zzzz). I think we should have sat inside as the restaurant looked quite comfortable however outside the table was not quite big enough for four to eat comfortably. The chairs are Ikea metal stools. Food was good but for service... I felt like apologising to the waiting staff that we were interrupting her life. This aside we made the best of it and next time when visiting One Fullerton, we will try an alternative eatery
4
Beautiful setting and stunning views of the bay. We ordered the Pelican Seafood Platter. Seafood quality was great except for the muscles which were very small. Says serves 2-3 but really it feeds 2. I wish I didn't have to complain but I was asked twice if I was using a voucher or discount offer before I even looked at the menu. Then a third time after I ordered the seafood platter. The waiter seemed to assume I was not able to afford the full prices and wanted to ensure I was made very aware that the platter was not on any discount offers. Very disappointing. One would hope waiters would know better and not make assumptions. I was left fuming and had they proceeded to remind a 4th time I was ready to demand a conversation with the manager. They redeemed themselves marginally via their friendliness for the rest of the evening
4
First time to this restaurant overlooking MBS if you are sitting out doors. The day we visited they had a board advertising their 1 for 1 happy hour till 8pm. Service I found very good and even for the long wait between the starter and main they kept us informed of what was happening which I think is good. For the main I ordered the Baramundi and my partner the the snapper pie which where both tender and well cooked. Prices are a little on the expensive side but given the location it is understandable. I would go back again for seafood. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant.

Had great expectations for the Snapper Pie, but it turned out bland, although portions were huge. The creamy sauce drowned out the taste of everything else. At $40, it was truly disappointing. The dish lacked oomph, and wasn't salted to taste...The Glacier 51 Toothfish was surprisingly tasty and crusty. Portions for this one was reasonable, although there wasn't any substantial sides to go with for this dish.We also ordered the Creamed Spinach with Blue Cheese ... a dish that had been recommended in many reviews.It didn't produce any fireworks,as far as creamed spinach goes. Mortons has better creamed spinach... without the blue cheese variety.All in all, the meal was overpriced for the quality produced. The fish was fresh, but there are many places serving good, fresh fish without this price tag, but more flavoursome and memorable.

We regularly go to Pelican for lunch because the food is normally excellent but with mediocre service. On Thursday the service was the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore, the staff were extremely self occupied (2 tables eating and 5 staff but no one to serve us) and when the servers did attend they were rude and argumentative. We as a company will not go back again (which is a shame for the chefs as the food is really some of the best in Singapore).

Good location with indoor and outdoor dining. The ambiance is perfect for a quite evening dinner either be with your loved ones or with your friends... and this time I'm with my friends. Attentive, very helpful with menu recommendations by the servers made our dining experience unforgettable.The food were amazing; loved the presentation. Efficient service. Food bit costly but then at the end of the meal you won't feel bad in paying a higher price for the overall exp.

This was a great experience. A very amazing place to go into nye. We had the 6 courses. And it qas just exactly the right tempo where the kept serving us the food. Delicious food.
5
Had a wonderful lunch with my family. The staff were friendly and has smiles on their face all the time. The oyster were fresh and succulent. Snapper pie still as awesome. Fried squid just divine.
5
Excellent service render by the staff at Pelican. We had a wonderful anniversary dinner. Special thanks to Andi the Assistant Manager for the recommendation and great service.

I'm still sitting here as I write this review. The couple at the table next to me have been waving madly to get the attention of the 4 waiters, with no success. It's been 20 mins and I still can't get the bill. One waiter focussed solely on clearing glasses, the other talks only to customers he's friends with. Disgraceful. Not Singaporean hospitality at all. Food is overpriced, even for Singapore and this location. Won't be returning
5
We did the 6 course NYE dinner followed by ringing in the new year with the fireworks out on the deck. What a fantastic experience! Both the food and service was amazing, and even now my wife and I debate over what our favorite dish was (both the house cured fish and crab cakes were top choices). I would definitely recommend The Pelican for any special occasion
5
Ordered crab cakes starter & cornbread pudding as side., with mussel linguine and tooth fish as mains. All tasted good but crab cake was simply divine. Highly recommended. But was truly outstanding was their genuine and unobtrusive service rendered throughout the dinner. Every wait staff was patient and helpful, ready to assist. They checked on you every 10min- from pouring water and asking you on the dishes served and feedback if we want to highlight. Thumbs up

We enjoy the seafood and lobster platter tower. The oyster was good.The evening setting by the river water side with the marinas Bay view setting and MBS ambience was great to enjoy the dinner.The bad haze days just cleared for our dinner.Food was price

The Pelican is well positioned on the waterfront of Marina Bay, but the outdoor section is predominately used by smokers and even the few non-smoking tables will be affected by cigarette smoke. Food and drinks are average and relatively expensive for what you get, but you're paying for location

Hi pelican,A great experience for my first encountered recommended by my partner. We are local, and a staff named viknesh had delivered his astonishing customer service level. He tried to retained us for more beers however due to our daily errands we had to make a move. He kept us entertained and performed excellent service. He deserve a pat, keep it up! Singapore needs people like him. Appreciate the ambience and customer service level.Regards,Alvin

Please don't be put off by the slightly worn menus as the food is excellent. As is the service. Outside gives you a great view of the marina bay & laser show plus happy hour is all night!

Their service is very good and the snapper pie is very nice. I will go back with my wife again next time.
3
Nice restaurant on great location. Food is not amazing, but for a nice evening out it is a nice place to go!
4
Went with friends and shared a seafood platter for 6 people which contained lobster, crab, oysters, clams, mussels.
3
Ordered the Pelican Platter. I am a sucker for oysters but that, and the crab were a disappointment.
5
We had the Pelican Platter and a couple of entrees. The food quality is very good, fresh and well served. They also have a nice wine variety. If the weather suits you, the outside tables are worth it as it is a spectacular view of Marina Bay.

8 of us went for two birthday celebrations, including my sisters 50th. Guru looked after us all evening and was very patient and helpful. Our food was lovely, I had the Pelican Burger with Bay Fries which was delicious, and cooked to order a la American style which was great. Happy hour now runs to 11.00pm each night, set selection of beers and spirits on buy one get one free. We would definitely recommend and go again. Thank you Guru for all your kindness

Was there a few time with my friends and had a great time.The server viknesh done a great job by helping us suggestion the food & drinks.i think viknesh is awesome guy.We will definitely be back & support him and the outlet.Thanks so much.Btw the oysters are great & the view!

We just felt like a light dinner and this setting was perfect. Outside table under cover. View of the water and Marina Bay Hotel. The food was fresh and service was good. We ordered wine by the glass and were pleasantly surprised by the choices. A must have is the broccoli with blue cheese sauce !!! Fish of the day was grilled to perfection. Recommend this establishment without hesitation.
5
Such an excellent place with exquisite food. Was served by Vicky. Brilliant guy. Took care of every detail meticulously. My girlfriend had a wonderful time and that is all that's matters. Two thumbs up!
5
Marina Bay with a wonderful view! Pleasant place, nice beer and oysters! We loved it!!!
Recommend. We came Saturday evening! Happy Hour from 12:00 to 8:00 pm
2
Not the place to go to for a business lunch. We waited more than an hour for food to arrive, and we had only orders of 2 different dishes for the whole table. Food was average at best. Service was.. what service??!
3
If you enjoy oysters, this seems to be the place to go. They have a very good oyster special on Tue and Thu, and pretty good drink specials almost daily. Atmosphere is nice and the place is packed most days. Unfortunately on the high end price wise ... so dont go there if on a budget
4
The food was superb but the downside is that the restaurant service crew were clueless on the promotion of "Fullerton Heritage". We have to show them the menu and after few attempts with manager coming out to assist. Other than that, all are nice, would recommend to others. 
3
I went there on my birthday and heard from my mum that they did promise a birthday cake which was forgotten.other than that, the restaurant service was okay. as we are eating seafood, there is alot of utensils on our table. When the service staff clear the table, they kept dropping the utensils.Not very attentive as well as they have to be reminded to bring me a spoon and to refill our ice water
4
I was late to make a reservation for my husband's birthday which coincide with Singapore's 50th Birthday but the manager was helpful enough to sort & allocate an indoor seat for me just a week before the celebration. The area was cordoned off to public which made the place comfortable to their guests. Food was kept within standard and served promptly despite the restaurant being full and we were attended promptly too. Manager also took an effort to introduce himself and remembers my special request pertaining to my seafood allergy. A very pleasant experience and looking forward to return soon

I was down the harbour front with some friends for the Friday evening fireworks and we walked past this place and decided to pop in. Although it was very busy they found us a spot. We ordered so drinks and I noted they have some great happy hour offers but we missed those. We ordered some nibbles type food and ordered scampi and plates of fries. Both were delicious and the scampi was superb.Service was okay. I read just now some of the other reviews and I'm surprised it was so bad for others. For us it was a great night and reasonable prices. I would return for sure

After a disappointing first visit decided to give Pelican another chance. Last time the service was appalling, this time so was the food...The fish pie had sauce that was so runny it was like water, with two tiny pieces of fish.My friends burger was stone cold. She sent it back. Only half of it was returned (it had been cut in half and only half was returned) - outrageous! And it had been warmed up in a microwave. Is that really what you should expect when paying $35 for a burger?!?She sent it back again and they cooked a fresh one. Unfortunately the other 4 of us had finished eating and she felt really uncomfortable.Avoid

As this is an expensive place, we expected something exceptional. We really were disappointed. It was too hot to sit outside so we couldn't even enjoy the view and after spending 120.00 on the 2 less expensive dishes on the menu, we went to a neerby caffe to get some food in us as we felt everything but full.My wife ordered the Pelican Burger "medium" which came completely raw. We decided to switch plate so she wouldn't have to eat the expensive dish of raw meat, plain bread and Campbell tomato paste or go through the embarassing process of sending back food.I originally ordered a pan fried fish. It was not bigger than my two thumbs put together and quite tasteless. I shared the uncooked french fries with my wife as she was hungry after her 2 bites of fish and they sure looked at us weird when we asked for ketchup to accompany those raw potatos.The best part of the meal was the bread they brought as we were waiting for our meal. It smelled like old fish but thankfuly it tasted like regular bread.There are plenty of pretentious places to go in Singapore where you actually get decent food. That is not one of them. You should overpay at another restaurant. My two cents
5
Good place & Good music and yes thanks Viknesh for the awesome service.i will bring more of my friends from finland!!..& Food was alright.Hope to see more varietys.100/100.Thanks for the night!!
4
It's a very nice place to have a drink or some bar snacks and watch the light show across at the Marina Bay Sands. The chicken dish is really good, the others were okay, but not knock outs.
5
Well, I love the place, if you like an outdoor seating it offer a nice view especially at night overlooking the MBS.Not so much of the oyster that we ordered. My highlight have to be the Roasted Patagonian Toothfish which was recommended by an experience Trainee called Jamie who really took care of us very well.The dish was absolutely delicious, the fish was so soft, fluffy and tender, the brioche Crust add the crunchy taste.I may say it's one of the best udah fish I ever had.We also like to have Aidil who also took care of us during the dinne

I read a review on this awhile back & have been meaning to try this place as I am a seafood lover. I happen to be nearby & dropped for a quick dinner before my show at Victoria Theatre. We ordered 2 pints of HH beers which was 1-4-1, I think, 8 oysters & the recommended pie to share. It must have been recommended to anyone who is unsure of what to have. On the left & right of me were people who ordered the pie. The wait was 20min & that was told to us before hand. We didn't wait longer than that. Food was ok. Oysters small but fresh. The pie was a dish filled with snapper fish, mushrooms & a bit of asparagus. This was then topped with filo pastry which was baked till nice & brown.o felt the pastry could have been fluffier... It was a little dense. The fish I didn't agree with. I could tell it was frozen. perhaps I am used to having fresh fish. The bill came $140+. Shocking? Well it was a little. The rip off was the oysters which was half the bill. I had better oysters at Pasarbella or Culinary for lesser. Definitely not coming again.
5
Had a great night on Friday with a group of clients.Viknesh has done a great job even though we had trouble him a lot but he put a smile on his face.Great Service & Place.Pricing was good.Will be back again with friends & clients.All I can he done a great job thanks a lot -Steve
5
Staff was awesome! We went inside to get market oysters and beers. Still gave us the discount on beers that they advertise outside. Very knowledgable staff about the area as well! Enjoyed it and is a great pit stop from the amazing scenery in the Marina. Happy hour $2 oysters as well!!!
4
Third visit here and we will be back. Location is going to drive high prices, so put all of that to one side during this review. Every visit we have always had great service. This week when we went we were a little nervous as we had a trainee. We need not be worried, she was fab. Food is incredibly tasty, we love the crab cakes as they truly are homemade and the chowder is rich and tasty. This is a place that we will visit for a treat. Well worth it.
5
Patronize the place for the 2nd time yesterday with friends for drinks and it was a good choice as I met my favorite server again. It was a busy evening however Izad and team did well on delivering drinks and our food on time. Never a let down and never worry about food as oyster was great! Both service and food was excellent. Great cocktail recommendation. Definitely will bring my friends here again. Thanks again Izad and team for the wonderful evening!! Sure to see you all again!!!

We sat outside on the promenade for lunch. Beer and wine were on happy hour. For starters we had fish cakes and chowder, both very tasty. Mains were tuna steaks and pelican burgers. Both very tasty. Price was ok for the location and the staff were attentive nearly all of the time. This is my second visit and i have enjoyed each one. I will be returning in the futur

We were staying at the One Fullerton Hotel and we took a walk by the Fullerton bay.Happen to see a Bar & a waiter was offering us to eat & drink.So we decided to Have drinks & dinner. Brilliant food Great Service and a really enjoyable experience ! Oh and what a view !! The staff were top draw especially Viknesh who made our evening especially good !! Great Value would recommend to all !!

Friday night, very busy. Waitresses at our service just fine, just like we were the only one there. Food so so and pricey.
5
A cold beer with this fantastic view. Take a seat, and have a conservation with the table next to you. And the people who work there, amazing. I will say, dont pass The Pelican.
1
This restaurant is in a great location. You can sit inside or out and the food is fine. However, at the end of the meal we paid our bill which included service charge (of course). When I went to pay it, the water towered over us and said "aren't you going to pay for my service". I said that I thought this was in the service charge but he told me it all went to the company and staff get nothing. Therefore, he told us, we needed to give him more money as a service charge. Presumably 12.5% on top of the bill + Service. We paid and left.Our hotel - Mandarin Oriental - was excellent but totally shocked. This is likely illegal behaviour and something the Government would be very upset about. Ripping off tourists is not something they encourage. The hotel insisted the manager of the Pelican call me in my room. After 15 mins of him speaking at me I got the strong impression he felt this was just something he could talk his way out of.The hotel is confident that intimidation like this - and we were definitely intimidated - is not something we should have gone through. It ruined our night and my children still ask if Singapore is the one where the waiter mugged us. BEWARE
4
I stopped in here during happy hour (Buy One Get One). Had it not been for that discount I would have found it incredibly expensive for a 'house' wine. The service was a little slow, but always very friendly. What makes this place worth going to is, obviously, the view. It was a quiet and relaxing. Perfect little stop from a long day of walking and taking in the sights
1
Possibly the worse service I have experienced in Singapore over 11 yearsFood was tasteless my colleagues didn't receive any veges with main courseTook over 15 minutes to get a drinkVery disappointingWe had our big boss from HQ restaurant was chosen by others and I think if it is linked to Fullerton group it must be at least ok. But I was wrong I had a tuna steak as I wanted the Seabass but not available when I asked was there any other seafood I was told no better have a steak. Funny for a seafood restaurant to only have one fish.The restaurant should have major overhaulI will not becoming bac

We arrived in Singapore after a long journey from Sweden and asked the hotel we lived in to recommend a good seafood restaurant. Unfortunately, the restaurant they recommended was fully booked. A couple of doors nest to the recommended restaurant we came across The pelican Seafood bar and grill and decided to have a meal here. The waiters were very kind and helpful, the service was good. The food was average. Two of us decided to have beer and two of us decided to have a glass of wine each. The waiter subtly suggested that the four of us could share a bottle of wine and that he could recommend some good wines to go with the food. The waiter came with the bottles to the table and we did not get a wine list. We decided on a Carnival of Love Shiraz 2013. When the bill arrived the wine costed 190 Euros. hen we questioned this cost we were told that it was correct. When we protested and asked to see the wine list, we were informed that this wine was not on their list. Very poor indeed
3
Nice location and outlook ... but $14 for a Corona??? A very small serving of chips was $12 and 3 small (albeit tasty) sliders were $28. I get that you pay a premium for certain locations but this place takes their pricing a little too far
3
Pleasantly situated at One Fullerton with a beautiful view of the Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant gets top marks for deco and view. I was there for lunch but I can certainly imagine - what a romantic place it will be for dinner. There is indoor air-conditioning or out door alfresco seating.Food was really so so. I had the Beef Burger (S$35) for lunch. It was good but I think a bit over priced for S$35. The average price for a main meal would be about $35. Ranges to $100 if you were into lobsters, oysters etc. The place really advertises itself as a French Seafood restaurant - so perhaps my choice was not too correct. I saw the wine list and it was quire good. You get a decent bottle for about S$80 which is better in comparison to the food
4
The Pelican has a great location, overlooking the Marina Bay. The bar is quite up to par with the location, offering some special cocktails and some with a twist on the classics.Service generally is friendly, but can be slow at times. We also had very good unsolicited recommendations from them.Be prepared, though, to pay the price for location and quality: Cocktails will set you back around S$ 23 (incl.). There is a 141 happy hour deal on beer available.To sum it up: we've been there several times and will be back.(Reviewed as a bar only.
5
Excellent views, service and food are true to this spot on the water in Singapore. Most say that the afternoons in Singapore are too hot, but with a cool breeze off the water and two for one happy hour drinks, the heat will be the last thing on your mind.I had the scallops which were on the starter menu, but an excellent size for lunch. The selection of beers and liquors in the happy hour menu will be familiar to any westerner. The service is fast and friendly and makes you feel welcome in an instant. With many helpful ideas about things to do in Singapore, they won't leave you lacking for things to see around the city.Don't skip this spot when visiting Singapore!-Mathe

A great place to Chill with my friends from overseas.Viknesh never fail to give his Best Service when i m around n bringen other guests.This makes me to come more offen.Thanks will be dropping by again.U will achieve ur dreams.

Epic venue. Great music. Great service. Recommend stopping by to see the light show. Waiter was best service.We have had in long night.Thanks Viknesh.My support is there for u Buddy!!Cheers!

The restaurant has a good ambience and good view of Singapore river. The food taste great and seafood is really fresh. Just that the price is on the high side...the service is good, staffs are friendly.
5
Waiting time is a little long but the servers are helpful and friendly. The salad is not worth the price but the tuna steak is definitely a must-try. Great view and good ambience too.

Great music, services concept to a higher level, great view!
Free advise on how to navigate around wonderful Singapore.

Viknesh made our night! What absolutely brilliant service - it was like dining in a friend's home, we felt that welcome! Brilliant views, great atmosphere and lovely food. Thanks Viknesh! -Janelle and Cole

The service has been absolutely terrible. We have been waiting almost 1 hour to get served the starters (and restaurant almost empty) and we have been served almost 3 times the neighbor's orders.You will pay the same price (30+ per main course) as very nice restaurant near by so definitely not worth it
5
Amazing view located just opposite Marina Bay Sand. Nice ambience with a very attentive service crew. Good food but waiting time for food was slightly longer. However food was worth waiting for. Had lobster and snapper a must to try dishes recommended by the helpful server Izad. Server is very knowledgeable of the menu and even though there was no set menu he managed to mix and match our course from starter to mains and deserts. Nothing to complain from food to service is perfect. You won't be disappointed just look for the service crew Izad. He will explain everything on the menu. 10/1

Really depends what you're looking for. If you have out of town friends that want to have a drink with a good view, the al fresco area overlooking the bay is wonderful. If you're looking for the best snapper pie in Singapore, this is it, hands down! But if you're seeking value for money oysters or fresh seafood platters, then there's other places that fit that better. Overall, decent date place
5
Viknesh is very good and energized person! Ask him for beer and he make your evening unforgettable :-)
Good place!!!...Barvo!!!..Barvo!!
Come and you will have no regrets!

We had a blast.Viknesh kept the beer flowing and cracked jokes that were very unique. Candy Bacon is awesome and it has added to the list of great bacon experiences. BTW the view is pretty cool

Good Place and Nice food

Thanks to Dee and Viknesh

My family and I enjoyed the oysters, crab brioche, lobster thermidor, baked snapper pie and seafood pasta.. Tried all the 4 in house specialities and the above 3 were really memorable.
5
Spent the afternoon at Pelican whilst on a trip to Singapore attending a conference. Viknesh was great, recommending the best food to eat and the best drinks to order. He was spot on. The view sitting outside offered the best that Singapore has to offer. Highly recommended restaurant and bar.
5
Came here on a Wednesday.Door Host Diana gave me a great place to chill out.Looking pretty Though!!!...Keep it up.Drinks on the Happy Hour is worth it!!..But should have more varietys of Beers.Like maybe a local TIGER?...beside that staff viknesh was good in entertaining me in places to visits and sharing his experinces in sg..KEEP the GOOD work going up Diana and Viknesh!

The restaurant is situated at One Fullerton just opposite the historic Fullerton Hotel, and is right by the waterfront. I expect the view of the bay in the evening will be excellent for drinks and finger food; we went at lunch and sat inside as balmy Singapore was a little bit too hot and humid that day.We were celebrating an occasion, and on recommendation of a friend we ordered the Pelican Platter, which promised to be a tower of plump and lovely seafood that feeds 2-3 people (as estimated in their menu). Our friendly waitress warned us not to be surprised by the large amount of food that would be served, so our expectations were raised even further. When the food arrived, we tucked in. The shellfish was relatively fresh, though the portions were quite overstated. What we got was 6 oysters, 6 prawns, one middle-sized crab, a small lobster, and a handful of mussels and clams - hardly a mountain of food by most standards. We certainly expected more for SGD163, and went in search of more food right after.We may return to sample other items on their menu, but we will stay away from the platter
5
Happy Hour it was a Good Deal.Great View Great Food!!.Viknesh was a good waiter and have good customer service and Smile.C u soon
4
Service was very good -Vikie is the man and he has been taking care of us for some time. The bar and dining ambiance is also good. Only had drinks on this occasion but intending of dining soon and will review again
5
waitress recommended the oysters and we were not disappointed by the freshness. had the baked fish and it was again fresh and delicious. the beef was simply seasoned with sea salt and brought out the flavours of the meat. service was well attentive and knowledgeable.
1
Wish I had read the reviews below before going to this restaurant. Nice location, OK food, very poor service from beginning to end. The restaurant was nearly empty so it wasn't as if they were busy. Including having to wait for the bill for 20 mins plus- despite chasing several times
5
We had a fabulous experience at this restaurant! We were able to reserve a table for 12 riverside to view the laser show at marina bay sands. The food was excellent, everyone enjoyed their meal and remarked how good each meal was. The service was brilliant as we were celebrating a milestone birthday. The staff took very effort to make this a fantastic night out for all. One of their great staff even went the absolute extra mile making sure we saw the full 360 view of singapore.. It was a night to remember....
5
Great location to chill and away from the bustling of the crowd, perfect ambience to catch up on things with friends. With the awesome service provided, what more can you ask for? Adam, will always give a personalized service whenever me and my friends came by. He will constantly check on our table to see if there is anything that is lacking. And the rest of his crew are always full of smiles and I would highly recommend the 'Crab cakes' if you intend to nibble on some snacks while having a couple of drinks. As a whole, The Pelican is highly recommended if you intend to relax with your loved ones after a hard day's wor
5
We found this bar on the Marina Bay after four days in Singapore. Wish we'd found it earlier great views and light show at 8pm and 9pm. Viknesh is the Concierge and an amazing guy he arranged other things for us to do and even made reservations at no cost a great guy who is extremely well connected without being superior about it. Definitely go!..GREAT TEAM!!!...Check out this place!!
5
We wanted to try this restaurant after we heard how personalized their service is from our friends and colleagues. Upon seating, a cheerful and sweet waitress made us feel welcomed and felt like VIP. That's what i mean by personalized service as they can make you feel so valued and appreciated. We were given full descriptions on all the items that we enquire.So this is what we ordered :Oyster ( Fresh Juicy Succulent Umami)Crab Toast (The taste is soo WoW!!)Crab cakes (Its a sin to miss this. Confirm)Daily Catch of the day (The SURPRISE that you MUST order)Blue Cheese Creamed Spinach (I never thought this was possible but it is. and its damn good)And finally.. The Whoopie pie... ( You will never taste chocolate as good as this.)Drinks:Pelican (A perfect drink for the dinner. I ordered 4 glasses!!)Pina Swizzle (My fiancee is starting to love pineapple because of this)All and all, My dinner date was excellent. Thanks to The Perfect Pelican Team

Had light bites and drinks on Friday night with my friends from Australia. A good place to chill out with friends as the view is great. The ambience is fantastic with dj playing songs that suits the mood. Service is the best as server is attentive and friendly. One particular waiter Ezard never fails to make us laugh and makes us feel comfortable with his friendliness. Eventhough he is a trainee but he really knows how to serve with professionalism. Price for drinks are acceptable but can do better on the fries quantity. Too little fries is served if not can give 5 stars. Recommended to visit the place and should look for Ezard to serve you for the amazing experience
3
We stayed at the bay terrace. A bit overpriced, but its worth the view. Staff was very friendly, but coffes arrived one by one, one of them came after the food, although we ordered them before we even looked at the food menu and requested them as soon as possible.
5
A great location and great food. Outdoor dining facing Marina Bay Sands marvellous. Great Chef and great service. Very friendly and prompt service by Viknesh. I loved being there.
5
Had a great time in this restaurant nice food,great service rendered by one server namely Sahfizad. Should look for him next time if were to visit the place again. Really makes us feel at home. Amazing experience with amazing hospitality eventhough price abit steep. Nice ambience great view. Sahfizad will tell you a great story of the restaurant. Kudos to the server!!!
5
Very friendly atmosphere and affordable drinks during Happy Hour thanks to Varknesh who acted as photographer as well as waiter. When 2 of our nearly finished drinks were mistakenly removed during getting photos taken he quickly replace all of them even though he certainly didn't have to......I made sure I have a few drinks there with my family on every visit to Singapore and watch the sunset over a Marina Ba
4
Seafood platter was good, the oysters were plump and succulent, and the staff were attentive, although they forgot one of our orders. Downside - ask about the size of the portions beforehand - some are large and meant for sharing, and some would form half a meal for a child. We had the crab brioche toast, which was essentially one piece of brioche cut up into 8 pieces, and paid $18 for it. Have the cornbread pudding - not cheap at $12, but delicious.Best to go in a group - the portions mostly meant for sharing and priced accordingly. Some review below complained about being given only ketchup as a dip for the seafood - clearly they don't know the difference between ketchup and a rather nice marinara/tomato sauce
3
I made my reservation through Chope and was given a "not so good table" but luckily it is at the corner on the lower level. The girl who greeted us has a trainee badge on her and I do not even understand how a top restaurant can put someone so inexperience at the front. The second encounter with her was even worse. She took our order and after ordering soup she asked us if "that was all". When another waitress came by with cups, she just walked away. So we had to repeat our order of our soup with the rest of the food which we had no chance to order with the trainee. When soup was served, there was no soup spoon. And the most interesting and hilarious fact is that they serve seafood on ice with a tomato ketchup dip. Maybe seafood was not their best forte...hmm. We ordered a bottle of wine and the whole time round we had to refill our glasses ourselves and 3-4 waitresses and waiters were just standing around and staring into space. I must say the saving grace from such atrocious service is the kind manager who brought us our wine, a cute waitress who took our order the 2nd time and the really fresh seafood. When we moved outdoors, service was so much better... at least the waiter in charge constantly came over to asked us if we wanted more alcohol or water. Ambience and deco was nice but I will not again pay $$$ for such lousy service

Totally In attentive staffWho even on being told the service was bad did not up their gameSome tables for four on the lower level leave two staring at a wallWhile the top tier tables in the booth are fixed and leave little room to moveNot a great night at all for the prices being aske

We were suggested this restaurant by our hotel, Goodwood Park and when we arrived they had reserved a front table so we could see the light show. Our waitress was a young trainee but very attentive with both the drinks and meals service. Great restaurant to see the light show from, if there was one disappointment it was that my wife been a non smoker found it a little stuffing in this smoking section even though it was outside as I did request a smoking section. Food a little expensive, but what the heck, we enjoyed it
3
We did the Marina walk and decided to rest our feet somewhere to wait for a laser show. Happy hour runs to 8 pm and is a one-for-one. That means that I got away with paying 17 SGD for two Kronenbourg 1964. We met three or four staff, all of them trainees. Service was ok, a bit more nonchalant than the other restaurants we've been to in SE-asia and not as expected for a place in this price range.This place has good tables for relaxing with a drink or two (hurrah for happy hour). Recommended for that purpose

Great views, good food and good service. The cost of a meal is high but the food is good. I had a steak and it was the best one i have eaten to date. I have extremely high standards when it comes to meat and Singapore is not well rated for its meat and ability to cook a good steak but this was unexpectedly good
2
Went to the Pelican tonight and can only say that we were totally underwhelmed. Location is awesome but after ordering drinks we were advised that half the menu was not available. The admittedly trainee waitress did her best to explain but with a reservation from a few days in advance why were we not advised of an apparent equipment failure?Anyway, drink service, to call it amateur is being generous. One could not open a bottle of wine. Food pretty much just bad. We ordered crab cakes - good, candied bacon - a mistake and admittedly ours, followed by boulebaisse for two which despite good seafood was absolutely tasteless and a burger for our daughter which they should be embarrassed to charge what they do. We do better at home with a cold storage patty.Anyway after blowing $550 I can only suggest going there for a drink and eating elsewhere. Only positive it was my wife's birthday and she enjoyed, but she was half stung

Fantastic views over the river, the merlion and the new hotel from this restaurant and bar. I Recommend the lemon meringue mess for dessert - it's delicious.

Unfortunately it was a typically touristic place.. The food was nothing special, small portions, and for thi to high prices. Take another restaurant..
5
Due to its Prime position at One Fullerton, we often come here for corporate lunches, though the lovely view is also well worth showing visitors. The gorgeous view of Marina bay can be enjoyed from the terrace, along with a hearty seafood lunch- my brioche crab toast was excellent. To drink, I tried the signature cocktail, The Pelican, which was delicious, had it not been a work lunch, I would have had several more

The Pelican Seafood Bar & Grill serves classic east coast American cuisine with a focus on fresh seafood and wood-fired grilling. We used The Entertainer voucher for a 1-for-1 main course which we had the ribeye steak as well as unlimited Belvedere cocktails. Ribeye Cap Steak ($58) - I quite like the texture of it - juicy and tender. The steak itself tasted great even without any condiments. Skate Wing Chop ($36) - with burn lemon butter. It tasted more like the angmoh style of our usual sambal stingray. Fresh and soft meat, accompanied with crispy fries. Double Atlantic Linguini & Clams ($58) - with chili flakes, garlic and white wine. Double says all which also means double the portion. $58 for double pasta may seems like a rip-off. But I'm impressed at the generous servings of clams, it's more than the pasta. Overall, it's decent but certainly satisfying.full review: http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/08/the-pelican-seafood-bar-grill-unlimited.htmlWe were attended by the manager most of the time and thank you for the great service. We dined outdoor during the National's Day Parade full dress rehearsal last week, our stunning table view was facing the exact spot for fireworks. Overall, my dining experience at The Pelican was such a joy especially spending it w great company. Special thanks to The Entertainer

invited for a team lunch my expectations were high as I thought it belongs to the Fullerton Hotel. Anyway. I found the lady at the entrance (Sheri) quite rude and arrogant. No smile and when asking for something she was very cool. The rest of staff friendly but somehow maybe to young and unexperienced or untrained otherwise I can√Ç¬¥t understand why they missed to bring enough glasses and cutlery to our table. When asking for a dessert to share they also did not bring any additional plates or spoons. Even for the side dish we needed to ask for spoons.The Food was okay but not something that stands out given the heavy competition in Singapore with regards to restaurants.I have no plans to visit this Restaurant again
3
The location is great, the food is good, but not special and the portions are small, and the prices on the high end ( of course you pay for the location ). They do have happy hour with 1 for 1 drinks. The music was a bit loud, I had a hard time hearing my company, maybe also due me being tired because of jetlag
4
It is not often that restaurants in Singapore produce a pie ( and a fish pie at that) with a nice flaky crust and just the right baking time for a fish dish.Sufficient for 2 and at $38/- this is all you would need if you had ordered a starter and the bisque is what I suggest.To add to the reward a member of my family had just celebrated a birthday and the restaurant showered us with a free bottle of Moet & Chandon ...!!! Where would you find this great deal in Singapore ? Its address at 1, Fullerton would be sufficient to have this bottle listed at a higher price but the menu had it at $130/- which I found extremely reasonable ( if I had to pay for it !!)A good wine selection , good views, reasonable prices ( by Singapore standards) and friendly and helpful staff...I would highly recommend this establishment ..
3
Sat outside on the terrace for a couple of drinks at happy hour. Pleasant atmosphere and if you are in the area (strolling around the waterfront) then stopping here for a couple would be nice.Not worth a special trip just to place, though. If I was in the area again, I'd go back
2
we had tomato soup which was a bit too sour and it was a small portion.they served bread with some taset and smell of seafood. a bit off putting.we had fried calamari, but it came with a weird coating. not the usual flour but something a bit more airy and oily.I could see this as a hangout bar for drinks but you need the food too. sorry but I'm not a fan
3
We had a very good view of Spore from where we sat. The laser lights came out and brighten up the place. Good place to bring frens who had not been to Singapore to witness the laser lights from the Marina Bay Sands.Food perspective it was average, the dishes were too salty for many of us. The steak was not up to par and was chewy. The soup portion was very small thou the plate was big.However, the starters were pretty good.Overall, we still enjoyed ourselves
4
The staff provided superb service! Especially Sheri and Eric. Thank you for taking great care of us at dinner. The interior design is cool and comfortably dim. Do try the candied bacon when you are there!
5
A great bar & restaurant i can say. Nice bar lay out.. food are awesome & prices are worth to pay for a great food. Happy hour deals are awesome and great selections to choose from too.. Godd food, drinks and awesome ambience....
5
Good outdoor seating area for a relaxing night out. The drinks are made well and the view at night of the Marina Bay skyline is also great!
5
A nice chill out place to drink and unwind great service great drinks and great snacks.. Everything here is just great.. And will be back again for sure...!
5
Had a birthday celebration when I was there and was taken care by the staff like I was king for the day... Did I mention the food was awesome!!!
4
The 3 of us ate here and chose 2 starters to share and 2 main courses with a dessert each. Cost around ¬£40 per head. Portions could have been a little larger!! Friendly staff.

Every month we've a team lunch. Hence we're constantly searching for reputable good restaurant to try. This month May we choose The Pelican. We ordered their Seafood Platter (SGD 128), 2 appetizer (Fried Calamari and Crab Cake) and 1 Tuna Fish for the table. Crab cake was delicious with a very tasty sauce. Seafood platter is decent for the price tag. Love the fresh oysters - they were big and fresh. Never ordered a Tuna fish as main course, when it came, we were pleasantly surprise for being very tender!Dessert we ordered Chocolate Pie and Pina Colada ice cream. Both presentation look so pretty! They were very tasty too! Pina Colada ice cream is so refreshing, we gobble both dessert within a minute?The Pelican didn't get full rating as I feel their staff need to go for more training. I wanted to order a bottle of Pinor Grigio and the waiter told me it was sold out. I asked him for recommendation, he went away and came back telling me a Sauv Blanc and Riesling which I told him I don't like them. What about any good Chardonnay? He went away again to ask his bartender and back with another unsure answer. We have to signal a few times to get the waitress attention along the way as they look everywhere just not at the table (the usual service you get in most restaurants in Singapore). However, since The Pelican comes with a more expensive price tag, I expect the staff to be more attentive, proactive and knowledgable
1
A revamped Pelican, in the past one of my favourite restaurants, is now ridiculously over-priced with fairly rude waiters. On arrival, alarm bells should have rung as it was the only place with vacant tables. I ordered a pint of draught Kronenburg and received a half pint. When questioned, the waiter responded that they only do half pints which are $12 each, so a pint is $24. To my amazement the waiter said "you come to Singapore, that's what you pay"......I let him know Ive lived here for 3 years and I could get a point for half that on Boat Quay.The food was good, but $38 for a fish burger is ridiculous. We wont be going bac

We wanted to see the Marina Bay light show and having purchased The Entertainer voucher book we found that The Pelican was in the book and opposite Marina Bay Sands so we booked for a Saturday night. We had a table outside and the view over the bay is lovely. We had no problem using our voucher and we even managed to hit happy hour. My criticism would be the level if he music being played - very loud - but we are in our fifties and maybe younger people don't mind but it was pretty deafening even in the open air and it would have been nice if they had turned it off for the light show but I suspect not many were interested in the show which I think is a nightly event.The service was excellent and the food was pretty good. We all had fish and it was perfectly cooked, particularly the tuna. My daughter had the fish burger which she did say was a bit odd but that was because she misunderstood the description of the specials and morphed two dishes into one! You need to order the vegetables separately but they were delicious, particularly the broccoli which was perfectly cooked and although the dish of spinach and blue cheese sounds odd it was very tasty and the cheese did not overwhelm the spinach. All in all we had a great evening in a great part if town

Compelled to review this place as it's such a disappointment. It used to be a great restaurant with great staff and great food. It changed to a restricted, overpriced menu with terrible night club music and as much atmosphere as Mars.I questioned why I couldn't get a pint of beer and they informed me, not only do they not have pint glasses, but the half pints cost $12......"you come to Singapore, that's what you pay" was the answer. Well Mr Rude waiter with your mobile phone plugged into your ear, I've lived here for 3 years and I can go to the restaurant next door and pay half that.....so that's what I'll do next time.I've been here an hour and my overpriced food has not yet arrived. I don't hold out much hope
1
The lack of service mentioned below was for real. Had to be the worst service we've ever experienced. Staff was unwelcoming...basically if you don't have the right look.....you will be ignored.

Lovely dinner. The baby snapper pie was huge and very tasty. The staff were very efficient and good service. Quite pricey though so dont forget your wallet!
5
Had an unplanned stop for drinks and appetizers on a gorgeous saturday afternoon. Excellent selection of light bites and beer/wine. Perfect location for enjoying views of the marina and people watching. The bacon was amazing (with ginger and lime), as well as the fries.

I droppend in for a quick lunch as I was strolling the Bay area in the heat ! Did not expect much as I had never heard of the place but they did surprise me big time with the food ! I usually don¬¥t expect much so early in the day and I don¬¥t crave something so fancy either ! But at the Pelican Seafood Bar and Grill ! It was like on a perfect night there ! Great Food and great service ! Thanks

Went here a couple of nights as we really enjoyed the scenic location, good ambience and chilled music played by the in-house dj. The cocktails were delicious and enjoyed some tasty crispy whitebait as a snack to accompany our drinks. Some of the food orders going out to other tables also looked delicious and were well presented. The service was good and the staff very friendly.You can sit inside or outside and enjoy stunning views across Marina Bay, and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel light show
3
Its only the location - Bang right on the Fullerton Bay! We booked a table outside on the promenade, everything was perfect, the cool breeze, the Singapore skyline across the bay, the laser show on the Marina bay sands...and then came the spoilers - 45 mins wait to get our first order of starters and drinks! Like seriously they were brewing it?? The next order was for a sea-food platter which again seemed they went fishing at the very hours! Food is average..you might want to dine here only if you want to enjoy the laser show sipping on your beer
2
We were wondering if the service....or lack of service was for real. Had to be the worst service we've ever experienced. Staff was unwelcoming...We politely asked if there was any bread as an appetizer and they proceeded to get a supervising staff member who looked at us as if we were crazy for asking. We were told they had none (though crab foccacia was on the menu) We ordered the foccacia and found it to be a few two-inch slices with a VERY thin layer of crab on top that was nearly tasteless. Can't even remember what else we had....it definitely wasn't noteworthy and overpriced for the experience. Almost had to get up to get attention for the check....We will not retur

A business lunch was nearly ruined by the inept service at this restaurant.Two courses ordered but the party almost left after the first course. Clam chowders were universally declared to be either bland or unpleasant. Mains took almost an hour to produce and by the time they arrived had to be rushed to allow us to return to work. Looking round the table it was clear that some food had been prepared then left for a long period and then refired. My own main course was one of them and was at best average.No less than 4 enquiries were made about timing of the arrival of our main courses, to which indifferent responses were given.Service was simply appalling. Either staff were having a bad day, badly trained or just did not care. However, at a place that charges S$30+ for main courses, this type of service is not only unacceptable but laughable. This restaraunt will not survive if it service standards continue at this level
3
decided to have business lunch here, as its kind of near the bayfront / financial district.meal was alright - mackerel was good, mains were passable, dessert did not registerwaiter forgot one of our orders, embarrassing for everyone, and the wait for food was rather long, even harder to get service be it drinks or for getting the bill
3
Facing the marina bay sands and the outstanding view in the evening this seafood restaurant offers outdoor seating to enjoy the light show at 8 pm. The seafood is very average nothing specially bad but no proper cooking so you can choose among all the other restaurants offering the same view on the quay
4
Seafood so fresh that it is served on ice :) Great ambience and beautiful view of the Marina Bay Sands, the flyer. After two bottles of Veuve, head over to the Butter Factory and have a great time with the young ones!
5
great place for seafood and to chill by the singapore river. besides the seafood platter, the double chocolate whoopie pie is a must try. damn good but sinful. lol
4
Lunch set was delicious (but expensive - over $100 for two people). Portions seemed small at first, but I was actually quite full when I left. Service was quick, friendly, and relaxed. The interior is beautiful and the atmosphere was really good. I recommend the citrus iced tea.
3
I was so looking forward to a yummy seafood dinner but sadly the very poor service ruined our meal and any chances of us returning. Our waiter got my drink order wrong and actually forgot my main course so my friend ate her entire meal and then I got my main, unacceptable. We did alert the manager but no apology and all he did was not charge us for the meal, know acknowledgment of the waiters error. Best to just head to Luke's for same kind of food and better service. Such a pity because it's a lovely restaurant decor and yummy food.
2
Was so excited to eat here, but was very dissapointed.Restuarant was not full but the place was heavily understaffed.Is not a cheap restaurant, on the contrary on the pricier side and you expcect a certain kind of service.Ordered a vodka martini and after 30 mins it was not yet in our table, had to follow up 4 times from different servers before it arrived halfway into the meal.Asking for tabasco and condiments took 15 mins i was tempted to walk in the rstaurant and get it myself.Food was ok, not bad but not great either and the seafoofd especialy the lobster was soft and mushy. Obviously having been frozen and thawed. Everything else was mediocre. Not coming back
2
Visited Pelican for a weekday night out and was really disappointed with the limited food choices on the menu and the pricing is not worth the portion you are getting.My partner and I ordered a Tuna Steak and Seabass (the seabass with tasteless, i needed salt to add flavour). My partner's Tuna steak was simple but also needed a bit of taste to complete the dish. We highlight to the waiters and his response was seabass dish is one of our lightes taste dish on the menu.We also ordered cod tongue - the best dish out of the three however the 4 pieces delivered was of different size and portion. Hope the chef can standardize the portion as this is a great dish.No a place I would return to dine at anytime soon

I was staying at the Fullerton Bay hotel, so wandered down here for a casual dinner. The concierge advised me to just pick which ever of the restaurants I fancied! I sat outside, so a great view of the light show at the Marina Bay Sands. Service was quick and attentive.They have a happy hour between 6 and 8pm, which is very useful, as wine is very expensive in Singapore. They are quite happy to keep your second glass until 8.30pmFood is basically American style fish and steakI had the sea bass fillet and extra side of fries. It was beautifully cooked and just what I wanted.Great choice for a casual lunch or dinner. It wasn't cheap, but I have yest to find a good restaurant in Singapore that is
5
Our group of three had an amazing experience here during the F1 weekend. We had The Pelican Platter with chilled seafood platter (lobster, crab, mussels, clams, oysters, shrimp) and a bottle of prosecco. It was amaaazing. They are exactly right when they estimate that it serves 2-3 people. It served as a light dinner for three of us. We loved the night view of the bay, with the lights and buildings. Absolutely wonderful and breezy. Great service too
4
We has the pelican platter with lobster , crab , muscles , oysters, prawns and much more . Was 126 Singapore dollars. We had a side of spinach and blue cheesy 12sd and 5 carslburg special bucket of beers 35sd and a banana butter putting 14sd. The food was perfect , out of this world. The service was good maybe a little 2 attentive . The location is great for a view of the marina bay sands light show and the bat area. If money isn't a issue eat here . If it is , you won't regret it 
4
Only two matters keep me from rating this as "excellent" --- the prices are on the high (very high?) side and the music was way too loud. For example, barrimundi was the fish special when we went but the cost was the equivalent of US$63 which is completely ridiculous. To the waiter's credit when we asked that the insufferably loud music be turned down, he did it (and immediately). That being said, the food was delicious, our waiter was prompt, helpful and remarkably pleasant. Sitting outside (it was not especially hot or humid when we went) enabled us to enjoy the remarkable view of the river, the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and the fireworks (?) show a couple of times
2
Location is nice enough, service is good but the whole experience was mediocre.
To expensive and music to loud to make it a winner.
5
Seriously, try the burger with prawn toast bun. The cocktails were good too. Great views also and a good way to beat the heat.
3
We eat here only one night, expensive for the food we had. We had one starter between us for main we had baramunde fish, chips and one veg, one drink each and wine and a beer, cost approx ¬£100.00, defiantly over priced
2
If you like your reservation to be messed up, the lady at the front of house to effectively accuse you of lying, your food overpriced, your service varying from mediocre to poor, your starter to arrive with your main, Rick Astley being played 3 times at top whack along with the rest of Stock, Aitken and Warterman's back catalogue, then enjoy. We did not. The location is great just down from The Fullerton Bay hotel and across the road from The Fullerton Hotel and bang opposite the Marina Bay Sands so the view is good but that is about as good as it gets.
4
It was my first visit to the restaurant and read the reviews, and I kind of knew what to expect about the food and service. But I was blown away by the Fantastic food, service and ambience! Siti, who was our server was sooooo attentive to our needs, constantly checking with us if the food is to our palate etc...Eric who took my reservation was so professional and arranged for a surprise cake for my husband without me asking. Very very impressed with service and would highly recommend. Though presentation of food was not fancyful it looks kind of plain but not to your mouth. Every bite is worth it. Well, price wise it's between 60-80 per pax. Nice place to chill out too
3
Dining with a great view overlooking Marina Bay. Most people were dinning outside on a beautiful evening. but the food may not be worth it. though the presentation is high class butnin terms if taste - lets just say it is mediocre at best. However the service was great and attentive.
3
This is a restaurant that has a great view. We wandered in by chance and got a table outside. This was a really winner as we had a great view of the fireworks and laser show around 8pm from the Marina Sands and surrounding area. The prices are not cheap and the drinks, especially wine, are high even by Singapore standards. The menu was quite good for a bistro type like this place. The crab cakes were very nice, not cheap and a reasonably small serve; the chowder was excellent even though the serve was a little small. The hamburgers were cooked to perfection with nice sides. We did not really need to order extra fries. The service was good, informative and well-paced. I would recommend this place as the food was reasonable, the setting great and the light show excellent. It cost us $125AUD for three for an entr√É¬©e and a cheaper main each and a beer and a glass of wine for two
4
We had a birthday celebration and a thoroughly enjoyable evening. Can highly recommend the large Pelican platter with a full lobster, oysters etc etc at $ 128++ which is enough for 2-3 people. The DBL Linguini is also very good. The wines by Singapore standard are also reasonably priced f. inst. Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir at $110++ , and the staff did an excellent job
3
The restaurant is relatively new and strategically located along the Singapore prime tourist area where the iconic Merlion is only 5 minutes walk away and you could enjoy the sunset along the Singapore River with Marina Bay as the backdrop if you have a pre-dinner cocktail in their outdoor veranda. The menu is California /Long Island/American East Coast seafood style with very good menu for drinks - this is after all A Bar cum Grill. To enjoy a great dinner with a few drinks would cost about S$100 per head - not bad for a prime location in Singapore. There are a few menu item that is great for sharing: The Pelican Platter, The Linguini, The Baked Snapper...even the dessert should be shared if you are watching your BM
4
This place is supposed to be known for their seafood dishes, but what I really enjoyed the most was all of the desserts that we ordered! The bread and butter pudding, Pina Colada dessert and the Whoopie die were all sensational!For the main, I got the fish pie, which is very large - big enough for two people, but I found that the sauce didn't really merry with the fish. I felt like I was eating boiled fish, with some creamy sauce poured over top. Other than that, something thats great and interesting to order is the cod's tongue with the little fried bit. Delicious!I would say some of the dishes on the menu are very pricey, but the fish pie becomes quite reasonable if you share
4
Nice fish restaurant by the bay, helpful staff. After choosing my main course, the waiter pointed out that it was more of a starter than a main so suggested something else.
3
We had dinner here. We were shown a small snapper that could be cooked to share for $86. I think we would then have had to pay $12 for any side dishes. We decided on linguini with clams for $56 and shared this which was very pleasant with a nice glass of red. This restaurant is in a great location to view the mariner. At 8pm there was an impressive laser light show on the hotel complex across the marina that has the ship shaped building on top of it . I can't remember it's name. Service was efficient. Very much a place were you pay for location
5
I visited The Pelican as part of a 90-person conference for dinner one evening in April 2013. The whole evening was very good and I would not hesitate to recommend The Pelican. We had a limited menu, so the soup was provided and we had a choice in the entrees and mains. I chose the caesar-style salad for the entree and and the steak for the main. The salad came with about 3 small cubes of blue cheese (1cm3) but it was very tasty. The steak, on the other hand, was the best steak I had ever tasted. Tender, juicy, and flavourful. The sides that came along (thick sweet bacon, seasoned fries) were also big hits.The view outside the restaurant is amazing - I suggest coming here to watch the sun set over Marina Bay, and then hanging out until 8 when the Marina Bay Sands has its first laser show of the night
3
You are paying for the location here not for high quality cuisine or for good size servings. The food itself while nice didn't earn the high prices charged but what was most disappointing was that portions were so small-two crab cakes 16 dollars! All up a meal for two people including dessert & non alcoholic drinks was over 120 dollars. Food in Singapore can be really cheap or really expensive, this is a not so cheap option.
4
I love the decor. It is fabulously casual, yet elegant enough with its warm and sleek interior mix of red-orangy leather booths, quirky light fixtures and black and white-tiled flooring. In the coller eveing, I can imagine their alfresco deck with a view of the waterfront would be quite nice too.The black peppered candied bacon drizzled with lime, resembles the our local bak kwa but with much more crunch and flavour. And like the bak kwa, you won‚Äôt be stopping at just one piece. The Old fashioned crab cakes is crab-ilicious. I‚Äôve had more than my share of crab cakes when i was in washington DC recently but this two-cake dish has lots of filler, but it meshes nicely with the meat to create an almost sweet flavour. The hot toffee bread pudding was really tasty. Soft, fluffy and flavourful. Every bite was very satisfying. However, I was not so impressed with the lobster thermidor which was was slightly overcooked and was a bit tough but still good in flavour.If it was way less expensive, it‚Äôd be a true diamond in the rough. This is the true truth because I say it as it is‚Ä¶(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

It was friendly and light hearted. The service staff were good in the recommendations without being pushy.Wines were reasonably priced. Food was simple fresh and reasonable.Music was just right without being too loud.We shifted to outdoors al fresco for desserts as it was a lovely cool night.One of the great new restaurants which I would visit again for an evening out with friends
4
We enjoyed the food and atmosphere so much we went back again the next night! The Pelican was a good find! It was our first night in Singapore. We only intended to go down to Fullerton to see the spitting Merlion and take some pics of the MBS, but were tempted by the 1 for 1 happy hour from 5pm, stayed for a meal and the MBS laser light show at 8pm. We started with half dozen Fanny Bay oysters - highly overpriced at S$ 48, but the nicest oysters we have had in a long while! For mains we had grilled Red Bream (highly recommended) and the Swordfish (OK). On the next night we aimed for a less expensive bill so held the oysters and each of us ordered the Snapper Pie - huge and full of flavour. For us, The Pelican was the perfect package - two lovely evenings outdoors under the frangipani trees; great view; great meals; happy and fun staff with the added bonus of the amazing laser light show
2
We just had lunch at this place. Not a one person ate their entire dish. I had the seafood chowder, and it smelled so fishy i was afraid to eat more than a few bites. My wife had a sunflower seed soup. She said it was exceptionally bland. We split a summer salad which was also terrible. The sugary soy sauce dressing didn't work well with lettuce and feta cheese. Our guest and his wife had crab cakes and swordfish. The crab cakes were soft and mealy. The swordfish was dry and crumbly. One plus for this place was the mojitos . They worked well on a hot afternoon
4
We were there a few Saturday nights ago ( request for outdoor seats as close to the Singapore River as possible) and had a lovely time. The Candied Bacon is yummy, the crab cakes nice but I have to say the oysters were v overpriced. $48 for half a dozen oysters is not very friendly. Nevertheless, its a lovely way to spend an evening, admiring the view of MBS and watching the laser shows
5
This restaurant has only been open 3 months but it is in an excellent location with great views of Marina Bay Sands and exceptyional seafood. The platter for two for $99 is great value. Good wines and service means that for those people that do not want to travel out to the Jumbo complex this is a great alternative.I just hope it does not become too popular where I cannot get in next time
4
The Pelican is towards the end of One Fullerton, so it's not as loud as other places on this row. The outside seating was very comfortable and had a spectacular view of the light show at MBS across the bay.

Pros
(1) Food is fine.
Cons
(1) Very hot inside during lunch time.The air-con does not work well. You cannot enjoy your meal.
5
Great food & excellent service! We couldn't fault in the restaurant any way. Fantastic views of the light show. The portions were small but very tasty & you could tell they use fresh produce. Will be returning when in Singapore again.
3
Food was okay. Liked the miso cod and vanilla bean panna cotta. As with the restaurants in the area, a little expensive. If you are a tourist, can give it a try - the view of marina bay is nice.
3
One of teh many restaurants offering a view on the Marina sands and the bay. It offers the possibility to sit ouside even in case of small. A DJ is bringing music to make it lively. The ffod is nothing special but very expensive but its Singapore. Its easy to find a table compared to some other restaurants offering the same view. Is it a sign 
5
We went there as a family of 8. Had a couple of mojitos and very nice beer before the food arrives. They served these lovely in house made bread that resembles cookies and my children demolished 3 servings of those. They loved the clam chowder soup whilst we had the pot of prawns but the crab cakes took the star ! Main courses like the beef , sea bream , snapper pie and the chicken also were our favorite ! Finally the desert of " burger " chocolate were the children favorite. We went outside and admired the scenic view of the water & Marina Bay Sands , and we were so lucky to have caught the fireworks happening from Sentosa too. Overall a very very nice evening out

We have been regular guests here for over 6 years and have witnessed a disastrous deterioration in past few months. The service has become abysmal, food is cold and slow, reservations are abitrarily given away and the whole focus has shifted to churning tourists.We booked for a table by the water well in advance on a Friday night which was suddnely not available, our food was slow, cold and tasteless. The prices have gone up and the value has evaporated. Avoid this rip off establishment

I organised a diner for 6 at 8:30pm a Saturday night. We had asked for a table on the terrace to get a great view of Marina Bay and the Sands. The table was waiting for us and we sat down. We sat and noone came to ask id we wanted a drink. We got the menus but once again no one took iur orders for drinks. We had to insist to get someone to take our orders and food took about 40 mn to arrive. I was happy to find a bottle of Malbec Terrazas at a well priced S$80. Food was good but service was really bad. One should not have to look for waiters all the time...The order was also taken badly as my wife ended up eating beef when she ordered salmon. It would have been a perfect dinner with a more professional service.

The food and the view from the pierside was outstanding. the service was better than average for a busy night. However, the music piped in was really angry hip hop with curse words. Not a pleasant dinner atmosphere. I love hip hop and even angry hip hop but not when i am trying to dine in a beautify spot for a friends birthday. Despite the amzing view and good food and wonderful laser show from the meridian sands hotel, i probably would not have gone to the Pierside if i had known about the music forced upon my ears. too bad good place but if you want any peace go elsewhere

the starter at $24 is too small a portion. the bread served was also quite a disappointment. love the kurobuta pork though.

I fell in love with cod fish since I had it at Pierside in 2001 and I never found another restaurant that did it better

Nice & Creative seafood. Expensive though.

Good location but that's all that that's good about it. The service was disinterested and we felt rather rushed. The food looked interesting on the menu but it was uninspiring on the plate. Parts of my order were forgotten and the food was also not very hot. The bill was excessively high given the poor service, indifferent food and the sense of being shoved through a sausage factory. Give it a miss

The food at Pierside was ok, nothing mind-blowing. Our starters were rather forgettable - notably the 'brioche' that was suppose to come with the Pan-roasted Foie Gras was much like toasted supermarket white bread. Our mains and desserts were also 'safe' and predictable.Service wasn't great - our server oddly enough put us off ordering a few favoured items in the menu with off-putting comments like "it smells strong" or just plain straightforward opinions like "I don't think you should order that". Eh??? Halfway through the meal, it started to drizzle, and when we informed our server about wanting to move under the shade - he just said he would check - but he never came back! So we left as soon as we were done with dessert.That said, the views of Marina Bay Sands Resort were lovely, and we got to see the lights and water show from where we sat al-fresco

Ordered some seafood here, while I didn't find it spectacular, the food is ok. The view is very nice though looking out to Marina Bay (and the currently under-construction casino). The cocktails tasted more like cough medicines than an actual drink though. I would think that there are better places around for a dinner
