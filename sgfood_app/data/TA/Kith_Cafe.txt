First time visit for dinner. Quiet outlet with decent service. Servings fairly large. Good for sharing amongst small eaters.

Food good. Better if Kith could allow customers to choose coffee or tea with the set lunch.
Almost 3 months and Kith hasn't gotten landlord to fix the partially working air con.

Great food great ambience great service. So rare to find all three in one place these days. There's a good range of food and drink. The quality is good and consistent and service by staff Sarah was attentive and amazing.

I ordered black curry while my partner had carbonara. Both are alright but nothing special to mention about. Went there because they are on entertainer. Restaurant was not crowded at all, probably due to its location. they may have a better crowd during lunch time as they are near the offices.

After they moved from Park Mall and about 500m further from the office. The same efficient and friendly service, same quality and taste of food, especially the coffee, a slightly improved menu, slightly higher price, but it all worth the visit. Place is bigger with better seatings.

Must say that the lunch set with fish came with a fair amount of spaghetti. Usually, I don't like spaghetti but Kith's chef did it so very al dente with the fragrance of garlic done just right that I am still thinking about it. The air con was set too warm for a hot day

Friends wanted a chill feel. But the place felt more like a cafeteria. In a quiet corner of orchard, near kiliney road. Not hard to find. Good if you don't like the bustle of orchard malls. Ordered the executive lunch. Had choice of 3 types of meat. Chicken, red wine stew beef or pesto fish. It also came with a portion of the agli olio pasta from the set lunch and salad. I must say it was a good size portion. With ice tea. $20 ++ Pretty good value. Taste was ok. Not wow but better than some. My friend had the Kith breakfast. And black coffee. The coffee cup was real small. Abit bigger than espresso cup only. The kith breakfast was ok, nothing to wow. I think it's $19. On the whole, ok lah. Not some place you wanna die die must try. It's not really good for relaxing or chilling with a book. A meal & a chat, perhaps. Would I be back? Hard to say. So many cafes... not a super must.

This cafe was nestled amongst buildings near Lanson Place. It would be easily missed if you were not going down the main strip. The food was good quality and good size. Great French fries cooked well with truffles salt . My tuna sandwich was well season n plentiful on a toasted grain bread and the bacon n avocado wrap had a good mixture of crunchy greens. Watermelon n lychee crush was welcome on a hot day. We visited on a Sunday and it's a nice place for brunch or a coffee .. we will be back to try the Gula Melaka cak
