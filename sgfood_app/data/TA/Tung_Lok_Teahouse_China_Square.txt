You can see from the pictures how enjoyable the kids are in the restaurant with the warm service and decent home food in a trendy presentation. Worth for second visit.

It's been a very long while (~9years) since I last visited TLTH China Square after I left my ex-company, wanted to check out the place which brings fond memories dining with great colleagues. The quality / service remains v good till today...

As always food quality is commendable but the interior decor could do with a refresh. Overall decent place for a business lunch but be prepared to shout above the din during your conversations.

Fantastic dim sum and some slightly different things to what you get at the other dim sum restaurants. The baked char Siew bun were flaky and moist. Toilets were revolting though that kind of puts me off going back there again.

First time I've tried baked pau but they were delicious and crumbly and sweet. All other dim sum we tried was good too.

Went there Friday nite for dinner , see only 4 tables customer include us. Vry disappointed wth the staff can't help recommend us their restaurant signature food. average food over price restaurant

Tried the Ala Carte Buffet, only 3 items I would consider as worth eating, the rest are ordinary. If you just go there for the chilli crab, don't bother, the meat is very chewy & the sauce is very starchy, we sent it back, they replaced 2nd time & wasn't much better. Boring menu, nothing to shout about! Will not return a 2nd time for sure

I was staying at Amoy and this was close by. My flight got in late. I should have walked a few blocks to the hawkers on Cross or further down Amoy St. Service was poor. Food was mediocre at best. For the quality, this was very expensive and not a good value

Dinner a la carte buffet.you can made up to max 3 order from the menu. The braised pig trotter, fried sea bass, praen with wasabi, and many more sumptuous dishes. Great place for family dinner.

Food was nice but nothing spectacular compared to other Chinese Dimsum places.

I have been to a few Tung Lok restarents in Singapore but by far Tung Lok @ Square 2 in Novena is the worst I have tried!The food is oily and tim sum fillings are really pathetic!Let me give a breakdown on the food I tried, from passable to bad in stardard.1. Signature Cheong Fun $8.50 - This is Chee Cheong Fun grap in Fried Prawn. Taste is OK, a bit oily tough2. Deep Fried Prawn Roll $5.30 - OK, since it is deep fried, you expect to be oily in nature3. Prawn Vermicelli $18 - Taste was OK as the sauce is soaked into the vermicelli. However, the prawn is not fresh and it is pretty oily. Portion at $18 is considered pretty small.4. Deep Fried Yam Puff $4.80 - OMG this is just YAM and tiny winny bit of "Truffle mushroom"!!! Oily too5. Minced Pork Rice $4.20 - Just some chopped pork with half a egg and black sauce on white rice, nothing close to those you eat in Taipei for sure! No fragrance! 6. Malai Sponge Cake $3.80 - Short of the gula melaka taste though it is pretty soft7. Siew Mai $5.80 - Ordinary, passable8. Mushroom bun $4.80 - 1 of the worst version I tried, hard dry bun shaped like mushroom, and the so called truffle inside is pathetic again, everyone just dont want to continue after 1 bite9. Sweet Sour Chrysantemum Fish $28 - This is the worst worst dish we had! The fish is NOT fresh, and you cannot see much fish meat at all, 80% are fried flour! The sweet sour taste.....sour! 4 small pieces of flour, at $28!!!Regretted visiting this restaurant. The deco is nice from outside. $130+ for 3pax, it is not worth it with the quality! go Tung Lok Seafood at Orchard Central, it is many times better

This place in the Far East Square (not China Square) food complex adjacent to the Amoy hotel has ample (retro) curb appeal, the young waitstaff are very nice, & the food was generally quite good (deep fried fish skin, fish noodle with spicy Teochew sauce, steamed crystal dumplings). The fish skin was delicately crispy, if a bit oily, the noodles had that hand-pulled texture, & the steamed dumplings boasted an unusually delicate skin, not at all doughy.As other reviewers have noted, however, prices here are much steeper than at nearby places with more humble ambiance (S$53 for my solo dinner). This was made worse because they brought an extra dish of dim sum (which I accepted to see how they would handle the situation - not clear if it was a genuine misunderstanding on their part or a deliberate attempt to gouge a non-local). In addition, they also charged $4 for a cup of tea as well as $4 for a dish of cashews that were brought to the table without any explanation. So what I thought would be a $31 meal turned out to be closer to double the price. I'll chalk it up to experience, but you may prefer to get much better value elsewhere

I had dinner with a friend at TungLok Tea House. The restaurant appeared busy and we were lucky to get seating (on a Saturday) without reservation. We went primarily vegetarian and the food was really good, with authentic Chinese flavours. The service was okay, but really it more more efficiency than warmth and friendliness. We had received the wrong bill which was sorted out at payment at the counter. Overall, it was definitely good food, perhaps overpriced in some instances with room for improvement with regard to service

Went there on Friday evening 7pm; restaurant below half full. ordered a mix of dim sum and menu dishes.our key order in dim sum place is xia long bao; unfortunately at 7pm they were already sold out ? black bean rib came last of our order so, at least, freshly cooked i guess ;-)had plum sauce claypot tofu with orange taste that was a surprise too. don't know if this is meant like this. soya duck was good if a tad dry.anyway, not a notable dinner. restaurant itself is standard; location in singapore is nice. lots of bars to stroll around. very busy Friday evening

We had aa few appetizers before dinner, rice roll with crispy stuff prawn is really delicious, silver bait & fish skin (too oily) Crispy duck wrap (something like beijing duck) is nice but could improve on the quality of the wrap. All the pictures uploaded are all very delicious. Service was prompt and good, deserved a star and a happy customer returning soon to this restauran

We enjoyed a meal at Tung Lok while staying at a nearby hotel. As Australians we stood out as being about the only non-locals in the restaurant. We weren't disappointed with the meal or service. Flavours were great. Not a real lot to choose from on the drinks menu, so this is not the place to go if you want a good wine with your meal! At S$120 for two, it was definitely not cheap, but it was an enjoyable meal

I'm a Singaporean, and to me... it's difficult to find a restaurant that serves good dim sum at a reasonable price. I noticed this restaurant for some times... but never thot of trying... we had a gathering here for dim sum as lunch. Firstly, it's not very crowded on a Saturday... we paid a bill of Ard $105 for 3 pax for a dim sum lunch.... which is reasonable pricing in Singapore, given that the food is good and don't have to queue so long like Tim Ho Wan. Worth the try... on weekends as it's usually crowded on weekdays. Given it's location at the CBD area.

Mad Poet is a real find. They do great food with some excellent value choices for lunch. They also do some great wines and nice prices to match. The service is always nice and friendly. The location and outdoor is also great.What more can you want from a casual dining venue in Singapore? Great for drinks and snacks with friends, for business or dinner/lunch with wine/beer
