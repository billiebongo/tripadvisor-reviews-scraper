Has a chance to try their crab promo but their usual menu selection does the trick.
Excellent taste and did not have that thirsty after feeling of MSG laden food.

Had dinner here after our cycling & activities. The food was really good; I like their Curry fish head, Baby Assam and Ayam Buah Keluok (spicy porks and chicken) most.
Very quick and sufficient service.
Best place to chill in Punggol end. Thumbs upppppp

Dropped in on new years celebrations at this small restaurant. The family had gathered for celebrations but they warmly welcomed an extra table for two. The beef rendang was superb and we tried several other vegetable dishes which were equally as good. Given the crowd for new years celebrations the service was attentive and quick, never left waiting for drinks or food. Looking forward to returning

This Peranakan restaurant at Zion Road is aptly named, Simply Peranakan. It is simply decorated but I love the clever and pretty installation of 24 Peranakan plates on the wall. Run by a husband and wife team, he’s the chef and she serves and run the front of house. It was nothing too fancy but she was courteous and authentic.We started with the bakwan kepiting (meat ball soup with julienne of turnips). Then we had the chap chye (braised cabbage) and an omelet with anchovies. The lady boss recommended their assam fish head curry which was a meal in itself: half a fish head with ample flesh cooked with lots of brinjals and lady’s fingers. The lady cautioned that it was enough food for we couldn’t resist ourselves and added the ngoh hiang (meat and prawn roll). It was twice the normal size and comes with crunchy chunks of water chestnut.It was an enjoyable meal because the simple service and food reminded me of a home cooked meal. Nothing too ostentatious. The owner even suggested that we pack the curry home and eat it with roti prata the next day; just like mum would do.I’m not sure if it belonged to them but there’s a durian stall outside the restaurant. If you choose not to have their nonya desserts, you can always have fresh durians instead. How authentic is that to complete your meal

Came with my family for dinner. Ordered Ayam buah keluak, fish maw soup, otah, sambal Sotong, chap chye, lady's fingers, Ngoh Hiang. Very yummy. I have been to many peranakan food, this is by far the best. The price is also very reasonable.

Simply Peranakan place is great - it has changed the neighborhood for the better. The beef rendang and chicken (ayam buah keluak). Far better than the chain, IndoChili, which is next door. My main complaint is that the dishes mentioned can be too oily ... it would not be hard to skim of the excess

We liked the dishes, especially the Sambal Petai with Prawns and Assam Fish Head Curry. The food is almost like home cooking.Shireen, one of the partners, welcome feedback on the menu

On 10 June 2017 my Cousin and I went to Simply Peranakan for lunch. We ordered the sambal Kang Kong, sambal petai with prawns, rendang and sweet and sour pork. Both my Cousin and I normally eat very little but all the dishes we ordered were just too yummy for words. I surprised myself by having a second helping of rice which I have not done for a good 30 years. My compliments to the Chef and the owners. Will be back

The restaurant is located close to the night light show, performance arenas and the Esplanade MRT Station. On our visit on a Saturday night the restaurant was fairly quiet and we weren't sure what this indicated. The meals on the menu appeared to be authentic Peranakan (Malaysian / Chinese) and our Singaporean friend made a few meal suggestions. Together we ordered two entrees and three main meals of varying sizes. The meals were delivered in a very reasonable time. I particularly enjoyed the Nyonya NGO Hiang, Pineapple rice and the mango salad. While the staff were not the most friendly and not all of the staff spoke English, the night was enjoyable. I felt meals were a little expensive, and the diner should be aware that additional costs will be added to the bill - such as disposable towel costs, service charge of 10%, cold tap water (we only found out the additional charges when the bill was presented). My husband suggested a 3 rating for this restaurant but I felt the extra star was warranted as the meals were quite tasty and the service was prompt

Had a relaxing walk around Esplanade with 4 of my friends..decided to try out the food at the openair food place..Simply Peranakan. We waited about 15 to 20 minutes before we finally found a table. We ordered..or rather bought..because it was self service..satay, chilli crab, fried hokkien mee, fresh coconuts and cendol. All were not what one would expect of Singapore's popular local dishes should taste. We noticed some food were left nearly untouched on tables, even the grilled lobsters..The famous chilli crabs were the worst, swimming in a sea of starchy..tasteless gravy.The fried hokkien mee was terribly salty. The satay was alright. But the cendol was a huge disappointment..the red beans were hard and tasteless! Lastly..we bought 4 fresh coconuts..and instead of being refreshed by this ..we were appalled at the exorbitant price and quality!As we all love our Singaporean cuisine..and are proud that our Singaporean food is renowned all over the world..what would any tourist..think if they had a meal at Simply Peranakan?? Therefore it is time to look into the QC of this food place to do justice to our Singaporean cuisine
