Casual atmosphere where you write down your selections on an order sheet and the waiting staff, take the list away to be prepared. Good Tom Yam soup, average Vietnamese spring rolls

Stopped twice for late lunch/early dinner. If you are Thai cuisine expert you'll be disappointed but not bad at all. Reasonably priced, quick service and good portions.
For me it was good enough to come back.

Decent place. Price is OK. The portions are reasonable. But it's hardly a Thai cuisine. Everything we tried tasted very much like Chinese food. If you are hungry and just need a decent inexpensive meal, this is the place.

We lived close to this gem for two years and still drop by to savour the familiar taste. A well priced thai joint that serves very good quality food round the clock . You can't go wrong with this one!

Great food with affordable prices. Really good selection of dishes, service is very quick even though normally they are very busy! I always get beef salad, mango salad, tom yam & pad Thai. Can't go wrong!

The pros : overall quick service, good steamed fish dish
The cons: service despite being quick is a bit messy and disorganized. Most dishes are average at best, chicken and pork for roasting were totally tasteless. No tissue offered on the table.

Tomyum goong here is quite flavourful and comes in a large portion. Papaya salad and pineapple rice are really tasty as well. Food here is very fairly priced. Only detriment is they do not accept visa payment.

We discovered this restaurant couple of year ago by chance. It is not too far away from Rendez-vous Hotel and the Art Institute.Excellent Pad Thai, Kha Phrao Lard! Also they offered a beautiful Larb Moo (spicy salad).The price OK and the service is very good. Wonderful setting

This humble restaurant is situated along middle road, opposite Wilkie Edge, near Peace Center. We are a regular customer since 2014. So far the best Thai Restaurant for me, the food's aroma and taste. Hmm! Price friendly, they do accept nets terms now. Staffs were friendly and it operates till 4am. They do serve local beers as well.

I visited this restaurant with my family 2 weeks ago when we were in Singapore. The Food was very close to what it tasted like back in Thailand. The staff are friendly and recommended us their signature food. What was shocking was that i ordered a bottle of beer and expected a bigger bottle for SGD13.00++ but was disappointed that i was served a small bottle...The Japanese Restaurant next door was serving the same size at SGD6.000...I felt that i was cheated and ripped off on the price of the beer. The bill was around SGD70.00++ for 5 dishes which is very expensive for Thai Food and there is no feeling of being in a Thai Restaurant as well..I might not come back to this restaurant unless the price goes down especially the beer

I always visit here during my break and I find the place very comfy in the heart of CBD area.
Foods are nice cheap and the place is also air conditioned

found a disgusting paper towel in my food and a slimy consistency at the bottom of my dish. will never go back

This rest has a limited menu but whatever is served is good.A must try is the steamed fish in spicy-sour sauce. Their Tom Yam is awesome. The spice level is that of food in Bangkok and really tasty...The service needs more improvement. More customer service skills required here. Do check the bills as they never fail to make mistakes and include the wet tissues when the one didn't take it

Very understated from the outside but food is amazing. Service was a bit haphazard but we weren't in a hurry and the general ambience of the place makes you realise you just have to go with it. The boys had red Thai curry which was delicious but made your eyes water a bit. My daughter's prawn dish was too hot for her so they redid it and it was delicious. Will hopefully fit in another visit before we leav

This restaurant is totally not eye catchy from the street and is small. However understands from my friends that it has been around for quite a while. We ordered the Tom yum kung and it lacked punch... the mango salad was decent but the bitter groud with egg was nicely fried and delicious. The aroma was so pleasing when they served it. We ordered the steamed seabass and they gave an additional bowl of the soup with it. The fish soup sauce had balanced spice and herbs and goes exceptionally with the fresh seabass. The pad Thai was a little wet to my liking but it had good flavor. Overall it was an enjoyable dinner and prices are decent. As of service it was acceptable for a small casual restaurant

This is a review of Aroy Dee at Circular Road (behind Boat Quay).The food is very reasonably priced (about US$5 for a main course + drink - see pictures of the menu) and is of a decent quality though portions are on the small side. What spoilt the entire experience for us today is the hugely inefficient ordering system the restaurant operates. You are meant complete your order on a form, then queue to pay after which the food gets served. We waited more than 20 minutes just to place our order with the cashier - a brave young lady who was left to single handedly take orders and payment from customers and, serve up drinks to customers at the payment counter right after after orders are placed. What contributed to the long wait was the cashier's very basic English ability resulting in a series of miscommunications and customers getting the wrong drinks. She also had a difficult time responding to questions from customers about the food.After you actually get to place your order, the food rolls out of the kitchen fairly quickly.Several people who managed to get tables walked out because they could see the queue was going nowhere

Really bad service, waited a way to long for the food. They ask us to write down our order and than forgot it. I have ordered a soup and it was just uneatable! I never had such a terrible food. So I paid and left. By the way: this is my first review...just disappointed

Aroy-Dee is open for lunch and dinner and is not a 24-hour restaurant as someone mentioned. The food is good, and comes out very quickly, there are no napkins on the table and you get up pay. . . this is a no-frills quick stop bite of tastyThai food that I would highly recommend in a city where food prices are generally high
5
Probably the best Thai food in Singapore! Taste is very well done and it's like you are eating in Thailand. The green curry is a must, and the som tam, and minced meat with basil and chili. Pricing very reasonable for Singapore and perfect for a after work dinner

Went to location near Foch Rd and Jln Besar intersection (off of lavender Rd). They have changed names, but owners seem to be the same. First stall in an open air food court. Service was unfriendly, but the food was so good we didn't mind! Try the green chicken curry -- never had it seasoned so well! Prawn pad Thai was good, but not excellent. Mango salad was superb
