Unexpected Italian flair in the bedok neighbourhood. Real Italian pizza oven, fresh ingredients. Will definitely visit again

This is the real deal, folks. Their pizza is perfect in my opinion:1. The crust: They make their own crust and cook it in a brick oven. It's thin, but not to the point where it's crunchy like a cracker. The flavor of the crust is perfect.2. The rest: Like a real Italian pizza, the cheese and sauce are used sparingly, so the pizzas are not heavy or greasy.The pizzas are only available in 7" and 12". This is an excuse to get a few and have some variety.Pizzas I've had:Parma HamSpinaciMargeritaMushroomAll were delicious, and I'd order them all again.The staff here is very friendly too

Let's be clear: I come with 20 years of pizza baking expertise and being neapolitan pizza my preferred food, I approached this new establishment with quite a dose of skepticism as it's rare or close to impossible to eat a pizza in Singapore like those made in Italy.Yet, the pizza I had it's really the closest one to the real neapolitan pizza. The dough is very light (a sign that proper dough rising has taken place) and a large pizza can be eaten by an adult (or a kid) without any problem.I do recommend this outlet for a casual dinner - the place has about 20 seats altogether. The staff is friendly.Close your eyes, smell the pizza and fly to Napoli with your imagination
