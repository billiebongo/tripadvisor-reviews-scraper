Overall pleasant experience. Chempedak creme brulee, pie tee, chili crayfish, seafood on ice, lamb chop, bread butter pudding, desserts, pengat durian were all good. The rest of the dishes i didnt try because wasnt that appetizing.

Great place n food but some food not topup after finish.
Appreciate to have more choices of seafood.

Kitchen@Katong can put in my Favourite restaurant on the next visit cause the foods taste very marvellous, clean and good environment.
1
58 ++.
I rather travel further down south to central MBS and pay additional 20 for quality food.
It is not worth the trip and bring family to this restaurant.
5
We are a group of 12 ex-classmates. We chose Katong Kitchen because they serve Halal food. We have 3 muslims with us. The variety of the buffet is plentiful. For $48 per pax, it is value for money. Though I do not need to eat Halal food, I will definitely bring my family here. The laksa and Peranakan food are highly recommended!
4
Good service and it was my second visit to celebrate my mum's birthday. A little disappointed that the restaurant didn't offer the nonya kuehs as i think they're good! I casually included that it's for my mum's birthday in the reservation and the restaurant actually prepared a slice of cake for her
3
It was disappointing for the poor value for money. We have visited this restaurant twice last year and food quality and spread had been reasonable. However, the spread and quality was lousy for the $68 charged on CNY. For this price, I might as well go to Feast at East at Roxy Mecure next door
2
I have been to Katong Kitchen for a few times and this is my first time trying out their CNY Buffet with my family. The seafood area, the cooked food area were not promptly refill. It could be they are lack of manpower due to the festive season. Also even it is refilled, only a small portion of oysters, no crab, prawns came later. The cooked food area is the same. Besides that it is not cheap and my family didn't have a satisfied meal
3
The quality of food has dropped. The cracker, you tiao was hard and not chewable. The bread pudding too. The nyonya popiah doesn‚Äôt taste good. The food wasn‚Äôt topped up immediately and most of the selection were pretty little. The laksa was still good, the dessert such as the mango sticky rice too. And the 1-1 offer made it not too bad
4
My forth trip to the restaurant . My friends were impressed with the buffet spread .Planning my next visit this Friday. Very pleasant and attentive staff.Improvement on the soup and more choices on breads would be great. I like the selection on the main courses good combination. Keep it Up
5
Satisfying lunch with good service and ambience. Food spread was wide and delicious. My fourth visit to this excellent place
5
The booking was easily done through CHOPE, There was a wide variety of food. It is value for money and atmosphere quiet and conducive for a family gathering cum birthday dinner. The staff were all very helpful.
4
The food, ambiance, environment, atmosphere was good especially with awesome company! Great for families too!
4
Nice buffet but location abit far. For seafood section variety can be improved.ambient is ok service is ok.
3
It was normal buffet spread considering it is a new year and the price. Not very spectacular. Liked the steamed and grilled shrimp, creme brulee chempadak
5
Wide variety of peranakan food! Beef rendang was the best..
Great staff service as well! Quite expensive though..
5
Pleasantly surprised by the wide spread of buffet dishes, and overall food was great. The fresh seafood corner made the visit even more worth it! Would be even better if the restaurant could offer cold beverages (soft drinks, lemonade etc)
4
While some buffets might have a larger array of items, Katong Kitchen keeps it simple by offering quality food that matters, such as the signature katong laksa (I slurped up the gravy!), the durian mousse, the chilli crayfish, etc. There is a free flow drinks station with Bandung and house-brewed iced tea. I topped up my dinner with a lovely bowl of red bean soup - just the way I like it. The buffet truly stays true to the location of the hotel - the Katong / Peranakan flavour.
5
I brought my team there to thank them for the hard work. I chose the place because one team member is a Muslim. They were all pleasantly surprised by the spread and quality of food as well as the service. Service staff is friendly, attentive and willing to go out of their way. My Muslim colleague immediately said she would take her parents there. Overall a good dining experience for us
5
I have made reservation on 22nd dec for our Company Xmas gathering for the 39 0f us. It was our first time there for all of us. I was looking for a decent Halal Buffet and glad we have it at Katong Kitchen. Overall for the price we paid i felt that its value for us. Nice ambience. Most importantly good tasting and fresh spread. To my opinion its better than Fairmont‚Äôs Asian Market in terms of taste and quality for Local Buffet. And over the top if compared to Tiffany‚Äôs at Furama.Rendang meat is tender and flavourful, Grilled prawns fresh, great variety of desserts with nyonya kueh selection rich in flavour, self made rojak and kueh pie tee, fish cooked in white sauce yummy, good selection of salads, laksa and soups and lots more. I requested for a Muslim prayer area, they opened a small conference room and a prayer mat in the restaurant area. Since most of us are driving i cant comment on the location. Just that the entrance a bit hassle to find.When all of us arrived, the trays of food some are half or almost empty. But it was topped up shortly and we have got piping hot food. Thank you Katong Kitchen
4
Not crowded. Good spread of Christmas roasts on top of the usual fare. Good value for money. Easy to book as they respond to fb queries quite soon.
5
I book from here told that i need cosy place since its my wedding anniversary and the staff surprised us with anniversary cake
4
Due to the corporate dinner event going on, the atmosphere was extremely noisy. Food was amazing except the lack of variety.
5
we are hving our company Christmas lunch and all of them gave a thumbs-up for the food and atmosphere there. the pricing is definitely worth it considering the good spread of food. intend to bring my family there for the Christmas feast again.
5
Quality food choice for all. Seafood on ice was fresh. Will definitely make a trip there again with my family.
5
I love Katong Kitchen. I come here with my husband about once a month. This time I brought 3 old friends. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly with the great variety of food and friendly service
3
Variety was ok bt food was nt tasty.. bland actually.. drinks limited & dispenser was nt working well.. my drink spills everytime when refilling.. sashimi was too chunky.. desserts & service were good tho..
3
Not my first visit and i agree the service are good but not on the Christmas eve. The staff could do better but it‚Äôs Christmas, it become a routine day. First of all i was greet with a ‚Äúwe only open at 630pm‚Äù while i was browsing the food at the entrance. They are busy chatting before the opening, they could do a better then this. Food was ok, i select here because of the kuah pie tee, always my fav. The rest of the food are ok and value for money. Desert should improve more, since it‚Äôs Christmas , i see only log cake and the rest are the same as usual. Lack of the Christmas spirt, staff never greet Merry Christmas too. The service level drop and took them sometime before someone come to clear those left over plate on my table.
5
We are regulars here since 2013 and this restaurant has never failed to deliver good food and excellent service. We always feel welcomed by the staff and they take the time to pay attention to our needs, especially when our little one is around. From the period of service by Mr Dicky to the current manager Mr Leo, each visit is always special regardless of occasion. Thank you for the extra attention to details. 
3
The overall food quality is just average. The Briyani rice and roast beef was tough and cold. The satay was cooked over a stove and not over open flame. Took a long time to replenish the durian pudding, had just one serving in the two hours we were there. They only served plain water and hot drinks. A couple of highlights includes a good Laksa, durian pudding (if you can get your hands on one) and the Cheese cake.Overall I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for the price.
4
I love the variety of food they serve. Our team enjoyed our dinner very much. Service staff are also friendly and efficient.
5
The food taste good and the buffet has a reasonable amount of selection ranging from seafood, cooked food to desserts. The laksa is a must try in the buffet as well as the durian dessert.
4
Was disappointed as I remember this restaurant serves Peranakan food but the selection was very small.
4
went for a birthday celebration using entertainer
the spread was indeed quite alright, taste wise good as well except for the sashimi which could be improved
love the kueh pie tee n durian pengat thou!
5
Homely and warmly ambience. Great service from the team. Mary was very attentive to details, she approached me and ask if I need any assistance. Food was good, love the DIY Kueh Pie Tee station. üëçüèº
3
It was our first time dining at this place. Family commented if compared to another established place which offered also international buffet spread which is just nearby the food selection and spread were much lesser for the adults and young children. We were surprised that we actually paid more when we did a comparison later for the lunch buffet (though a certain card promotion was used). On the positive side, the laksa was yummy and some of the desserts were good. We must compliment and with the service provided by the restaurant manager, Mr Leo. He was pleasant and attentive in what he did - not only to my family but to the other diners too - providing service with a smile :
4
It's our first visit here & the food is nice & tasty..Especially the cempedak Creme brulee..Looking forward to taste the ayam buah keluak but was not in the menu..The grill is a disappointment coz dey only served grill prawns..Shld hv more varieties..other den that, the service was good & friendly too..Will definitely come again wif my family & friends..
4
Went here to celebrate my parent's anniversary. There was a variety of dishes to choose from. It was a nice place with friendly staffs. There was a complimentary cake from the restaurant itself for my parents. Overall, I love the desserts especially the cempedak creme brule and durian pengat. It was a bonus point for me
5
Celebrated my wedding anniversary here.The buffet had sufficient variety for its price. The local food was particularly delicious. My dad, who is 87 and usually does not eat much, ate like he was a growing teenager. He polished off 2 bowls of laksa, one bowl of rice noodles, had at least 2 plates of hot food and a couple rounds of local dessert, including 3 shots of durian penyat.My only regret - my calorie count rocketed through the roof as I could not stop stuffing my face.The staff, lead by Leo, who was initially cold but warmed up as the meal got on, were efficient and friendly. All were good but I only managed to get to know Amy from Myanmar and Mary from the Philippines at the end of the meal. The Chef who was preparing the laksa and satay was very helpful and friendly.Will return
4
I came here twice, once for lunch and recently for dinner buffet. Both occasions were for birthday celebrations and I would say I enjoyed both times very much. The restaurant wasn't very big yet there're quite a lot of dishes even for lunch. There are more dishes for dinner but I actually preferred the lunch menu somehow. Dishes worth trying are mutton rendang, nasi lemak, Satay, laksa, kueh pie tee, kueh2 (esp. ondeh2), the durian cake and durian pengat! Dinner dishes that I like: laksa, prawn tempura, kueh pie tee, fried noodle, cempedak creme brulee, durian pengat. There're also some cold cooked seafood (crab legs, crab claws, prawns, scallops), fresh oysters and sashimi for both lunch and dinner.
3
A reasonable spread of local cuisine. There is a limited variety of fresh seafood - oysters, tuna & salmon sashimi. The durian penyat, crayfish in Chili sauce and laksa are good.
3
Buffet breakfast was average. Same every day and sometimes the food was either cold or the closhes empty.
5
Cosy and intimate ambience.
The food variety was a definite value for money! Worth every dollar.
Would definitely come back for another round :-)
4
I'm a regular at this place. I enjoy the cosy feel of the place and the food is quality. It's a more quiet place compared to the other bigger halal buffet places.
4
Atmosphere, food and value for money - is reasonable.
The laksa is worth trying-very tasty. Most of the dishes was not spicy.
It will nicer if a little spicy on some of the dishes.
3
Previous experiences were good but this time the experience was sub-par. Mussels were mushy and not fresh, slipper lobsters were not topped up even though it was far from closing time, and rice was not available at the buffet table. The staff were kind enough to provide the rice to our table upon request though
4
Katong Kitchen provides great array of delicious local and international dishes. My guests and I enjoyed the variety of dishes especially the DIY rojak corner, durian pengat and laksa special. The crayfish sambal sauce was nice, fried rice was great and we loved the sambal belacan and seafood corner. We had a great dinner. Keep up the standard, KK
2
Went there for dinner to celebrate my sister's birthday. It was so crowded but I could only see one waitress serving everyone. The dessert bar was completely empty by 9am and had to look around for the waiter but couldn't find any. For the price we're paying you might as well go to the other hotel restaurants where service is so much better.
5
Perfect service for a quaint little family-sized restaurant. A delectable selection of Asian cuisine finely presented and well prepared. Most importantly headed by a passionate manager that takes pride in caring for his customers! Well done to restaurant manager Marco! Always a pleasure to dine in
4
We had dined previously at lunch but this was the first time in the evening. The format was more or less the same but there were some changes in the dishes, including curry lobster which was very tasty. Other highlights were the laksa and char kway teoy - classics done very well
4
It was a great restaurant with good Peranakan food. Loved the sambal belachan. Durian Pengat was addictive! They have salad bar, sushi, oysters, mussels & crabs. Great value for money.
5
We had the brunch meal and i am satisfied with the food and service.
The captain marcus was very attentive and our dirty plates were cleared instantly.
5
Food was delicious. Ambiance was pretty much inviting. Hard to locate the place via car because of the roadworks.
4
Staff attitude was the highlight of my Katong Kitchen experience. My friend and I were very well taken care of. The staff members there made us feel really at home and happy to be there.
5
Enjoyable buffet lunch with discount from safra membership. Wide variety of peranakan dishes such as DIY rojak and kueh pie tee. Desserts were good as well. Very thoughtful of the staff to request for noodle/rice dish for vegetarian!

I brought my parents to Katong Kitchen for the buffet dinner on a Saturday night in early August 2017. We arrived at 7.30pm and the restaurant was close to full house. As the restaurant is located just outside the main banquet ballroom, it was rather busy that evening with a wedding dinner going on just outside the lifts. Given that it was a Saturday night, we had to wait for awhile to be attended to but this was not an issue for us. The restaurant is not big and we were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, where there were also several other large groups having dinner that evening. As the description of the buffet highlights Peranakan cuisine, we were certainly looking forward to a spread of Peranakan cuisine like Ayam Buah Keluak, Bakwan Kepeting, Sambal Udang and the like. However, I must confess that the buffet spread was very disappointing. I think the only hot dish that was truly Peranakan in nature was the Ayam Pongteh. The other hot dishes seemed fairly ordinary.Some of the highlights in the buffet spread included:- Seafood on ice (oysters, crab legs, prawns, mussels and clams)- Salmon and tuna sashimi, along with a small assortment of sushi- Roast beef on rack- Fishball noodles and laksa (both cooked to order)- Cooked-to-order chicken chop- Prawn fritters and vegetable tempura- Kueh Pie Tee and Rojak station- Durian Penyet- Nonya Kueh and Ice Cream (local flavours like yam and coconut)- Drinks station (Bandung, Ice Lemon Tea and Coffee/ Tea)Unfortunately the seafood on ice was a major disappointment. The oysters were not fresh and were mushy. Apart from the prawns, the crab legs and lobsters also tasted fishy. The cook-to-order stations were very ordinary and very inadequately staffed - my mum had to wait 10 minutes to be served as there was just a single chef attending to all 4 stations. The hot dishes weren't memorable, while the Kueh Pie Tee and Rojak stations were good but these are largely self service items so it's not a lot of effort on the part of the kitchen. Truth be told, the highlight for me was probably the Keropok (fried crackers) station where these came freshly fried and you could help yourselves to sambal belachan (smashed chilli).All in all, for the price paid (S$58++ per pax), we left sorely disappointed as you could probably have a much better buffet in town for that price or if you're craving Peranakan food, the S$160++ could probably get you a feast at a Peranakan restaurant
5
We arrived late at around 1pm but staff managed to make sure that the food was restocked and avail. Even till last 30 mins of the buffet, my bf realised that our Favourite mango sticky rice for dessert section was oos and we didn't get to try, the manager was really kind enough to ask the kitchen to restock more. Thumbs up for good service
4
When we reached the restaurant at 6.30, we had the pleasure of the place to ourselves. The service was attentive and warm.The seafood options included oysters, crab claws and prawns amongst other shellfish. The roast beef and lamb chops were a little dry and I would have preferred the option of mustard and mint sauce on the side, though the black pepper sauce was adequate as well.The highlights were the Asian signatures - the laksa was flavourful and delicious, as was the prawn mee. I loved the rojak station and gado-gado and pairing the mutton curry with their artisanal bread was a personal triumph. (I like bread.) Dessert wise, the durian pengat and chempedak Creme br√ªl√©e alone would have many us all happy campers.
4
The buffet spread may be limited,but you may be surprised that you can't just finish eating in an hour!Spreading from laksa to durian paste,their is much more than you can hold.I recommend trying their laksa,their specialty.Its a must!Once you have tried,you will know how delicious the other foods would be.Enjoy!Btw the hotel is very secluded in Katong V.So find it fast and fill your stomach now
4
This is what I would call a manageable buffet spread. It is not so overwhelming that you don't know where to start. Perfect for someone like me who never seems to get their money's worth at a buffet because my tummy just doesn't stretch that much. With a predominantly Peranakan theme you'll find many tasty curries and a laksa station, as well as a modest seafood spread, a carvery, a salad selection and desserts. Hot and cold drinks are also included. Add to the delicious food, friendly service and efficient service and you'll enjoy a pleasant dining experience.
4
We were a group of 6 friends and we were pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of food. As we were using the entertainer app, the food was value for money.
5
Yummmmmeh buffet of fresh Seafood and sushi, good choices of local mains, excellent dessert spread.. Good place to bring the whole family for a feast. Attentive and effiecient staff.
3
Went for the lunch buffet. Food was alright, ambience was nice. Served by Marco who was attentive and quick.
4
Surprisingly buffet spread was good üëçand ambience was cozy. Reasonably priced and affordable‚ò∫Ô∏è Service was excellent üëå
4
First time dining in Katong Kitchen and i was impressed with their services and food quality. As a picky eater, I am very particular with cleanliness and the freshness of the cold dishes. It turned out great and atmosphere was pleasant. Would give full 5 stars rating if they could have a bigger space in between the tables so we are not near to other guests and get to listen to their conversation. Will make a comeback on the normal days for dinner again.
5
The breakfast spread has a nice mix of Asian and Western served buffet-style, including a number of stations where you can have the food prepared to your liking √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú noodle & congee station, egg station, nasi lemak station. Our daughter liked the selection of fruit juices, while the grown-ups enjoyed the espresso machine
5
This is not our first visit to Katong Kitchen.The good food and excellent service has always been the reason why we revisit this place.The cold lobsters, prawns, oysters and Alaska Crab Legs is a very good starter.The laksa is nice and creamy. The warm food section has beef, mutton, seafood and noodles. I especially like the dessert section. It has a good spread of cakes, and Peranakan pastries.Special thanks to Marco for being an excellent host
5
Brought my parents to Katong Kitchen as they always enjoy Perankan food and we had an enjoyable time there. The experience was so good that I went back the second time within a month, this time with my in laws and the extended family. We thoroughly enjoyed the buffet spread and the desserts were a favorite among my family. Special thanks to Marco and the team who attended to us with patience and care; their excellent service makes the whole time there a wonderful one! Looking forward to be back and would highly recommend to my friends too!
4
was there for dinner on mother's day, and the staff was awesome & very attentive to our needs! i had a 5yo and a toddler with me, and they did not hesitate to entertain and even attend to their needs! a special shout out to Dicky who definitely made our evening better.
4
Wahhh this is great price to pay on weekday if you are singtel subscriber show the singtel bill you get one for one your bill is sd20per person super wide spread at this price I wonder how the keep the standard of food quality so high
4
Stayed in Village Hotel Katong and was entitled for a complimentary breakfast. Breakfast spread was good, and staff was attentive in clearing plates.
4
Ala carte food variety was not great and the taste was average. Nothing fascinating but the place hosted us pretty well!
2
Worst food, most of them was tasteless, not worth the money spend. Service was excellent with niece ambince
3
Went to this place for a celebration.
Quite a nice place for family with young kids. Quiet and nice
Food selection is not that wide but still acceptable.
3
A three star hotel... and it's cafe.
Inexpensive buffet with average quality food. Ok selection buffet. Service is so so.
3
Average Service & Poor Food Selection. Do not have Peranakan Food like Ayam Buah Keluak, Itik Itim..
4
Visited with friends on a weekday for their halal buffet which is a rare thing in Singapore. Location is not accessible by MRT unless u want to wait for e future Thomson-Eastern Line in 2020...lol. food spread is sufficient for a decent buffet and nice. Weekday is not packed that means less people to bump into haha. Will return again as the servers n supervisor r really nice n friendly
5
Was there on 15 March with friends for dinner. The buffet spread was good and the sashimi fresh. The belachan chilli was the authentic version and the inclusion of nonya kuehs to the dessert selection is a nice touch. Manager Marco and his attentive team provided wonderful service that harks back to the leisurely pace of old Di Tanjong Katong
5
a variety for everyone. a good selection that won't overwhelm your taste palate. there's cold seafood platter - oysters too. japanese selection - sashimi too. noodles section - you are in luck if they serving laksa as their gravy is delicious. western section - delicious mushroom soup. their mashed potatoes are superb. grilled section - sometimes there's lamb chop or satay. my recommendation - dip the bread into their chicken curry or beef rendang or beef stew. if you love chilli dipped; they had sambal belacan gilling. sambal cincalok and tangy sambal padi. eat with seafood cold platter - shiok sekali! salads are served too. desserts - amazing. must taste their durian pengat. ice cream - local flavours like yam & coconut.their aim is peranakan inspired. they achieved it. if you want try buffet in singapore, try this. they are under rated but they are a gem. sorry, I've got no pics but pics does no justice for this place. but hey, giving this place a try is better. please note, they change a few dishes occasionally.
1
Service is attentive only when we were shown to the table. Servers are inattentive and unfamiliar with the menu. Waited for a long time and the place is hardly considered crowded. Came with 2 dishes and nothing really nice at all. Can get much better at hawker centre. When I complained of the waiting time and asked to cancel the order, waitress said will get it ready in 5 minutes. More than 15 mins passed and nothing came. So disappointed and in fact rather annoyed by the level of service we received
3
Food was generally very nice, good selection but the place had a lot of noisy children and lacked any sort of music.
5
Staff was very courteous. Food selection was not bad at all. Atmosphere was great. Overall an excellent experience.
5
We love the food there and the service is really good.Thanks to Mary Jane for helping us and suggesting to us the best food there.
5
Nice service & yummy food. Thanks for the excellent service Mary! We sure be back...
Keep up the nice food. If can bring in more choices would be better.
5
Good foods, attentive and very nice staffs, one of them is Mary Jane. üòä. This is one of the places I can recommend to my friends and colleagues.
5
It was and excellent service given by the crew especially MJ and the team. Despite of the crowd they manage to meet our expectation. Food?that was the best food i've ever tasted i will definitely recommend to my friends this place..
4
Attentive staff with plenty of choices... Excellent pie tee..! Nice place for small and big group...
4
Love their durian pur√©e and chicken herbal soup:) came with colleagues for the year end celebration. Enjoyed their Festival ambiance and good service. Not lot of choices as others mentioned but just enough.
5
Didn't stay at the hotel but came over for their buffet for a birthday celebration. Their staffs are very friendly and attentive to our needs! I would like to praise one of their staff, Mary. She constantly helped to clear the plates and drinks off our tables to make sure we had space for more food! Food selection was wonderful! Many different types of dishes to cater to different races.
5
This is the first time i visited katong kitchen. I had breakfast buffet The food is so greatThe staff is welcoming and very accommodating Had a pleasant stayWill visit again soon Keep it up katong kitchen! ‚úåÔ∏èI want to mention one staff, named Mary Jane, she is so niceShe never stop serving usHands up on your customer service
3
Food wasn't that much & that good especially the lamb steak & seafood corner don't seem the qualities of the price for patrons paid for such pricing
5
Food was great, staff was very friendly, attentive and nice. The spread was good too. Enjoyed my time there.
5
Was very convenient for a quick bite to eat at a good price and right at the hotel. The service and food was excellent and I ate there several times.
5
Finally get to tick it off with a positive note on my go-to list. Its a small and cosy restaurant on the 4th floor of the hotel. The food is a mix cultured spread buffet and fresh seafood. Special favourites were the jelly fish salad, chempedak brulee, and durian pengat. it was heavenly the moment it got into my mouth and couldn't get enough of it. The service rendered was commendable although we didn't make any reservations. Overall, highly recommended
3
Been to this place initially on a weekday with my colleagues and like the overall ambience. It is a small place but with good space and not very crowded. So you get to enjoy the place to yourselves and even if you are in big group, you feel that the place is set just nice for a good gathering. Staff are friendly, attentive and always ready to help! Although it does not have the spread of those five stars hotel, the food is delicious - from fried rice, prawn noodle, chili crabs, Kweh Peti to Rojak. The seafood is fresh. As such, I return within less than 2 months on a weekend with my family. The weekend spread is better and the oysters are extremely fresh and delicious. They also serve fresh lobsters and crabs! Yummy and I really will go back again!
4
Tried the Sunday Brunch. We didn't make any reservations but were told that walk-in is available. Spread is very reasonable for the price; the seafood on ice even had snow crab and oysters. Staff are friendly as well. Seating capacity appears limited though. Peranakan dishes may not be very authentic to finicky tastebuds, but food quality is acceptable. I loved their chili sambal and laksa gravy; the taste and aroma of fresh chili, fragrant shallots and strong garlic with shrimp flavour really whets your appetite! For desserts we liked the lychee sorbet as well as the assortment of mousse and petit sweet treats in glass jars. Glad that we dropped by because of an unpleasant encounter at the nearby Baba Chew restaurant where the service was appalling and the food looked mediocre
4
I had called to make lunch reservations for 19 guests and Marco So, attended to my request promptly. He also followed up with an email confirmation giving me more information about the restaurant and the buffet menu. On the day of our group lunch, he was there to greet us before his shift ended and assured us his assistant will be available should we require any help.Although the buffet spread is not as wide as compared to the other hotels in town, the food is fresh and tasted better. My favourite is the Oyster Omelette with fresh, big & juicy oysters in it. The staff were all pleasant, quick in clearing your plates and filling up your water glasses.Everyone enjoyed their lunch that day. Thank you
5
A quiet and cozy halal restaurant .The dinner buffet spread served a variety of fresh mussel, scallops, crab claws, prawns and Straits Chinese / Peranakan traditional dishes. The Ayam Buah Keluak was cooked to perfection! A great dessert spread to choose from,...the Durian Pengat was addictive! Not forgetting the restaurant manager, Marco So and his service staff were very welcoming, attentive. A fantastic place for group gathering dining experience
4
Though spread of food was limited but was good.Most were peranakan and seafood was fresh.the assam prawn and ayam ponteh was fantastic.This is a halal restaurant and the dessert though not much but some are amazing like the one with mango, coconut milk and glutinous rice is nice and not too sweet.The ambience is cosy and the staff is attentive and always with a smiling face.A nice place to dine and relax during weekend.Overall good food with excellent service and affordable price
5
We were looking, on short notice, for a restaurant that serves halal food as we have a group of 20 guests from the Philippines. The restaurant manager, Marco, he picked up my call early in the morning!! (most restaurants are not even opened yet), and he personally took my reservations for that same day lunch booking very calmly. He assured me that all is well, his restaurant will be able to meet my needs. Indeed that day when we brought our guests there, we found the food was good - traditional Peranakan, the service was even better. Thank you
5
Food was good ! Crayfish , carrot cake , kweh pie tee and the dessert were among the stars. Service was great too .
Overall a wonderful experience and we will be back
4
Excellent service rendered by staff Mary, Marco and Steven. We had a dinner buffet, simple and very relaxed. Food was good and the ambiance was just nice. Thank you!
5
This is the very place for fantastic food with relaxing ambience. Generous spread of fresh crabs prawns n oysters.Their signature katong laksa ohhh la la! My crave for bread n butter pudding ended here. And their Creme Brulee was a real delightful discovery as it was mixed with jackfruit! Great claps to Chef Steven n chef Jeffry, Suet & all the wonderful staff
5
This service staff so call Mary keep smiling and giving us such great service clearing our dirty plates & asking us to help ours self for more food , I will definitely returns with more friends & family thanks to the good service & good food,...Will come again
5
Thumb up to Joey and Mary for the wonderful experience and impressive services rendered. Buffet offer a good spread of food at affordable price. My mum took the a la carte and ordered the beef noodle. For just $20, u have a huge plate of Wayu beef noodle which is delicious.However , the I felt the mutton and chicken at the buffet are too chunky and big. In my opinion, it is more appetizing if they are in smaller.
5
We went there to celebrate my mom's birthday and were spoilt for choice. My mom and dad enjoyed the seafood and.peranakan selection. I went wild with the choices of meat as well as the different peranakan dishes. Many were familiar, and the rest that weren't, were worth trying. The dessert selection as well as the ice cream section, were a hit not only with the two kids that were with us but also with all the old kids, in other words, us. The diy rojak station awoke the chef in me as I was soon making a few batches for our table. There was also kuih pie tee if one is interested. Do more there is only coffee, tea and water. Drinks like sodas were a la carte. We went there during Christmas so the theme of Turkey and such was expected. Mom was even presented with a complementary slice.of cake for her birthday, presented by all the stuff. Service was excellent. Not a single regret, just impatience to visit this delightful buffet place again. Highly recommended for any occasions. Do make a reservation in advance though so that you have a table ready for you.

What I liked:- The private dining area that is not too small or too big.- Buffet spread focus on Nyonya peranakan food, especially the Laksa and kuihs. These are the things our elder will look for, my favourite is the Kuih Pai Tee.- The buffet spread is not too many nor too little. It's all within reach.- The staff are very attentive, they will attend to your request quickly.- It's Halal - plus point for Muslim.- There's prayer room too.- The ambience of the place make it exquisite with intricate details of peranakan decor that lift up the place.What I don't like:- You have to check with Kuih Pai Tee and Ang Ku Kuih if it's available on the day you want to visit as it's there everyday.Tips: - Always check on what promotions they have currently. They have senior citizen pay 50% deal, so check on that.- Nice place to bring your mum/aunties or a girl high tea session.I went there recently for Iftar (break fast for Muslims), the standard and quality are still the same

Went on entertainer app 1-for-1 promotion.Food spread was decent (but nothing fantastic) with seafood like lobster, mussel, prawns and oyster. Hot dishes include roast beef, laksa, beef skewers and mainly Malay-style food. Self service stations consist of pie-tee, Po-piah. Taste wise was rather ok except laksa which was delicious.Service was prompt as many wait staffs available.

I stayed at the Village Hotel Katong so I get free breakfast every morning at Katong Kitchen. It's just an so so restaurant to have breakfast, halal food only, don't expect bacon or pork sausage. However, the service is great. Dirty plates very fast removed from the table. Very friendly and kind waitresses and waiters.

My girlfriend and I have been traveling around Singapore for the past few weeks on business and have been impressed with most of the places we chose to eat at. We wrongly assumed since we were staying at the Village Katong Hotel and it was so nice and had such great reviews (we love it btw) that the main hotel restaurant would be good as well. Boy, were we wrong!! We ordered chicken satay and the T-bone Lamb to share. In fairness, the satay was quite good. But to say the lamb was horrible would be a drastic understatement. We ordered it medium rare and received three pieces of lamb. One was medium rare, and the other two were very well done. The overall quality of the meat was terrible. It was incredibly (old) and very tough. It also had absolutely no flavor (spices anyone?) and the sauce it came with was very watery and didn't have a great taste. We advise sticking to the buffet and the simple dishes and avoiding anything that takes precision to cook

Wide spread of selection for lunch and dinner. Food was great. Would be good if breakfast can have different options daily especially for long stay customers.
4
Was pretty impressed with the offerings and quality of the food on offer on the buffet. Plus, at an affordable price!
Their durian dessert was a real winner.
I would go back. Good value.
3
Stayed at the hotel upstairs and tried out the restaurant, where my partner and I tried Satay and Grilled Lamb. Satay was good, served with rice, cucumber, onion and very good peanut sauce. However Grilled Lamb was below average, ordered medium rare and came out overcooked, side vegetables were soggy and fries was ok. Staffs were friendly but quite hard to flag down at times. The ambience was good and comfortable to dine in though.
5
Had a great mothers day celebration with a total of 5 mums in attendance!! The food was amazing too! 5 mums=5stars! The fried fish fillets were too yummy to be eaten and the satay, omg, its almost like m n ms that melts in your mouth! By the time i went for dessert, i was fully stuffed and the end of the meal picture taking didnt flatter myself too much either, all in all pls try Katong Kitchen and all it has to offer!!
5
Had a birthday celebration dinner here. Though the variety of food is rather limited, the quality of the food more than made up for the lack of variety.Service staff are friendly and quick to clear the plate.Though we are not allowed to bring our own birthday cake, the restaurant does provide a birthday cake slice and sang birthday song. A great place to enjoy good food in good company

I am a food lover. I am surprised that such good kitchen is a hidden in Katong area with good spread but inside this Village Katong Hotel. I am very selective what I ate but this Katong kitchen tempted me to try every dishes except beef as I dun eat beef or lamb. Strongly recommended you to eat there. They served peranakan food, especially you have to try their own signature chilli. Their bee hoon with cod fish was tasty too. Sushi were fresh, and they also have nice spread dessert that you must try. Presentation of the dessert made you water mouthing and wants to try few rounds.
3
Lunch at Katong kitchen was disappointing as the buffet spread had nothing extra ordinary to write about.Some food were cold, like the satay. The Assam prawn was bland and watery.The Ayam Buah Keluak was bad. The bubur pulat hitam was watery too. You can get better and tastier buffet spreads at some other restaurants for the same price.Only compliment for Katong Kitchen, were the restaurant staff. The chefs doing the laksa, satay and durian crepe and the manager serving and cleaning the table, Mr. Marco and his team were very pleasant and trying their hardest to encourage the diners to go for more rounds of the buffet spread. Feel sorry for them. Katong kitchen have to improve and make the food tasty if they want customers to return
5
The place may be a little hard to find as its hid away in the middle of marine parade. But its a hidden treasure I would say. Firstly its halal, so all muslim diners may add this place to your 'to-go' list. My partner and I went there to celebrate our anniversary. It was a weekday and it was pretty quiet. But that did not compromise on the food variety. I loved their desserts! It was post CNY and they had soome goodies as well. They also surprised us with a complimentary cake for our celebration. It was super delicious. I was truly impressed with the prompt services on clearing the plates and topping up the dishes. Value for money as well
4
If you are wondering whether to have their breakfast buffet or have lunch / dinner in the hotel. Well simple, go for it. The variety in the breakfast buffet is good. And there are good reviews of their food and selection for their lunch / dinner. Worth to give it a try
5
Hi i would like to share my experience about my company get to gather at katong kitchen,honestly the food was awsome everybody love it but my boss was so impressed with the server(Ms Mary) she was just outstanding she really make us so comfortable and explain about each and every food,we would like to visit again and again because of this experience

Good and nice viraiety of food wich we really enjoyed it. Warm service given by friendly staffs especially given by attentive Marry. Surely will come again with friends.....

Every meal I had was excellent, I do recommend the Lobster Laski. The western and Asian selection was great.
5
Greeted with a warm welcome by the manager Marco. Awesome service. He was really helpful in getting food for my vegetarian friend. The food had all of us going yum yum yum. We were all so full but we kept on eating and eating. Some of the really yummy ones are1. Fresh prawns 2. Muttons3. Crayfish4. Grilled potatoes5. Crackers with sambal chilli!!!! I ate so much of this6. Beef7. DIY rojak8. Kueh pie tee9. Durian Puree!!!!!!10. The desserts are all pretty gdAll in all, variety may not be as much as some other buffets but we had a really enjoyable dinner with awesome service. Highly recommended! Thank you Marco for your warm and thoughtful service.

Great alternative for company dinners who are looking for Halal certified food. During the holiday season it was difficult for us to get a reservation with the more established buffet restaurants in Singapore like Carousel, StraitsKitchen and AquaMarine.Overall the place was nice, price was not as expensive as those three mentioned above maybe the same as Chef Kwan's 1Market. The quality of food is also about the same. It also catered to our vegetarian guests with fried rice or noodle as choices
3
I live in the west side and came all the way here to try the buffet, because well, it's one of the few halal buffets in singapore. Enjoyed their dessert and local chilis! Might not come all the way here though next time.. seeing for the same price or topping up abit more, i can get a wider variety in town area.

As a couple we were given a table which we pre-reserved, right next to a huge family complete with screaming kids there for the buffet dinner. Why did some one not use their head and reserve a table in the quieter section I don't know ? We had to ask to be moved which was plain annoying. Also their menu is misleading in the description of what they are serving up under the guise of "Western " food - a turkey breast was described in the menu yet what was served up was a thin cold slice of "turkey salami" ..for a westerner this would not be acceptable so why offer it at all when it is at odds with what this restaurant is all about. Either do it properly or not at all. Luckily we were not charged but it was a great disappointment and meant we went back to our room hungry and tired - the night ruined
4
We had a company dinner here. We selected this place as it was halal certified. It is basically a buffet restaurant located at the Katong Village Hotel. The spread is reasonable. The main dishes are mainly Peranakan There are some good an unique dishes. My favorite was the lamb rendang which was really good. Having the lamb rendang with rice and sambal belacan was enough to make me happy.Dessert was good with durian pudding that gets scooped up pretty quickly. There is ice cream and a range of cakes of pudding

The lunch buffet at Katong Kitchen was the highlight of our family staycation here. We had arrived 15 minutes too early for the buffet. The friendly Ms Mary offered to help take our family photo and subsequently suggested that we explore the nearby pool to pass the time. (Turned out to be a great idea. My grandparents loved the view from the pool and had a blast at the vacant poolside gym trying out the equipment.) The lunch buffet spread itself was a good selection of largely local cuisine with some international cuisine thrown in (sushi, English beef etc). Almost every dish I tried was delicious. Even my mother, who is mildly allergic to prawns, couldn't resist the sambal prawns served at the buffet. Surprisingly, my grandparents, who repeatedly declare that they don't have an appetite for much of anything these days, continued eating until it was time to leave. There were pancakes too for diners who were still in a breakfast mood. The wait staff and manager were friendly. I'm especially thankful for Chef Vincent who visited our table. He knelt just so that he could make conversation with my grandmother at eye level and I could tell that she really appreciated it. Overall, my family and I had a lovely dining experience
5
Since I'm in Singapore for business and I'm accomodated at the Village hotel, I had, in the last days, many times the opportunity to have the lunch at the Katong kitchen restaurant. The food is very good with an infinite variety of selections not only in the main courses but also in the delicious desserts. The service is excellent at any level including also the hotel. I reccomend both restaurant and hotel to anybody, single or with family to stay and eat here

Peranakan touches can be found everywhere in this small and intimate restaurant. I especially like the decorative motifs adorning the walls and pillars but I also fancy the Peranakan displays that the restaurant has put up in strategic spots, making sure that no one forgets that this hotel lies within the heart of Peranakan culture.The international weekend buffet spread is extensive with the various food groups laid out appropriately, i.e. appetisers, main dishes, desserts, etc. Similarly, breakfast items cater to all, from local delights like char kway teow to waffles. I do wish that the carrot cake is of the more authentic variety like what one can find in a hawker centre instead of pieces portioned from a huge slab.Another feedback is that because of its floor area, some tables in the restaurant are placed too close to one another; making privacy a little non-existent.Otherwise, it is good for an enjoyable fuss-free time
4
We had breakfast during our stay and we enjoyed the setting the cuisine and the smiling service we were offered at this place. They have lunch and dinner buffets which I believe are equally good.
5
We had a great lunch buffet, with local cuisines such as Satay, Laksa and Oyster Omelette. The Peranakan spread was good, it was suitable for entire family.
3
Reasonable spread for lunar new year. There are a variety of dishes like the sweet cake dish, big fried prawns and variety of Chinese New Year dishes. The price was rather steep though maybe due to the second day of Chinese New Year.
4
Visited 4x since the revamp. Good & ample selection of menu. Staffs at the receiving counter were courteous & acknowledged every customer who walked in. Nothing there that we dislike....
3
The breakfast spread is just OK; I managed mostly with Omlet (make sure they dont add meat to it if you are a veggie)fruits and juices on all the days. The Indian items (since Indian community has its presence here) were totally missing.Never dared to have dinner though
4
Had buffet lunch for 4 at Katong Kitchen.Katong Kitchen serves up a Perenakan style buffet with some additions of seafood, waffles and ice cream. The restaurant is a little small so there's not much of a variety.Service by the wait staff were impeccable with smiles on their face.Due to the size of the restaurant, seating is a little cramp in the main area. However, we requested for a change of table to the side court whereby it's much more spacious.All in all, I would definitely return to Katong Kitchen in future
5
Was there on a Friday night - food has no question about it - love the prawn Mee - kueh pieti - what is impressive is the service !! And the dessert was the one that have us coming back many times !! Durian penyat , yummy yummy / thank you Gregory and team / excellent job and will sure to return with joy again - cheerz
5
The restaurant is situated at East Village Hotel in Marine Parade. My family and I have been there twice. There's a wide choice of Halal food from freshly bake bread and butter (for starters), cold seafood, Japanese food, salads, local dishes, desserts, roasted chicken and lamb chop, and their roasted beef. Coffee and tea is complementary but you can always try their local mixes of drinks.The ambiance in the restaurant is pleasing and their customer service is top of the line
5
A regular patron of their buffet lunch and dinner. It is good to know that their restaurant is Halal certified so you can bring your Muslim friends there to dine. Their choice of seafood is fresh and there is a variety of dishes on offer. Must try dishes at their buffet include: Ayam Buah Keluak, their soups (on rotation), roasted duck, Spanner crab, Mee Rebus and their dessert spread. The service staff are attentive and take the trouble to remember your name. Thank you Gregory, Dicky and team

My friends and I dined at the restaurant for its halal buffet dinner. The variety and taste of the food was just average. It did not meet my expectations. The decor was simple and the setting was cosy. However, what made it enjoyable was the good service we have received. The servers were warm, friendly and polite. The manager on duty that night (15th April 2015) was very attentive. During the dinner, I accidentally dropped a fork and within seconds, she came to me with a new one although she was stationed at the cashier counter, a distance away. That's really impressive and appreciated. This is indeed service with a heart in a food and beverage business. Keep it up and I hope the management would recognize, affirm and reward its staff fairly. Thank you

Best array of food...from cold section to the traditional kueh...A MUST try are bread butter pudding n the pengat durian!! Best service!!!

The Food was excellent and had a full stomach and prices were also reasonable. This place was near our Hotel Roxy Mercure.

We had spent a couple of days at this hotel at a retreat, and decided to come back with my in laws for the buffet dinner. The 50% off seniors was a very attractive offer, and the spread was decent. In terms of food variety, its not the most impressive I've ever seen, but the food quality is of a very high standard. The restaurant specializes in Peranakan food, and the belachan was certainly true to its roots; definitely recommended, as is the ayam buah keluak! Service was excellent, the service crew of David, Jack and Letchu under Greg's management was always attentive to clear away plates, and be on hand to offer anything else that was needed. (they were that good that I bothered to note their names!) Very friendly service without being intrusive, and very professional, certainly a credit to the organization, and they really took pride in their establishment

Went there for the buffet dinner in late December. Was very impressed with the wide selection of seafood. I loved the oysters! Service was great and Gregory, the Assistant Manager, was very friendly and helpful. Overall, enjoyed the meal and it was great value for money
5
I had my bdae celebration on valentine day! The varieties & setup of the food were amazing. The ambience was perfect. The music that tagged along was nice. Special credits to Geogory & Stephanie.The crowd was busy, but they never failed to smile all the way through. The service was excellent. I will come again & again! Thankyou to the wonderful team esp Geogory & Stephanie on 14-02-15! Such a memorable valentine & birthday celebration
4
Staff really friendly and warm, made us feel at home.Quality, rather than variety, is more attention to food, The more memorable ones are the crayfish, lamb stew, grilled lamb, creme brulee. Deserts are generally excellent (I am the son of a pretty talented baker).There isn't any prayer rooms around, mildly surprising considering the majority of customers are Muslims. Wished there were more variety to the food for the 58 per pax spending, although it could be argued that this was spent on the exceptional service.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this restaurant
5
Had dinner with family at this cosy establishment. Good spread of delicious Asian and International cuisine. Try the grilled lamb. It's fantastic. Service is top notch too. Kudos to Wardell who served us. He is very friendly and helpful. Overall, value for money and fantastic food and service
3
Went there for a birthday celebration of mine. Unfortunately, not much of variety and there's a section for gado gado or rojak but the gado gado gravy is not hot or even warm at all. The only good food that's nice are the grilled prawns and desserts
2
We came here for the breakfast buffet on a sunday. The spread does not have much variety but more importantly the food did not taste very good. E.g. The eggs were cooked to order but still tasted horrible. Most of the time if you eat breakfast at a hotel, if the eggs are cooked to order, its usually good, so this was a first for me. The bread was soggy.... I can go on but anyway to sum it up, its not worth it. Even their sister restaurant at Changi Village Hotel is much better

Katong Kitchen is situated in the Village Hotel Katong (Marine Parade). Enjoyed a well prepared buffet for dinner. Breakfast is excellent. All staff very friendly, especially Elmer is helpful

Excellence services by Restaurant Manager, Dicky Teh.
On my first visit I was immediately impressed by the professionalism of Dicky.
Well done!

Not much range. Food so so. Fresh seafd available with substantial rangeDrinks only coffee, tea or plain waterDessert not much range. no ice cream Price $58 per head for wkend. Considered not worth the amount paid.If u are not into seafd, should just go penang culture buffet at wdlands causeway pt.

Had a dinner buffet with my family and my children friends, to celebrate my eldest son n younger daughter bday.We gad a great time, enjoying the foods n also the services provided by David, Greg n all the team. It was a surprised to us when they even gave us complimentary cake for my two children! Thumb up for their good job...we great appreciated it n will come back again... its so unforgettable moments...

This is my second visit since jun14, I love the kua pie tee and laksa. They have change some of the food, different from previous round. Service from the crew are excellent, attentive and friendly. Overall experience was good. I was given a feast card so I could have discount for my next visit. But till now cannot get it activated, call the given number but always left my number and never able to get support. I do receive call from Far East but always at a wrong timing. I wonder when will they resolve my card member problem. Maybe too many issue and no one have time to get back

Went for dinner buffet on 9th July 2014 for breaking fast with family.It is situated at Level 4, Village Hotel Katong (opp Parkway Parade). They just got their halal certification recently. Warm lovely decorations of Peranakan. Nice food especially Black Pepper Crayfish, Ikan Sambal and Beef Masak Merah. Lamb Chop is delicious too. Fresh lamb. Self service kueh pietie and rojak as well. Limited selections of sushi. Cold seafood available too such as prawns, clams, gonggong, crabs, mussels. Roasted Chicken & Grilled Fish is fantastic. Simply love the fresh grilled fish. Limited selections of fresh salad. Not much tho. Pasta salad, nyonya achar is available.Beautiful and yet tasty desserts, mostly Nyonya kuehs such kueh lapis nyonya. They do have small bites carrot cakes, cheesecakes, chocolate cakes, bread and butter pudding and other desserts too. Oh..do try their Pengat Durian. They had to topup 3 times! Really fantastic even tho I am not durian lover. Hot tea & black coffee is available too. Excellent service from the team such as Jeffery, Sheng Yi,Dicky, Lilian and the rest too. On the other hand, do not expect their selections as much as Straits Kitchen or Carousel. No harm visiting and give them our support

My and my family went to try out Katong Kitchen for dinner as it was my mom's birthday. I had alias with Mr. Elmer prior to my booking date. When i came, i was greeted by Mr. Greg who informed me that Mr. Elmer has already knocked off from work. Mr. Greg was well-informed of my 'surprise' plan for my mum. They even prepared a cake with the wordings of Happy Birthday and sang a birthday song for my mum! Really wonderful service from them. Not to forget Ms. Stephanie who was also working and helping out with the 'surprise'. Really thankful to make a surprise a successful one and great teamwork for Katong kitchen! Will definitely recommend guest to eat here with exceptional staff service and good food!am looking forward to their Ramadhan buffet:

We enjoyed our lunch at the Village Hotel Katong restaurant: the range of food was very good, the staff were most friendly and we were given a special senior rate. The restaurant was full as it catered for a large school reunion group who created a very lively and happy atmosphere.

My sister recommended dining here and we were glad we did. Even an aunt who is particularly picky about her food was impressed with the selection available.Located on the fourth floor of Katong Village Hotel, formerly Paramount Hotel, this eatery has a wide, interesting and delicious buffet spread. Dishes include seafood (fresh crab and prawns), roast beef, grilled shortribs and prawns, as well as local delicacies such as laksa, Chinese rojak (a salad) and kway pitie. There were also other Asian dishes like Thai beef salad, tempura prawns and vegetables, fried rice and noodles, and sushi. Dessert featured a wide spread again, ranging from local Nyonya/Peranakan cakes to cheese cakes, durian pengat, Thai mango with glutinous rice and fruits.Service was exceptional. Used plates were whisked away immediately and requests for tea and coffee etc were taken care of straight away. To top it off, there was a special promotion where three diners only pay for two. Currently, adult diners are charged S$46 +++. So do ask them when making a reservation what other promos they might have. On the other hand, reservations might not be needed as not too many people know of this buffet spread yet. But it is certainly worth a visit
3
The dinner buffet was quite an array of food - from sushi to laksa to anything local.There were not many patrons when I visited the restaurant hence food were aplenty until it closes... which was good i would say.However, i really need to highlight to the management/restaurant staff that it is ultimate important for them to display the correct tags against the food. And please do spell check on the food mentioned too. For instance - Ikan Pedas was displayed as Ikan Pedah? Opor Ayam became Opar Ayam? The cold cuts section displays was the worst, I would say. They were mismatched and a local like me had a hard time to figure out the dishes. One best example was the Green Mango Salad - the tag displayed with a seafood tag! Maybe the Captain can do a round check before opening the restaurant
