so many resto in novena. dropped by curry times and the food is heavenly! price is not so expensive! try their chicken curry, prata, dry laksa.. the drinks are varied and taste superb as well with super friendly staff. the place is not noisy too!

Curry was on the sweet side but still quite yummy! No coconut milk so hopefully this is a healthier choice! Can change to brown rice with no additional cost. Set lunch at $9.90nett.

Best curry chicken place in Singapore !You can have it with brown rice or white rice or bread rolls.This is one of many outlets.Large variety of spicy local Peranakan dishes.The fish balll soup with cabbage is also tasty.There are some creative dishes such as dry laksa noodles.Stewed beef tendons with rice / noodles is also recommended.We can refill curry gravy .and the people serving are very friendly and efficient .There are a variety of local desserts and beverages to choose from.The waitresses‚Äô uniform and ambiance give you a nostalgic feeling of being back in timeIn the 60‚Äôs .Take-away curry puffs and curry buns wth different fillings bursting at the seems are available at the front of the restaurant.The price is value for money

Curry Times brings back memories of Singapore from the past. The nostalgia makes for a homey feeling. The menu fits the era and is satisfactory. True to the theme, the tables and stools are lined up side by side, leaving no room for privacy in conversations

I have dined here for several times during my visit to S'pore this year. The last visit was in November 2017. The restaurant has expanded since my last visit in September. It looks brighter and more spacious. Though the seating is so and so, yet waiters and waitresses are polite with good manner. Certainly the quality of food maintains good standard, curry chicken in soup together with deep fried fish filet and bean curds. Most Mala native foods are served. In particular, the dessert: Coconut with Aloe Vera and Ice Jelly is recommended. The juice comes with slices of coconut, aloe vera and jelly refreshing our spirit after a long day travel, or work.

We ordered the prata when we read on the menu that you 'can't go wrong with the plain prata'. When it arrived, we knew that it's darn wrong! It was flat with no layers and based on the clean edges, it is most likely a FROZEN prata!! It's amazing that they can serve up plain prata such as this. Other than that, you really cannot go wrong ordering the Assam Fish and Signature Curry Chicken. Just avoid the plain prata unless you have a gnawing craving that has to be satisfied there and then...if not just get a pack of frozen pratas from the supermarket and pan fry them yourself
4
First time trying out their signature curry dishes. We ordered both Chicken & Assam Fish curry. I prefer Chicken over the Fish and I had prata to go along. Curry was thick and juicy and portion was generous for one person.My wife ordered coffee chendol and I had the Yingyang drink.We enjoyed our lunch very much and will come back for other dishes in the menu

This is not the first time I eat at Curry Times, Novena Square. I have been there on many occasions with my friends for lunch as well as afternoon tea break. I must admit, quality of food, curry dishes, prata, buns and array of local delicacies are consistently good. Just like home-cooked taste. I ordered a few dishes for lunch, signature curry chicken, fish head curry, mixed vegetables, fried chicken wings, Ngoh Hiang and enjoy every single food. Service is fast, well organised and pleasant staff. However, if you are alone on weekdays then go for the quick set lunch under $10, signature curry chicken comes with rice or loaf, vegetables of the day and one choice of drink, kopi, teh or drink of the day. Good value for money. As for my recommendations, go for their curry dishes authentic and spicy , savoury Ngoh Hiang, fried chicken wings and lovely desserts.The place has a charming heritage atmosphere, marble table tops, wooden chairs, bird-cages hanging from the ceiling, old kitchen utensils, tingkats, fancy bowls on wall shelves where diners can relax and enjoy their meals. Lastly, restaurant is owned by Old Chang Kee, famous for curry puffs and halal certified too

Great place to get your curry cravings - prata, bread or rice with chicken curry. Service is good, the team is attenttive.
3
The food range had few surprises or delights, and some were a little bland. The service however was sometimes enthusiastic.
4
My favourite dine in place when i crave for curry. They serve thick and rich curry taste and not those watery type of curry. My favourite is curry chicken with rice or curry with prata... the place will pack during peak hours though!
4
Curry chicken is great. Also provide small snacks to munch on while waiting or after dinner. Simple old school biscuits with sugar icing.
5
Great place to get some yummy light snacks and drinks while waiting for our First Coach bus back to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Reasonable pricing and fast service with good variety of food. We have always come to this place before leaving Singapore. Velocity provides free wifi so it's a good place to chill out as well. Traditional food and dishes. Great for family and friends.

A nice retro cafe for family meals. Most of the dishes we ordered did have a "home cooked" flavour, especially the ngo hiang, which had crispy light skin and fresh fillings. The only disappointment was the chicken curry. Not quite the lemak taste we expected as the broth is diluted and flat
3
Stopped over at Curry Times while searching for some light afternoon tea bites. The waitress also did a good job waving in and recommending the curry bun. The eatery is operated by the Old Chang Kee Group.For friends unfamiliar with this F&B company, their rise to fame was the result of their curry puffs. The old scene of Singaporean Chinese "espanadas" emerging golden brown in large woks of oil in Rex have transformed into kiosks dotting malls around Singapore.So I assumed the curry bun would bear the same aromatic, rich and tangy curry that made the puffs so popular. The bun was a soft and sweet but the small dollop of potato, chicken and curry mixture wasn't much to go around. It tasted like the result of mechanization.Still an amicable afternoon tea snack if you wash it down with the "kopi"
2
The wait staff are all rooted at the entrance.After we were seated and served our orders, we had to wave like windmills to get their attention. Absurd.At 2 pm, when 6 of us dined there, they were already out of their chinchow drink (glass jelly drink).A promotional display, prominently placed on our table, announced:$19.90 nett only, Special Set Meal - at least 30% savings. When we ordered this set meal, we were told - "It is for dinner only". Exasperating.The food and drink we finally settled for was nothing to be excited about.Mention must be made of their ice kachang.It is served on a flat plate. This makes it difficult to consume when the melt down starts. One has to slurp it off the plate. And it is very very very sweet. Which leaves the remaining ice bland and not worth eating. See pics.The dining package was terrible. Only the outlet's breezy displays offered some redemption. Don't worry about service. You won't get much of it

I wrote a review for CurryTimes before, this time i tried something delicious again. I was thrilled by the Dry Laksa here! You can have the thick meehoon or kuay tiaw, your choice! It was so tasteful, lot of meat, prawn and big plate that can fit two smaller eaters! I have been keep going back for the same food
3
Good place to try the Singapore classic "Prata" which is a Malaysian-style layered bread (similar to Indian parata) served with a chicken curry gravy. (Wish the menu told you that, as we separately ordered chicken curry to go with it). Service was indifferent; it was crazy busy and loud - tolerable if you're here for a snack not trying to have a serious, quiet conversation
5
I can't explain why i love the food on this restaurant so much.
When i'm back to singapore next time. This is the first meal i want to eat!!!!
5
It's always packed during lunch time. The buns are nice. Good service and good food. Traditional coffee is a bit thick to me.
3
" first time visit out of convenient. Food taste are average, price a little on the high side. Overall, satisfied. Nothing so special about. Maybe should try other main course next time".
4
Our first visit & it passed the taste test with flying colors! üëçüèº The laksa goreng, fish maw soup & ngo hiang were all great.
4
We were staying over the road at Oasia. We had just landed and wanted some local food. We were not disappointed.
The curries were really nice with lovely flavours. Can not complain for the price with friendly staff
3
I have tried the curry bun and it really tasted awesome especially it is served hot. Yummy!Ordered the dry laksa and I will give it a thumb down as its taste is flat. The greatest disappointment must be the Assam fish head. The fish head portion is really small about 150g of meat for $29.90 and the worst is that the taste of the fish and the Assam sauce do not mix to bring out a well blended signature dish. I decided to go to Alexandra market to have another fish head to satisfy my craving for good fish head.

I had been here for few times, they server local food with slightly higher price, probably because they are consider restaurant. However, the food here normally do not disappointed me much, so my experience is positive.Dry Curry Chicken - nice but slightly less meatCurry Chicken - I love the curry gravy a lot, thick and greatSambal Frried Fsih - overall is good but when it goes with rice, it is a bit dry, so best have some curry to go with it. Best for meThere is lunch set menu where it is around $9.9 with today's vege(small plate) and a drink. I think it is still quite worth it
5
We stayed across the road at the Oasia Novena and so the quick walk from there (or the train station) makes this an even easier pick. Loved the curry buns (careful, they're big!) and the curry chicken proper was just outstanding. Too that off with some delicious hot roti and you've got a cheap and tasty meal that can't be beat.
4
This restaurant is tucked at a corner of Novena Square, which makes it a little harder to find. But the food is good, the price is affordable, and I liked that it wasn't crowded (because of its location I believe), which made it a great meeting place over lunc

I went to the westgate branch and ordered the fish head curry, chicken curry with roti prata, curry bun, and chendol as dessert. I concur that their curry dishes are very very good, so with the curry bun and the chendol. The roti was average, as it was crispy and unfortunately crumbling in certain portions. The winner is the curry dishes and should be this restaurant's hero.there is a huge sign of excellent tripadvisor reviews displayed unashamedly at the entrance. Amusing at first, but since it was a selection of only the good, and thus was not a plus due to bias. I would rather see them show a tripadvisor sticker with their overall review score than what was displayed
4
Simple meals at mid-range prices. The curry chicken and soy chicken is nice. The service is quite fast and usually standard is quite good.
4
It's a must visit restaurant for curry lover when visiting Singapore.
The serving is fast and the place is clean, the price is very fair considering the quality of the foods serve at this restaurant.
5
Stumbled across this restaurant whilst walking near our hotel. Food was excellent and served very quickly. They have a menu that you tick what meals and drinks you would like - the menu is quite extensive.
5
I have been there many times. Cheap and good in the mall with aircon place. One prata about $2, prata is crunchy served and curry is spicy enough and delicious. I have tried the curry chicken bun too, love it. Last time I tried curry dry noodle, the curry not much, I think they trying to fit everybody's taste bud. Curry laksa, rice are good to try. Love the deco of the shop. Old school uniform servers, decorated with old Chinese bowls, cups all around the shop. Service is good and fast too. Love this place
5
We took our elderly mother to this restaurant at Westgage shopping mall and we all agreed the traditional food, service, and atmosphere all lived up to our expectations.We ordered traditional food such as 'roti prata', local coffee (Kopi - O), and spring rolls. The most amazing treat was those cute traditional biscuits (with colourful sugar on top), which are stored in a huge container, and the biscuits are free. Though I didn't try any, the display of these sweet biscuits was very heart-warming. Our little nieces all helped themselves to the biscuits. It was a delightful restaurant, and its nostalgia theme was just appropriate
4
They are famous for their curry puffs, so just head for the curry + rice. The rest of the dishes are hits and misses.Prices is not cheap though. Probably mid range.Dinner for 2 person, 3 dishes + 2 drink came up to about $40

Having been to Curry Times at Westgate, I find the authenticity of these reviews highly questionable, particularly given how a printed board of the positive reviews from Tripadvisor is so proudly displayed at its frontage. The recurring commenendations of the less-than-impressive oldern decor is one of the factors that easily raises the brow. Not to mention that the interior design also results a noisy, food-court-like ambience. This is further sullied by the fact that you have to share tables with strangers, which would be fine if not for the fact that their prices are sufficient to be counted for as restaurant pricing, and one would expect some family privacy to be in order. My family of 5 had to share a round table with 1 lady whom we did not know, I'm sure she must have felt pretty uneasy given how she fixed her eyes on her phone the whole way even while eating hahaha. The food was average and some dishes such as the ngoh hiang and lady's fingers were soggy. While the laksa mee goreng that my sister ordered had an adequate portion and was unique in taste, the curry chicken rice and curry chicken prata that my brother and I ordered respectively had rather spartan portions that did not befit their prices... For example, they gave me a slice of prata which while crispy, was thinner and smaller than your average prata. In addition, it tasted slightly too doughy. It rather reminded me of instant frozen prata that one might find at an NTUC. Overall, prices at Curry Times, while not exorbitant, are not validated by the portion sizes or taste. That said, the food is still decent

I had passed their outlet in Westgate numerous times but always thought it was a place of Japanese curry which is not a favourite of mine. But a closer look this time showed that it was local Singapore food including curries.So in we stepped and saw stools instead of chairs, olden time metal bowls and plates. The decor too was of an era of yesteryears. Now this is nostalgic. And I learnt that it is operated by Old Chang Kee, the famous puff co. I had the curry fish cutlet as it reminded me of my in HK when I would eat in this cafe when I felt like something from home. To be honest, this dish was just so so, but I saw the curry chicken at a neighbouring table and it looked good. I am also going to try their "loh bak" which is small cube pork rolled in beancurd skin, then deep fried. But here, as it is a halal restaurant, they use chicken instead. I shall return; I like their concept
5
My 1st with my family but it is their 3rd visit. Simple homecooked food but taste so yummy! Is packed on weekend especially dinner time so be prepared to queue. Served food quite fast after we seated and front line staff are friendly and helpful. Very patient with kids. We are happy and glad they kept our lost and found bag for collection the next day! Great job team :) we will be back for sure

I came with my colleagues. I like the curry chicken value set lunch, which costs S$8.90 (before GST and service charge) and comes with rice/prata/bread, a side dish and a drink of local coffee/tea/drink of the day (eg kailan and honey lemon). That's pretty good value as I found four chunks of chicken and 2 chunks of potatoes in my curry bowl. I could not finish the rice and the potatoes, so small eaters might want to consider picking the prata instead. My colleague did not enjoy her soy sauce chicken noodles. It looked kind of pale and bland to me. The kailan looked dry and pathetic, but at least they came with wolfberries. One colleague found the honey lemon too sour but another one found it refreshing, so perhaps waiting for the ice to melt makes all the difference. We were so full we could not check out the desserts. This set lunch is available Mon to Fri.They have other daily value sets too, like beef brisket rice, chicken cutlet rice and oyster sauce fish fillet rice. But you have to go on the right day for your choice of set lunch.They have buns for takeaway, eg curry, coconut, in a paper box but I think the taste is so-so. Complimentary old-school cookies with colourful icing help round out a savoury meal.One thing about the place is the noise level. I am not sure if it's the design or the crowd that Curry Times draws, but it sure is a noisy place. Be sure to come early for the queue starts early. It is a popular place so be prepared to be squashed 3 to a square table.I tihnk this is a place older folks will like as the food, staff uniform and decor will bring back memories of old SIngapore and they will not have to worry about their kids breaking the bank to buy them a meal

Very good chicken curry, with extra hot sauce, offered at no extra charge. Value. Quick service. Lively local clients, who clearly do not work in Changi airport! So the locals travel to eat good food at good prices.

Very happy with the food and service here. Will be back again. The curry was authentic, their signature buns were soft n really taste good. Bobo cha cha was up to expectation too.

Still enjoy the foods and ambience after repeated visit, remind me of the good old days..... So far no dislike.....
4
Enjoy the dinner with my family last Saturday. Food is good and price reasonable. order ngoh Hiang, Chicken Curry, Fish Curry, Oyster Kai Lan and Nasi Lemark. Atmosphere and untensils used remind me of the good old days....... Will visit again and try other dishes.

Surprise, surprise.... this place is run by Old Chang Kee, and I LOVE Old Chang Kee (especially the old days of being opposite Rex theatre).Unfortunately, I'm not satisfied, and I'm not sure what I can do to make it better. The food is decent... Being a local, I can tell you that it's not amazingly fantastic but just decent. However, the price is a little steep for local food. And oh, the service is as good as a neighbourhood kopitiam... so I guess we're paying more just for the air-conditioning?Recommended: Curry Chicken Rice... at least that's what I had.Fun-facts: Read the titbits on the wall. They should really hire a copywriter to check their work

Patronized the outlet at Changi Airport Terminal 3 for the first time and fell in love with it.The restaurant's ambience immediately set you back to the 1960s, with lady servers dressed in samfu-inspired clothes and dishes served in enamel ware, which was what the average Singaporean families used back then. Food and beverage variety quite expansive and taste authentic. Portion is good too. Overall a good experience.
4
Found this place when browsing Velocity looking for Halal-certified eatery other than fastfood joints. Food and drinks were great. They were served in metallic-looking plates and bowls, just like the old times...Food price was reasonable, Halal-certified (altough not all Curry Times branch is Halal-certified as indicated in the menu, 1 out of 3 is not certified
4
Thats their tagline....best curry restaurant in singapore....Its oldstyle kopitiam set in the modern.world ...serving traditional curry dishes and desserts we all love.and missTheir curry chicken.is delish...full of herbs.and spices...just like grandma used to makeThey have a number of outlets...we.went to the one at westgate mall at jurong east mrt

I have been here several times. Its a cosy restaurant using retro crockery and posters depicting their history. "It all started with a curry puff." Ordered fish maw soup for the first time. It was a big portion and offered the home cooked taste. The nasi lemak came with a heart-shaped sunny side up (nice), chicken wing, fish cake, archar, peanuts and sambal chilli. The soya sauce chicken rice came with a egg. The curry buns were sold out today. A usual takeaway item for me. Overall, it's a nice restaurant that I hoped will stand the times.

I visit Curry Times almost every month. The Chicken Curry is yummy. It is one of the best that I've eaten in recent times. It reminds me of my own home cooked food that my Parents cooked when O was young. The Curry is not oily and has the right quantity of spices to make it tasty yet it is healthy. S bit noisy during lunch hours though. A must try for all Curry lover's.
