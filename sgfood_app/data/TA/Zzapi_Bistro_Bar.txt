I am in Singapore a lot at the moment for work and I tried this place last week as it's very near my hotel. Very friendly, two for one drinks (although the Singapore style of serving red wine chilled gets a bit of getting used to :) and great pizzas! I particularly love the burrata pizza with prosciutto and rocket. Quite delicious and just enough for one. This will be a regular haunt from now on!

As a business travel I stay in the nearby Amara hotel every 3 month. For my dinner choice I'm always going one or two times to this restaurant. The food is good and the service is great. This time I had the soft shell crab spaghetti (which was great can def. recommend) and the other night the pizza HawaÃ¯. Don't expect a large pizza as these are 7". Just take one of the excellent appetisers (I had the calamari) to go with the pizza. Conclusion yes you should try this place. Price are reasonable (as far as Singapore prices are) the food is great with a nice taste and the service is good.

We went in a group of ten for dinner and drinks. Decent range in menu to pick and mix for sharing; highlight of the visit was its very attentive service! I would accord them 6 stars for service if there were an extra one to check. When the staff (I believe it was the restaurant manager by the name of Joanne?) saw a toddler in tow, a baby chair was promptly furnished without us having to ask. As we arrived in dribs and drabs, as is typical of group gatherings, they were quick to offer additional tables to join up, again without us asking. Later, when one of our members forgot about her remaining glass from the 1-for-1 house wine promotion and gathered her bags to leave, we were impressed when the staff quickly stepped forward to remind her of her second glass. Plates were cleared regularly so we didn't have the usual bane of "plate Tetris" on a crowded table. What I appreciated very much was the staff's offer to serve iced water after she noticed my S. Pellegrino Aranciata depleted, anticipating that we were at the late stage of a meal when we wanted to talk for just a few more minutes without ordering another drink - a seemingly small but very nice touch. Meanwhile, we saw that the staff was as attentive to the other tables around us. This standard is acutely rare to come by in today's F&B scene, other establishments should definitely take a leaf from Zzapi's. The cosy service makes for a familiar atmosphere, will revisit in a heartbeat

The food was awesome served fast and prompt, but what I like most is the service. The staff is warm and so friendly, it almost feels like home. Had an awesome time with my buddies and we will definitely be back

Discovered a little gem of a place, well worth a mention to fellow visitors to Singapore. We had Oxtail with Port, followed by various dishes including BBQ Pizza, which was so good we purchased another two to takeaway the next day. Staff were very welcoming, which made the whole experience delightful

Me and my wife had the pleasure of trying this small Italian restaurant hidden within the busy streets of Tanjong Pagar that boasts authentic Italian food. I was blown away by both the quality of the food and the service that was offered to us. The food was fresh and was just the way we like it - lightly spiced with a perfect texture. We had the Penne Rigate Carbonara and The Salami and Spinach Pizza. The Pizza had a crunchy base with fresh mozzarella and the salami was really flavorful. The carbonara sauce reminded us of the one we tasted at Les Amis - A must try.All in all our experience was wonderful with smiling servers and amazing food. Highly recommended

This is the worst pizza around tanjong pagar. Caesar salad without caesar sauce and chicken... Chicken pizza with flake fish food on top and mayonnaise. Probably the best place to bring your enemy for lunch.
