worth for money with excellent food and service. They did not release the table even though I was late for 30 mins and I was given a rose by them.
5
was here for business meeting and had a 3-course meal; the boston lobster and seabads is just fabulous.
5
Had a great business meeting here but the food was awesome absolutely loved the tofu and the service was 10-10
5
Set lunch was superb with texture and flavour.
üëç
Wish there was more pork belly for our order, or free additional serving of bread üòÄ
5
Had 3 course set meal with my friends. Really enjoyed the tofu, crispy pork belly, and dessert.
Highly recommended.
5
We ordered the 8-course dinner with red and white wine. Each dish was very well designed aesthetically and the taste was very interestingly multi-dimensional. The entire course was pretty filling.
The service is top-notch; waiters/waitresses were quick to refill water/wine, pulling/pushing chairs for us etc.
5
Excellent food, great service, value for money. our party of three chose the 6 course tasting menu and two of us switched 3 of the 6 courses for different reasons. the restaurant took that without any issue and all of our courses are excellent! in addition, they do not charge for bottle water which is failry unusual for high end restaurant! definitely recommend for anyone who would like to have an enjoyable evening at a great value

As a pre Valentine treat, we visited Alma for a sumptuous 8 course dinner. Particularly great were the veggie sorbets that accompanied several of the starters and the melting Kobe beef, which while a bit small was simply perfect. Service was very attentive and not stuck up. The wine pairing was a great match, even though five glasses were a bit too much to handle. In any case a great 3 hours spent with the right companion.
5
We loved our set menu of 5 dishes with wine pairing, it was a great experience. Every dish was delicious, full of taste, refreshing and nicely presented. Produce from both East and West well chose, and creatively put together. The wine pairing was well chosen and truly complemented every dish. Service was superb, restaurant setting cosy. Definitely to be recommended and we will for sure go back
5
Had a small family dinner get together at Alma. Their service started before we could even step foot into the restaurant. The warm wide smile of the staffs made us feel so welcomed, unlike some other restaurants of similar standing. The ambiance was relaxing, made us forget about the day's stress. We had the 8-course dinner. The pre-dinner finger food was totally unexpected but much welcomed. The server took pain to explain each and every dish, which allowed us to savour the food with much understanding. Not once during dinner did we have to ask for refills of any sort as the staffs were most attentive, made us feel like royalty.Dinner itself was most exquisite, both in presentation and taste. To name a couple, I had especially enjoyed the lobster dish which tasted fresh from the ocean and the beef which melted in the mouth. A bread lover myself, the potato bread was a killer too. Just writing about them makes me salivate! The restaurant has an extensive range of alcoholic beverages too. If you are looking for a place to pamper yourself or your loved ones, Alma comes highly recommended. Bon appetite
5
Easy to made the reservation online. The food was really great, interesting and very beautiful presentation.
Excellent, attentive and cheerful service from the beginning to the end of our dinner.
Highly recommended, definitely a must visit restaurant in Singapore!
5
We had the 8 course menu for dinner, together with a bottle of wine, and we felt very satisfied after the meal. The portions were well sized and were all served at appropriate intervals. Every dish, including the snacks, were excellent. Service was also good. Definitely recommended
5
It‚Äôs sometimes a pity you have to use 200 words to describe the word ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù. Because that‚Äôs how the food should be described all other expressions would not be able to say it any better. Sensational tastes in combination with wonderful presentation and exceptional good and friendly service.

Definitely one of the longest meal I ever had . It was a pretty interesting night with a only a few tables being occupied , if you are looking for somewhere that's quiet , this is definitely the place to be but for food wise , we felt it doesn't impress us too much. Presentation wise , it's definitely a notch up there with lotsa creativity but for taste-wise , it doesn't impress us that much especially when we just came back from 2 wonderful Michelin-star meals in Korea. But as far as I know , the lunch course was more impressive according to the picky taste buds of my buddy so will definitely be back there to try the lunch menu
4
Greeted at the door by the warm and friendly hostess, lovely start to our lunch. The few service staff who provided the service were all professional and always served with a smile. Great job there on hospitality which is not common in Singapore so do keep it up please!Bread and butter is served first as with any fine dining restaurant but Alma served the warm bread on hot coffee beans in a cute little box. My starter was the scallop and yes it was yummy! The main course i selected was highly recommended by a friend- Boston Lobster with Angel Hair and yes it was superb! The dessert was average though. Ambience is lovely despite us having a noisy table beside us. Generally a very good experience and will definitely be back soon
3
Went on a Friday evening for dinner. The restaurant only had 5 other tables occupied.The food was not bad, but didn't have much WOW about it in terms of taste. However the presentation for the dishes were quite wow.Was expecting more due to Alma having 1 Michelin Star.
4
The set lunch started with really affordable price. But to keep the menu exciting enough, they have catered for more choices with reasonable top up. We were welcomed at the door by a lady who was expecting us (we made reservation), that was a fantastic greeting from a Michelin One Star restaurant
5
It was my 4th visit to the restaurant. A preferred place to have a nice private dinner. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We chose the 8-course degustation menu, paired with champagne and enjoyed them all. Will certainly be back for more!
5
We have been to Alma for dinner four times now. Each time we are thrilled with the food and the service. Most recently, we had the 6 course degustation menu. Prior to the Menu, however, we were served 3-4 snacks -- creations of the chef with amazing and inventive flavors. On the Menu itself, we loved the Hokkaido Scallop, the Mont Blanc, and Ham and Cheese. Everything else was superb as well, though. This restaurant is a treasure, and we highly recommend it

We had Lunch at Alma not long ago. We had high expectations about this Restaurant being awarded with a Michelin Star, unfortunately, it was more disappointing rather than good.Wanting to have a long fine dining Lunch experience with tasting-menu, the wait staff slowly presented us a pc of paper with business lunch 3 courses, not giving us any explanation nor mentioning if Alma is also offering a tasting menu.Fine with us, we did the 3 courses, thinking we can always return for dinner. You get a choice of 4 appetizers, 4 Main courses but only one dessert (not giving us more choices for selection).From 8 dishes, 5 had supplement, and you have to pay for extra Bread (very good one)Regardless all of the above, the Food tasted Excellent, but for all the good food, we could not enjoy the Lunch with the Extreme Unprofessional careless Service.Only 4 tables in the restaurant, no atmosphere at all, no engagement from the staff, not even a smile from them felt really unwelcomed. Then we ordered wine only after asking for the List. Again a loose pc of paper-selection came, not appealing at all, we had to ask again if there was a wider list for selection. Again, the wine list selection which was presented after asking is Excellent but the way the service staff presented or not presented at first was Disturbing. There was a suited gentleman, we assume the Sommelier or Restaurant Manager, was very chatty with another table, but when he brought the wine to us, not a smile, not a word, placed the wine in front of my partner‚Äôs face, open- give to try and service- again we felt unvalued.Also the flow of the service was so fast that the mains arrived while we still had our appetizers. Clearly a massive letdown.Coffee included at the end, Nespresso it is and the check came prompt to the table as if they need us out of here.We enjoy going out and experience great food, and Service has to play huge in this.Just a thank you but no more engagement expected after this Disappointing Experience
5
amazing food . inspiring chef. great service.
love the ham and cheese. beautiful wines. amazing service. good value. chef is inspiring. but the restaurant needs a little facelift. BUT definitely worth a visit
5
It‚Äôs hard to imagine a Michelin rated restaurant exceeding expectations and yet Alma has managed to do so. The service, wine selection, ambiance, and exquisite and artful cuisine made for and extraordinary experience. This was my third time here.
5

My husband and I had the pleasure of celebrating our anniversary here while we were visiting Singapore. It was a recommendation from my mother's cousin who is a local and had been to Alma on a few occasions. From the start with welcoming us to the restaurant, to the end of the evening, the service was professional, courteous and friendly. Each of the staff that we were in contact with were introduced to us, all with warm smiles. We had the pleasure of having a pre-dinner drink out on the patio with our appetizer. We didn't feel too rushed and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Once we were finished, we were escorted into the dining room where we enjoyed an exquisite meal. Every course was beautifully plated; the creative combination of ingredients and flavours were simply superb. Each mouthful was savoured. The wines we had were also very good. I was really pleased with the selection that was offered and definitely was not disappointed with my choices. The complimentary glass of champagne and the personalized desserts were certainly a nice touch that was well appreciated. This was a wonderful experience and we both would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a special night out. It is a bit of a splurge, but worth every penny
5
We just recently brought both sets of parents to Alma and were happy to find that the quality of the food and service were still as enjoyable as our last visit over 8 months ago.You can choose between a 6 and 8 course degustation menu that for good or bad have no overlapping dishes. For the math impaired (like myself) - that‚Äôs 14 unique dishes that are offered each season to try out. Price-wise Alma is more modestly priced compared to its Michelin-starred brethren, though even at higher prices, I‚Äôd still go here vs other similar places.This visit, my hands down favorite was the ‚ÄúHam and Cheese v2.17‚Äù - a modern twist with crispy suckling pig and manchego on toasted brioche. The rest of the courses were all adventurous in their combinations, and the snacks and petit fours still demonstrated the level of effort and care paid to each dish.A special shoutout goes to Saravana, one of the best hosts on this island. It‚Äôs rare to have a level of service that is attentive, friendly, yet not overbearing. Bonus points for having also remembered our last visit to Alma.In summary: great value for money, seasonal menu, and excellent service by Saravan and team. Would recommend for business meals and the occasional fancier night out
5
I had dinner here with my friends, and it was stunning experience. Service staff are very professional and friendly. Restaurant setting is elegant, and environment is quiet and lovely. The food was awesome, I will definitely recommend this place to my friends :
5
Dinner at Alma was a stunning experience. The posters of birds displayed on the walls give Alma a "natural feel", and the staff are well-trained, friendly, attentive and very accommodating. They knew the dishes served very well, and explained the highlights of every course served (where the main ingredients came from, what was unique about the dish, what wine would go well with each course, etc.).There are two items on the menu: the six-course dinner, and the eight-course dinner. If I remember right, there were not overlaps between the six- and the eight-course menus, which means that you could dine twice at Alma without repeating the main courses.Dinner started with bread, freshly baked and served warm with very good butter (so good that I had to ask for a second portion). After that came the toast (made to look a lot like kaya toast, popular in Singapore and Malaysia), and served authentically in a paper bag (with black pebbles used to keep the toast warm). I cannot remember what was spread on the toast, but it was really delicious!The eight courses came after the toast. Every course was unique, surprising (in a good way), tasty, and very pretty. I'm not a seafood lover, but I enjoyed the scallop at Alma. I like steak, and the Wagyu beef was excellent. Dinner ended with a dessert (called Brick-in-the-Wall because it was shaped like a Lego brick).If you're into fine dining, Alma is definitely the place to go in Singapore. The setting is great, the food is excellent, the people are friendly and welcoming, and the overall experience, outstanding
5
I had to bring my 7 month old son and was a little apprehensive as I knew some fine dining establishments don't take too well to young kids. Turns out I didn't have to be.The staff was very accomodating; they apologised for the lack of ramps for the stroller, helped me with the stroller, gave me a bigger table as they anticipated the need for space, and were very friendly to my baby - smiling at him whenever they passed by. One of the staff even took him off my hands when I was struggling to calm him and eat at the same time. All in all, the service exceeded my expectations and I had a great time
4
This restaurant does not have ala carte menu and offers 2 types of set-menu only. Both are interesting and very good for food quality and presentation, except that I find the food is a bit salty as far as I am concerned. Service is superb and atmosphere is excellent. It offers fine dinning experience without charging very high prices
5
We had a blast! Each dish that came out blew us away with the novelty and taste. The price is totally worth it for the creativity and quality of both the kitchen and service staff! Other friends saw the photos and made a reservation! You should too ;-
4
service was impeccable.the price per pax was reasonable.but comments recd was that the beef and pork, the main dish were only so so
3
Decent quality food with nothing to shout out for. Every dish was average and forgettable. There are better non Michelin starred options available at this price range.
4
Normal food. Interesting presentation of bread. Personally didn't really like the lemon dessert. abc
4
Good and value for money. Food experience was fantastic and tasty. Restaurant environment was having a pleasant comfort feeling
5
We wanted to try a different restaurant from the usuals we go to and saw this on trip advisor. The whole experience, from making reservation (very prompt), entering the restaurant (my Friend did not know we are visiting this place and hence had shorts and sports shoes - we were not turned away by staff which I really appreciate) and the whole dining experience (ambience, service and food).We had the six course menu which was enough - we are feeling full before the main. Each dish has a different perspective - exciting n interesting combination of taste and Flavours. Cooked perfectly. Served in such a beautiful setting. Loved the foie gras, suckling pig and Pigeon (I do not take beef hence they swapped it) the most (the other dishes are nice too). Also enjoyed the snacks and petite four which has a bit of fusion incorporating local Flavours. Price seems high but considering the quality of food and service and surprises each dish brings, this is worth it - We had a great evening! Recommend this to anyone who wants to be wowed.
5
The business set lunch was a bargain with its price. The star was the Chilean Seabass which was cooked to perfection. Usually never have high hopes for fish dishes in restaurants, but this one clearly is an exception
5
The food was amazing and very creative, the Chef showed his talent with stunning flavour that you did not expect, having visited Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athenee in Paris last week this Chef prepares to a higher level and the tastes he created were far past Alain Ducasse's current offerings, a must visit Restauran
5
went there for my husband birthday. the set lunch pricing was competitive for a michellin star establishment. the lobster and scallops appetizers were both very good, as for mains, the seabass is definitely a must order. the pasta was abit of a let down though. i wish they had options for desserts just like the mains and appetizers. all in all, would recommend this place and would return again,
3
The appetizers were tantalizing! Our favourite being the crispy tofu, which has all the taste elements aligned in harmony. The Boston Lobster angel hair pasta was alittle too spicy though with the chilli padi; sweetness of the lobster chunks was overpowered completely. We were looking fwd to the desserts, but to our dismay, they didn't take off
5
Excellent lunch provided by the team lead by GM, Giuliano and Chef Haikal as my guests had a great time to this hidden gem. Clients were surprised with the value over the quality served. Most important is the meals were filling compared to some European fine restaurant.... I'll be back...
4
Before serving the meal they serve a few of one-bite food which is very unique.
Each serving is being explain by the server the food ingredient making the tasting more interesting.
4
Usually empty but great value, perhaps Michelin rating scares off the crowds. Really nice place to enjoy a business lunch with a very well selected wine menu. The Business lunch is very good value.
4
One michellin star restaurant at affordable lunch price. Definitely worth a try. Food was nice and good quality.
5
Nice lunch for wife‚Äôs birthday. The service was quick, suitable for weekday lunches.
Service was attentive and friendly.
Portions were not too big but suitable for us and importantly great quality and taste.
Some really good wine varieties. Highly recommended.
2
Muddled and confused flavours. Odd combinations that failed to resonate. Alarmingly overseasoned as though prepared by an under-skilled and over-confident cook. Complicated and unpalatable preparations wrought into a degustation format. Come here if you have money to spend and are satisfied with skin-deep sophistication.
4
Very pleasant with nice environment and hospitality of employees makes the whole dining experience an enjoyable evening.
4
The food is beautifully presented and plated. Every single one of them. I had dinner there with the 8 course degustation. My favorite remains to be the first snack which is served like a kaya toast but has foie gras inside. Surprisingly wonderful mix of savory and sweet.I found that with the quality and amount of food, there is good value fo rmoney. THe wine is also surprisingly cheap which makes dining all the more enjoyable as we can order more than 1 bottle without feeling too much pinch on the pocket.The only critique I have is on the ambience and decor of the restaurant. The wine shelves are wonderful but the rest of the restaurant looks dated. I also don't understand the birds of america posters that surround the restaurant. They make the place look cheap
5
Just celebrated our wedding anniversary with dinner at Alma. Was looking for a good Spanish/European restaurant and chanced upon this restaurant (yes i know it has a Michelin but it's certainly not as well known as some of the other starred restaurants). What a find! The food was excellent from the starting "snacks" all the way to the desserts. We chose the 8 course which included lobster, crab and pigeon. My all time favorite had to be their version of the Kaya Toast, which was a creamy slab of foie gras terrine, surrounded by 2 crisp sweet wafer-like squares. I could have had 10 of those instead of my entire meal! The lobster and crab dishes were also excellent. Next time, we will go back to try the 6 course as well as probably the lunches (which seem to be of good value given the other reviews on Tripadvisor).Special callout to Guiliano, the manager with the mostest. He provided excellent service, with a great mix of making sure we were happy, whilst also being funny and entertaining too. The other staff were also very friendly and made our experience an excellent one.We will defnitely be back.P.S. if you're coming from outside the hotel, it's next to the stairs to the right of the main entrance (i.e. you dont need to go to the lobby to get to the place)
5
Special thanks to the team! A good restaurant is not only what is on the plate, but how you get it served. With attention, kindness and courtesy! And the dishes were just perfect! CU for the next menue
5
Although there were 30+ from our group, the service was efficient and good. The staff were warm and very attentive.The starter was Chipotle Japanese strawberry. A rather unusual dish but nevertheless I was surprised by the pleasant flavour. The Hokkaido scallop came in tiny pieces but was very tender, moist and delicious, The Chiliean Seabass was my main course. What can I say - the fish was tender, chew-able and fresh. The sauce that came with it was excellent. It added an unique and distinguish flavour. Definitely worth a second try for this dish. My friend took the Angus beef as the main dish. I was told it was excellent. The lemon dessert Umeshu was unusual. I can see a lot of preparation work was done for this dessert.If you are a big eater, it will be better to order more food
5
Had to catch up with few friends over lunch and we enjoyed the food as much as the company! Great ambience and impeccable food presentations.
5
My first visit to Alma. I must said every dishes gave me a surprise to my taste bud. I really love the food and service. Been a long time that I felt "this taste so good and special"! Two thumbs up! I will be back!
5
We went here for a birthday celebration and enjoyed every morsel. Great tasting menu and superb service. Very impressed
5
We recently had the pleasure to dine at this fine establishment,the atmosphere,food and service were impeccable ,tasting menu was delicious,wine pairings well thought out,i highly recommend Singapore residents and visitors to experience the delicious food and great service, hats off to the chefs and all of the staff that made this a memorable evening
5
Wonderful ambience, relaxing and classy, not stuffy and stiff.Staff are superb - efficient, effective and do not interrupt guest experience. Not pretentious.Food quality is top notch - European with Asian touch. Very nice for lunch.Gorgeous selection of top wines.Beautiful Private Dining Room with wine cellar.Great value. Highly recommended
5
My friend and I had an amazing night here.The 6 course dinner was spectacular. My favorite are sea urchin, foie gras and ham & cheese version 2.17. And all the pre-course are well-prepare and delicious too. I love the foie gras Toast.The drinks are fabulous as well. We had champagne, red wine and whisky. I can't wait to come back for the whisky. It's the best whisky I've ever had in my life!!!I love every bite of the food here and will definitely come back for some special occasion
4
We went for the Che'f special Degustation menu and it was a very nice experience. We went for a double date to celebrate me and my friend's birthdays. The staff was top notch, providing helpful suggestions whenever needed.The food is not the "hearty" kind, it's more of the modern sophisticated fusion cuisine that uses lots of expensive ingredients, and the price speaks for it - This is a place for special occasion, not for your monthly outings. It's also a formal-wear place, which is justifiable given the decor and ambiance of the place. It is a Michelin star after all.Repeat Visit Likelihood - Good. If we decide to really splurge on some special occasion
5
My partner and I enjoyed every dish of the tasting course. Specifically, the Amadai tilefish was very crispy and light. We had never tasted such fish before.They carry a great selection of California wines. If you love wine, this restaurant is your must-go. Also, you will see very rare whiskies.
5
4 adults and a baby turn up at the last minute. 3 of us order the 6 course and one order the eight course with wine pairing. First up the food, as expected of michelin starred fine dining standards, the presentation, the ingredients, the theme are all well thought out. The chef has done a great job in showcasing his bold take on mixing flavours. A raw element is present in most dishes and some showcase the asian heritage , the deserts in tingkat are a good representation of how Singapore cuisine has evolved from it colonial roots and multi ethnic origins.I especially like the foie gras terrine and the ham & cheese brioche. The michelin star grading is not doing enough justice to fine dining establishment. The need to project a non elitist image come at the expense of frivolously graded hawker food and simple fare. like the soy sauce chicken and putien. One must remember the grading is given based on the cuisine, ambience and service. The cuisine is not jsut about tasty food but more importantly, the representation of what the establishment is trying to convey, the dedication and excellence in culinary arts. The service encompasses attention to the finest details and ambience need to be unique. all 3 come together to give an experience.the only lacking in Alma is the ambience- lack of a view and low ceiling with a safe neutral decor doesnt do much to excite the experience. However, the cuisine and service are reflective of their one star grading. I look forward to more trips and to sum up, this is worth a visit and value for the wallet
5
Was given a surprise treat at Alma and it exceeded all expectations. We had the 8 course dinner with wine pairing. The wine pairing of light white wine to heavy red went well with the dinner menu. The pairing brought out complex flavours of every dish leaving one lusting for more. The prompt service that accompanied the meal was unhurried and well paced. A dinner at Alma is truly a time to remember...thank you for making it so.
5
Great ambience and good food. Just a bit pricey. Good set lunch. Dinner is more expensive. Good but expensive wines. Recommended.
5
Nice ambience and super friendly staff. Had a 8-course menu and totally enjoyed the food, and the wine üç∑!
5
Fantastic dinner! Delicious food with good selections of wines! Very reasonably priced considering the ingredients being used such as hokkaido scallop, miyazaki beef and generous portion.. Relaxing environment with good service. Will be coming back.
5
This is the fourth time I've dined at Alma and the Degustation menu never fails to surprise my tastebuds. The delicate combination of ingredients and garnishes brings out the unique taste of each dish. The plating of each dish is a state of art and one can sense the pure culinary passion of the Chef from the complexity of the dishes compositions. The ambiance is just right with a good list of wine to select from. The service crew is great and very knowledgeable, providing full explanation of what goes behind each dish. In summary, a quintessence experience for me. if you are driving, you might want to consider parking at Far East Plaza, a short walk to the restaurant
4
Had a great time at Alma By Juan Amador celebrating my birthday. Their 3 course set lunch was very value for money and food was delicious.
5
Alma is a comfy restaurant with warm welcome from their service crew. An excellent place for a romantic dinner date or a to impress your business associates. Food was one of a kind! I had 8 course meal while another had 6 course meal. The presentation of all the courses were remarkable and very creative! The taste of the food is scrumptious and you'll wish it will not end. The fushion between western and asian made the whole taste experience a sensation! Definitely will be back for more! Thanks Chef for all your well-thought food!! I enjoyed my dining experience very much
5
Amazing service from wait staff. Best Service I have had for many years! I had 3 course lunch. Very reasonably priced, lunch is a great way to experience fine dining. I had Hokkaido scallop (a generous entree), followed by sea bass. Standout was mushroom rag
5
Had dinner with my wife. We had the 6 course degustation menu for $138++ per pax, plus 1 wine pairing.The food was very unique and delicious. Started with the snacks which left you wanting for more. This was followed by a savoury egg. The Tasmanian Ocean Trout and Mata Lembu were to die for.The only let down was the Mangalica pork, which did not really match the rest of the dishes as it was a bit fatty and the did not have the great flavours as the other dishes.The ambience was peaceful for a Saturday night, and staff were extremely attentive and friendly. I will definately go back
5
I had went to Alma, and the service was perfect. I had a 3 course menu, with crispy tofu and foie gras sauce, steak with potatoes and 3 layered lemon dessert. I loved the plate design and also the taste of different flavours. Also, the service is excellent and the price is definitely fair
4
Went again with my 2 teenage kids and another teenager on last Friday after I had my Birthday treat in may. Usual lunch crowd but service was still good. Appetizer(toufu) is the best among the 3 courses. Will go back again when the menu is changed.
5
Food was absolutely divine with excellent wine pairing. Service crew was extremely attentive and food presentation made it even more delicious. Definitely worth going if you'd like to impress.
5
Went there for the second time. The menu has been changed, but the food quality is still very impressive. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for fine dining in Singapore with reasonable price.
5
Great value set lunch. Attentive staff with good manners. Nice atmosphere and delicate food presentation
5
I had the 8 course. Portions are great, flavors are even better. The wait staff were in top of their game. Wonderful time all in all.
4
the set lunch priced at 39++ was fantastic value for a michelin starred place like alma (though with additions for premium selections). my favourite was the tofu in foie sauce. so so goo
1
We were excited about eating here but unfortunately the service was a let-down.It's a lovely dining room, quiet and spacious.After explaining my food intolerances to the waitress, we went through the lunch set menu options to see what could be altered to be gluten and dairy free. After giving my order I confirmed that she would speak to the kitchen and make substitutions. When I went to wash my hands, my husband checked again with waiter Joseph. I ate my entree but my main came out and they'd only made it dairy-free, not gluten-free but apologised and took it back to the kitchen. That's ok, mix ups can happen. It's how they handled it next that let them down.The waitress came to top up my water glass and blamed me for not telling her about the gluten intolerance. Then came a very long wait. One hour and 15 minutes after we arrived we were still waiting on our main meals and I was concerned that the entree I'd eaten was going to make me sick due to gluten so we had to leave.I'm sorry I can't recommend it to anyone with food allergies or intolerances
4
Decided to try following it being awarded a Michelin star. Was warmly welcomed with sparkling wine. Well executed menu with accompanying wines - would go again
5
I love lobster and did not pass up the chance for lobster for starter and main with good red wine for a preview lunch in a 2 star Michelin restaurant. The starter was excellent with a hint of lemon and mentaiko garnished with vegetable, green Apple and flowers. The lobster with angel hair pasta was very good. Both had generous servings of tender lobster.The lemon mousse with plum gel. A good ending for lunch.The wine was 2013 Great Flyte Cabernet Sauvignon. Easy drinking and just right for lunchHappy 52nd National Day
5
Always wanted to visit Alma for a long time but never got around it. Finally got the opportunity when I got a lunch invitation.SGD$39.00++ set lunch was extremely worth it, though one have to expect plenty to supplement options (top-ups) for more desirable dishes. Overall experience was great, especially the consistent high-level of service by Shuji? and the unpretentious meal. It was innovative, conservatively-creative yet direct. Looking forward to be back for dinner this Friday
5
Dinner for husband's birthday celebration on 7 August 2017 - Monday. Kudos to Chef's vast experience, the 8 courses dinner suits our palate perfectly, we ordered 2 glasses of white wine to start with, a bottle of red & washed down with 2 glasses of Louise XIII. Fantastic food with perfect services, perhaps the best restaurant for fusion fine dining yet not-intimadating experience in S'pore. We'll come back again to pamper ourselves for a simply elevated night pretty soon before any special occasion.
4
A good place for a good meal.
Service is good.
Ambience is good.
Recommended if you are in town, but book in advance.
5
amazing dinner. Try the degustation dinner menu with oyster , foie gras , Hokkaido scallop , Boston lobster .... The best thing ever is the Miyazaki beef. The softest beef I ever tasted. Love the service.
5
I had the crispy tofu, lobster angel hair pasta and the lemon dessert. Every single dish was outstanding. I made a special request for my pasta which was taken care of.When the waiter saw that I was on my laptop, he offered me WiFi access. Several members of the team stopped by to greet me while waiting for the perfect moment and not being intrusive. There was attention to detail and impeccable service despite a busy time at the restaurant.I dine at restaurants a lot, and I can surely say that Alma deserves its rave reviews

On personal business from Boston. I was looking for a nice meal with my son on a Saturday and came across Alma. Candidly I didn't spent a lot of time looking at reviews, but heard from a local friend that this is a little gem that we should try. The picture on their website might give you the impression that there maybe more "form" (the dishes looks beautiful) then "taste". I am sure a number of foodies out there knows what I mean by that. We have all been fool before. In the case of Alma, it delivers on all the senses. The taste, texture the progression (the amuse bouche) was probably one of the best I have ever tasted anywhere. What a way to start a 8 course tasting! The Foie Gras Parfait, encapsulated in dark chocolate and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, provided a delightful creamy texture when you take a bite with the accompanying five spice cherries and hibiscus providing the acidic balance. Followed by Hokkaido Scallop, Norwegian Hake, Poached Boston Lobster in Thai Yellow Curry (yes, the irony) and my final savory course of Miyazaki Beef (probably A4 grade, maybe 3 oz) was paired with artichokes and yuzu kosho. All the course delivered! Compared to couple of other 2 Michelin star restaurants we visited in the past month (The Modern in NYC and Les Amis in Singapore), I would say Alma was superior in every way. The service was prompt, non intrusive and warm. In particular, Saravana, one of the manager was knowledgeable and welcoming. And the final piece de resistance was the price. The 8 course tasting was only $130 US dollars!!! I paid more than twice that much at The Modern and Les Amis. We will be back soon

Situated in a quiet corner of Scotts road, I was mesmerized by the colonial building. Alma, lies in the Goodwood park hotel is a hidden gem. Friendly and attentive services made me feel a hint of personal touch in their unique way. Food is as though like a polished gem, shine upon and it sparkles with light. Those combination were beautiful and unique.
5
I went to try the lunch set menu. The food was nice and tasty, thank you to Chef and the team. The service is fantastic, the staff are able to explain every dish and answer all the enquiry...well done! I will be back again to try the dinner. Strongly recommend this restaurant
5
My wife and I booked a table to celebrate our anniversary at Alma tonight. Service is immaculate, staffs are incredibly friendly and attentive. And we would like to give a big thumbs up to Joseph,the assistant manager, who is very caring and nice (He told us jokes and performed a magic trick to entertain us!)Nevertheless, food was really nice and very reasonably priced. Wine pairing is perfect.Since it's our anniversary, desserts were written ''happy anniversary'' and the staff even gave us a pair of complimentary champagne as a celebration.Overall, the experience is amazing, highly recommended
5
We tried the 6-course dinner menu at Alma and were quite impressed with the food, particularly the Flavours. The snacks brought at the beginning were some of the best little nuggets of flavour I have had. A four glass wine pairing was available at 58++ which we skipped in favour of just two recommendations from the ma√É¬Ætre d' - both were great choices. The service was very personal and attentive. Loved the experienc
5
Alma reiterates why Michelin Starred restaurants are a notch above. The attention to detail is extraordinary, as is the service. Warm and yet non-intrusive, I dined here alone and yet never felt for a moment that I did not have company. The food is spectacular, each dish cooked and plated to perfection. Go for the set lunch, you'll be dreaming of the 3 course meal for days
5
Great restaurant in many ways which made the evening exceptional. - very friendly staff - nice decor- great menus which display the whole genius and creativity of the chef. No items are redundant between the 6 and 8 course menu which can be shared - lots of great amuse bouche and miniardises- reasonably priced wine list A must try in Singapore. One of the few very best gastronomic restaurant in town. Best price quality definitely.
5
If you're in Singapore I definitely recommend this restaurant the food was very good unique the chef is lovely and Suji helped us a lot she was super
5
Amazing food. Amazing service! Especially Sugi was fantastic! A must in Singapore! From the amuse bouche to the petit four! Absolutely delicious!
4
This is a unique and exquisite restaurant catering wonderfully crafted local (Asian Chinese) and western fusion food. Fresh lobsters are very well prepared and individual dishes portioning are just right. Wine list are pretty selective and pricing are reasonable. Service staff are well equipped and efficient.

It was mom's birthday and we wanted to have a special meal.... we chose Alma as friends had raved about the good food quality. The experience at Alma was even better than we had hoped. We were prepared for an atas evening of fine dining, but instead found the staff here light and welcoming. The chats throughout the night entertained my parents so much, coupled with the good food... we felt so pampered and special.Thank you Joseph and team and to chef who took the time to come out to chat with dad. A memorable evening indeed.
5
How do I express this with mere words ?!? The taste of all the exquisite courses was just stupendous ! The dishes were so delicious they were outta this world !! And all so prettily plated & presented . Our compliments really go to the chefs who whipped up this fantastic meal . Service by J. Boon & his team was extremely attentive without being intrusive . All - in - all , a faultless gastronomic experience, definitely worthy of a return visit

From the moment we stepped in to the moment we stepped out of Alma, every aspect of the dining experience is positive. With so many high end restaurants appearing in the city, one doesn't fall short of experiencing some over-priced dining experience. In the case of Alma, while the dinner is not on the low end at all, the complexity of the food which your taste buds would agree to suddenly make one feel that every cent paid is worth it. We went for the 8-course meal and from amuse bouche to petit four, the presentation and each dish has delighted my partner and I. The food is complex without being pretentious. The flavour of each ingredient just appear one by one in your mouth, and not just all meshed up together into one singular flavour. Do not be fooled by the petite portion of each dish. By the time we hit the 2nd last dish - beef, we were really quite full. Wine list is very comprehensive with huge range of prices. It's not hard to find something below $100. Upon arrival, we were offered a glass of champagne on the house and a round of Calvados at the end of meal. Now, this may be a form of celebration of their recent achievement of Michelin star so I wouldn't urge you to expect this by default. However, it does give you an idea of their warm hospitality. Service was excellent. All the staff was very attentive and smiley! Definitely a place to go to for a special occasion. I'm still thinking of the food now
5
The set lunch is very good. I had the Hokkaido scallops and the lobsters and the angel hair lobster pasta. Dessert was fixed. The presentation, food and ambience was all TOP notch. Additional $8 for the scallops. The lobster pasta came with the standard set at no extra charge. All in my party of 3 had a bill of just under $200 as we had two starters which were above the standard set, 2 glasses of wine and 1 coffee. Would come back again for dinner
5
It was definitely an experience that will be engraved in our hearts for a life time. From the warm welcome of recognising my name to the impeccable personal service from every staff, even the Chef came out from the kitchen to greet us. They even remember my concern for a review written by another person and trust me, that bad review was not written for Alma, as the food served was extraordinarily exquisite. From the custard egg with warm homemade bread, the delectable Mata Lembu to my fresh juicy Hokkaido Scallops, every dish just made us felt out of this world. After dining before at Restaurant Andre, Odette, Gaggan and so on, i would say Alma deserve more than 1 Michelin Star! Just don't increase the price please if you do get 2 Michelin Stars.Thank you again team at Alma for making our night a truly memorable night
5
Pretty much perfect in every way. From the free champagne on arrival for all guests to celebrate their Michelin star to the service to the amazing and very delicious 8 course menu. Sublime all round. Relaxed atmosphere and for Singapore not expensive. Romantic too and I can't think of any faults.Highly recommend, we will be back
5
Fantastic food, incredible service and and all round good atmosphere. Went for a dinner with 6 friends, and none left disappointed. One had a dietary restriction and they solved that perfectly. Elda, Joseph, Sujee, Sara and Grace could not have been nicer. I can with my hand on my heart recommend this place to anyone.

Visited Alma, which held on to its one michelin star at the recent awards, last evening. The food at this restaurant is described as 'European, with asian influences'. We chose the 8-course menu complete with wine pairing, and one look at the menu provided some hint on the 'Asian' aspect of the dinner - three of the courses had ingredients sourced from Japan, and two or three courses had Thai leanings (think tom yum flavor, lemongrass etc).The service was generally very warm, and while it was upscale dining, it was not 'stiff'. The noise level was generally high, which reflected the low ceiling the restaurant is endowed with. Most of the dishes came beautifully presented; the pre-course amuse bouche provided us with some respite from the cardio-induced hunger. Going through the courses, the food was mainly good; the third dish, the 'Pata Negra', could do with (much) less salt, and i thought the fourth dish - the Hokkaido Scallop - had too much acidity. By the time we got to the much-awaited Miyazaki Beef (which was cooked beautifully to medium rare, but perhaps obscured by a rather strong yuzu kosho sauce), we were already very stuffed (from both the food and the wine pairing!)
5
Last night dinner was amazing, we ordered a 6 course meal and every dish was a work of art. Carefully crafted with complimentary flavour and visually captivating too. All thanks to the chefs and team effort. We managed to meet the chef too before we left! The server Joseph, remembered me from 9 months ago when I had my hen's night with the girls! And I recalled he had some magic tricks up his sleeve, so after having said that, he did it again. :) Everyone who works there are friendly and smiley, that set off a very nice atmosphere.It was a wonderful evening. If you want to find a way to enjoy a good night out, it's definitely here. :
5
Alma offers a great multi set menu I was very pleased with. Their European dishes are really worth a visit..
5
We went for a date night to Alma after hearing about it from a friend.We knew that Alma's team had one Michelin star and we were prepared for an exciting evening but the food and the people exceeded all our expectations!You may have missed the story of chef Muhammad Haikal Johari who is wheelchair-bound after an accident but it is a story that you want to know - story of hard work, hope, extraordinary courage, patience, love, support, friendship, companionship and never ending desire to overcome what many of us would consider impossible hurdles in life. The food that chef Haikal and his colleague chef Muhammad Sufian Zaini prepare will surprise your palate, it will stimulate each of your senses with its magical dance of colors, flavors and textures and you will be charmed by the impeccable, warm, generous service of the two assistant managers Mr. Joseph and Mr. Saravana and their team.The atmosphere is beautiful and peaceful. There are several options for private dining. The wine list is very good and extensive. And again, the food and the service is what will make you come back to this delicious place. We have been traveling a lot and eating at different good places but thanks to the unique talents of the chef and the warm welcome of the team, we will remember this extraordinary experience for years to come.Thank you
5
Tried the highly recommended crispy tofu as starter, simply delicious. Main course was pan seared seabass. Excellent pairing with the brocoli as side. And ending off with delightful lemon creamy dessert which was very light, great balance between sweet and sour, with a tint of fresh mint. Fantastic meal
5
Was there for a celebration. We were very impressed with our food & the presentation. Will go back again.
5
Wonderful place to dine it, cosy & value for money. Highly recommended It's a nice place to have anniversary & corporate dinner.
5
This is a fantastic place! The food is simply excellent. Over the last two months I have been in great restaurants in London, Paris, New York, and Montreal. Alma has the style, delicious food, and amazing staff. I came here for the first time in April. In June, the waiter still remembered that I had Calvados as digestif. The Jerusalem artichoke is unbelievable. And for this quality, prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended
1
Nothing. From the very sweet eggy amuse bouche to the nasty wasabi coconut jelly dessert, Alma had staff that complained about their working hours and the worst food ever. 7 out of 8 courses were hot & cold bites of seafood.. Mixing sweet carrot granite with Uni and prawns tasted all wrong! Chocolate and oysters?? How could someone come up with such a pairing, and destroy what would have been a delicious dish. Lobster wasn't fresh and the duck was room temperature. Save your money and go anywhere but here
5
I went to Alma for dinner and was delighted with the 6 course dinner. The dishes were exquisite, tantalizing for my tastebuds - absolutely delicious. It deserves the Michelin star in every sense. The service was also fantastic, and I would want to be back again in the next month or so. Thumbs up!Krys_Singapor
5
Came here with my parents and ordered their set lunch. Service and quality of food were good. Especially liked their gazpacho and cod icefish. The skin of the cod icefish was so crispy and fish meat was so moist.
5
Thoroughly Enjoyed the evening. Enjoyed the meal and the little surprises that comes with it .. and the blend with Asian flavours derived from Kaffir Lime, Lemon Grass, etc. I had the 6 course with wine pairing and its really well planned ...
5
Conveniently located in the heart of Singapore City centre & shopping belt. The restaurant is inside Goodwood Park Hotel, just minutes walk from the MRT.
Service staffs are good and good quality is excellent. They offer good recommendation & selection of wine.
5
Came here for a friend's birthday and we had a private section for our group. We had something like a 6 course meal with wine pairing. Before each course, April brilliantly explained what we were about to eat. The food was absolutely delicious. It's whimsical and something difficult to describe, you'll just have to experience it for yourself. Joseph was a delight as well and explained the wines beautifully. The service was just superior. This is a must try place if you're looking for a fine dining experience
5
Alma is a one star Michelin located in Goodwood Park Hotel in Scotts road, very near to Orchard. We went there for a romantic dinner and it was just perfect. The service is excellent. The atmosphere was very calm. We had the 6 courses set dinner with wine pairing. But first we had absolutely delicious and exquisite amuse bouches. and after our 6 courses, they brought us some petits fours and coffee. The dessert was gorgeous, We really did recommend this place, the fusion of the food and spices are just fantastic
5
Been wanting to check this place out for ages. When the stars aligned to present a serendipitous opportunity, I could not resist walking into Alma at 6 pm on a Saturday evening. Greeted by the affable restaurant manager, Giuliano, I was promptly seated and in no time decided on the 8 course Spring dinner menu with wine pairing (I had already scoped out the menus a few times online before this fortuitous evening).Service by April, Karan, and Saravanan was excellent throughout the evening. The first amuse bouche (there were two for my 8 course dinner) set the tone for dinner with an explosion of flavors and my palate was titillated and intrigued. And the epicurean hits just kept coming. The Foie Gras parfait was a delicious revelation in combining beets and horseradish which I would never have thought of combining. I had earlier shared with Giuliano that I wasn't keen on the Pata Negra and wondered if it could be substituted with a "Mata Lembu" from the 6 course menu instead and he very kindly acceded to my request - it proved to be the best thing ever! I've had tartare de boeuf, but this one had added dimensions of taste, aroma, and texture unlike most tartares I've had before. Not to mention, the "mata lembu" (Malay colloquialism for sunny side-up egg, literally "bullseye") was perfectly scrumptious. Just like the beet and horseradish combination was the secret key to unlocking the flavors of the foie gras parfait, I discovered another secret ingredient that was instrumental in the Hokkaido Scallop crudo - a lemongrass (Thai takrai) jelly that struck the right note amidst the prevalent sweetness of the daikon. The Norwegian Hake course was such a refined, elevated dish and continues the spring theme represented by the green color of petits pois. The Japanese strawberry dessert highlighted the seasonal flavors with amazing lychee granita and understated lemongrass ice cream. And wait, hold on, you still get coffee and petits fours which rivaled the amuse bouche in presentation! This was a very memorable dinner, to say the least, truly fine dining at its very best and not to be missed when in Singapore. Very highly recommende
5
The restaurant was quiet with pleasant background music. The staff were discreetly attentive. The food was excellent, presented in a playful yet artistic manner. The contrast in flavours and textures was quite delightful. The choice of wines was interesting and complimented the food excellently. If you are looking for an enjoyable foodie experience (and the price is not an issue) then this is the place to visit
5
This restaurant is really something, it is situated at the back of Goodwood Park Hotel. Very close to Orchard Road. The terrasse is furnished with great taste. The interior likewise in very good style. The food is international, just divine, really a fantastic experience to dine here.
5
I went there with 3 friends to celebrate one friend's birthday. Upon the staff's query during reservation, I shared that we would be there for a friend's birthday dinner. We got complimentary prosecco and a nice decorated version for the set meal dessert, even though I had not mentioned about the celebration upon arrival. The food itself was very delicately executed, with the choice of materials and flavours complementing very well. I had the 8-course Spring menu, and personal favourites are the Boston lobster and the Miyazaki beef. There was keen attention to guests, and the service staff made the dining experience a pleasurable one
5
Was there two evenings ago for a belated birthday celebration with my wife. Food was beautifully presented and each bite was both delightful and surprising. Service was prompt, attentive and all staff had a warm smile on their faces.Reasonably priced, highly recommended
3
At 39++ their set lunch is a good way to try out the place. Service was efficient, but the food quality was average. Perhaps their signature dishes weren't available in the set lunch which had limited choices.
5
Food was really special. We had the 6 course menu which was really sufficient, even for being hungry, but you wish to have 2 more courses because it is so delicious.
5
Alma's Michelin star is well deserved. We enjoyed a marvelous six-course dinner paired with excellent wines. From the first taste of the Spring Time finer snacks to the Amuse Bouche to each major course, the tastes and textures were an explosion of freshness and flavor. Chef Haikal Johari shows his mastery in every dish. The staff's hospitality was welcoming and attentive. Put Alma on your list for "must-visit" when you come to Singapore
5
It's worth every calorie & $$$!!! Thanks to Elda & Bas, our friendly servers....if anything, they are sweeter than our desserts & petit fours. So when are we coming again ah? When menu changes! Mmmmm....:) Very happy
5
I had their lunch set (39++) and chose their signature crispy tofu with foie gras emulsion, chilean seabass and pina colada dessert. The crispy tofu was such an original dish and the foie gras emulsion was out of this world. MUST TRY! Chilean seabass was well cooked and soft. It came with a saffron sauce and beurre au blanc, again, a nice pairing as the sauce was quite heavy and the fish was really light and moist. Pina colada is my favourite cocktail.. so needless to say i loved the dessert! Service was impeccable right from the beginning when they greeted us, down to the explanation of each and every dish (which i really appreciated) Overall great value for money at an established restaurant and looking forward to trying their dinner menu and newly opened bar area :

We stopped by for lunch when we were near the vicinity recently. The price is certainly Alma's great attraction especially with its Michelin accolade.I started with Salad of Pata Negra. Not the best and most popular choice I guess but I was thinking salad. Well, it was not too inspiring. The presentation was good but the Jamon Iberico was a disappointment, surprisingly. The beetroot was also bad.My main of fish was tender and nicely done. However, I was not too enamoured by the sauce which was too Thai and interrupted the taste of the whole meal.The dessert Pina Colada was a tease and though simple, I do enjoy it.Service was pleasant and they try to be good. However, it was short of fine dining professionalism if that's what you are looking for.This is an okay meal but not what I've come to expect of a Michelin meal. You don't get a dish that stands out in taste and last in the memory, there's no pleasant surprise or the sense of exquisiteness with the cooking, so in all it was just a well priced meal but falling a little short of my expectation
5
Well received upon arrival at Alma. Felt right at home. Good recommendation on wines for the night. Totally enjoyed the Degustation Menu. Pleasantly surprised with each course. Our compliments to Chef Haikal & his talented team. Kudos to Joseph Boon (magician of the night), Saravana & April for their outstanding service that made our night so enjoyable. Deserving of it's Michelin Star
5
Not to say the food isn't wonderful...it is. But the staff are spectacular. And the chefs modest but so impressive
5
Attended a dinner for 7 in their private dining room. The room was cozy and perfect for containing our group who got more boisterous with increasing alcohol intake.We had the 6 and 8 course menus amongst us. These proved to be refreshingly unique in artistic presentation as well as the use and combination of ingredients.Service was impeccable by our personal servers, Joseph (who regales us with his stories from his days on the cruise ship) and Sujee (who had to wait patiently for us to pipe down before introducing the next course).The birthday plate for each of us 3 celebrants was delicious!Fyi, a new menu starts next Wednesday
5
Went for lunch on a Wed afternoon. Know beforehand its a fine-dining restaurant, so I was astounded when I saw the set lunch only at $39 (ok, this is weekday rate). But along Orchard Road, you can easily bust the $50 mark for any casual dining restaurant, let alone a fine-dining type. Despite its very reasonable pricing, the quality of food and service were not compromised. Thanks to Giuliano & Joseph, not only I have enjoyed the experience of dining there, but also know a little more on the background of Juan Amador; he is actually one of the top chef in the world with a 3 stars Michelin rating! The ranges of wines and liquor are also impeccable. Highly recommended
5
We took a lunch in a private room.
Each dish was delicious and it was a pleasure for the eyes and the taste. The service was remarkable with Joseph and April.
A place to go!
5
Tofu mushroom - Great texture with fresh leafs as accent to taste. Asian flavoured / Coloured.
Peanut Colada - Well curated visually that fits perfectly sweet to the taste. Fresh appeal.
5
Service here is absolutely phenomenal. Be it a date, business meeting or a casual meal, Alma is the place to be. Fine selection of wine complements the meals. Selection of music adds a romantic flair to the atmosphere.
5
At the Goodwoood Park hotel, hiden in a side way, Alma is a gem. The presentation of food is original, The service is fine . The dishes offer a good choice of Spanish and European fares. Great wine list.The decor is interesting. Will go back
5
As a single traveller in Singapore I decided to have dinner at Alma. Being early at the restaurant, I had a warm welcome and Saravana en Giuliano made me feel at ease at once and kept me company throughout dinner. I had the 8 course menu and every course was delightful, perfect and so beautiful, a real pleasure for the eyes! I want to thank Saravana and Giuliano for spoiling me that evening! :-) But most important, I recommend Alma to everyone visiting Singapore. Thanks again for a delightful and unforgettable evening, Nielm
5
We were there for a 3 course set lunch. The choices were good. All the dishes were very tasty, well presented n came in good portions. The tofu with foie gras sauce and the salad with iberico pork were great starters. The pan seared fish n the lobster angel hair pasta were both very good too. Service was friendly n attentive n staff were knowledgeable.Our party of 7 enjoyed the meal very much n will be back for more.Only gripe we had were the overpriced coffees n tea that we had after lunch
5
Went to lunch today at Alma. Very much enjoyed the food , wine , atmosphere & service . We had a private room which seated 12 & would be perfect for a special occasion We were made to feel very welcome & Ill definitely be bac

Went with friends and each course was very tasty. Wine is reasonably priced and service good. We will retur

I actually came here many times but this is my first review. Its valentines' menu starting with 4 snacks which are nice. Then the bread with truffle butter. There's no taste of truffle oil.. just the real truffle which I like and the bread was still very warm when served to my table.This menu is for couples. Each course is the same ingredeint but cook differently which is very interesting.First course, the oyster. I exchanged with my boyfriend so I got the cold oyster served with grapefruit jasmine tea and cucumber sorbet. At first I thought I couldnt finish it, but finally i ate all. Its refreshing. The flavor is powerful. Foie gras is nice. The artichoke soup with cheese soufle is outstanding!Soufle is veryyyy light and the taste of soup is very nice.I cannot forget this dish. Its superbbb!The lobster is the main course. I wish i can get beef dish of my boyfriend too. At this stage, i was very full already.The dessert, i have got something with fennel ice cream, passion fruit flavor and the szechuan peppercorn meringue. Very nice.Last one is petit four. They are all nice. I'm very very full.I ll never forget this excellent Valentine's meal.The service is good. Price of the course is $350 per couple which I consider very cheap for the wonderful meal.Thank you Alma
5
The six course with wine pairing has the Iberico pork that was the highlight of the evening - especially when paired with "The Great Flyte" Cabernet Sauvignon
5
In the corner of Goodwood Park Hotel, parking is convenience and location is prime. The ladies have the 6-course with wine pairing (4 glass), whereas the gentlemen had the 8 course with wine pairing (5 glass). The service and ambience are tip top living up to the One-Star status. The presentation of the Spanish European fusion cuisine is surprisingly artistic, and the wine selection is impressive. The only set back is the dinner took us almost 4 hours, longer than we expected. However the price is reasonable for the quality fare we received. Average S$260 per head. I would recommend that you have a light breakfast and lunch before the feast
5
Went to Alma by Juan Amador last night with 2 friends. We had the 6 course meal. Dinner was superb. Every dish was excellent and the service was impeccable. I've dined at other top restaurants in Singapore (eg. Les Amis, The Corner House, Iggys etc) and this one ranks at par with those, except that Alma is much better value for money
5
Excellent food and presentation deserving of the Michelin star. Chef is very happy to accommodate dietary needs or special requests. Joseph Boon and team are simply amazing - probably the most attentive service in Singapore. Chef met us on our way out, which was very nice. Compliments to the entire team. Go there
5
Had a wonderful evening at Alma to celebrate my Husband's Birthday. The food was amazing and they were extremely accommodating when I telephoned prior to the evening to ask if a couple of the meat dishes could be exchanged for fish in the six course menu (which ended up being about 10 courses after all the extras). The ambience is good and the staff so kind without being intrusive. A colleague was also there at the same time and both of us have been raving about the restaurant this morning. We both thought it was excellent value
5
Alma offers delicious European fusion food. We enjoyed the three course set lunch at a very affordable price. The set lunch menu gives you plenty of tasty options. And, the chef was able to work with food restrictions, like dairy free and gluten free. Joseph and Sarah provided excellent service. They have a wonderful selection of wines, and also offer brandy and whisky. We're considering having our next group dinner here, as they have a semi-private dining room, as well as a private dining room with a wine cellar atmosphere. This place is perfect if you want to have lunch with friends, dinner with your spouse, have a private party, or host a business lunch or dinner. They also offer a Valentine's Day dinner on February 13 and 14, 2017. We look forward to coming back soon
5
I visited this place today with a ladies group that I belong to here in Singapore. It was AMAZING!!! Joseph who is the concierge/manager was great. He and the other staff were very attentive. Especially with a large group our food all came out at the same time. The food was wonderful as well. If you wanted to schedule something special for an intimate evening or a little function, they would definitely sit down with you and help you tailor that special event to make it perfect. I definitely plan on going back and having many events there
5
Reserved a table for 12 ladies for the set lunch. Service: I've dined at a lot of fine dining establishments in Singapore and this one is by far the best. Little things (hooks for your purse, glass never empty, chairs pulled out, napkins placed in laps, took pictures of our group, etc) go a long way in my book. Trust me they WILL take care of you and make you feel special. Food: The presentation of each course was beautiful done. The pork belly melted in my mouth! Crispy skin and full of flavour!!! The kale stalk I found a bit overwhelming for the dish and didn't think it added much to the pork...it was delicious on its own. The chef came to see us before the dessert course and was greeted with applause. Afterwards, Joseph brought out a delicious red wine that was on special for the New Year and gave us all a sample. Offered us a special price and 6 of us walked out with a bottle! Again, the service was impeccable. You must try this hidden treat. April, Sugee, Joseph, and Sara will not let you down. Cheers
5
I'm so glad I heard about this place from a friend. The food was delicious and beautifully presented, like works of art on our plates. I thought the $39 three course lunch was an excellent value, but we learned that they are more than willing to work with you and can customize your lunch by adding courses as you wish. (Note that lunch is served on Wednesday through Friday, but dinner is served every day except Sunday.) Also we had at least one member of our party who eats no gluten or dairy and the chef accommodated her request without hesitation. But the element that really made it exceptional was the attentive staff which is quite rare in my experience in Singapore. The staff just took care of our every need including replacing the napkin in my lap when I returned to my seat and even putting the sugar cubes and cream into my coffee for me! Special thanks to all who took care of our table today: Joseph, April, Sugee, and Sara. They also separated the bill among our group which was very much appreciated. Looking forward to another visit soon
5
A group of 12 ladies from the AWA of Singapore had a fabulous lunch at Alma today. The food was delicious and the staff extremely attentive!! We loved this restaurant and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for lunch or dinner!! Definitely at five out of five and within walking distance of Orchard MR
5
This is my second visit to Alma, with a new menu. Alma does not have ala carte only set menus, though the chef will provide something else outside of the menu if you don't fancy something. Service is impeccable. I won't describe all the courses, as the review would be too long. Suffice to say that each course was a surprise, European but with Asian influences, nothing "usual". All interesting combinations of ingredients. Key point is that it was balanced in flavors and beautiful to look at. The attached pictures tell all. Definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended.
5
A class of its own. The Boston Lobster and the Challans Duck were simply heavenly!
Sweet zone was tackled nicely too by the White Chocolate! Slurp...
5
Course after course is a feast for the eyes and gastronomically incredible. We savored every morsel of the 8-course meal. And the service was impeccable.
5
Exceptional food variety and quality. Totally uncommon creations that can be a real treat to your palate.
5
Should come and enjoy the cool ambience .
Booking is necessary for nice sitting. Chefs and team members are friendly.
A wide variety of wine collections etc.
5
Other than the great food at an affordable price, I must say Alma service is beyond my expectation. If I have to bluntly compare, the service is much better than (Odette). Joseph, one of the most bubbly employee in Alma ensure my clients and myself are well taken care of. From touring us around the private cellar, to sharing with us the drink tasting, this afternoon lunch is really a treat! With a service that is from the heart, I am really impress

It is great pleasure to be at Alma with our best friends. The chef selected meal is wonderful, and the last touch of the dessert selected by the chef is magical. We have a few after dinner drinks and enjoy the great host of the manager. It makes our night perfect

This restaurant is really special. The food deserves the Michelin star. The staff was super friendly. If you want to spend an evening with great food and an astonishing hospitality, visit this place. Prices were quite OK for a Michelin starred restaurant.I would definitely come back
5
Walking in the restaurant, the servers greeted each of us. Felt so welcomed. The ambience of the place is very cozy and comfortable as well. Food presentation was such a mind blowing experience, very creative. Taste of the food is very unique, one of a kind I've tasted thus far. Tasteful and delicious!! I had the 8 course meal and surely will come back for more!

Went to Alma for their lunch. It was delicious and I was very very surprised to find out how affordable their prices are for a Michelin-starred restaurant! Love the ambience and the service staff there were very attentive! Completely enjoyed my experience there! Of course, the meal was exquisite. Keep up the great work! If you're still thinking about whether you should try it out, think no further! Just go for it and assure you won't regret it

I went to Alma's for new year's eve dinner out of curiosity.. having experienced numerous setbacks while trying to get a table previously.After the meal, the reason for my numerous setbacks was apparent. Usually, most restaurants even Michelin starred, have one or two dish out of the set that were mediocre. But Alma was firing on all cylinders for all the dishes from pre-appetiser till the petit fours, which is a rarity.Quality of service was excellent as well, as expected from a Michelin starred establishment. However a minor blemish would be the length of service. It would be better if shortened. I entered at 8pm and concluded a few minutes shy of midnight.But still, keep up the good work and i would highly recommend it for anyone who wish to go on an exceptional gastronomical journey

We had a great experience at Alma. The menu was original and they were flexible when we asked for some amendments. The service was great; something lacking in a lot of the better restaurants in Singapore. The Michelin star is well received.
5
stunning food and service, I'll def come back again!!
The truffle cold pasta with lobster was superb and wine pairing was perfect with each dish.
Had a dinner there tonight and already made a booking for lunch next week before leaving the restaurant.
5
Great experience, friendly staff alll full of conversation, top notch food at reasonable prices for Michelin Star standard. Shout out to Joseph, Elda, Suji for the great service on the night. In terms of food, quality and taste definitely of the one star standard or more. Loved the menu, and the efforts to make it interesting, Music and interior design should undergo some revamp to create an atmosphere more becoming of a Michelin one star experience. Looking forward to coming back here soon.

My friend and I wandered into this Michelin rated restaurant by chance, as we had originally intended to go to another restaurant in Goodwood Park hotel and happened to park in front of Alma by Juan Amador, and curiosity prompted us to pop into this new restaurant.We had no idea what kind of cuisines are served in Alma as most of the time we eat either Japanese or steak. European with Asian touch, this is what we were told. To our surprise, the cuisines just delighted our taste buds. It was a totally different experience from eating the regular cuisines we were used to. To top up our satisfaction, the attentive waitress, Suji, pampered us with good service attitude throughout the dinner.At $138 per person for a Michelin rated dinner, it's really value for money

Celebrated my birthday at Alma and we were treated warmly by their service staff. They were very attentive and friendly especially Joseph, Elda and Surgi. Food was great and there were some dishes that wowed us over with its presentation. Even though we had a 5 years old with us, the restaurant tried their best to make her feel welcome as well and so young diners are not frowned upon which is good news for us. Definitely a place I will recommend for a celebratory dinner
5
Divine. Mouthwatering dishes are the hero with their accompaniments doing their delicious part. (Talking about the creative appetizers and complimentary glass of Blanc-de-blanc.) The restaurant creates atmosphere with its darkened mood lighting and Spanish touch. However, the dishes are contemporary European cuisine with plenty of Asian influences. I highly recommend that you opt for the wine pairing with their six courses menu. Service is top notch and the amenities are spotless. A step above all other restaurants in the heart of Orchard road
5
Located in the beautiful and nostalgic Goodwood Park Hotel this European/fusion restaurant serves one gastronomic delight after another. The decorations is very tasteful and the chairs are very comfortable. We took my mother in law there, who just arrived from Europe. The chef is from Thailand and knows how to prepare and create new versions of European delights with some Asian/ Japanese touches. From the amuses bouches ('snacks') till the appetizers, mains and desserts, highlight after highlight, a feast for your tastebuds. A lot of conplimentary surprises as well, it does feel very welcoming!Staff very competent and friendly, appear really interested in their guests and their experience in their restaurant. Something that is not found everywhere in Singapore...not even in the high end restaurants.If there would be one point of improvement, it would be the speed. A little bit more time between the dishes would have been better.Best thing is that this is not just a dinner, but an evening of culinary experiences
5
Innovative use of ingredients and whimsical presentation combined with affordable pricing is a winner in my book. That Michelin star is well deserved. Highly recommend the wine pairing option for greatest satisfaction.
5
Went here for the third time, this occasion was X-mas eve. The chef went out of its way to prepare something that was not yet part of the menu (it was actually a "sneak peak"of the new winter menu", as we had already had the menu they were serving that night twice before. Un-Singaporean good service (i.e. it is hard to find good service at this level in Singapore and April and Joseph -the manager, this a great job). Food is excellent and innovative, with very interesting and refreshingly unexpected flavor combo's. It is obvious why this place received a michelin star and while not cheap, it is overall good value for mone
5
The atmosphere is great place for dining! I like the pics of Birds of America by John James Audubon all over the walls.Tried the Hamachi, Wagyu Beef and Pina Colada. Very nice, especially the Wayne Beef, the degree of doneness was just nice, tender and juicy. Highly recommended to come again
5
Enjoy the food very much during my last visits. They have changed the menu and I really like the food presentation. Taste was great too and very consistent coz I have visited several times with friends and family.
5
Awesome food & desserts with friendly & knowledgeable waiters to serve you in the cosy and stylish restaurant to dine at your comfort for all occasions. They have special excellent wine collections too. Highly recommended to dine for all occasions to celebrate.
5
I'm glad with the choice of venue to celebrate the birthday of a special friend tonight. The food does more than satisfy the palate. The creativity of plating the food pleases the eyes. The attentive service staff is a rare find in Singapore. The ambience allowed us to enjoy the meal. Great food and great service. Highly recommended for this well deserving Michelin starred restaurant.
5
MealCrispy Tofu -- the most memorable of the whole lunch! The hint of truffle was just nice.Cod -- texture was good, a little on the salty side but otherwise deliciousPanna Cotta -- the presentation of the dish was a surprise, it was beautifully done unlike the usual that you may find elsewhere. Taste-wise, it was an interesting flavour, but I couldn't taste the rum in it.Atmosphere -- it was pleasant, quiet and cosy.ServicePolite and welcoming. Waiters introduced each dish and were attentive to our needs
5
Awesome service and staff, Joseph made our visit extra special by ensuring that we were comfortable and our little girl, Jessica (aged 5) had something to est too. We all enjoyed our time and meal. Alma is a place you must visit
5
You would expect this newly-crowned 1-star restaurant to deliver in terms of ambience, food quality and service. But you would never expect such great value. 6-course dinner below USD 100 and 8-course at about USD 20 more. And in generous portion. You really can't ask for more. I will definitely revisit, very soon
5
Service was excellent especially attended by Juliano.Forgot what he said, but attention rendered to us was neat.Meal was excellent too, the sweet bud well served via the pre and post meal

Was invited to join Gianni Gagliardo wine dinner at Alma... oh my! was so glad that i came, what a great experience.... Arrived Alma around 7.15pm (dinner starts at 7.30pm), was welcomed with a glass of white wine - server kept offering to refill... something unusual in Singapore... but its a good sign :)The wine dinner is 5 coures menu with Gianni Gagliardo wine pairing at $138++ (!!!), in case you are not familiar with Singapore dining scene.. this is very very reasonable! After some tapas and potato breads to start off.. the first course was cauliflower paired with white wine... great kickstarter..2nd dish was pacific saury (paired with san ponzio 2009... easy red)... great taste... now come the highlight (3rd) - wagyu beef paired wtih la matta 2013 (the italian mgr explained that it mean 'mad lady' :p)... wow... very good pairing.. very tasty.. was wondering why wagyu was not the main course.. the answer came shortly.... the pork cheek was fantastic.. my friends were also surprised how can pork taste so good... and even better than waygu?.. and great show of culinary skills here, and its paired with 3 glasses of different docg - 2011, 2012, 2008 (all great wines, typical old world - earthly, chocolate, full of berries, great nose, long finish... very happy with the wines)... the wonder evening ends with yoghurt and more wine! - villa m... very sweet finish... a dinner to remember for a longggg time.. Altogether, the dinner featured 7 wines.. including the refills, i must have had almost 1 bottle of fine wine by myself.. what a great deal!.. checked with the server on how to join the mailing list.. unfortunately, there's isn't any... was told that i can follow them on facebook for any future wine dinner... looking forward to the next wine dinner at Alma already... hopefully price remains the same... :

We were spending a week in Singapore and I wanted to eat something different then the traditional local food, so I decided to have lunch at Alma restaurant. We were warmly welcome at our arrival and they helped my husband to get in the restaurant since there is no ramp for a scooter or wheelchair; once inside of the restaurant there is enough room to move around. The ambiance is nice, made me feel relaxed and comfortable. We had the 3-course menu and wine; everyone asked for a different dish and all of us were happy with our meal. Food was very tasty as expected. The staff is very friendly and made us feel welcome
4
An excellent experience and great value for money. A truly hidden gem. Great space for business entertainment
5
Love the food.. and even every course looks small portions; but so fulfilling nice dinner :)
Pleasantly satisfied with the warm ambience, great attentive service & nice fine food presented to us.
5
A meal befitting its Michelin star.
Lots of play with its presentation and flavor. The ingredients were top notch and good mix of Asian and western flavors.
Service was attentive and the flow was well-timed.
Worth a return visit.
5
Taste fabulous & amazing great! A wonderful experience for fine dining dishes üòäüòäüòç! Look forward for next visit.
5
Definitely a must to visit. Fine dining at reasonable pricing at the orchard road area. Good selection of wines too.
5
I love the food and the wine. Service is top notched, befitting of a michelin starred restaurant. We had the 8 course dinner. Very fulfilling and i would definitely recommend my friends and relatives to go.
5
Was there meeting up with a group of friends, we had wine pairing and 5 course meals. Not only was the food presented beautifully, the taste was excellent. I don't normally eat pork, however I savoured every bit of the pork cheek. And definitely a great place for wine lovers!
5
It was a wonderful lunch at Alma last week! I was there for a business lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised with the warm ambience, attentive staff and delectable food presented to us. I had the set lunch that was priced reasonably at sgd 39++. There were choices for Hamachi, Onion Soup and Crispy Toufu for appetizer. The latter was recommended and I had no regrets! The toufu was home-made, silky and fried with a thin layer of crisp that simply melted in my mouth! The sauce was a layered with dark garlic, fresh mushrooms and foie gras and that perfected a great way to kick start a great lunch ahead! For mains, I was trying to avoid red meats and opted for the BostonLobster angel hair pasta and I had no regrets! It was infused with Tom yam favor and was saut√É¬©ed to perfection !Desert was the star performer. The fresh coconut cream on the Pina colado was light and complemented the entire dish very well. I look forward to going Alma soon
5
Alma is definitely worthy of its Michelin star. Every meal has been consistently excellent with presentation, flavor, and service all done with the utmost detail. If you appreciate wine it will make the experience even better. Alma has a selection of wines that are as highly rated as it's food

One never knows what to expect when you dine in a restaurant for the first time. It can be a good experience (which most of us do wish for) and at times, it can be a really poor experience. However, once in a long while, you are surprised by a small handful of restaurants by their wonderful cuisine and makes you want to return back again to try something new.That was Alma by Juan Amador for me today. I had lunch with some business associates and my colleague. While the conversation was a combination of business and getting to know each other, our conversations drifted frequently to share about our personal memories of great restaurants and food that we have tasted. I got to know more about the restaurant, how it started and where their inspiration came from.I had a set lunch menu - starting with an onion soup for appetizer, followed by Boston Lobster Linguini infused with Tom Yam and finally a Pineapple Pina Colada for desert. All three were outstanding in their presentation, taste and texture. I particularly love the Boston Lobster Linguini as the Tom Yam flavours heightens the sweetness of the lobster. Simply love this dish. The Pineapple Pina Colada was a great close to the meal - it was full of flavor and it wasn't too sweet - very balanced.I would certainly go back again - but you do need to make a reservation especially if you are going there for dinner
4
Came here on a Saturday night and this place was not even half fullThey have a 6 or 8 course menu and we opted for the latter as the main was Miyazaki beefThe dishes were very good, and we were looking forward to the beef. However when it arrived, we were told it's wagyu from Australia . Hmm..The chef also spoke to a few tables but missed u
5
Delicious throughout the 6 course meal. Love the cozy environment and excellent services they served.
5
The personnel is very welcoming. The food is at the expected level for a Michelin star restaurant. Some courses are stunning and very tasty. We spent a very nice diner at Alma. The prices are very reasonable given the quality of the food/wine
5
We enjoyed a large group dinner at Alma and were thoroughly impressed with the ingredient selection, complexity of flavoring, and artistic presentation. The wine list was quite large and the wait staff was as courteous as one would expect in Singapore. Overall, quite impressive.
5
I dined at Alma this week and was blown away. The food was amazing in all aspects: Presentation, Taste, blend of flavors, sequence. The dishes although small were extremely filling. The service, something often not great in Singapore, was excellent. Since the menus are all set courses, one should prepare to come for a long meal but it is well worth the time spent and it was one of my favorite dining experiences in Singapore
5
Execellent food that comes with creative food deco. Service was excellent as they explained each of the dish they served from beginning till the end with a nice smile. Price for the dinner course meal is worth the value too. Would definitely recommend Alma to my friends
5
The dishes are innovative, Creative and simply delicious. The service was exceptional - great server. My favourite dishes are Australian pork belly. Skin is Super crispy but not hard. Their signature Pigeon dish. For their angel hair pasta with Boston lobster, I will prefer Garibaldi angel hair pasta.
4
Was there with a few friends and was very pleased with the food, service and ambience. Every dish was a surprise and it taste as good as it look. All the staff were very warm and friendly especially manager Joseph. Would definitely return for another lovely experience.

I used to go to the previous restaurant before Alma took over. A month after Alma took over the premise , I visited the resturant once for dinner and was kind of disappointed with the food & decor. Went back today for lunch after they were awarded one Michelin star. I had the set lunch, my pork was good and my friend's lobster paste was nice too. All good except the decor ... I wish they kept the old decor (especially those big and nice mirrors) ! Well the toilets and the wine cellar remain unchanged ...which I still like !
3
Agreed with previous reviews that food was pleasant and good value but not up to michelin expectations. There is nothing spanish about this place and really misleading as the food we had were more asian and Japanese influence. There were only 2 menus to choose from and does not cater choices for people with dietary constraints
5
Went to Alma to reconnect with our long time friend, Assistant Manager/Sommelier Saravana (formerly of Verre Bistro and Wine Bar). What a treat! Located on Scotts Road near Far East Plaza so easy access from the Orchard area. We were greeted with champagne and wonderful snacks and the choice between 6 or 8 course menu (we opted for the 8 courses and ordered our own wines rather than go with the wines they'd chosen). Everything was absolutely delicious (I think the very fancy grilled cheese might have been my favorite) and creatively prepared. The service was spot on, nice ambience (although the lighting was a bit bright) and we had plenty of time to enjoy our friends and each food course. I definitely recommend this restaurant and will return again
5
Went to Alma to celebrate wedding anniversary - had a splendid, almost perfect dinner. Food was outstanding. Service was good. Alma is a must visit in Singapore.
5
Excellent food and service ! We will definitely go back to Alma again !
I had a very enjoyable birthday dinner at Alma !
5
I made the reservation right after it was announced that they received a Mstar. I was impressed by every dish and it was amazing.
5
Had a memorable dinner: food was excellent, ambiance was pleasant and service was professional. Being a pure fine dining restaurant, Alma' s food is absolutely worth its Michelin star. Their cuisine is innovative, while their execution is flawless. One of the best restaurants in Singapore. Great value for money. Highly recommended!
5
We weren't expecting much, frankly. I'd bumped into Joseph, the manager, and he was such a nice guy, I promised to 'pop in sometime'.On the last day of my trip, my best mate in town (luckily and councidentally a 'foodie', popped in for dinner.We each chose a different tasting menu, and settled back.Then...fireworks!I can honestly say this was in the top five meals I've ever had. To qualify that, I've done Paris's 'impossible to get a booking' culinary tables. I've done the Fat Duck, and several Gordon Ramsays. I've done Ferran Adria's El Bulli.This meal outshone many of those, and while foregoing the theatricals, gave Adria a run for his money.The head waiter is a jewel, and looks a bit like Sammy Davis Jr. He's funnier, and more charming. Every member of staff was friendly, and totally proud of and knowledgable about the food.Enough. Just sell your granny into slavery and go to Alma. You'll thank me, I guarantee
4
Took a last minute detour to Alma and was very happy they had available seats on a Friday evening. The food was top notch and definitely worthy of its recent one star award. The service was very personable and first rate for a restaurant of this caliber. Overall a great dining experience and will definitely be back
5
Went last nite with a girl friend, the food was beautifully displayed and the service was excellent! Love their complimentary potato bread. They have an extensive wine list with every budget of wine available which is very good! Ambience was perhaps abit too quiet, no buzz and I could not hear any music on the background (which I would have preferred for this type of meal). In any case, they are deserving of their michelin star
2
Service was patchy at best. They even missed one wine in my wine pairing. Food was one dimensional. All sauce and little depth of flavour. Overall was very disappointed. On the plus side when I said this to the management they did offer us a complimentary calvados and cognac. Which was nice.
3
service - though not quite up to expectations for a fine dining restaurant, staff come across as ernest and sincere . Food - not too bad relative to the price point and each dish was interestingly presented, though none stands out in particular. Ambience - was unfortunately a total let down. not about it having to look expensive, but think it could still have been tastefully done. it's unfortunately a huge mismatch.
4
We came here for dinner, and chose to order √† la carte (instead of the 'omakase' surprise menu), in order to have a say on what we're eating. It turned out to be the right decision, because the starters are definitely more innovative and better executed than the mains. The bread (served on hot stones) and amuse-bouche are remarkable. The lamb tartare is excellent, the cold angel hair pasta very good (but less yummy than Gunther's version), the crispy egg quite creative. The mains are not terrible, but ALL of them are let-downs. Puddings are better, especially the interesting truffle dessert. Impressive wine list. Exemplary, pro-active service.Alma may have a Spanish owner and a Spanish soul ('alma'), but it is definitely not a Spanish restaurant - more a modern European one with Asian influences. It clearly shows the biases of the first Michelin Singapore guide, which is over-generous with chefs who have already earned Michelin stars elsewhere (eg. Jo√´l Robuchon, Juan Amador, Wolfgang Puck, Kanesaka-San). Alma is good, and represents good value for the quality it delivers, but if Gunther's or Iggy's don't get a star, nor should Alma. We went on a Saturday evening, and there were quite a few empty tables. Singapore foodies know
4
Enjoyable dinner with great friends and great food. Wine selection was good and paired very well with the food. Service was great by most standards, however due to the restaurant's references to Michelin Stars impeccable service was expected but unfortunately not delivered. Would certainly return.
5
Organized a birthday dinner a couple of days after Michelin awarded it 1 star (was apparently the only one I could get a table at short notice, so didn't have high hopes). Parents in law were a little naggy beforehand when they saw the price, but once the amuse bouche came all complaints melted away. Birthday girl (actually my mother in law) ordered the 5 course, but regretted a little she didn't order the 6 (or the 8 for that matter). On the downside, service was a little slow, but more than makes up for it through the quality of the food. Had to be the food that got them the 1 star
4
It was a business lunch at Alma by Juan Amador. We had the 3 course set lunch. Upon stepping into the restaurant, we smell a woody fragrance, it was a posh yet comfortable / casual setting. The 3 course set menu was well explained by the waitress. We chose the tofu as appetizer, I had the pork as main dish. The pork was almost like a super uber great chinese style roast pork. The sauces greatly blend with the main dish. I'm not a foodie but I find myself looking forward to the going back again. I hope to try their new menu next month. The only set back is the expensive parking at Goodwood Park Hotel. DO NOT park there. Having lunch set us back by $10 just for parking
4
Chosen this restaurant to celebrate my sister's birthday. We've had experience in a lot of pricey and so-called nice restaurants, but have ended in disappointment.Been there on a Saturday night, the menu consists 4, 5, or 6 course carte blanche meal. Both of us have chosen the 8-course one, with 6 glasses of wine pairing. the food was excellent and the speed of serving food and wine was just right. The wine matches the food perfectly. The service was so nice and the chef came out and had a chat with us. We stayed 3.5h (which was really long) but it didn't feel that way. Was a fantastic restaurant and definitely bring more friends there after work for their sangria evening
4
On a recent work trip through Singapore, a local friend and I decided to go Spanish and dine at Alma by Juan AmadorWhile the watery, forgettable martini was quickly put aside (no cocktail maker on that night), the food hit a much different note.The sliced tuna with shiitake mushrooms in slices and a broth with Thai green curry and basil oil.The lobster in an amazing lettuce sauce and a squid ink lattice with flowers was exquisite.The main tooth fish with a luscious saffron sauce and an amazing smooth rich olive pur√É¬©e.The wine was a rather austere yet elegant 2013 Atterns, Fruli Pinot Grigio.The oxtail slice, falling apart after slow cooking, wrapped in crisp pastry with poached pears and Harissa spices was simply yummy!That went beautifully with the 2012 Flores de Callejo Tempranillo was smooth rich with hints of tart berries And finally, dessert was a luscious smooth rich yoghurt caramel with a tart tangy strawberry sorbet with an amazing caramel mousse!Excellent all round and definitely worth a visit
4
It is hard to find a place in Singapore to have a good meal and good ambiance. It is even harder to find a place where you can have both of the above at a reasonable price. Alma managed to do both with the tasting menu which the waiter recommended to us.We had a five course tasting menu (the dishes were kept a surprise) which was very enjoyable. It is rare to find a tasting menu in Singapore where you can enjoy every dish and yet keep the cost to around S$100. Only complain was the portions could have been a little bigger
5
A great effort to provide fine food at an affordable rate. Went for tasting menu and was very impressed by the food. Not that it would match a Michelin Star restaurant, certainly not as complex or rich in flavours, but a great shot at offering fine dining. All dishes were well balanced and the 4 of us very much enjoyed all dishes.And @ 108$ the 6 course tasting menu, it is a steal in Singapore, where a steackhouse would charge you as much because they're based at MBS... Or a French Brasserie offering sous-vide precooked Boeuf Bourguignon would whack you on average French wine and would end up charging you more...So good experience on the food and for the rest... Quite a bit of work is required! First of all, atmosphere is pretty mediocre with terrible paints on the wall and old designs (looks like they took over the previous restaurant without bothering on changing decor). And service is, despite great effort from the staff, pretty average. The Sommelier was of no help and the staff a bit clueless at times. So a prefect place for a nice dinner with friends or celebration without breaking the bank. There is no equivalent in mostly overpriced Singapore. Now the restaurant is riding on a great name who probably helped prepare the menu and wine list and it would do better going for more experienced staff in the restaurant
2
It's hard to enjoy your dinner when the first dish of a 'surprise' menu takes 45mins and 1.5 hr later, we're waiting for the 4th (of 6) course. The manager was apologetic and highlighted the issues of multiple diners arriving at the same time m, but the restaurant was only 30% filled. Another staff came to explain that the kitchen had problems and finally yet another staff apologized for sending our order late to the kitchen. Wow no wonder the dishes took such a long time to arrive.In the meantime we had ordered a 3 wine pairing and the first was a fairly decent Spanish sparkling wine but the next wine came at the fourth dish which was a red wine paired with a curried fish dish? Come on, this was bordering on comical and somewhat amateurish. We've been to Alma several times before and it hasn't been this bad. I had time to type this review out in this and several sites while waiting for the dish to come out. I'm told the 3rd wine will pair with the dessert. I'm not holding my breathThe surprise menu was a disappointment - it started reasonably well with beef tartare but the subsequent 3 dishes were similar in style. I guess the only surprise was the lack of imagination by the chef.The Singapore food scene is too competitive to allow for slip ups like this. I may come back again but perhaps in a year or two if it survivesDisappointing.
3
service was great, but the food wasn't up to expectation, more misses than hits, our surprise menu included crab, tuna, salmon, pigeon and a dessert called "brick in the wall" (which was lemony ice cream with some other stuff i can't remember) which generally sums up the experience, passe food that's not very memorable except that it didn't live up to expectation.the crab dish was ok, and so was the salmon, but the rest were not to my taste, the green curry sauce that came with the tuna was the saving grace for the tuna dish, and the pigeon tasted like beef coated with rough salt (think crunching on sand) i was expecting better quality (or at least bigger quantity)restaurant was very quiet too, can't see them surviving very lon

Located in the space formerly known as Thumper at Goodwood Park Hotel, Alma represents the best of modern Spanish interlaced with molecular cuisine and Asian fusion.The decor, atmosphere, plates, glassware and all was a pristine dinning environment, the only challenge being that due to the dark hardwood floors and the bare concrete ceiling, nothing dampened any noise, so it could get quite loud at times, but one cannot be disheartened by the joyous sounds of other patrons enjoying the cuisine. Although we were there as a couple, it was all about the food - so noise wasn't any issue for us.We went for the 8 course dinner - SG$148, and opted for 6 glasses of Wine pairing at SG$68, this alone at any normal restaurant in Singapore is already a good deal, but for cuisine created at this level, techniques and flavorsome complexities is truly a bargain for an amazing culinary journey befitting the most adamant Epicurean!For myself as an ex-Hotelier, this was one of the best dining experiences in a very long time, and very indulgent :)I have a western background and love rich food, but for my lovely wife whom is Asian, the food was a bit rich, but no problem - more for me :-DBe ready for a rich intense culinary journey that will have elevate your taste-buds to the heavens
5
Having your dinner will definitely enhance your appetite to eat more, the food is great, fresh and more importantly, unique.
5
I visit the restaurant twice and it did not let me down every time.
The food is excellent and it is definitely a ideal place for dating and for special occasion celebration.
3
I decide to host a dinner for 5 people total for the festive occasion cum a birthday celebration for a dear friend. Upfront I've mentioned certain food restrictions and also that it was a festive birthday thing. - I was told a candle would be added at the dessert course - I thought it to be a strange thing to say or do. Anyway, at the dessert course, nothing was done to address it was a birthday celebration.The service from the beginning was fine, but deteriorated rapidly towards the end. I've fairly surprised given there were maybe maximum of 4 tables in the restaurant, that the attentive level is pretty low. We ordered cocktails at the beginning, but the cocktails arrived somewhere at the beginning of the 2nd course. And considering we ordered a bottle of $560 bottle of Joseph Phelps Insignia, I thought they would have been more attentive. Even water cups were empty at time with delayed refill after I specifically asked for it.Total bill was $13xx. The only saving grace, is that the food was good across the 6 dishes but the service level for such kind of restaurant is not acceptable. Hope they will improv
5
Went to Alma to celebrate anniversary - by then, the place was just opened a few weeks. The service staff was a bit overwhelmed that night, but the friendliness made that all up.The food was great and I ate one of the best dishes this year "Foie Gras with mango". The prices are very fair & the quality of produce is top. Anytime again
4
My good friends selected this restaurant for our lunch today and it was a real surprise for me - too many restaurants opening up in Singapore nowadays and therefore I do not keep track anymore - but Alma at Goodwood was surprisingly good experience.We tried both the 4 course & 5 course chef's surprise menu.Starters was poached NZ oysters blanketed with a passionfruit sauce & topped with a perfectly chilled cucumber sorbet. Scoop up everything with your spoon and let the flavors meld in your mouth! Instantly reminded me of another memorable meal somewhere in Copenhagen! I was really pleasantly surprised. My 5 course included a seared scallop and sweetbread under a parsley gel and pepper foam - quite different! This was followed by the chicken confit topped with cubes of foie gras & lemony bits. The seared toothfish with cauliflower sauce and coriander oil and cous cous was so deliciously paired. The pumpkin dessert with a chocolate base & slices of orange pumpkin was again quite different - something new to try and appreciate. The service was passable & although he did describe every dish served accurately but without a passion which would perhaps infuse more excitement with the diner. Nevertheless, all in all a very surprisingly delightful lunch with good friends

It's the third time we've been to Alma and the surprise menu continues to be delicious, original and fun. The staff are wonderfully attentive, and have amazed us by making sure that we've never been served the same dishes twice. All have been equally delicious! Add in the wine pairing and you have the recipe to while away several sumptuous hours. Both food and drink are also phenomenal value for the quality

I first reviewed this restaurant during its soft opening and wasn't overly impressed. On this occasion, however, I was overwhelmed as we ate some of the best food we've tasted in years. Deciding not to make decisions (!) we ordered the 'Chef's Surprise Menu,' - 5 courses with wine pairing - and surprise us it did! Our attentive and helpful (but not overbearing) waiter, Wira, took note of the fact that we do not eat fish, and what followed were 'sampling portions of chef's signature dishes in one sitting.' To start we had gazpacho with prawns - amazingly tasty - followed by deliciously prepared foie gras. Next was crispy roast suckling pig, then the piece de resistance - the pigeon in purple curry for which chef Juan Amador gained his third Michelin star. Then to end the feast we enjoyed Crema Catalana. Accompanying these dishes were some excellent wines, each one explained by Wira.The decor in the restaurant has been refurbished and is now a modern, interesting place to dine.I heartily recommend Alma

Restaurant : Alma We are big fans of Spanish new wave of molecular cooking and drawn to Juan Amador's heralded 3 stars and his Spanish ancestry.Ambience :The restaurant took over lock stock and barrel from the previous Gaia. Strange undertaking as usually a top restaurant like its own input of the ambience and decor that it wants to convey to its high paying clientele vs continuing on a failed biz. But Gaia own decor still looked ok to be recycled.Service :The serving staff were inexperienced. When quizzed on the ingedients in the food, you can tell they were basically reciting from a name card. No passion, no enthusiasm nor understanding the philosophy nor the thot process of the chef in creating each and every dish. Other questions beyond that will draw a blank look or I will check with the chef. Also forks were placed upside down etc. Hmm...and no sommelier.Food :The warm bread was okay. But the olive oil and butter were plain and lacklustre. Spain is the biggest producer of olive oil in the world and to serve olive oil that taste like cooking oil doesnt do the Spanish olive oil.We opted for the 4 course dinner plus our own choice of ala carte desert.The first course was fried bread with pork lard and a healthy sprinkling of pepper. First slice was nice but we had just eaten the bread with butter. To eat another 3 pieces of fried bread with fatty pork made us feel uneasy. Strange, no chef's palate cleanser or amuse bouche to start the meal. We were expected to plunge straight into carbo territory? After the warm bread. Not very well thot out.2nd course was foie gras with a slice of radish. Ok, average at best. Nothing to shout about.3rd course was the only saving grace of pan-seared toothfish aka chilean seabass. The fish was well done. Firm, fresh and full of texture.Our final course was the disastrous suckling pig. Two big slices (prob at least 300g) of suckling pig. The skin was supposed to be crackling but it was anything but crispy. It tasted gooey and chewy. All of us returned the suckling pig back to the kitchen relatively in the same condition it came in. The chef's response was that it us not expected to be crispy. Then whats the point of eating suckling pig? Either he is a novice chef trying to find excuses for a mistake? Obvious the suckling pork hasnt been properly dries out prior to grilling resulting in a soggy chewy pork skin. Not by design but by mistake. We hv eaten suckling pig all over Spain incl Catalunya in Singapore and Abac, Commerc 24. None tasted as horrible as this unbiteable pork. Think can get etter tastier roast pork for $5 from any random neighbourhood chicken rice stall.We ordered Pure White and Creme Catalan (pineapple ragout). The pure white was diff kinds s of cheese incl blue cheese etc mixed with milk ice cream, coconut etc. Looked pure white but tasted like baby food after it has been regurgitated. The creme catalon was also bad. The top creme brulee was ok but digging in, the pineapple was stale and lacked the acidity or sweetness of pineapple. If they didnt tell me, i would hv thot they were bland radish.Strangely no petits fours either.Conclusion :This is a poor effort by the people behind this restaurant to do a cheap cut and paste riding on Juan's 3 star billing in Germany. And for a 3 star chef to do a lacklustre offering in a sophiscatedoutpost like Singapore just smacks of ignorance. Singaporeans hv moved on. We were only attracted by good food, not faraway reputation or mu hellin stars alone. This is an unforgetable experience. Poor balance of textures, flavours, tastes and contrasts. This restaurant need to re-examine the real reason (s) for its existence or subsequent non-existence

excellent surprise of a dinner. we took the sampling 5 course menu for 88$. some reflect on the small size of the courses, which is to some extent true, but with 5 of them we still did not feel cheated and that allows for discovery at reasonable price.i like in restaurants compositions and flavors that i do not cook myself and Alma met all expectations. so of course, not all dishes are outstanding, but the originality made the journey very attractive. Kudos to the gazpacho with garlic ice cream; cooking and plating without fault; attentive service. maybe more attention could be brought to salt\spice (i certainly would have salted more my salmon and suckling pig).excellent wine list that goes high up in price but still offers decent choice at entry level (Spanish wines).indeed, the restaurant deco could be a bit more refined.i certainly recommend and need to come back to continue sampling the menu

I‚Äôm a real sucker for the words ‚ÄúMichelin star‚Äù, so when I read that chef Juan Amador of Alma had earned 3 in quick succession, I had to try this place. If you‚Äôre game for surprises, this place is fantastic - many of the dishes represent a sort of ‚Äòunlikely marriage‚Äô. While some of them provoked debate among our group of foodies, others were hands down favorites. It‚Äôs delicious and nothing but great surprises for each dish that we got! Don‚Äôt miss the Yellow Fin Tuna with Shitake mushrooms and green curry, or the special ‚ÄòBeef Tartare a la Chinoise‚Äô.. not forgetting the more traditional Spanish-inspired small plates like Octopus, Chorizo, and Pimientos del Padron. Those who still haven‚Äôt had enough excitement can finish off the meal with a Foie Gras ice cream, or stay in the comfort zone with scrumptious spanish cheeses. For the adventurous palates and the true foodies, Alma is not-to-miss, with an extremely central location. Bravo Chef Christophe Lerouy

Great Food and Experience - my taste buds are awaken by the complexity and tinkling sensations from different flavors and textures.

Great food and ambience! A delightful experience indeed. I would recommend Alma for business as well as for pleasure.

my friend recommend it from his facebook and finally I have chance to visit. It is as good as my friend wrote on his comment on facebook.

I recently had the opportunity to dine at Alma and had a truly excellent experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, wine (both have fantastic options), ambience and the location of the restaurant. I highly recommend the pigeon. A must try restaurant if you're in Singapore. Cheers

ALMA, the new restaurant in Singapore is in one word: "AMAZING". The menu presents two different styles of Spanish food in "Traditional" (Traditionnel) and "Evolution" (Evolucion) by Chef Christophe. I am extremely impressed as both are equally good. I have been back a few more times and for those who are adventurous, try Chef Christophe's special menu (like a degustation menu). On every visit when I request for the special menu, Chef Christophe presents something different and mind-blowing, a genius indeed!Service is excellent and warm. Service staff explains every course when served. Wines list is extensive and of excellent affordability. There are lots of good and affordable Spanish wines, with some Americans, Italians and French to complete the wine list. But what is most impressive is you can also find fine wines like Bordeaux First Growths, Screaming Eagle, aged Armagnac, Calvados and fine Cognac in the restaurant. If you are unsure which wine to order, just ask the staff and they will gladly assist you in pairing the food and wine.Highly recommended

It is very good no denial about this. Big eaters need to think of ordering more portions but that is part of the tapas xperience. I do not like this kind of food (sophisticated without reaching the very high levels) and hotel-based , in a place with no real warmth or soul. But again, undeniably good for those who like this better than comforting authentic local food (my choice....

having seen good and bad reviews - decided to give it a try. The location is very good, just off Orchard Road, easy to park, no reservations required. place had funky music and the tables were well apart. Pretty empty so the place felt very chill and relaxing. Only bad thing was that this place was closed on sundays and when I had emailed them there was no reply so the first time I came here, I had to go back in vain.Food was pretty good value. We had the surprise 5 course menu which left us feeling full and cost $88 which I thought was very worth it. (1) lamb samosa was good but not sure if it was 3-star quality. (2) Scallop and radish was interestingly paired with mustard seed and a miso sauce (3) Salmon with a red wine reduction - absolute best dish of the night (4) the famous pigeon with the purple curry sauce. somehow i thought the sauce was a bit similar to the salmon sauce but interesting nonetheless (5) caramel and yogurt ice cream - light so good but unfortunately forgettable. Overall his food tends to be on the sweet side so good for people with a sweet tooth. Was a bit disappointed with the sangria - have had better. I have to admit that I have been to better restaurants but for the entire package, I definitely think it is worth it. Will be back again whenever I feel like a evening of good food, to chill and relax

We decided to try something new and Alma was a pleasant surprise despite its rather short ala carte mix of tapas and main menus. We wanted a lite easy dinner so we skipped the course menu. The dishes we picked were delicately prepared though - Gambas which was fragrantly prepared in olive oil and herbs, the tooth fish was unexpectedly tastefully paired with subtle curry spices, the award winning pigeon was marinated with a little too much of seasalt flakes but it gave the dish the crispy bite and the meat was succulent. Lastly, the brick-in-the wall dessert, it was the waiter's precise description that prompted us to try - to me it was akin to slightly sweet creme brulee paired with fresh raspberry sorbet and tinge of beetroot sauce. It was wonderful. Overall although the bill was a little pricy but for the menu was worth it

On my recent visit to Singapore I treated myself to a dinner at Alma, one of the latest editions to the Singaporean culinary scene. Knowing about chef Amador, my expectations were high and I was not disappointed. The setting was clean and minimalistic in a way, without being boring. Loved the Miro paintings to give credence to the Spanish heritage of Juan Amador. The food was outstanding, get to share if you are a table of two, if there are more at the table one needs to double up on the dishes! The wine list impressive, the staff going out of their way to make it a memorable evening. We really got impressed when the bill arrived, the best food for reasonable prices. Not otherwise found in Singapore! Hi guys -- see you when I am back again
