Reviewed before but this place has just had a huge facelift, including its food. The decor has gone a bit more upper class and the dishes have been elevated to. Still a great night out with friends. Try the spicy pork belly and Kim-Chi Pancake; amazing!

Visited Manbok with my Korean friends who recommended this restaurant and surprisingly the food taste fared much higher than my expectation. The seafood pancake and bossam are my personal favourites! Will definitely be back again and will recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes Korean food

This place has quickly become our Friday Night hangout. Me and a small group of friends have made it our regular meeting place fro dinner and drinks and have yet to be disappointed. The staff are friendly, their meat is top quality with an array of side dishes and other Korean specialities served on the side. This place is always busy after 7pm and has a great atmosphere. The manager is very personable and always dancing around tables. Charming restaurant that's great for meeting mates and chilling out... try the Kim-Chi Pancake!

We, 3 adults and 2 children, visited this place for dinner on Dec 17, 2016 (Sat).Location and Parking---------------------------Centrally located near Singapore’s Chinatown district, the restaurant is located along a 5-foot-way shophouse unit right next to Neil Road.The nearest MRT stations are Outram Park, Chinatown and Telok Ayer.The nearest carpark are is a small URA one (<20 lots) right next to the restaurant. The next nearest carpark is much bigger. Locate across the road hidden behind the row of shophouses, it was built to accommodate cars belonging to patrons of the pubs and restaurants in the Duxton area. Both are per-minute charging (50cents per 30min, MON-SAT after 5pm and Sun/PH whole day; $1 per 30min otherwise).There are also URA street parking along Bukit Pasoh Rd, Teo Hong Rd, Keong Saik Rd, Jiak Chun Rd, and Teck Lim Rd. (Similar rates as previous carparks, but coupon-parking).Lastly, if one is desperate, you can park at the gigantic sheltered HDB carpark in the Pinnacle Duxton HDB flats, or commercial parking at Craig Place, but the rates are double of those mentioned above.Whether it’s for the carparks or the restaurants itself, come before 6pm if you want space.Ambience & Layout--------------------------The restaurant is air-conditioned, although there are a couple of small outdoor tables (more for the smokers?) right next to the road. The largest indoor table can accommodate up to 8 pax. There are also very spacious 2-seater booths. We sat at a 6-seater.Each table has an unusual periscope-like copper smoke exhaust tube that removes the grill smoke, so that customers dun end up smelling like BBQ meat when they finish their meals! The washroom was dry and clean. The washbasin is outside the toilet and had a nice Asian design.Overall, décor and ambience was nice. Food & Drinks---------------------Dishes we had:1. Appetizers (free) – about 6 types. All were tasty and not too salty. 2. BBQ Set C – Beef and Pork Set ($73) – although described in the menu as meant for 2 – 3pax, the portions were more than big enough for all 5 of us (1 man, 2 ladies, and 2 kids). The meat was well marinated and well grilled by the boss-waiter.3. Spicy Bulgogi Chicken with Cheese ($30) – smooth, delicious and quite spicy. Cheapest of the standalone chicken dishes. Big enough for 5 – 6 pax.4. Cold noodle ($12) – an unusual dish similar to Japanese cold noodles, but in soup form. Big enough for 2 to share.We didn’t order any extra drinks beyond the default Korean cold tea, which was a good calming foil to the strong-taste BBQ food.Unlike the buffet branches at other outlets, the boss-waiter will personally help you to BBQ and even cut and distribute your food to the various table guests. This is also better, as it’s not easy to cook the meat, especially the beef, just right without getting burnt and tough. Service---------Reservations - I recommend making a phone reservations as there are limited tables. They don’t have a website (not even on HungryGoWhere) to make online reservations.Service – efficient and polite. The Korean boss can speak conversational English. There were quite a few local Korean customers, which speaks much about the quality of the food and the customer service
