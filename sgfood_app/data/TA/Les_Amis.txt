If you like traditional french cuisine, this is the place for you. I am more into modern French, so I found this place a bit too traditional. I was really shocked when i saw mini croissant served as petite-fours. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing. We ate in four michelin two stars in Singapore within 5 days. Overall i think the price is a bit too high and less creative compared to other places. Service was great

This is probably the best French restaurant in Singapore, thanks to Executive Chef Sebastien Lepinoy’s insistence to stay truly “French”. We would consider ourselves as ‘regulars’ because the staff could remember our names. The staff here are most well trained, providing a highly professional touch in serving their patrons. Although the prices are going up rather rapidly lately, we continue dine here for its elegant dishes and fabulous services. To maximize the value for money, it is best to lunch here. There are a few set lunch menus but we prefer the à la carte menu where one can choose four courses from more than 24 dishes at a minimum price of S$115 (a few dishes need supplement price ranging from an additional $20 to $30 per dish - you need to read the fine line on the left side of each dish on the menu).Over the months, we have tried almost all dishes on the menu. Every dish is great. You just need to choose your preferred ingredients and the style of cooking to enjoy it. The wine sommelier, Jasmine, would love to recommend wine pairing for you. Given that I need to drive, I always keep my drinks to no more than two glasses. This is a place you must try when in Singapore. The restaurant is awarded two Michelin Stars.

We booked Les Amis based on the recommendation of our foodie friends and our expectations were high. We enjoyed the tasting menu but felt that some of the dishes were a bit underwhelming. We were expecting much more..... Classic decor, very attentive and excellent service, beautiful classic presentation of the food. The standout is the wine list. The wine list is just out of this world AMAZING. The next night we had dinner at The Corner House and that dining experience just blew us away. Please read my review of the Corner House to see the difference

I had contacted Les Amis months prior to my honeymoon to reserve dinner. We were running a bit late the night of our reservation because of jet lag but still made it in time before their last seating. The food was amazing. My husband who hates anything to do with fancy food, especially tasting menus, enjoyed all the dishes. The paired wines were perfect. When I asked for extra bread the manager (whose name is escaping my mind at the moment but I want to make sure gets recognition) packed me an entire French baguette to go! I’m no stranger to nice restaurants but the service here really was impressive. My favorite course was definitely the langoustine. They had a small pre-dessert that was coffee flavored that was amazing. It was really funny because my husband and I were literally having a conversation about how much I like tiramisu as they brought the dessert to our table! The space was in a weird spot sort of on the side of a building but it was beautiful inside. Lastly, they brought out a congratulatory cake for us for our marriage! Everything was great and we left feeling full...which seems to be a trend in Singapore.

We went to Les Amis for my birthday and enjoyed the 4 course a la carte menu. The food was very nice, had good taste and flavours and offered a typical French fine dining experience which one would expect from such a restaurant. The staff were personable and for my birthday made an extra effort to serve us a small birthday cake and chocolates after our meal. The decor and interior is nothing special and if you are looking for a very intimate dining experience I think there are better other places, however if you like French fine dining with a good straightforward style then Les Amis is definitely a restaurant you should try.

I wish I could write a straight-forward thumbs-up review of this restaurant. Honestly, the service was excellent and the food was very very good. In many ways, our expectations were either matched or exceeded. However, I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and I share this as a caution to others who may be booking a table at Les Amis (which I would still encourage you to do).To make a booking online, you are warned that you need a credit card. You are then redirected to Chope - a Singaporean restaurant reservation website. All well and good. I made a reservation and paid SGD100 deposit for two people using my debit card. It felt steep, but I knew this was a special restaurant. Maybe naively, I assumed that this deposit would be deducted from my food bill. It wasn't. So I effectively ended up paying SGD100 more than I expected for our meal. I was willing to put that down to experience and checked with the waiter when my deposit would be refunded. A few days later was the reply.A few days later, no money appeared in my bank account. So I contacted Chope, who contacted Les Amis, who replied:"Pertaining to the request, the dining reservation was made more than a month and thereafter amount was not able to release from our end."They then referred to a 4th party, PAYPAL, who would release the money within 14 working days. This was a straightforward explanation with no apology for the delay. As I pointed out to them, it seems I was being penalised for making my reservation so far in advance. And that is sadly my final memorable experience with this otherwise amazing restaurant (I am still waiting for the refund).Please be aware of this issue if you are making an online booking, especially with a debit card

Dining at Les Amis is what it must be like to dine in heaven. Virtually everything that you experience is sublime. The attention to details makes the experience so memorable you wish you could have this in other resturants. I took my Wife here for her birthday . It felt if the retire resturant was celebrating with us. This is what it must feel like to be royalty 
3
Food was fantastic and yes worthy of 2 stars (not that I was complaining but they over did with the truffles - sometimes that’s all you could taste).Service on the other hand was lacking and definitely not worthy of 1 star let alone 2.....Maybe the judges need to visit again.Would have scored it 5 stars but they do say there a 2 Michelin star establishment and unfortunately the whole experience wasn’t.

We went there for the birthday of my wife. Opted for the Le Classique menu. Firstly, the design and interior is less than optimal. If you're in bad luck, then you have a table close to the door which should not happen in a 2* restaurant. All the time people coming in and out, walking behind your back, and so forth. I had expected more. Secondly, all the portions, I mean all of them, from the first starter to the dessert, are not small but tiny. Really tiny. With the Le Classique menu, you have not eaten enough. That is a sad fact and certainly not what we had expected. This is the first time I have to conclude that the more stars, the smaller the portions. Other 1* restaurants in Singapore give you much better price/quality. Thirdly, it took >30min for them to bring us some breads while they told us from the very first minute they would bring us some. And I had to ask for it twice. Here again, not what you would expect from a 2* restaurant. Except for the bisque, the food was definitely not exceptional. Really surprised by this. To their credit, they did bring a cake for my wife's birthday, a very nice gesture. The chef also came over to congratulate her personally and we each got a small cake when we left. Very nice I must admit. But overall, we had higher expectations and it's not a restaurant we are likely to go again in the future

Slightly over pretentious and portions ever so so delicate! Great flavours and vacharin cheese was the pinnacle. Delightful company ensured an evening not to be forgotten. Would I go back...ummm?
Superb little pastry in presentation box upon departure
5
We ate here for a business dinner and were delighted by every facet of the meal. The wait staff was incredibly attentive. The food....from the bread and butter (yes butter is good enough to get mentioned) to the steak and everything in between.
5
The lady will give a description of the dish when food is served. Meal and service was very good. Although expensive. As we were a party of 7 we had to confirm our meal and price range was from S$185 to S$340. If you have any dietary restrictions they will cater to this even if there is a set menu. They will change it to suit you. Gin and tonic was about S$27 for a glass. Champagne and wine was expensive. This is for those who are up there!!! This was my first most expensive meal.

Our friends have always raved about Les Amis, and so my husband and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the restaurant. I must say I am very impressed with the food and service! We had their Autumn menu, and it was so lovely. My personal favourites were the Brittany Blue Lobster Chartreuse with a fish bone sauce and the Japanese Omi Beef that melts in your mouth. Two thumbs up for the presentation as well! Everything seemed to have a story behind it, from the butter to the plates, it was an eye-opening experience. The service staff were very attentive and courteous. Just before dinner, I pulled a muscle trying to reach for something that fell on the ground, and I must have been touching my back quite a fair bit, as one of the service staff offered me a pillow for my back. When we said our goodbyes, the same service staff asked me how I was feeling and wished me a speedy recovery. I am truly touched by how attentive and concern the service staff was. In short, Les Amis is definitely deserving of the 2-Michelin stars
5
The whole experience was first rate and first class. From the ambiance to the staff to the food, it was excellent. Our group of 4 were given the right level of attention without being too intrusive. The staff were very knowledgeable of what was being served. The wine list was adequate but good. We had the 'Classique' menu. Consist of La Mise En Bouche, Le Caviar, La Langoustine De Loctudy, Le Canard De Challans, La Poire Williams. The quality of the ingredients were the finest and the presentation were artfully laid out, it hurts to even eat them !The total experience was wonderful and we stayed longer than the closing time and there was no pressure to usher us out the door. And we had little door gifts on the way out. A smallish cake that was so delightful for next day's breakfast.I would certainly recommend it for a special occasion or with someone special
5
It was our first visit to Les Amis but definitely not the last. Great ambiance with amazing food and top notch service. The tasting menu was out of this world. Quality of food was excellent and preparation well done. Staff were highly attentive and courteous. I will be back and thoroughly recommend it to others
5
Went there for lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Service is impeccable. They take the trouble to explain what goes into each dish they serve, which is beautifully presented and tastes flavourful. Being a 2-star michelin restaurant, the meal for two of us didnt come cheap but it was worth the splurge for a special occasion
5
Put it this way, there is a reason Les Amis has two stars. It is simply exceptional. The set menu is brilliant and the matching wines are a must. The service, from start to finish is warm and very professional. One of the best dining experiences you will ever have
5
Was finally able to accede to my girlfriend's request of dining at Les Amis and thank god it did not disappoint. We were warmly greeted and ushered to our table and had the menu explained to us by the friendly wait staff. Was impressed with their knowledge of not just the dishes but also the ingredients and their origins. Food was delicious and retains the elements of traditional French cuisine but presented in a modern and contemporary manner. Highly recommended and though it's slightly pricey, it was worth every cent
5
We dined for lunch on Sunday and were absolutely delighted with the food, which appears to ger better each time. The service from Raynond was so excellent that you would think he was the Chef as he was able to recite the origins of each ingredient plus the way the dish was being prepared.Highlights from the Autumn menu Pan seared Duck Foie Gras - about 40grams, a very decent portion. Btittany blue lobster with caviar. Also enjoyed the Camus artichoke and the combination of ingredients that complimented it.Mains - French river salmon - cooked to perfection with the ‘piquillo sauce’ that you simply must soak up with bread. Omi beef - melt in your mouth. And i never knew is tongue and veal sweetbreads could taste so good.Cheese platter was generous-selection of 5 artisan cheeses and so was the apple tarts. The best lunch we have ever had with a very reasonable price tag. Thank you Team Les Amis
5
Nicely executed each and every time, no fancy plating just tasty classics. Service and ambience last Saturday lunch was perfect, only downside is that they don’t have the usual 3 course set lunch on weekends. So menu start from $110++.
3
My friend and I had lunch set , it’s traditional French cuisine too salty for my taste. No surprise. The gift after lunch is beautiful and taste.
4
I was there to celebrate my birthday. Food and service was excellent. What I like was every dish was explained clearly on how each dish was to be eaten. I also like when the chef comes out to meet the diners
5
First time to Les Amis, located in Orchard area. My friend and I were greeted warmly when we arrived. I ordered a glass of their house champagne rose(forgot the name), it was very refreshing and the Indian sommelier is very knowledgeable. We chose the Ala-carte menu which consists with a lot of choices. Patrick is very kind and helpful to recommend some of their signature dishes. Service was swift and unobtrusive. Food was beautifully presented and very delicious too with traditional cooking method. Overall, a great place to be with their warm service, huge wine list and tasty food! Definitely worth a revisit.

So sad that a 2 Michelin Star restaurant does not manage to cater for food allergies ; but still collecting the same price for their tasting menu. Being gluten and dairy free ; I can live with no bread but in all honesty how difficult can it be to make gluten free bread if you have been informed upfront ?!? We make it ourselves at home and we aren’t Michelin Star rated chefs! Some of the appetizers were only given to my husband - again, you have 2 Michelin stars - shouldn’t you be a bit more creative and do something ?? And then the desert - a fruit salad - are you joking - is there a chef in your kitchen? I make my own desserts and it works so don’t give me the explanation that it’s challenging .. your pastry chef should jump on a challenge like this instead of cutting some fruits. And then the gift to take home for breakfast - again not gluten free and your staff gave it to me stating “here’s our gift , well sorry not for you ; just watch your husband eat it” If you can’t handle dietary requirement then don’t accept the booking but clearly collecting our money was more important than giving us a great evening and customer service. You should be ashamed.

We ordered the 8 course Autumn menu ($340++). Shavings of White "Alba" truffle was served with several dishes; unfortunately we felt that the pairing was not good and it was a waste. White truffles on chestnut veloute- too sweet, we felt that a savory dish would enhance the truffle flavor better. White truffles on cold angel hair pasta - the pasta was sour with too much acidity - another mismatch. White truffles with gnocchi which was an ok pairing but the gnocchi was tasteless.The portion sizes for each course is about the size of a 50 cents coin - the lobster, scallops and the venison dishes. The venison course was half foie gras and half venison meat which probably weighs 20 grams. For ladies with small appetites, this menu will probably fill you, but for normal appetite ladies and males, be prepared to proceed elsewhere for supper or you just have to load up on the bread. Please Chef, for the price paid you could at least serve a decent portion size. We have been to Can Roca, Arzak, Extebrri etc and many other starred restaurants in Europe and portion sizes are never like this. And they cost much less.Service was pedestrian. The sommelier is probably knowledgable but lacks personality. Our server was like a student memorising and regurgitating his lines. The only strong point of Les Amis is its comprehensive wine list of very expensive wines.Haven't been to Les Amis for several years. It used to be better. Disappointing and will not return
2
I just wish we could have enjoyed the food in the manner others have described. Despite making our reservation months ago, the team were obviously not prepared for us and my wife's allergies.When we sat down, they offered me an appetiser but said my wife would be unable to have one. Similarly with bread, they gave a similar answer :we cannot do anything for your wife"We asked what will happen with dessert and the similar response was "we can give her fruit"The basic response was "we are French and there is little we can offer"Having been to most of the world's top restaurants (including in Paris), the normal response was "no problem"We have wonderful restaurants of visits to Can Roca and Osteria Francescana where they offered the most amazing desserts.We don't have a problem if they prefer not to serve those with wheat and dairy allergies - but the better approach would be to more upfront and say at the time of booking that they may find it difficult to look after us totally.Don't accept the booking and hope we will accept a second rate compromise.The good news is we rang Blackwattle who said "no problems" and with 5 minutes notice gave both of us a wonderful meal
5
Les Amis is an amazing french restaurant. The food is beautifully presented and tastes amazing, fully of flavour with a lot of creativity in the presentation. We went there 3 x times as it was just beautiful food, the chef and staff are just lovely and fantastic. Definitely recommend you try this restaurant for french food, fine dining
5
The Michelin Guide is always highly regarded in the food nerd world.Les Amis, the two Michelin-starred restaurant is one of the hotspots of Singapore. For memorable tastes matched with superb service, Les Amis offers French cuisine served in a hushed but enjoyable atmosphere. The flamboyance lies in the dishesBook well in advance to have a chance at getting in. What more to say? This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
Reasonable and very affordable price for a 2 Michelin starts restaurant with good service, ambience and dining experience.A-la-carte set lunch is at $108 (3 course + 1 dessert)What I had: Camus artichoke and white tuna belly salad, pan seared duck foie gras with grapes & almonds, pan seared river salmon with piquillo sauce (the doneness of the salmon is so perfect, I like it very much) + vanilla warm soufflé and ice-creamChef recommendation set lunch (degustation menu) is at $205 (5 course + 1 dessert), coffee/tea at additional $8, wine pairing available too at $140/person.I didn't have wine pairing, I choose sea-bass as mu main course
5
Best french restaurant I have ever trued, apparently the operate since 1994 and they were the first french restaurant (and first fine dining restaurant!) to open in Singapore. Food well prepared and fresh, classic french recipes and great variety. Really good service as well.
5
We recently dined at Le-Gavroche in London, and I'm writing this review for Les Amis again, as our last dining experience in May to celebrate Mom's 82nd Birthday here outshines Le-Gavroche by miles. Both are two star Michelin restaurants, mind you. What makes Les Amis extra special is the genuine service we receive each time we dine. Jasmine from the Sommelier's team was so pleasant and knowledgeable, and made the bunch of us, wine lovers, very happy! Of course, every single dish was also simply delicious. You really cannot go wrong with you selection. Les Amis is simply the best of the best. If you haven't been here, you simply must. Just made a reservation for next month
5
This is not the type of place you would go for a regular meal. But if you want to go for an exceptional treat, certainly a great option. While i had somewhat mix feeling with the starter (blue lobster, a veloute and caviar), due to the veloute which i felt a bit heavy on taste, what followed was special. A langoustine that seemed more size like a langouste from Brittany accompanied by a subtle sauce. This was followed by duck that melted in your mouth, a perfect selection of well ripe cheeses and an elaborate desert. This valse of tasted was enhanced with the right wine pairing. Service was flawless and attentive. A lovely dinner that will stick to our memories for many years to come.
5
On a long week end trip me and my friend we fancy ticking boxes of "best bar in world" and "best restaurant" being in singapore for F1 we wanted to go in michelin star restaurant hence we had booked les amis.The decor is simple yet so comfortable you wont find fanciness here but when the manager welcomes you he clearly states that here we are casual which makes you fell home.The staff is so nice and warm.Most importantly: the food is top notch and eventhough some meals look simple (dover sole) they are cooked perfectly with impressive dressings. Pur favorite were the langustine with caviar on top and the scallopChef preferred champagne is very nice as well.We were honestly amazed by the food and even more as we were treated as familly that can stay 3h having lunch without having pressure or attitude you may have in other places.Higly recommende
5
went there to have lunch with my wife, the experience was really memorable, the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. the location is very very good and it was just a few steps from our hotel. they have this set menu and really worth it price wise 
5
This is a truly great dining establishment. It well deserves its 2 Michelin stars. I had the Tasting Menu for lunch together with a 1/2 bottle of burgundy. It started with a selection of breads and French butter, then an amuse-bouche. The next four servings were: (1) cold angel hair pasta with caviar & truffle, (2) langoustine, (3) pan seared duck foie gras, & (4) French river salmon, all followed with the main course of Roasted Duck with spring turnip. Then dessert, of course. The service and ambiance could not be better
4
Selected this place to host a special meeting in their enclosed private room. The lunch menu was different from usual. This is the first time I visited this Restuarant though it was mentioned by word of mouth that it is good but very expensive. The service is great and perfect and the food presentation is good. Nothing to complain as each dish was done so exquisitely that you just need time to enjoy it. I love the side dish more than the salmon main course. You can see each dish was especially crafted for the guests. Will consider this again for executive hosting again.
3
Excellent service - however the waiters I had that particular night was not very well versed on the menu items that was being served. Food was good - but overkill on the butter. I felt every dish was orientated around butter. Granted I have never tasted better table butter than at les Amis, but to put butter in all their dishes really makes it way,too heavy. French food is known to be heavy, but this was butter overkill. Butter was the theme of the night with all dishes surrounding around their butter. And this is what makes it unacceptable. And lastly the location. Oddly fitted restaurant. Wish it was better located. View outside of traffic jams of taxis is not very pleasant to go with my meal.I would put this a borderline 1 michelin star. I say the price is,fair for what they are,offering and what the restaurant is. Just,cut down on the butter! And better music selection - cliche/pop classical music selection cheapens the ambianceWould come back to try lunch next time
5
Nice small French restaurant. Order set lunch. Appetizer and fruits salad are good but come with small portion. Main course for seared salmon is good but in rather small portion. Very generous with the offering of nice bread. Apparently to make sure customers do not go away still hungry !! Modern decoration. Comfortable and clean. Relaxing atmosphere. Good place to dine. Servers are professional, polite and quick to serve. Like this place for lunch.
5
Decided to treat myself to a good lunch on my last day in Singapore a chef friend of my in Australia recommended the restaurant.Had a booking at 12 pm chose the a la carte formula and the wine recommended on the llst half bottles, the first the course was the crab dish and then had the langoustine hot starter with sauce was excellent both dishes were outstanding flavoursome ,my main was the ris de veau well cooked plus it's jus .For desert I had the cheese platter to finish my red wine,and an espresso coffee.The meal and wine was not cheap but it was worth every cents, service was impeccable could not falter great wine list ,if you are interested in great French meal in Singapore do not miss this restauran
5
We had the seafood menu and it was just perfect from the amuse bouche to the end.
Great service , friendly staff .
Go there without hesitation .
5
The food is absolutely amazing both in its look and taste. We tried too different types of menus and we love them both. The cheese is the best I have ever tried. The service is incomparable which makes this experience lifetime memory.
5
Fabulous food, amazing wine and excellent service!
The sommelier, Pillar, was awesome. Thanks for a great night.
5
Set lunch is perfect - they promise one hour , four courses, good value. Was worried about what they would offer but food was good albeit one didn't really have a good selection. Highly recommended !!!
5
 Les Amis is definitely the best restaurant in Asia. The service and food is all top notch.  Firstly, I had the cheese balls, which were amazing. The pastry was light and the cheese did not affect the taste.  Then, we had the welcome course. There was a crispy shell, and underneath there were tomato sauce and jelly. I loved the idea of breaking the shell and scooping up everything in one bite.  Afterwards, I had a crispy crab pastry with caviar and tuna. It was really refreshing and delicate. After eating the crispy crab pastry, I had a lobster wrapped in baby spinach leaves. It was truly amazing to see the blend of elegance in design and taste as it was delicious.  Lastly, I had a apricot layered dessert with a crispy sugared shell. I like that the dessert is special and could not be found anywhere else.  I will like to commend the choices of wine in the restaurant and also the Sommelier, who was helpful and described the bottle of wine with visual aid, which was interesting
5
6 star service and food. We had a wine pairing dinner which cost us about USD$700 for two person.A little gem hidden by the side of Shaw Tower, this Michelin restaurant has been around for years. The wine pairing was to the point, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. We ordered the Le menu ete, and it was delicious. The duck foie gras was 'succulent' and the lobster wrapped in zucchini was to die for. Nothing I would fault them for. But it does comes with a price tag :
5
I had enjoyed a great night my date at Les Amis with great service and delicious awesome food on 8 of August. We had ordered the four courses menu at $188 but we didn't expected that the menu serve more than four dishes. Love all the dishes and we will be back again soon!
5
The restaurant interior was quite plain and bland, however the food amazing! A well deserved 2 star rating!I found that fine dining is quite expensive in Singapore- however the quality of food during dinner was spot on. We had a great experience with the sommelier giving us the most insightful knowledge on everything about wines and how to pour it etc. We were even treated to a "back stage" tour to see the kitchen and wine cellar. This Sommelier was the best one I've come across in the world- he was fun, knowledgeable and had a personality
5
We had a fabulous 5-course menu of refined Michelin starred French food. Langoustines, foie gras, spider crab and duck notable standouts. However, the best thing about Les Amis is the brilliant and fairly priced wine list. It may not be the most exciting place, it's certainly more refined than it is buzzy, but if you want really good food, great wine and a place to chat easily with you companions, then Les Amis is a top choice.
5
I was positively surprised how good the food was. The portions seem small but in the end you really do feel full. Les amis bakes their own bread and you can choose between baguettes, brioche or bread with raisins (which is my favourite!). They bring you complimentary appetisers which taste like heaven. We took 2 different set lunches and were not disappointed. The service is good, the personal is very attentive and responding. As it's a Michelin star restaurant, it's more on an expensive side but if you have a good excuse to celebrate something, you won't regret coming there. I was told that the menu usually changes every month so I'm looking forward to treat myself to another delicious lunch at Les amis
4
Very good place for a customer dinner. This is not cheap but service and menu are outstanding. Make a reservation as few tables available.
5
One of the best dinning experience I have had in the recent years; the restaurant does not disappoint in delivering one of the best cuisines we have tasted.
Would definitely return back for another experience.
5
went back with family and friends for a birthday celebration in may after the Chinese new year celebration in jan... and again the foods and wines were simply delicious... and as always the staff was so pleasant too... thank you
4
Dinner for 2 people.
Space is a little odd for what is a very traditional style of restaurant but works well enough. Food excellent (though they went a bit overboard on their asparagus promotion). Service great and winelist intimidatingly long.
5
Food was delicious. Service was perfect. Best dining experience ever! Creative dishes all appealed to my taste. No unusual ingredients !
5
I must say the crew in Les Amis are very well trained and food has overall met our expectation. Where Michelin star is given in gourmet, there are certainly no doubt of what you pay is what you will be getting. Quality of food, freshness and of course prepare to get your taste buds entice by the chef. One thing I am really impressed and wish to highlight is the service my partner and I received. Service overall is immaculate and positive. Where many compared Odette and Les Amis, my call is..ditch Odette (food is rather on Par, service is like Macdonald) and try Les Amis.
5
They kindly sat us in the private room with a window to the kitchen. Had the Le menu crustacÃ©s $250 and Le menu printemps $320 and a few bottles of wine (Domaine Charvin - Chateauneuf du Pape 2007; Marchesi Di Gresy - Camp Gros Martinenga 2001 ; Achaval Ferrer - Finca Mirador 2009). All three are fantastic!The service is immaculate, the experience is awesome, food is unique and heavenly.Total cost $500/ person. Will return
5
Try this For a French experience. We had a group of 10 and had the crustacean menu. Great produce and all French and sourced from over the world. Many dishes had top caviar served and the presentation was amazing. Excellent selection of complementing French wines. The service and explanation of food was exceptional.
5
Les Amis has been synonymous with fine dining and it's amazing that it has been maintaining that consistency throughout the 20+ years.My wife and I visited this institution for lunch and again we came out happy. We appreciated the effort that went behind the scenes of which they were built over the years, from dish origination, presentation, sourcing of ingredients, wines (which their inventory was simply one of the most comprehensive in this country and they have a retail shop upstaris), and the pairing.The skills and arts of doing it is not simply about making dishes with expensive and exquisite ingredients, but to create an experience, a story that patrons can understand. Les Amis is one of the few restaurants that can articulate that and in doing so seemingly so effortless - this is the difficult part.We liked the space and decorations of the place, we liked coming for lunch when we could feel the warmth of the sunlight and took a bit longer to enjoy the experience. Wait staff and sommelier were competent and friendly; they seemed to like what they were doing with a sense of pride and we could feel that from our conversations and their body language.It is a special place of culinary experience and it's a testament in itself that they have been doing that day in day out
5
Everything about this restaurant is excellent. The moment I stepped in, the staff greeted well and served a group of us professionally. Service is simply superb.The food is simply delectable, right from the start. The moment we sat down, we were provided with cheese puff and a basket of freshly baked bread with specially made butter. These little extras really brought a surprise for diners. The cheese puff was bursting with delicate cheese aroma and flavor, just a delicate tickle to your palate for next following extra ordinary dishes.I selected the set meal with 4 course, comprising hot and cold appetizer, main and dessert. With my companion diners, we really enjoyed having different sets of meals and all of them are out of the world! Each dish was crafted carefully, presented aesthetically pleasing and tasted delectable, each ingredient was seasoned perfectly, that we did not anything else to add other than a clear palate. Please refer to my photos for some of special dishesThe serving of each dish was presented professionally by the servers. Servers could deliver the introduction of the dish, type of and source of the ingredients. As we came with the party of six, we were given a round table. The ambience of restaurant is bright yet not stark, each table is spaced out that you can see crowd yet not noisy.Overall experience is so exceptionally fantastic
5
It was an amazing experience. Pleasing to eyes and taste buds with excellent service from staff. No wonder it has lasted 23 years. Definitely recommend it to others.
4
Service was OK and food was good but not as great as the price. Maybe my choices were not the right Ines but still tough to swallow. Still a sure thing if you have the budget.
5
This is excellent!!
The service is great and very attentive.
This restaurant has excited for 25 years - prove of Quality.
Food is like sex :-) - good sex :-)

We absolutely enjoyed the whole evening, delicious food, great Sancerre and perfect staff service (the canadian guy is top and speaks perfect French). We appreciated the stressless atmosphere and the "thx-box". We'll go back during our next stay in Singapore.

Loved the service and ambience during lunch service here. The cold angel hair pasta with caviar and kombu is certainly a great dish, but the latter courses failed to impress although were all well prepared and could have used a touch more acidity and balance.

What's there not to like about Les Amis? The ambience is wonderfully romantic, service is impeccable and dishes to die for... and you pay a handsome price for it all!This is our special occasion place for dining. It's menu is similar to the Japanese Omakase style with specially planned dishes dependent on what's the special of the day. I love that every time I go there, I eat something different and uniquely prepared. The bread tray and butter is phenomenal! Wines and cocktails surprisingly affordable. Depending on which menu you choose, you might think the food is not sufficient... so that where the bread tray comes in... Highly recommend for special occasions and if you feel the need to splurge..

We were there for an anniversary lunch. We made a reservation and was showed to our table immediately. It was an intimate restaurant with a quiet and romantic ambience. The staff were very attentive to your needs and would explain every single dish in lots of details. The food was fantastic! Not just were they delicious, they were always very well presented and much thought have been put into designing the menu.The black truffle dishes are a must try.Lastly, I just also want to say that the desserts were OUT OF THIS WORLD and were definitely the prettiest things i have ever seen. You gotta try it to believe it

Les Amis is the kind of restaurant that does not blow you away but is extremely enjoyable and keeps drawing you back again and again. The food served is classical French with top ingredients that are mostly imported. Service and ambiance is good, location is convenient for both locals and tourists in Orchard road. Cooking is consistently stellar with little flaws though I will also say that I have rarely been wowed by any dish here. Overall though, this place is a classic in the Singapore culinary scene

We were a group of 5 people. reserved one of their private room upstairs. Restaurant setting is so pretty and service is detailed. Food was great, maybe a little bit conservative in the creative way and platting but food was great overall. We ordered one of their degustation menu which was good. Their wine list is very good with maybe one of the biggest choices you got in Asia. One thing was not good enough was that , when I asked that can they also turn on the Background music a little bit in the private room because it was a little bit too quiet in the room, it took a very long time and it still wasn't fixed. For a fine dining restaurant, background music is very important for a overall nice dining experience. In the corridor, I expected their background music to be more delicate and carefully chosen but turned out not. Not sure if they have any special music consultant there or just chose the music by themselves. Anyway, No any complaint other than this
5
Lunch at Les Amis is a real treat from start to finish. A fantastic menu that while delicious, won't leave you too full but that was absolutely fine for our group who were also very happy to focus on the wine cellar as much as the kitchen! The front of house staff are simply excellent and made all of us feel very special indeed. Highly recommended and I am greatly looking forward to our next visit!
5
I can't praise this restaurant enough. Superb services from all staff, amazingly delicious food. So deserving of their 2 Michelin stars. There is no view but that didn't bother us at all. One of the best restaurants I've been to.
5
Visited Les Amis with my wife and a friend.
In short the food, the service and the ambience were all outstanding!
Would highly recommend a visit if you are in Singapore.
5
We have been coming to Les Amis for more than 15 years, but this was the first time after they got their 2 michelin stars. We went for a Sunday lunch for a family celebration, and were given a private room, which was a nice touch. We had the Le menu Formula a la carte, which excellent choices, excellent food, and one of the best wine lists in town at quite reasonably prices. The staff was competent and pleasant! Portion sizes were just right, and all our guests came away with a most memorable dining experience. Must get back to try the dinner soon. Highly Recommended
5
Dined for lunch and choose the al la carte menu for $108 which was 3 dishes (cold entree, warm entree and main) plus dessert. We choose 8 different dishes between the 2 of us and some of the standout dishes were the foei gras, scallops and sugar sphere). Other dishes were great as well including amuse bouche and breads. Most impressive was the service provided to us by the wait staff. Felt privileged to be treated that warmly in a fine dining establishment. So happy that we dined at this restaurant and highly worthy of the 2 Michelin stars this restaurant had earned.
5
In the range of the top , this is the most consistent place since the last 12 years .My business is bringing me tithe best place in Asia , an therefore I am able to rate the most consistent quality food over the last 12 years _Food , innovation, creativity,quality,services,attention to details, and clientelism is by far the best over the year . The place to go either for business or for family lunch or dinner

We have been dinning here since the mid nineties when there were few French fine dining restaurants in Singapore. Recently we came here to celebrate a birthday for 7 pax during Sunday lunch and have another great experience. It was wonderful that we were given a private room. The entire experience is uncontrived, spontaneous and unpretentious. The ambience, service, food and wine are best of class, beyond 2-Michelin-Star. We had the Le menu formula a la carte, which is 3 courses + dessert + petit four + coffee/tea for $108++ For the hot and cold starter there is a wide choice of 6 selections each. You could have two hot or two cold starters as you wish. We have a bottle of Pailllard Rose and Henschike 2014 Henry's seven. With the supplementary charges for selected starters and mains, the bill come out to be slightly above S$200 per head. Highly recommended for special celebrations, and of course they 'surprise' us with a delicious birthday cake too

This place has been here for 23 years and most courses arrive under a silver dome. We were there for lunch and had the six course truffle menu. Wonderful!! The first course, one of their signature courses, cold angel hair pasta with caviar and black truffle was created by the original chef. It has been reinterpreted by each subsequent head chef. It was powerfully flavorful. The second was langoustines from Brittany served in a buttery olive oil emulsion. The celery in a subsequent course was shaped like a ball with a generous amount of truffle. We chose the beef course for our main. Tiny soft slices prepared perfectly. One could have chosen a pheasant dish instead. Service was smooth. The wine choices ample. It was a wonderful experience

As suggested by our clients based in Orchard Road, we had tried Les Amis for lunch. Most of us selected their SGD98++ Prix Fixe menu which offers 3 courses plus 1 dessert.In general, service was attentive.But when taking our orders halfway, one server abruptly left our table.Apart from this initial hiccup, service was good for the rest of our meal.We get to select 2 appetisers and 1 main course. Certain choices require supplementary cost.We tried the crab served in a small roll with caviar (excuisite taste of crab meat blended well with juicy bursts of caviar, although the roll could have been larger), pan seared duck foie gras and french river eel with citrus compote and dashi (flawlessly executed and one of the finest foie gras I have ever tasted). Main course was french river salmon served two ways (slightly grilled and tartare like and both textures of flaky and tender, contrasted well).Dessert was ring of baked apples on spiced biscuit with cinnamon ice cream (this was a decadent dessert but they could have used apples which were not so sour).Their offering of various bread selection were utterly divine with a soft spiral one which tasted of buttery croissant. One was shaped as a mini baguette).The lunch with 2 half bottles of wine cost around SGD950, for 6 of us.Les Amis' gifting of an impressive metallic square tin of jelly sweets to each of us diner was an unexpected treat, which we welcomed and appreciated.Recommended for consistently high quality contemporary French cuisine from a stalwart restaurant which has stood the test of time, in Singapore.This is attested by Les Amis (which opened in 1994) being recently awarded Asia's 16th Best Restaurant 2017 by San Pellegrino & Acqua Panna
5
The food is outstanding and the presentation is beautiful. Service was superb. There are only pre-fix options so plan to be there for awhile. We had expected an a-la-carte options so we were a little thrown off. However, we ventured forward and loved it.FYI as of this writing the lowest was around $175.00 SD per person
5
Pleasant decor, perfect service, outstanding food.Why didn't I come before here during my many previous trips to Singapore? Always looking for new Chinese/Asian restaurants, I mistakenly missed the pleasure of experiencing at Les Amis quality French food of a level difficult to find even in France in these days.And the wine list is fantastic too
4
Food was well prepared and cooked to perfection! Definitely a place for celebration and showing loved ones you love them
3
but probably not a place i would go back to.
it's a very decent french restaurant, but i think now there are other options of great, amazing places to eat in Singapore.
the foie gras was cooked to perfection, though.
5
Singapore businessmen and celebrities take their guests in this restaurant to impress them. Interior of a classic baroque chandeliers and long tables, wine list includes 200 names, and chef Sebastien Lepine famous quails with the classic Provencal ratatouille and cakes with tomato jam.

Michelin guide has encouraged mediocrity in this part of the world. While the food is good it does not deserve the rating nor can it be compared to other 1 or 2 stars restaurants we have experienced elsewhere. Many other restaurants without ratings can produce similar if not better experience. The service while friendly and attentive is not exceptional. Gone are the basics of serving from the right and clearing from the left. Does the location or ambience deserve 2 stars? We don't think so. We had the menu classique and the only stand out dish was the turbot - cooked just right. The Grand Marnier soufflé was underwhelming - a decent home cook can produce easily
4
After living in Singapore for 13 years you may have thought that I would have been to Les Amis one of SG's few 2 Michelin star restaurants but I had not at least until last Sunday.We had a delightful time, Sunday lunch at 12pm, we spent more than 2 enjoyable hours there, and after a 13km walk in the morning I was really looking forward to the meal.Service was friendly, eager and courteous at all times and never stopped coming to see if everything was in order, freshly cooked bread rolls kept on coming up and iced water too, with thought having too ask.The girls all dressed up and looked lovely and we had a lovely meal Le Menu Formule with a great Barossa Red. The food was served fresh and promptly the food was delicious and memorable.If you have a special Occassion please do go along.Note men in shorts will not be admitted

Simply amazing food that you really have to experience. Our favourites were "La tarte a la truffle noire" (truffle tart) "La langue de Veau" (Veal tongue) "La toute de Faisan" (Pheasant) and "Le pigeon au sang" (Pigeon) Flavours, taste and presentation of every single dish was simply outstanding.And even better, was the wine list! Raymond, the head Sommelier was professional, knowlegeable and very pleasant to chat with. We have a bottle of champagne, Rose from Provence, Sancerre and lastly a Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Les Amis must have one of the most extensive wine lists in the whole of Singapore. Reasonably priced too, I may add.We were a party of eight persons, and the restaurant was full, however, the service we received by Murugan and his team was really flawless. Timing, body-language and professionalism was simply immaculate.We were agreeable that this was one of the best meals we have ever had! Les Amis deserves 2-star Michelin, for sure, and why not 3 ?!?!Lastly, thank you Royston for organizing such a memorable meal. We can't wait to come back
5
I went here for lunch with a friend and it was amazing! We had the 4-course lunch menu, and half a bottle of pinot noir. It was very lovely - from the amuse-bouche to the dessert. I had the le crab en frivolité (which was as lovely as the photo) for my first starter, the scallop&caviar, pigeon breast and the soufflé. The restaurant was full that day but the service is still good. I got my money's worth for sure.
5
My husband and I didn't have a reservation but were able to get us a table. This is restaurant is at the high end. We were greeted and served by very informative staff. We couldn't fault the food at all. We can honestly say we left the restaurant stuffed.The only feedback that we would give is about the 75 page wine menu. My husband and I like to the grape and a brief description of the wine. Apart from that it was very good
5
A choice of three set menus at different prices... we had the middle priced one at $95 pp which was very good value. A choice of 6-8 dishes for each course and the food was technically very well done and the taste of everything we ate was superb!In addition we had an amuse Boucher of lobster and truffle and coffee with petit fours at the end.Great service and the restaurant was full. Highly recommend it but make sure you give yourselves enough time, the experience is enhanced if you don't rush the process
5
Dinner for 2 on 2 January, had the classic (set) menu with wine pairings, and despite a hefty bill, left happy after an excellent meal and service. It's a lovely pared back room, and the food was truly good. We both opted for a main course of sweet breads, which was superb. Another highlight was desert consisting of Grand Marnier souffle accompanied by an orange flavoured ice cream and paired with a sweet desert wine that smacked of marmalade. It sounds very sweet, but it wasn't. Coldness and zest of the ice cream cut through everything nicely. A minor fault in the service was that when I visited the gents, all the towels to dry my hands had been used. And I though having sugar served in paper sachets was ascetically discordant. But we left, two happy customers. A very odd thing was that we two European men were at a row of tables for two, with young couples, far more occupied with looking into their smart phones, than looking at, talking to or otherwise communing with each other. Very odd
5
Great truffle menu lunch with top quality produce and ingredients. Wine sommelier was very knowledgeable and helpful too. Fantastic dessert. Was world class
5
Having read and heard lots about this place, we went with fairly high expectations and that were pleasantly met. Service was attentive and the food for all courses were good, both in presentation and in taste. I especially liked the clementine dessert.
5
By far the best service either for the food or for the wines - food is constantly outstanding and private room perfectly shaped for business lunch - location is perfect - it is extremely bizarre this amazing restaurant does not get 2 Michelin stars
4
If you are happy to pay 300 to 350 SGD per person, the food is great, true French restaurant with great service and great food. There are other good French restaurants in Singapore but that one has fantastic food (had 7 courses meal), private rooms for business lunch or dinner, great wine selection (10 times the price for the same bottle back in Europe). In short, highly recommended
5
I brought my parents to celebrate their 50th anniversary on Christmas Day.The ambience was excellent. The only downside is it's location between Shaw Centre and Pacific Plaza. Cars often hoot when queuing into Shaw Centre.Service was exemplary. Pleasant. Friendly. Not stiff. Floor staff mainly Asian. Even the Indian waiter tried a few Mandarin words with my mainly Mandarin speaking parents.We had the Menu Signature. Every course was good. Some excellent. The food was innovative traditional rather than too modern. Not too deconstructed or molecular. I have been to Les Amis several times, the first after Chef Sebastien Lepinoy took over. It is certainly worth repeat visit and deserving its two Michelin stars
3
Les Amis is elegant, well staffed, and provides excellent personal service. They see you and make sure you feel it. So when your meal is over, you remember how helpful and attentive the staff were, and you are happy to return. The Amuse bouche was a lobster bisque which was outstandingly yummy with Tarragon to zest it up. The Mushroom tart was a complex construction with a good mix of different mushrooms on filo pastry, but a tad bit over salted. The Foie gras slice with sesame topping was thick n generous, well finished with the right accompaniments. Their Lobster ravioli was well balanced and simply delicious. The Pigeon with foie gras was excellent. The Steamed Lobster wrapped with spaghetti turned out to be bland and could be improved. I decided to be courageous enough to order what I was told to be their signature dish - Ox tongue with calves head! This turned out to be a collagen treat!! It was very gelatinous, exotic, complex n gamey all at the same time, and prettily and colourfully presented - but this dish is an acquired taste. Better if eaten with Dijon mustard.
5
On a last visit of the year through Singapore, coinciding with my birthday, I and a good friend enjoyed a quite sumptuous dinner treatLes Amis has long held the mantle as one of Singapore's best if not the best restaurant.It did not disappointThat was a stunning meal to celebrate an almost another year younger!The service was impeccable with wonderfully attentive staff.The amusing bouche of a rich sep mushroom and chestnut broth with a Parmesan foam was unctuous and yum!The langoustine raviole with caviar and white truffle was superbly scented, woods and earth on a plate.The roasted line caught sea bass with leeks and grapes with a Perigord verjus was simply to die for.The glazed Pork belly with crispy onions melted in your mouth.The finale was a pistachio soufflÃ© and then a rich luscious surprise birthday mousse!The dark green palate cleansing herbal sorbet was an explosion of basil, coriander, lemongrass and mint, delish!After the French gin martini, a glass each of the 2014 Domaine Weinbach Riesling followed by the 2011 Hospice Beaume du Volnay 1st Cru Burgundy, it was time for bed.Simply well deserving it's 2 Michelin stars and a spot as one of Asia's best restaurant

I wanted to surprise my wife on our first night of our honeymoon. I thought that a trip to a lovely restaurant would do the trick. After researching a few different restaurants, Les Amis stood out and I'm glad it did. Upon arrival at Les Amis, the staff were incredible. From when we sat down the staff accommodated every request we had including altering the menu as my wife couldn't have seafood. They assisted us in matching wine to recommending selections on the menu. The atmosphere was amazing with lovely chandeliers hanging, classical & light jazz music playing and lovely ambient lighting. The food was absolutely incredible. The fresh produce, the flavours and the creations. C'est Magnifique! We told the staff it was our honeymoon during the night and they were kind enough to write a special note on the side of the dessert plate stating congratulations and the chef came out to wish his kind regards. All in all a beautiful night and we will definitely be back in the hopefully not so distant future! Thank you Les Amis!

We informed the restaurant beforehand that we would be bringing our two young kids along for dinner, and they were more than happy to accommodate us. We were given a private room upstairs overlooking the main dining hall, which we appreciated as we did not want to bother other diners. We had the 6-course degustation, which we thoroughly enjoyed. My birthday chocolate cake was the best dessert I had eaten in ages. The kids were treated like royalty with all-you-can-eat pasta, fries and even tiny chocolate balls, which the server noticed they enjoyed from my dessert. Service was truly impeccable and genuinely sincere, nothing was too much of a trouble
5
Visited with a party of friends. Excellent food and loved the attentive but reserved service. Faye asked for either a bottle of Vouvray or a nice Riesling. The sommelier whispered in her ear that he had no Vouvray but would see what they had in their cellar. What he produced was a Riesling of wonderful quality that Faye simple fell in love with so much so that we are searching for a supplier in the UK.An excellent restaurant well worthy of their 2 Michelin Stars
5
We chose this more formal setting due to the occasion and were not disappointed -
There were three fixed menus only, this makes it easier to decide which "suite" you would like to follow.
5
Just went back for lunch and tasted their Le Menu- amazing food and service! Worth the while to be back!! Worth every penny!!
5
Live up to its 2 Michelin star image. Excellent service and every course well explained. Even though we were so full we stayed for the desserts which lived to its expectations. All the food were well presented.
5
I visited here for luch.
Service was good and the taste was excellent.
Every single dish was well explained.

Lovely dinner, amazing service, food presented so beautifullly! Absolutely delectable..a wonderful happy experience. Fabulous wine selection! Coming from a true New Yorker. Loved!

We rated this place as average because the restaurant had its good points and areas for improvement. Good: 1) service was good though it was rather shaky at the beginning. 2) they remembered my birthday though I rebooked after cancelling it, without stating it was a Birthday celeb in my second request. Improvement: 1) staff needs to know how to pronounce the french ingredient properly and introduce dishes properly - not just french scallop or french cheese. 2) the dishes are ok but nothing to wow. We had been to Michelin starred restaurants in U.K. and France which offered much interesting flavourful dishes. And the portion size was too small for a 4 course menu. I am again comparing this with starred restaurants in Paris. In summary, I rated this place average.
5
We were scheduled for a movie at the Lido Shaw theatre and decided for a special early dinner at Les Amis. We were not disappointed. This is our first visit to Les Amis and on every score from ambience, to service to outstanding food- the dinner was one of the best I've had in Singapore or almost anywhere for that matter. Portions are small and there are many of them each coming in a well timed sequence. Each and everyone was unusual and tantalized our taste buds. It was a set menu on the pricey side but well worth it. The wine was chosen by the Sommelier and a good choice indeed. It was a Chateauneuf du Pape on the low end of the prices here but very good. Altogether a great experience. Our only regret that we underestimated a bit the time for the full course meal so we were a bit rushed at the end to make the show -our mistake. The meal deserves a three hour time slot to fully enjoy. We'll be back
3
This has always been a Favourite of mine for French food in Singapore with innovative dishes that were quite consistent over time. The service was always attentive, without being intrusive. Since its recent renovation, however, I've found the food (perhaps because of the new menus) to be somewhat ordinary. There appears to be more choice in the sets, but most dishes are pretty standard fare. The quality has slipped too, even as prices are higher. The service remains impeccable though.
3
There's so much good reviews which had draw me to dine at Les Amis. My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday at Les Amis on 01 Oct 2016 (Saturday) during lunch. We ordered the 3 course+1dessert menu each @ $90++. These were what we've ordered:Cold appetizer: Salmon TartareCold appetizer: Crab FrivoliteHot appetizer: Foie Gras & EelHot appetizer: Hokkaido ScallopsMain: Pigeon Au SangMain: Dry Aged Irish BeefDesserts: Williams PearDesserts: Dark Chocolate MexiqueI wouldn't say the food weren't nice but I personally felt that it was pretty average & guess I would have to say it definitely isn't the best. The desserts however were really good & I love both of those we've ordered. As it was my birthday, Les Amis had prepared a complimentary chocolate cake and it tasted really good too. I sincerely wanna thank Les Amis. The service at Les Amis was outstanding. Staffs were attentive, polite and very welcoming. Altho the food weren't as outstanding as the service was. Nevertheless, the experience was great and we were contented with an opportunity to dine there
5
We had the six course menu offered by Les Amis. One guest had a few dietary restrictions which were handled kindly as though it was no problem at all. Once the hot brioche and hand churned French butter came to the table we all knew we were in for a great meal. Each course was better than the next - perfectly proportioned and beautifully presented. We all loved our meal. Another bonus, we went on a Sunday night. Many of Singapore's finer dining spots are closed on Sunday. Les Amis isn't and we were glad that our one night reunion could be celebrated with such a lovely meal. The restaurant itself is rather "vanilla" - nothing really stood out with regard to the ambience or decor The service was spectacular though. I would definitely recommend Les Amis and plan to return.
4
Most fortunate to have a chance to taste the food at a 2 Michelin Star restaurant.So, is it excellent? Have to say yes. Whats unique about it? The butter. Out of this world. The Al Dente cooking of all the dishes. Just right. In my humble opinion the balance is a wee bit off. Memory? The pineapple desert, a tiny square piece of pineapple atop a pastry and when you bite into it, pineapple juice oozes out like in Xiao Long Bao Mmmm....... Of course I love pineapple
4
Les Amis offers 3 dinner sets - Classic ($168++), Signature ($240++) & Tasting ($298++). Difference between the Classic and Signature are that they offer different main course and Signature set comes with foie gras. The ambience is poise and classy, with crystal chandeliers and soothing songs played. Even the air conditioning is set to perfect temperature. I love the lobster wrapped with baby spinach (a small round green ball) & the salmon cooked in 2 ways. The lamb chop (main course) tastes ordinary. Every portion of the courses is pretty small but with 7 courses and the bread/loaf, you will be full. Food presentation and services are top class. Be prepared to foot more than $1300+ for a table of 4
5
Les Amis is without doubt one of the finest French restaurants in Singapore, if not the world. Lunch is a great introduction to the refined & assured cooking of Chef Sebastien Lepinoy. The dining room crew are no slouch either and from beginning to end, my experience had been a superlative one. The Michelin inspectors have been correct in awarding this jewel two of their much coveted stars. I ate weekday lunch here & opted for the chef's menu with a few substitutions. It well priced at SGD 155, considering the refined cooking & quality of the ingredients used. Or you could opt for a 4 course menu at SGD 90. Standouts are lobster turban spaghetti with black truffle, the cold angel hair pasta with caviar and kombu, the excellent tomato tart on a confit of young onions. I had an exceptional main of sole meuniÃ¨re with gorillas which was very fresh, and deftly prepared. There are a lot of memories and I'd most certainly return. Bravo to the entire team. The I'm

It was one of the oldest French fine dining restaurant situated at the centre of Singapore, Scott road. The ambience is nice but don't expect MBS scenery . The food was fresh and tasty, we were served with 6 course dinner which I think is good enough. Fore gras , cold pasta with truffle oil and lamb rack were beautifully prepared. The special dessert made also surprised and impressive. Plentiful choices of wine to chose from with reasonable price . Well deserved Michelin 2 stars! The waiters were attentive and friendly .
5
Was here for my birthday and couldn't have asked for a better dinner. It's French fine dining of the highest quality. I have no complaints at all about the food nor the service. Of course, it would have been better if it came with a fantastic view like atop Marina Bay Sands.I can dream, can I not ?Well done and I shall be back for sure
5
Les Amis could be one of the oldest fine dining restaurant in Singapore that's still standing strong.Just recently crowned with 2 Michelin Star I think it's well deserves it.Location is a little weird compare to other fine restaurant in Singapore where most have great view or prestige location. Les Amis is located in the heart of Orchard Road besides other Bistros. But the decor is new and classy. They have done best with the limited floor space they have. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu. Portion is appropriate and the food are using the fresh season produce flown from France.Star of the day was probably the first course Angel Hair pasta with Kombu(japanese kelp), Caviar and Black Truffles. Probably it goes best with our bottle of Italian wine. We just love how fresh the ingredients are and how well the chef puts it together to create another dimension of flavours.Great Service - Staffs are well-trained and friendly. That kind of service that you would expect from the restaurant like this.Wine list is impressive consist of 75 Pages of well-selected wine from sommelier. Ranging from $80 per bottles to 5 digits price point per bottle! (holy) If you don't need a bottle of DRC everyday wine by the glass probably is value for money. A glass of Chablis Grand Cru 2010 for $27++. Overall, we love the service love the food. It's still a humble restaurant I can imagine why they don't bother to move to other "fancier" location as the patrons always come back. Lunch 6 course : Tasting menu $155++Total spending for 2 person with a bottle of wine = S$540 (include tax and service charge

We visited Les Amis to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary on 31st July. The meal was absolutely fantastic, we had the classic menu which included amuse bouche breaks. We were looked after by Raymond Ho and his team, who could not be more attentive. We were lucky to be there the day after they had received their second Michelin star, which from our experience was well deserved. In addition they made us an anniversary cake as a further celebration, which we took away as we were full and replete! We would recommend anyone wanting to give themselves a fine dining treat, and was by far the best meal we had in Singapore. They also open on Sunday which is rare in Singapore for some reason. many congratulations on a fine dining experience
5
Dined at this place a day after the restaurant received it's well-deserved 2 Michelin star recognition. The ambience is good and we dined in a private room. The service is impeccable and the meal is exquisite and well presented by the executive chef Sebastien Lepinoy. Not a restaurant to miss If you want a memorable, fine-dining experience.

It so happened our visit for lunch on a Sunday (not common to find a fine dining restaurant open on a Sunday!!), coincided with the recent award of 2 Michelin Stars to Les Amis. Naturally that would have increased our expectations and it was such a pleasant lunch, we were not disappointed. The service was good and attentive. The portions of food was appropriate thereby allowing full enjoyment of the tasting menu of 6 courses. The amuse bouche was excellent, as was the bread basket of a variety of breads (small sized) and at the end of the meal (I shall not spoil the surprise) there is a nice touch! The signature dishes of the tasting menu were excellent and if you wish to have 4 courses - go for the ala carte where there is a varied enough selection. We went for a mix, ala carte and tasting menu. The dover sole - go for it, if it is on the menu (in season) - it was wonderful. The waiter noted it was a tad undercooked whilst serving it, and immediately took it back for "rectification". The adour salmon was also cooked just enough and was tender. The touch of wasabi in the tartare version was interesting and mild, giving a twist to the traditional tartare.My partner who normally has "something" that starts with a but - for once felt everything was just right. So this is a place we will return to. Just for information, they also have a lunch express menu on workdaysWhilst on Sunday, the place was not full, reservations would be recommended so as not to be disappointed.The restaurant is easy to get on public transport, close to the Orchard MRT, or by taxi, and whilst in the middle of the shopping district, is tucked just a little way out of the main stream traffic in Shaw Centre
5
Went today for lunch and it was .by far the best meal we have had in Singapore. The service was perfect, the selection varied, and every dish came out hot a beautiful. The Dover sole was fantastic and the desserts...cannot be missed. It was a real treat and we plan to return on our next visit
4
Good food ... Good ambience.... Good service... Recommended if you are around here for a good lunch or dinner...
Came here a few times and they are able to maintain their standards.
5
Was a great birthday as the beauty and taste of the lunch course laid before us was simply perfect! The angelhair pasta left us craving for Les Amis again and again! ❤️
5
We were there for business lunch after the conference and place was really suitable for this. Quiet, great wine selection and amazing express lunch. Staff was very friendly and make our lunch journey full of excitements.
5
If you intend ti have a high class diner with Asian smelt you are on right place. Different variety of Manu to be chosen and amazing vine selection world wide.

Best French in Singapore.First Class Food: there was a choice of three degustation menus, we had the 8-course (see my pic). My favourites were the cold angel hair pasta with truffle and caviar; the langoustine raviolo; tomato tartine (presentation was amazing, red flower on a plate); peach air blown pearl dessert. Oops, that's just about everything!First Class Service: Knowledgable, professional, accommodating, welcoming. The sommelier was exceptional.First Class Prices: Yes, it's expensive. But for us, a special occasion, well worth it. Degustation menus ranged $185-$295 per person plus 10% service and 7% tax. Wine pairing $120-$185. Don't think about it, just hand over the card and be done with it

A friend and I decided to go to Les Amis to try out the four course lunch and it was truly excellent. We loved the seasonal choices and between the two of us had the crab, baby leeks, pea soup and sole. All the dishes were very tasty. The crab starter was one of the prettiest presentations I have ever seen. Excellent value, very good staff. Highly recommend a visit.
5
In every way, a Michelin star experience. Excellent food and service and a brilliant wine list. We had the tasting menu and I must say every single thing was curated to perfection. The lobster ravioli was the star of the show. For dessert, the chocolate milifi was unbelievably good. They are soon getting rated for Michelin and I'm sure they will get it, deservedly.

This is it. Indulge yourself. Les Amis is the type of place to go to celebrate a birthday or anniversary, but when my partner suggested we go out to a casual Saturday night dinner, boy, did I come underdressed and the experience was far from casual. As soon as I walked through the door and was greeted by the maÃ®tre d', I was cursing wearing my denim skirt and beat up New Look pumps. Should of busted out the stiletto Louboutin's for this particular evening! Despite this, the place did not give an air of arrogance one bit. The staff were incredibly well trained and it came of second nature to them to be so personable with guest and basically know their stuff.The food was beautifully presented and I was in awe at every dish that appeared our table--perfect in every way possible. Butter that is only served in 20 restaurants in the world? Yes please! Was it worth it? Heck yes!I do not recall the last time my restaurant experience left me smiling from ear-to-ear. I was just so happy that my smile stayed glued on my face the entire evening. That dent in your wallet will incredibly be every penny worth spent for this gastronomic experience.Do yourself a favor and go for a life changing experience. I look forward to also experiencing the other restaurants this group has to offer that monopolizes the entire block. Thank Les Amis for turning our casual Saturday dinner to a night never to be forgotten

On a business trip in Singapore, I decided to splurge for dinner out one night. I selected Les Amis because it is on a list of top 50 restaurants in Asia, which I have found to be helpful in the past. I booked through Amex Platinum concierge. The experience was perfect from start to finish. This restaurant deserves a rave review. In my experience, restaurants often give solo diners the short end of the stick for seating. I was seated at a two-top positioned so that I could see most of the dining room but not feel like I was sitting out in the open. It was a great seat for one. The menu offered three tasting options; 5-course, 6-course, or 8-course. Each option had one choice for the main entree. I went with the 8-course, which was priced at S$295. I also requested the wine pairing, which although not advertised, was S$160. The wine line is impressive, but I prefer the variety of good pairings. The dining experience started with a gift from the chef (3 items, 2 of each, plus 2 small rolls). I also selected a glass of rose champagne. After the taste, the pour was short, but that was remedied without me asking. From there, the dinner progressed through multiple courses per the menu. Each course was divine. The staff were very conscientious about making sure the tempo met my expectations, and eventually settled into a good rhythm. Dinner took about 4 hours. Each course was accompanied by a wine pairing that appeared to have been more than just pairings from the "by-the-bottle" list. The somm poured each selection and provided a good explanation of the producer and tasting notes. The selections were varied, a good balance of reds and whites, and offered good value including a 1993 french red and a 1966 Madeira with the foie gras. The portions was appropriate to ensure good value but not overindulgence (albeit as an 8 course dinner with wine pairings is in itself an indulgence). The presentation of courses was very well done with each course presented in the perfect dishware, with the appropriate utensils; each glass of wine was served in the right glass for that varietal/type. And, the staff were knowledgeable about the dishware, explaining unique characteristics of certain pieces and of course provided an appropriate description of the dish, without mumbling or being rushed. These are the kinds of details that round out a true fine dining experience. The meal ended with coffee (I declined, then was offered decaf and accepted), two dessert courses, and mignardises. The check was presented and efficiently handled. Of note, the staff went above and beyond to help me get home; suggesting an alternate route back to my hotel with some interesting sightseeing for the walk. Les Amis was really spectacular. I would recommend it without hesitation for a milestone celebration, a romantic dinner for two, or even a splurge for one

Wonderful food and great service from Raymond! The four course set lunch was delightful. I especially love the freshly baked bread. The food standard is high. Everything offered on the menu is good. Have been here for lunch quite a few times already. Dinner is on the high side
3
The food served here was a classical French cuisine with modern plating. The appetizer was plated beautifully. The main course was a bit regular. The dessert was awesome. I don't think I would come again given the recent experience and the cost of the bill.
5
Having tried many restaurants around Singapore in all ranges,Les Amis still tops as one the best restaurants for service as well as the food being very comforting,not too complicated but well executed to the best. All the dishes i had were very seasonal inspired and also tasty especially the Sweetbreads which is one of my favorite but yet uncommon to find in Singapore. the desserts were outstanding especially the Hazelnut Souffle where you can find hazelnuts at the bottom for textur
5
Came here for business lunch and ordered lunch set. I was impressed with the quality of the ingredients, refined taste and presentation of the dishes. Service was also excellent, every dish was explained to us for better appreciation. The starter was interesting and delicate, i then had the scallops, lobster roulette, pork loin amd mika orange. All were prepared intricately. The portion was just nice for me and of cause there was the petit fours and nice coffee. Will definitely come back again.
4
I left Les Amis with a slight feeling of disappointment. Every dish was very well prepared but there was a lack of contrasting tastes and colours between dishes so that the overall effect was somewhat uniform. In that respect the food corresponds to the dining room, where the lighting and colours are low in contrast. Comfortable it is: cosy, less so.A visual highlight was an amuse bouche of delicate smoked fish topped with caviar, laid on a bed of sauce mousseline or similar upon which miniature decorations had been exquisitely arranged. A taste highlight was the bread - home made, in three varieties - and delicious hand-crafted butter from special cows giving a rich buttery flavour. Regarding food value, our meal contained a high proportion of protein and fat, so the overall effect is quite rich. Fish is cooked with careful temperature control so that it remains soft and the moisture is retained. We enjoyed the freshness and the careful preparation.There are about four reds, four whites and several sparkling wines, including four champagnes (an opportunity to taste Dom Perignon) by the glass. The sommelier is knowledgeable and you may try the still wines before choosing.Service was efficient and friendly.Overall a very pleasant meal but at that the price we will probably not return
5
Having eaten worldwide in many all quality range restaurants and always critical about paying top dollar, restaurant Les Amis thoroughly surprised and impressed me. All was excellent: food, service, wine, ambiance, bread, amuses, etc. Excellent place for business dinners and special private occasions. My new reference for such appointments in the Orchard Road, Scotts Road area. Easy to get near the place, but difficult to actually find the restaurant. Opposite the Grand Hyatt (take Scotts Road overpass or walk towards Orchard Road, taking the Tang - Shaw Centre underpass). It is in the back street behind Shaw Centre / Orchard Road, to the left from Scotts Road, so do not enter Shaw Centre itself. At the end of a row of other nice restaurants at street level, opposite the HSBC branch
5
We visited here for dinner, on the recommendation of a friend, and found the food to be very well prepared and presented. Some of the tastes were unusual, but were excellent, without exception. We ate from the Signature menu, and enjoyed it greatly. Service was really good too, and even although the restaurant was full, there was enough space between the tables to give privacy. It is quite expensive, but OK for a fine dining experience
4
We had a business lunch at Les Amis, we all went for the 3+1 lunch menu which is a good value: dishes are good with lots of flavor. Service is good, could be improved if the staff knew a bit better the details of each dish. I recommend the artichoke salad as a cold starter, and definitely the hazelnut soufflé for dessert. We were disappointed to see the Chef greeting other tables, but not ours
3
Probably the best part of the set menu (S$90) was the dessert. My wife got the better choices, starting with artichoke (cold appetizer), foie grass/eel (hot appetizer), veal loin (main), and hazelnut soufflé with dark chocolate sorbet. Be warned, the portions are frenchy small. Great bread choices could sate some appetites. Forget the dry aged Irish beef or the cold foie gras terrine. Other standouts reported by the group included Hokkaido scallop (singular), and sea bass
5
I came here for lunch with two other friends on a Sunday. The staff was really professional and attentive and showed us to our table right away and made us comfortable for our meal. On Sundays they had a set lunch of 3 courses and 1 dessert for 90SGD. Definitely very reasonably priced!I ordered their signature angel hair with caviar which was one of the best angel hair pastas I have ever had. The texture was so springy and al dente that is it almost unbelieveable that they can make it so perfect for such a petit portion. For mains I ordered the pork loin and the strawberry sphere for dessert - both of them were marvelously executed!My friends had their salmon tartar with caviar which was also another amazing starter and the lobster salad was equally a good pick too! The service was excellent and truly professional. It was a really enjoyable lunch with extremely good value for money,Love to come here again

Les Amis, helmed by Chef de cuisine Sebastien Lepinoy, is ranked 12th in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2016. Opened since 1994, they are one of the longest standing fine-dining restaurants in Singapore. During my week-long trip to Singapore in January, I managed to secure a lunch reservation at their establishment. Les Amis offers several dining options with seasonally crafted menus which ranges from 65$+ to $295+. We opted for ‘Le Menu Tasting’ which showcases 6 dishes for $155 per person. It’s comprised of one cold appetizer, two hot appetizers, two main courses and one dessert. One of the hidden gems found here is their rare artisanal french Le Ponclet Butter – only served in less than 20 restaurants in the world. The butter is made with milk from a near extinct breed of cows and undergoes an intricate handmade process in order to obtain the most amazing texture and flavour. The highlight was their angel hair pasta signature dish. This was the main reason for our visit to Les Amis and is probably the highlight for most guests. The angel hair pasta is wrapped around delicately with a balance combination of kombu stock – the king of seaweed. Topped with a generous portion of caviar, two slices of black truffle, edible gold and edible flowers, this is probably the most exquisite combination of ingredients you can ever find in one dish. Dining at Les Amis was a lovely experience. It’s clear that the whole team take a lot of pride in their work and I commend them for it. If you’re looking for a straightforward contemporary French fine dining experience with a high level of finesse, Les Amis is the place to be

Must do for those who love European cuisine with an Asian touch. Great place for business meetings: separate rooms for small groups and a visit to the (small) wine cellar is a nice bonus, even for spoilt C-levels.
5
We have been coming to Les Amis for more than 10 years, and after a break we decided to treat ourselves. As one of the few restaurants in Singapore, the Les Amis group is able to retain their good staff, which is also reflected in their excellent service. We had the 8 course Les Amis menu, which was really enjoyable. Our favourites were: Caviar Kristal, Comte Cheese Souffle, Blue Lobster, the French Sea Bass and the Japanese Tenderloin. Good portion sizes, just right. The sommerlier did a good job and the wine degustation consisting of 8 memorable wines, much better that in similar fine restaurants in Singapore that often serve obscure butique wines. Highly Recommended

A top tier French restaurant in Singapore!Service is flawless. They attend to every detail and even beyond your intention. Food is also among the top level in Singapore French restaurants. Dishes are creative and nicely cooked, able to impress you. Display is well designed as well. From the photo of other reviewers, I can tell they make new changes/creations from time to time, which I should really give credit to - especially for a restaurant with 20 years operation. Only pity is I did not have a chance to speak to the chef, hopefully next time can make it. Thanks to the whole team! Will definitely come back.

We were curious to try Les Amis, part of the furniture of fine dining restaurants in Asia. It's very traditional in decor, atmosphere and service - well suited to business lunches and dinners. Service was excellent, sommelier helpful. We had the signature tasting menu with an excellent Bordeaux. Food was very good and authentically French, but if it had not been for the bread, I think we would have left hungry - not something we expected for the price! There are better value fine dining tasting menus out there - and for that reason I nearly rated it average as I didn't think it was stand out for the money. That said, we are glad we tried it.
5
Les Amis is an old fancy french Singapore. The restaurant is located at Shaw House on the Orchard Road. The food here is just awesome. The dessert is quite good as well. I have tried all the notable restaurants in Singapore and in my book it is the best in terms of food quality and value for money
5
French gourmet at its best. We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday. My second time to Les Amis and my wife's first.We went for the tasting menu which had the most extensive line-up. The plating of each dish was impeccable and classy. So much detail could be seen in the presentation. The dishes looked so beautiful and we marvelled at them before eating. And the taste was amazing and sophisticated.The restaurant prepared a complimentary birthday cake for my wife. We were also given cookies in silver tins at the end of the meal. Such thoughtfulness from the crew at Les Amis.It is no wonder why Les Amis earned 12th place in Asia's 50 best restaurants 2016. We will not be surprised when Michelin stars are awarded to this restaurant this year. Bon appetit

The fine French food at Les Amis, fits the bill

Les Amis has been in the fine dining scene for a full 20 years and has always been a place for good food,good wines and good service. been here on countless occasions for both lunch and dinner, it has always been consistent regardless of which chefs is at the helm.My lunch this time was as good as i been following Chef Sebastien since his Cepage days in hong kong. They currently offer a 4 course tasting menu for $80 with a minimum of 10 appetisers and 10 main courses for choice and desserts which for a fine dining restaurant is rare in singapore and even harder to maintain the standardsI started off with a choice of the hot and cold appetisers of the signature angel hair pasta and the lobster rouelle wrapped in spinach. it was both a delight to see and to taste as the portions were sufficient and generous.Followed by a main course of Pan Seared John Dory which was perfectly executed with the fish not being overcooked especially for a delicate fish, it just melts in your mouth the moment you taste it. equally good is also the other ingredients that came with it, as its not too complicated with too many ingredients but simple and tastylastly the dessert of Candied Mikan was very refreshing when it came to the table, the mikan is a seasonal fruit and thus very delicate, a good way to end the lunch. Definitely coming back again soon to taste the Les Amis team dishes!

I had dinner with my husband and it was fantastic birthday in February 2016. Food was absolutely incredible French Black Truffle menu , Black Truffle from Provence and best quality ever i had. And for me, it is best taste and flavor better than any other white truffle from Alba. We order 2 different menu (Menu Classic and Menu Tasting ) and kindly they accept us , because usually most of fine dinning never accept it. I really love Chef. Sebastien's signature dishes of 'Potato Salad' ,'black truffle tart' , and 'wild Venison' was fantastic!!!I had a lot of caviar and truffle first class of quality as well great value for the money. They have own their selection of Caviar 'Les Amis'. For sure, next time we will try it!And exclusive the butter which is Le Ponclet only Les Amis has it in Asia. All ingredients are perfect! Service is impeccable as well. Warn, kind, friendly really take caring!!! Wine selection was incredible!And when we had dessert they served birthday chocolate cake was superb and Chef. Sebastien came to us kindly celebrate to us and gave Silver box it was a beautiful almond Cake.Best meal of my life.I can say best real french restaurant in Singapore!!!Strongly recommend

Been there for the first time but was unfortunately not impressed. Don't get me wrong the service is good so is the food but this is it, it is just good. First, the restaurant itself, nothing much in terms of decoration, view or "wow" effect. The room temperature is absolutely freezing, as it is usually in Singapore but we found this one particularly cold. The service is good nothing to say about it. The sommelier was pretty friendly, the wine we wanted was not available so he recommended a good alternative. Now the food, we chose 2 different menus to be able to try and share some dishes. Most of it was pretty well prepared with good cooking techniques. Lots of dishes were containing black truffle, we love black truffle. It was tasteless. Black Truffle, tasteless, it is not a right combination as we all know how strong truffle mushroom is supposed to be. At first we thought maybe the method of cooking was taking away the flavor, but more dishes were coming and the black truffle was still flavorless. At the end of the dinner the Chef comes to the tables to meet and greet, collect some feedbacks and offers a little souvenir, which is really lovely, but when we raised the black truffle issue, it didn't bother him much and couldn't come up with a proper explanation. I usually don't right average comment on Trip Advisor as I prefer to raised the issue straight to the management as a constructive feedback for immediate action, but this time I feel it is fair to write these comments as it might help customers to select another dinning destination with better quality / value for money and avoid wasting time if you are food lovers visiting Singapore on a short visit
5
Sublime. That's the word to describe the meal. From appetizers to mains to desserts, each dish is thoughtfully planned, skilfully prepared and beautifully presented. I can't wait to return. Service was excellent too.
2
Great service, normal flavour, exotic author food, too expensive and very small portions. I do not recommend it.... :/
5
I've patronized Les Amis for years now. The food is consistently outstanding, and the service among the best in Singapore. I'm certain that it'll get at least a star in the upcoming Michelin Guide, very probably two. I highly encourage visiting. With that said, it features consistently good dishes rather than a small number of truly excellent ones, and there isn't, say, the spark of creativity found in some places. Still, it easily deserves a good rating - but to use the Michelin's descriptions once again, it's more "excellent cooking" than "worth a special journey"
5
Les Amis, is offering 3 set menus in different price range and if you want with wine pairing, otherwise chose your wine from the stunning wine menu, anything you look for you will find on this unbelievable wine list.The food quality, presentation and test was perfect and in Europe they would have a Michelin Star. Service was very friendly and attentive , very good in all aspects and the Asian lady, unfortunately I did not catch her name, took very well care of us. So you defiantly have to try this one out
4
We came as a family with under 7 yrs old kids and everything was great, food, wine & service.Only thing was my husband's meat was tough and they made a new plate for him otherwise we are happy with the restaurant.We took both classic and signature sets while the rest of the family did Ala Carte.Worth it ,especially the wild venison & lobster bisque
5
I have dined at Les Amis thrice over the past 4 months i.e., in August to celebrate my birthday, in November with my team/colleagues of 15 people, and in December with a senior colleague. The entire service team (including Alex), Executive Chef Sebastien and Pastry Chef CheryI truly should be complimented for consistently delivering excellent service and food, making my entire dining experiences there a memorable one. For example, the service team acceded to my (as well as my guests) requests for some changes and additions to be made to the set menus and went an extra mile to print out individual menus for us on all the three aforementioned occasions. They explained each course with earnestness and enthusiasm, and attended to our questions with patience. The service team was always attentive and polite. The food prepared by the chefs demonstrated great finesse, in particular the caviar kristal angel hair pasta, foie gras & eel, lobster rouelle as well as the mikan desert. I am already looking forward to dining there again, especially its next seasonal menu
3
We read about the Les Amis revamp earlier in the year and decided to visit at the last minute on a weekday evening. We got a nice table by the window. Service was good - the wait staff were efficient and look to have had the benefit of the right training. The new dining room was light and airy.Now the food - it was competently prepared but not terribly memorable. The wine list is comprehensive but expensive.If you must have a French meal in Singapore, Les Amis will no doubt be recommended to you. We imagine it must be popular with diners with an expense account. The restaurant aims high and should be commended for its ambitions. Just remember for the price of the meal, you will likely have an exceptional dinner in Paris or Tokyo. But Les Amis isn't quite there yet
5
Les Amis has been a dream dinner place that I have always wanted to go like forever. It is THE place that we used to boast of going when I first started working that we will go when we became rich. Just like compass rose when I was just schooling. Anyway I had my anniversary dinner there earlier this year and the food was just amazing. I especially love the butter ( can't stop eating it) and the cold angel hair pasta infused with truffle and topped with cavier. I love this sea salt flower that seems to appear in every dish. Still do not know where I can get it. The service was excellent with the waiter explaining each and every dish serve including how special the butter was. Overall the dinner was perfect as expected. Definitely a must go back place for special occasions.
5
Been here many times for lunch and seldom here for dinner. Decided to come here for a bday dinner Drove and got the valet to park the car, that was convenient . Upon entering, I could feel the attention paid to service There are 3 dinner menus - 6, 7 and 8 courses. We decided on the 7. There was bread and brioche, both very good. There was amuse bouche , and it was good. We ordered a bottle and the sommelier apologetically said it was not available. He offered a more expensive bottle at the same price. Very nice of themThe 1st course started with a bang - salmon with caviar and it was very good. There were a couple of misses like the oyster mousse and artichoke, but there were hits too - Japanese Omi beefsteak and golden ball dessert were outstanding They had a nice chocolate cake for the bday boy as well, again another nice touch Petit fours ended the wonderful evening. Certainly will be back
5
I ordered the tasting menu for lunch and was expecting shaved white truffles on the Angel hair caviar pasta. When it was served without, I was disappointed but the chef compensated with a white truffle tart. Naturally I was pleasantly surprised. Thank you for listening to your customer feedback and for the wonderful service.
5
Good modern french restaurant. Extensive wine list and experienced sommalier who would recommend what wine to go with the food. Pricey but worthy.
5
This is THE restaurant to indulge in for extraordinary tasting foie gras, divinely flavourful French Onion Soup, and succulent charcoal grilled meats.
5
These restaurant not only has one of the best chef in Singapore but a great pastry chef as well.
Cheryl Koh hits all the sweet spots and makes a winning combination with Sebastien Lepinoy.
Get ready to be bowled over!
5
Chic and luxury french cuisine in Singapore. The atmosphere is really relaxed and the stuff is amazingly polite.
5
We had about seven courses and each plate was delicious. The fois gras was particularly good and service was excellent!

Could easily get 1 or 2 Michelin stars: we have been to Les Amis restaurant 7 or 8 times, lunch and dinner. It was always perfect, extremely refined in taste , presentation and service. Food is French traditional with subtile Asian touches. Ingredients are of supreme quality. And the home made basket of many different bread is irresistible. Even the butter is a delicacy there, from a Butter Master in Normandy. And you can feel it is special. A special mention to the sommelier, as he seems to be the best and most passionate in town, out of the "serious" fine dining tables in Singapore; we tried them all. The wine list is impressive, not cheap, but extremely rich, varied and balanced.The staff is high class trained, caring, discreet and so efficient as well as accommodating. Everyone feels special in Les Amis, a notion of service rarely seen and felt in Singapore, even in supposedly high end places.The lunch menu at S$80 is highly recommendable: 4 courses, to choose on a generous a la carte menu, including amuse-bouche and mignardises, and coffee/tea. Plus they offer a selection of excellent 1/2 bottles of white and red wine, that go perfectly well with this menu.The dinner gourmet menus are fabulous. Pricey, but it is worth the quality, the service, and the pleasure. It is original, refined, perfectly presented and justâ€¦ succulent!The wine pairing is highly recommended. They manage observe a variety of excellent wines across the board.I think it is the only place we would go as often as possible, knowing that it is always excellent and perfect. The menus are all changed at least 4 times a year, with the seasonal ingredients from Europe and America.one minor regret: the decorum is a bit too classic and boring. Classy, but impersonal..

We made a last minute reservation on a Friday night and luckily a table was available. The ambience of the restaurant is simple but classy. Once we arrived, the doorman was quick to open the door and show us to our table. There is a choice of 3 menus, each with different price tags. We went for the classic one which is the cheapest and offers 5 dishes + desert. There's also an extensive wine list with a wide selection of wines at different prices.From the classic menu, the entree of caviar and salmon was not perhaps the best starter to start the evening. The scallop and the poached Atlantic cod are much better options on the menu, especially the latter which was the best dish. The scampi tart and veal loin were average and although good did not have the wow factor. The apple tart (of course with a proper French name) was a delightful end to the evening accompanied with coffee.The service is very good with very attentive and informed servers. Food is served at appropriate times, not too slow and not too fast. Good timing to enjoy the evening and digest the food :

Had a business dinner here this week. Venue was chosen by the host after receiving recommendations. I thought the atmosphere was minimalist and quite bland. The food was reasonable but not up to the standard I had expected. The set menu we all selected (6 dishes) was more "French" influenced than truly French
5
Express lunch offer still provide a good quality three-course meal with coffee / tea. SGD 55 per per person, with excellent service and high quality food. Dessert was especially nice. Onion soup also very french taste with nice presentation. Location is excellent and you can just grab a taxi within 1 minutes down the road if you are in a hurry.
5
Les Amis has been one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore for many years.We started dinner with cold angel hair pasta with black truffle and caviar. Sweetness from the caviar combined with the fragrance of truffle and the slightly sour cold pasta really cranked up our appetite without filling our stomachs.Unlike "lesser" restaurants who serve veal but serve beef, this was a genuinely succulent veal, in a generous cut with 3 ribs. Garnished with chanterelle mushrooms and asparagus this is a amazing dish! Hopefully this will still be on their menu on my next trip!Their wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. Staff is friendly and professional
5
We had an awesome lunch at Les Amis. Everything was prepared in perfection with the best ingredients. The cold pasta and caviar opens our lunch and the Langouse and Ohmi beef are simply superb...looking forward to go back to Les Amis...
5
Went there for lunch and ordered the tasting menu. Highly recommended. All dishes in the menu were nicely cooked and prepared, from starter all the way to dessert. Particularly like the angel hair and the beef.The service is attentive and prompt, as expected for such a fine dining restaurant.While Les Amis' food may not as creative as Andre's, the food was perfectly prepared and tasted very delicious
5
It was my first visit to Les Amis. Service was impeccable and friendly. W chose the signature menu out of the three menus presented. My standout dish for the night was the "oven roasted challon duck with tellicherry pepper and sauce poivrade". It was simple traditional french food but well executed. The chef even came out to say hello, which was really appreciating. A splendid evening at Les Amis, will definitely visit again
3
as a European, you don't have to go all the way to Singapore to find food like this. The cuisine is competent rather than exciting and one of the fish dishes featured the smallest piece of fish ever seen.By contrast, the service was exceptional and went out of its way to ensure my wife's various special requirements (vegetarian, white flour allergy) were more than fully met.A 2008 Chablis premier cru (at S$140 the bottle) was, however, over-acidic and brought the whole menu up during the night. Viator Colonia
3
I went to Les Amis less than a month ago and I can only recall one dish from the "cheapest" classic menu (at S$170 per person) and that was a slightly burnt tasting chocolate millefueille, which was different and worked well for my colleagues who don't like over sweet deserts. I vaguely recall nicely presented carpaccio of something, probably with a little caviar, and competently cooked beef. Service was excellent, the whole evening for six of us was enjoyable, but for the top prices here the lack of wow factor was a disappointment
5
Les Amis offers a quiet classic atmosphere within the agitated heart of Singapore.Tables are far enough from each other proving a nice feel of comfort and privacy.Their highest mark is an outstanding and timely service.You feel taken care of since the moment you arrived in a way which is pleasant without getting overwhelming.We picked their lighter ( and least expensive) menu featuring mostly seafood served in the right proportions.Not too big,not too small,so that in the end we were able to leave without feeling too guilty.Along the way they gave us few minutes between the seven servings in the menu so that you could have a very nice meal in less than two hours.Not bad when fighting jet lag after a long day of activities.Food is really very good but missing a little bit of cream and stronger spices on the background French style ,but really enjoyable and tasty overall.Their wine list is limited but good enough to find some adequate option for your meal.I appreciated the fact that their wine prices were acceptable compared to other local restaurant that abuse to the point where you end up with a Diet Coke instead. :) .Worth trying for a couple of hours of quietness and enjoyment

Last month I visited the Les Amis during vacation. I made a reservation for lunch course one week prior to departure. They have a wonderful atmosphere and tastes very good, specially for wagyu steak. Also there are good wine lists and fantastic staff. The price is relatively high, but I recommend it's a suitable place for special day. Lunch course would be wonderful alternative, if you hesitate due to price

Service was very very attentive. Everyone was very friendly and explains the food very patiently, smiles are seen throughout the meal indeed.About the food, Ingredients definitely shines as the flavors were subtle and the components supports all the main ingredients. Bread & butter service is impeccable, Angel hair is definitely heavenly. But i have to agree with other recent reviewers presentation is not that unique. All in all a great restaurant, will go back the next time aroun

Les Amis sets such high expectations from the all A list restaurants or the price they charge but unfortunately the experience is a little bit disappointing.Do not take me wrong, the food is good when it comes to the technic or the quality of the ingredients and the service is excellent - as a basic in such high class dining place.However, I found the menu a bit "boring", lacking of imagination and "wow" effect; therefore the bill is quite difficult to digest at the end of the meal...

This is an expensive and well regarded restaurant. It was very good. That is it. It wasn't great, it wasn't mind blowing, it was very good. I had a far superior dining experience in Bangkok days later.The pros were a positive friendly and knowledgable waiter, quality starters, bread and butter.The negative was an unimaginative ability to deal with my wife's requirement for gluten fee food. The desert dish they came up with was a plain plate of fruit even though they had sorbets, sauces and more available. I'm happy we are their but wouldn't go back at the price
5
Quiet place with privacy. Happy face staffs. Great wine recommendations. Food is perfect in quality & quantity.
PS Thx they keep good care of my iPhone (I nearly lost my precious)

Since many Food Critics cover Les Amis (I got mine from TimeOut), I will provide a more pedestrian "man on the street" view! Les Amis is expensive but with judicious selection (we didn't!), you can keep costs under control. I was very impressed that their very scarily extensive wine list also included a selection of "good value" wines which says to me, Les Amis doesn't intimidate you to empty your wallet. We were offered a choice of three degustation menus (5 to 10 courses) which ranged in price from $170 to $280. I'm not big on sea food which Les Amis is, so I found myself "battling through" the meal at times. However, judging by the oo's and the ah's from my dining partners, the sea food was excellent. As was the service--impeccable. We had 4 waiters taking care of us with that excellent French knack of being on hand when you need them but not in your face when you don't. I believe the interior has been done up recently and it was very nice -- modern but not sparse or stuffy. I would recommend Les Amis for very special occasions
3
Found this to be overpriced for what they provide. Seems like a pattern with the Les Amis group of restaurants in Singapore. Food is average and then they charge an arm and a leg for them. Specifically for this Les Amis restaurant, they were not able accommodate properly people with gluten and dairy intolerance. They just gave me fruit and salad in place of the original dishes. Not impressed. Service was good and so was the ambience
4
To sum up the lunch, Les Amis is a restaurant that promises classical fine dining without kicking up a fuss. Its techniques were simple and some of it worked. I can imagine this is what retirement feels like. It feels great but a little sedentary and all of it, very rational. Not much fireworks in the food Les Amis presented to us today. The execution was fair but it did not really sweep my peers and I off our feet. My main of chicken was a clear disaster but other dishes like the fish was slightly blend but still yummy. My dining partners were clearly left divided between the scallops and dessert of Alphonso Mango. But for me, I felt that neither was good enough to dampen my disappointment at Les Amis. For a restaurant that boast a position higher than Jaan on Asiaâ€™s 50 Best Restaurant list, I expected a lot more.http://wenywonderswhy.blogspot.com.au/2015/07/singapore-classical-french-dining-les.htm

My second visit to Singapore, I chose Les Amis for a great lunch, as the price, Set lunch at Les Amis offered most valuable and most reachable. The service was so great, our company of 4 got the private room, our server was Burmese, giving us best service and culinary advices. The food was very well done, foie gras and eel was the best combination ever, only pitfall for this menu was the portion, other dishes were good. The ambience was very luxurious and comfy. There was free wifi available, good for point and shoot and upload like me
3
During the three hours we spent in a small private room with a window on the kitchen, we could see that the 10 (or so) chefs worked non-stop. Some of their labour were great (the crispy langoustines), all were good (angel hair pasta with caviar, seared foie gras, artichoke, pork loin) but overall the food was not a wow, as it is at the top French restaurants in Singapore. Superb service and impressive wine list
4
I'm not sure but I continue to feel that Les Amis is still struggling to find its former glory after its recent renovation. On a recent lunch, I thought I will bypass the veal in the set menu (which was good the last time, but hardly memorable). I went for a John Dory substitute from the a la carte menu. This wasn't a major improvement. As a relative regular, I'm not very thrilled by the static menu and lack of choices. The previous menus offered more choices. The mango-based dessert is a classic though, and remains the best part of the set lunch.
5
Celebrating my birthday with friend. We ordered 2 separate menu, 'classic' and 'signature'. Overall everything is good except 'prawn tart' which is nothing special. The base is a bit too soft. The cape mushroom soup is delicious but be careful ... it is very rich and 'heavy' because it cooks with foie gras custard. At the end, they serve us a birthday cake which is just nice for 2 people. We are able to finish everything and yet not feeling too much
5
Everything about this place is amazing. The quality of the food, the price, the service. Highly recommended and I will visit again. My only very small suggestion would be to roast the tomatoes that are served with the veal cheek as opposed to serving them uncooked
5
We had a fabulous 5 course Perrier-Jouet champagne dinner on 9th June 2015.The highlight of the dinner was the "White Asparagus Blanc Mange" is actually a light and delicate jelly of asparagus with oscietra caviar. Wow, this dish is a Michelin star standard. Very delicate taste and beautiful presentation. Everyone at the dinner were singing praises. This dish alone is worth a return visit!The rest of the courses were of very high standard. (Lobster bisque, pan roasted sea bass, pork loin)I also enjoyed the dessert of Alphonso Mango in a sugar sphere with coconut sorbet.We are already planning a return visit in near future
5
had a fab meal and staff were very friendly, not often do you have a meal like we had. Everything was perfection,
amazing in fact!!!
5
We hadn't visited for nearly 15 years, I'm not sure why. The service was charming. A four course lunch for S$80++ wasn't cheap but the food was very good. A smoked salmon starter was thick cut, coated with sesame and melted in the mouth. A layered eel and foie gras dish was less successful, with the eel overpowering the liver. Very well executed mushroom tart and soup. The pigeon ballotine and quail main courses were faultless and puddings were clearly done by a dedicated and talented pastry chef - the chocolate souffle was truly wonderful as was the hazelnut tart. I would go back just for the puddings. The decor is sterile and expensive, which is a shame. There were a quite a few eccentric and wealthy customers but they treated everyone with equal charm
5
Have been coming to this restaurant for I don't know how long, and it just never fails. Eaten through five different chefs, probably four renovations, over the past 20 years or so, and have not been disappointed. Lunch this week was another one of those fail-safe meals where everything seem to fall into place without effort. The food quality was better than expected, and the service, impeccable. At S$80+taxes a person for a four-course lunch, it certainly costs less than going to Amber in Hong Kong, or Robuchon in Macau, but will rank among them as one of the best dining rooms in Asia. So looking forward to my next trip back!
5
We have been to Singapore a number of times but had not been to this restaurant. We tried to get into gunthers French restaurant, but they were booked out. (Thank goodness). Fortunately, we got to go to Les Amis instead! The food and service at Les Amis was first class. Everything was perfect. It's when someone goes above and beyond, it really stands out..... We did not tell the staff it was my birthday, they picked it up in conversations and then brought out a birthday cake. Thoroughly recommend. :
5
I had the good fortune to get invited by a friend to this incredible restaurant and just returned. Restaurants frankly don't get any better than this. Formal wear is a must and frankly this would be the place to wear the nicest thing you own. I even busted out a brand new suit for the occasion and was happy that I did so. The menu was incredible and I will list the various things we tried out. We didn't exactly stick to the set menu because one of the people I was with has a daughter who works at the restaurant and was frankly showing off all the signature items (and I am soooo happy that she did). Good lord. The presentation and explanation of all items was damn impressive and helped me out because several of these items are not on my normal menu :) Here is a list of items we sampled:STEAMED WHITE ASPARAGUSwhite asparagus from provence, served with a traditional mousseline sauceSPECIAL SELECTION OF KRISTAL CAVIARcold angel hair in harmony with black truffle & caviar balanced with an exquisite aroma of kombu &chivesFOIE GRAS & EELpan seared foie gras and french river eel in combination with citrus fruit compote and dashiJAPANESE OMI BEEFgrilled japanese beef with asparagus and traditional "poivrade" sauceBABY LAMBbaby lamb rack from "luberon" with ratatouilleDark Chocolate P125 Souffle withTahiti Vanilla CreamALPHONSO MANGOin a sugar sphere with coconut sorbe

I have always wanted to try this restaurant every time I come to Singapore and finally I got a chance to try it. I am really glad I did!Arriving we were greeted at the door and taken to our table. The setting and ambience is really cozy and inviting after their recent renovation. Service was always friendly and top notch by everyone there and our aperitif order was taken and we were left alone to go through the menu.3 types of degustation menu was on offer and we decided to go for the Signature Menu. I do not want to write about each dish but having dined in many Michelin restaurants worldwide I can proudly say that Les Amis stands there among them. Chef Sebastien Lepinoy has delivered by serving French classics with a light Asian touch where every dish was a mouth watering explosion! The chef did come out at the end of the night and went table to table to chat with the diners. This is always deeply appreciated by guests in my opinion. A special thanks to our sommelier who was excellent and recommended a Chablis to start with the appetisers and a Gigondas which accompanied our lamb perfectly. Thanks for the tour of your impressive wine cellar! (Sadly I forgot his name but he was the Chinese sommelier with spectacles)I will definitely visit Les Amis every time I come to Singapore and you should too
4
The menu was impeccably curated, and I enjoyed the straight-forward simplicity of the dishes, that focused on the integrity of the ingredients and the technique in preparing them. Wine list and selection is one of the best I've seen. Service was excellent and all the staff can anticipate diner needs before they ask. I had the Degustation Menu, and everything on it was divine--yes, it is a bit on the pricy side, but a very good deal for this level of restaurant in Singapore.Highly recommended
5
[http://missneverfull.com/singapore-les-amis-no-13-asias-50-restaurant-2015/]The new menu after 1-month-closure for renovation offers more new dishes! About 10 dishes under each section on the new menu. Love the French food with a Japanese twist. All the food were impressive even the breads and butter, till the complimentary fetit fours. One of fav fine dining resto in SG
4
the staff is very nice and helpful and the chef was in so he came to greet us at our table which is always a plus. The sommelier show us around the wine cellar and was really friendly. The food is very nice and tasty but not mind blowing, and the main course ( pork and mash) was a bit basic. The table for 2 are very close to each other so you can hear quite a lot of the conversation on your side, which is annoying, specially if like us you are seating next to an obnoxious french guy !!! but if you like french cuisine, you should still give it a go
4
A couple of visits over the last month confirms that Les Amis still remains one of the best French restaurants in Singapore. While there has been some turnover in the kitchen, the food remains as good as ever (though it will be good to see them changing the prix fixe menu a bit more often). One of the new dishes - scallops with a sesame soy sauce - is heavenly. What is probably under appreciated is the service, which is excellent, and by Singapore standards, absolutely extraordinary
5
Go for the set lunch and enjoy the great food which is reasonably priced. The service is excellent as the waiters would explain each dish with details.
4
As a stalwart in Singapore fine dining scene, there's a high expectation of Les Amis both in terms of service and food. At least for the former, my score is 10 out of 10. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive, informative, and done with smiles. Knowing that I was by myself, they even provided reading material on the table - a simple gesture, but it made a difference.The food is traditional French (no surprises there), with abundant use of expensive ingredients, especially black truffles. Out of the degustation dishes, the first two were the best for me - the refreshing angel hair with caviar, and the delicate egg confit with onion tart. Some other dishes needed a bit of fine tuning. The verjus sauce for the sea bass was too acidic - it supposed to provide contrast to the fish, not kill its flavor. And the rich meat dish (pigeon breast, bacon, foie gras) could perhaps be made less oily.This restaurant is closing temporarily (a month) for renovation. When it opens again, I hope it's not just the look that gets better and more exciting, but also the food
4
I am not a fan of French cuisine but decided to go to Les Amis as I was meeting my parents for lunch and wanted a good restaurant. It was located at a quiet street in Orchard Road. From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were met with exemplary service. Food was also served promptly. Despite not being a fan of French fare, I enjoyed each and every dish. The food was tantalizing to both the eyes and the tastebuds.The ambience was average and the tables were quite close to one another. We were lucky to have the next table vacant. Otherwise conversations may easily be heard due to the proximity of the next table.All in all, I would definitely go back to Les Amis again for its excellent food and service. Highly recommended
5
I have been twice at les amis for lunch - one for business and one for leisure - and both were a great experience. The lunch menu is very affordable but still offer a great quality meal.The starter, the main dish and the desert were excellent. High quality french food with great taste and presentation. Service is also very good and definitely up to the restaurant s reputation.
4
I've visited Les Amis the first time last December for their Christmas festive lunch. I was instantly allured by the interior. I've always passed by when they were closed, trying to peep into it but to no avail. The marble walls, the selective carpet flooring, up till the details towards a bag stool and all, I like that. It was a beautifully crafted menu and each dish was presented with intricacy and the lobster emulsion is definitely worth every single cent extra. It's luscious, creamy and full of lobster! I'm not sure if they still serve that, but it's definitely worth a try! All the dishes that were presented had nothing to fault in terms of taste, but I really just wish their main course size could be a little bigger. It's a lunch and I definitely can afford to fill up my stomach a little bit more. The service is good, but I feel a little old-school. It lacks a touch a personality. But all in all, this is a great place to come, for good food, their extensive wine list, and a good ambience
3
I wish the decor, service and atmosphere matched the quality of the food here. I'm not sure it should have made the San Pellegrino top 50 Asians best restaurants - food alone, yes. Whole package, I think there's better. Diner for two was $800US for tasting with wine. Waku Gin was only marginally more at about $1000US and that meal was significantly better. It's good, don't get me wrong, but the value and experience factor just wasn't there
5
i went to Les Amis for lunch on Christmas day,a great experience, we opted for the first menu with the additional course, $95 for 5 courses.Amazing ingredients used, langoustine, lobster, truffle, veal... everything was perfectly executed, I wished for a small "amuse bouche" but nevermind as it was all good. We had an extra dessert, not sure why, but i believed it was a mistake as our dessert came just a minute after.Great wine list, very reasonably priced... service was very good, they know their job. It was a first time for me, and I will definitely come back
5
i went to Led Amis for lunch over the holidays and was once again reminded of how good this food group is. The pix fix menu options for lunch are exceptional value and the quality of food is nothing less than extraordinary: oysters with caviar, foie gras, squab, dessert and complimentary truffles all for 100. I think many diners think of this restaurant as "expensive," but the truth is that it is easy to spend twice as much as many Japanese restaurant for food that is nowhere near as good. Thanks les Amis
5
A truly wonderful lunch! We had a special degustation tasting menu with six courses. Linguini with caviar, scallops on the shell was so beautiful, foie gras, sea bass which was divine, wagyu marbling no. 5 just melting in the mouth. Warm purple passion soufflÃ© with coco ice and chocolate truffles was over the top! Service and execution was superb, we were on the run with a flight to catch! They did it perfectly without rushing. A place not to be missed if you want refined French in Singapore
5
Decided to grab lunch before my movie at shaw lido. Was deciding between Aoki and Les Amis, and Aoki was already full. I was in berms (nice ones though, ha) but they nicely accommodated meThey have 3 set lunches - $55, 70 and 125 and I chose the $70 which has 4 courses. The bread basket was great with freshly baked goods. Started with scallops , beautifully cooked. Next was foie gras, again very nice, albeit a small portion. There is a wide array of mains to choose from, and we took the angel hair with ebi, which I usually choose. Great as usual , but we noted something peculiar. Mine was almost al dente and nice. My friend's portion had a lot more gravy. So there's a consistency and plating issue and we told our waiter, who told the chef about it. Dessert was a nice pistachio cream dessert. There was also complimentary tea/coffee with petit fours, like all posh establishments Overall another good lunch
5
Food has improved since Chef Sebastian moved from Hong Kong to Singapore. White truffle set very good value for money with lots of white truffle. Worth another visit if you were previously disappointed.
5
We came just for a quick lunch.
It was great. Very adequate personel. Lovely food and great service. The price is not to high. It was perfect. Tomorrow we go back. Thanks.
5
we had a business dinner at les amis. what can we say - great flavours, presentation and top notch service.
5
Excellent French cuisine. They have apparently brought in a new chef (versus a year ago) from their restaurant in Hong Kong. The menu was very good, innovative but not too much, lots of tastes and flavors. Very good wine list. Would definitely go back.
4
This is one of my favorite restaurant for French cuisine and it always works well for me and my clients.I love their breads and choices of wine.Their crispy langoustine is excellent. The scottish salmon confit & beef tartare is my favourites for appetiser.The dessert of the day was very good too
3
We arrived late for lunch, and took a mixture of the five and four course menus. Perhaps of our late arrival the lunch felt slightly rushed. The food was well cooked, and finely presented. I do prefer more robust flavouring though, particularly in a context of a diet of Singaporean spices and curries more broadly. The service was wonderful
5
Good food, well cooked, beautifully presented and impeccably served in elegant surroundings. What more can one ask for?A soft-boiled egg in filo with mushroom duxelle was gorgeous; the foie gras withsmoked eel I was uncertain about, but the flavours were magnificent; the crab was deliciously sweet, the sea bass was firm and the seafood jus was to die for; pan-roasted medallion of venison was melt-in-the-mouth with a caramelised searing that justadded to the excitement and the de-constructed apple crumble was a veritable revelation which looked as if it wouldn't work, but in the mouth was fabulous

11月6日の女子会で利用時に、受付係にお尻を触られました。A receptionist touched my bottom intentionally on my visit of 06 November 2014 for my girls gathering. テーブルに着く際、椅子を引いてくれたので、座ろうとしたら、左手のひらで触られました。黒人さんとまではいきませんが、肌が浅黒い人で、受付、お皿の回収、会計をしていました。一番早くにお店に着いたので、奥の椅子を勧められましたが、手前の椅子に座ったのにもかかわらず触られました。料理は日本人の口にも合う味付けでとてもおいしかったですが、二度と行きません。女性だけで行かれる際は、十分気をつけてください。He pulled my chair to assist me to take seat and touched my bottom with his left Palm just before I sat down. He even asked me to choose the chair behind wall rather than the one on aisle before I sat down. He has shallow dark skin, not too dark, handles reception work, collecting plates and cashing.The dishes are beautiful and delicious as we expected,however we would never want to come back. Please be very careful when you go there with girls only
5
We managed to get in to Les Amis at short notice (albeit on a week night) and we are so glad we did. It was actually one of the highlights of our few days in Singapore. The degustation menu (s) at Les Amis are not cheap. We chose two different menus but that didn't seem to phase them and despite a slightly different course structure the meal was executed in a very professional manner by the knowledgeable and efficient staff. The ambience is modern and elegant but what you really come here for is the food.. Its imaginative but not over the top with foams and 'earth' like some places these days. Wonderful use of flavour combinations. Very hard to pick a favourite. Amazing wine list.All in all a good find, and definitely one of our best (and probably most expensive) meals ever
4
Wanted to try some thing more up market in Singapore. Dined here for lunch on Monday just gone. Went with two mates from Melbourne. Service was spot on, the ambience is smart modern and you could be anywhere in the world.We went for the lowest cost 4 course menu, but they were happy to change the rum baba dessert to the souffle which was on the 2nd 4 course option.The first course was a harricot bean salad with foie gras, smart presentation, a nice course but nothing to write home about. The second course of foie gras ravioli in a chicken broth was sublime with the option of adding in a chilli creme fraiche. The third course was very good, NZ lamb, cooked to perfection and the potato mash was like velvet. The interesting side was the Pommery mustard ice cream, so the textures/colours and temperatures made nice contrasts. The souffle was good not startling. As mentioned there is a bread basket which gives you a choice of three breads.Wine list was on the expensive side but the have a lunch special of half bottles at a reasonable $35 a bottle, we had a William Fevre Chablis 2012 and a Rioja Vina Ardanza 2004, both most pleasant. Coffee for a restaurant was good. Very good value for money. Would definitely go back when next in Singapore
4
Lunch packet is the way to go. French food with an Asian twist. Friendly service in a nice environment. Haven't been for dinner, but there are a few different set menus
4
Nice French food in a bit cold environment. Staff does not really know what they serve but is friendly. The for quality is good but it does not deserve a one start Michelin since it is fundamentally basic food but fresh.
5
Visited this restaurant for Lunch. The food is an absolute bliss, the service is right on, The Best. When serving you your dish, the waiters will describe the dish and ingredients in it. The best is they surprised me with a small birthday dish (not too sure what it was but it was THE BEST CHOCOLATE I've ever tasted) I didn't even tell them it was my birthday, maybe they overhead my conversation thats why. But anyway, I would difinetly recommend this place. It may be abit pricey, but you do get excellent food and quality service which is hard to find in Singapore restaurants nowadays
4
Whilst having visited Singapore numerous times for many years we had never been to Les Amis. It is a fairly nondescript building and upon entering found the decor rather simple but elegant. A little brightly lit for our liking we asked to move tables as I had a light shining right in my eyes. We were very impressed with our food , the degustation menu was interesting with some unusual dishes. We chose the Epicurien menu that included lobster salad to begin, foie gras custard with eel, and then a quail egg on an onion tart with truffle which was just amazing. A pea soup followed by duck breast which was also very delicious. We chose to have cheese instead of dessert, great selection of cheese. Forgot to mention the fantastic freshly baked bread rolls!! It was all very rich food and did not make for a pleasant sleep that evening, I think I would prefer to eat a meal like that in the day and then walk it off afterwards. One thing we were disappointed with in a number of restaurants including here was that when you order an expensive bottle of champagne they are not chilled they keep them in the cellar. Its a hot climate ?? so they put them on ice which of course takes half an hour almost?? There Dom Perignon 2004 which we drink all the time was the most expensive we have seen it for in Singapore and it was warm!
5
I went back to Les Amis for lunch on 22.7.2014. The 4-course set lunch was excellent the last time i came on 1.4.2014. :-) & today again it did not disappoint. Wife ordered 1/2 bottle white pinot noir. It was good. The bread basket was good. baguette, brioche & sour dough were all good. The roll wife said not good. I did not try.#1 the crispy langoustine was excellent packed with meat tasted just like very tender lobster, & it was such a large helping.#2 the foie gras was kind of monstrous. & it was very good too. so was the smoked eel (super!) & cherries.#3 the 2 main course options were wild scottish salmon confit & tartare OR beef tartare. beef tartare is 1 of my favourites for appetiser. this one though was a main & it was quite tasty. this preparation had quite a bit of herb. it was very good but i would prefer to have less herb & a more dominant sweet tasting beef.the salmon confit & tartare was very good as well. a poached or baked salmon tends to be more chunky. this confit was medium rare & had a bit of the texture of cured salmon or sashimi. very nice. beef tartare came with a good french fries.#4 the dessert of the day was very good too. I really like the quality set lunch here, and it offered good value at S$45++pax, similarly to their sister outlet au jardin which had regrettably ceased operations.

Delectable food in an exclusive restaurant with simple yet elegant décor. When the bread was served, we knew we were in for a great meal - A fine selection of hot freshly baked bread with tempting mounds of butter and sea salt. The cold angel hair with caviar, black truffle quail egg onion tart, pan seared foie gras and crispy langoustine are highly recommended.Leave space for dessert - The warm chocolate tart with hazelnut ice cream was a brilliant end to a great meal
4
Les Amis has been around since 1994, so one of the earlier fine-dining establishments in Singapore. It got a new chef last year, but the tradition of French cuisine with some Asian tweaks has remained consistent. It's high quality food with excellent service. There are several menu options but the S$55 four-course lunch is a triumph. It's a bargain introduction to the food - but be warned that it's not particularly inexpensive to drink here. My two glasses of wine (a champagne and a red) came in at S$58! Still, it's a treat
4
I was invited for a business dinner in one of the private room. It was a set menu French oriented with some twists on the presentation and asian products. La langue de veau was good so was the appetiser around salmon. The service is excellent and the restaurant very classy. Cannot comment on the prices i was invited.Saw the wine cellar with some gorgeous Bourgogne!So a good french restaurant away from France ( good bread and choice of butter)

a good friend bought lunch at les amis on 1.4.2014. no april fool haha. i must have not stepped into les amis for 5, maybe 10 years? though i did have excellent meals at au jardin (it’s now closed) couple times a year. always thought it was very ex…some months back they introduced this 4-course set lunch. having taken the food, i think it is excellent value-for-money at S$45pax, one of the nest lunches i had. we started with a bread basket of baguette, sour dough & a very good walnut bread PLUS a truly superb bread (brioche texture) with olive, sundried tomatoes? etc. just fabulous! #1 & the tomato confit was incredible! :-) it was on a bed of grilled aubergine on filo pastry. there are tomato confit & there are tomato confit, but this was just excellent!#2 green pea soup not my favourite, but this was again very good indeed! very smooth & nicely creamy. i may get to like green pea soup a bit more.#3 there was a choice of patagonia toothfish (chilean seabass, my favourite fish, over cod) OR roast pigeon. both of us took the chilean sea bas. it was as good as chilean seabass usually were. the sweet red cabbage was ok but not quite my type – i finished about 40% of it.while this fish never fails to meet expectations as you need a bad chef to screw this up, the tomato confit way surpassed expectations – most places would get it bad or mediocre.#4 the dessert of the day a walnut apple pie? was likewise not my favourite, but again it was superbly done. :-) fillings not sickeningly sweet & very good pastry. the chilled chocolate mousse was very good too.the S$60 lunch menu came with line caught seabass & choice of lobster pasta & australian wagyu etc. i had some doubts on the line-caught thingy being any different from usual & seabass like low down c/w the chilean seabass but the cooking standards here really good i will probably try it.i was also curious about the 6-course S$120 menu. it said grilled dry aged beef so i asked the waiter (he was very knowledgeable) why this was better than the australian wagyu in the S$60 menu. he said it was OHMI WAGYU! i told him omg! ohmi (a top 3 japanese wagyu) & you don’t write that in your menu? my, my!i had an excellent degustation at jaan on 20.1.2014 with some friends recently, and we were lucky to trade our pigeon (which was good too) for miyazaki dry-aged wagyu, but this was ohmi, not miyazaki!i told the waiter this the second time i came across dry-aged japanese wagyu (first was jaan). dry ageing intensifies the flavours & results in substantial weight lost. japanese wagyu is so ex & already very marbled & very intense in flavours i don’t see them served dry aged in japan.

Visited Les Amis in June 14, this being the 2nd visit. We took the 5 course Degustation set this time- Delicious French food served using the freshest ingredients plated in a beautiful and artistic way. Complimentary bread basket and a choice of 8 different flavours of butter to go along. Service is top notched in this fine dining restaurant, which has stood the test of time as other fine dining places come and go. I spend abt $200 per pax including a half bottle of wine to share. Will recommend this place +++.

in singapore u can eat very cheaply or expensively. this is a great place to eat for value. everything was very proper. food was reasonable and extremely good value. some dishes were really quite well done, while some others were average.
5
The food, wine and service are excellent. There are 3 taster menus, which are all on the punchy side in price terms. So, the way I see it, you may as well go for the top end if you're there in the first place. It won't disappoint.If I had to be critical, I'd say it feels a bit old in there, like only octogenarians frequent the place. That's not the case clearly and its decor is quite modern, so maybe it's just who my co-patrons were on that particular night
4
In retrospect this place was reasonable value for high end food.... $45 for 4 courses (no wine) My friend came for the angel hair pasta and gasped at the size of the dish ... Very small! Everything was pretty tiny, though exquisitely presented. I had a little quibble with some courses, perhaps I was just in a bad mood...Tomato jelly with avocado cream, the raw garlic should have been minced more finely ...fois gras (faultless), quail with ratatouille ....tasted a bit odd but maybe that's how it should taste.. Quail is not my favourite game bird and I think ratatouille is an odd pairing... Little dessert was pretty ... A little floating island with caramel hoops like a confectioner's gyroscope. Nice bread basket and madeleines with the coffee, a Proustian moment. Service was excellent, pitched just right. The atmosphere is hushed. I disliked the decor intensely ... Narrow room, very high ceilings, veiled windows (no view anyway)... Not a fun place... Others obviously liked it as it was crowded for a Monday. I just felt it lacked something .... Laughter probably..

After I sat down, I realised I hadn't been here for 5 years. Why? I can't remember - in Singapore we are spoiled for choice?We had the set lunch, always a treat when prices have a ceiling.Delicious bread basket, withe appetizers. morsels of finely sliced tomatoes over eggplant caviar. delicious. Then a baked scallop with a thin light soy sauce. That went down well too. When the main arrived, we were glad that this was also not a substantial slab of many bites. Lightly baked wild salmon with a delicate accompaniment of scented salmon mince. For someone lactose intolerant, the dessert of pannacotta (soy!) with mikan and lime foam hit the spot!Washed down with a generous glass of bubbly - it was the perfect lunch to start the long Easter weekend!Blissfully Blessed

We had the 5 course set menu and thoroughly enjoyed every course. This is a very good restaurant. we found the preparation of the food interesting as it has the Asian touch to it so it is not necessarily what you may have dreamed up what the dish was going to look like. Service was very attentive and friendly as we found normal everywhere we went in Singapore. There were locals eating there, so as they often say in Asian cities if the locals eat there it must be good. Great wine list with all the usual French Bordeaux suspects at some seriously big price tags but there is something for everyone. You won't be disappointed and it right in the heart of towm atj the Shaw Centre corner, Scotts Road and Orchard Roa

My husband and I went went to Les Amis last night to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Our table was in a corner next to a long sideboard where there were lots of wineglasses, bottled water and .... a table fan! Wow, superb ambiance. I felt like we were in our neighbourhood zi char coffeeshop albeit with better dressed people. To think the restaurant spent all that money on the decor and then have a dinky little table fan as part of the decor. Throughout the evening, one of the waiters would wander past us to fetch water or whatever was on the sideboard. And to add insult to injury or add to the atmosphere (?), one of the waiters nonchalantly turned up the fanspeed a notch. The food? When my husband called to make a reservation, he specifically checked that they have an ala carte menu. I am not fond of degustation/prix fixe menus and was assured that they do serve ala carte. Well, they kind of do. You can select an entree from any one of the three or four set menus and they will serve that to you as per an ala carte item. BUT the portion will be as per the set menu size. i.e. tiny. So, that of course meant we had to select a few items for our starter, a couple for our entree etc. What a joke. I have never been to Les Amis before and thought it would be quite nice to go to a restaurant that has been around since my husband and I were dating. Should have gone to Waku Ghin instead

I was a little apprehensive before visiting Les Amis for the first time after reading some mixed reviews and concerned that it may have been a but stale but was pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent, right from the tray of different butters to try with bread to the constant topping of the water glasses. They have 3 different set menus and were happy to substitute one of the dishes from another menu onto the one that we chose ,but watched another table mix and match from all 3 menus - I wish we had know that was possible. The food was all very tasty and beautifully presented , although portions are on the small side which is fine for me but may not be to everyone's liking. We will go back again at some point , and next time will look to take advantage of the amazing wine list
2
Being here is nice, all the past reviews I hear...The food didn't meet the expectant patron... Service is ok... Nice ambience but if you think you want an epicurean experience, give it a miss... You will find better ambience with impeccable service and exquisite food elsewhere...Indeed a fallen repute to its iconic past...
5
Set menu diner was suberb, this venue is an iconic "must go" for the gourmets.From the freshest ingredients, the chef delivered tender and delicious duck breast.The wine list is certainly second to none in Singapore and the pairing advises from the knowledgeable sommelier were perfect.Beeing around in Singapore for so long is not an easy achievement, so well done 
5
It is not easy for a restaurant to survive in singapore for more than 10 years. But Les Amis did! Service was good and every dish of the degustation menu was delicious. The wine list was extensive and the sommelier made very apt recommendations for us.Will definitely go back a second time
5
Excellent dinner, fine wine pairing and subtle truffle flavor in all dishes. We enjoyed this set menu dinner very much , one of the finest we ve had in a long time.
4
Dined on 19th October 2013. They only had 3 set menus. $150?, $208?,$288? or $388?. We had the $208 set. Its a mixture of French and Japanese. Very interesting. Bread was very good. Service excellent. I was told it is worth having lunch here.
5
We booked a private dining room for a business meeting, the food was great, the bread was amazing and we got a very good service from the restaurant staff.
5
Food is wonderful, I adore oysters and this restaurant knows how to manage oysters with aplomb as well as all the other brilliant food they do. Price is not cheap but worth every cent
3
This used to be the only decent restaurant in Singapore. That was a long time ago. Had the epicurean menu. Main course has 2 slivers of duck breast, skinless. Lobster in piddle of bisque covered by daikon and crisp vegetable pearls. Room temperature "cold" angel hair pasta. Produce ingredients to be fair wee of excellent quality. It's the talent of the chef. Or the margins imposed by the owners. Shame. This was after 2 yr absence. That previous time we were served someone's half eaten butter but at least rolls served. This evening it was a basket left at the table. Try Gunther's better cooking, same quality, better value and better service. good but tired.
5
Les Amis has withstood the test of time and despite the fierce competition in the local scene, this restaurant consistently scored high as a fine dining establishment. Our large group (20+) had a very good lunch here and amidst the buzz of such a big group, Raymond and his team did not allow the slightest slip in all food and drinks served. Service was truly impeccable that not many other restaurants can match up to
5
I've been to Les Amis on many occasions, to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and Christmas. It has always been top notched to me in many aspects, food, presentation, ambiance, service and quality. From the warm welcome at the door and all throughout dinner, you enjoy the attentive service that goes with the excellent food. I did notice some slight but noticeable difference in the food when they changed chefs some time back. It lost a little of it's "wow" factor for a bit. I think the worst thing I ever had was a roasted suckling pig one or two years back. The meat, while tender and its texture superb, was overpowered by the "porky" taste that really spoilt the dish. Even the presentation of its food was somewhat different but it still managed to remain consistent in being one of the better restaurants in Singapore
5
The chef clearly knows what he is doing, very subtle dishes, very good bread, interesting seaweed butter. The supper menus take a while, but it is worth the trouble, especially with a good bottle of wine to while away the time. It's worth spending on some good wine to accompany the food, so your budget should not really be less than $1000 for two, although you can get by on $500.Ambience is very understated, a little old-fashioned but in a pleasant way. Service is very good, professional, much better than Au Jardin in the botanic garden, which is also part of the same group
3
The restaurant was smaller than I had expected. But understanding the fact that it has been in business for over a decade, I can relate. The lunch service was basically three different pricing with a choices ranging from 4 course to 8 course degustation set. The sommelier was quite assertive in helping in pairing wine with our meal, where we gladly obliged. The starter was very nice, wonderful presentation. The bread basket was also excellent, comparable to the quality that are served in Michelin star restaurant in Paris. The main course, which I had Scottish salmon was average. The finale, dessert, was presented nicely. What I found awkward was that coffee/tea service was not included in the set menu. I found the service delivery could have been a bit more refined, given that it is a legacy and it does have a reputation to upkeep. The delivery of service and feedback with the diner's could be a bit more efficient and attentive. Knowing that the restaurant business is ever competitive in the Singapore, I find that the design of the menu and delivery could be a tad more updated to continue its legacy. Overall, I would give the experience 7 points based on a 10 point scale

Visited here on a Monday evening, probably not the best night to go in terms of atmosphere. We had one of their set menus, choice of three available, they were very flexible in terms of allowing a bit of mixing to go on from one menu to another. Service was extremely good, food presentation was fantastic and the taste delicious. Wine list was comprehensive and reasonably priced
4
The place is a little hard to find for visitors. Its location is hidden in one of the off-roads. The restaurant is small but cosy. I had an excellent five course dinner with attentive and smiling waiters. Very good service.
2
We had high expectations of this highly touted place since new chef Pinoy took over. Sadly they were not fulfilled and we four left eight hundred dollars poorer for a very indifferent meal. Think of a prix fixe lunch in a main street restaurant in a small French town but multiply the price by ten. Great wine list and service only highlighted the shortcomings of the food
5
We took our mother here for dinner during the week... She absolutely loved it and so did we.... Nice touch at the end of the evening... A take home box of petit fours..... If only I could eat here every month... Pricey but worth it if you want to empress that special someone.... Gotta love the amusee bouche before the courses start arriving... Amazin
5
Les Amis is one of Singapore's best known restaurants. The service is exceptional but it should be. You get what you pay for, says the old adage. Knowing some of the Group staff from other outlets such as Caveau. Welcome excellent, table excellent, glass of champagne, excellent. Oysters with just the right dressing. Had oysters at Zafferanos the day before and the dressing missed the mark by a mile. Trying to be too creative....simple is good. The ham was to die for. The lamb was not the best but cooked well. The cheese is very good but extremely expensive although it has come a long way! Wine list is probably the best in Sing for French. Chose an almost 20 yr old Bordeaux that had clearly been kept well as you would expect of such an establishment. Came away having thoroughly enjoyed it but tried not to look at the bill
5
We went here this week, as a birthday treat from a friend.Well chosen!Service was immediate and discreet. The bread and little, free appetisers arrived very fast.The 3 selections of bread available were crusty and delicious and served with 2 types of butter.We ordered off the set menu, mainly as it looked good. It arrived after a short wait.I had White asparagus with cheese gratin as a starter. Asparagus was fresh, well cooked, slightly crunchy and delicious.I followed this with medallions of lamb. I asked for medium rare and my friend asked for medium well done. Both dishes arrived and were cooked perfectly. Sounds easy but many chefs struggle to cook and time lamb that well. My lamb was REALLY good. Tasty, soft, melt-in-the-mouth delicious. I am not an expert but it tasted fresh (not cooked from frozen) to me ... not easy to do in Singapore!After this, I had eaten enough, even though the chocolate soufflÃ© on the menu was tempting.While my friend's wife was enjoying her mango dessert, we were all brought lemon madeleines, with some lemon sauce. "Oh dear", I thought. "Yet another stale, tasteless madeleine, to make me drink more." ... No. They were AWESOME! Subtle lemon flavour from super-fresh madeleines with very citric, lemon sauce perfectly complementing the pastry.Well done all chefs and well done for perfect service.We'll go back
5
Came here for lunch as this place has become 1 of my friend's fav, despite some of the vitriol here. Place was quite empty, probably some folks scared away by the reviews. I've been here 5 times in the past 8 years, but haven't been here in the last 3 years, so coming here with "fresh eyes"There was the 3 or 4 course lunch menu, and we also opted for the half bottle of white. Their wine list has always been great, and the house white was good. The amuse bouche of chilled asparagus soup with cavier was good. My starter of egg confit with iberico ham ($15 supplement) was tasty and hearty. The main of angel hair with spicy shrimp is delightful, but a little similar to Iggy's and Ember. The chocolate souffle dessert was excellentOverall good food, service and company to chase the monday blue
2
Just came back from my anniversary dinner. The place was dead for a Friday night. We took the five courses menu at 190++ per person. First, the bread arrives hard and cold as a stone. The dishes were very small portions and uninspiring. The presentation of the dishes was a mess. The pork (it could be beef for that price) was hard with a simple reducted brown sauce, plain and boring. No veggie accompanying any of the main. Dessert was a "deconstructed" lemon pie that I joked with my wife it was more like "destructed" being a huge plate with pieces of pie here and there. To top it up they serve the meat with a ridiculous plastic-like PINK knife. No kidding I took a picture. Ambient stuffy and very 80s. Service not bad but they have filled up my glass of water more often at Billy Bombers. Maitre going around and never passed by the table to ask how was everything or congratulate us for our anniversary (this class of restaurant usually do it) Final bill with two glasses of wine (very average wine at SD$25++) was SD$600. Auch! I have been in many many better restaurants in Singapore. It is just not worth it
2
I had dinner in this restaurant with my aunty and for the price we paid the food and the service were below our expectations.If you have dinner in restaurants like Les Amis you expect to be served according the normal standard rules (for example: serving from the right side) but unfortunately these rules were not really respected.We ordered the 4 course menu (160$) but some dishes were embarrassing (for example the second course: simple asparagus with chicken!The only thing that was really exceptional and particular was the scallop tartar!! One of the best dishes I ever had. Moreover I drank an excellent wine, Segla Margaux 2006, which compensated part of the disappointing dishes.The atmosphere is very cosy and the waiters very friendly
5
We went there after our shopping so a bit underdressed for fine dining, the service attendant was very thoughtful to give us a private room. The cold angel hair pasta with white truffle had an aroma that was really unforgettably good . The signature homemade paste had an Oriental flavour also a very good alternative if you want to try an unique fusion pasta. The wagyu beef, scallops and lobster were all so superb in taste and presentation.Their deserts or pre main course refreshment were really interesting. Could you imagine sunny side up that looked like fried egg was actually made of pineapple juice and pepper? The other creative deserts like coconut, jackfruit would also spice up your dining experience. The sophisticated innovation would challenge your taste buds and also feast your eyes
4
Perhaps THE place to get ShabuShabu in Singapore, Les Amis has a lovely ambience. The service is attentive but not well informed. There is a maitre d' who is Japanese but he cannot be expected to explain the menu to every table. The non-shabu2 items were exceptionally delicious and exceptionally SMALL servings. And disappointingly they were set to come AFTER the ShabuShabu meal? We had to request them to come first and they were very slow to come. We were absolutely famished by the time the first dishes arrived. Given the price point of this restaurant, I think the staff needs better training, the kitchen needs to get on the ball (it was not busy), and they could give slightly larger portions (it is shabushabu NOT kaiseki) That being said, the food was extraordinarily good. If you are on a expense account and have a lot of time on your hands, it's a very good choice
4
Celebrated our wedding anniversary . Once again the service was impecable , wines was delicious and the 4 course meal was sumptuous and innovative . Compliments to the entire team at Les Amis that worked seamlessly as a team.
4
I firmly recommend Les Amis, the food was good, inventive and modern international cuisine and the winelist was amazing, and with some very good prices for certain wines. Well worth a visit!
4
Expense account only and warn your boss before you go. This would be a second tier restaurant in NYC with Daniel prices plus. Wine list is so expensive it's brutal. I understand that booze is 100% taxed, but show some creativity and get some quality wines at bearable prices. Food is excellent and the dining room is very nice. Right off Orchard road but sandwiched in between malls. But for you corporate guys, it is close to the 4 floors of.....!!!!! I had a hard time justifying taking customers to this restaurant....welcome to Singapore
4
Set menu available as well as a la carte, environment everything is just lovely I could quite happily spend a long afternoon here. Service impeccable wish there was more places in SGP like it, ok it's an in the upper price bracket but you really don't mind it's great and quality superb
1
Short review here – this restaurant feels like a throwback to olden days – very dated 80’s décor and cuisine, nothing imaginative at all here. Average service, table setting pretty poor (holes in tablecloth, really?!) and at this price, simply completely incoherent for the choices one has in Singapore with the new offers in MBS and RWS
3
I have to start with the background - almost 7 years ago my siblings and me took our Mum here for her milestone birthday whilst in Singapore it was an absolutely fabulous night and we have pleasant memories. Fast forward to 5 years ago and I took my partner here for his milestone birthday another fantastic night and yes we have really happy memories of that night.We were recently in Singapore and we thought we would have one big night out would it be Iggys or Les Amis? I chose Les Amis - big mistake.The Hotel arranged the booking and we arrived about 10 minutes early and were promptly seated. I knew we were not off to a good start when the greetings are robotic and the only drink order taken was for some mineral water. Menus arrived and that was it for awhile.Finally I managed to gain someones attention and ordered a bottle of Champagne. The waiter arrived for the food order, took it, proceeded to leave - I still had the wine list on the table and had to ask if I could order some wine.The food arrived and yes the wagyu was absolutely beautiful but everything else was less than inspiring. Paid the bill slightly over a S$1000.00 and we left.We shall never return to Les Amis again, it has lost that special quality that was evident so many years ago. Perhaps there is truth in the saying that one should never revisit a special place/restaurant or Hotel because the memory will never be the same
3
We visited Les Amis to try out their lunch, thinking it might give us a feel for the place before going for the much more expensive dinner.Lunch was pretty uninspiring. The mains were very basic and felt like a token effort rather than an opportunity to impress you into returning for dinner. They were perfectly edible and ok, but did nothing to show off what the chef or kitchen was capable of. One of the desserts was very good and really highlighted the lack of effort in the mains - they are clearly capable of excellent food, but equally clearly consider lunch to be worth the bother.Even more of a problem was the lack of trust in our server. We should have given enough clues of our foodieness and cheese appreciation in particular for our server to pick up on. We'd decided we'd like to try a small selection of their cheese and told the server so when making our initial order. He never consulted us on which cheese we'd like (and they did have an extensive cheese board) and when the bill arrived we'd been charged for two serves at $20 each, and these serves were not very large. The cost was not than unexpected for cheese in a fancy restaurant, so we didn't query the bill, but I do query the "I'll look after you" attitude followed by the maximum pricing possible. If you are going to take matters into your own hands as the server, you want to make doubly sure that you are giving your customers what they want and/or a great deal, preferably both! Compare this to our meal at Gunther's where we asked for a small amount of cheese to share, and we got to choose the cheeses we wanted, and our server piled up huge mounds of cheese as we were having a nice chat, and the cost of the cheese at the end of the meal: $15. The two approaches were like (ahem) chalk and cheese, and I know which I prefer

Just had dinner at Les Amis last evening during our visit in Singapore. I found this restaurant name on the list of the book Les Grandes Tables Du Monde and gave it a try. My husband and I were really looking forward to a good meal but ended up disappointed. Dishes are over priced with such small portion and not that good in taste. Besides there are not much choice on the menu. My husband had half dozen of French oysters highly recommended by the host but they didn't taste good at all with pieces of oyster shell in each one(SD16/oyster). We then had each of us white asparagus soup with several pieces of asparagus and shrimps which costs SD35/person. I had baby lamb as main course which was only a tiny piece of lamb with two slices of eggplant and some deep fried potato cubes and two tiny baby carrots. My husband had Japanese flying fish which was so small and fishy as well. I could smell the odor sitting next to my husband.For dessert, I had coconut ice cream which had the form of a tiny cracked open coconut with chocolate as shell , tiny pieces of mango, and lime cream with Thai basil. This was the best dish that I had for the entire dinner and the presentation is marvelous.We didn't even order wine, just warm water and a bottle of sparkling water, plus one cup of tea and coffee. The total price was over SD500 + 10% service charge.I don't think we will go back there again even the service was very good
3
Hadn't been to Les Amis for a while although my daughter & I were fans. Been to Les Amis the 3rd time this year. Was impressed with the food the 1st 2 times although the service was spotty. Went recently in June when I heard about the departure of head chef. Was curious to see if there's any significant impact. Sadly to say, the recent experience was a let-down. Not as good as before. The Chinese lady staff was rambling on about the food - it was quite clearly that she was just repeating what she has been told rather than what she understood the dish to be. I was shocked that she was clearing my guest's dish before she could finished her last piece. Quite embarassing for a fine dining restaurant. Should have staff with better training
4
Visited here one Friday night, and was treated to some fantastic service, which is so unusual in Singapore! The food was great too, we chose one of the set menus with matching wines, and spent a very pleasant 3hrs enjoying great food and wine. Amazing selections of cheese as well. Expensive, but v. nice for a treat/special occasion
5
there is nothing to hate about, and everything to love about. the service, and the food are simply beyond culinary extraordinare
3
Food is very good, but not out of this world (which it should be for the prices). Also, the decor is pretty boring and unimpressive. I wouldn't go back unless someone else was paying.
5
Fantastic wine cellar, great food albeit expensive. Lunches are more attainable and still high quality. Great place to dine for special occasions.
4
I ve visited there a couple of times and impressed with the wine selection there as it s difficult to find good Burgundy wine in singapore. (although it s not too impressive compared to the rest of the world...) but again Burgundy wine in singapore is overpriced so just be prepared to pay more.. and dont get disappointed
1
The food is extremely over priced and the quality does not reflect the high prices in anyway shape or form. Probably the worst French restaurant I have ever been to in my life. The grilled squid for starters was chewy and un edible. The monk fish as the main course was as ugly as the fish itself (google monk fish to understand) the desert was the cherry in top for the worst dinner I had in Singapore
5
We have been coming to Les Amis for at least once a year for the last 12 years even though the restaurant had changed hands since it opened in 1994. Amin Leitgeb now helms the kitchen with a devotion to freshness of ingredients that is perhaps undersung in the crowded high end dining scene of Singapore. His Maine lobster with spinach and artichoke in sauce bordelais was truly exceptional: the lobster was succulent but not chewey and the unique sauce made it pair beautifully with a Colgin Syrah. Lobster and red wine usually don't go well together resulting in the wine tasting "tin-ny". The 2,000 labels in the cellar with immaculate wine service helped secured it a Wine Spectator Grand Award. As a collector, there is no other restaurant in town I would entrust my 40+ year-old Bordeaux to open and serve. The Angus beef steak was perfectly done medium and tender without the super high fat that an equivalent cut of Waygu beef comes with. For that special celebratory dinner, we always come here even though MBS has many more celebrity chef restaurants. If you could manage it, come on a Tuesday night when the $80 corkage fee is waived. Now, that's your chance to crack open that well-aged claret, sit back and enjoy the magical food of Chef Amine and feel really good that food gets to be this good in Singapore
5
les amis is a great place for a romantic date. service is excellent and food was really good. my partner and i had one set each and it was definitely very filling. if you don't fancy anything on their set menu, let them know and they'll gladly change it for you too. place was really elegant and nice. pricey place though

Les Amis is the restaurant to visit if you wish to impress anyone with the best in fine dining in Singapore.Currently ranked at 55th position in the Best Restaurant in the World (based on opinions and experiences of over 800 international restaurant industry experts), do not expect dining at Les Amis to be inexpensive. That said, for the money spent, one will get the best dining experience in terms of the display in the finest of culinary art, coupled with top-notch service.On Valentine’s Day 2012, I had the privilege of hitting my 20th Valentine milestone with the love of my life. I decided to give Les Amis the opportunity to live up to its reputation. It did (for details please continue reading).The Valentine dinner menu on that day was themed Traditional & Modern. It was a 7 course meal. Each course was served with delicatessen prepared in the traditional way, as well as the modern approach using the art of Molecular Gastronomy. Only a world class chef is able to pull off such a feat for all the 7 complex dishes on the menu. In total, there were 14 mini servings – 7 traditional and 7 modern. It was a delight just watching each of the dishes coming out of the kitchen in pairs of “Traditional & Modern”. The taste of each dish was in a word – Sublime!In terms of service, the Head Waiter by the name of Mr. Erik Pravica was assigned to my table. As each course was served, he provided succinct narration for each of the traditional & modern dishes, including details of the ingredients and method of preparation. This resulted in a heightened appreciation for the level of culinary skills that had gone into the dishes. I found myself admiring each dish for a whole minute & taking photos of them before (very slowly and deliberately) consuming the fine work of art. My highest compliments to the Chef De Cuisine, the famed Armin Leitgeb.The restaurant ambiance is quiet, cosy and romantic. The spacing between tables is generous, giving diners sufficient privacy, and ease of having uninterrupted conversations.Needless to say, my Valentine was impressed with the entire dining experience. (Note: She is an established image consultant who teaches dining etiquette, and is no stranger to fine dining. She is not easily impressed, especially when expectations are higher than usual for Les Amis). That in itself says a lot about the capability of Les Amis in maintaining its lofty status.Before concluding this review, I wish to elaborate a bit more on the service. From the time I picked up the phone to make an enquiry till I exit the restaurant, the service level is impeccable. My enquiry was taken by Vincent and the reservation was confirmed by Eileen. During my recce of the restaurant, the Assistant Manager, Mr. Khairil Farhan, answered all my questions and reassured me that I have chosen the right venue to commemorate my 20th Valentine’s Day. The reservation had to be secured by credit card. Based on Mr. Farhan’s handling of my case, there was no doubt in my mind that my Valentine’s Day dining experience are in good hands.Just before leaving the restaurant, the Maitre D’ (master of the establishment), Mr. Christian Wild, gave a stalk of rose to my wife and accompanied us out of the restaurant. He took time to chat with us for about 10 minutes, double/triple checking on whether or not we were really happy with the food and service. I assure him that the restaurant had indeed exceeded my expectations; plus, I am satisfied enough to write a good review to share my experience with anyone looking for the best in French fine dining in Singapore

My wife and I went here for a dinner date. This is not a romantic location; lighting is wrong and rather barren. The food was good, expensive, but not remarkable (I have already forgotten what I had). Very long wine list. Conclusion: this is for business lunches to impress clients, if you have an expense account

It was my mom and sister's birthday lunch. For that reason, my grandmother made a special trip up from Malaysia (she uses a wheelchair for long D due to stroke) and I flew back on a 7hr flight from overseas for a 2 day weekend. If you are like me, you would definitely try to make the most of the 48hrs. As food is one of life's pleasures my family enjoys, I had a hard time deciding which culinary venue was fit for a surprise meal. Lunch was chosen at Les Amis (Shaw Centre), I specifically called up few weeks prior and was pleased to hear that, "Mdm, no problem, we are wheelchair-friendly".As usual, traffic from my house to the city was bad, took us abt an 1hr. Then, we spent 30min under the sweltering heat circling around shaw centre trying to find a wheelchair access to the restaurant because there must be one! as they are claimed they are wheelchair friendly. Boy, we were determined to have a good lunch. Fortunately, we gave up early and decided to push the wheelchair along the back road inches away from the honing cars and taxis to find ourselves standing in front of a 4 x 3 flights of steps leading to the restaurant and to be told :- "Mdm, wheelchair ar, no problem, we can carry the wheelchair down the stairs and also up some steps in the restuarant" (geez, you think, indeed, friendly to wheelchair.)- BUT unfortunately, my sister would not be allowed in as she was dressed in a knee-length pants despite a neat wool blazer and a tanned leather covered shoes as it was not "smart casual". (In that case, I believe my ball gown would not do as well.)We were literally speechless and probably appalled. I can't believe that for a pretentious facade, we have to make such unglamorous and painful entry?? Something is seriously wrong here. Firstly, poor management. Be kind and be honest for what you cannot cater, we are perfectly fine if you cannot accomodate wheelchair, we will still patronize your restaurant on another occasion. Secondly, be clear in the dress code and be flexible. To me, a lady in a pants covering the knees is just as good as a lady in a same length skirt as long as it is neat and presentable. And lastly, it is just a weekend lunch, it is not a meal with the Queen!Les Amis should think about what they aspire to be. In an interview, chef René Redzepi of Noma stated that one of the reasons that pushes him to work as hard as he does was that he does not want to disappoint the diners who have travelled from all over the world for his food. And that is someone kind and respectable. Worth a trip off the beaten track. Then again, I realise, these may not be the aims of Les Amis, my apologies.Choosing to book Les Amis over lunch at Iggy's or Andre was a damn foolish decision on my part, it not only ruined our day, my sis and mom's birthday, my grandma and my trip, and our chance for a great meal at other good deserving restaurants

I had a really good meal here; service was impeccable and food was delish but it felt a little overrated and the ambience was not the best.
Enjoyed myself but not sure i'd come back

excellent food, good presentation; nice wine list.
Small place but makes one feel special
if you have 4-5 persons ; get the table hidden away which looks on the kitchen

Once considered Singapore's finest by many. Les Amis has failed to respond to the huge upswing in choice. Wine remains hideously overpriced.

First of all, the location is just off the road where passers by can look directly into the dining room is disconcerting.The service was impeccable and professional and that was good. The food, with so much emphasis on the chef described in the menu just did not translate into a great experience.We had the degustation menu and of course, the food was nice but that was it. For the price of more than $700 for two (including 2 Bruno Paillard champagnes), it fell far short of a memorable experience.Sadly, the high price and even the great service does not justify another visit

Had the 9 course tasting menu and the food was up there among the best (we visit quite a few M-stars during a year). The service and the knowledge as well. However 900 Singapore dollars with only three glasses of wine, we found a bit stiff. If money is not a case, it is highly recommanded

We were recommended Les Amis by a trusted foodie and were not disappointed. Impeccable service from a knowledgeable staff,so rare in Singapore even at the most expensive of restaurants. Les Amis seems to be run with a passion for all that is great about food and wine and not just seeking to attract big spenders and a trendy reputation. Our 5 + courses dinner with a modest bottle of Bordeaux was Sing $750. Comparable to an equivalent London restaurant. All courses were well balanced and perfectly executed. Dessert is normally my least favorite course,however this time the lemon tart (deconstructed) was a highlight. We were later told that the pastry Chef was recently head hunted from Noma....The number 1 restaurant in the world. I would defiantly go again when the wallet is replenished enough. Our best meal in Singapor

Les Amis a ranked 55 of 100 top best restaurant of the world that situated in Singapore is my current tastiest restaurant in my life.The restaurant was located in 1 Scotts Roads, close to the popular street of Orchard Road, so this makes it very convenient to travel, whether you are from Marina Bay Sands or St.Regis hotel might take about 10-15 minutes. It is indeed a french cuisine restaurant with limited variety of foods but worth the flavors of it. The ambience is peaceful at night with modern European decorations. ( We went there at night so we're not sure what will it be like at day ).Let's talk about foods then ppl.For the appetizers I order a foir gras with almond sauce, roasted cherry and small bread. I have to say that this is pretty delicious because of the roasted cherry that make the taste sweets and that match with the taste for gars that is somewhat oily.For the main course I order a wagyu steak with mashed potatoes and white truffles mushroom, again this steak is fabulous if we compare to other french restaurants and steakhouse. And lastly the dessert has to be a chocolate tarts and bars which is the main impact of my Singapore trip that makes me gain 5 kg. !Anyway I really recommend this restaurant although it is costly but it worth for most people ^

At Les Amis you feel that the whole restaurant caters for you. Besides that the menu is superb, the wine list very good and the ambiance set the tone.Luckily that Les Amis does not have Michelin Stars so they do not enter this sometimes crazy competition among houses. Their competition is with themselves to serve each and everyone of the customers better and better each day

This is a brilliant restaurant and I recommend it to anyone who wants a special night with special food. My only quibble is that this could be in Europe or North America, or anywhere - there is nothing Singaporean about this place, at least on the one occasion I was there, which admittedly might mean I got a skewed impression. Anyway I recommend it - food and presentation are both close to flawless

Fab. Went 4 romantic meal on our honeymoon. 4 couses & 2 x glasses good quality wine & 2 x glasses champagne - $ 390 (Â£200). pricey but equivalent to uk 1-2 michelin star. La dolce vita @ mandarin oriental a good option for half the price (but can see where les Amis is worth the money). Excellent
