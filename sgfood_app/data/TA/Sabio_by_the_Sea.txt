Never expect this restaurant still opens around afternoon. They have 1 for 1 tapas promotion. We ordered 4 tapas and 2 drinks and was so affordable at the end. Good ambienceand music with great services!
1
The food did not even have a minimal resemblance to the real Spanish dish. I doubt the Chef has even ever eaten Spanish food. We were all Spanish and we all felt embarrassed. A total disaster. Will never come back.

The staff are always friendly and make you feel comfortable. Kudos to Chris, who was very friendly and made conversation with us.
They remember you and make you feel welcome.

Came for lunch during the lull work week, ambiance is relaxing and comfortable, food was good though portions were a little small, staff were prompt and polite, rather enjoyable
4
Had the Sunday hangover brunch. Food was delicious and the service was good. May be it was Christmas eve and most foreigners(who stay in Sentosa Cove have gone home; it was not crowded. We had a relaxing and enjoyable brunch.
5
Earlier in the year we had a late breakfast/brunch, it was value for money and good quality and service was acceptable too. Would certainly go back
1
We had to leave without eating ... terrible experience ... this is certainly not how it should be run

My wife and I went for the Valentine`s dinner special last night. We had a good table overlooking the marina but right from the start is was apparent that no-one was paying any attention to us. The service wasn`t just bad, it was non existent and I had to constantly go to the counter to ask for our order to be taken and for our dishes to be served. The food was good when it came and even if the order may have been wrong we had been waiting so long we just ate whatever was put down. When I did raise my hand to try and catch the attention of the young staff it was as if I was invisible. Some basic customer service training is much needed. I normally don`t complain but this was almost a strange experience it was so bad

Table for two at 9pm on New Year’s Eve. Restaurant was 25% full. Service was okay but silent - that is to say, 2 of the waiters acknowledged requests and comments by nodding or shaking but didn’t say a word. It felt depressing. Hot Tapas dishes were prepared promptly and tasted a little above average. Portions were just right. 50 minutes after order was placed for our paella dish, we had to chase the waiter to check on the dish and serve it. We were told the order was overlooked, was now being prepared and would need another 15 minutes. As we were hungry, we ordered another tapas dish while we waited. That dish was served and consumed. Waitress then appears to ask if we would still like to have the paella dish so that they can prepare it. Unacceptable! I would never go back again, or recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Made a reservation for two for this place and came down to Sentosa Cove to give it a try. Upon arrival the place was mostly empty, except for maybe two tables with groups from 8-10 people each. It took some time for staff to seat us, even more time to provide us with a menu. When a staff member finally decided to bother to come and take our order, he mentioned it would take more than 30 minutes to get any food. Imagine if there actually was a crowd! This place was quite simply unwilling to honour a table reservation. Terrible service and should be avoided
4
Delicious Spanish tapas with a nice bouncy castle to keep the little one engaged while we enjoyed some nice drinks and lovely food with a view!
4
Everything we ordered was good!! -- from the tapas to the salads and sangrias, great service and environment too
5
Very nice place to bring your pet on a Sunday evening. It wasn't busy and The staff even provided a bowl of water for our dog!
3
relaxing atmosphere by the dock, food is alright but nothing to rave about, service seems under staffed
4
As residents of Sentosa, we dine here often. The croquettes are a must and the white sangria was delicious. Service a little slow, but the food is good so can wait for it!
4
We really enjoyed our late brunch at Sabio. It is in a lovely setting on the marina, with a breeze cooling things down. The food was fantastic, and we would definitely come back to try other dishes. The Spanish Tortilla with Chorizo was amazing, the addition of Chorizo elevated the dish. Everything felt like a better version of the regular style of tapas. The staff were excellent and beyond generous with serving and topping up of food and drinks. Highly recommended
5
Awesome Spanish gastronomical experience with wide spread of tapas, grilled meats and seafood! Personally love the Paella de Pescado so much! The rice is so moist and flavorful loaded with seafood and with crusty brown bottom layer ;P ( top-up S$15 for the Small Paella )
1
It was our first and last time in this restaurant. The quality of ingredients is ok, nothing remarkable - very remotely Spanish, though. Very expensive for brunch experience - a lot of "serious" restaurants offer high end lunches, by Michelin-starred chefs, for the same price. This one isn't worth the visit. Was advertising animations for kids with a magician - which of course never came. Our young kids were frankly disappointed.And I'm afraid I'm not the only one to have bad memories of Sabio By The Sea, as the restaurant was almost empty when we came, lunchtime, on a weekend... (a detail that speaks for itself: bathroom is facing the restaurant entrance and the staff had left the door opened. Not a nice view, for a start. When I went to the bathroom, it was repulsively dirty, no soap, no bin: a very unusual sight in Singapore)
4
On the buzzy, busy quay with fancy yachts in front of you, Sabio has a pleasant ambience (though I much prefer the quieter FOC Sentosa, which has a resort-type feel to it). The food is good, if a bit pricey. The paellas are all quite good, but note that the portions are smaller than what you may be used to. Service, for a change, is excellent
4
The hangover brunch consists of tapas off a menu. The food is good, I'd recommend the meatballs, fried oysters, asparagus, gambas (prawn). The venue faces the marina for the boats with A lot of families and children riding their bikes and scooters up and down the "boardwalk", if I may call it as such. You're able to top up for a free flow for $59++ (don't think it's worth it, how much of alcohol can you actually drink with food) but we got a jug of Sangria for $49 instead. It was terribly diluted with zero kick at all. The orange juice mix was pulpy and the whole mixture was cloudy. The churros were very disappointing as well. Perhaps it was frozen or the oil wasn't hot when frying. It was very crispy on the outside but raw inside. You can literally dig out the raw wet mixture with a knife. Despite us sending it back once, the same thing was sent back to us. All in all, a nice relaxing brunch.
5
Went on a weekday, chilling and cosy atmosphere. One of the dish that have seafoods and rice is very nice :)
4
brunch food was good, and the quay side view great; a relaxing vibe for lounging, though the prices are a little pricey (but as are most establishments on Sentosa), and the staff could be more responsive.
5
Nice food and good atmosphere.
Staff were friendly and managed to surprise my boyfriend with the birthday cake that I pre-arranged with them.
4
Went on Sunday night with family. It was fairly quiet and waiters were friendly and attentive. We ordered seafood paella, tapas and cheese croquettes. The seafood paella was tasty and I was satisfied with the food overall. Value was okay and in line with what I'd expect
4
We went with Trepidation having read mainly negative reviews of this place but the lure of seafront dining(located at Quayside Isle Sentosa Cove) was just too strong to resist ......Upon arrival just before 7 pm we were the only guests but the passionate serving by assistant manager Harridas and May soon put us at ease . We order the All U Can Eat @$49.90 menu which consisted of cold & hot tapas selections and mains . We found the portions of the tapas rather generous as compared to other tapas outlets here and even those in Madrid & Barcelona ! Outstanding tapas were Almejas al Ajillo(clams in garlic sauce) , Ostras Fritas (Fried Oysters) Pulpo con Sofrito .Over all we found the hot tapas much more palatable than the cold tapas but we filled ourselves with too much cold tapas as we started with cold and had little space left to enjoy the hot tapas and the mains but this is purely personal preference . We were glad we made a great choice coming here to enjoy this wonderful tapas experience and it didn't cause a big dent in our pockets 
4
The food was excellent. The staff were attentive and were fast in their service. The children's easter programme was excellent. A special thanks to Hari for entertaining and going all out for the kids. We waited quite some time for the dishes. It was a bit slow but overall we had a good time 
1
We booked a table for the Easter brunch. After almost 3hours we didn't receive half of the tapas/grills we ordered and they explained us that "it was a busy day for the kitchen"...of course it was, that is why people book so they can be prepared
2
One of the worst brunches I have ever had in singapore.....their duxton branch is a lot more efficient.Baring in mind this is a tapas bar....with nothing pre prepared. A cheese platter taking 45 minutes to arrive and only receiving 60% percent of orders and then none of the ones we hadnt revieved being followed up - instead ignored by staff.On top of that particular staff members dressing like they have been working on a ship yard and absolutely stank.One lady who was our saving grace ensured we had plenty to drink, because of her we didn't walk out...but what a disappointment. Never coming back here
2
We are regulars at the original Sabio & have always had a great time there. This time wedecided to give this a try & boy were we in for a terrible evening!first of all it took nearly 10 minutes to catch the eye of one of the young waitresses (though they had less than 50% occupancy. When we gave our order we were surprised to find she did not take it down at all, just repeated it to us, but ok if that's they way its done who are we to question. She did tell us the paella would take 30-40 minutes. The rest of the order came pretty quickly, within about 10 -15 minutes & was disappointing to say the least. The squid & the octopus were both rubbery & seemed like they had been reheated in the microwave, (had both several times at Sabio at Duxton & they do them beautifully),)the gambas was well cooked but lacked seasoning. Well, we still had our hopes up for the paella we knew not to expect the paella for a while, but when nearly an hour had gone by with no sign of the paella,my husband managed (after much difficulty) to catch the eye of the one waitress who was around. She looked blankly when we asked for our Paella then said she would check with the kitchen only to come back 5 minutes later to tell us the order had never been placed & if we did want it it would be another hour!At this poin we cancelled it paid our bill & decided to write off the whole evening

Having heard great things about the set brunch at Sabio we were very excited for our visit. Sadly it did not live up to expectations. We were the only group in there and there was very little atmosphere. The music was very intermittent, kept cutting out and then playing over and over. When we asked if it could be turned off the waiter just laughed and said "yeah it does that". The food was very underwhelming, especially the pork. Potions were tiny too. We won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend.
4
A very pleasant tapas lunch along the cove. The staff were very welcoming and the food was well presented. The sangria was delightful!
4
I love the food served in the restaurant, personally just feel that the staff should take more effort to walk around and check instead of sitting there and waiting to be called
4
It's was a really good experience. Good food good atmosphere and very friendly staff. My hubby and I had enjoyed ourselves very much.
3
They were short of staff.
Tried to order an iced black coffee but they said they didn't have. Which is weird because they served ice latte, ice mocha and all.
5
We visited there after I had a great meal on my anniversary
We decided to head back to have their wonderful pork belly and such，
Have to say it's always so good
4
Great hangout for parents waiting for kids to finish. We went for the eat-all-you-can option and enjoyed every dish.

As we were staying on Sentosa, we decided to try Sabio, a tapas restaurant nearby as we really enjoy the variety of a shared tapas meal. Unfortunately the meal was generally very disappointing and very expensive, for what was served. There were few people dining yet service was extremely slow. We ordered a glass of wine and one Bloody Mary but nothing appeared until after the first tapas dishes arrived and later, although we had finished our drinks, no one asked if we would like another.The quality of the dishes was very uneven and they weren't all awful. The roasted potatoes were hot and crispy, though not exactly real patatas bravas and my roasted vegetables were OK. The ham croquets had plenty of ham in them but the binding mixture seemed to be a gluggy roux which was not very pleasant. The tomato bread was all right and there was plenty of it but the cold gazpacho was horrible. It was the colour of tinned tomato soup and tasted vinegary with none of the garlicky and cucumber flavours of good gazpacho. But the worst dish was the lamb "cutlets". They were 3 totally untrimmed chops with thick layers of fat and hardly any meat. We left them.The saving grace was the very good churros but they hardly made up for a very disappointing meal. I have family living on Sentosa, near Sabio, but they won't be going back
1
The attitude of the wait staff could be better improved. No one called to confirm my reservation. Upon arrival, I informed them that I had a reservation but the wait staff gave me a blur look.No recommendations on food or drink was given.Wait staff was chit chatting amongst themselves and I had to wait for some time before they noticed that I was waving at them to ask for the bill
2
We reserved a table which was clearly not necessary as there was only 3 tables in a huge restaurant. Why only a 2 star rating? Well, it started with the service. Very slow, almost non existent. The tapas we had was very tasty but after eating we eventually had to call the waiters over to clear the table. They were all standing inside having something to drink talking about the sign they just wrote up and forgetting about the people that is sitting outside with a table full of dirty dishes. We ended up leaving and moved on to a different restaurant for dinner. Won't go bac
4
Pleasant overall experience, ambience was great view was good. Service was sub-par as restaurant was packed and they seemed understaffed as service took a while. We had no food served for a good 30mins. When the bill came, the ink on receipt was so pale there was no legible word and we had to squint to make out the figures. It was as good as serving a blank piece of paper as receipt. Server was exceptional hostile and defensive about it, he said bluntly 'I can read it for you' x3 with a 'i refuse to do anything, i cant do anything, i am not apologetic, shut up and pay up' attitude.A much more polite waiter came by and we asked the same question and he apologised and said they had issues with the printer. which was lovely and totally understandable. Will still recommend thi

Its was a greet dinner at Sabio with my colleagues on a Friday night. And we enjoyed the food very much. We will definitely go there again.
5
My cousins took me here for dinner and I loved the ambiance of the area and view. Its overlooking the water, its perfect for a cozy, private dining experience with your loved ones or family. Service was good and the waitress explained well.
5
I have eaten in this restaurant on many occasions over the past few years. It has a relaxed atmosphere by the Sentosa Marina and is open almost everyday.The great thing about this restaurant, apart from the fresh, delicious hot and cold tapas, is you can bring your dogs and sit outside.The menu has a lot of variety, but my typical favourites are Ham Croquettas, Tomato Bread and Jamon and the Grilled Prawns with miso mayonnaise.If you are at Quayside isle, not to be missed. Oh and when it rains, the sangria is a necessity to get through lunch
4
Pretty cool place to dine, even for lunch. Can't go wrong with a jug of sangria and paella to fill your stomach. Be informed though, paella takes half an hour to prepare which indicates it's cooked properly. Service was good, and the patatas alioli was good
1
Group of 5 of us went on a Monday night to celebrate a birthday dinner. Worst ever:1. Anchovies with olives on bread - way too much olives, can't even taste the anchovy.2. Clams in white sauce wasn't salty enough3. Paella was burnt at the bottom, a thick layer of pure black burnt rice. It was also tasteless.4. Virgin mojito was so so bad, so bitter despite stirring non-stop only to find after that all the sugar crystals were at the bottom. If they weren't going to mix it properly at least give a damn stirrer.5. White wine sangria was just... blah. Poor. Drank a sip n regretted ordering it.The frustrating part is that the food and drinks are expensive and you'd expect SOME kind of quality in the food and service, but these were so poor and utterly below standards for what you pay for. We complained about the paella and we were offered a poor justification by the Chef that "it's a charcoal stove and hence the heat can't be controlled... but others have ordered it and no one else complained." The restaurant was really empty and we wondered if the Chef was really so busy he had to convey that through the waitress. We were seated outside the kitchen and could see them inside standing around chewing. Hmm.Bottom line - spend your money elsewhere. When without charging us for the paella and a 15% off the dinner came up to almost $40/head.
2
We used to come to Sabio by the sea and at Duxton hill alot because of the great food, good service and nice atmosphere, but unfortunately the food is nothing like it used to be and one reason is probably they stopped serving their tapas in small hot pans and instead serves it in regular bowls in which the dishes are served lukewarm and is soon cold. Only good thing is the service remain good
3
The place is just so-so...if you're coming with a group of friends, better to take the all you can eat option so that at least you maximize the tapas. It's not bad but it's not amazing other. Desserts are nice though so it more than made up for some of the average tasting tapas.
4
Well.... If you wanna impress your date, then taking her on a date by the quayside is certainly a way to do it. And to dine by the sea with the yachts will certainly do the trick.So head on down to Sabio and lets its' wonderful staffs help make your night memorable.The food served is good especially the lamb shanks and chicken cooked with garlic. Gambas all pil pil, Seafood Paslla, mushrooms and Spanish omelet are not too bad only thing is it may have been adjusted to suit the local taste. However, overall experience is still there and appreciate the friendliness of the staffs
5
Was at Sabio with my family. Perfect place for a relaxing and private evening. Food was good as usual, though serving size were smaller than expected. What stands out for our night was the excellent & personalised service rendered to us. Tip-top service level experienced to complete our visit to Sabio. Awesome job Yussof @ Sabio by the Sea !
1
We have been to Sabio twice. First time we had a terrible experience in terms of food and service. However, as it had good review and the setting is amazing we decided to give it another try. Again the service was appalling and the food awful and definitely not like anything you would try in spain. The quality of the produce id bad and the cooking is not like anything you would try in Spain. I am not sure who is cooking and what they are cooking but they should reassess what they are doing and who they are cooking for. As I say the setting is beautiful and they could do a much better job. The service is bad because both times we have been, they are so understaffed the personnel cannot cope, they are stressed and don't work properly. The only decent member of staff was a lovely french lady who worked so hard and so professionally to try to fix everyone's shortcomings that I doubt she will stay working at Sabio for much longer. If she does, she certainly deserves a medal. I think whoever runs this restaurant needs to rethink the whole thing. I saddens me to give a bad review bit it may be the only way this beautiful restaurant in such a great spot changes their way. The clientele is not Spanish like in other Spanish restaurants in singapore and will never be while the maintain the way they interpret Spanish cuisine
3
Good food. Service was lacking and very slow. The churros didn't come for a long time so we gave up and left
4
This Resto has a beautiful view, we can see a lot of yachts in front of this Resto. Good place for relax with your families. Food is delicious, especially The Tuna Steak & Paella. Good service. You May Consider When You In Singapore.
3
As usual in Singapore, a pleasant ambience and good food is lost in the myriad of inattentive staff, slow service and a general lack of interest in 'doing a good job'.
1
Took our order but served the drinks some how missed the food. Had to remind and remind and waited 50 mins for food. Food is average at best
3
Located at Sentosa Cove. It could be further improved. The tapas was just ok. Paellas were delicious. Staff needed further training.
Better go in the evening or night. Nicer view.
1
Food ok. Nothing special for the price at all. Had to wait until our meal was finished before the drinks even arrived. Even though we asked the waiter twice about them. Then after asking for the bill twice, it arrived almost forty minutes later. When I brought it up with the staff, and who I presume was the manager, they just smiled and laughed. No apology or comp on the drinks ( 1 jim beam and 1 sangria that took an hour) or anythingJust disgusting. DO NOT GO!!!!! The restaurant was empty besides from a table of 1, a table of about 12 and myself and my husband. There were 4+ staff members on duty. JUST DISGUSTING!!
4
We went on a Saturday night when the restaurant was full and the management were apparently under prepared for the amount of people who would come along for the 'all you can eat tapas for $50' deal. The staff tried very hard, and did all that they could. They smiled in between running from one table to another and were always friendly. I wish the management would give them a little help and hire more though, seems from other comments that this is a common occurance! The food was delicious, great selection of tapas even on the 'all you can eat' menu. If you're relaxed and not in a rush, I'd recommend this place. I"ve also been for brunch and their breakfast deal in great value, and also yummy
1
Our reservation was for 8pm, we ordered reasonably quickly but it was still 840pm before we were even given a glass of water. Our first dish came at 920pm, 3 chopped up mushrooms between 4 adults, by 940pm we have our second sharing dish, a salad. At this point we had had enough and asked for the manager. We told them that unless we had some food within 5 minutes we were leaving, the manager appeared pretty useless but, at this point a lady, we assumed to be the owner, turned up. We told her the problem and she organised for some quick dishes, the food was good but we will never go back

All restaurants at Quayside Isle of course benefit from the relaxing, laidback "life-feels-good" vibe of being surrounded by bobbing yachts and posh housing that is Sentosa Cove. We come to Sabio by the Sea off and on, because you get tapas and paella al fresco, and the kids can run around on the deck. The food is generally good, not great nor refined, but perfect for casual dining. Favourites are the Pulpo, croquetas de jamon and chorizo picante. The paellas are decent, nothing to shout about though. We found service to be actually quite friendly all of the times we visited, despite the negative reviews here. We do, however, have to agree wholeheartedly that it is expensive - dining around the same kind of restaurants in Singapore, we are almost always taken aback by the bill here in Sabio. Like I mentioned earlier, it is after all casual dining. And that would be our only real negative comment here
5
The very first thing we noticed when we were sat down was their exceptional friendly service. Recommendations were offered and the food was quite up to expectation. The dessert we had was to die for, the Salted Caramel Lava Cake.. OMG max!! We will definitely return just for that.
5
The flavours of the food were excellent and loved the seaside setting. Lovely experience. Music was terrible though. Something they should consider improving.
5
We had a nice dinner on the marina with a selection of tapas to share for the family. Very good food, although a little pricey if you are hungry like we were
2
Food is below par. Every dish ordered lacked a dash of salt.
Grill items looks stale. By far one of the least pleasant Spanish tapa place around.
1
Stay away if you come with a family .. Terrible food, no kids menu , awful burgers ( brought from the Restaurant next to it!!!!). Never come here.. Total dissapointent !!!! Beware of it !!!
3
Restaurant is located at nice place which is accessed only by own transport or by cab
Food was average and service was good
Don't think I will go back to this place
4
We enjoyed the food at Sabio. It was quiet on a weekday evening and the service staff were very attentive. They were able to explain when we asked them more about the food. The food was served quickly and they were delicious. Portion is expected.
2
Wine list is mostly better for paint removal or other industrial jobs. Food is OK. Service is dazed and confused. Go to Saint Pierre instead a few doors down....way better!
4
Sabio is an excellent eating place for Spanish food. Nicely located in Quayside Isle . Grilled chicken was out of the world. Octopus is a must have
4
A very pleasant tapas restaurant, providing excellent and tasty dishes with a distinct taste of Spain. A slight reservation would be the size of the portions, especially the chorizo in wine, but it was good quality food and we had plenty to eat. The restaurant is positioned in the stunning marina of Sentosa Cove which is a stylish development containing a number of good dining choices overlooking rows of luxuriously appointed gin palaces. Attentive service
3
The decor of the restaurant is very chic and is located inside Sentosa cove facing the marina. It is very romantic and laid back. Service is very good but the food has always been a bit disappointing. We live nearby so we went there for a few times hoping it could become better but it was still a disappointment. Some dishes are better than other but most of the time when we were there, half of them were either too oily Or drowned with sauces. We have decided not to go there anymore as it is also not worth paying substandard food for such a high price
3
Wonderful location and view. Very friendly staff. Delicious tapas. Average sangria. ( actually avoidable) and too much saffron in paella. But good for family or friends dinner.
3
Went to eat here for my birthday dinner. The variety is nice but the food is good. We had simple tapas and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.
4
We were here for our weekday date night. Seated by the marina at sunset. Authentic and yummy Spanish food. Try their Sangria with your hot tapas!
5
Brought my Thai and Singaporean friends to Sabio by the Sea and we had a good time. The beer bucket was value for money which the guys loved. The waiter who was a little reserved at first grew on me after he gave me good and honest food suggestions. It wasn't my first time there but it was my first time making the order and I especially did not want to disappoint my friends from overseas. Hence, I truly appreciated his truthful recommendations. Food is yummy but the one I always look forward to is the churros. It's located at Quayside Isle, so you not only get to have a beautiful view of the marina and boats, and soak in the laid-back atmosphere, but also have many options for food. I have had full meals at Sabio by the Sea, and also dinner at another restaurant and finish off the night with churros and drinks at Sabio by the Sea
3
My sister & husband brought my mum and I to this restaurant we left them to order the tapas and we ordered sangria to drink , the sangria was okay , the food itself was yummy and tastey we had paella , olives , potatoes with aioli , and a few other dishes and have to say the food was yummy portions were just right , as there was some boating show going on the restaurant had a great vibe about it and our table looked out onto the boats for dessert we had coffee and churros which was soooooo good the whole meal was pleasant and the food ordered was just enough for all 4 of us , would reccomend it to all that love tapas 
4
Found the tapas to be of good quality but a bit uninspiring. Nothing that stood out as exciting or something unusual. Had the Serrano ham, sandwiches, meatballs, gazpacho, mussels, churros and a couple of more dishes that I can't remember. The service from the guy working there was however great as he accommodated us and offered plenty of suggestions on how to make our visit more enjoyable. Unfortunately I didn't get his name but he was wearing specs if I remember correctly
5
First of all the view of he marina with the beautiful yatch and sailing boat is so relaxing. Come to the food, it is a real spanish fare. You can do the whole meal with the large selection of tapas.Cold and hot.Service is really good. A great place for great fun. Looking at the world pass bye.So good i am going again next week.
2
I understand that the rent must be super high at sentosa cove, and yet the food offerings they have at Sabio are seriously way too overpriced. The portions for the tapas are very small, and yet super expensive. In addition, the food was generally too oily. Having been to Spain before, the food here was a mere shadow of the authentic stuff in Spain
2
Oh dear, what a disappointment. Went here for a late lunch on a Saturday. Service was terrible and food the was burnt and tasteless. We had potatoes and they were so burnt, tomato bread was ok, but kind of tasteless, the sauce around the meatballs was nice, but the meatball itself was terrible, I wouldn't have fed it to my dog. Poor quality meat obviously over processed in a food processor. Really was not happy about paying for this one - what a waste of money and time
3
We came because we were staying on Sentosa Island and thought it would be a perfect atmosphere to eat by the cove. However the place was a bit empty and therefore it just felt old as opposed to a nice atmosphere. Sadly the food was average and maybe a tad oily. It is decent Spannish food but we get the same sort of food at our neighbourhood diner at maybe lower prices. So this place wouldn't be worth a special visit. Sangria was too diluted. Churrios was delicious
2
The marina is a fantastic place to be in the evening. And it obviously costs the proprietors a lot of money to be there. Because they don't give you much.Supposed to be a tapas bar - but if their tapas is much smaller than their main courses then you won't get much at all.Had the large paella which is stated to be for 3-4 people. Not a chance. It was so small we thought it was for an individual.As a group of Europeans who have all drunk sangria in Spain we know what to expect but the diluted red wine we got wasn't really up to much.But the Hoegarden beer came in genuine glasses.It looks the part but bits are lacking or missing. Which you have to say is normal for any attempts at European experiences here in Singapore
3
I wouldn't like to comment on the authenticity of the tapas as it's been 10 years since I've been to Spain, but let's talk about the tastes and flavours. Sadly this was not always consistent. The albondigas was very good. The Spanish omelette looked perfect but didn't taste of much. Everything else was so-so. Garlic haters beware ... There is a lot of it everywhere and that's coming from a garlic lover! Not really worth the money we paid. Catalunya charges similar and you get better quality.Contrary to the other reviewers, we had a waiter who was pleasant and attentive. And of course, it's nice and quiet by the marina at night. Sentosa Cove is a great location
4
We went there as a group of 12 over the weekend with kids and all. The place was not very packed and we liked the fact that they prepared a longish table to fit all of us. There were lots of choices in the menu and so we ordered the following: scallops in white wine, prawns in olive oil & garlic, grilled lamb cutlet, Jamon Iberico, Chorizo iberico, clams in white wine, chicken in garlic, corquettes, meat balls, fried potato, beef cutlets etc. We had a jug of sangria to go along with the meal.Overall, the food was good and ambience great as the place was just overlooking the sea with the fancy boats all around. The scallops are good and so were the clams. Service could be better as it takes a while to get the service staff's attention somehow. There was no breeze coming from the sea so it felt rather warm as we sat out in the open. I would go back again just for the ambience as one can also enjoy a walk down the quayside after the meal

We had brunch here recently upon the recommendation of friends. We had their brunch of the day and churros and chocolate for my daughter. The spanish omelette with the brunch was so-so and the serving portion smallish. But the churros were very good. Good coffee as well

Walked by this place a couple of times while staying at the W at Sentosa Cove and decided to check it out for dinner one night. We had the Spicy Olives, Grilled Asparagus with Serrano Ham, Ensalada de Pincho Moruno de Pollo, and Paella Negra (Mixed Seafood In Black Ink Squid). The food was delicious, and price was very reasonable (about US$100 for everything, including 2 glasses of wine).I would have given it a 5 star, except that the first server who seated us barely gave us any attention, and left us to stew for about 10 minutes, waiting, waiting, waiting. All this time, the restaurant was about half empty, so not sure what she did after seating us.I had to get up and flag another person (who looked like a manager) to take our orders. She was deeply apologetic, but unfortunately, first impressions were already made.So go for the ambiance, the view, and the food. The service… not so much
4
We came in late, so the kitchen was already about to close in 5 minutes. We ordered the churros with the chocolate dip. It was amazing. Portions served were just about right. Service could be improved, considering that we were the last table and the restaurant only had 4 remaining tables excluding us. Overall, food was great, ambience by the harbour was spectacular, service could use some improvements

I loved the food at Sabio by the Sea. We ordered the Chorizo Omelet and the Clams in White Wine Sauce to start and were not disappointed. We then had main courses of Pork Shoulder and Steak that were just as wonderful with a great Spanish flavor. Like most of the reviewers I did feel the service could have been better but I also felt they were a bit understaffed. Perhaps the addition of a few more wait staff would solve that problem. I think though that overall my experience was a good one and I would definitely go again

Myself and my fiancé took colleagues from work to dinner at Saint Pierre as we recently moved to Sentosa and had colleagues to our home first for drinks and then headed to the Quayside for dinner. The wine suggestions were delicious and we had two gorgeous bottles and fantastic meals. The views were lovely and it was nice that the restaurant was indoors but still had gorgeous harbour views. We will most certainly we back :

I visited there on 28 Jul with my family. When I asked for a table for three, manager seemed to be very reluctant to give us a table telling me that waiting time would be around 1 hour. But I saw many empty tables. Also, waitrese were so busy in doing something so that we were unattended more thab 30 min without giving us any hint when food will be ready. Nobody said sorry for this situation, and they do not know how to say sorry to the customers. Even worse, food is very salt

Wanted to bring my husband to sabio for brunch. I made a online reservation on Monday via hungry go where app. Even received the reservation confirmation. But to play safe, on Tuesday I called up the restaurant just to make sure that they received my reservation. Everything went well, a lady answered and confirm my reservation for '2 pax at 11am.'Upon arrival on Wednesday, the manager (I'm guessing he is the manager by the way he spoke) told me that the restaurant only opens at 12pm. I explain to him that I made an online reservation and even called to confirm my reservation and all was well! His responds to me was 'the app got problem one. And the staff you spoke to might be new, she don't know' How am I suppose to react to this?! I know I did not check the opening hours on my own, but I even called the next day to confirm my reservation. So a new staff is not expected to know of the restaurant's opening hours?! We did not bother waiting. We left. Bad bad impression.
4
Very good tapas but lacking in service. The people there seemed very busy and it takes awhile to get their attention. The food came surprisingly fast and we did truly enjoyed it.

Nice place for lunching. Opens daily. If you want to impress and have all the restaurant by yourself, go there for lunch. Tried the Rose wine , la Carne, El Cerdo, Pescado Cocido, Churros Caramel.

We booked this restaurant for lunch on Sat 14th July 2014 as part of the Palate membership. However when we arrived we were told that we could not enjoy our usual discount because it was the eve of a public holiday. As much as I racked my brain I couldn't for the life of me think of any significant worldly event occurring on Sun 15th June - and I was pretty sure no one had decided to move Xmas to halfway down the calendar so I asked and they helpfully replied, "Singapore's Father's Day". As much as I respect the Fathers of this world this is hardly a significant event and considering we arrived the day before this inconsequential event I did not agree that we should not have enjoyed our discount.The place was empty anyhow so we left and went to Picotin which was packed, with welcoming wait staff and served excellent food as always
1
First off, they served us cold iberian ham. When asked they insisted it was under "cold tapas" when it wasn't. Neither have I ever eaten cold iberian ham anywhere else (Spain or singapore). Food was just as bad with both prawns and scallops tasting stale and frozen. Bread tasted like it was 5 months old and dry. Service was nothing to brag about.
3
Went to Sabio for dinner while visiting family in March. Food was good but not fantastic. Prices were ok but wouldn't say great value. Having spent time in Spain and sampling lots of tapas, although not disappointing There is room for improvement. Nice location but service wasn't the best

Quayside isle is a great new addition to Singapore...with tonnes of restaurants near a beautiful marina. Sabio by the Sea has a very cool authentic Spanish vibe while still appealing to the local market. The paintings on the wall are reminiscent of Miro and it is all open to the outdoors. The food was delicious, but a little pricey. We spent $150 for a family of 4 and one tapa was offered by the restaurant. We were going to have the brunch, but if you are not a pork or egg fan, the choices are limited. The gaspacho was lovely, served in a champagne flute and the patatas with aioli were beautifully encrusted with a hit of smoked paprika (if I detected correctely). Churros are hard to replicate in Singapore because of the climate, but I wondered if I weren't a little disappointed in them because of the oil they were fried in as well. The house dessert is not Spanish, but a creative take on molten lava cake with a more Latin American influence: caramel. From the pictures on the website I was expecting a more impressive size, but the fact that it is so delicious makes up quickly for the deception. The open-faced toasted bread with manchego, cheese and ham was perfect for one of the kids. The scallops could have used a little more colour, and the chicken in the orange salad was more to local tastes than Spanish, so my child was not too enamored with it, but overall we were pleased

Situated 10 minutes walk from my sisters apartment we had stopped by one afternoon for a drink, liked the look of the menu so booked in for the Saturday night. When we got there, there were a few tables free so we had our pick and chose to sit on the chairs (more casual) than at a table. We ordered a round of drinks and a selection of dishes. I've read a few of the reviews ref it not being a 'tapas' bar... not sure i would agree with that. The choice of dishes represent the majority of tapas dishes you would get in Spain - obviously we are not in Spain but in Singapore. All the dishes we had: parma ham, spanish omlette, prawns... to name a few were very nice and tasty. The only problem is the service which can be quite long. We were not in a rush so it didn't bother us too much but i can see where some people are coming from by mentioning this in other reviews. There are a few other restaurants around the marina that i would try before coming back here but it depends on what you are looking for... The meal was quite expensive especially when you start taking quite a few different dishes!! ;-

I was looking to organize a nice quiet dinner by the waterfront for my boyfriend's birthday. A friend recommended Sabio by the Sea and I thought it would be perfect to have tapas with some Iberico ham which was one of our favorites. The place was very much out of the way so I thought it should be good... But it fell short in every possible way. I made the reservation two days before through the internet with a note that it was for a birthday and to reserve us a good table with a view. Also I wanted them to prepare a desert for the birthday boy with no or less sugar since he is diabetic. When we got there, no table, no specially prepared dessert. Worse, it seemed that that was the first time they looked at the reservation note. The waiter gave us a so-so table with uncomfortable chairs and when we asked to move to another section with a better table they said it was closed. (Later in the night, that section miraculously "opened" for other diners) They served us bread but only a serving of three for 4 persons. When we raised this with the waiter he merely sniffed and said that's how they serve their portions. So we paid extra for more bread. Then came the meal... Admittedly the non-restaurant made food was good, meaning those that were imported in-- like the ham and chorizo but that has little to do with their abilities. However, the ones that came from their kitchen was another story. From the calamari, to the octopus, and other forgettable dishes-- the food was so bland. Nothing at all like real flavorful Spanish tapas. We had to season them at the table ourselves. At the end of the meal had to settle with an uber sweet lava cake just so that my boyfriend can blow out a candle-- which he couldn't eat. And when we got the bill even after all those inconveniences they did not even think to waive the cost of the cake as a bday treat. To sum up, it's not all that accessible, the ambience isn't that great, and neither is the food, and the staff are not accommodating and don't know the meaning of the word "service"-- as I said in the title, give it a miss
3
This restaurant is anything but true Spanish. The pan con tomate and Pulpo a la Gallega were very far fetched interpretations of Spanish classic. Rest of the food was not original as well. If you want authentic Spanish food, don't come here. Service is slow and waiters are not knowledgeable on the food (kind of a Singapore standard these days)Ambiance is very nice next to the marina, but fit out and furniture are cheaply done. Be careful with the deck chairs, they look comfy but are Chinese knock-offs and nearly fell apart when I sat on them.To sum it up: better save your money and eat somewhere else
4
Came here for a lunch on a whim, they had just opened for the day and there were no other patrons. Had a good selection of their tapas dishes (probably 8 or so dishes between the 2 of us) and left feeling satisfied. Some dishes could have been better, but overall I enjoyed the food
5
Great place for a relaxing afternoon with friends. Both food and service was good. The squid leg and the salads are highly recommended.
3
Very relaxing... Good food...
ideal for relaxing lazy late breakfast. Service staff is okay... not so fantastic.. but the ambiance it fantastic you don't have to bother the service.
Will I come back? Maybe.
5
Can't say its "the best Spanish food ever" but very good value and taste. Everyone really enjoyed authentic Spanish meal.
3
We wanted to see what all the hype was about and got an early dinner table. The jamon and chorizos were good but but the paella was bland. When we asked for a few condiments to accentuate the flavor the waiters never delivered. Not only was the long wait a meal spoiler but the lack of respect for customers - not even a simple, "Sorry we forgot!" - made this dinner an irritation instead of an experience. Stick to the original
5
We came for tapas and tapas we got! We ate them all night.....and there was certainly enough variety on the menu for that.....Our server had a sense of humour and looked after us well....the heat on the patio often matched the heat on our tongues, a smashing combo that revved up even more the funky, fun atmosphere of the place.....will be back for sure
2
My friends and i (four of us) dined at this Tapas place at Sentosa Cove. Menu was ok, nothing great. My friend asked for olive oil when the bread came. It never came. The paella was quite bland so my other friend asked for salt... three times. It never came as well.With food that was just so-so, and with a wait-staff who are either forgetful or just don't care, honestly, it's not worth a second visit
4
The location on the marina at Sentosa is excellent. To add to it the food was very good. We ordered the seafood paella which was v good. The meat balls with tomato sauce was excellent & so was the grilled chicken with cheese. As expected the drinks were pricy but that is usually the case. Overall strongly recommend especially for family as there is space for the kids to run around & for the adults to chat & enjoy the meal & company
4
The ambience of Sentosa cove is like watching a live ad for great living in Singapore. People running with their dogs, parents taking walks with their happy kids, desperate house wives lookalikes sipping wine during evening gossip sessions. whahahahaha... Good traditional tapas & service was very good. Think the ambience sitting by the water and watching a "live ad" takes the prize! ;
5
I have tried a couple of tapas restaurants such as serenity, don quixote and Sabio. Sabio emerges as the winner. Simple dish such as garlic mushroom were done in perfection. I think they used a lot of garlic, parsley and white wine. Which the other Spanish restaurants failed to achieve. I love the vibes there as the restaurant is open concept kind opening out to the view of yatch, it makes you feel relax.

Sabio By The Sea is located in Quayside Isle in Sentosa. A lovely spot for people watching and well, boat watching.It was my mate's birthday and we decided to give SBTS a go. When we walked in, we were greeted with an array of horse's heads on the wall and white antler chandeliers. We were assured both were not real and we were indeed in a Spanish tapas restaurant. Okay...The list of food available on the Josper Grill was impressive so we thought we'd have some of that as well as some from the 'usual' menu. We ordered El Pulpo (grilled octopus leg served with viola mash), La Medula (grilled bone marrow served with toasted baguette), Chachouka + Grilled Anchovies Filet, Fideua (paella noodles with squid ink, prawn and sea bass), Calamres a la plancha (pan-fried calamari), Chorizo al vino (spicy sausage pan fried in red wine), Bacalao al ajo arniero (salt cod with red capsicum) and, jamon Iberica.And for desserts, their Signature Salty Butter Caramel Lava Cake, Churros and Pina asada (roasted marinated pineapple served with vanilla ice cream). The birthday boy had a white sangria which was met with a thumbs-down, while his wife had a mojito which had the opposite reaction. Us 2 decided to skip that and ordered 2 bottles of red. A tad expensive I thought though admittedly they were delicious. It seemed like a lot of food for 4 people. But in reality it was enough as the servings straddled between appetizer and mains portions.The service cannot be faulted, the service staff that served us were friendly and professional. The setting was immaculate.However it must be added that the price was a tad high even without the wine. But more importantly, while the food was good it wasn't mind blowing. The 2 friends who just came back from Barcelona weren't impressed one bit. For me, who have yet to set foot there, I thought the food at SBTS was decent but could be better

Loved the location, was with s couple of families with all the space outside, kids had fun. Food was great , specially the chicken,and the chorizos.paella was missing a little something, but would love to come back again.
3
Octopus leg with mash was excellent! Iberico ham n hot chorizo was good too. Razor clam was a dissapointment...rubbery....caramel lava cake was almost perfect if only the ice cream was not a super tiny scoop.

We went there in a big group on a weekday for lunch. It was so ldyllic and the food was great!

Well designed place - great prints, antler chandeliers, etc. We went on a Monday afternoon - so there were very few other guests. Effectively the service was great (even though they seemed to have just one waiter). Food was fine (not a cheap place), but what made it a brilliant place was the amazing setting. Sunny day, blue skies, pier, all those yachts bobbing on the water - all made it a brilliant experience. Next time though, I'd want to check out the many other places on the pier

We chose to go there on Sunday, 8th December. All I can say is that it was DISAPPOINTING!!! The waiter who took our orders didn't even take the order properly. We ordered the tapas, and we were looking forward to something amazing but the sardines in tomato sauce were a rip off. At SGD 14 for a dish that the 'chef' clearly prepared by using a can opener!! The meatballs, the manchego croquettes and lamb chop was delicious. The serve staff were not attentive at all and service was very very poor! We definitely won't be going back there again

We have just returned from a disastrous visit to this Tapas Bar ! The service was shocking ! Firstly we ordered 3 tapas dishes , only two arrived one of which was the wrong dish.We then ordered chicken Paella which incidentally says on the menu requires 25 minutes cooking time.  ...... It never arrived! Despite the waitress telling us when asked where it was .... Only another 4 mins ! ... Truth was the order was never conveyed to the kitchen! To rectify the matter we were offered someone else's paella! ... Which was seafood! .... Beggars belief !!Throughout this fiasco no staff came near us to ask if we would like more drinks. Our glasses were empty ... Drinks were very slow in coming .Extremely bad service . With staff who could'nt care less
4
the iberian ham (fed on acorns) was good and authentic - the same way it tastes in Hispania. the tapas is good. the serivce could be a bit better. the paella was a bit too sweet for me but it was not bad - it actually serves non-seafood paella and that can be an attraction for people who are allergic to seafood (like my wife). if the weather permits and you can sit outside then the views can be good....

I was delighted to discover Sentosa Cove recently with a colleague for lunch to escape from the boring choices at Harbourfront. Disappointingly many of the restaurants don't open for lunch but Sabio looked appealing with its outside area overlooking the marina and set lunch options. My expectations for tapas in Singapore aren't high generally - unless it's Jason Atherton's Esquina or similar. So I avoided the main tapas menu on this occasion and went with the set. Overall I was quite happy with the meal. To start we had cold cuts - a generous portion with bread followed by tartine for me and some sandwiches for my colleague (ham, manchego cheese and one other). There were a few other choices for main but nothing that jumped out at me particularly. I'm not usually a fan of dessert but the churros rounded off the meal very well. All for $22 ++. Also included a soft drink. Service was quite slow, no idea how they would cope if it was actually busy (there were 3 tables when we were there) but friendly all the same
4
Very simply the best tapas in Singapore for the price and a great location. Also very authentic compared to some of the imitation tapas out there. My only complaint is that while the manager is clearly making an effort to provide good service, the staff could profit from some better training and oversight. Nevertheless, a great place for a long weekend lunch
1
Reserved this place for a birthday dinner with my friend two weeks ahead of time and sent confirmation/reminder one day before Sunday...BUT when I arrived....1) Table I had requested was not reserved for us.2) Cake was totally forgotten even though I was there early and reminded the staff about the cake and candle which I had requested and was confirmed by restaurant via email3) Cake was finally served after I had to go back and forth to remind the staff again and again....BUT no candle was provided4) We had to wait a LONG time for the bill5) The place was so hot and uncomfortableThe only saving grace was that the food was nice. But service was terrible...we think it's because the place is understaffed
5
Great food, drink and helpful staff. Both the Duxton and Sentosa Cove restaurants are great for a night out.
5
Thoughtful service staff who is attentive to your needs. Truthful personnel who gives you good food suggestions. (Scallops & Pork shoulder is a must try! Yummy chocolate lava cake completes my day and cheers to an ICE COLD BEER) Friendly peeps who will interact with you to make sure all is right and proper for a great nights out with family & friends. Superb and I will be back

went for dinner before the pet shop boys gig. was there around 6pm, just 2 other tables taken. although my wife and I did not make reservation, after promising the manager we would leave in an hour's time, he showed us to a good table, in the middle in the shade. many servers around, no problem getting their attention. great crispy pork belly!! good with bread!! can get tapwater, no need to buy still or sparkling.will go there again - ample parking space

This is restaurant makes a mockery of Singapore's compulsory service charge system. The place was operating at 3/4 capacity when we dined on a Saturday night. It took us almost 20 minutes before we could pin down one of the two managers to take our order. (The waiters are not authorized to do so.)Our group comprised 16, and we requested to separate the bill between the different couples/ families so we needn't sort out the payment later. We were told they could only do so for 3 bills. (why not 2 or 4 bills then?) Another couple who joined us late requested for the same, and the Caucasian manager made a face upon hearing it.The unpleasant experience was compounded by a mix up of orders, with the same manager telling us a dish had run out, only to have it served later towards the end of the meal. (He claims that we misheard him and only after much reasoning that the staff decided to take back the dish).Food-wise, the Spanish spread on offer was decent, as was the ambience. However, the woeful service from start to finish sours the entire experience
4
We went for brunch on Sunday morning. Sat at a table on the quayside with a view across the marina. For $S35 basket of breads - ciabatta, croissant and pain chocolate with butter and jam followed by suckling pig/omelette/ribeye steak, orange juice and tea/coffee - other drinks extra. Very well-prepared and presented

I had an informal business dinner last week in this restaurant. I was a little bit scared because my partner advised me about bad reviews. I guess something has changed, because everything was quite good. Service was warm and friendly, even in a busy night. Maybe they should get more staff, because it was a moment when everybody was so busy that it was difficult to get their attention, but when the waitress realised that we need the bill, she came quickly with it.Food is nice, not the best Spanish restaurant in Singapore, but better than the most part of them. I recommend Pimentos piquillo, what is Spanish red capsicum stuffed with chicken and cheese.Wine recommendation was very good. They also have Sangria, but we went for wine.The place is beautiful, decoration is awesome and the views of the Marina are quite good.Does it deserve the trip to Sentosa Cove? Good question, not easy to answer... But if you are there, go, it's the best restaurant around
1
1. Went in spite of poor service reviews.2. Poor service started upon arrival: had to personally walk to 3 different servers to ask for someone to take our order. Apparently only one "assistant manager" could take the order.3. Said asst mgr does poorly with order. I can't be bothered to elaborate. 4. Server comes with our orders of sangria and proceeds to spill a glass over the wife.5. Server panics and can do no better than stare. I have to tell him to just move off first. Wife goes to clean up.6. 10 minutes later, no one follows up with said spill at our table.7. Wife returns and says she overheard server telling colleagues he had cleared up. This was when she had to go ask for serviettes and club soda.8. I go to look for the manager, an european chap, who proceeds to ask me stupid qns like who spilled the glass. Clearly incapable of handling a restaurant so he proceeds to try and pretend that if he ignores the problem it will go away. 9. He was right to an extent. We walked out. 10. I am writing this as I have dinner at neighbouring brussel sprouts. I don't like to waste my personal time on this but the consistently bad service warrants a mention from me

This was one of the best tapas restaurants I have been to. The view was amazing, as it was quayside isle, we had a perfect view of the sea and some boats. The service was good and the dishes came fairly quick. I definitely recommend the capsicum stuffed with chicken and the churros. The churros were amazing, the deep fried cinnamon-sugar coated stick of soft, crispy deliciousness will not leave you disappointed. The capsicum stuffed with chicken was served steaming hot and fantastic. It was in a little pan with cheese on the top, it doesn't really look like capsicum and chicken but its really nice. I also had lamb chops which were delicious! It was tender on the inside and crisp on the outside. I also had chorizo sausage which is always amazing in Spanish restaurants. You will enjoy sabio by the sea.

Sunday brunch with the girls. We had omelettes, which were nice and a bread basket from the set menu. I requested an extra croissant, which seemed to really upset the staff and 3 different waiters came to check that I had the audacity to even ask! When we got our bill, we were charged for it! The nervous waiting staff seem to watch you at every turn. Plates and cutlery were taken away before we had finished and our table was wiped 9 times while we sat there which was annoying! Sabio should extend their breakfast menu,as there is a huge call for weekend brunch on Sentosa and only one other cafe doing decent breakfasts
2
The poor service at Sabio by the Sea really ruined what should have been an excellent time. Sabio sits on the marina at Sentosa, and the tables are all open air. The menu was fine with lots of assorted Tapas dishes. However, the service was a huge headache even though the restaurant was not crowded on a Sunday night and our host knew the manager. The waiters did not appear to understand English, carefully avoided us when we tried to get their attention, got our orders wrong, and made us wait 30 minutes to order desert. Finally, the Sangria was expensive and highly non-alcoholic
