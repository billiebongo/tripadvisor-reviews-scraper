We hosted our Son's 5th birthday Party at Ras Bites and it was very good. The planning was done last moment hence I would really appreciate the coordination of the crew members. Team has shown responsibility Right from menu selection up to party deco and service. Food was delicious and well arranged. I would recommend this place for such events. Thanks again for a wonderful service

I’m not a fan of Indian foods. I could only enjoy some of their menus but I couldn’t even name what I liked except for their dessert Gulab Jamun.

Working so close to this restaurant, I have always loved to taste their food (daily) be it the Kerala spices mixed Biryani or the evening snacks with Tea. The Veg Pakora is my all time favorite. I recommended this place for a Wedding Anniversary to be celebrated and the staff there did the rest of the MAGIC !!! It turned out to be a fascinating event. Very Co-operative staff, Great food to increase your appetite For the drink lovers they have their menu to cater all needs. Dont miss the JalJeera drink there.Vaidy(Citi

August 2017 ,we have celebrated 6th birthday for my daughter. We have had choosen one theme and requested for customize in both venue and food. mgr fully agreed and supportive to make awesome birthday party. Before the party they have nicely decorated the venue with our theme materials.Delicious food was prepared and served, all my friends & family were very much captivated by its taste. I would definitely recomment RAS Bites for organizing birthday party, with small demand, don't worry they will go extra to meet your needs. Good job and Thanks vm !

We ordered snacks (veg + non veg) for a office send-off from RAS bites. Everything was perfect and it was as great Friday evening. Happy to have chosen RAS for this occasion. We also found the buffet quality to have improved in the past 3-6 months. Good job and keep it up.

I recently booked for evening dinner cum birthday celebration for my kiddo, who turned 4 this year and I was not disappointed. Booking was done 15 day in advance for Saturday. Weekends are usually quite affair at CBP with very people coming for dinner. We booked for 25 pax and restaurant manager secured half of restaurant exclusively for us. They did decorations along with putting my sons name on banner. They distributed cake, also played picture slides made by us on their restaurant screens. In fact manager happily agreed for the kids to play musical chair inside. Buffet Food was above average with enough veg/non-veg menu and guests loved it. We just walked in with a pre-ordered cake... what else you can ask for.

We visited today to have tea and snacks. Manager taking order is very rude, no manners. Food is generally good here. But particular manager leaves bad taste every time.

I came with the family but the buffet was limited and lacks enough vegetarian items.I was even disappointed because I was hungry and couldn't get what I wanted.Please don't go if you're a vegetarian and you wanna have a good dinner or lunch!!

I've been visiting Ras Bites from more than an year now and it's always been a satisfying experience with the kind of quality and tasty food they offer but also due to the excellent service of its people.The birthday party of my Daughter was received extremely well by our guests and they all went back with a smile - that's what you want as a host. Isn't it?Thanks Ras Bites :-

We have visited this place which is close to our work place numerous occasions. The food and the buffet is awesome, value for money and most important smiling and courteous staff. To mention names, manage Ajeesh Nair, Deva and Raj who not only greet with simple but ensure you are comfortable and polite. We had numerous parties there as well as their evening high tea snacks remind of Delhi and Mumbai food, samosa chat, bhel puri, sev puri etc. Ris bites has one loyal customer. Keep up the good work, as in service and food industry the most important is the attitude of the people. Love you guys
