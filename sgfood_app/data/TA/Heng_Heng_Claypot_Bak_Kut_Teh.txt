we stayed right accross Heng Heng Bak Kut Teh, and noticed that it was always crowded during meal time. we tried it and it was clear why! the bak kut teh was tender, the soup was light but flavorful.

I have eaten here many times and upon reading many negative reviews on this site, I will say a few things in defense of this restaurant.In my opinion, the star of the show is really the fish and not the Bak Kut Teh (despite the name of the restaurant). This restaurant excels at Teochew style fish, of which there are two types. Firstly, they do delicious, fresh fish steamed Teochew style- a little spicy, with the tanginess of pickled plums. Secondly, they do a Teochew style fish which is served cold with some fresh lime squeezed over it. The flesh is delicate, sweet and tender and one is expected to eat the innards as well although that may not be everyone's cup of tea. If you would like a healthy breakfast of steamed fish, this is the place to go!Most comments on this site about the Bak kut teh are either positive or negative depending on the taste preferences of the reviewer. Whereas some reviewers enjoyed the light, peppery taste, many others have commented that the soup was "tasteless". My solution to those who prefer a more flavorful and tasty soup is to order abalone with your Bak kut teh. Although a little pricier, the flavor of the soup improves by several orders of magnitude upon adding abalone (I recommend the Calmex brand). The light, peppery soup base pairs perfectly with the rich umami of abalone in a way that the stronger tasting soups from most other Bak kut teh restaurants cannot

This is my favourite Bak Kut Teh, and I came here a few times before. I like its soup which was clear, with stronger taste of Chinese herbs than pepper. The salted vegetables was good too, slightly sweet, not very salty. The food did not make me thirsty after the meal. It was quite famous many years ago, but now, it seems that its name cannot be found in guide books, that make the young tourist have no idea about this place. Anyway, it is a good place for Bak Kut Teh

What a disappointment.Don't understand what people are raving about.The Bak Kut Teh in Claypot is not tender at all. The liver is only tender when delivered but gets harder when left in the claypot.Pig trotter was also not tender.Best we're the dough fritters and salted vegetables.Waiter came to the table to collect money and didn't even know what we had ordered despite all the left overs on the table.Most wait staff speak Mandarin only

You'll love this place if you are a fan of proper tea infused, peppery bak kut teh.The soup here is one of the best flavoured soups - a well balanced tea & garlic taste, with a hint of pepper. Not too over-powering unlike other places. The meat that we had were all of good cuts and i have no qualms about the quality of the bak kut teh soup here

Brought my European friend there for an authentic Bak Kut Teh experience, laid back environment. Tried the Claypot Bak kut teh and we each went for a second round. Feedback from my friend was that the soup was a little peppery but in a good way. Steamed fish was cheap, good and fresh, pork was delicious, and of course you have got to order the preserved vegetables to go along with it all

Laid back style coffee shop. They offer:- Bak Kut Teh - soup looks herbal. But it was light and tasty, not oily- Pig kidney and liver also available- Also order their braised pig trotters!- Fresh steamed fish (go to the chest freezer and pick the fish that you like and they will steam it for you)Try it

Why do some people describe Heng Heng's soup as tasteless...? To me, it's simply because they are used to/prefer a stronger taste...Fact of the matter is, and the reason why Heng Heng's fan keep coming back, is because their soup actually has a delicate, cleaner and more (albeit subtle) layers of flavours that other soups do not and cannot get because theirs are either too peppery or too heavy on the herbs..The soy pork trotters are a winner too.
