The fish and chips was good. Chicken avocado wrap was nice and warm.
Chicken soup of the day was delicious with chunks of chicken meat.
Good and pleasant service and they do not charge GST and service charge.

Having passed by this cafe numerous times whenever I visited Toa Payoh, it is located below shop houses and nearby Toa Payoh MRT. The cafe is cozy and decorated with Halloween theme now. We have ordered a charcoal waffle with 2 scoops of ice cream, we tried yuzu rasberry and lavender honey. Very unique taste and the charcoal waffle came in big portion. The serving is a bit slow though, but the crispyness of the waffle and tasty ice cream made up for it. Definitely will visit again to try on others food on the menu, highly recommended
