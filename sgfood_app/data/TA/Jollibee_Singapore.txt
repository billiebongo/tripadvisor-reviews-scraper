My first visit to Jollibee.... as good as KFC... it's Taste good... tender chicken... thumb up ! Recommend to other to try.
4
We love Jollibee and the food was great. I had Jolly Spaghetti and Chickenjoy which were tasty. The big problem is seating - it is too crowded.
4
We love the Food especially the chicken joy spaghetti with pineapple juice drink. We love also the burger steak

We visited Jollibee in Changi City Point on a Saturday evening. As we are a party of 6, we ordered 2 buckets of 6 & 8 pieces of chicken, spaghettis, rice, mashed potatoes, corn and French fries, among others. We had the original and wow, was the chicken tasty. The chicken pieces were juicy and taste really good. The gravy provided goes extremely well with the chicken and rice. The mash potatoes were good too. However, we felt that the spaghetti was mediocre. Service at this outlet is quick but polite. However, do note that seating is limited in the outlet at Changi City Point (Lucky Plaza has much more seats for customers) so a little wait might be necessary to get a table especially when you have a larger group.

They've got a strange queue system when we were there. Only one counter was open, resulting in a long line. A staff member goes down the line taking orders and hands you a piece of paper with the order on it. You pass it to the counter staff later. The fried chicken here is really quite decent, with much less batter than KFC, and therefore lighter on the palette. It definitely feels less greasy. The spaghetti was less sweet than I expected but don't expect gourmet. I would say it's somewhere in between canned spaghetti and what you would find at a trattoria. All in all, not bad for fast food but the queue system is still strange.

Jollibee is a place where you can never go wrong. The queue might be long at peak hours but it is manageable. I will recommend that you try their food at least once and it is up to you judge. Not that I am biased but I frequently see other nationalities eating here too. If all else fails, go to Jollibee. They have few branches in Singapore already like Lucky Plaza, Square 2, Paya Lebar Square and Changi City Point.

This is the only Filipino Fast Food Chain that has locations in Singapore and at different parts of the world. Though to the average Filipino the original taste might be different compared to the ones in the Philippines, still the taste of Chickenjoy, Spaghetti and Burger Steak is not that bad. Plus I see locals are also enjoying the spicy chickenjoy and the gravy that comes along with it, this fastfood chain is a must try for all

We had a snack... ordered spaghetti with chicken, jolly hotdog , fries and sundae. Comparing with quality frm PH, i still prefer the original. Spaghetti fails to carry the filipino tasted with sweetness. Thou in fairness portion is so generous. Hotdog taste is not good. Chicken joy is tender but it looks like that gravy is not good as in PH. Fries and Sundae are good. Service crew moves slower compared with crew frm PH

I am very disappointed, ordering online delivery from Jollibee and this is my first time expecting the same service from dining in to a online delivery! What's the point they put the word "customise" and "special instructions" in the order delivery form??? If they don't even bother to fulfil the said request?? I had requested a chicken thigh part but gave this 2 COLD chicken breast seems cooked from yesterday!! I'm up to the delivery delayed because weather was not that good but the food was really disappoint me! I don't recommend online delivery from this fast food JOLLIBEE they don't even bother to see or check what was your order request!

Really wanted to like this more but at the end of the day it is another average burger joint. Meet similar to Macdonalds which I guess is a complement. Other more expensive stuff still the freshest. Milk shakes/sodas all tasty and ice cream treats. Cheap pricing if that makes you feel better. Good luck and enjoy...

Taste of Chicken Joy is outstanding compare to KFC. Cleanliness is excellent. Staff very courteous and hard working excellent too.Price value is very good. It is unbeatable. Many nearby Jollibee restos.
Place can be noisy at times. And store layout needs improvement.
4
you got to try the chicken, it's very tender and juicy. ate it with spaghetti and pineapple juice. yummy!!
3
I have to admit Jollibee chicken is delicious. When you order the spicy chicken, you can taste it's really spicy, not some kind of local joking spicy. The menu is getting more variety but service staff could use more training, smile, and courteousy.

Crispylicious! Juicylicious!
Palabok still the best!
Fried Chicken, Spaghetti and Hamburger!
Kids will enjoy!

My second time having Jollibee fried chicken at Novena Square 2. This time I had minced chicken rice and coleslaw (second time) with 2 pieces of chicken at a price of $7.85. Unfortunately they don't serve any hot drinks hence I skipped the drinks. Overall the meal was wonderfully fresh and good as usual. Chicken are really tender, fresh and juicy and all parts are well cooked. It does not leave any thirsty feeling. Counter staff are friendly and patient. I went there at about 2.45 pm and the place was still buzzing with customers. I noticed that they cleaned up tables very fast after customers have left. Cost is kind of expensive and hence I only indulge in it when wanting to give myself a treat

I am typically a chicken joy fan. But today, the palabok wins. I was going for the 2 pcs chicken with rice and realised there is already palabok in the menu. I have not been to Jolibee for a while. So I ordered the set of a piece of chicken joy and palabok and a drink. The chicken with the gravy was ok and the gravy tasted original but the smell of the chicken itself is different... does Jolibee use a different type of oil? Looks like it.The palabok however was a winner, exactly the way I remembered it. Will come back for more

This is my ultimate comfort food. Regardless of race or nationality you will be surprised everyone enjoys every meal at Jollibee. Their menu is easy and affordable and food are of good quality. It may get crowded during peak hours (not the place if you have 1 hour office lunch time). There are solo meals and even group meals. There beef burger range and famous palabok can only be found in their Lucky Plaza Branch. If you only need their famous chickenjoy, fortunately they have opened branches in Square 2 and Paya Lebar Square

I often use Jollibee in the Philippines when I'm looking for a quick snack. I've never been to Jollibee in Singapore, but noticed one when I went for a medical appointment at Lucky Plaza. The food was just as good even if the price was almost three times as much as Manila.Friendly staff, good air conditioning and the usual decor including the friendly Jollibee. Located on 6th Floor above the medical complex on the 5th. Great authentic Filipino burgers!!!

Fried chicken and Palabok Fiesta are my favorite. Though this is a fast food restaurant, the quality of the food and service are not being compromised. Price is affordable. Kudos to the crews because they can maintain cleanliness of the store eventhough it is always packed and crowded
1
Fast food is supposed to be FAST! Service is very bad, i waited 20 mins for a simple order of palabok fiesta. They are very unorganized. They have que numbers but its not being followed. It could have been better if they just give the order straight to the customer upon ordering. This doesnt make sense. The food is not MTO like pizza, its already in the warmer! So many crew at the assembly area and they all seem lost. Manager keep scolding for wrong out also. Ridiculous
4
The food quality is inconsistent across branches, seems like the lucky plaza branch is better than the one in Novena.
5
This is our perfect family bonding time!!! Ate our favorite chicken joy with lotsa lotsa gravy, spags, and palabok!! shout out to Shalifah (hopefully spelled her name correctly) for her great service and initiative!!

Will surely miss Aloha burger and burgersteak at Jollibee Singapore stores. They no longer serve beef burgers. But the spicy chicken is still something to crave for.
4
If you are a Filipino dining at Jollibee, it always feels like home. I like all the food offerings especially the spicy chicken. My chinese friends like the spicy chicken and aloha burger.
4
The chicken is tender and juicy.
Price is reasonable and portion is just nice.
Worth a visit and will try their spicy chicken on my next visit.

I am a big fan of Jollibee. So even if I only spend 2 weeks in Singapore, I'm so happy to see that there's a Jollibee in Lucky Plaza. It is quite expensive, but its understandable because everything in Singapore is expensive.I'm also happy that the crew speaks Tagalog. but what i'm not happy about is that their food doesn't taste the same as the original Jollibee. Chicken not crispy, gravy tastes different and the spaghetti is sour, not as sweet as the original spaghetti
4
Though I grew in australia. I still get excited when I hear there's a Jollibee in town. It is delish! I love their chicken tenders with gravy as well as halo halo. So when I found out coming through singapore after my trip to europe that there's a jollibee in the lucky plaza...well it was the first priority. The line was long but worth it.

Jollibee at Novena Square 2. 25/Sept/2016, 8,44am - bare tables and empty chairs chorussing "Closing Time' (see photo). Diners snailing in and snaking up the order counter - barely fully woken up from the early morning blues.... yeah... the service staff too... at least the guy that attended to me.I picked up my take-away order. Prompt service... or so I thought.On my way out, checking, I discovered the small tub of gravy was missing from my chickenjoy spaghetti order. The guy apologised and made good the shortfall. I then decided to dig deep into my bag. No cutlery. No serviette. Geezzz.Jollibee... time to wake up and stop smelling the flowers. Popeye's, KFC, Burger King are swarming around for kills.Oh yes, the spaghetti sauce is too sweet, Personally, I would rather have it a tad tangy and more tomato based

We had a ha kering for fried chicken but were deciding between this and Texas Chicken. Since we were on the upper level, we chose Jolibee.The sets are priced from @$7 and come with two pieces of chicken, a tub of gravy, a drink, and a choice of fries, rice or mashed potato. We went with the spicy chicken - it was crispy on the outside and juicy within, and was not too oily. However, I think I prefer the one by KFC, which has more flavour. The fries here were also a little soggy yet dry within, and my wife said they tasted like cardboard.So, u less there are no other choices, I would give this a miss, even though the office crowds were queing up

We saw Jollibee opened after we came back from Malacca trip on Jan 24,2016. It was the first day opening in Square 2 at Novena. It was packed and Q was super long. Midday in Jan 27,2016 we saw each counters only had 4 peoples in line. We decided to try a set of 2 pieces of fried chicken. The chicken meat was well marinade and flour outside was crispy. In my opinion, quality and taste were a bit better than KFC.

I had a delicious burger here for just $2.60. I loved how it was called burger with TLC. staff were friendly and it was incredibly efficient .
4
Eating @ Jollibee is always good for me... Fried Chicken Burger Steak Mmmm Mmmm an I'm full full... Good value for money as well... So if I'm in Singapore or Manila I will be in Jollibee for sure.

The original Filipino fast food chain is making is way to the international market now first store in Singapore.. The taste of the chicken is very nice is one of my recommendations and burger steak. Yummy and good price.

1. Chickenjoy
2. Burger steak
3. Champ/TLC
4. Spaghetti
5. Jolly hotdog
Long queues are a norm I guess. Been hearing that there's gonna be a new branch opening soon. Hopefully they'll add palabok on the menu. Enjoy!

I went there on a weekday afternoon as weekend it's really long queue. I had the rice vermicelli which is unusual as it's sweet but tasty. Only downside is it's size portion too small. it's not expensive compare to McDonald's and much if it's food is towards sweetness not spiciness. It's nice try as I'll need travel to Philippine to eat this

Been hearing so much praises from my Filipino colleague Marcus, I decided to join them for a lunch session. The queue is pretty long for a fast-food restaurant, waited around 15mins before our turn. I jokingly told my friend, this gotta be a real tasty fried chicken if not our lunch for the rest of week will be on him.The menu covers from fried chicken, pasta to burgers. Like I said earlier, I'm here to try the fried chicken. I ordered a 2 pcs chicken-joy set, it also comes with a small pack of rice, gravy sauce and drink.Finding a seat after our order is not too difficult even at lunch hour. Maybe everyone is rushing, most people did not stay long. And you don't see any student conquering the dining table and convert them into study table.In my mind, I can't wait to try it, and hmmmmmm.... Yummy!!!!!! I have not tasted such a delicious fast food restaurant for a very long time. The seasoning of the chicken is perfect, the skin is crispy, the meat is pipping hot and to pair with the rice & gravy were absolutely brilliant! It was within minutes that I finished the set meal. I could said in my personal opinion, it is far better than "Finger Lick'in Good".I told Marcus, that is the best recommendation he ever given! Definitely will be back for more with family and more friends!!!!!

First thing when you open the door, there is a boundary for you to queue up to order you food. If you are there with your friends, you cannot find a seat first while your friends order their food unlike other style of fast food restaurant. When I was there with my friends, there were nobody in the queue and we had to look at the menu on top of the counter to decide what to order.We ordered the 6 piece chickens, fries and strawberry sundae. I like the fried, crispy skin of the chicken as there were little fats under the skin, but the meat is a little disappointing as it is dry and no as savoury as KFC. As for the price, it is more expensive as compared to Jollibee in Philippines

Ordered 4 take away chicken joy., my mistake is i did'nt even check it., i only found out that the staff that entertained me give me 4 small parts of the chicken 2 leg and 2 wing part., while on the counter there's a lot of big parts.. I hope nxt time be considerate., coz people patronized you on your service and food.,

I waited in line 30 minutes to order from the very nice tasty looking menu the huge Jollibee displays at the lucky plaza. After my order I gave the girl the NETTS card, she said ONLY CASH!!! Please, There is NO SIGN POSTED SAYING CASH ONLY. This is a MUST. So I went down 6 flights and went to the OCB C ATM to get cash and it was being serviced, so I waited 15 minutes there and got fed up so my friend and I left. TOO BAD I feel a big place like that SHOULD take credit and debit cards. WHY NOT!

Whenever in Asia, I try and get to Jollibee and was pleased to find one in Singapore. We had chickenjoy and steak meals which were good. I agree with the previous reviewer - I hope they have palabok in the future. This is a little piece of the Philippines in Singapore!Bear in mind that this place gets very busy on the weekend when the Filipino OWs are on a day off, so go during the week if you can - even on a Thursday at 4pm it was busy, but we got a seat..
