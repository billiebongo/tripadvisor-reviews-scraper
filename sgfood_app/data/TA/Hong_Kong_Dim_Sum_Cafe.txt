Visited this small dim sum place for lunch yesterday for the first time. A good selection of dim sum available. Service quite friendly. Prices seemed a little high given the type of place and the location but the food was good.

It's really a small shop in Fortune Center Bencoolen Rd. Serves good dim sum. Cozy for a small group of 2 - 4. A little pack but still ok if it's 5-8

Actually passed by this pearl many times before I realised what they served. Decent selection of dim sum and other dishes, but I went specifically for the dim sum. Like mentioned before by other reviewers, communication in English is a bit difficult, but the ordering process allows selecting what you want from a menu (English, Chinese and pictures) and writing down the selection without the need for verbal communication.The dim sum that I tried was pretty good

Everything was only ok. The pork was good and the ingredients were fresh but it was all missing something that made it authentic and flavorful. Even the chili sauce was mild. The egg tart was actually very good and highly recommended. Service was decent but they need to smile more.

Small cafe like place that has a menu of around a couple of dozen Dim Sum dishes available including the standards "Har Kau" and "Siew Mai".At each table is a coupon provided on which you indicate the quantity of each Dim Sum that you want. Service was quick. Liked that the waitress provided some chilli paste as well as the sweet chilli sauce that was on the table

Came across this on my way to a different dim sum place and decided not to walk any further. Food was delicious in this tiny little canteen type place that was full of locals on a Sunday afternoon. The kind man beside us, saw me struggling with my chopsticks and spoke to the waitress in Chinese. She promptly picked up 2 forks and delivered them to the table. I was determined though, and made it through with my chopsticks :) Planning to go back for dinner and try some different types of these tasty morsel

Just a short walk from the Hotel Ibis Bencoolen, this little cafe is located in the Fortune Shopping Centre. It serves only dim sum and noodles - and a great variety. The ordering process is simple: there's a list on the table and you tick the boxes for what you want and your server collects it. I had the Singapore bee hoon (a fried noodle dish), prawn har gow (which were tender and juicy), prawn and chive dumplings (good, but a touch bland) and cha siew bao (barbecued pork in steamed bun - there were 3 to an order and quite big). The bee hoon is a very generous portion of noodles! There are chili oil and other condiments on the counter if you want to spice things up. it's quite a small place, so it can be easy to miss as you walk along. The prices are higher than a hawker centre, but then it's quieter and less crowded. For taste and convenience, it's a good place to come for a light meal
