This is part of Universal...the NY section. We had vouchers so we went. We are from NY...well, it's not really pizza and it's not really Italian food. Cafeteria sort of disney style...we ate and had a good laugh...for that alone it was worth the trip.

Ordered the Pepperoni family combo and was blown away by the sheer size of the pizza. It is not only huge at 20" in diameter but it taste great as well. Thank goodness its thin crust and not thick crust.

I tried its family combo at 3PM and was surprise by the size of pizza. The taste is American style and really good but the accompanying soup was bad. 4 big Coke glasses were enough for the remaining time in USS.

Common Header: I was in Universal Studios Singapore on Friday night for a company event and had the chance to try two of the restaurants that opened that night.Louiâ€™s was my 2nd restaurant for the evening and it exceeded my expectationsFirst off, the pizza Is thin but done right (no burnt edges and was not soggy neither) The pasta was el dente and had the taste (some may find it sour though ) as it it was cooked by an Italian grandmother.Try their specials (giant meatball pasta) if you can.Sau

I visited the joint with my children during the September holidays. The pizzas were amazingly good. If you go in a bigger group, ordering the large pizza (believe me it is HUGE) for slightly over $50 will be a better deal. My children and I are soooo happy that we hold annual passes to Universal Studio. This means we can keep going back for our pizza fix! I did not check if they do a take-away. If they do, it would mean I could take-out for my other family members to enjoy. Let's hope they do that

This pizza place is a decent place to eat in universal studios Singapore, which has limited eating options. The pizza slices are large, and while vegetarians can only eat the margarita pizza, it tastes pretty good so no complaints. I remember I had the margarita pizza for lunch and dinner out of lack of options in Universal. For non vegetarians, there are options of different pizzas and desserts too. Kids will enjoy eating here.

We had Parmesan Chicken Pasta and it was delicious, crispy chicken, delicious tomato sauce and some good pasta

Not a great variety. Had the pizza slice and the wings, both were average. Nothing special about the place.

Nice place though no vegetarian option available except the margherita pizza! The taste was not so good but the place is good for those who are non vegetarians! Service is very fast

good pizza joint with very large pizzas. Nice setting in the New York world, air conditioned and family friendly. Found the bathrooms could be a bit more sanitary but it was after midday on a holiday

Made me remind of the pizza served in NYC. The perfect blend of tomato sauce and cheese. Fine place to eat with your kids

Smells brought me in...
It was a fun meal with friends.
Longer waiting time, but time wasn't wasted when chatting with good friends.
Would returning future.

Service was efficient and food was served quickly. Although it was a trouble finding seats, the pizza was worth a try. The restaurant had a new york setting. However, the pizzas are expensive. They are large though, and when I say large, I mean large. They are approximately thirty centimeters in radius. The seats and toilet however were not very clean

Had lunch here when we visited universal Studio Sentosa.If you order the meal separately it can be rather expensive but if you order the family meal deal you get s 29 in pizza, 4 drinks, garlic bread, 2 soups for $58.The food tasted nice for what appears to be a fast food joint and the service efficient

I was at Loui's NY Pizza Parlor when i brought my family to USS just 2 weeks back. We wanted to seat at the corner with red cushion and when we walked near, we can smell a really foul smell. The cushion seats were also torn and that was really a big turn-off. My children wanted pizza, so no choice we still dine the the restaurant but we chose the middle seat, away from the red cushion. Food is average, but the kids love the kids meal which comes with a collectable. I hope USS can really improve on the maintenance of the place and restaurants

Very nice place. I liked the food. Nice small place..... They serve good food. You should try it when you are around..

We tried three pizzas from here - Margarita, Chicken and Pepperoni, all of which were good. Pepperoni was the best though. The slices are thin-crust but as big as the plate. Also had Watermelon slices which were fresh and delicious. Definitely one of the cheaper dine-in options in Universal studios.

Never been to New York but have tasted the famous NY Pizza thanks to Loui's NY Pizza Parlor. You get to have the HUGE slices of pizza here. Though they have ample seating options, but still you might struggle for a place. Quick service is an add on. The options for vegetarians are limited but non-vegetarians have a array of selections to choose from. Set amongst NY streets, the place gives you a feeling of being in NY. Great place!

A visit to the vast and hectic Universal studios leaves a visitor really hungry. The pass given during entry has this Pizza parlor as one of the options. We visited the joint and opted for the vegetarian option since they had only pork pizzas in offering in non-vegetarian section and we in India mostly do not opt for pork. The offering was a slice of thin crust pizza. It was fresh, but the topping could have been a little more prominent. The cheese pizza surely needed more cheese. Nevertheless could satisfy our hunger

Nice big pizzas. Good for family with kids to share. Spacious dinning area. Easy access to washroom and souvenir shop.

If you like pizza after roaming around in the studio... just try... the menu is good... you would love the pizza...
5
Huge pizza that tastes great. Good for kids and adults alike. The place is cozy enough, cooling the heels before continuing exploring the park

Bit greasey, kids did not like really and was a bit of a queue - kids had an ice cream and they served up when main meal came, so by time got to half melted !!

I visited USS on December 12th, 2014. And had lunch at Loui's NY PIzza Parlor.It simple amazing for the taste of the food. I order pizza and drum stick, love the taste of both menu! Located near the stage, so you can sit and enjoying the food while watching attraction or performance in stage.Will come back again, for sure!

This is our usual spot for lunch whenever we are at the USS. The pizzas are good, as are the pastas. It's a little pricey since this is in the theme park, however, you can get a good deal from the combo meals if you are in a group.Have an early lunch as it gets crowded around noon onwards

we booked for "Sesame Street breakfast" which takes place in this restaurant as my kids wanted to meet the sesame street characters. I had a bit of accident (slipped on my back as it was raining) on the way to the restaurant and by the time we arrived it just few minutes past 11 am, but unfortunately they had already closed the buffet and of course the sesame street characters were already gone as they prepare for their show at 11:30. we told what happened to Mr.Ashley who was the duty manager that manager. It was amazing how tentative he was to our case and they were glad to open the buffet just for us and that was amazing. they did their best to bring us the sesame street characters but it was too late. anyways, we had our breakfast and again Ashley and his team they surprised us when they told us that they are already booked us in the sesame street "meet and greet" long que. we were so touched by the effort they made to recreate the experience that they were supposed to have if we had arrived earlier for the breakfast. Myself and my family were immensely impressed with their friendliness and willing to help. it was very personal and it was very touching.after a long day in Universal studio we decided to go back for lunch. I'm telling you those guys have the best margarita pizza in town and we enjoyed uninterrupted view of the Universal studio parade which passes right in front of the restaurant. I strongly recommend that you book your lunch with them so that you enjoy full view of the parade while being seated enjoying the pizza and the soup :-)All the staff came to ask us how the day so far and they were extremely friendly to my kids. Mr. Ashley suggested that we should stay to attend the Fireworks show. I thanked for the suggestion but I prefer to go back to the hotel to get some rest. Few minutes later, Mr. Ashley came back to me saying that he spoke with Mr. Daniel and they are ready to offer myself and my family a balcony view of the fireworks available only to diners of one of the restaurants facing the lake. that was when myself and my family went speechless and we were really overwhelmed with what they are doing to help me enjoy the park. We were so touched by that. That night Mr.Daniel who was the duty manager of the other restaurant (if I recall correct) received us in person and walked us to the balcony where we had an amazing view of the Fireworks.Thank you so much Loui's NY Pizza Parlor, Mr.Ashley, Mr.Daniel, and the team of course for giving us a wonderful day in Universal Studios. we truly appreciate it. Looking forward to meeting you on our next visit.Dear Reader: I strongly recommend this restaurant; super friendly staff, best pizza in town, and the best location to watch the parade from

We stopped there for a 20" family pizza during our USS trip. The pizza is nice and filling, and it was appeasing on the eyes too. As with most shops and restaurants in the USS, the cost is a bit on the higher side ($60 for the package of 4 soft drinks, ice creams and 20" pizza), but we didn't mind as we were famished. Recommended for vegetarians too

The chicken spaghetti was lovely. My kids loved the tomato puree. The staff was generous to give an extra scoop when I asked for more. The kids meals came with an orange juice AND a transformers straw!!! Perfect for my boys! Was rushing for a show so we skipped on the pizza, which requires a little waiting time.

We as vegetarian, visited this pizza parlor with much expectations for at least one decently tasting pizza and pasta, but were disappointed at it has only one margarita pizza which tastes awe full. The Alfredo pasta with white sauce was utterly disappointing and tasteless. The only saving grace was the Heineken beer. At 35$ for all this, we felt we just wasted our money
