If you are looking for a place for authentic Eurasian food, come here. Chef does a great job creating dishes such as itek tim and babi pongteh and ayam buah keluak. Dont miss the kueh kuehs too

Only 2 of us . Staff recommended buah keluak fried rice which was way to much for 2pax. The other 2 dishes were average. Had better ones elsewhere. The dessert was excellent tho.
4
The food was flavorful and varied in flavorful though it ended rather flatly with a starchy and pale Kueh Bingka dessert. Save your calories for dessert and conversation elsewhere as the noise level in this restaurant is deafening

Went there with 4 paxs for lunch as it is during the Chinese New Year they only serve set lunch and not the ala carte menu. We were not at all disappointed. Ngoh Hiang was good so is the Chap Chye and the 4angled Bean Salad not forgetting the Otah. Desert was jus as delicious. Will definitely be back to try the ala carte menu soon

I came across from the overhead bridge across Beach Road. There was no visible signage that read Folklore. I walked up and down the corridor only to discover the single glass door with the keypad was the entrance to Folklore. All the time within the restaurant, service staff could see me walking up and down however, no one came out of the door to ask if they could help. The entrance signage has to be improved. Food was better than what they previously had at the former restaurant Immigrant. The five bean salad was too spicy to be eaten as a salad. This should have been moderated. The desserts were pricey for the quantity, small portion.

A party of 3 for dinner. Quality of food was not as expected, I thought we get a better deal just across the road at the food centre. To complicate, the white rice which is much needed to go down well with these dishes was not up to expectation and the manager and chefs insisted that they are good and tasty while we find it hard to swallow. I think Damien will be very disappointed

Folklore is a Peranakan (Straits Chinese) style restaurant helmed by Chef Damian D’Silva. I met Chef Damian and tasted his cooking when he was in Joo Chiat - Immigrants Gastrobar which has since closed down.Chef Damian is a chef with the right passion and culinary skill and it tells in his cooking. Using the right ingredients and ensuring that they are fresh is the key to Chef Damian’s cooking. One needs to understand the different cuts of meat, characteristic of each spice and herb in order to mix them and bring out the best flavours. I trust Chef Damian’s cooking and that is why I have always returned to his restaurants wherever he may go.Folklore does not disappoint - some signature dishes are the Beef Cheek Rendang, Buah Keluak fried rice and Singgang are must try dishes.We started with the Ngoh Hiang which is the meat version of a spring roll. In the case of Chef Damian’s version, he uses water chestnut, minced pork and prawns marinate it with his own spices and wraps it in bean curd skin. Fried to perfection, the Ngoh Hiang is a perfect accompaniment to beer. The firm bite and crunchiness provided for by the water chestnut is a great contrast in texture.Next up is the Babi Ayam which is pork belly braised in a tamarind gravy. You get the taste of spices like cinnamon and star anise and the pork is melt in your mouth type and the tamarind gives that sweet sour consistency. Excellent dish.The Buah Keluak fried rice is another winner. Buah Keluak is a nut (some call it fruit). In its raw form Buah Keluak contains cyanide and is poisonous but if properly cured and prepared, the resulting paste is absolutely tasty - acquired taste actually. Chef Damian’s version of Buah Keluak fried rice comes top with a fried egg, done sunny side up. The proper way of eating this is to break the yolk and mix it with the fried rice - adds to the flavour of the rice. One of a kind dish that is difficult to find in restaurants in Singapore.The Beef Cheek Rendang is perhaps one of the highlight dish but I have to confess about not trying this dish - I don’t eat beef. But all my friends who visit Folklore swear by this dish. The beef cheek is braised in a gravy made with 15 different herbs and spices till tender. The beef cheek is fork tender and the thick gravy is aromatic and has the right level of spiciness.Singgang is a Eurasian dish that I have not seen in any other restaurant. This is my favourite dish by Chef Damian. He uses the meat of the wolf herring and cooks them in a non spicy paste - the best way to describe this is deboned fish meat cooked like otah otah except that it is all fish meat.We also had the Ayam Pelencheng which is a whole slab of chicken thigh marinated in spice and then grilled. Served with a slice of lime, the meat is tender and firm to the bite.What you will taste in Folklore is authentic cooking by Chef Damian. He uses fresh ingredients and will not tame his cooking for anyone - what you will get is his original version, the Damian’s take on Peranakan and Eurasian food. Always enjoyable when I visit Chef Damian

Always a pleasure coming to Folklore. Service is great. Food is exceptional. Chef Damien has outdone himself! The food just taste better and better each time we are here. Have recommended couple of families and friends and they too agree the food is exceptional! For a true taste of Peranakan dishes, Folklore should definitely be your TOP choice.

This restaurant serves authentic Peranakan cuisine. Having tasted the dishes, I know that the chef has cooked these dishes with much love.The ingredients used are fresh and the portions are quite large. For two persons, I would recommend ordering 2 or 3 dishes, excluding rice. A must-try dessert is Kuih Kosui. The coconut flakes added to this dessert is so fresh.I will definitely return and also tell my friends about it.Highly recommended for visitors who want to experience Peranakan cuisine.

When it's busy, Folklore is understaffed and one has to be very, very patient.The best way to enjoy Chef Damian D'Silva's unique Eurasian-Peranakan offerings is to book an early slot, arrive ahead of the crowds, order fast and enjoy the meal at a more leisurely pace. Which is exactly what we did on a Thursday evening. The waitstaff were not under stress since we were the earliest arrivals and had time to go through the menu with us, making helpful suggestions to complement our predilections. Our order of Singgang arrived promptly and after a short interval, the rest of the dishes, including the memorable Sambal Buah Keluak Fried Rice and Seafood Otak followed suit. We pigged out discreetly and had to sacrifice a few mouthfuls in order to reserve space for dessert. The Gula Melaka brought back memories of our 1960s childhood, when it was commonly referred to as sago pudding

The food was very good. Pity there were many dishes not available.
The venue was quaint but noise really carries in that place cos of all the hard surfaces.
5
We went there for new year’s eve. Everything was good. Food, service and atmosphere were all good. Felt that more staff could have been deployed

Went to Destination hotel located next to golden mile for lunch at this restaurant. Likes the ngoh hiang and a dish called Singgang which is a must try.

The food is fantastic. It appears under-staffed so service though still very cheerful, is somewhat patchy.

I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for a while and decided to take friends as a thank you dinner.. Before we ordered we were told that about 5 items were not available, then after we ordered another item was suddenly not available either. Mist of the food we were able to order was excellent but for the Sotong Hitam - my piece and one of my friends felt like eating pins and needles!! I suspect that the filling had the cartilage blended with the other items. The taste was delicious but the effect on the tongue was awful . And it was a very expensive meal out!! Before I go again I will confirm that the menu is all available - suggest that you do the same.

The Christmas spread, especially the curry debal with its chunks of tender bacon bones, was a treat. So was the babi assam, sweet potato leaves with prawns, the awesome buah keluak fried rice, and the custard with gula melaka. My four friends had never been to Folklore nor heard of it before our visit. All were impressed and said they would be back with their families. Chef Damian is the real deal. As long as he is there, Folklore will rock

Recently there have been a number of restaurants serving fairly good quality local cuisine... lying somewhere between peranakan, Eurasian, and straits Chinese, food, folklore has quite a nicely paced menu. The place feels like a canteen... unpretentious, casual, inexpensive. Would certainly return for another meal soon.

Was expecting to wait very long but it was ok. The staff were all very young but provided good service. Nice small restaurant. There were 2 of us n we wanted to try more than 2 dishes.The food was ok; the beef renang was v soft but didnt taste like rendang at all. We tried the buah keluak fried rice which had a lot of buah keluak but the rice was soo soft. Was it meant to be? The portions were too large. Even after we split n doggy bagged the balance of the rendang it was still too much. I suggest that the portions be halved so that people can try more dishes. And they can charge a little more than half.

If you're a local - I'm pretty sure you'll have heard it from your friends by now, even though the restaurant is only open for business in late 2017.If you're a tourist - and you're adventurous in food - and want to try out the local version of "fusion" food with the nice blend between Peranakan and Eurasian. You should consider Folklore - where it may not be as famous as other places that you may have read about (since it is still relatively new), but I can assure you that it'll be a good, fulfilling meal as long as you're up for something spicy. If you look at the pictures shared - I go with 3 main dishes, which are - (1) Sambal Binjal - I like binjal - esp. when it is stir fried and it is wrapped with sambal (chilli). (2) Rendang Beef Cheek - The beef cheek is tender and nicely seasoned, and it is slow cooked to perfection with the thick sauce that is somewhat spicy, and it is perfect to eat it with your rice, together with the binjal. (3) Grilled Chicken - The chicken is lightly grilled, and the meat is tender - when you squeeze the lime juice onto it - it is both tasty and refreshing.(4) Desserts - We went for 2 different desserts which I forgot the local name. The Tapioca Cake is tangy (not too sweet), and it is good to eat with the thick black sugar sauce (gula melaka). Similarly - the gula melaka kueh with the coconut floss is addictive, where one can easily eat 3-4 pieces within a short period of time.The restaurant is located at the second floor of this local hotel called Destination, right next to the hotel reception. And the building is just next to the famous Golden Mile Complex or across the Beach Road Hawker Center. The hotels that are closed to the restaurants are - Park Royal (Beach Road), Pan Pacific (Beach Road) or the newly opened Andaz at the Duo Building. Similarly, if you are staying in the V hotel near Lavendar train station, you can walk across the local apartment and get there within 10-15 minutes time

Great delicious Peranakan food.Polite waiter and manager.Good chef.Ambient is nice (but can improve firther because not all seats are with cushions)Price is slightly abv average but definitely taste better than so-called authentic Peranakan restaurant in Singapore. Desserts are a must to eat in this restaurant.
5
The food was absolutely delicious! As Peranakan food is quite rich, we ordered one dish too many. Every mouthful was punchy and bursting with flavours.
5
The sambal buah keluak fried rice is a must try as well as the kueh kosui!
Fourth time back here in the last 3 months! Loving it!

Chef d'silva delivers on heritage peranakan and Eurasian food. I'm so happy he's back in the kitchen. Food is excellent
4
Some of the portions looked deceptively small, but after passing the dish between 6 people, there was still enough for second helpings and then some. Great food, prompt service and value for money. (we even had to doggy bag the leftovers!)
5
An unforgettable culinary experience! I will certainly visit again. Excellent service!! Great value for money!

Not sure if my visiting time is not correct or the entire restaurant is too busy. We (party of 4) don't enjoy at all. Food was not up to my expectation (I might be no Peranakan expert) but how should a Rendang Beef go very chewy might not need a gourmet to tell the difference right ? I had a so so dining experience with Folklore after all for this visit. And things just don't go right when you raised your hand to ask for drinks but yet service was so busy that no one actually sees me after like 3 minutes

My friend was craving peranakan food and i read about this newish place from the local newspaper. It's a small restaurant that shares the lobby space of a 3-4 star boutique/backpacker hotelI arrived on time and my friend was 20-25min late. During that time i wasn't offered any waterOrdered the usual - chap chye, buah keluak and otak. All good. The buah keluak came without the shells. They took all the paste out for you$80 for 2 pa

Folklore was reccomended to us and we are sure glad it was! It is a clean and trendy place with awesome food. Our favourite dish was the Sambal Buah Keluak! Quite spicy but different than anything else that we tried in Singapore. A must-go even if it is a little bit out of the way
5
it was a very bright and spacious restaurants. Nicely decorated. - Hospitality: the service from young (seems to be students) waiters are 'green' however, friendly. Overall services are very friendly and attentive. - food: we ordered many to share. the highlight was spicy beef, which is very 'SPICY', but delicious in every way - The tenderness of texture and the juicy sauce. Recommended for Family, friends gathering. Suitable for young couple dates too

We went to Folklore on a Sat night and the restaurant wasn't full. The food was fantastic but the service was horrendous. The waitering staff seems to be at a lost and not trained at all. We had to ask many times to replenish water and the waiter took many trips to bring us cutlery and clearing the plate, one at a time which is laughable.
5
This was my second visit to this restaurant. I cannot seem to get enough of the Buah keluak. Their oxtail is really flavourful. The sambal belacan is very lethal. I am a chilli padi eater and I would describe it as spicy!
4
Very nice ambience. Spacious area. Very attentive and good service from the staff. But Chap Chye was lacking in flavour, Oxtail Stew not tender enough, and Singgang a bit too salty.
5
Every dish we ordered was delicious. We especially loved the "otah like" singgang , it tasted just like otah but without the flour that is usually used as a binder. Will certainly order that again.

Wonderful fusion Peranakan Eurasian cuisine in a casual restaurant in Destination Hotel. Parking is free but you have to take a car lift so there’s some excitement with that.The sambal buah keluak fried rice was just superb. We had the tender beef rendang and the oxtail stew, as well as a delicious sambal juliana with fried brinjal. The seafood otak was good but the ngoh hiang was a tad dry and a little disappointing. There wasn’t much of a selection of Eurasian food so we took the singgang which was a tasty boneless fragrant fish dish.Must leave space for dessert - Kueh bengkah with ice cream and gula melaka was our favourite. The baked custard with gula melaka was smooth and delectable. Give the sago gula melaka a miss. It had a funny after-taste.Service was prompt and helpful. I’d certainly go back again esp for that mouth watering buah keluak fried rice

Folklore has won many accolades as a Heritage Food restaurant by providing Peranakan and Eurasian cuisine. Monday is usually quiet for most restaurants in Singapore, but I was surprised to see that it was running in full capacity. Therefore, the service standard was not as good as expected, but the food quality was excellent
4
Finally, a nice good restaurant to eat at when in this part of Beach Road to catch a movie at The Projector. Judging by the crowd that were dining here on a Tuesday evening, it is testament enough for the quality of the food served. The staff are attentive, friendly and accommodating. Good place to go to for family and social gatherings

1) Sambal Buah Keluak fried rice is surprisingly yummy! 2) Peranakan Chap Chye is good on its own or you can have it with rice too! 3) I dunno how Ayam Sioh should taste like but it is tender..4) Kueh Bengkah with ice cream - tapioca cake is moist and fragrant! Good on its own too

Dined at folklore on a double date. All 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed the food and the evening. Serving size appeared small, but as the food is rich, it worked out to be just right. We shared 4 dishes between the 4 of us. Ayam Pelencheng was well executed and juicy. Sambal Buah Keluak is a must. Was yummy with rice and we were scrapping the bottom of the bowl. They didn't have rendang that day, so we settled for Singgang. It was my first time having it, and I was happy with it. I love 4 angled beans, and the salad offered here was refreshing, and worked well to cut through the richer dishes. It also offered some textural stimulation that wasn't as present in the other dishes. We were so engrossed in our conversations that I didn't notice the service very much, so can't comment much about it except there wasn't a lack of it
5
Great Peranakan traditional food ,it’s not easy to find this anymore and Folklore just nails it.We ordered Ayam Lemak Chilli Padi (Chicken dish) it was on the Spicy side ,but you can ordered it less spicy ,It was tasty and fragrant ,it tasted like home made food ,it was really good A vegetable dish ,can’t remember the name but it had shrimp and sweet potato leaves and shrimp paste ,it was good .And the fish was Arang Asam I️ think ,forget me if I️ am not writing it right ,but if you see anything like that ,go ahead ,the fish was fantastic,tasted of tamarind tomato and chilli perfectly combined.For dessert we got tapioca pudding sweetened with palm sugar and coconut flakes ,and we finished the whole thing ,not too sweet but just the perfect amount of sweetness and the grated coconut on top made this an incredible dessert.Don’t expect ,the best service , they are definitely slaking on that aspect ,not on top things ...but they were decent .I️ would definitely go back for the food
5
Second visit and it was once again highly enjoyable. On the menu here are several dishes you won't find anywhere else. That's because these dishes require preparation too complicated for most commercial kitchens. That Folklore offers these dishes shows how confident and committed the chef is to Singapore cuisine.You can taste the care and passion that went into each dish. Venue could be a tad noisy and the wait staff a little stretched though they are friendly. Will definitely be back to try more dishes!
