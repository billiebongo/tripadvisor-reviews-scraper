Duck pizza never fails to disappoint. Must try. Service was average. The tables are a little low and made it a little inconvenient to eat.
3
Out for a casual meal with work acquaintances, nice live music. Service was steady even though it was busy. Food very nice, but the backdrop view of the Singapore River and Boat Quay was beautiful at night. Great location.
4
We can order with their app and pay bill also . So, it's convenient and our orders can't be wrong . I like their Satay .

Nice outdoor area where the band plays with views of the river.
Service was ok. Great location.
Drinks aren't cheap though.

My friend took me to Timbre, which is right on the waterfront but across from all the touristy busyness. It’s the perfect spot to have a few drinks and a bite to eat with friends or just a hangout spot to chill with a great view of the Singapore river!When I went, there was this awesome band playing live music which was just perfect for chilling and grooving to some tunes! I’ll definitely return even if it was just for some me-time
4
The location of this restaurant and pub is really good, being located just right in front of the Singapore river, opposite Boat Quay! Ideal for an evening of relaxing time with friends, family or colleagues. Food choices are very wide, catered to vegetarians too. Lots of choices for beer and wine. Best part is a live band that plays almost every night and rotates worth different bands. You can even SMS your song requests and the request will be displayed on a TV display
4
This place is an awesome place if you need a place to hang out with friends. It is within Clark quay area. What they have in their menu? Western food like spaghetti, fried chicken and of course alcohol drinks. The live band tonight is awesome. Sorry can't remember the band name. The price on the menu is around SGD20-30. And you can order through mobile app. That's cool. Service here is good. A bit crowded and full with people since dinner time. Make sure you come early or book a place after 7pm.

Ive been to Timbre for many time and still wanted to come back, me and my friends went to chill and enjoyed the nice music. The band was amazing that even played all my request songs. nice place to chill and listen to ur choice of music
5
I've been here before over a couple of years and each time it's a great experience. The pizzas are great (I don't like pizza but everyone at my table raved about them), the drinks are well mixed, the staff are very friendly, and the music is top notch. As with any of the bars along the Boat / Clark / Robinson Quays you're not going to get budget booze. Get over it. But the location on the River and the views from Timbre are very relaxing (particularly after the noise and mayhem of the F1 area). This spot isn't as crazy as the Clark Quay bars, and not a rip off like some on Boat Quay. It's chill.Every time I've been here they've had very good cover bands. This time was no exception and I've forgotten the name of the band but it was the Sunday night group and the bass player has a 5 string Sadowsky - you know who you are. Great guys and ace musicians.If you're looking for a chill, fun place to relax and take in some scenery and music you can't go past Timbre

Had a business dinner and drinks in their function room there, food and drinks were decent, service average; was also a little confused/irritated when at 1030pm they asked if we were still eating some of the food to which we politely said we were not, and they began to clear away the untouched plates of food, leaving behind the empty plates. Will consider other options next time
5
I love the location. The music band is always nice. The pizza is alittle too much for 2 of us as we still have other side dish. I would recommend going in a group of 4. The buffalo wings taste really nice too.
4
good place to chill with friends after work, located near the CBD. bites here are pretty tasty, with a few good pizzas, as well as wings. live bands come on periodically as well, as with most of the other Timbre establishments.
5
Awesome atmosphere with both indoor and alfresco dining.
The mignon chunks were tender and juicy.
The berry-ed treasure (cocktail) was good and the timbre edition beer was refreshing.
Service was great and the live band was interactive.
4
Was there for a farewell dinner. The live band were great, and we enjoyed ourselves.
However, I feel the place is small? When I need to go to the toilet or smoke, I had to tiptoe so I won't hit another person's chair.
3
Service was normal, not bad and not fabulous either. I prefer the music at Switch Timbre however i felt that the ambience and scenery are better at this outlet as Switch Timbre are indoors.
5
We decided to have our first Singapore Sling at Timbre whilst listening to the live performers.We were drawn in whilst walking past and hearing the music and songs being performed by Sureth. He was one of 3 quality performers on the night but definitely stood out.The cocktails were served quickly and prices were reasonable.Definitely somewhere to sit and soak it all in
4
Both these 'music Bars' are located at art house. Idea is to promote local musicians.Barbara shop plays jazz and timber plays pop music. Latter is better for young.Mug of beer ranges between 15-20$Food is mainly bits/pizzas.Atmosphere is quite vibrant and i think it's quite worth while for the tourists to experience the young generation of Singaporeans
4
The food is good and service relatively okay. Their app does not work though on my phone and their reservation system is really silly. After you reserve they spam call you (computer generated) on the day itself. You have to pick up (even at work) just to reconfirm your reservation. If you miss the calls, there's like 10 calls in 1 hour. Really ridiculous
4
To me, the highlights of Timbre are their pizza and music.The thin crust pizza is delicious. 3 pizzas were enough to feed 6 of us. I recommend getting the half-and-half to experience all the different flavours. The duck is a must try.They also have local musicians playing, though they don't start til 9pm.
4
My colleagues and I were here to celebrate start of the year with drinks and light dinner. Ambience by the river was greeted with great views of buildings tall and short, modern and history as sun set. The transition from evening to night provided really good photo opportunities as well.
4
Had dinner there at around 8pm. Relatively good bar food, esp the duck pizza. Good beers, good live music and relatively swift service. Will recommend for a girls' night out or a casual date night!
5
We really enjoyed our drinks with excellent live music. The view to the river is great and the atmosphere is laid back - a really enjoyable spot for a drink in the evening.
4
Well priced drinks, good service, a rockn covers band (no so loud as to drown out conversation), and a terrific location outside on the river. Not as manic as some of the bars at Clarke Quay. Definitely worth a look.
4
Enjoyed an evening at Timbre with friends. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced for SGP (16-18 per head). The pizzas were also very good, although they could be more crispy. The live band was also good. All in all an enjoyable evening.
5
Good place to go to. Remember to go early/ reserve a slot in advance. Live band depending on the days. The drinks there are not bad as well is the food. Duck pizza is a must try. Wings as well. Good for a group gathering
4
Lovely ambience, alfresco dining available. I prefer to eat in the comfort of the air-conditioning indoors, but those who prefer to be up close and personal with the band can sit under the stars and enjoy their pint.
1
came in to get a duck pizza, mentioned it to the staff multiple times. After ordering, one of their stuff came and told us after (first time hearing about it) that we had to buy one pint each. It would be good if they had informed us earlier. We tried to explain that but they were adamant that we had to purchase beers so we decided to head somewhere else. The manager was not too pleased about it and when we tried to explain that we were happy to pay for the pizza but we didn't want drinks, we were told that we "anyhow ran away". Thanks. Anyway long story short we went back for the pizza without drinks. But as much as the pizza was good, the experience was..... Obviously nothing to rave about. Definitely a dampener to the spirit. Not sure if we will ever be back
3
Nice ambient by the river overlooking Clarke quay. Reservation system need improvement as I booked thru the Internet on the Thursday 1st Dec but didn't get the confirmation until the day of the dinner which was Tuesday 6th Dec. Tried to call the restaurant but the line was badly engaged. Food is nice.
2
Went there with a group of friends for a quick meal before catching a play at the Art House. Food was decent though was a little disappointed with the duck pizza after reading rave reviews about it. What was frustrating was that each of us must order at least 1 drink with the meal and they do not serve water even if we didn't mind that it is from the tap. Water in Singapore is portable and restaurants which charge or don't serve water always get a thumbs down from me.
4
We love 80's and 90's music and the band playing was great. The service is quick, friendly and efficient. We had pizzas and mixed drinks and it was perfect fit he night. We had a great time
4
Comfort food across from boat quay. Loved the buffalo chicken wings, chorizo with prawns tapas, pizzas all good. Draft beers were a thumbs up from my colleagues. Live music that comes on is bonus.overall a casual yet good enough for bringing business associates to
4
Great for chill out but not for gathering whereby the live band had empower our conversation.
Thumbs up for the Roasted Duck Pizza with Popiah skin..Still drooling now despite just had it 24 hours ago...
4
I absoloutely love this place. It has live bands performing most of the days, and They play your requests or sing birthday wishes for making your day special. They serve really delicious food and starters and cocktails. I love their Pizzas, crispy, thin, and yummy. The best part = they have the Order through the given tablet facility, so you don't really have to keep looking and waiting for the waiter to arrive so you could order.the place remains a bit crowded because of the awesomeness, so you might need to wait on a weekend.it's difficult to talk or discuss stuff, because of the super loud music, so not recommended for a first date, or an catch up after a long time
4
We arrived late in the night and ordered the Timbre Buffalo wings topped with devil sauce and nuts which could be even spicier (for I loved spicy food!) and the truffle fries. Only wished the portion of the fries could be larger hence better for sharing. Loved the beers as well.We sat outdoors, far right outside and could still hear the sound clearly. Indoors sounded quite noisy as it was quite packed. Only unsatisfactory issue was we were seated and told that we would be given an ipad for order taking which didn't arrive. The service was way too sloooow and I even had to walk to the service crews to get them to provide an ipad. Overall, it was still an enjoyable night and I would be back for the other food and music
5
Outdoor table recommended than indoor table. We sat at the ouside table as indoor was a bit crowded and the band inside was more of a noise than music. when we moved outside, their band was better and you can make some requests and dedicate to anyone you like. the food was great. you have to place orders via a tablet that is on the table assigned yo you. this is the modern way they do in SG and you do not have to wait for someone to take your order. my overall rating is very good service and the atmosphere was excellent
5
We went here by way of a recommendation from a website and were not disappointed. The restaurant isn't actually in the Arts House, but in a building to the left of it called "The Barber Shop". We ordered the cheeseburger pizza and it was really good. On top of that, the server was always scanning the tables with her eyes, anytime I needed something I turned around and within 3 seconds our eyes met and she came over to see how she could help us. Will definitely come here again during our next trip to Singapore
5
Thank you Timbre! We went over to celebrate a friend's bachelorette and the live band accommodated our request and made her perform! The manager on duty on 12/3/16 was amazing! Not only was wait staff efficient, the manager personally came over with a game and a shot for the bride to be. Service was impeccable and the personal touch goes a long Long way. We will continue to visit timbre. Good impression n yes, duck pizza and wings were delicious. Mojito perfect :)

A pity this joint replaced one of Singapore's better Asian restaurants - that said the business model here obviously works. Booked out; high prices and everything on the menu ordered via a smart device. On a positive note, it supports live music even if the band we listened to played vanilla covers (I mean why would a group whose parents were not born when the Beatles released "Help" play such a corny oldie?)The food was pretty average for pub food. We ordered a pizza - way too much cheese guys. The second main came out 15 minutes later. Sure the wait staff were apologetic but how hard is it to be coordinated in the kitchen Chef? As is the case in Singas, alcohol is hugely expensive so drink slowly . . 
4
Heard a lot about this place and it was hard to get a table during the weekend. The live band sounded good but I think my table was too close to the speaker so the music was a tad too loud. They serve fusion food here and my personal favourite was the duck pizza which is topped with BBQ sauce. Great place for dinner and to chill with some friends over a few cold ones and good music
4
Awesome ambiance and the bands performing during weekends are usually awesome. Try the duck pizza, and pick the seats outside as it is usually way too noisy to talk to your friends if you are too close to the stage, unless you are just there for the music. A common hangout place for my friends & I
4
A great place to wind-down with friends. Nice ambience with great live music. Ordered the duck pizza which is a good serving for 2 persons.Overall nice experience!
4
Went for duck pizza and it was lovely.
View over the city is great and the service we received wqs good"!
5
The singer is quite good and worth to go listen and enjoy atmosphere. I went there alone. That's no problem go alone there. You can enjoy yourself. The waiter will not disturb you during you listen music. In addition, you can order the song you love. The food price is fair. Not too cheap and not too expense. I order two drink and buffalo wing. total SGD 39. If you want to listen heave metal and rocking roll music. Please go there. Most of music play here is popular music. You will like it.

Predominately younger university crowd. As they say, Singaporians work hard and party hard. It's a loud place with a friendly helpful staff and decent food. The thin crust pizza was actually very good as was the assorted appetizer combo. Can be a little hard to find as it is in an alley behind the theater. Just follow your ears or the crowd.They do have a smoking section if you want to smoke with your drinks. They have live bands but we were there on a Saturday night and left about 10PM and there were none so not sure what time they start. I hear it is open until the wee hours of the morning.Good place to put away some beers and grub. Moderately priced by Singapore standards.
5
We stumbled upon this place, desperte for toilets! Very busy with a series of live band some better than others (one was a copy of Bjork).Great atmosphere & ambiance.Good service & the food was ok- fresh processed. Truffle fries???Good wine
4
This place locates at Art House but next to Clark Quay had great night view. The pizzas are great and great variety of spirits to choose from. Live band with dedication starts at 8.30pm daily. It is a great place for gathering to chill out after a day
5
They have huge outdoor area and local bands playing, then it's too loud and more festive mood. Local youngsters come here to listen to music, play table games and drink relatively cheap for SG beer. I prefer to come, when it's not crowded, then pizza here is one of the best in town, cheap, thin crost and crunchy, lots lots of cheese

Visited timbre with my friends as a form of gathering, just to catch up. One of our favorite places to hang out, because we like the ambience there, the arts house would be the best compared to their other outlets. Very nearby Clarke quay and many other nightlife spots.The beers are all averagely priced and not bad. In terms of the food, my friends and I will always buy truffle fries and their duck pizza. Top hit I must say. Worth the value as well. Buffalo wings a must try too. Not the best, but not bad.Local life band playing and there could be song dedication as well, occasionally a birthday celebration will be held there, and the band may or may not invite the birthday girl/ boy on stage. Depends. And the staff there are all friendly, willing to help out. Awesome placeOnly downside would be if you do not have prior reservations made, be prepared to queue for quite awhile. Depend on the time that u arrive and the number of people in your group
1
This bar/restaurant is in a prime location but serves poor food with worse music. You wonder that The Government couldn't find a better tenant for what is such a prime spot, especially with the renovation of the historic colonial district, which is now close to being finished
5
Went with a group of friends for an early christmas dinner and gift exchange celebration. We ordered their famous half n half pizza and chicken wings and also the portobello mushroom sides. It was heavenly. One of my friend tried the pasta in a jar, and she was particularly choosy as she wanted just prawns and no other seafood inside it. The kitchen was kind enough to prepare it specially for her. It seem like a busy night as well. But all was worth the queue and wait.Things to try if you are a fan of truffle fries and chicken wings. Pizza flavour: Duck is the best! We tried goodfella cos we wanted to also support the local band representing that flavour but it was really not to our liking (sorry)A great place to chill with a live band playing almost every evening and great company, what else could you ask for?Everything can be ordered or done by the ipad, hidden under the table. So be ready to tap away and select your order.cheers
4
When we arrived there was a massive line and it took quite some time to get in. Once at a table we order a few starters which were good, followed by two pizzas which were great. The atmosphere and location of this restaurant are amazing.
4
Must have pizza is the half half, Roasted duck plus seafood and a serving of Buffalo Wings when hanging out with mates at Timbre. One of the best service crew amongst the restaurants/pubs in downtown, always enjoy going back there to dine and wind-down.
3
The place is OK... HIghlight was the band that were playing live, they were really good.
We had to wait quite a long time for the food, and also to order few drinks, it was a mess... but once served, everything was fine
5
I love this place; order pizza and drinks on your ipad; enjoy live music from local talent and the company of strangers. Great place to relax by the river after a hard days work. A must.
5
It's a perfect setting to dine out with friends on a Friday night . Overlooking the river , with the live band the ambience is very good . The food is good however has limited vegetarian options. The staff is helpful and do suggest customised dishes.
2
Nice place for a chillax.Go for duck pizza and buffalo wings...If u see a waitress name Ling, flee!!!!It wasnt my best experience. Not her fault that management didnt hire sufficient people but a job that in the service line needs 1 less sulky person
4
I really like their roast duck pizza, it's a really tasty dish! This place is a great place to chill and chit-chat with your friends at night. But if you were to chat, don't sit too close to the band as they can get pretty loud. I like how you can request for a song and dedicate the song to your friends or someone special. There isn't much service here, maybe because this place is designed to be semi-self-service as there are ipads for each table to order your food. Overall I enjoyed coming here with no regrets
4
I always try and visit for dinner whenever I am in Singapore. The live music is usually very good and the place seems to always be full of locals enjoying a night out. All drinks and food are ordered via an Ipad attached to each table, which works well. I recommend the duck pizza
3
When will restaurant owners and managers in Singapore learn? Offering decent food won't be appreciated by customers if the service quality is mediocre. Great location, relaxing live music, decent food and yes lousy service. Self service water? Only in a canteen. And certainly not at these prices. Fix the service please.
4
We arrived at Timbre on a Friday night. Originally, we tried to get an outdoor table at the main Timbre restaurant, but all the tables were filled in anticipation for the live music and there was a sizable queue. After a bit of standing, a waiter offered to escort us to a table at "Barber Shop by Timbre" in the same building. This was their Jazz/Blues-themed eatery. It's a small space, but well laid-out and nicely decorated. It does a good job of channeling a jazz bar in downtown Chicago. The band that night was a cover band that took requests. We had to move tables at one point as it gets too loud to hold a conversation if you're seated in front of one of the ceiling-affixed speakers. Even after the move, we still had to shout a bit.The food was great, if not a little expensive. The duck pizza is one of their signature dishes and they have other specialty pizzas on the menu. However, the service is slow. It took a while to get someone's attention and longer still to get any drinks or food. Still worth the experience, but don't come if you're not willing to wait
2
we went on a recommendation. food and service were really rough, and the music was loud and, with all due respect, rather poor. we've travelled around the world listening to music and this was just not that interesting. all that said, prices were off-the-charts expensive.
4
A tad pricey but good ambience with excellent live music. Good for having a good time chilling out and catching up with friends
5
we had draft beer, veggie pizzas were superb, music was nice, all this, by the river!! With rafffles place infront of you, what more could i have asked for. perfect place to chill before you head to one altitude.
3
Last night we we went to Timbre to see an artist from Perth perform. She was fabulous. Unfortunately the service was woeful and it took 45 minutes to receive my bottle of sparkling water. I do not like ordering from an iPad. You have no idea if they have actually relieved your order or not
4
I came to Singapore getting greeted by friends and they took me to the restaurant to chill. There are a few outlets here and there in Singapore but the one we came to (Timbre at the Art House) definitely has the best view according to my friend. The restaurant is located at the Central Business District, along the riverside and right beside the statue of Stamford Raffles - founder of Singapore. The ambiance is pretty cosy and people usually come in groups to chill. Interior setting includes high tables and chairs, mostly outdoor, with lim lighting and an ipad to place orders for each table (which I found interesting and more convenient compared to calling out to the busy waiters)We order duck pizza and seafood pizza. Both are good! I especially love the duck pizza and it has a mixture of oriental and western flavor, plus the duck meat is tender too.At around 9pm plus there will be live music and the bands only sing English songs. It was a good time chilling and catching up with friends. And you can always request a song via message to the band
3
Visited Timbre at the substation last week and Timbre at The Arts House today. The one at Arts House is a little more pricey, but has a great view right in front of singapore river and the environment looks more high class compared to substation. Drinks are alright...the duck pizza is delicious. Great for those who love live music
3
We have had Christmas Eve dinner there but was nothing planned from ahead of time. We just did a tour of marina bay and this place looked like the best from around. The live music was quite good. The service was OK but I was annoyed by having them giving me the bill as soon as the order came. We did not asked for it but they brought it and insisted with irrelevant questions like: what are we paying with and when. We were hungry!!!!! Why bother me now with this?The toilets were very dirty and I was not expecting this in such a place. They could do much much better in keeping them clean.The prices are high but this is Singapore. We paid like 100 SGD for 2 people: 1 tapas, 1 platter, 1 cocktail and one beer.The best of all is the view on the Singapore river
3
Timbré is a good place to listen to live music and hang out with friends. The main downside is the food quality, which is incredibly poor by Singapore standards. So my advice would be to eat first then come down to Timbré for beers and live music..
3
Nice location on the riverfront but service was nothing special, not bad but not good.A bit on the pricey side but still similar comring to others in the area.Cocktails around 16S$ and beers 12-18S$music was ok, but they had very limited selection, so after an hour the band started playung the same set again... Maybe we were just unlucky..
2
This used to be a great place with quality live music, its since gone down hill morphing into an open mic house. The location promotes new talent but I've not seen anything worthy of being hailed as talented for a long time. Food is average snack type and the drinks ok. At weekends its a nightmare getting served in the evening heightened by the chronic bands performing. If you like covers of Alanis Morisette and the Cranberries in the style of Joni Mitchell this place is for you
