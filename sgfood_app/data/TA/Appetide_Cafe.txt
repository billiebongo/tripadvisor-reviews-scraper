the nasi lemak sets here are rather decent, good nasi lemak chilli and piping hot deep fried chicken wings. a rather simply furnished diner, with only 1 server, but a nice quiet place to chill.

Great drinks, snacks and desserts to have while enjoying the view of the Singapore River. For those craving local flavours, try their nasi lemak and must-have nasi lemak burger!
