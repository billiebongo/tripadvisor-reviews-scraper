It's rare to find good mee goreng in Singapore. Firm fried noodles, tinge of spice and lots of flavour. I was really surprised by how good their version is. The teh tarik was good too.

Hits the spot. I usually order the kosong prata, curry chicken and mee goreng. Service is fast, can stop here before going to the zoo.

Good and crispy Prata, efficient service, this place never disappoints. The one at Thomson is a tad crowded though. Try the one at MacPherson!

Predominantly a prata menu, this place has a chaotic feel when busy and it’s difficult to know what’s happening with ordering and no one person is your service person. The usual order for us is thosai and it’s good. The drinks are not the biggest asset of this place so order wisely.

The food is unhealthy. The place is packed. The service so-so: why is this place so full? Everyone feels they can sin a little after a hearty run. There is nothing more local than enjoying Prata for breakfast on a weekend. They have so much variety for Prata. Service is actually quite okay. This is certainly the place to come to experience something local.

I have been here before and couldn't remember whether it was okay or not so ventured again on a Sunday night to find the place scarcely populated; possibly more staff than customers. The service was very fast, but it was difficult to get a smile or engage with the wait staff who just lounged around the tables and benches on their phones. The place was open and just clean, but the chairs fabric had food stains and the tables looked roughly wiped down.We are quiet the Thosai / Dosai eaters so my kids know their Indian food group well and were happy to see a long list of combinations of Thosai, but really just wanted wat they usually have egg/cheese thosai. It was okay but the batter was too soft on theirs and my masala dosai was burnt on more that 30% of the surface so had a burnt taste overall.I wasn't happy with it, but ate it anyway.We order lassi which was ridiculously sweet. I had to order twice as they bought out the wrong flavour (strawberry instead of mango) which they guy wasn't at all interested as to why I had to reorder the drink.No napkins in a finger eating restaurant I thought was a bit of a short cut. Overall, if you can eat somewhere else I would, but I won't be going back again in any hurry. I felt like I was a difficult imposition on the staff being there.We spent $35 on 4 dosai (1 masala, 3 egg/cheese) , one cheese prata (horribly over oily), 1 lime juice, 3 flavoured lassi

Roti Prata, which is made with flour, salt, sugar and water, originating from Pakistani, is eaten either with white sugar, curry, condensed milk or just plain as it is. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the place to go to for this Indian Pratha was Jalan Kayu. Having it’s origins here, Casurina Curry Restaurant was started in 1992, and is a second generation Indian and Pratha shop. Already famous at it’s Casurina Road site, they started a second branch at Macpherson Road, and a few months ago, opened a third outlet called Casurina Curry at 20, Sixth Avenue, Singapore 276479.This new eatery and catering service outlet is not hard to find. They can be seen from the main road, and if you’re parked at Guthrie House, they’re just across the road. Opened from 7 am to 12 am from Mondays to Sundays, the place is never empty of customers. We went there at 7.45 am on Sunday, and there were customers already finishing off their pratas! Seating is either indoors or outside. We sat outside as it was cold indoors and we wanted to avoid our clothes smelling of curry! The ambiance is typical of a coffee shop, with food behind glass counters, and behind this, a long stainless steel table where the pratas are cooked. Besides the over 40 varieties of pratas to choose from, yes over 40 varieties, there are also other Indian food like fish head curry, chicken, fish and mutton briyani, masala chicken, mutton, fish etc. Their menu is online on their web site for telephone orders and for catering.Getting back to our breakfast meal of prata. We had the Paper prata and Egg prata. The Paper prata was crispy, paper thin, light, and not oily. The Egg prata was also well made. The curry sauce is tasty, not too spicy and not too thin, with the right amount of acidity. We washed these down with hot teh-tarek! We have twice before also tried their chicken briyani and masala chicken. Both are very good. The taste, quality and quantity is value for money!Service is fast, polite and accommodating. Payment is expected when the food comes. The place is wheel chair friendly. No WiFi. Parking when not available along the side roads, is best done at Guthrie House.Catering services are offered for office functions, home parties, birthday parties etc. They were the first to offer prata cooked on-site at your doorsteps! Minimum number of persons is 30 with prices ranging from $8.00 per head for a vegetarian meal, and from $11.00 to $18.00 per person for the normal spread. In the time we had breakfast, we saw at least three people walking out with take-away orders.Casurina Curry at Sixth Avenue looks all set to be a popular place, and we’ll be back for their famed fish head curry...soon!Address: 20,Sixth Avenue, SIngapore 276479.

Been there a couple of times with friends and is very crowded on weekends as it is a popular place for Indian food like prata and biryani.The roti prata is rectangular shaped and comes with spicy veggie curry. The plain ones are more crispy while the onion with eggs pratas are more tasty. The biryani comes in generous portion of fragrant biryani rice and served with options of beef, mutton, chicken or fish. Roti prata is the preferred choice for breakfast or brunch while biryani is taken as lunch or dinner.Highly recommend to complete your meal with teh tarik ("bubble tea") or teh halia ("ginger tea with milk") instead of normal tea or coffee

Causarina Curry Restaurant use to be serve very good Indian local food. They serve a cold food. The taste dropped very badly and their tea is also taste very horrible. I'm very disappointed with their service, they should do something about it. At the counter they place few donation box, normally my husband and myself will be donate some cash if we see such donation box. It is something like collecting money for re-opening of a Hindu Temple(Kumbabisegam) the donation box shows a temple re-opening in 2011 and THEY ARE STILL COLLECTING MONEY

The outlet offers a good range of prata to satisfy yr different taste sensation. Carpark is limited and the restaurant is always crowded. The prata is tasting and the wait staff are fast to take yr order. Oh they are fast to ask you to go once you gave finished your foo

The prata at this place is below average. The curry is spicy but tasteless. The coffee too diluted. Tea just tasted of milk....and the worst part - we found a short black hair sticking out of the dough...yucks!

The prata and the rest of the food has lost its shine. Standard has dropped as well as the table setting outside the shop. I definitely won't be eating there anymore.

Only tried the place once and I like their chicken briyani. Makes me want to go back to try more on their menu. The place can get crowded on weekday noon so just prepare to wait.

This place serves roti prata which is quite unique to Singapore. In Malaysia, it is known as Roti Chanai. This restaurant has experimented with many different variants of prata and be sure to try them (e.g. paper prata, chocolate prata, strawberry prata). And of course prata goes best with a nice hot mug of teh tarik. Enjoy!

This is a casual dining option near the Pierce reservoir. Many more locals than tourists. Service was great. Food was very good but there are many great restaurants in Singapore, so I wouldn't make a special trip out there just to visit this one. Nevertheless, I would go again if in the area

I like the Roti-Parata and currey Mutton. Also, Milk Tea! This is the best Roti-prata resturant in Singapore! Many kinds of Roti-Prata in this resturant! Why nice? The Roti-Prata is "tin" an Crispy. You can choose Fish, mutton or Chicken curry. Not so spicy! Yummy ! Yummy ! Yummy !

Roti prata at its most crispy best. Forget Jalan Kayu, this may be the best in Singapore!

Prata is crisp and "biscuit" type. The mutton curry here is good! but not my favourite prata establishment though.
