The quality and consistency of the noodles and taste here is very good. Whichever outlet I go to, I get the same yummy taste to satisfy my noodle craving.

I usually have their fried chicken noodle but surprised to see the new dish which is black pepper duck. The duck is slightly salty but it is delicious. I always come back at least once a month.

Went before previously, however this time round its a bit too salty. The chicken chop is crispy & juicy. Its quite crowded but the turnover is fast, its easy to find seats.

if you are craving for spicy noodles sarawak type, do visit this place. I do love their chili! they also serve abalone noodles which slightly more expensive

I saw them add the white power item in my noodles that look like MSG when I ask the staff what is that item they refuse to answer me.

In general the noodle are nice and tasty, but the price is expensive. There are better noodle out there.

This review is getting a good rating.This bowl of gold kolo mee is not cheap at $9.90 but is well compensated by the amount of ingredients- prawns, wantons, char siew, minced meat, vegetables and abalone slices. I love the chilli as it went really well with the mee and the variety of ingredients

Due to rushing to USS for Halloween night, we had a quick dinner in this restaurant. This restaurant is crowded and you have to go to counter to order and make payment first. We have ordered the smoke duck and fish kolo noodle. The serving is fast though crowded, the noodle is nice though in small portion, a bit oily as well. Nevertheless, the noodle still taste good and springy, definitely will be back to try on its other menu again. Highly recommended

Have been eating here quite a few times and like it for the food quality, quick and friendly service, nice ambience.Always order the No.1 gold option, kolo mee with abalone, four or five slices in a bow of soup with two wonton a couple of shrimps. The shrimps are the only items I'm not fond of, obviously frozen and tasteless, but everything else is great. The mee is springy and aromatic with bits of fried lard, a couple of bak choy stalks, plentiful char siew done natural without too much red coloring, minced pork. At $9.90 it's a filling meal but you can upside with $1 more of the excellent mee. Pickled red and green chilli if you're not satisfied with the very good chili paste at the table.However, there are plenty of other options, roast duck noodles, curry chicken, wanton noodle soup etc, and a variety of drinks.You pay and order at the counter but they'll bring it to your table, and there are always nice Malaysian uncles to welcome and seat you! Like the decor too, kampong style with comfortable side seats and stools with floral designs

Visited the outlet at Marina Square for lunch today with colleagues. Noodles are ok but if your benchmark is Kuching then you'll probably be disappointed by this place. On the plus side the service was very efficient and there were no issues getting a table.

Price is on the high side, but food is reasonable good, a little different from what we had in Kuching
4
have visited the shop multiple times, the branch located at Marina Square. fried fish fillet with noodles, the premium noodles @9.90 with 3 slices of abalone, curry chicken are all delicious.

This one is in my must visit restaurant while in Singapore.
Love the wonton.
Nice noodle and also the price is acceptable.

It has been many months since we visited the restaurant. We came back and order their char siew noodle and Fish soup. The tastes are good and really bring us back to authentic sarawak noodle. Really good service and efficient. But some waitress does not speak English. Nevertheless it is ok. Will come back other tim

Talk about bad food. If you even consider this food. With some good sense you should know that the noodles are not even cooked. If you think serving half cooked noodle is a Malaysian style, then I can tell you I had never tasted anything as bad in my decades visiting Malaysia. Not even those RM 2 road side ones, which by the way was really good. So in a sense, this store really put a bad name to Malaysia. About the taste. Beside than the noodle being terribly, the soup is also a nice bowl of pepper powder. Just not sure if its deliberate to cover up some taste or otherwise. The portion is terrible for which you can have a nice steak or fish and chips just at the food court beside it in Vivocity, which is very likely going to taste better too. The chashu is probably the only I can't complain other than too little. The wanton is small, of which you would expect from sgd3 a bowl noodle bit certainly not a restuarant like this. Taste was not really exceptional and the uncooked noodle ruined it all. I did not take the chilli, but maybe if you do, it might masked all these issues.Got good money to waste, try this. Otherwise there are a lot more cheaper and better food around in Vivocity

We just visited this restaurant without any info. We actually looked for lunch at Kopitiam but came across with this restaurant just before the entrance to it. A lady master invited us to an available table and had several different noodles together with fried wanton. All the noodles as well as the side were all great. We truly enjoyed the food at this place. The price of noodles are not that cheap, $8 or so but we found it pays. Please try. We will revisit this place soon

My local friend recommended this place to me and it surely satisfied my appetite for soup noodle. I even also tried their wonton mee on my visit and the wonton did not let me down. The service was quick and they did not miss anything good. One of the clean and tasty Malay Chinese style noodle shop in SouthEastAsia I would recommend

I visit this place regularly and their Kolo Mee surely one of the best i ever taste. It don't come cheap but still affordable to eat once in awhile. The normal Kolo Mee is always my preference. Good and fast service make this place my first option to fill up my tummy within short time (specially if you have movie to catch)

Very rare that i would eat the same thing twice in a single trip but this noodle is one of the few exceptions. Tried it in MBS Food court and then again in this Vivocity branch. The latter branch has it all. Abalone (Canned but better than nothing), smoked duck, tiny pork lard cubes, and noodles cooked just perfectly, not too soft and not too hard. Very nice chilli sauce which is always an extremely important element to a chinese style noodle. Most complaints about this establishment is the price but please give me a break, most of others cheap favorites are too bland or too hard, too wet. I am Indonesian so I do like my noodle this way.
