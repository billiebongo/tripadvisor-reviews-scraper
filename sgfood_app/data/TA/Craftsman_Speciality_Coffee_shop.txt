Had the Craftsman burger and fries.. the beef patty was delicious with a generous portion of condiments. The salted egg yolk fries is a must try.. large portion too. The waffle of the strawberry valentine was very impressive too.

Slightly off beat and way off the major coffee chains corporate image ( in a very good way). Craftsman caught our attention and delivered fine coffee, lovely refreshing iced drinks and outstanding waffles.
Certainly beats the better known opposition.

Compared to the Starbucks around the corner this is more of a sit down cafe with bacon and eggs or pancakes. It doesn't open till around 9ish, but it's enjoyable and lots of choice. Big meal sizes. Coffee was great. Plus they served bacon. We ate here twice during our stay at the Swissotel Merchant Court
