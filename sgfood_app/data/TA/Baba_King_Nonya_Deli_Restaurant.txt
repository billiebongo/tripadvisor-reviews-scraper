The shop is closed since early 2015.
I came here a couple of years ago, and it's awesome.
Food and dishes were authentically Nyonya
Too bad it's closed for now... :((

Baba King is a great go-to for lunch in the Changi Business Park area.
The food is fantastic and the owner is a delight.
This place made me fall in love with Peranakan food - a definite must-try!

Once in a while we do head to this place, food is really good and tickles your tongue with the spice and gravy etc, try any thing from the menu and it would be good.

It's a crying shame this guy is located out at Changi in what's predominantly an office worker area because the food here is fantastic and deserves to reach a MUCH wider audience!A word first about the owner - never have I had the pleasure of meeting such a genuine, sincere chap who truly loves his culture and food. Great fun to listen to and learn from.The food is absolute top notch too. The ayam buah keluak was superb, as was the devil curry, and even the lemongrass rice was a cut above the normal stuff. While it might be slightly more expensive than local hawker centres, the quality is certainly WAY better. Absolutely top notch and I'm so happy I've found this so early on, I think many a lunchtime will be spent at this place

We spotted that a new restaurant had opened on Kingsley Park Terrace and thought we'd give it a go. It happened to be only its third night open but I'm pleased to be able to give it a very positive review.If you've not had Malaysian food think spicy Thai/Chinese fusion (I've probably insulted Malaysian cuisine now)The service was excellent, the food was excellent (good quality and generous portions) - we will definitely be going bac

We tried this out of curiosity during one of our weekday lunches and found it to be very good. The service is good, and the staff are sincere. This was our first taste of Peranakan food and we found it to be delicious! They have a good selection of vegetarian dishes apart from the usual meat and fish ones, and some nice set meals as well. A must-try for those working in Changi Business Park

The wonderful thing about eating at Baba King is the Baba King himself (let me talk about the food later); Philip Khoo, the owner, the Baba King, is a great conversationalist and he would drop by your table and talk and talk and talk you can never get a word in edgewise. Food-wise, the ayam buah keluak is really really delicious, and I also like the ray fish and the itek sioh. I guess to appeal to a larger cross section of diners in that area, Philip's restaurant serves no pork meaning some dishes traditionally cooked with pork are changed to have chicken as substitutes. To me, that's the only beef, otherwise it's a rather pleasant experience. It's like eating in the home of a good friend as Philip will bring you stuff from the kitchen that are being used for his family's own consumption - like a special sauce, or sambal or even a tad of XO cognac for your pulot hitam dessert. It's a nice place, but keeping the owner at bay while you eat may be challenging and telling him to leave you alone to eat lest the food gets cold tantamounts to rudeness. It's a good problem though

One of my favourite Peranakan restaurants in the region (Maleka included), run by a couple who have been passionately nurturing this business into not only a retail outlet but also catering and exporting of frozen Nonya food as far as to the USA. Used to be located at the Singapore Expo but has since moved into the present location at the Changi Business Park, so lunch time crowd on workdays can be heavy and it is closed on Sunday.Only the best ingradients are used and the owner seems to know most of his customers by name and usually moved around from table to table to chat with them. Ask and he will tell you anything from the traditions to the ingradients and the preparation that goes into each dish.You will find all the typical dishes like Chicken Buah Keluak, Beef Devil Curry, Chap Chye, Cincalok Omellete and many more here, but they are all cooked in just with the right combination of spices and fragrant that makes a heavy meal seems light.Menu is available online at: http://www.babaking.com.sg/menu.htm
