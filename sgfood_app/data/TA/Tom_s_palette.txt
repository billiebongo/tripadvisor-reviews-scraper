Tom's Palette's most famous ice cream flavour is Granny's Favourite--a yummy mix of chocolate in malt ice cream. Tastes much better than it sounds. Since I last visited 2-3 years ago, they've also taken the chance to improve their decor, which brightened up the ambiance.

I got tiramisu one scoop cone ice cream. It actually has Rum in it. Very tasty. Lots if unique flavors.

Will drop by from time to time for an ice cream fix! The recent Christmas flavours are great. Especially like the alcoholic Eggnog flavour.

We have visited this place with my wife for a quick dessert. It provides you a plenty ice cream flavors, some of them are really interesting, like kampong kuah and honey lavender. Their signature salted egg ice cream is pretty nice, but not mind-blowing. If you'll be somewhere nearby, visit this place

The stand in located in the back of Shaw Tower, not too near to much. We walked there from The Fairmont Hotel and were very pleased. The flavor selections seem to rotate frequently. You should try some of the flavors - there seemed to be a large range from delicious to "why would you make that into an ice cream flavor?" I found the alcoholic stout beer flavor to fall into the why did they make it category
5
Located inside of Shaw Tower in Bugis. So easiest to walk via Bugis MRT station.Unique taste of ice cream. I tried the red dates longan and nuts and such flavor. Taste really good. They have other unique flavors like luo han guo flavor and I saw that they do have waffles and some unique selection of hot tea.This place have tables and chairs to seat in and also water are provided just by the side of the cashier. Would definitely go back again
5
I was not disappointed. You can taste the different flavours before chosing. Staff are very friendly and the ice cream (pear walnut and apple pie) was amazing. I also tried parmesan cheese flavour.They also do waffles and offer courses to learn how to make ice cream. Will be back before I leave

I have tried so many flavours here but I always go back to lavender. Delicately perfumed and subtly bittersweet (it's a herb, after all) but nonetheless delightful. Call ahead if lavender's what you are after as I have made treks to Shaw Towers only to be disappointed! Once my new freezer is in, I am going to order a pint or two so that I can liberally dig in whenever I want

Tom's Palette was a place that my partner and I chanced upon a few years back when we were still students. Ever since, we have brought various groups there for ice cream and they brought their own groups and the list goes on. The ice cream is cheap, decent and most importantly, unique. My partner loves the chocolate sorbet and granny's favourite while I personally prefer the alcoholic (any one) ice creams and have a sweet spot for the sizzling ice cream (forgot the name!)The place has also went through various revamps and change of staff. Will always drop by to scratch the itch that never existed till Tom's Palatte

We were just exploring our neighborhood and noticed this creative ice-cream makers in an old mall. But damn they got crazy ice cream tastes like Parmesan and salted egg yolk! We had the Earl Grey which was very tasty and not too sweet.
Will return

Their ice cream flavours are very different from normal ice cream shops!!
I love trying out their new flavours each time!!
5
Try the Horlicks + Salted Egg Yolk. They'll ask you if you've tried it/know it...but it's sooooooo worth it. Afternoon yumminess x10!
5
Never fail to visit this place whenever I am around the area.
There are many flavours to choose from and you can always try before ordering. They come up with a new flavour every month if I am not wrong.

The best ice cream shops in the world are those with waitstaff which are eager to have you taste their delectable ice cream flavors and encourage you to consider combinations off flavors.Tom's Palette is the most friendly, natural ice-cream shop in Singapore with very reasonable prices, unique flavors and exceptionally friendly and efficient service. I live on Beach Road and walk twice a week to Shaw Tower for the experience of interacting with the delightful waitstaff and to discover new flavors. I am never disappointed and always walk away being reminded of the simple things and pleasures in life. A great ice cream shop to take your family, friends, significant other or just yourself

I am not a big fan of ice cream but my husband is and we happened to go to shaw towers to watch a movie and saw toms pallete we went in grabbed a ice cream I dint want to take but its just 3.90$ for a small cup where u can mix two flavours and I thought why not.. later I ended up eating the entire Icecream for the first time ever :) it was yumm yumm loved it.. Best place for tasty icecream ;

Always a good selection of creative flavors with new additions regularly added. Must try the salted caramel cheesecake and lavender special.Or how about being adventurous and go for the salted egg yolk.All ice cream is made locally and super fresh. Forget the overpriced imported brands and go local.Free tasters are provided to help you make the choice a bit easier, or the desire to try more stronger.
5
My holy grail! Kudos to the team that came up with finger licking flavours. I'm totally obsessed with the savoury crunch flavour and their famous chocolate one. My office is just steps away from the shop which made it harder for me to not stop by every other day.try the salted egg yolk flavour and the gorgeous salted caramel too. Cheap, good and conveniently located in front of a very good thai restaurant - ah loy thai. Why not? :

A homegrown brand that truly listens to its patrons, while coming up with interesting combinations and flavors.Tom's Palette has a wide array of flavors that will cater to any taste bud. From the unusual Chocolate stout, salted egg to the conventional chocolate ice cream.With Singapore's weather being so hot and humid, the ice cream here is a welcomed respite from the searing heat
5
They have many various homemade ice cream and it all just taste so right that I will come back for more.

We felt so lucky to find this little place. They serve lots of unusual flavours and it tastes great. During our stay we visited twice and noticed that on the second visit they had new and different flavors. This really is a must visit place.

It has been a while, it has been too long. At long last, we made it back. While my daughter, now seven years old, managed two cups ("Melt and Sizzle" pure), I managed to sample more."Milk Punch", a new flavour, is made from milk, chai, lemon and rum- it is really a very cold, very very tasty cocktail. Outstanding, I hope this will become a standard. "Parmesan cheese and cream crackers" has been around for a while, still great. So is "Savpury crunch", potato chips in milk ice cream, the two go well together. So does "honey and cinnamon" with "banana choc" and "caramel stout" with the milk punch.One of the recent reviewers was not as smitten with this place as I have been for so long. I wholeheartedly understand and share the arguments he brings forward- "unusual flavours" and texture. Where I don't follow him is in applying this to Tom's Palette. Today, for example, there were several traditional flavours such as chocolate and strawberry. I tasted the latter, I am not such a fan of this flavour, and it was very natural, not the overly sweet and artificial taste you get in most places. On other days, I have tasted pistachio and hazelnut flavours, each exceptionally intense with little nuts left inside. As for "lavender", well it is a blossom you eat there which has the taste of, for example, bath soaps (minus the soapy taste) or those little sachets grandma put between the laundry- this is how lavender smells, this is how it should taste. Other than my own mother's homemade lavender ice cream, Tom's is the only place where I have had such intense flavour. I think this is a sign they aren't stingy with the ingredients. As for the texture- the boss explained to me that his ice cream uses less sugar and less fat by about 30% compared to the big industrial players, and cools down lower to get the texture as it is. Personally, I like it, as it is not as gluey as most other places. So if you scoop a spoonful, you scoop just that and not a long thread of sticky stuff dangling below.Ultimately, we vote with our feet. Today, on a public holiday at 5pm, the place was full. Same on some Friday nights just at closing time- a great vote for a great place

A work colleague and his wife brought me to this place one Friday after dinner. There were many flavours to choose from, but the flavour selections were not my cup of tea- they were too unconventional. The salted egg yolk ice cream was very rich and it was difficult to finish an entire cup of it - then there were others like Japanese Yuzu (tasted too lemon-y), lavender (tasted like Kiehls Midnight Recovery Concentrate - I'm serious - if you use this essential oil you will know what i mean), honey and cinammon (too dull). Overall, I didn't find anything spectacular about this place and the ice cream texture and taste was not my cup of tea
4
A wonderful and amazing experience. I've never imagine that a Salted Egg Ice Cream would taste really good!! They have a lot of unique flavors to choose from and the good thing is you can try them first!! I settled for the Flavor of the Month which is green tea with blueberry and coffee cream cheese :-

Sometimes, revisiting a favorite place can lead to gross disappointment. Tom's palette, by contrast, ist still as good as ever.I went twice last week- once with my six years old daughter, once on my own. My daughter enjoyed it so much she went for seconds, which is very unusual for her (yes, even with ice cream). So did I, and between the two of us on these visits we got to sample quite a few tastes.Unbeatable is "Melt and Sizzle", cherry infused milk ice cream (would be my guess) with cherry bits and chocolate chips. As such, similar to "Cherry Garcia" by one of the big international brands. The clou, however, lies in the detail of the chocolate containing those fizzy pops we all loved as kids (and still do when we get them), so that you have this amazing crackling feeling in your mouth as you eat it.Great, as always, are the slightly more savory tastes, the nutty ones (very intense hazelnut or pistacchio flavors), as well as the new flavors "cinnamon and honey" and "mango, passion fruit honey".Of course, the staff are as lovely as always- when certain politicians talk about improving service quality, rather than just providing more helpless, untrained staff, they should look at Chronos for advice- all his staff are excellent, helpful, knowledgeable and contribute to making this visit a pleasant experience.We can't wait for the next time

Tom offers truly homemade ice cream with a daily twist. In addition to the traditional Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla flavors Tom loves to experiment and the results can be quite interesting. And you are more than encouraged to taste-test them all yourself. I loved my Lavender infused scoop, but try the Chili Chocolate or Granny's Favorite (a treat for malted milk ball fans). If you are familiar with moon cakes trying the salted-egg is a must. This adventure is definitely for those not wanting to just do 'the tourist route' and want to have a local experience while they are in Singapore and you will NOT experience sticker-shock

I happen to see this ice-cream shop when I dine at the opposite Ah Loy Thai Restaurant. It seems quite popular so I decided to give it a try. The good thing about this ice-cream shop is, you can mix 2 flavours with 1 price, this is just perfectly for me as I dun want to have 2 scoops but I want to try more.They seems started in 2005 but I never known until now. They have new flavour every month. Guess what I see on the menu? Salted Egg Yolk Ice-Cream, I din get that as I still feel quite strange(although I love salted egg yolk) with this new flavour, but the taste is quite ok. Will they come out with century egg version?I got myself Green Tea & Yuzu. worth to try out the ice-cream here
5
Salted egg yolk, apple pie, chocolate stout, mango sticky rice, I am talking about ice cream flavour that this shop offer. Crazy but true. Best of all it taste great. After impress by the flavour, I did a research and realised that they did a lot of research on ice cream flavour. Recently they created a sorbet which have no diary product but it was creamy and intense... How did they do it? Got to try chocolate sorbet, pistachio sorbet, salted egg ice cream. Will definitely be back for more...

While waiting for the Thai restaurant next door to open, the wife and I could not resist trying the ice cream on offer at Tom's palette. A few weeks ago, I had noticed they had lavender ice cream, and as I had never had that in a commercial place (we used to make it at home when I was a kid), I wanted a try.Now that was the only disappointment of the day: no Lavender ice cream this time. But we tried about eight flavours each, from the normal (rum raisin) through special normal (white forest) to unusual (salted egg). Apart from some standards, more special tastes are offered in season (hence the lack of lavender on offer). Their webpage shows what flavour is up next.Each and every scoop we tried we found to be extremely rich in flavour. There was no hint of artificial enhancers/ artificial flavours in the taste. The staff/ owners were very knowledgeable and keen to help with our choice. E.g. there were two different flavours with cherry taste- one being the "white forest". I was advised to try out the combination of my choice first, and followed their suggestion to abandon one cherry taste for the other, as that would be better in combination.This is the first time staff in an ice cream parlor actually seems to care about their clients' choices. I felt treated as if I was at a five star restaurant, with sommelier etc. This was truly a wow experience.All ice cream is served two flavours at a time, with price a function of bowl size
