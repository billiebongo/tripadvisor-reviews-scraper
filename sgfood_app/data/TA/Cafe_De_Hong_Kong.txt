Recommended by a friend so we went there for a friend's farewell. Food and service overall is quite ok. This restaurant seems has more crowd during dinner time.

This restaurant checks the boxes for service, quality of food and price value.
Owner was on hand to recommend dishes and was patient and informative.
Every dish was excellent as with many prior experience. Looking forward to my visit next month.

Had a divine French Toast for dessert and wash down with the "ying-yang" coffee/ tea. The french toast was topped with butter and honey. I would have ordered another plate if not for the silent warning of my cardiologist.

This shop is awesome, very nice and value for money especially the lunch set.
The shop is not fancy but in fact a bit run down

Cafe De Hong Kong in Balestier Road has awesome and good HK food with very reasonable pricing.
Pls park Jalan Dusun as it's easier and less than 3 mins walk .

There is no other place I would have meals in Singapore cooked in authentic HK style than at Cafe De Hong Kong. A humble interior lined with lovely artwork done by the owner’s young son in primary school, Francis hails from Hong Kong himself, and has managed to garner a strong following with a stream of regular diners at his joint. Familiar HK favourites like scrambled egg prawns, typhoon shelter crab, and even HK toast can be found here. One of my favourites is their freshly cooked scallops that only cost $3.50 each! You can’t beat that

We have been dining at Cafe De HK frequently for past 5 years, fell in deeper love with the food ever since new chef from HK came on board this year. We usually ask owner Francis to recommend daily special fish and seafood dishes which have never disappointed us. For wine drinkers, you can order a bottle of wine compliments fantastic HK cuisine here

Cafe De Hong Kong ('CDHK') is a hidden restaurant along Balestier Road in Singapore that served Hong Kong style Ci Zhar. The cuisine here represent the items that you can find in any typical restaurants in Hong Kong. In case you are thinking of Xin Wang or other HongKong cafe, they served different types of food. LD and I have patronised CDHK regularly and it has become our must go-to restaurant if we are looking for comfort food. It is those dishes that we had in Melbourne during our uni days. Soup is basically a must have for Cantonese and Hong Kong cuisine. In CDHK you should not miss out on their double-boiled soup of the day. Our last visit here, we had their Winter Melon Soup ($35). A good portion good for 6 to 8 pax. The soup is double boiled inside the winter melon. The broth is sweet and robust, good to warm up your stomach. They also have a smaller portion, just check with the service staff. Roasted Chicken ($34) is one of the signature dishes here. It is tender, succulent and the best part is the skin. It is paper thin and crisp. Absolutely delicious. To save on cooking time, you might want to order this during reservation. If you prefer something more traditional, order the Claypot Chicken with Salted Fish and Tofu ($18 for Large). This dish is not on the menu however you can place the order with the boss, Francis. The combination of salted fish and au jus of the chicken will whet your appetite, while the tofu just absorbs the flavour nicely. A good dish to go with rice. Lamb Brisket in Claypot ($26) is a dish that Hongkongers normally consume during winter time. We were surprised when we saw it on the menu here. We have been coming back for this ever since. The lamb briskets are stewed over long period with ginger, star anise, cinnamons stick, fermented beancurd and beancurd stick. The seasoning not only infused flavour to the lamb brisket, it also helps to neutralise any gamy flavour. After a few hours of stewing, the meat just falls off the bone. The beancurd stick absorbs the robust gravy, while the water chestnuts will add a crunchy texture to the dish. Yum Yum. Their shells dishes such as clams and lala can be found on their black board menu. We had La La Beehoon ($10.50) this time around. The bee hoon did well to absorb the sweetness and freshness from the La La. More of a subtle dish. For something spicier, try their Stir Fried La La ($12 for small). This version packs more punch as it is cooked with chilli. Not only the flesh is fresh, the gravy will make you suck the shell clean. Recently we tried their Typhoon Shelter Crab ($130, $65 per kg). For crab dishes, you will need to book in advanced. It is a dish that you will normally find in most of the restaurants in Hong Kong. This dish is very aromatic as the crabs are deep fried with garlic, scallion, red chilli and black bean. Showcasing the skill of the chef, the deep fried crab has a crisp exterior while the flesh retains their juiciness. As they use female crabs for this dish, the crab roe absorbs the aromatic flavour more than the meat of the crab. It was an appetising dish and a must try. Please note you must order this dish during reservation, as CDHK must order the crab in advanced. Not to be missed here is CDHK Fish Roe Fried Rice ($20 for Large). It has a nice wok hei, topped with evenly mixed fish roe that gives this fried rice the umami flavours and the crunchy texture in each bite. Our friend's kids love it so much we ever order 2 large portions to go with their Deep Fried Luncheon Meat Chip ($8) and Seasoned Porkchop ($16.50).For dessert, save some space for their French Toast ($6.30). A deep fried thick toast with peanut butter spread. Finished off with maple syrup and a slab of butter. The combination of crisp exterior and soft pillowy interior made it a perfect dessert after a heavy meal. Or you can have it for high tea as well. Each order of the French Toast comes with a drink, we recommend their HK Milk tea which tasted like the one you find in HK. I have to admit, it is one of the best Hong Kong French Toast you can find in Singapore. The décor of the CDHK is simple and no fuss. It is an air conditioned restaurant. Although there are seats outside, I hardly see people seating outdoor for their meal. Service efficient like a family restaurant. Overall, Cafe De Hong Kong is here to bring your traditional Hong Kong cuisine. The food is delicious and comforting, but don't expect five-star restaurant standard. Definitely, a must try place if you are looking for Authentic Hong Kong Cuisine. Cheers!

When E told me we would be dining here, I said yes with some trepidation given that Balestier is well known for budget type hotels and chicken rice eateries. Naturally I googled before coming and made up my mind what to order.When I arrived, the restaurant is like a little oasis set a little ways back from the main road. Parking is easily available just before or after the restaurant and well lit. The owner, a friendly HK native by the name of Francis, makes it a point to recommend their dishes. However E being a regular had pre-selected some dishes. We didn't get to try the seafood offerings but I would have to rate the meat dishes an 8. For starters the sar po fun (claypot rice) was excellent. The chef had opted to serve the rice separate from the meats so one could fully appreciate the fragrance of the rice without the greasiness of the preserved meats. The pork ribs were deliciously tender and garlic chicken lovely. I was careful not to overeat as I was saving room for their French toast. Wow it was awesome and boy was I pleased I didn't overeat unlike D who has somewhat of a bottomless pit. Only criticism I have is the use of margarine in lieu of butter.Needless to say,I am planning a return trip this weekend. 8/10 considering it's very affordable with no corkage for wines.
