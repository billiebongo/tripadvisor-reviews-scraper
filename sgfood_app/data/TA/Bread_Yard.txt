The food and coffee are both ok. There ia the option to mix and match the different ingredients on your plate, which gives customers flexibility in the menu. My grouse is that food servings are small for the prices charged.

I had lunch here and their food short of nothing than GOOD! It was affordable, nicely played and most importantly flavourful! Should be one place you go to have your cravings for a simple brunch !!

This is my 2nd visit to Bread Yard and this time I tried the make your own breakfast combo option where I picked what I want from a list of items eg number and style of eggs, type of vegetables, type of sauces, type and number of slices of bread, etc.. it was fun picking the items so you get exactly what you want but the prices are slightly pricey eg mushrooms cost $2/3 (can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recall exact amount) which is the price of a box of button mushrooms from local grocery store. I picked chicken, slice of ham, asparagus (the portion given was only 2 skinny ones), slice of bread and a sunny side up egg costs me about $14... not cheap but comparable to other cafe prices. The place is not crowded on weekends so you can hang around to catch up with friends but the ventilation is not great so the smell of food lingers on your clothes and hair. This place called themselves Bread Yard but the variety of bread that they serve or have available for sale is very limited, which was a tad disappointing.

Nice food and atmosphere. Due to the egg and salmon on the bread, it became very soggy after a while. In the future, I would ask them to separate the bread from the toppings first, so my toast stays toasted. Take note if you don't like soggy toast!If the prices were lowered slightly, I would visit more often

I visit Bread Yard at least once a week for breakfast before work and the food was amazing every time. I highly recommend the Pulled Pork Benedict from the All-Day Breakfast menu. The eggs were gooey, the toast was crispy and the pulled pork was moist and flavourful. The Croissantwich with ham and scrambled egg is good as well for a quick breakfast

This is my first time to bread yard but my friend has been here several times previously. She mentioned that the menu has changed and it now includes more breakfast options. We ordered the big breakfast and a pulled pork burger with tea and a latte. The burger was good and serving portion is decent for the price ($10) with a side of potatoes. The big breakfast was $15 and portions are reasonable though my friend said the scrambled eggs was below average. I find the charges that they charged for their food was reasonable and generally lower than the other cafes that we had patronized previously. They served the tea in a teacup and not in a pot ($2). Place was not too crowded when we arrived around 10.30am on a Saturday morning. It is self service where you order at the cashier and pick up the food when it is your turn. There is a make your own plate option where you can pick and choose what you like. We would probably come back again and try that. Overall, not a bad place to hang out if you happen to at One North area.

I've been here for lunch many times. The bread is great and the dishes are fresh and taste good. The only thing is that the prices are a bit steep for the portion sizes. Also, a burger with no sides/fries? Come on, it would cost next to nothing to include a small side with it. They added more space to the dining room which is great, and recently they added a mix-your-own ingredients option for a lunch platter which makes it more affordable

Breadyard serves the freshest bread, they are serious about the work they do-u can see their baking kitchen. some reviews comments too small a portion for price paid but I feel is worth every effort they give into baking & cooking everything fresh, you have to wait for yr delicious food while it is being prepared and you finish every single bit of it there's no wastage. Amy the friendly lady owner is passionate when you talk & get to know her. She will serve yr food to yr table whenever she is freed frm the kitchen so if you are lucky.I dine here 2-3 times a week after the gym, my fave is the smoked chicken on sour dough with freshly brew coffee sometimes I do only salad + add-ons, beside the classic menu they also hv a flexible menu where u can create yr own. Simple settings tuck in the corner of Fushionopolis serving food so good for yr tummy & yr gut.

Visited this place again to have dinner with a client. Originally we wanted to order from the brunch menu but that's not available after 4pm, so we settled for sandwiches from their Sandwich Menu; they have a dinner menu too, which are also sandwiches.We ordered the Duck and Orange Sandwich and Smoked Chicken Sandwich, each costs S$9.00.We were quite disappointed at what we got. The portions were small, compared to the sandwiches we've had from the brunch menu.While the bread did taste good (they bake their own bread), we felt that the amount of food we received were not worth the amount that we have paid.Our conclusion was that we should only come here for food from their Brunch Menu

The candied bacon and grilled cheese pancake was an absolute dream. My favourite part of it was the grilled cheese as it really gave this dish the extra oomph! The pancakes were very fluffy but the texture is unlike the ones of conventional pancakes; it's almost a bit like English muffins.We also had the Big Boy's platter which is a big breakfast that is big and good enough to satisfy any big breakfast cravings one might have.The interior of the place quite minimalistic but neat and clean. I would certainly come back if I ever go to Singapore again. Didn't get to try their bread pudding the last time
