I've read raving reviews about the martabak manis offered from this place. But I'll be honest, the bakmie ayam is actually the best one I've had in Singapore so far.
This place is very easy on your pockets as well, which is always a plus.

Nice little place for a quick lunch. Good to see Orchard Road still has places like this hidden between the shopping centers. Would visit again, and recommend anyone to do the same.

I visited this little cafe on my last day in Singapore. We came on vacation from Honolulu.I'm Indonesian and my wife is Filipina. Before our trip to Singapore, my wife told me she misses Indonesian martabak, so I googled it and found this cafe.We almost did not made it here, but on our last day we were in Orchard Rd., so my wife insist we go here to get the martabak.When we arrived, this little cafe was a full house. I started to notice that this little cafe is specializing in Indonesian quick bite like Bakmi Jakarta.So I placed the order for two regular size of thei mixed martabak to go as our snack at oyr hotel.While waiting for my order, I introduce myself to the cashier who happen to be the owner, and explain that I found his cafe from googling it on the net. While our order was being packed, out of nowhere the owner told me not to go right away because he wants me to try their Bakmi Jakarta. "It's on me, I want you to try it" he said. He even offered to top it iff with their Bakso (meatball), which I refused because he is already kind enough to offer a stranger free food.This kind of service is what you called bussinessman like service, not just the fact he is friendly, but he is also promoting his business. Kudos to him!!And trust me, the Bakmi Ayam is good!! The martabak for sure satisfied our craving.We wish him the best, and for sure we will come back, and send some friends there when going to Singapore

I grew up in Indo, and thus as an indonesian, I certify that they had used authentically imported ingredients from the sauce (kecap manis, cabe) , to the noodles, and siomay or betagor. The only lacking I find is the authenticity of the martabak. It lacks the oily butter-ly finish, and the size of it. However, so as to be able to distribute the ie to more people, a healthier choice version with smaller serving is good for an after-meal snack or dessert. SLuurrppz!

If you are craving for some Indo food like batagor and martabak, come down to Jtown Cafe in Orchard Rd. This is my second visit there and the food never fails. We had their Cabe Hijau Chicken Rice, Crispy Chicken Bak Mee sorry no pic for this as we were too famished by the time we break our fast. However, managed to capture the Batagor and Martabak before its goes down out tummy . Price is also affordable

I would strongly recommend this eating place. Its in the heart of Orchard Road and serves affordable and Yummy Food. Best time to visit is during their Lunch Promotion which is from 12 to 3 PM. It costs $6.50. You will get a main dish which you can choose from, 3 Bakso Balls in which you can choose if you want it Fish or Beef flavour and a Free Homemade Ice Green Tea. Other drinks can be topped up for 60 cents only.As this outlet is popular, it will be packed by lunch crowd, so the best time to visit is from 12 to 12.30 and after 2 PM

JTown Cafe is tucked at the basement of Midpoint Orchard. During lunch or dinner peak hour, the place can get quite crammed. Although there's no wait staff, the service was alright. It did not take long for our food to arrive. One of the staff was apologetic that she did not offer baby chair earlier.The menu consists of noodle dishes, siomay (steamed fish dumpling, tofu and vegetables served with peanut sauce), batagor (fried fish dumpling and tofu, also with peanut sauce) and martabak (sweet, thick pancake with various fillings).The noodle dishes were alright, although popcorn chicken noodle could be better with more sauce. Siomay and batagor consisted of exactly the same ingredient - except that it's steamed in siomay and fried in batagor, and siomay had some cabbage. The fish dumpling had more flour than fish paste, though, which was quite disappointing. Martabak campur came with chocolate rice, ground peanut, shredded cheddar cheese and condensed milk - alright, but I've tasted better.The drawback of this cafe is its bad ventilation. Looks like the place was not well equipped for deep frying or even cooking
