Great staff, very friendly - seemed like there were only female staff and nice feeling walking in. We had iced coffee and cappuccino.
5
Great coffee in a nice cosy cafe with friendly staff. Genuine coffee/express. Nothing can be better.
4
Pleasant, welcomng place for a proper cuppa. Ne of the more established, and indeed better, cafes I've been at around the Outram/Tanjong Pagar area.
5
I'm very picky with my coffee places but this little espresso bar is probably the best in town! Extraordinary friendly staff and a roastery on site makes it definitely worth a trip!
5
Tucked into the old neighbourhood of Everton park, nylon coffee roasters offers superb coffee at very reasonable prices. Watching the almost scientific obsession with roasting the coffee beans and sipping your cuppa, it's a great post lunch hang out.
5
The coffee is great and they have wide array of coffee beans to choose from. Their staff will happily give you recommendation on what to sell. They don't play around with their coffee bean knowledge, as I heard that they buy coffee beans directly from the farmer and regularly visit the farm. The also sell coffee gear for your needs. The location is a bit hidden within an apartment complex, yet it is not too hard to find
4
Located in a HDB, this is a neat little shop that only sells coffee. No cookies, no muffins nothing. Just pure and simple coffee. We had regular roast with milk, and an iced brew Guatemala roast. Flavor was slightly acidic, medium bodied. Great if you live nearby, just good if far
5
Well i followed tripadvisers recommendation that this was the coffee spot...and was certainly not dissapointed. I am a self confessed coffee nut and let me tell you...this place was in my ultimate top 5 coffees. The coffee was so good i ordered a second serving. This place is hidden...and only serves coffee. But if your a coffee nut like me...it is a crime not to visit this place. Make the effort!
5
Finally found what I was looking for.Having chased leads all over Singapore for great coffee, usually finding good coffee that shares the stage with food and alcohol, at Nylon, coffee is the only star.Quality beans roasted on site + skilled, efficient and friendly staff + the La Marzocco = great coffee.The espresso comes with thick crema and great mouthfeel, strong on berry flavours.Though a little tucked away for tourists to find, and not as large as would be ideal, this place is a gem that locals should treasure
5
Tried flat white and long black here, they are so nice, I will always come back. Staffs are very helpful and friendly, they make great coffee. I like this cafe, you're here just for the good coffee, nothing much. They serve only good coffee, no dessert, no meal. Had been trying other cafes, this one is on my top list in Singapore. If you are craving for good coffee, Nylon is the place you would like to visit. This place is located on the ground floor in the HDB, less than the 10 minutes walking distance from Outram Park MRT station exit G.
5
Unbelievable! Smart! Professional! Doing miracles with coffee beans! If you love coffee or think you love coffee Dennis & Jiamin will take good care of you at Nylon coffee!
5
I have just found this cafe on tripadvisor and decided to give it a go. This is a nice little place tucked away from the main business areas. The coffee was great and staff was extremely friendly. I can definitely recommend this place.
5
Well, the best coffee in singapore . Must a visit place for coffee in singapore . A hidden gem in singapore .
4
Popped in here today to see what the hype is all about. Hidden away inside Everton Park HDB, it's a surprisingly popular place for coffee connoisseurs. We had the lattes, which were decent and reasonably priced. Note that there's nowhere to sit.
5
This has been the best coffee that we have had in Singapore. Strong, creamy and not bitter. Certainly worth a visit for coffee lovers, note there isn't any food, only coffee.
4
Went there with friends who love coffee and who told me that this was one of the best spots in Singapore we were not disappointed! The staff is really nice and the coffee was delicious and different so it was a worthwhile experience. They roast their own coffee and the atmosphere is very nice. Would recommend a visit
4
Have heard this from several people. I don't know if it's true, but they do take their coffee seriously and specialise in it, which is great. So much so that you get only coffee here, nothing to eat as such. There is variety---when I went they had coffee from Kenya, El Salvador among other places. They do pour-overs; they have the regular long blacks and a friendly staff. They have no ambience, the place is located discreetly. It's strictly for coffee lovers and connoisseurs
5
I have had their beans before and I was mildly impressed, so I was excited to find out its location is within reached from the hotel I stayed in Keong Saik Rd. Googlemap made me go round a typical apartment building (Rusun type, my country fellowmen would understand) before I finally found it as it is rather hidden. But it is all worth it; the long black I ordered was excellent. The people here nice, they know what they're doing without being coffee snobs. I suggest you get their beans as well (check their roasting days to get the freshest beans).
4
They expert on brewing great coffee with home roast coffee from great quality of coffee cherry or beans. However their beans rotation not as frequent compare to other coffee beans roasted. So far I saw two season of beans this years.
5
Nylon is a no nonsense boutique coffee shop. The owners are coffee fanatics and can often be seen roasting their custom sourced beans in the back of the store, the coffee is excellent and the service is great. Don't expect fancy seating or smashed avocado, Nylon is all about the coffee
5
A simple, small coffee place that source and roast their own coffee. Friendly staffs who are ever ready to share about their coffee. Do be patience if you happen to be there during peak hour crowd as the space does get a little cramp.
5
Husband and wife "hole in the wall" outlet
excellent coffee from fundamentalists.
Little bit of advice, do not enter inside Everton Park to find them, as the unit opens from the outside of the park.
5
Few choice of drinks available but the quality of the drink is the answer to why the cafe is always pack. Would love to try their roasted bean one day.
5
Nylon serves the best coffee in Singapore. Period. Simple offerings of just black or white. The coffee is heavenly. The cafe is so simple that it just offers coffee and nothing else. I will definitely return for just coffee.
5
The place itself is a hipster cafe with various types of people visiting: families, hipster, couples, workers. Me and my husband came here as it has been recommended for us by other cafes in the East of Singapore who buy their coffee from Nylon Coffee as they have a roster also. Have ordered two filter coffee from different types and both of them were outstanding, high above the standards of a long black at any cafes in Singapore
5
This place is really hard to find but it is worth the hide and seek: they serve excellent filter brew coffee and other varieties as well from the freshly ground beans they roast themselves on the spot! Can buy the beans and the accessories to make your own as well!
5
You can tell when the people behind an idea have a real passion for it. Nylon serves probably the best coffee in Singapore. Their long black and flat white are amongst the best I have tasted. Their owners scour the coffee growing nations in a bid to find the best beans. The fact that there are many couples, hipsters and families with kids hanging out at Nylon is a testimony to how hospitable the hosts are.
5
My favourite hangout for the last 4 years, you can always count on Nylon to deliver consistent excellent coffee (by the way, they only serve coffee. With no fancy things like soy milk either). They dedicate themselves to quality coffee that shines on its own (at reasonable prices too! It doesn't get any better). A must visit for serious coffee drinkers
4
Nestled away in Everton Park HDB this cute little coffee shop serves up some great coffee. Makes sense since they roast the coffee on premises . For "coffee geeks"/aficionados I would say this is a must visit for Singapore. The one tiny quibble I have is that they don't have WiFi :
4
We visited this place today for coffees. We ordered 2 Flat White 5oz/7oz which both were quite light in aroma, acidity, body, flavor and aftertaste. I'm personally preferred my coffees stronger.. but the light one for change wouldn't be a problem for me either. The Barista and the rest of crews were polite and friendly which made it's a pleasant place.
4
In the middle of some HDB flats, with a in house Probat roaster. This place offers legit coffee. Coffee connoisseurs ... go!
4
The better ones among a clutch of cafes springing up around Everton Park. Honest, good coffee and a decent range of breakfast options. Someplace to be before hitting the office, if you're lucky.
5
So this place serves a purpose. Coffee. Iced, deep, espresso, filter. Drink in, take away or getting beans and supply. Consistent. Great. Definitely one of the best in Singapore. I wish they did food too though.
4
the coffee here is so good and affordable! the place is kinda in a hidden place but i guess it worth the trip to explore several cafe in everton park!
4
Best coffee I've had in a while with great service too! Baristas are knowledgeable too. Only downside is it was a little tricky to find
5
Nylon is serious about coffee and delivers a first class cup at a fair price. The Barristers are very knowledgable about coffee and the beans are roasted in the store. No food... just excellent coffee!
5
If you are in Singapore and you are coffee lovers, do not forgot visit the NYLON cafe. About the roaster we have heard Laos, in Vietnam, in Thailand, in Malaysia everybody who doing some serious coffee, told to us, if you will be in Singapore, sure visit the roaster. It is right small simple place, full of people passionate to coffee. You can get there as espresso base hot drink, or also drip coffee
4
This is a small hidden gem. It is hard to find but worth the adventure. The owners have a passion for coffee. Based on the equipment in the back room, they are big on experimenting with all coffee beans roasted in the store. The staff certainly know their stuff but are not over the top as they serve you. There is a tall bench inside to stand by but minimal chairs. Outside they have some structures to sit on. This does not detract from the place, in fact it makes the environment open and clean. It is more a meeting spot to chat and â€¦ enjoy the coffee
3
Somewhat hyped. But decent coffee nevertheless. Felt like a crime asking for some sugar though. The place is a hidden find, and the standing bar ensures people get out quickly or takeaway. Id have liked a sitdown for my cup of evening coffee #5ozwhite
5
What could you expected from a coffee made from freshly roasted beans in the store. Small shop space but often the shop is pack with patrons who enjoy and appreciate coffee. The after taste will still b lingering on your tongue hour after u drink the coffee
5
all good, all good. they only have black/white/filter on their menu. make a visit if you're calling youself as a coffee geeky, hihi.
4
I am a coffee lover and when it comes to coffee I know.. High quality coffee bean which is sourced from all over the world! Brilliant I say.
Such dedication I admire. Plus, they roast it themselves so can you fault that?
4
Read this was best coffee in Singapore and it's certainly amongst the best. The cafe is small with limited seating. However the staff are very knowledgable about the coffee they serve and happy to share facts if asked. Very hard to find the place though.
5
Went to Outram Park specifically for Nylon Coffee and was certainly not disappointed. Great coffee, fun environment, helpful and knowledgeable staff. What more could you ask for?
4
Less of a coffee shop, more of a coffee pagoda, with the staff monkishly obsessive about blends and roasts and provenance. Plenty of devotees, too. Well worth seeking out.
5
The very best coffee in Singapore. From appearance, temperature, scent, to taste, their coffee is just perfect. We even had it with no sugar at all. We bought 1kg of their beans to bring back home, they were delicious - "we highly recommend "Wot" beans. The place was a bit hard to find, but otherwise, it's perfect
4
Dropped by this coffee spot as was around the corner. Good coffee, but not the best that I have. Ambience is amazing despite it having no seats. "We only have four seats in the shop" so expect to stand or hang around. But the best part is, feel free to mingle around at the park outside while enjoying some natural breeze
5
This is my favourite coffee haunt every time I'm in Singapore. That said, this is strictly for coffee lover. The only things served here are amazing coffee by the equally passionate barista. Located within hdb residential area near outram park mrt, this little humble shop offer limited standing areas for you to enjoy your coffee.
4
Despite of a numerous new coffee shop openings in the area, Nylon is still doing well in serving high quality coffee. The baristas are quite friendly and really put effort in making your coffee.Since my home is a stone throw away, usually I take away rather than enjoy there; however, their standing bar looks perfect for gathering with your friends, or just making new friends with other cafeholic. Standing there, you might be able to see how they roast their own coffee as well
4
Big fan of coffee, but can't seem to find a decent one amidst the surging cafe bloom in sg. Nylon is one of the few that's exceptional. The place is small yet cosy and the owners are friendly. Doesn't cost you a bomb to get a nice espresso or a latte. kudos to the owners who source and roast their own beans.
5
Small place, few seats but great coffee. Nestled at Everton Park. This area is dotted with small cafes. Nylon comes up as a small roaster/cafe that serves what it does best.
3
Been here a few times for coffee after lunch. The store is nice and staff are helpful. The place is always packed so it's rare to find a seat and table space is so small you can't set more than a cup of coffee down anyway. They do roast their own beans, which are fair, but there are at least 3 other coffee shops in the same HDB, so it's hard to find something that really sets Nylon apart
5
Been in Singapore for about four years now, from a coffee loving country and spent time in the place where Nylon gets it's NY from (ask the kind owners about that).The couple that run this nice little place are smart, kind, and passionate -- and it comes out in their excellent, precise long blacks. A small, fun, noisy little space with a friendly vibe and a great smell, always good for an out-of-the-way cup
4
Nylon is a humble coffee shop. It is not your typical cafe selling desserts and a variety of drnks. Be prepared to stand around the table while enjoying your caffeine fix. If I am not wrong, this is the only place that sells Kalita coffee accessories in SG. For those keen on making coffee using the pourover method, the helpful staff will be keen to advise. Will be back for a cup of freshly brewed coffee!
5
Stumbled upon this little gem after sneaking around on a Café hop in this part of Sgp.Not sure what food/snacks/bakery they have as I arrived just before closing. But the coffee was superb. The crew working there were also very friendly pointing me in the right direction for my continued café crawl. If a good cup of joe is on your list and a bit of exploring, then make your way here and have a nice cup
4
I visited Nylon twice, once with a friend who was on a coffee hunt during her trip down to Singapore, and the second time with my wife. The service on both visits was OK, although I did had a better experience on the second time - the barista took the time to explain to me how best to smell the coffee (gently swirl it to let out the fragrance), which I appreciate.On my first visit, I tried their tiniest size of espresso + milk, but as I had a black coffee before I visited them, I couldn't really tell whether the coffee was good (my tongue was numb from bitterness), although my friend commented that their coffee had layers of taste and she liked it. On my second visit, I tried their espresso and it was the best espresso I had. I have read that good coffee doesn't taste bitter, and Nylon's espresso verified that for me. It packed a punch without the bitterness, and has a sourish taste that makes me want to keep sipping at it. My wife tried their 4oz. espresso + milk and she liked it too. She thinks it's a good balance of milk and coffee without having one overpowering the other.When you are there, you can see that they are really putting in the effort and you can see their laser-like concentration in brewing their coffee for you. However, if you are visiting and plan to sit down to have a long chat with your friends or partner, I won't recommend that, as theirs is a small space, enough for three to four person to sit/stand around, without a table.Head over there for the coffee, be prepared to stand (which works for me) if you are not the takeaway-type and savour your cup of coffee. It might just be the best espresso you will ever have too
5
Though the shop is a tad small, the coffee served is excellent and beyond compare.Seating area can be almost non-existent if there are 4-5 people within the shop. However, you can choose to sit on the wooden crates outside.Owners are very friendly people and they try to remember the regulars' names.Not a good place to sit/chill the whole afternoon but recommended for the coffee
5
On a vacation where my husband spent most of his time in training and I explored the streets of Singapore alone, it was such a joy to walk into Nylon and feel like part of the community. Nylon is a tiny cafe, with just four chairs, and yet patrons hung around enjoying good coffee and conversation. Owners Dennis and Jia Min, who are there most days, are hardworking and passionate about what they do. They source and roast their own beans, and I bought a bag of Finca El Zarzal to bring back to Melbourne (a place that is not short of fantastic coffee roasters). I look forward to visiting again next time I'm in Singapore
5
This really isn't a place for you to sit and chat with friends or enjoy the scenery. It's a small shop in an old neighborhood, away from the tourist trail, with nothing but coffee (though there is a bakery next door). But oh, what amazing coffee. The owners select, roast, and brew their coffee with a passion, and they'll happily explain why it's different from the ordinary stuff.If you're already an aficionado: this is the place that puts Singapore on the specialty coffee map. Do try it
2
Saw many positive reviews on the coffee online and decided that I must try it one day. So last week, when I was waiting for my dog to finish grooming at his groomer near Outram, I hopped over to this joint. Was expecting a really good coffee.Order a 5ounce and seriously? It was just so so.. Ok.. the coffee is smooth but that was all.. I was not impressed with the lack of flavor, aroma or acidity. $3.80 for coffee that did not even fill a small cup, I expected something better.I won't get my coffee here again. Toastbox's coffee is Much better so far, and YaKun serves my cup of tea ("Teh-C")
