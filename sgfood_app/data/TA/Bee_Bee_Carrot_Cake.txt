This restaurant is famous for the carrot cakes so i listed it into must-to-go places, and it was not disappointing me. The taste was very strange and sounded good. You must visit it for the carrot cakes

Tasty carrot cake store which became 'famous' after being mentioned as Joseph Schooling's favourite, haha! For a while after that, the queue was super long & they often sold out by mid-morning. Now that the hype has died down, the queue is shorter.The lady at the counter has super memory - so you can place your order & pay first, do your marketing, then come back & collect your carrot cake

Have patronized this stall for many years and the carrot cake is as tasty as ever. The prices have since gone up though and so have the crowds. Most of the time, customers will place their orders and collect later due to the sheer number of orders, so do not be fooled into thinking that there is no queue if you do not see people in front of the stall. Manned by two sisters (i think) whom do not really smile but that does not stop one from ordering the very fragrant carrot cake with the generous amount of chai poh and eggs. A wonderful breakfast for weekends, they close around noon, thus be there early if you wish to partake in the carrot cake
