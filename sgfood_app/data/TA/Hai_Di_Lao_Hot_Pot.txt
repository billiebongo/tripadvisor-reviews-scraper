Excellent service. Food is awesome too. Should at least try once. Many other branches besides this.Great place for gathering with friends and family.

Great service as usual, consistent with my previous visit.
Q service to be improved, flexibility required by Host/team sorting out the sitting Arrangement.... there is bound to be last minute changes to the no. Of pax showing up.

Fantastic wonderFULL service (except for one or two trainees). Meat ate fresh. Been to the "real thing" in prc thus find it pricey in sg. If not for the high living standard in sg in terms if "raw materials"...it will be afforadable enough for me to dine here weekly. 芝麻酱@sesamee paste too diluted compared to those in China

We made reservations. My son and daughter-in-law brought my wife and I there for lunch. From the moment we arrived, we had great and excellent service. I was surprised by the smallest details they had looked into for the customer to have a seamless eating experience. From covers for the handphones and hand bags to shawls for those who are feeling cold because of the aircon. We had never experienced such service in Asia before. I salute the management to have trained a great team. There was a trained child minder in the nursery room for parents who have restless children and even have a baby cot. This is a hot pot restaurant. We had a combination of four soup base and the tomato soup base was excellent. Besides that, the fresh meat and sea food is nothing special as I have eaten at many different hot pot and steam boat. But, I would highly recommend this place for the experience of a good meal
5
it was always a long queue in front of this restaurant(at least 1,5hours wait for walk in). please make a reservation in advance. the service was really good compare to any other hotpot restaurants in singapore. they gave you hot towel every 15 -20minutes. all u can eat for the sauce and dessert(slice fruits). free lollipop for my 3yrs kid. highly recommend restaurant. recommend dishes: la mian noodle and the premium beef. recommend soup:shezwan sou
5
I ate at this restaurant every time I visited Singapore in the last couple of years and the food and the service is consistently good. It’s a big restaurant with sometimes long queues, however the staff do an excellent job at managing the restaurant. In the queue you’re offered nick knacks and have access to some games. There is also usually a kids play area and a mani pedi service for the ladies! These were closed for refurbishment this time. Considering the size of the queue it moves very fast so waiting time isn’t too bad. Once at your table the staff are very attentive and the food is really quite good. Will be back
5
Tried 2 types of soup: mushroom and chicken stock. Plus their signature beef n pork, beef ball n fish ball. Sauces were great! Fruits were fresh too! Desserts are provided as all u can eat till you drop.. you need to make a prior reservation because the outlet is always full and we have to wait till people finished eating. Best part is that we were provided with tomato cherry, popcorn n french fries which children for sure will love it. The waitress who served us, Jenny, was very sweet and hospitable. There was a show of a dance with different mask which was very attractive. Will for sure drop by again on my future trips
5
I have visited the restaurant countless times, and each time I am impressed by their excellent standard of their service and food. My last visit was yesterday, and I want to specially mention Xu Bo for her excellent service. Seriously, this restaurant reminds me of the Singapore Airlines of decades ago, when it was the airline with the service that other airlines talked about
5
There's always a queue at Hai di lao but the wait is very bearable as they have complimentary snacks, drinks and origami and little tables while you wait. The service at this place is exceptional and five stars! The staff is extremely attentive and nothing is too big of an ask. They give you an apron, hair tie for girls, mobile phone wipes and plastic to cover the phone too. The soups are delicious and the meat is really fresh. You have to order the hand made noodles. A chef will come out with a stereo and perform the pulling of the noodles in a dance. Very very entertaining. There's unlimited condiments and desserts as well
4
Walked in during weekday lunch, no queues.Services were excellent from the friendly staff.Food is as normal like those usual steamboat.Tomato soup and Szechuan spicy soup would be the recommended.Overall, I would say too pricey as 2 of us and the bill was S$126. If I were have to queue for more than an hour and pay this price, I would rather go for something else
1
The waiting time is ridiculously long, basically steam boat and hot pot is quite plentiful in Singapore.
The only redeeming factor is the service but honestly waiting 3 hours for a table is madness!
I definitely won't come back!
4
Always feel that Hai Di Lao hotpot is quite a nice place to hang out if you have cravings for hotpot with a group of friends because you get to eat more variety at a lower cost haha! Service is always good and food standard is quite consistent I feel. However, it is still $$$. You pay for the service so cannot say anything about it haha
5
Despite my numerous times here, Hai di lao never fail to meet and even exceed my expectations. The service level is simply impeccable. All the staffs pay even the smallest detail - while waiting you get free drinks, popcorns, fruits, ice creams and even manicures for ladies. The waiting time, can be extremely long so be prepared to wait. Avoid peak periods like dinner time, fridays and weekends. Food are of extreme high quality. I really love the tomato soup and the hot spicy soup! ( though i can't take spicy that well lol )Price is on the high side, but its worth every penny. Ramen comes with a free 'dance', whereby one of the staff will perform some very interesting stunts for entertainment purposes. This is one of my favourite hotpot hideout, and will definitely come back for more
5
The restaurant staff service was excellent, during the waiting time, the restaurant will provide some snacks. When order food, the waitress will explain very clear how to order and give some recommend of some famous dish. One thing want to mention is don't forget to order "lamen", when they serve the"lamen", there is a free "lamen" show in front of you. Is worth to wait and visit.
4
My friend recommended this place. The best hot pot that I have ever had, however I found it very expensive. The taste was delicious, the service was good but not excellent, the decor was ok. In sum, it's not a fancy place but a good hot pot to share with family
5
Despite the crowd and long wait... the soup choices were great and tasty. Ingredients were fresh and it's worth to order a hand made noodle... a short 1 min demo by a young good looking noodle maker was entertaining and gave a great experience. Services by the ladies/ waitresses were 5 star. Good job
4
Went with a big group (9 of us) for weekday dinner and we had a room, which was a good thing as the main dining area was really noisy with poor sound insulation. Our waitress from China provided impeccable service which can sometimes be overwhelming, e.g. she calls everyone handsome guy or pretty lady. She also gave us a lot of freebies. A group of wait stuff came in with a birthday cake and hearty rendition of the Cantonese birthday song for one of the guys in our group. We ordered about 17 ingredients including beef, pork, golden pomfret fish and chicken, and the total bill came up to about S$400 net. Best of all, there's no corkage for BYO alcohol. Steamboat being what it is, I don't find the food really special or something I'd rave about, so the four stars is really for the service.
5
Extra friendly and attentive service, will take care of you like their most important guest. Family and infant friendly (they even provide baby cot and milk warmer). High quality meat, seafood and veggie. Chicken broth was particularly nice with black chicken and mushroom. Don't forget to order the lamien which they pull and roll in front of you as an extra entertainment
4
Sichuan hotpot comes with many frills. Like the flavorful soup and fresh choice of ingredients. Only deterrence is the wait times per table about 1.5 to 2 hrs. To help guests kill time, they offer free children playground, gel manicure service, light snacks and drinks. Thinly sliced Shabu shabu meat comes with half or full portion so you can try more with less pax. Recommend the double pot soup base for 2 different types of soup. Sichuan is a must. Family welcome with free desserts and children get toys and sweets.
5
Great food and great service!! We came at 11 PM and were told the queue would be around 45 mins. They called us when our number was near and we only waited on site for 5-10 minutes, but the wait wasn't bad at all as we were provided with free drinks and snacks, plus board games and magazines were available. There is also a free manicure service while waiting, but there is a queue for that too, and we didn't try it.When we were seated, we chose the food on the ipad. We especially liked the seasoned beef! It goes really well with the spicy sichuan soup, although I would recommend getting both the spicy soup and the chicken soup, as the spicy soup base really is spicy. We ordered 5-6 half portion dishes which was a little more than enough for two of us, and the bill came at around 60 S$.The service is great, our drinks were constantly refilled without having to ask. There is a compartment below the table with charging cables for your phones, plus they give you a ziploc bag to protect your phone. They also gave me a wipe for my glasses, which is a neat additional service. Definitely a place I want to return to!
5
First time trying HDL and it was really worth the time and money. HDL providing a very good service and the soup was too good!
Give it a try and please call to make reservation!
5
this place is famed mainly because of its ridiculously high service standards, especially from its flagship shop in China. the servers are extremely polite, friendly, attentive. food is decent as always.
4
We were here and had to wait for a hour to be seated for a group of nine . It was worth the wait as always, the service staffs were attentive and warm, the broth was lovely and the food was good.satisfying meal
5
Average waiting time about an hour, but you won't feel bored with self service snack and drinks like buffet spread. Manicure and children playroom also available to kill time. Excellent service with attention to details, food is good too. Worth the wait!
5
1st time try this joint cause word of mouth from one friend to another.I tried it with my wife and kid. We love it. Love it!The soup we ordered was chicken soup and spicy. The chicken soup base for me is the best. My wife and kid loved it too. For the spicy one was too hot to handle.The sauce all you can take and mix by yourself. Or you can ask them to mix it for you.The waitress and service are superb. Best so far. They will take care of your kid in small playground while you eat. Or if the ladies are to lazy to wait they can do manicure pedicure. Imagine that kind level of service!Definately i will be back for sure

Located at 313, pretty unique restaurant geared towards Cust sat ! Waiting is pleasant - being served with snacks & drinks while selecting from the menu. For ladies ; there's manicure thrown in as well .Pretty pack & busy . But although so, the environment remains pleasant with sufficient aircon . And Service is good despite the crowd . One can select up to 4 types of broth - Try the tomato soup, mushroom, seafood and mala. But be mindful that the mala broth is potent. Don't miss the la mien; as they will do the pull noodles at your table ! Worth a go and from the experience; I will return . . A tat pricy but it's still value for money. And do make a reservation; else it can be a Long wait.

Don't be surprise if you have to wait four to five hours before you can have your meal at this restaurant. We went to get queue ticket on the first night but it would be taken four hours for us. So we just choose another restaurant for our fist day dinner. On another day, we went there to get queue ticket for 4 persons at 6pm and was informed that our turn will be at 10pm. Then we decided to go for other restaurant and be back here at 10pm. Two dinners. Nice. You won't be bored while you are waiting. Loads of people waiting in front of the restaurant as same as you do. You can play board games, enjoy fruits and snacks, and even you could get minicure for free while waiting. That's amazing. Never seen like this in my whole life. Sechuan soup is famous there but I like the Chicken soup more. You can choose up to 4 soups in your pot. You have to pay SGD 4 in addition per person if you want sauce to dip. There are several types of sauce for you. For us 4 persons, 2 soups, 1 bottle of beer, 2 plates of slice beef, 1 plate of wonton, and 1 beef ball plate costed us SGD 150. Not bad. You should try at least once
3
Went on Sunday and was told the wait was 2.5 hours. Came back the next day for lunch and we were given a table immediately. Go advice is to go during lunch on a weekday unless you enjoy waiting and like the snacks they provide FOC for customers waiting for a table. They have 4 types of soup base. I like the tomato base as it is quite unique while my mum likes the spicy stock. Actually we go to hai di lao for the convenience as we can now buy hai di lao soup base from most supermarkets now. I have tried the tomato and it tasted very similar. You can also buy the meat, vegetables and other ingredients from the local supermarkets and recreate your own hai di lao hotpot which would probably cost you less than 50% of the price you pay to dine here.... plus no long waiting time...
5
The service is still as good as before. They observed how many persons were taking the sauce and drinking tea, then they charged accordingly. We had ten persons eating but were charged 7 persons on the bill. Very good practice without customer inform them. Furthermore the birthday surprise was really surprise! Everyone was satisfied
4
I guess we were lucky, we went there early enough to get our number, and when we returned, a table was available withing 5 minutes. Also the restaurant is worth a visit. there is free manicure available for the ladies, the personnel is super nice and having the hot pot dish requires a lot of attention, in terms of giving you fresh broth, towels,...I was less impressed with the food. We had the 4 kinds of broth (Laksa, tomato, chicken and fish), but the chicken and fish tasted the same, and were equally flavourless. All we ordered looked good and was fresh, no complaints in terms of quality, but somehow it got kinda 'boring' quickly.So it is worth to go there, but only once..
4
A great location for supper, Beers are well chilled. There's a showmanship when you order Kway Teow. Kind of pricey but worth the visit!
4
Good variety of food.. All meat and vegetables are fresh and clean. The soup are very nice and delicious. The staff serve us with a smiling face and they are very attentive and patient. They even gave me hair band and wipe for my spectacle without have to ask. One of our family member have birthday cake and the staff gather together to sing birthday song with us and present the cake very nicely. They have the initiative to add some fruits to make our small cake more presentable.. This restaurant also give free manicure service for the customer. As my cousin is waiting for her turn to do her nails, the staff offered us free ice-cream while waiting. Although those additional free stuff doesn't cost much but we feel very welcoming and well taken care by the staff. I'll definitely recommend friends and will come back again. Just hope this restaurant will continue to put their heart in giving good service to the customers.

As a fan of all things hotpot, this was one restaurant that was high on the must-try list. So much has been said about it and there were rave reviews. So I finally had the chance to visit to the outlet at 313 @ Somerset. Luckily my friend had done some research and was informed that we could book a table at 6pm, after which they would not be able to take bookings.So we arrived at 6pm and were shown to our table. This restaurant is known for their service and admittedly, service was attentive. At times, probably too attentive. All food is ordered via the tablet and one plus point is that you can order half portions rather than full portions. There is a variety of soup stocks to choose from and you can have from one stock to four different stocks, including the popular tomato flavour.Limited choices for vegetables but they had a fair selection of meats, and meatballs, and other hotpot dishes. There is the special noodle order where the chef will come out and perform a little "dance" as he pulls the noodles for you. There is condiment counter where you can choose your sauces, plus help yourself to fresh fruits and some snacks and tidbits and dessert. However, they charge SGD 4 per person for the condiment counter. We did wonder how they would charge us if only 1 person went to get sauces but the others tasted the sauces.This restaurant is also known for the extras they provide for customers who are waiting for their table including a playroom for young children, free manicure/pedicure, free herbal teas and light snacks as well as free Wifi. All this for free while you wait as it is not unusual to wait 2 to 3 hours for a table!Our overall dining experience was that the food was good but probably not enough to make us come back, especially if we have to wait an hour for a table. The soups were decent, quality of ingredients was good but not exceptional and overall it was pricey. And you still have to pay for sauces. Did they expect customers to eat without sauces? And while the service is good, that alone is not enough to get us back.Nevertheless, the restaurant has its fans so I guess it will continue to thrive but personally, I think there are other options to consider.
3
The food was good, considering the theatrics and long wait, even at 9pm. Not sure why the waitress kept coming to the table and playing with the iPad on the trolley - most distracting when you're eating. If you need spices and condiments to make a meal more palatable they should be free, not an extra $4 per person. As for the strange tray of snacks before the meal, including popcorn, and waiting customers being given a free manicure in the same foyer.... this is probably one of the most bizarre restaurants I've ever eaten at
4
Yes, there's many places where one can get good hot pot but not many can give the same feel-good experience like Hai Di Lao.What really stands out from the rest is the service. From the time you call in or get your queue number until the time you pay. You are made to genuinely feel they are extremely grateful for your patronage. Every time, all the time. You are served unlimited drinks, snacks, fruits and to my kid's delights, ice cream and popcorn while you wait. Occasionally porridge too. Mind you, it's a NOT a buffet eatery, apart from the condiments and a few desserts at $4/head.My group of diners, whether family or friends are not big on meat or seafood. This place caters to all. There are 2 non-meat soup stock - the superb tomato and the mushroom. Just ask the friendly waiters. They will be able to suggest vegetarian-friendly stock. Even the mah lak (spicy soup) can be made using no-meat base.The wait is shortest before 5pm and between 10pm-12am. The Orchard and Clark Quay branches get busier after 12am. Or get a number and go shop or catch a movie first
5
I went for the steamboat or hot pot for a few occasions. First the servers treat u like king n queen. Their service is super. The choices of food and soup base is good. The sauces has very varieties too. Good place for family bonding n dinner. U have to queue for hours on busy day or dinning hours.
5
I just never experience any others Hot Pot restaurant provide such WONDERFUL SERVICES. Really !We were serve for free drinks and snacks while we are waiting to be seat (Long queue), and the most impressive part is FREE Nail Polish Service for the lady guest while having meals at the Shop, what a VALUE Added to the restaurant
4
The first time I visit this Hai di Lao was in China NangJing, while waiting for your seat they serve you with drinks or if you are lady you can have a manicure free of charge.Before you start your foods, they provide an 围巾，and a plastic bag to keep your handphone. You can order what you want , the price might a bit higher compare to some restaurants but foods is ok.For 313 Somerset , you need to wait a longer time cos a bit crowded during dinner time, but the seat is quite spacious.Overall, I find still worth to try, especially if you like to try spicy soup with 麻辣
4
Three things stood up for me at Hai Di Lao:The good:- 'make your own' dipping sauces from a buffet spread of condimentsThe ma-la chilli mix was the hero, however there were enough other herbs, spices and garnishes to concoct less spicy sauces- fresh ingredients especially the seafood and the meatsThe skewered prawns were quite large; the prawn paste was very fresh; we also ordered the kurobuta pork and the US beef both freshly sliced from the kitchenWe've been there several times - the average bill was $50 -75 per head for a hearty dinner.The staff were attentive - our waitress was at our table every few minutes and responded to our requests promptly.- shawls were offered when we commented that it was chilly- additional orders were taken promptly - stock mix too-ups for the soups were also done upon requestAdded bonus when we were there last night was the 'face-changing' performance and the noodle pulling display at our tableThe huge downer was of course the long waiting time at 6 pm to 8pm. We were told it was 3 hours when we arrived at 6.30pm but were shown to our table about an hour later
3
Having heard about the queue and the craze over this restaurant , I was already skeptical about it as there are many hot pot restaurant out there.Made an effort to dine with some colleagues and left feeling the place is overrated.It was very crowded when we arrived and I was immediately put off by the loud music playing at the restaurant.What stood out is of course the service and he extent they go out to please customers, very service oriented and if you want to be pampered go for it but then I felt the service does not come from the heart but rather systematic because they know they have to please.The range of food is good and fresh for the meat which we ordered and the tomato soup base wins my vote. The condiments to go with the food is also excellent.Beyond that every thing else is just average not to the range of very good.If you ask me if I will go back, I would say no at the price level.
5
This is the first in 2017. Qualities of services and foods are still good.
Lunch has less crowd so we didn't need to wait for long.
Overall experience was still excellent!
5
Book early!They are the most considerate restaurant I have ever been. Very popular restaurant with long wait, yet it's pleasant....The toddlers are entertained with mini playground The ladies were offered with free manicure The mens can clean their glasses.While waiting, we enjoy the herbal drink and snacks. They have many choices of soup base. We had chicken soup, tomato base, mushroom & ma la. The ingredients are fresh with many variety. We enjoy our bite from appetizers to deserts. During the dinner, we were entertained with "bian lian" or changing face, dancing noodle,...The most impressive part for me, they provide baby bed for sleeping. The restaurant was very busy but the service was excellent. No grumpiness detected.
5
Been back again and again. Service is immaculate, and the food is always fresh. I've paid an average of $50 per person. Not cheap but I've always walked away very satisfied. The queue is still crazy even with new branches opening up. Be prepared to wait at least 1.5hours during dinner time.

Similar to what I have seen in China, Hai Di Lao has brought the same level of service to Singapore. To me, this place is selling service and experience, hot pot is only a commodity.Starting from taking reservation call, waiting area, free manicure, kid playing area leading us to table, patience explanation of how to order, suggesting us to order half share (since only 2 of us), attentive to small details such as plastics cover for handphone, etc, hardly anything to fault. (well, they have forgotten to serve my chinese tea, but didn't dampen my spirit)Of cos, all these come with a price, if you are looking for affordable buffet hot pot, this is definitely not your choice.However, for me, as I am celebrating my wife birthday during lunch time, all these services and great experience did add more colours to our meal.Although the price is not cheap, however, you will know what price are you going to pay when you bill (excluding the taxes), the ordering pad indicated clearly how much have you ordered.Overall to me, definitely not an everyday hot pot location, but I felt that the overall experience is great, won't mind to be back again
3
The food are fresh. The service is great. The environment...quite a different environment for chit chatting. Went there late at night, so only queue for 15mins.To me, it's just so so. Hotpot is depends on the soup, but I feel nothing special about it (feel quite oily) and not worth it. Maybe it's because the highly rated, I expected to be different. Can't deny that the food are fresh, but the price is too high as the quantity is low and you have to order more for a meal.Would recommend if going for a little supper or gathering
3
While its food are definitely fresh (but expensive) and impeccable service(plus free acrobatic performance on serving food), somehow the soup stock is too salty that we need to add in our own water to dilute it After our attempts to do that, it is still at "11", if the extreme end of the rating for saltiness is 10Would I come back? Likely a no
5
Can be expensive if you order all the fresh seafood. Watch what you order and it's okay - quite reasonable.Most of the time, we will have to wait more than 1h. Go during off peak weird hours and sometimes we don't have to wait at all. Service is impeccable.My Favourite soup base is the tomato and I will get the extra strong （特浓）
4
To be honest... It is a decent hot pot whereby the soup base is good and the ingredients which you order are fine. However i think that the waiting time is far too long... Got the queue number at 5pm and was told to wait till 8pm...Personally i feel that it may be a little overrated due to the waiting time but since females like it alot. I guess i dont really have much of a choic
5
In this place. There is a delicates staff to service u. They will give u hot towel n hand phone cover Plastic. N screen wiper more. Really make u feel like king in queen n prince n princess. The food is also fantastic. The variety is a lot too. IT Is the best steamboat restaurant I ever been to.
4
There's a reason this restaurant is mostly long queue during lunch and dinner hours. First, i like the variety of soup bases... pickled veg and tomato are my 2 favourites Handmade noodle is a must order. Service is great since one waiter is assigned to 6 tables. Sauces are great; $4 per bowl. A little inconvenience is the fact that my parent wasn't allowed to enter before I arrived. They were already hungry however snacks were provided for free. saw a free manicure but didn't know how to take advantage of it
5
A must-try soup is tomato soup, also the sauces are very special. The price is quite high but it is worth. For 2 person can choose small soup to save money
5
Best hotpot, best service.
Very very fresh meats and seafood. Great variety.
Definitely a must if in town!
4
Visited here with some family and it was great. Very accommodating for our daughter too. Reasonably priced. Will be back again soon.
5
I dont have to wait. There isnt any Q. What a surprised. We go there to see whether we have the luck to eat there.....hmmm...Indeed ! We are lucky.We have selected the tomato base soup....it is good. The meatball that my gf selected was really awesome. Overall, the food and the service are awesome !!
5
Seriously this was the first time I have waited for a tableGiving up is definitely an option but I would like to taste and experience why people queue up so long for a meal here.It turn up very good. First thing first, their service comes everytime with a smile, patient explaining the menu, recommending dishes. That for me has cover part of my waiting time.The other part was the food, steamboat is all about the soup base. You could have up to 4 choice of soup base in a table, that is 50% of the soup base choices available. I picked both what traditional chinese would eat, herbal chicken soup and the szechuan spicy soup.That Szechuan soup is one of the best szechuan spicy soup I've tasted, aroma number one, next spicy and the numbness comes in within seconds.What goes in the soup, choose from noodles, greens, meat - beef, pork, chicken, assortment of balls.What goes well with them besides the soup is their wide array of condiments. Mix and match however you like according to your preference, sweet, sour or spicy. Anything you mix could be a secret recipe of your own! However if you do not know what to mix, simply ask an employee there to mix one of their signature condiments. They did one of their and it wow-ed me and goes very well with beef dishes.If you want some entertainment, order the ramen (noodle), it comes with performance.For all of these, it truly does burn a hole in my pocket, but it worth the wait and the money
3
I honestly do not know what the craze is about. The experience & service I must say is good but the food & soup base is just average for the price. Saw many people queuing up & 1 got really angry he got to wait too Long for his liking
4
We came here for our cousins' outing and had booked a VIP room. It was supposed to be shorter waiting time but still was quite a long wait. The VIP room was spacious and each of us had to order a personal pot of $8 per person and each of us could have our individual choice of soup, so no need to be limited to the bigger central pot for sharing. Needless to say, we had dedicated service and the server would assist you to mix your sauces. What we like about the food was the freshness and the handmade fish balls, not the frozen ones we get at other hot pot restaurants. You can even order half a portion instead of the full portion if there were fewer people. Service was of course top notch and unhurried. Good place to have a catch up, will consider the VIP room again for our next visit 
5
This is a very popular restaurant for a hot pot experience in Singapore. After eating here, you will know why. You create your own dipping sauces with fresh coriander, garlic, different chilis, soya, sesame oil and seeds... many different meats are boiled in the peppery broth to perfection. A bit of entertainment when the noodle guy spins a giant doodle around his head. During your waiting for a table (even with reservation) you can have free tea, popcorn, watermelon.. even free manicure! I kept my appetite for the main course
5
Hai Di Lao is a well known name among friends who love steamboat and it's often the go to place to celebrate special occasions! The Somerset outlet is my fave as it is conveniently located at Somerset 313 and there are more spaces between tables compared to the Clarke Quay outlet. It is also a common fact that you often have to wait for 1-2 hours despite making reservations, so this outlet is ideal where you and your friends can take turns to walk around while waiting.In the meantime, you do not need to bear the hunger pangs as there is free unlimited access to the popcorns, banana chips, fruits, ice cream and drinks at the waiting area. On top of that, manicure service is available for the ladies while children can be entertained in the play area.As you get seated, the servers will continue to offer you the following - rubber bands for those with long hair, cloth to clean your specs, mini ziplock bags for handphones to prevent contact of spillage, warm towels to freshen up, cloth to cover your bags and aprons to protect stains on your tops, etc. Service is truly impeccable! Finally when it comes to the food, the soup base choices are worth mentioning! We particularly like the tomato based, salted vegetable and mala flavors! However, if you are a meat lover, the beef slices would go better with the chicken broth so that you can savor the sweetness of the beef. The other soup flavors would overpower the beef's natural taste. We also enjoy our usual orders of the pork collar, cod fish and the la mian that is always paired with a dramatic performance by the noodle server. Food quality is definitely fresh and you will crave for more after each visit! Even my husband who is not a fan of steamboat has been won over since his first visit! Hai Di Lao is worth the visit with its superb service and high food quality! It's a must try if you haven't step in!
5
The place is awesome, must visit again when I return to Singapore. We get to choose the broth, then the ingredient theme. There is the open desert bar with pastries and ice cream. The noodle is worth the trip, as they stretch and swing the noodles before you, then plops into the pot. All the veggie and meats are wonderfully fresh. The great service is when we were waiting in the outside waiting area, they gave us a tray of fruit to munch on, I should have save room for the inside food :
5
Wonderful service, yummy food. My favourite hotpot in Singapore. A must try. Do take note that queueing time for dinner time might take up to 2-4 hours! Totally worth the wait!
5
My family had a pleasant surprise when they served a plate of beautiful fruit tray with birthday cake to celebrate my cousin's 21st!!! It was awesome!!
4
The place is nicely decorated, service was very attentive started when we entered the place they welcome us with a nice greeting and smile. Food was considered good although I have tasted better one somewhere else. What impressed me the most was the Noodle show since it is very entertaining. :

Went there with my families. Heard Hai Di Lao is very famous of the foods and the services.It turned out to be true.Though the mala soup is a lil bit spicy & oily, i still can eat it. The selection of chillies are amazing.They provide good quality foods, thus i definately will come back again for more

Be sure to make a reservation or you risk a couple of hours wait, even though they provide services like manicure/pedicure and even gaming equipment, to have to wait so long is very mood-dampening.Must try their handmade noodles to see them in action and their foods are really fresh. However it is quite pricey, therefore some might find it more worth to head to a buffet hotpot restaurant. Still worth a try, if you are in China Beijing etc, try theirs there! It came from there

First time visit and amazed by the very long queue of people outside the restaurant. I am lucky that my Singaporean friend has anticipated the situation and was be able to reserve a room for us during our visit to Singapore. I heard without reservation, it could be up to 3-4 hours queue. My goodness!! amazingly, people are willing to wait for it. May be because of the good service they provide, like manicure, free appetizer and drinks, kids play room. and definitely must taste wow. deciding the menu we want to order is a bit confusing. So many soup base. we can order up to 4 soup base cooking in the same pot. Recommended by friend and because of majority of my family doesn't like spicy, then we chose their best soup which is tomato soup and chicken soup. My friend help me to order mix of the meat, seafood and vegetable. She also order the signature noodle which is the highlight for this dinner. Not just regular noodle. A skilled server come to our room and perform noodle making from dough with interesting twisting, stretching to the longest distance and swirling action. Fun to watch. They also provide free flow of sauces, ice cream, fruits, hot desert and cold desert. It comes with the package. Great price. We spend about $270 for 10 people, feeling so full and still leave some food uneaten. Very recommended restaurant

First time visited after lots of recommendation from friends. Visited on a weekend at 3 PM which suppose to be non peak hour for any meal except serving hi tea. We reach the outlet about 3 pm that required us to wait around 1 hr plus, which put us on the waiting list. Restaurant is pack and full. We were shock that restaurant still can be filled at this hour. While waiting you can enjoy some light refreshment before entering to enjoy you actual meal. Food like cut fruits, some tidbits, herbal tea and etc. while waiting for your turn you can enjoy some complimentary Medicure or pedicure. A kids room available for the kids to enjoy themselves too. Wait till our turn about 1 hr plus, we were direct to our table, while servers serve some hot towel to each of us. Deciding or the dishes. We select 4 soup some meat and seafood combination.Service was fast. First the servers scoop a bowl of soup before cooking the raw ingredient. Server will assist you to cook the ingredient, to ensure the food is not under / over cook. They will as well constantly provide hot towel and to exchange our dirty plates. Must ordered the live hand pulled noodle. Over all food and service was perfect. But it comes with a great price as well. 4 person dine which cost us close to $200

Made a lunch reservation here for a friend's birthday, and we all had an excellent time! Because of our reservation and since it was lunchtime there was no wait at all, but be prepared for a long wait if you come for dinner! Friends have waited 3+ hours for a table. Delicious food with a great sauce bar that had free flow fruit as well (a small top-up price per person, worth it!!!) - definitely nice to end the meal with! They also presented my friend with a nice fruit tray for her birthday, a great touch. As we were leaving we noticed the ice cream cooler at the front, wish I had known about it sooner so I could have saved room for a complimentary cone :)Loved at the end of the meal the signature noodles that they prepared for us. It was like a mini-show, watching the server prepare and stretch the dough by swirling it around himself (and us!) before dropping it in our soup. Make sure to order at least one serving, and get your cameras ready

This is my first visit to Hai Di Lao. I heard a lot of positive feedbacks and the long waiting time. However I was brought to a table after waited for less than 5 min. It was 4++pm Saturday.The service was excellent and the staffs were very polite, friendly and attentive.Food was great and fresh. I will highly recommend tomato soup based and their hand made noodle. Will come back again

I have been telling friends that I only eat hotpot when I am in Bangkok. But a late supper at Hai Di Lou changed that. Friends had actually wanted to eat there on a Friday but when they arrived at 7pm, there was a 4 hour wait as they do not take reservations. So we met elsewhere for drinks and returned at 11pm and was promptly shown to the table.This China-style hotpot is very popular even at this late hour. We had a pot divided into 4 compartments for the variety of soup stock that was available. From mushroom to chicken to seafood and of course the Mala stock.There is a buffet of sauces and porridge. We had some meat balls, chicken and fish along with minced prawn which was awesome. The meats were fresh. We also had cockles and the best part was that the waitress asked if we wanted them shelled and she actually did the work for us. That's great service.The Shaven Noodles came with a show too. Will definitely return to this 24-hour joint but at off-peak periods for either very early dinner or late night meal

Premium hot pot restaurant in Singapore! The food is very fresh and of high standard. They have a great variety of ingredients to choose from and we had a difficult time choosing.
However, I feel that it is overpriced!
5
Went for midnight supper very good service no q fresh food love the sauce selection the service were good I ordered the handmade noodle and they prepared it at the table will surely be back keep up the good job!

Good experience at the restaurant. Food was good and wait staff service is excellent. Heard about the long queue and thus we made reservation before hand. Quite a good variety of food. Tried chicken and mala soup types. Both good.

overall Good food, good service and friendly staff BUT the queue was long (at least 1.5 to 2 hours wait.)

First visit to this place with my father and when we arrived, we are greeted by friendly staff and have us seated at the front desk area(some popcorns, tibits and watermeLon was served) while they get our tables ready(Waiting time was around 10mins only probably due to early morning 11am and the crowd just started.Great service from their staff(晓恒) from little details like how to order, asking us whether do we want to add some condiments to the soup, providing us scoop (or watever u call it) stand for holding the scoop whiLe cooking the meat, topping our tea beverage and soup and etc.Warm towels are provided by the friendly staff and probably halfway or towards the end of your meal, they offered to change new warm towels for us.If you are worried about wasting the food that you ordered(just in case you cant finish), you can also order in half portion instead of full portion(applys to most of the food). I just ordered pork, beef, cod fish, wintermelon, spinach(all in half portion) and home made noodles(except this no half portion but its just nice for 1 person) the chicken flavour soup base that i choosen(as you can see from the photo) itself has already have china and oyster mushroom, fishball and black chicken meatAfter we have finished our lunch, we are pvided tooth picks and sweets to end our meal(most of the places you have to ask for tooth pick). Their service was very good and without prompting.As for the price, i personally feel is reasonable and worth to pay for regardless its the food quality or the service provided by the staff

Great service , good business, we waited for 1 hour, but the staffs gave us free drinks, snack, even handphone charges service while we waiting for table to be arrange. Ordered food, full service for us, like prawn to be un shelled, staff playing lamian infront of you, birthday song for those who birthday ! Food is still ok, price reasonable

I saw how people lined up for hours to eat here, and I wanted to give it a try. This restaurant offers a : manicure, lens cleaner for your glasses, popcorn-fruit-cracker while you are waiting for your seats... They even have a children's room! Intrigued....Well the Ipad menu is in Chinese - and I dont read/speak Chinese, so it was hard for me to order...The Mushroom & Laksa soup were yummy, ... The sauces and condiments were plentiful... The service staff was so nice, but language barrier still made it hard for me to enjoy my lunch...It was an experience ...

This is undoubtedly my top Favourite hotpot restaurant internationally. Since its entrance into Singapore from China, all the outlets always have a snaking Long queue and you will need to queue for an average of 2 hrs to get a table. Reservations highly encouraged 3-4 weeks in advance unless you have time to sit around and wait. There's free flow popcorn, fruits and melon tea at the waiting area. Ma la (Zhong la) spicy base is always my core choice for the hotpot soup. Their tomato, as well as 4 Flavours soup bases are really good too. Fragrant, rich and delicious to drink! Their mashed scallops and black pork are must-orders each time I visit. I also like their homemade cuttlefish cakes. Other items I order frequently are luncheon meat, Chinese cabbage, quail eggs, crown daisy, sliced fish, pig's brain, crispy fish skin and occasionally black fungus. Condiments and drinks are chargeable at $4 and $3 per pax respectively. The bill normally comes up to between $85-$100 for 2 pax which isn't cheap at all but I will always come back for more!Would definitely love to try this in China sometime. Heard its significantly cheaper over there as well

The food quality here is good, also providing a very good service to customers here. But it's a long queue to get in there so if you would like to have a try, please be early. They do provide titbits and manicure services for free - whilst waiting. They have a kiddy playground for the families with kids so they won't get bored. As for the food, the steamboat soup base was great, much better than I have tried (other restaurants) and you must definitely try on their noodles which they will make in front of you. Its a must try! Overall, despite the long queues, I would definitely go back for the food and services!

I chose the wrong day to come and try this restaurant. They don't accept bookings on weekends and the wait can be at least 2 hours. Mine was around 3 hours and boy oh boy, it was a pain to wait for so long. I was wondering, what's the fuss about this place? The only upside for waiting so long is that they provide unlimited snacks and drinks for you while you wait. Some even opt to go shopping first after taking the number. Anyway, once we got in, I get the hype about it. Their service is top notch, with them providing hair ties for ladies to tie up your hair, clear plastic packets to keep your phone from getting drenched in hot pot soup, lens wipes for those who wear glasses, even providing aprons if you need them. They also provide free manicure service, though the wait is even longer. For the food and the hot pot soup, the szechuan mala soup was awesome. Meats were all very fresh and the noodle was excellent. All in all, I would come back again, as long as I can book a table on weekdays

Yes the que was long but they let you take number and calls you when the table is ready. Good food, good service and friendly staff. I wish they could communicate more in English!

7 of us ate here, what a experience. Great food affordable. Get here early, make a booking if you can. The Wait is long. However they feed you with treats if you wait. There is even ice creme..

I super love hai di Lao, they have the best soup base ever! Especially the tomato soup base. And I love their service too! Free manicure services for ladies, children's play room and snacks serving while you waiting for the table.

My friends made a reservation for 2.30pm. When we arrived, there was not queue, on a Sunday. Maybe we picked an odd time to eat lunch. Friend brought her nephew along and he had fallen asleep when they arrived. The staff at the restaurant was so nice, and let him sleep in the crib. And they also gave us cloth to cover our bags, just in case the food cooking smell would stayed on it.Food was fresh and delicious. I would definitely go back for more. More importantly, the waiting staffs was so friendly and nice

Finally got to try it 1 day and we were lucky cause there was no queue at all. Very nice and top notch service. Food quality wise is good, i personally recommend the prawn ball. their specialty pulled noodle, dumpling and of course their sliced beef which was very fresh! Overall happy with the experience and definitely make up for the higher price they charge
5
I was there in june 2015, reached somerset 313 hai di lao at 6.30pm. It was so crowded and packed. I was given a queue number, and i waited till 9.30pm only i get a table. While waiting, they served fruits, snacks and drinks. Of course a play room for children and manicure service for ladies. You would not be bored for sure. Food wise very good, tasty steamboat. It was an enjoyable night despite the queue
5
its a classic hot pot restaurant but selection and quality of food is excellent. staff very helpfull and alway ready next to you. pay attention to spicy sauce as it mean it...ask for the show of the kung fu noodles, a guy will entertin you making the dance with noodles!
5
possibly the best hot pot i have had yet, great customer service with tons of refreshments while at the waiting area.we visited the clark quay location and had reservation the day before, during busy hours the wait could be as long as an hour or more. making reservation in advance is advised
5
Queue for 1-2 hrs. Is normal for people who want to eat steamboat here. Everytime i go, I'll just order mala soup half with black chicken soup. A must to order prawn because they'll peel for you and it's fresh! The hand made noodle here was so nice can get along with mala soup. All the food here fresh and very good service!

Went down to Hai Di Lao Hot Pot orchard branch for a lunch gathering with friends. Staff was friendly and attentive as they greeted us at the door and promptly ushered us to our seats even though we are 10 minutes earlier than our pre-booked time. Wanted to try their different soup base thus we went for the four soup base option. Herbal Chicken, Tomato, Seafood and Ma La. We love both the Herbal Chicken and Seafood soup base. Even though we are not a big fan of Ma La, we tried and can tell that their Ma La is powered pack as well. Only the Seafood flavour soup pale in comparison to the other 3. All in all, their services and food selection were all good and fresh. Pricing wise it is definitely on the higher end scale but it comes with good and attentive services as well. However for the same buck, you can get better services from the branch at Clarke Quay compared to the one at Orchard.
