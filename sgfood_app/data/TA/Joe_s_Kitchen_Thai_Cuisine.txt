It's a good Thai restaurant in western part of the island. Not very expensive yet authentic Thai taste. Mango salad, chicken Pandan, green curry are really good. They can even customise cuisine if you want only vegetarian options. Highly recommended.

Whilst it looks pretty unassuming from the outside, this is some of the best Thai cooking in Singapore. The salads and 'snacks' are particularly good - you feel like you're almost in Bangkok here.

Family dinner with kids. Was feeling hopeful becos its thai food. Not quite to our expectations. We order too much and cost $86 for 2Adults & 1kid. For a restaurant in the neighbourhood is consider expensive. The fried fish is cover with batter, kai lan is quite tastless. Banana leaf chicken not fragrance too. The fried fish cake is nice according to my son (non spicy). I will not be going back there

I havnt really tried other currys apart from being in Thailand. This green curry I had at Joe's was amazing not too spicy just perfect.My other half had a whole fish with chilli sauce. My Mrs is from Thailand she said the chilli sauce was one of the best she has had.I highly recommend this restaurant as the staff are very friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Thank you for the great food will see you again

Dont under estimate this casual eatery. It is awesome! We took some friends and some wine and enjoyed one of the best meals we have had in Singapore. The food is fresh, delicious, plentiful and prepared with love. The fantastic food is complimented by the front of house which is run by Joe's wife, Jamie. She was knowledgeable about the food and made ordering easy with her expert suggestions. Attention to detail and Jamie's warm approach really made the evening. It may not look like a fancy restaurant but we had better service and better food than many of the places in town that pretend to know about dining out

Joe's Kitchen is our regular go-to for a Thai meal. Joe is Thai and is married to a lovely Singaporean lady and they run their little restaurant from the foot of a block of HDB flats in Queensway (just opposite the Shopping Centre). The food is very authentic and is consistently of a high quality. In particular, the paad thai, tom yam soup and basil leaf pork are among our favourites. Stay for the mango sticky rice also, you won't be disappointed

This restaurant is situated at an old residential area of Singapore. Most tourists would not go there so it is mainly patronized by the locals. The food is quite good and better than some other Thai restaurants I have visited so far. I like their stuffed chicken wings and Thai Style Fried Kang Kong; the latter is really very well done and you may not get this quality if the chef is changed. Their rice crackers are strongly recommended by some but I think the dish is only so so. One negative point is that the ambience is not great as it is just too crammed with tables and chairs

Brought an overseas friend to try out thai cuisine. Loved the Tom yum clear soup which is not too spicy but very strong spices taste... this is a MUST order item. Other recommended items are the seafood tofu, honey chicken, mango sticky rice and lemongrass drink. The seafood tofu is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with crunchy water chestnut in every bite. For dessert, I'll choose mango sticky rice which comes with a generous slice of sweet thai mango and a slab of savory glutinous rice. Pour the coconut milk on top and make sure that every mouth you take is a mixture of mango + rice coated with coconut milk. For drinks, you should really try their lemongrass which is purely lemongrass boiled in water. The taste might be a little too strong for some but lemongrass is a natural herb with healing effects and it's very good for our body. Those who do not like lemongrass should get their thai milk tea as it's smooth yet not too sweet.

The Stuffed Chicken Wings, Thai Red Curry & Tom-yum soup here are to die for! The decor inside is minimalist but the vibe is homely. The food feels hearty & doesn't feel overly processed (like those franchise Thai restos) ...The portions are very good (can choose between small, medium & large - depending on your group size). This is a great place for a quick fuss free meal if you're craving Northern Thai Cuisine

Unpretentious family-run restaurant that serves comfort food with hits and misses in terms of taste and value.Recommended dishes:- Tom Yam (orange) with sliced fish >> spicy broth with fresh fish- Thai fish cake >> worth the price as accompanying salad was very refreshing- Pineapple rice >> tasty with fresh prawns- Crispy seafood tofu >> goes well with thai chilli- Thai milk tea >> sweet but not cloyingWon't recommend:- Pad Thai >> prawns gone bad- Green Curry >> no sweetness and not smooth- Stuffed chicken >> not worth the pric

We love the food. It's delicious and reasonably priced. But the service is appalling. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, it took forever to arrive. Then we saw them serving our Tom Yum soup by mistake to the table behind us who arrived much later then us. The guests from that table scooped out the soup, then upon realising its not their order, they poured it back. And then guess what. The waitress took THAT bowl of soup and gave it too us

I visited Joe's kitchen couple of times in December 2015. The place is opposite Alexandra hospital bus stop. Its a small place with indoor & outdoor seating with about 10-15 tables. The decor is quite simple. The food menu is quite extensive and offers different options in terms of proportions like small, medium & large. I tried pineapple rice, black olive rice, veg Thai green curry on my two visits. All the dishes were good. One of my favorite dessert in Thai restaurants is the Tapioca. This place also serves it and if you like sweets I would recommend to try it. Service is decent. In my opinion for the quantity and quality of food, the prices are quite reasonable. I would definitely visit the place again in future.

Food is good and service is friendly and efficient. We tried the crab fried rice, dry curry pork and mango sticky rice. Portions are generous. We took small fried rice & pork to share between two of us and had to parcel half of the pork. Fried rice was very good. Real crab is used & not crabstick. Pork curry was ok, nothing great. Mango sticky rice was really good, specially the mango, by Singapore standards. Just wish they add sesame seeds to it

Had Tom Yam with sliced fish. Chicken Laap, Prawn Cakes, and Green Mango Salad. The Tom Yum and the Mango Salad were pretty tasty and definitely spicy enough - we requested Thai style spicy.The Laap was a disappointment. The chicken was kind of chewy and lacked flavor. Service was actually attentive and good, for as restaurant in this category.The value was ok.I would not go out of my way to return. There's are other excellent Thai places in the area that I'd rather go back to

Got here through recommendation. The deco was homely. The food was fresh and well cooked. However we feel that it is a bit too pricey for the food offered.We had a good dinner except for that one fly which was hovering around us. Service is acceptable. The seating can be a little more spacious as the couple sitting next to us need to get up to let us out
4
We were a group of ten people with advance reservation and also confirmed order of menu items. As such, the service was fast and furious. The quality of the food is good and tasty. There is enough in quantity. The downside is finding parking lots for our cars as this area is very popular during lunch hour during the working week. The decoration and ambience of the restaurant is quite ordinary. Highly recommended. Will come again

I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant during my last trip in Singapore. Really missed a good plate of pad thai! I could find none in my city. This restaurant came up as one of the top recommendation. So I thought I just gave it a try. Had my hotel booked the table for us because people said the restaurant was popular especially for dinner. The restaurant was located in Alexandra (just a short walk from IKEA Alexandra). The restaurant itself was not fancy, and its service well..not fancy. But we definitely not looking for that..we were looking for good Thai food. We ordered quite a lot, tom yum soup, steamed fish, chicken wing, kangkong blacan, pad thai, etc. They were all just okay and a little bit shy in spices. But none of them were special. Even my young children found they were "just okay". As for my pad thai? Found a better one than this restaurant in a food court somewhere in Orchard

living here for 6 months and finally after passing Joe's many times I got to go twice in a week! Now I know what my friends have raved about!Fresh flavours, I love the mango salad and red and green curries.There is nothing posh or pretentious about Joe's you may get to sit outside on plastic stools or inside for the aircon. It's always busy with locals and expats.Great just great!

Went for dinner with the family and ordered quite a lot of food. We had Olive Fried Rice, Tom Yum Soup, Fried Grouper with Special Chilli Sauce, Dry Curry Chicken, Stuffed Chicken Wings, Mango Salad, Egg Omelette with Prawns and Belacan Sweet Potato Leaves. All the dishes were amazing with the exception of Dry Curry Chicken. Everything else was simply delicious with the right amount of kick to it. Service was good and prices very reasonable. I would recommend making a reservation if you want to sit inside. They also get really busy

The idea of dining at Joe's Kitchen had been in my mind for a long time ever since I spotted them while driving along the stretch of road into the AYE (Ayer Rajah Expressway). This thought had recently grew stronger when I saw our local Television Programme advertising its cuisine.One of the recommended dishes, Thai Fish Cake. Most of their "finger food" items were charged based on per piece which was quite different from other thai restaurants. Fish cake was abit oily, however the fish meat was rather fresh and one can feel the bounciness as we sank our teeth in. The salad and sweet sour chilli had complimented the dish well. Luminous yellow pineapple rice with rasins, cashew nuts, pork floss and prawns sum up the plate of pineapple rice. Taste wise, I felt that it's pretty average, nothing to rave about.The stuff chicken wing was the main highlight among all dishes. Do not worry about eating them with your bare hands and removing the bones. In fact, only the bottom part of the chicken has bone, the rest was stuffed with goodies.Let's check out their secret recipe in their stuffed chicken wings.The exterior of the wing was fried to crisp golden brown perfection with fillings made up of minced chicken meat mixed together with bits of chestnuts and sweet corn kernels. Uniquely Joe's Kitchen!After the stuff chicken, this is another specialty of Joe's Kitchen that one cannot left the place without. Given a choice of crispy tofu, hotplate and claypot toufu, the server highly recommended the first option. Well, we bought her words and it was great. Just like the stuffed chicken wings, the toufu was specially made, blended with seafood bits and fried over the hot oil. The exterior was very crispy, not too oily and to my liking.How can a Thai Cuisine be without their so called Fresh Thai Coconut and Lemon Grass drink? Ha! These were the beverages for the night.Minced Pork Omelette was nothing special, quite a standard dish.Prawns with cashew nuts was tad spicy as it was cooked with dried chilli and capsicums. Although the portion was medium, the number of prawns given wasn't that much.After the night's dinner, I find that what most interest me was their appetizer or finger food items. They were special and not many Thai Cuisine offers such items on their menu. For complete review visit, http://www.umakemehungry.com/2013/11/joes-kitchen-thai-cuisine.htm
