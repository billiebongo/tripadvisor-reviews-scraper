This restaurant is located at top floor of Mustafa center.
I ordered paper dosa.
It looks so big and taste nice!
the affordable price is also good.
4
A gem at the roof top of Mustafa Centre. We had chicken, samosa, lamb biryani and chicken biryani. The servings are generous. Enough for 2-3 person.
A pleasant experience.

The place offers a good variety of Indian and Pakistani food. My favorite is Brain Masala with Romali Roti. Their Lahori Chicken Karahi is disappointing.

Quite frequently we visit this restaurant, only for one reason - that is a good yummy food.Else there is no other reason as restaurant is an average restaurant.As typical of mustafa culture, to find this restaurant is a maze... on top of it lifts are inadequate and slow, escalators I never tried...Yes itâ€™s on the rooftop.Once you come out of the lifts, you come in to semi-covered seating area and on your left semi spherical dome having fully covered air-conditioned seating.Overall feel is good. But a lot of margin is for improvement if properly planned and maintained.Concept of semi- spherical dome is unique and looks impressive, but seems not appropriate for this purpose or not thoughtfully planned and executed. Biggest drawback is acoustics which really shall be sorted out immediately...Especially it gets worse when a event party happens in the same space...Whole dome restaurant and semi covered spaces could have been more interesting and useful if properly planned.... As space is interesting especially being on rooftop. Anyways, talking about food- yes no doubt it's good and yummy... We often visit this, and every time we love it... Lot of variety- Indian, Pakistani, indo Chinese, etc...At times also serve buffet...Love this place for the food but feel pity for it being under utilised and poorly planned and maintained..

This place is on the 7th floor of Mustafa Centre, and is not accessible by all lifts - so check before going up. The have standard Indian fare which was prepared pretty well. Service is quick and food comes in a decent time. However, their AC wasn't working well when we went so it was sweltering hot (and this was an overcast day, mind you)
4
Visited this restaurant first time. Good food. Great place inside.Though deducting one star for the approach which is from gate no 6 and thru the mustafa mall. Shabby entry so gives a wierd feel until you reach inside.Great food and slightly premium priced for Little India standards but the place demands it.Don't forget to buy a pan (digestive) at the end. Be ready to pay $140-150 for 6 people
4
We stopped here for a quick lunch while shopping at Mustafa.We ordered the paper Dosa ($5.50) and another vegetarian dish we cannot remember the name of unfortunately.Both were very tasty and large servings, more than enough for lunch. They were also very reasonably priced.The place is very nice and comfortable.The only negatives for us was the price of drinks, very expensive and the staff were a little unpleasant.Definitely worth a visit if you are feeling peckish while in the area

my husband and I went to shopping at mustafa last night, after we have walked for hours in mustafa huge centre, we were hungry and decide to try the food in mustafa. the cashier told us there is a restaurant on rooftop. but we must first go down to level 2 and take the elevator from the vegetable section. (note, not every elevator has access to this rooftop restaurant, u must really work hard to find this one elevator, restaurant stay open until 1AM, but certain menu is only available until 8pm, many others available menu though, i was there around 11PM and can still order varierty of curries). i didnt expect a nice restaurant like a dome- glass restaurant on top of mustafa singapore, which reminded me a little bit of KONG restaurant in paris. anyway then we order saffron rice, fish curry, vege curry and tomato bellpepper paneer. the food was outstanding, my husband couldnt stop talking how delicious & fragrant it was. the food cost us 50ish SGD. the waiter is attentive and polite. totally worth it :) if you are a fan of indian cuisine, you must visit the restaurant!!

We happened to be here while shopping at Mustafa, when we were looking to have some snacks but ended up having dinner there. Located on the top floor of Mustafa, it is a great choice for Indian food. Cool ambient, vast menu & extraordinary service. We were served well by Mohit
3
They have an extensive menu. We tried their Indian and Indian-Chinese food, which were all good. Wasn't too huge on the ambiance though. Although there's a dome which gives you a view of the sky above, it's a little dark at night. The tables were also placed in a bit of a haphard manner across the restaurant. Service was just ok, nothing to shout about
1
Just went there this afternoon . Ordered masala dosa, samosa chat and dahi chat. The Papdi and samosa had rancid oil smell. The masala dosa was oily with a lot of masala filled in. Couldn't finish it.
5
When I had no friends I thought why not try and kill myself with currie and it nerdy worked as I am in hospital and now I have a disease and now I have over 500 friend so thank you Kebabs and Curries
4
An eating discovery that is definitely worth going to lunch, with two, with family, friends or colleaguesThere is the buffet, looks and smells very tasty next time we go for it!We have eaten a la card,Just delicious, oh you eat indian food, So you should be able to eat the spicy herbal mi
4
Me and my family have done a dinner.They have good staff and waiters.Service is good Food also good ,most are indian food if you like indian food you can go there.Environment is nice feeling as like Natural.Problem is little bit expensive and difficult to find this place
4
Went there yesterday afternoon. The environment was great. Had trees and other plants in the air-conditioned dome. Ordered 'Mutton Mysore' for lunch. The meal was super tasty, the mutton was juicy but without much gravy. The biryani rice was good too.On the downside, the food took a long time to arrive. Plus when it did, there was no rice. They said you have to order separately. I expected a bit more mutton. All in all, great place to dine, and I recommend it
5
This was my 2nd visit in 2 weeks!We arrived before noon on a very hot day & asked the waiter for a "cool" table. Staff promptly brought us to a table in front of the air cooler & turned it on immediately. We were the only customers at that point.We had the Punjabi Samosa as starter & were surprised by its size. It was almost 3" tall & bursting with well spiced potato fillings. The sweet dressing that came with it was fantastic pairing!We ordered the naan basket & were rewarded with very nutty sweet kashmiri naan; crisp plain nana; fragrant butter naan & delicious garlic nana!The Jhinga Masala prawn curry in thick gravy was so good that we finished every bit with the naan! And the mango lassi as well as lime mint soda complimented the whole meal perfectly
1
Even though the setting is quite nice, the service and the quality of food totally lets it down. They are grossly understaffed. And the food is either tasteless or too oily to begin with. We ordered Crab meat & prawn kebabs for starters and I could not taste any meat in that. It was made up of gram flour and potatoes only. Shocking! The tandoori chicken was decent but the rest of the main course was just truckload of spices, chilli, color and oi
5
This place had the most amazing Mutton Peshawari dish I've had in a long time. My meal was fulfilling, fresh and delicious. I would personally recommend this place to anyone who wants to try a wide variety of Indian, Indo-chinese and Pakistani delicacies. Definitely visit.Convenient location, and moderately priced
4
The meal is delicious, service okay, beautiful glass dome, ambiance is a tad too dim for my liking. Went on a weekday night with a group of 6, following my girlfriend's recommendation. We had 5 naans of different flavours, as well as a kebab (MALAI MURGH KABAB), mutton biryani, chicken tikka masala, and butter chicken. Like them all, not disappointed with my favourite butter chicken.We spent S$19 per pax, with a non-alcoholic drink each
5
Decided to try it out... environment wise, it's a awesome, thou it was dark with very low lighting. Ordered a mutton briyani and naan with mutter Panner for the mrs.. Mutton briyani was quite dry but tasty. The mutton was soft and really tasty. However, the mutter Panner masala was extremely spicy.Thou service was quite slow... but it's a nice place to dine..
5
This is the best indian resto in singapore.There were some schemes like A cup of Tea free between afternoon.One can try all south indian dishes here.
4
I have been here twice, ordered different dishes each time and love all of them , especially those on the last page of menu, the curries on that page are special selection ; very yummy !!
3
Been awhile since my last visit here, sadly they no longer served their awesome hyderabadi biryani. The replacement somewhat fell short from the previous to my personal opinion but it was still good. Since they've opened, very little improvements have been done, dinner is still very dark and gloomy. This is not romantically dim lilted, it's dark. Then there is echo and conversation sound bounced because of the dome. This can get a little uncomfortable. Depending on where you're seated, imagine hearing conversations from two table across as if they are right beside you, makes you wonder who is hearing ours. Fortunately most of the menu are intact and quality has not been compromised. they have nice waiters and waitresses that are quick to attend to our needs. I wasn't able to take much good pic this time as it was too dark for any of my pictures to turn out good. next time perhaps
4
Not many would be aware of this hidden gem and that TOP that it sits on TOP of one of the most frequented supermarkets in Singapore - The Mustafa. The signboards are very discreet inside the shopping halls and you probably would get to know only if your friends or family have recommended.It's a large sized restaurant that can probably hold at least 60-70 tables at once. Over the weekends it's so crowded that the pure ambience of a rooftop could be destroyed by the sheer chitchat noise. But I will still give it to this place since they have been able to maintain a good taste. They are quite famous for their Mughlai dishes and Muttons which you don't often get here. I am a fan of their Dal Bukhara ( The slow cooked dal).The price points are pretty modest like any other Lil India eat out. You can expect 40$ for two.
4
We tend to bring our friends and family there after a visit of little india area. Kebab and curry is on the rooftop of mustapha centre so the restaurant is quite big and pleasant. You have plenty of choices and it's a good place to try some indian cuisine from various areas (north, south..) Some might complaint that it's a bit pricey compared to the restaurant around but it still ok for the quality of the food
5
This restaurant sits atop the Mustafa Centre in Singapore's "Little India". It sits in an odd domed structure on the centre's rooftop, but offers superb Indian and Chinese food items. Everything is fresh, original and enjoyable. At some times there is a buffet available, but skip the buffet and order items directly from the menu. It's not a bargain, but well worth the prices.
3
This is the restaurant opened on the roof top of Mustafa Center in Singapore.The original restaurant is down the street but I think for the convenience of Mustafa Center shoppers, they opened this on the roof top.As expected, signage to get to the restaurant is extremely poor, but as always, you can ask, more than a few people, then finally you will get to the right area of Mustafa Center and the right elevator that will take you to the roof top.It is a pretty simple place, fairly clean looking. The buffet has about 10-12 different vegetarian and none vegetarian dishes.Curry and tikka chicken and basmati rice were really good.Its not expensive, eat all you can. I had lunch, it was fine. If ur in the vicinity of Mustafa Center, this may be a good choice for lunch maybe even dinner since they may be open until midnight or so.There are so many other Indian restaurants in the area but this one is quiet well known serving the tourists as well as the locals.If you do not want the buffet, there is also a menu which you can pick and choose.It had the weirdest sign at the entrace immediately after you come out of the elevator.There were some sample dishes on the table and a sign saying DO NOT SPIT IN THE AREA or something like that. Check out the pic.Kind of funny but disgusting at the same time. But spitting in some countries is customary and very normal
5
The naan, chicken tikka, palak paneer is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! We tried 3 types on naan which is plain naan, garlic cheese naan and garlic naan. We also ordered something like a tandorri / kebab platter which has a few types of chicken, fish and also prawn. But take note that this place is a bit on the pricey side, but to me it is totally worth it! The staff was great and very attentive too. Will surely be back
4
Located on the rooftop of Mustafa is this restaurant that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating is inside a glass dome which looks spectacular during day light. It's large sized and can accommodate at least 40 tables.Price point is average like most other restaurants and portion size is good enough. I would call this a meat lovers paradise and they good array of meat dishes. Same time a good spread of vegetarian options too.Expect an average of 25$ per person for a 3 course mea
5
A Nice place where we can just relax and treat our taste Buds with Good Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi food. the place is clean and the service is Effective. The Rotis and Lamb Curry are Authentic and gives you a real Indian Taste. Staying in Singapore for a Long Time, I always crave for Good Indian Food, and when it come to having good Meat outside then It ought to be Kebabs and Curries
4
We found this restaurant by accident, and what a pleasant surprise.
Great setting,m service and food, really good value too.
2
Located at 7th floor at Mustafa centre, Did not like the overall ambience. Food was just OK. not many options, not recommended
4
Food was good. Service was excellent. Try to sit in AC as they are bot comfortable and the price is also reasonable.

I read a bunch of reviews before going here. Most cited the great food, ambiance and modernity of the glass dome. Cool, worth a trip then....{scratching sound as needle removed from record}The reality is that this restaurant is pretty hard to find, not just the building but also elevator to get there, go in Entrance 6 of the huge building and you might get in easier.We went at about 7pm on a weekend and it was quiet, not a good sign. No seating option was given and we were marched off to the dome and placed in a center table. Knowing that these can be noisy I asked to move and reluctantly we were allowed to. The dome itself is not modern and new, its old, dirty and needs work. You need a fan here on warm days for sure as its quite hot in there. Ambiance was nil, nix and nada. Sadly most of the time I couldnt attract a waiter for any help but where we did they seemed ok, tho were visibly disappointed when we didnt order drinks. Food was pretty average and nothing special. The prices were pretty much Sydney prices, so its out of step with the local area for sure. Ouch!On leaving we looked around and found the delightful roof terrace which was also pretty empty. What a shame they didnt let us sit here. Sure there is no view due to the walls but its more modern and much more comfortable than the dome.So, I wouldnt bother eating here again. Little India has plenty of other restaurants that will be easier to find and more enjoyable. Dont for one minute think this is a new hip and happening modern place, it is not
5
I have been eating at this place for the last 5 years and there isn't a single occasion when we have been disappointed. In fact during some weeks, we eat at this place 4-5 times. Food is great, and the staff is very helpful as they accommodate our request to make it less spicy. The Indo-Chinese food, and the Indian food is excellent, which combined with freshly made naan are superb choice. My family always looks forward to eat at this restaurant
4
The usual Little India curry meal used to be one of the hundreds of Northern or Southern Indian restaurants along those streets. The atmosphere at street level is definitely authentic with a good mixed from Bangla/Pakistan/North and Sth Indian, you got that all there and its at its best. For a change we decided to take the lift right up and dine outdoors. the Vegetable Pulao was nice and you can't really go wrong with rice from any Indian restaurant, its veg flavoured but not much else, still its nice to go with the spicy Kheeme Mutter, and the Pan Fried fish, 2 sliced smeared with spices was done just right and not over cooked. We later had the Chocolate Mousse which I should have known rightly not to order. We had an Indian Chendol style of dessert which was layered Green red white topped with Ice cream. That was pretty authentic but not very tasty maybe its a little too sweet for us. The Terrace on the roof is surrounded by a 1.5 metre wall so you can't see too well seated down (safety concern for the higher wall) , plenty of trees all round and there is even a kids fountain that they can entertain themselves, and if you do that bring a change of clothes for them. But its all well very safe.Fans are provided to keep you cool, but can get warm without one. If I wanted to entertain in a cooler environment, there is a air-conditioned closed area which does not have the Terrace atmosphere. Still you can walk out and walk back in to soak in the sights of the city view

If you happen to be shopping at Mustafa and would like to sample some reasonably good India food, you should check out this restaurant on the 7th floor, at the roof top of Mustafa Shopping center. During lunch time, they serve a decent buffet, at night they revert to serving food through ala carte menu. They have a good selection of North and South Indian dishes and curries. The naan bread was really fresh too. Service is reasonably prompt and attentive. Overall a good experience having tried both their lunch and dinner
3
Bought a few naans, tandoori chicken and spinach and cheese (palak paneer). Food was average, nothing special except the naans are a little oily. Tandoori saved the meal for us as it was pretty good. Service was average, nothing special.Price wise is higher than usual. Paid about $50 for 2 Pax eating. Reckon I should have paid a visit to the sakunthalas below instead. TOP TIP- don't sit in the middle of the dome , there's an irritating echo when your table speaks that resonates through the whole restaurant.

hi.. we visited this place post our grocery shopping at mustafa for Tea Time. We ordered Masala Teas which were good to our liking. Also we ordered Samosa Chaat which was good (though the extra SEV we askd for was not at all crunchy and fresh). They have options for indoor and outdoor dining.. make sure you opt for the outdoor dining... enjoying the cool breeze and singapore skyline... It would make your tea more delightful.. P.S.. my husband visited this place few times for the ambience and samosa chaat..
4
We opted for the lunch buffet, though there is an alacarte option for those who cannot do justice to the buffet. We were a group of 3( my folks and I) and were famished after spending time shopping in Mustafa. It is located on the rooftop and has ample dining space. They have a special section for large tour groups. The ambiance is nothing to write about except that it feels spacious and not claustrophobic like the average Little India restaurant.There was a mix of tourists, locals and some office crowd on a lunch break, The best part is that you can bring your paid merchandise from Mustafa with the trolley into the restaurant.The buffet offers a decent variety of rice, mutton, fish, two types of chicken, salad, vegetarian dishes like dhania paneer, plain naan,papad, some kebabs, dal and for dessert there was an Indian option called Gajar Halwa. Frankly, the salad looked and tasted a bit dry. The vegetarian preparations were better than the non vegetarian ones. Most of the non veg dishes had a meaty after taste and was quite oily. We ordered a rumali roti and dal makhni which was absolutely heavenly.The dal comes in a small bucket which is very cute and tasteful.Personally, I feel this place offers some fantastic veg food but the non veg can be unpredictable. In my last visit, I had a veg food and it was pretty awesome. The staff were attentive and usually clear the tables promptly. We found the place clean and hygienic unlike some joints in Little India. They have a set of clean loos and separate ones for ladies and gents. There is thankfully no loud music that can sometimes stop people from being able to hear themselves. Do note that the Dasani bottle kept on the table is chargeable and not complimentary. There are adequate aircons and fans plus a covered roof, to make the dining experience not at the mercy of the weather. The prices are midrange and is worth the experience.Try the meetha paan to freshen your breath after a heavy meal. I would definitely consider revisiting the place again
5
Great place for friends and family, good Indian foods. Spicy and non spicy, the mutton curry and the paneer pakori is nice.
5
one must and had dinner at Kebabs and Curries at Mustafa centre and had galoti kebabs and rogan josh
4
Good was good and staff were friendly as they were entertaining my baby and she was happy :) We ordered biryani and naan,Dhaal,chicken and taste good will visit again.
5
Ordered the butter chicken, cauliflower, naan and a few other dishes (not helpful I know but my friend who's a pro at this ordered the standard dishes) and they were all very good! Bill worked out to 90ish with them charging 5 bucks for a lime juice. Would encourage one to stick to order their tea instead or just have the Dasani water on the table. I want to go back for butter chicken again
1
We went for a late night dinner with friends .. though the food was tasty. After a while of dining we noticed a rat running across us . We were in shock. and immediately got up from the seats.. when we informed the manager about it, and we saw another rat running again. The worst part here is that the manager on duty was giving an excuse that it was normal for the rats to be running around as they had just done a pest control fumigation a coupLe of days ago. Was that suppose to be an explanation given? shame on them.. then shouldn't the restaurant be closed for a couple of days till its safe to be reopen for business?Had a very bad experience with this restaurant and never are we going back there again nor recommending it to anyone!!
3
We were so exited to dine here,specially after reading so many good reviews here on TripAdvisor..and so we followed countless direction arrows to that particular lift which takes you to roof top..Being vegetarians, I looked for vegetable kebab..but its not on the list folks.. Not finding many options, we thought its better to play safe and we ordered paneer tikka and Mysore Dosa . Both of them were oily and very average in taste..You can easily find much better food at that price in Little IndiaGoing the food taste , rating should have been poor but polite staff and overall set up makes it average. .
5
Absolutely delightful.We had an unexpected surprise when we stopped for a fast lunch on the rooftop restaurant in Mohammed Mustafa store.Served speedily by smiling helpful staff, among the delicious food we chose from the menu I feel I must recommend the paper dosa, the Kashmiri naan and the Malai Kofta accompanied by a super Mango Lassi.I have to say that being able to enjoy a delicious meal in 15 minutes enabled us to face an important appointment with a great attitude! Surprise ....most affordable too
3
Finding the way to Mustafa's rooftop Indian restaurant took a while as it is at the end of Syed Alwi road, or at the back end of the complex. Take the lift to level R, and you will find this large Indian restaurant located on two bays.Lunch can be a wee bit hot, as the roof top is made of clear glass. Find a nice table or corner that's cooling.Menu has a wide selection and the traditional items are a good choice. They have a wide selection of bread, rice, meats and curry dishes. I opted for the paper dosa dish which came looking like a large paper foil and accompanied sambal, sauces and vegetable curry. The mutton vindaloo was delicious and the meat was tender and well cooked with potatoes.Service is prompt and food is served hot. If not for the heat from the roof ceiling, the meal was good. Suggest better directional signs from the ground level
3
Came here for the buffet. Location is great as it is located at mustafa centre. Took the lift up to the 6th level which is also labeled the R floor. I assume it means rooftop. There is an indoor and outdoor dining area. Buffet spread is acceptable however very little choices. Some food available there is Briyani, Naan, Kebab chicken and fish, salads, some of the gravy. There are about 30 or less dishes including sauces so it wasn't really great. However food tastes good therefore it is acceptable. Was expecting more food to be available. Barely any desserts too. However food is good for the price paid. Overall, food was so-so. Eating a-la-carte is much more recommended. Staffs are very efficient at clearing the plates
4
The Serving Staf was a little lazy, But the cooks in the kitchen must be a proffesional team! Amazing kebabs....mutton and curries! The bread is very tasty. . prices are very acceptable! This was our first time here! very busy! but that means the food is good? doesn't it?
4
Our hotel staff recommended this Indian restaurant and it was great. Typical Indian food (south and north cuisine). Very tasty and cheap. Majority of guest are Indians. We will go there again.
5
We never knew about this restaurant before after so many times to mostafa. the food was amazing, average price, comfortable dining area, friendly staff and pork free.
try their butter chicken & chicken briyani. fully aircondition and spacious.
2
Been here a couple of times because of its great location right above Mustafa shopping center but it will be the last time. Although the food is great, I saw a mouse running across the ledge near the buffet spread! And that was before our food arrived so I totally lost all appetite. Please do something about the hygiene in your premises before the health authorities shut you down
5
We had a beautiful meal here after half a day wandering the Mustafa centre. The place is a little hard to get to - located on the 7th floor but you have to find one of the two lifts that actually goes that high, and be in the right building of course - if you get lost (and it's pretty easy in Mustafas, just ask one of the staff & they'll help you out)Ambience was very nice, decor pleasant, the staff friendly and attentive and the food - yummo. Some of the nicest Indian cuisine we have ever eaten and well priced too
5
I go to this restaurant almost every week, so YES I love this place! And no I'm not Indian - I'm French, and it's not even near my place!The best is to go there at night and to sit outside on their terrace to have a nice view. The staff is lovely and will know how to advise you - especially when you have no clue what the names mean and when you can't take spicy food.My personal recommendation would be to start with the butter chicken (murgh makhani) and daal makhani, but their malai kofta & ghost sagwala are also excellent! And there are many many more.And don't forget their mango lassi which is the best I've ever had!
4
This restaurant is located in the top floor of a giant store that sells EVERYthing. You will take never ending escalators and when you reach the top you will be greeted with a delicious buffet full of curries, chutneys, rice and breads but NO kebabs!!! Delicious food, so flavorful and plentiful and I had a belly-full. I'd recommend this place
4
went here to have dinner, we had lamb briyani in a pot and some fine tandoori chickens and naan breads. i should say, this restaurant has got the finest experience cooks ever. the tandoori chicken was soo tender, naan was soft. the lamb briyani was thumbs up..... yummy. its really nice and worth it to eat here. they have many north indian and south indian food, try this out, you will never be disappointed
1
We were doing our monthly grocery shopping at Mustafa Centre and since it was dinner time, chose to go here for dinner. We ordered chicken malai kebab, prwan curry, cheese pakoras, vegetable curry and nans / rotis. The kebab was rock hard and excessively salty, the prawns under cooked, the vegetable curry had sugar in it and the cheese pakoras too oily. All in all a very bad dining experience.
3
We visited as a family group of 6. Our order was wrong and they insisted we still pay for the extra drinks etc. The waiter insisted that we "try" spicy cauliflower and then when the bill came we were charged $18 for the privilege of trying a new dish, so say "no" to any suggestions as it is a way to gauge money from tourists. The mango lassi were nice. The ambience was nice with the waterfalls etc. Overall it was quite an expensive meal though
3
Little India is buzzing with Indian eateries and kebabs & curries just adds up to the queue. Perhaps their concept of lunch buffet at SGD 20++ might be an economical option to try a variety of Indian dishes. That said, food taste is run of the mill. Now chicken dhansak is what we tried and it was basically, chicken cooked in lentils. Not exactly what it is meant to be, it tasted different perhaps because only tuar daal was used, yet it was a good job. But this item is off the menu so we got to know the price later and it was disappointing to know that it was way high-priced. The lamb biryani was somehow not at all worthy, especially the lamb pieces. Overall, it is basic restaurant with basic food taste. Nothing special.
3
We heard lots of good things about Kebabs and Curries but unfortunately it was quite disappointing. The food itself was average and the restaurant could be cleaner.
Nevertheless, they do an excellent mango lassi
2
Food quality is just ok. It is too oily for me, didn't taste fresh. Staff is friendly and service is good.
5
This is one of the best places I have tried and brought my wheel chair bound mother. We enjoyed the foood and service here. When you visit Mustafa's it is highly recommended that you have a go here to taste the food and masala tea.
2
Went to their rooftop restaurant . Ambience is very good .Service is below par. Food was not good . Tried their tomato soup as waiter insisted and recommended . It was horrible . Then came the mutton rogan Josh . Mutton was raw. Ice tea had to be replaced . Nans became like papad in 5 mins . and spent 40 $ . Goto Usman restaurant instead . No ambience but food will be awesome at less than half the rate
4
My family and I ate here while visiting Little India. The food was excellent as was the service. The quantity of the food was very good.The location is at the top of the Mustafa Centre, bit hard to find though.It is child friendly as well.The only downside was the cost of the meal. For budget minded tourists, this is not the place to go. For those who can splurge for the one meal, then go here. You won't be disappointed
4
Went there for dinner at their rooftop restaurant. Heard not so good reviews but was pleasently surprised. Ambience is good, big area, polite and prompt service and wide variety of dishes offered (North indian, South Indian and Indo-Chinese cuisine).Veg manchurian (chinese style) was surprisingly good. main dish of Mushroom-peas veggie was just average but quantity was good.We ordered assorted Naan basket and requested without butter, even then Kashmiri naan was very tasty.Food was delivered hot. And bottled water is charged only .90 cents, never seen any restaurant selling branded mineral water this cheaply. By the way, prices are very reasonable.Good place to go with Family
5
Been there a few times already but today was just great ! Forget about a special ambience when you sit inside but the food is just amazing. We had several dishes like butter chicken, mutton mysore, mutton sheekh kebab, vegg byrjani rice and dal makhani plus butter naan n popadum. All near perfection and very tasty ! Some drinks on top and this all for SGD 88 - great food great value - will come again.... For those with lower budget - they have alternative a great buffet for sgd 25 per person
4
The restaurant is located on the rooftopof Mustafa Centre and is very big (good option to come with a big group). I really liked the huge menu (veg and non veg options, cuisine from several regions of India). Portions are quite big and not expensive at all. The service was fast and the waiter very friendly, and gave us good advices. I had naan, mango lassi, tandoori chicken and tandoori cauliflower - awesome but a bit spicy
4
Went to kebab n curries at Serangoon (restaurant is located at the rooftop of Mustafa Centre)......for me personally I enjoyed eating the cut ice cream mix with walnut (if I am not wrong the name of that dessert is kulfi)......it's a must try !!! The rest of the food nice n the portion is quiet big so don't order too much when u first place your order.
5
This restaurant is at the roof top of Mustafa and is slightly away from the attraction of Little India restaurants!!But needless to say it is one of my favourite places to eat as the area is spacious with roof garden and the food delicious with pricing kept in the affordable range even for Ala Carte dishes. There is a buffet option available which we didn't try. The service is quick and professiona
4
Nice Asian Food served in a good manner. Environment is also good and nice views on top of Mustafa Center. For first timers the floor signs are good to find location of the restaurant.
5
Fantastic food with great service. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and would definitely recommend to others. Probably the best meal I've eaten in Singapore

This restaurant is situated on the rooftop of Mustafa centre. We went there for lunch and they have a buffet on between 12 and 3pm. The cost was 20SD each and the food was excellent with a good selection.

This is a restaurant on the 7 th floor of the mustafer center . It is very convienent . U can park the car ,shop and dine at the same place . Food I'd good and tasty . The place is also comfortable .

This is a rooftop restaurant located at Mustafa Centre. It is one of the best Indian restaurants where you will get non-veg food in that area. If you are staying at Hotel Park Royal and are a Kebab lover, then this is the closest thing you can have. You do have ala carte as well as set lunch and dinner menus here. The best thing is can wind up your shopping at Mustafa Centre and just head to the 7th floor when hungry. I landed here during lunch time and rather than going for the heavy set lunch, just went for the Kebab platter. At a price of approx. SGD 28 this is the best kebab platter I have ever dad at such excellent price. The quality of meat and sea food offered is also very good.Overall a very nice restaurant to visit when you hanging around Little India during your Singapore visit

Now is there anyone who comes to Singapore and does not visit The Harrods of Singapore that is called Momed Mustapha??From a pin to almost every thing in this world called merchandise one can buy if has the courage to rub shoulders with crowds that emit a strong BO!! But well best is to wear a mouth mask and get the goodies that are genuine not perfumes though leave that for duty free ! But I am not here to sing the praises of the shopping but the nice Kebabs curries Indian food from all parts of IndiaSo we landed up on the roof top and enjoyed a platter of assorted kebabs biryani Indian hot fresh breads drank yogurt drinks ate even vegetables everything wasDelicious and just greatWe were 6 of us and when the bill arrived we were astonished all under $ 100 and we even had to ask them what we could not eatThe staff was friendly yes it's noisy it's not got any ambience but the quality of food taste makes up for i
2
Had our company buffet dinner here and was the worst company dinner we ever had. We promised ourselves that we would never go there for any meals ever. Quality of food was tasteless and costly. Waiters never top up the dishes or even our drinks when it was running low. There was very little items for the price paid. Service was utterly bad and the sound system was clearly very bad
3
The only thing that seems to be work for them is that they serve Pakistani/Indian Food at the rooftop of perhaps the most Pakistani/Indian population dense area (Mustafa Center). The food is average at best. The portions are very smalls and prices are way too much for what they are serving. The food service was also slow. The do offer buffet for 20 dollars in weekdays and 25 dollars on weekends. From my experience, if you HAVE to eat there, i would recommend to go for buffet. Otherwise there are so many restaurants around the area, you can skip it
5
Harjinder is a staff worth mentioning for this restaurant. She goes the extra mile to make our dinner such as an amazing experience.Weekend buffet is at SGD25 NETT and food is amazing. Sure the spread may not be huge but it does meet your indian food craving. Enjoyed the muttonm, fish, chicken along with the Naan and pudding for dessert.Will recommend and return

We were pleasantly surprised with this unexpected discovery while visiting Little India. Kebabs and Curries is located at the rooftop of Mustafa Shopping Centre. It is very spacious and air conditioned. They serve a good mix of north and south Indian cuisine. Food is good, prices reasonable too. I say skip the buffet and order ala carte
5
A must do if you are at Mustafa centre, the hotel is on the roof top. The Portions of food are generous and the taste is awesome.
3
Cold food which i believe is re-heated and presentation makes you wonder what did you just order ! They are plenty of restaurants outside Mustafa Center. Dive into them and enjoy !
5
Amazing service and customer service :) Chef Ayub Khan is talented and a master of his crafted! Recommended to anyone craving Indian food!
5
Awesome food and great service! The butter chicken and the chicken lollipop is a must-try. I had a wonderful birthday thanks to them.
3
Preety good place to visit for Indian Food with nice ambience.
Buffet is quiet ok with the price you pay.
Many mouth watering dishes in menu that can be tried.
3
Naan, fried vegetables and daal were OK. There was also a buffet choice available at $16 per person. Good service.The freakiest thing about the restaurant is the acoustics in the domed indoor area. We could clearly hear the conversation from several tables away, situated under almost the highest point of the ceiling
4
i had been here twice for dinner buffet.The restaurant is at 7th floor.first they welcomee you with smile.the ambience is cool.not much items in buffet menu but has good taste...the fish curry was great and nice rotis with sweet kheer.the service is also good worth visit...regardsSri
5
I like to Dine-in here as it offers both indoor (AirConditioned) as well as Outdoor (roof top) seating. Open area dining is my favorite. The price of the food is not so high compared to many other Restaurants in Little India. It is a fine dining restaurant with affordable price Range. If you want to try North Indian and South Indian dishes in a room top restaurant in Singapore, probably, you have very limited options. This is One of thos
2
Well I had visited the restaurant 2 years ago and had a great dinner that time. Hence I was excited to go there again for a lovely vegetarian dinner. Since it is a rooftop restaurant in Mustafa, it has huge space. But that's it! There is nothing memorable and cheerful about the ambiance. It is dimly lit with not so good cutlery which must be clean but does not look so. The service was OK and better than anything else there. The food was simply terrible. We ordered kebabs which were little soggy, not properly cooked and not so tasty. We also ordered some schezwan noodles with manchurian gravy. Well when you say schezwan in an Indian restaurant, it is meant to be spicy and hot which is was not. The machurian balls simple had no taste at all. We also ordered some rabri which again was nothing but disappointing in flavor, odor and appearance. In short, there was nothing tantalizing about the place
3
There are better places in Little india who value customer and their money.The only good thing about this restaurant is location when you are shopping in Mustafa. I already tried Khansama and other restaurants in little India, but thought of giving a try to this as we were tired and getting late. It turned out to be a very wrong decision and we ended up eating wrong order by paying premium price. Menu has good number of options but no quality in food. I don't mind paying $90 of bill but not for something I did not order. There is a open garden restaurant and covered one with aircon. We went to covered one as staff didn't tell us about open one. Maybe that one is for smokers. Though 70% of tables were empty they insisted to seat in a congested corner seat. After placing order when the food actually came I was surprised that the couple of dishes were wrong. When asked waitress she said I repeated order and can not change now. Really?? They play a very loud music, if she is not able to hear me how she expect me to hear what she repeated? I did not argue much as it was late and the way she responded was very rude. This is not the first time something like this happened to me but waiters do change the order out of courtesy or at least apologies for inconvenience. But nothing like that happened. Be careful when you order as I have noticed from other reviews this happens frequently here
3
Pros: Convenient if accompanied by a loaded trolley at Mustafa. Service is not too bad.
Cons: Food is pretty tasteless, just loaded with colour. Sometimes, it is bland and extremely oily.
2
People who work there are lazy don't clear the place don't ask for order on time. Food Is good but atmosphere is bad
2
located at the top of musthafa shopping mall.
poor quality food .
worst service.
not meant for tourists.
5
This is a rooftop restaurant that serves a la carte food during weekdays and serves buffet dinner during weekends. We were there for their buffet dinner and we love their Indian cuisine, especially their Naan and Tandoori Chicken. Reasonable prices with romantic ambience, worth a return.
5
The Kebabs 'n Curry restaurant sitting on the rooftop of the new addition to the ever expanding Mustafa Shopping centre is full of pleasant surprises. The most recent of which is their new menu which now features snapshots of many of their more popular dishes as well as including many new dishes which I'm going to sample on subsequent visits. Whether vegetarian or serious carnivore, they have have delicious dishes for all palates. My favorites for dinner are the lamb kebabs, Madras curry chicken, vegetables jalfreizie with briyani rice. If you need an afternoon break from the shopping madness below pop upstairs for one of their chatts and a freshly made mango lassie. Whether for a snack or a meal, this restaurant gets my vote for one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore because they are clean, consistently good, and offer a high quality, beautiful range of tastes and flavours from all over India. This is even better when you consider that the portions are generous enough to be shared by two people with healthy appetites. The service, while not five star, is efficient and prompt which is better than I would expect at a place with such reasonable and affordable prices. But the best feature for me is the open rooftop dining section of the restaurant which only opens at 7pm. It offers lovely breezes and is one of the few spots in Singapore where it is possible to enjoy a meal under a full moon with someone special.
5
The rooftop restaurant has outdoor and indoor, both are comfortable for groups.They provide ala-carte and buffet menus.Since I visited North India last year, this restaurant serves the closest one to the real deals in India. I think this is because they have all the correct authentic spices which are difficult to be gotten here in Singapore.Very delicious Indian food and affordable. My favourite North Indian restaurant by far.It is Halal
4
We got a chance to sample Indian cuisine at this restaurant last July 2015. The restaurant isn't really hard to find because it is at the roof deck of the Mustafa Centre but the maze of escalators going there makes a bit of a challenge. The chicken biryani is just delicious! Caution: if your tongue is still uninitiated to spicy food, tell the waiter before hand to make the dish NOT SPICY
5
The food is excellent with a very wide range of dishes to choose from.It is located on the roof top of Mustafa center and hence a very appropriate place to eat before/after shopping spree!The buffet is sumptuous and tasteful. Ala carte is always recommended.One should not miss out to try the desserts like falooda and pan
4
Have been to this place at Mustafa Market twice last week.  The food I had was very good, especially the Fish dishes. Though, a point less for the service. At peak hours, its crowded and thus service takes a toll. Its a good place to eat if you are around Mustafa Market and has a lot of visitors during lunch and dinner because it is right inside the biggest supermarket in this part of Singapore.Should definitely try if you are around this little India part of Singapore.
3
This can be your final halt after you are done with the exhausting shopping at Mustafa. This is on the 7th floor and is in the new block, so you really have to ask a lot before you reach the right elevator. There are no clear instructions and in Mustafa, if you have been there its difficult to find one amongst the millions of goods stored there. This is not a fine dine place, however they have done up the terrace fairly well, and got tower ACs to ensure you dont get eaten up by the sultry weather. Prices are of a mid range restaurant. I basically ordered north Indian and south Indian snacky food and the parantha was nice and in good portions.However, the dosa sambhar did not suit my wife and she had a tummy issue in the evening because of it. I would therefore rate it at 3 stars instead of 4. Service is good, but not with a smile
3
expensive, but lot of varieties and great atmosphere, especially when raining. takeaway wait limit must improve. shortage of manpower.
4
Amazing food really I went for my birthday party there.first I thought it would e a useless place and expensive also but the food was delicious.
5
Good food and very nice ambiance. My kids really enjoyed their naan bread. Me and my husband ordered their kebab platter, mutton briyani and vegetable. We really enjoyed our meal. It's a bit pricey but worth it. Will come back again.
2
Kebabs and curries is well liked and preffered by those who want to conclude their shopping at Mustafa with a meal. Our latest visit to the restaurant was not very pleasing as the food was slightly spoilt. We had ordered aalu methi and paneer with lemon soda and chicken. The bill amounted to a whooping SGD 78.00 . Moreover the allu methi was not very impressive and tasted stale. The tandoori rotis were far from the usual crispy ones and were quite soggy
4
Enjoyable ambience with family and friends in the evening. It's open till very late hours - 1 am. Service of the main waitress was great and she made customizations to our order to taste. Best service but taste could be better - the food tasted average. We ordered biriyani, roti, haleem, fried noodles, and chicken lolipops. For dessert we ate rabri, firni and ice cream these tasted average too. Hope they improve on the cooking to compete with other similar restaurants in the area
4
After your Mustafa shopping ,this is the closest place to fuel up yourself.located at top,this is a nice resturant.Ambiance is good with decent food & value for money quantity.Must try malai kebbabs there,surely you will enjoy it.Didn't tried buffet there,hope that will be greatKeep munchin
4
Went there as 2 couples and a child, and had little to complain. Kebabs (Mutton Seekh, Chicken Reshmi) were excellent, and gravies (dal, Mutton curry) and breads were great too. A meal for 4.5 people for SGD 98, you wouldn't call that expensivem would you?A good visit right next to Mustafa centre- this place is owned by a Lakhnavi and is at the end of the building blocks owned by Mustafa...do visit and you won't be disappointed
2
This restaurant is a epitome of disgrace when it comes to buffet.. worst ever food after 3 times of trial I can confidently say dont ever visit with your family. Cold Naan, tasteless curry, desert is a mess(exception is jamoon if you are lucky). Check out Ras-bites or Riverwalk tandoor they all serve good rotis.The two stars given is only for al-carte food is hot still tasteless though !! I would say try Copper Chimney or Sankranthi right opposite to mustafa.. !!This is the review provided by 8 people visited 6 times to try out all the verities..veg and non-veg
3
It's difficult to write a review of kebabs and curries as the place has always surprised me, the taste keeps changing, probably their chefs also do !!There are times when the food is awesome and there are times when the naan is half cooked, the curry is bland and even hair found in their honey potatoes (needed to be replaced). The taste of their dishes keep changing every time. worth visiting only if you are too tired to go elsewhere and just want to eat after long hours of shopping at Mustafa.
3
It is located at top floor of Mustafa center. If your on mustafa shopping its convenient to plan your food.The al-carte is not big hole for your pockets good selection of veg and Non-veg items. If your planning a Buffet dinner it is bit expensive its not worth for $25, especially if your a vegetarian. The another thing didn't like the dome concept its very noisy inside even though food is tasty cannt enjoy. If we visit again prefer to sit outside dome
5
As singapore is expensive but for us Indians you must try this restaurant try the bihari kabab there service is so good and all indian and pakistani staffs..inside mustafa just shop shop and shop and eat..here only...
4
This place has good Indian food.
Located above Mustafa, kinda convenient place to have food right after shopping.
Rates are reasonable compared to other North Indian Eateries in the same locality.
Ambience is good and staff are friendly
4
This is a restaurant on roof top near Mustafa center in Little India.We went there for dinner and requested Butter Chicken, Chicken Biryani and one vegetarian Indian Dish with Nan, the food was very good, well cooked. Overall, we enjoyed the service level of friendly , responsive staff and quality of food
4
We went to this place out of compulsion not choice however was a good dinnerFood Authentic Indian and Indian-Chinese stuff and tasty (you know it is the real deal when you are ordering in Hindi to the waiter)Fast efficient serviceVaried menuLocationOn top of Mustafas - enough saidthe restaurant is on the rooftop - great location for dinner with lovely breeze blowingCostPretty ok - given eating out is pricey in SingThe thing that really worked for us - on late Sunday night , well late by Singapore standards 10:30 pm we wanted to have a family dinner outside but found out most non pub restaurants close shop in Sing by 10:45 pm on Sunday - however this restaurant stays open pretty late and though was far for us - it was the only optionSo people looking for a late night Desi meal in Singapore - KnC is the placeOh no alcoholic drinks and please do not order the iced tea - it sucke
5
I was in Singapore on a family trip and we visited this restaurant about 4-5 times. The restaurant serves Indian food the preparations were extremely good. We tried a variety of veg and non-veg dishes and each one turned out to be very well cooked and tasty. Indian breads and rice were great too. The staff is quick and efficient, good choice and variety in terms of food items on the menu and the food is served pretty fast after it's been ordered. As compared to many other places we visited for Indian food, this was reasonably priced with good food quality. The ambience is pretty pleasant as well. Overall it was an excellent experience and anyone fond of eating Indian food should visit this place.
4
We went for lunch since it was raining outside. Chose a-la-cart instead of buffet. Surprisingly they were very hood. Gobhi Manchoori was the best in Singapore we had so far. Other North Indian Dishes were excellent too. The inside dome place is very noisy though, it echoes a lot.
5
We have eaten here a bough 5 times now and think the staff are wonderful, the location above Mustafas is great for visitors to see this place, and the food is really good, priced for a expectation. We often eat more than we wanted to but thats because we can't stop ordering. The best thing we have had on the menu so far is the Aloo Mater which we had last time. Beautifully flavoured and tasty to boot. It can be hard to find so we drive to the above ground car park and use the lift to get there. If you are walking in, find the stickers on the floor or get in a lift in the second building and it is on the roof level.The staff remember all your order which is difficult if you are still ordering and changing your mind whilst ordering but they are good with their memory. One key thing to remember is that this is a alcohol free restaurant, so if you want a beer with your meal, you are in the wrong place. As gluten free vegetarians, this is outstanding food for us. Our kids also love the paper Thosi, and Idlis.We always sit in the dome, but have decided to sit outside next time as the weather is always nice when we go and feel like we might have missed the open air experience
4
Good food, delicious, ate till my tummy got so bloated. We had the fish head curry, prawn massala, mixed veg and fried chicken that I'm not sure of its name.Kudos to the servers, did a very good job in explaining about the food and recommended proper portion to us. They even get feedbacks regarding the food.Pricing wise, acceptable for its ambience, service and delicious food. Definitely will come back again for more
3
I visited Kebabs & Curries on a Sunday to try their lunch buffet - I had zero expectations, which turned out to be a good thing! Their vegetarian spread was quite good - soup, a few salads, Dahi Wada, Pakoda, mixed chutneys, a gravy, a dal, a dry subzi, a couple of varieties of rice, some noodles, naan, and dessert - Gulab Jamun in this case. The gravy (Paneer Kofta Lababdar) and dal were really flavoursome and mild on the spice. The rice (Peas Pulao) was average and the Naans could've been slightly fluffier. The Gulab Jamun was hot and soft and rounded up the meal pretty well.In all, I had quite a pleasant experience up on Mustaf's rooftop restaurant and would probably go back
5
Visited for lunch after a morning shopping in Mustafas. It was hard to find. We had to ask for directions and follow the stickers on the ground pointing the way past the food market section, and then up a lift right at one end of the store that takes you to the roof top. When we got out of the lift we thought it looked a bit too posh for a department store restaurant. The dome is massive. We decided on the a la carte menu but buffet is also available. Ordered the Chicken Chetinad and Mutton Handi and both were excellent, so tasty. We were served by a lovely young waitress who is an asset to that restaurant. She was concerned that the dishes may have been too spicy for us, but they were perfect. She even offered to take our photo which was a lovely touch. It was a lovely lunch that we were not expecting at a department store. Thoroughly recommend
4
Love the rooftop atmosphere. Great for friends & family dine in. Friendly staff tho service a bit slow but really enjoyed the food. Recommend to try chicken or mutton hydrebard briani & tea. Reasonable prices. Strongly recommend before or after u shop in Mustafa Centre
4
Good Place to have Best Food .
It is a good place with a good view from top of Mustafa Centre,
food quality was good and variety too.
4
We went there on monday (23-June) and really enjoyed the items that we ordered. I am happy with the quantity and quality of the food. Kebabs and Curries Management need to make it get going this Excellent Taste and Good Quantity.
4
Tried the kebabs at the restaurant over dinner, as well as the lunch buffet. The kebabs are quite good and recommended, and the biryani is good as well. Outdoor seating over dinner is nice, particularly on pleasant evenings.
4
We went to Kebab n curries many a time and love the food everytime we visit it. Initially we went here we were really impressed with the authentic taste and variety of north indian , Pakistani food and chaat but last couple of time food was average.Today we went again and ordered Mutton biryani, chicken handi, dal makhani, naan etc and must say mutton was yummy and the spices used in chicken handi were awesome.. Yummy !Overall bill was $50 which is very affordable for a family !Must try and enjoy the flavours
5
Given the location, we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived on the 7th floor as it was a contrast to the chaos in the rest of the Mustafa Centre. All the dishes we had (butter chicken, palak paneer, lamb korma, chicken tikka, naan, basmati, masala chai, mango lassi, watermelon juice) were top notch and as a meal, it was probably one of the best Indian meals we've had. We ordered a la carte but there was also a buffet option. It is a fairly casual restaurant offering good service and good value and we will definitely be going back

On July 23rd, after walking around Little India for about 30 minutes on deciding a place for dinner, we made a dreadful decision on choosing this restaurant. The restaurant was about empty when we reached there around 10 PM. We ordered for a Lucknowi Chicken biryani, Plain rice, Ghee rice and some madras chicken curry. The biryani tasted so tasteless and we were feeling so helpless, if it were in Chennai i would have returned it, I can make a better biryani than that for sure. Only reason we kept quiet was because we were tourists and we were very hungry. The plain rice was good lol, chicken curry was average and the ghee rice was rice soaked in ghee. We had to pay 2$ for some additional raitha, which just sounded insane to me, that too for a real bad raitha. After all the crappy /over prized (doesn’t matter) / tasteless food, all three of us were having heart burns and all kind of bad feelings for the next several hours. The next day we meet a friend from Singapore who has been there for about 11 years and tell him how bad the food was, he gives us a surprise. Not long ago, he had food with his family at kebabs and curries and his whole family was messed up. He had to take a day off work and his kids couldn’t go to school, due to the aftermath of having food here. After that conversation, i felt blessed that it was not too bad. This happenned to be our worst food experience in the 8 days of our vacation across three countries.Please - you guys got to improve on your quality
4
I have been to this restaurant both on weekdays and weekends. Weekends are always crowded and it won't be pleasant.For vegetarians:Food quality - GoodBuffet - AverageCost - Slightly expensivePlace - Very good, but you won't be to enjoy the place due to the excess crowd
5
We can certainly endorse this restaurant for some mouth watering food and sumptuous chats .Although the best part about this place is their service , its a real pleasure to have some genuinely smiling faces serving you . We met a wonderful lady hardeep ( if I remember correctly ) .All the staff were very hospitable despite of being crazily busy during the time we visited , The Bombay Spicy Prawns were just out of the world with a perfect Malai Kofta to compliment the spices with the cream .The Bread Basket was as well just perfect .We are certainly coming back to you .Thank

Located on the rooftop of Mustafa Centre doesn't make it exotic or special, merely making it difficult to reach. We must enter from Entrance 6 of the shopping centre and takes a lift that takes forever to reach (me and my friends decided to take the escalator instead).The food is admittedly slightly better than other places, but the pricing is ridiculous. $13 for kebab and $4 for plain rice. The kebab was disappointing as it's not whole meat, just sausage.Nothing special about the ambience. The waiter seated us indoor before we said we prefer outdoor. Then he pointed us to a semi-outdoor seats that turned out to be an indoor without aircon (stuffy). When we finished eating, we looked around the restaurant, there's a proper outdoor that the waiter didn't suggest at all.If you don't mind spending 15 minutes to reach the restaurant from the ground floor of the shopping mall to eat in a stuffy place with sticky tables, then give it a try
3
Nice location but not well maintain, average food, value for money, service average only, there are lot of room for improvements.
4
A great place for the tired shpppers to sit down and have their fill.
open from 11 to 11. Ont he top floor of the Mustafas shopping center. great food especially Indian.
1
Was shocked to see 2 rats just upon entering the roof top restaurant last evening.
Did not feel like ordering anything after that!!!
4
Great ambience because it is located on a terrace and food is also very good especially for indian taste. Value for money!
4
The view, ambiance, food are good. especially the mysore dosa and garlic naan.
this consider one of my fave restaurant
4
Best advantage is its location. After a busy tiring day shopping at Mustafa store you can visit this restaurant on top floor of mall and enjoy tasty Indian meal. Seating is nice both indoor and outdoor nothing spectacular but clean and functional seating space. Service is slow at times but great food quality probably compensate for slower service. Price is reasonable. Overall recommended for authentic Indian meals at affordable prices

On Monday, my wife and I took a taxi and we went to Little India hoping to eat at MTR, but it was closed. Since it was our first time there and we didn't have a 2nd plan, we thought it would be wise if we asked the local inhabitants. So, we kept our eyes open for any Indian looking people. It didn't take long before we saw a large jewelry store staffed with Indian men. We went inside the store, but feeling a little guilty because we were not shopping for jewelry, and we asked a younger looking man to recommend the best Indian restaurant in Little India. Before he could answer, an older looking man came to us and spoke in very thick Indian accent to his younger colleague, head shaking and all. They debated for awhile while we just stood there dumfounded. There was only one word I could recognize and it was "Mustafa". I asked the younger man where Mustafa was because he had the least Indian accent. He wanted to draw a map for us but the older man took the paper away and began to explain to me where Mustafa was. Here I felt guilty again because I couldn't understand him but he was so nice. He used hand gestures to show where Mustafa was and we pretended to understand to avoid embarrassment. We left the jewelry store and tried our best to remember his hand gesture and follow it. We asked another Indian man on the street for Mustafa and he pointed to a large building. We got to the entrance of this building and asked an Indian lady sitting at the Information booth for a "Mustafa Resturant". She pointed to a poster and said "7th floor, rooftop!" What began next was our version of Amazing Race. The building where we were at only had 4 floors. So we were told that we needed to get to a particular floor so that we can get to the other building. When we finally got to the other building, we were told that there is still one more building to go. When we got to the 3rd building we were lost and someone said to look on the floor and follow the Kebabs 'n Curries poster. Sure enough, we found the posters and we followed it through a maze of the largest and most complete supermarket I've ever seen. This is Mustafa. Finally, we found the elevator that will take us to the rooftop. We were so happy to reach the restaurant and hungry too. We tried everything on the buffet and we loved it. Place was a little warm because it seems to be a converted greenhouse. No AC. Toilets were nice and clean

We've eaten in few places in Little India and did not find a non veg place we liked. For veg place we now rely on Kailash Parbat. For non veg we will stick kebabs and curries. The price is an attraction. It's 30% cheaper than orchard road prices. It's on top of the world in little India. Lovely views. Inside and outside seating with something interesting always to notice. Not fine dining but this ain't a food court either. Service like most restaurants in little India, requires improvement. We ate the uthapam. Delicious. Then the famous Hyderabadi Mutton Briyani. And now we understand why it's famous. Very tasty of flavours. Lamb Rogan was okay, with good pieces of meat in a thin salty gravy. With some drinks, the bill came to only S$ 40 all inclusive. This is where the satifaction came from. It's an okay price. The place has strong attraction of customers as its very busy so be prepared to wait for the lift in peak hoursTips:- put your hand up and pray a server gets your attention and it will work.- if you do not like something, call the waiter and tell them and best to tell them to replace the dish with another option. - sit outside covered area. Very nice. Good natural light. Triple volume ceilings. Enjoy !!
4
Its on top of the latest mistafa extension, right under the dome with huge loud aircons blowing, otherwise the heat would be unbearable. Food is good from the buffet, a la carte also good but takes time to cook and bring. service is suprisingly not that good. Lots of waiters standing around, but takes 10 min to get an iced tea.
3
this place is not bad but it does not have anything that stands out..... it is very convenient if you are shopping at Mustafa...... you have all types of cuisines to choose from..... the kebabs are OK. the lassi os good.... we have tried the buffet once and the spread is not huge but not bad also....and some of the stuff tasted the way it should..... but then there is nothing that excites the taste buds. the staff is also likewise - not rude, not angry but then not very friendly and overly efficient.....
3
Ambience is very good.
Food average. You can get better indian food than this place.
Price is avg too.
Considering that most restaurants are higher in price than this one, I feel it's worth visiting if you are a budget traveller.
5
Excellent Indian food away from the manic streets below! Prices were very reasonable and service was exceptional and timely. Would return for sure.
4
I heard a lot about this place but frankly speaking was not that great. The taste was average. Perhaps you can get better and cheaper tandori stuff on the main road.
4
I liked the place as in just the food part..Ambience is not so good..But the food was really delicious..We ordered for biryani and butter chicken with some paranthas..the food experience was really very nice and not so costly as well...dont go for their buffet as it seemed to be not so worth...good promotion all over Mustafa market...Give it a try.
2
I personally didnt like the place so much. The food was quiet blend and limited in variety. The place is not well organized and shows that its being run as a non-core business. Given the food they are serving, I believe are much better options available within the same price range. They should stop promoting this place as a 'Fine Dining Experience' - its far far from it!!! ...
2
Ok. this is the most recent addition to Little India happening indian food scene. This is started by Mustafa and at the roof top of their new wing. It brings some change to the scene and with it's open concept quite interesting. Also the 'aesthetics' are good too.Now the positive things stop there. The most important part of any restaurant is the food it offers followed by 'service'. Unfortunately it's the worst food I ever tasted. Imagine Tandoori or 'chicken tikka' with "skin".. Butter Naans are just feels like 'papad' with some ghee poured on it.Their buffet was valued ~ 22 including whatever service charges and that's a rip off. Ala carte - the best food is Lucknowi chicken biryani. Chettinad chicken - waste of money. We got some chicken pieces (bones) filled with oil. Then comes the service - Mustafa class. So no need to talk.It's a huge disappointment

Very dissappointed with their indian chinese food. They should actually remove it form the menu.So much ketchup, tasteless, and full of oil. Left the meal halfway.Pricing is very reasonable but not worth if the food is awfulShopping at Mustafa landed us to their restaurant but a huge mistake

If you are a favourite of Indian cuisine and wanting to try south Indian or north Indian food, this place serves the best food. The Naan and Keema goes well together. Ask for Keema Mutter (mutton gravy) and it's rich with herbs and spices. The right amount of flavour and the aroma of the food is splendid. The only set-back is the serving time and serving staff. You need to keep asking for your food to be served and no service with a smile

Read some review online and was craving for indian food so decided to check it out. Had some trouble looking for the correct lift at mustafa centre to go up to the roof top where the restaurant is located. This place seems like a hot favourite amongst Indians as the restaurant was quite packed on a weekday night.I love the chicken tikka masala. The Butter chicken's chicken was good. The chicken was so tender but the taste did not really appeal to me. I guess it differs for people. The service was very slow. When we arrived, the waitress only gave the two of us one menu. I asked for an additional menu but it never came... it was quite annoying having to share the menu.Took awhile before we manage to find a waiter who is free to take our orders. He took the wrong order.... White rice came instead of Saffron rice. I was really annoyed but didn't want to wait any longer to start eating as i already waited for close to twenty mins for my food to arrive. All in all, unless you are out for a late night supper and has no better restaurant to go to or happens to be in mustafa and starving otherwise, don't make the effort to come down to try the food like I did

I was walking around Little India with a friend looking for dinner, when we stumbled across a sign for Kebabs & Curries outside the Mustafa Centre which we thought we'd try out. It was quite difficult to find: we entered the busy shopping centre and took a combination of the lift + escalators up to the top floor where we finally found the eatery. The inside area was booked out so we were ushered to an outdoor rooftop area which was quite serene, with plenty of greenery, neon lights, a water feature, and views of the Singapore skyline to add to the atmosphere.The service wasn't top class but the menu was extensive and authentic. I've eaten a fair amount of onion bhaji in my time and I must say this came close to the best I've tried. Our curry dishes came out fairly quickly; the presentation & taste was better than average when compared with other Indian restaurants I've dined at in the past. The mango lassi took away some of the kick from the deliciously hot chicken madras - by the end of our mains we were too full to even think about dessert. So we went shopping downstairs instead :)Altogether a great option for an affordably credible Indian meal in the heart of Singapore's famous Indian district
